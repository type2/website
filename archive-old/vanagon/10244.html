Subject: Antifreeze smell with heat

So Ervolina, Thomas R. says:
&gt; I looked at an '87 Vanagon last night (I'm still a wannabus) and smelled that
&gt; sweet smell when I turned the heat on.  (I think it was mostly from the
&gt; rear heater).  Is this something to be concerned about?
&gt; 
&gt; FWIW, it's a 87 GL Wolfsburg with the weekender package, AC, 4spd, 105K mi,
&gt; in excellent condition.  Asking 5500$.

Well, I think Mr. Mead might have something to say about this. ;)  

Check under the rear bench/bed seat.  on the middle right there is
a box that can be removed fairly easy. Just remove 3 screws and lift
it out.  You'll probably notice a blue puddle of (you guessed it)
coolant, or green if the previous owner didn't use the right coolant.
(Not a good sign).  The leak will be either the bleeder screw, from
the hoses, or the core itself.  Wipe up the hoses and around the
bleeder screw with a towel and then have someone else run the engine at
2000 rpm while you're peeking around to find where the leak is.  If
it's the bleeder screw or the hose(s), it will be pretty obvious.  If
it's the core is leaking, you'll have to unscrew/unbolt it so you
can have a real good look-see to find the leak.  Replacement cores
are expensive.  I've read $300 or so.  Look for one in a wrecking
yard if you need to.  If the bleeder screw is leaking, just get another
from VW with a gasket (about $2.00).  If it's the hose(s), just replace
them.
