&lt;&lt;  This question has been asked before, but I haven't seen an answer.
 Has a 1986 syncro proven to be be as good as any other year?  Has one 
 particular year proven to be better than the others? &gt;&gt;

I haven't heard any indication that the 1986's were any different than any
later years, aside from being a year older and likely to have more miles.

Good luck,
Jim Davis
