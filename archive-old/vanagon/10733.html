&gt; actually, i'm wondering if it will make any difference. there was No Clear
&gt; Consensus from the list (or anywhere else), so i'm gonna see if they last
&gt; another 75,000 miles this way. if they do, it doesn't prove anything. but
&gt; if they tear up, i'm sure gonna suspect something!!! :)
&gt; 
&gt; i'm thinking that maybe, just maybe, by reversing the axles, that the balls
&gt; will move into new wear areas of the races ... and so maybe last longer
&gt; (instead of wearing the old paths even deeper). no basis in science or
&gt; history supports this claim, however.

I have swapped joints on my rabbit truck and GTI.  Several years ago I replace
the original outer joints on my truck with new ones.  I kept the old ones in
stock.  I think they have over 120K miles on them (I can remember exactly but
I have it written down).  Last Sept I had the right out joint go bad on my GTI.
I was the original one but needed to be replaced.  I got the old left joint
from the truck and put it in the right side of the GTI.  The truck joint has
some wear on it but its from the left side.  I have been running the GTI since
then without any problem and that includes several autocrosses.  (DSP class
champion!)  I did use new cv joint grease in all cases.

FYI, the truck is an '82 and the GTI is an '83.  I wonder how long the joints
will last before needing replacement.
