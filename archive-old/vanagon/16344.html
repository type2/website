Subject: Defeating '75 bus self-destructs

VWers,

I have been monitoring this list on-and-off for about the last year.
The topic of discussion has been so intriguing I went out and picked
up a '75 bus (station wagon, but my 2yr old will only call it a bus).

My first order of business is to make repairs that will keep it from
self-destructing.  I've already lubed it, changed the oil and filter
and cleaned the screen.  The filter was really difficult to remove.
Anybody have a favorite brand tool for the filter (I tried 2, one
slipped, the other didn't clear everything).

The engine was rebuilt 2 yrs ago and has 2000mi on it (the previous
owner will give me the receipts as soon as he finds them).
Unfortunately all the rubber parts on the engine and in the engine
compartment are rotted away.  The first time I filled the tank, gas
started leaking from the vent line connection on the left side.

I found spark plug air seals, engine seal, road draft tube, and timing
hole plug listed in the WCM catalog.  What about all the other seals?
How about the alternator cover plate insert?  Aren't there supposed
to be seals around the a/c compressor?  The hoses and fittings would
be nice to have too though standard supply parts could be used.

The last item I found needing immediate attention is the distributor.
The one currently installed is purely mechanically advanced.  The
original must have had vacuum advance as well.  Any idea which
distributor belongs in this bus?  The bus was manufactured in 10/74,
chassis no. 225203xxxx and engine code ED008xxx.  This seems to be an
early '75 as the original owner was given a '74 owner's manual.

Any information will be appreciated.
I will be keeping good records of this adventure and look forward to
sharing as much as I can with this list.
