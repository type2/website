 bleed the system. You don't do this even when changing the coolant?

I have found it to be unnecasary.  Rev the engine to 2500 rpm with the t-stat
bypass open and the bleeder open.  Having a second person to close the front
bleeder when the air is purged.  While the system is purging, keep the engine
reved and add coolant to the bottle as the level goes down.  When the air is
purged, close the front bleeder, than install the pressure cap, ( top off
level first), and then let the engine idle.  It is important to do this with
the engine cold as expanding coolant will make this difficult.  Have both
heater valves open so the heater cores also get purged.  Test cooloing system
and fan operation before driving van.  You should be all set.
