Subject: re: seat belts

&gt;
&gt;&gt;I personally wouldn't be here today if not for seat belts.

 His passenger was not, and is
&gt;&gt;paralyzed from the waist down.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I'll wear 'em every time, and the van doesn't move until all passengers are
&gt;&gt;buckled up, too.

&gt;I've always been worried bout this kind of crash in my Westy.  Can't
&gt;imagine surviving front end impact like that even with seat belts fastened.
&gt;

Me either.  I got a real kick when Chrysler (excuse the language) came out
with an air bag.  So what?  Decelertaing from 60 mph while crumpling 18&quot; of
sheetmetal is going to kill you bigger than shit (sorry for the chrysler).
I guess at least you can have an open casket funeral...

I personally have had my life saved four times by a seat belt(twice while I
was driving).  One drunk lady turned left in front of my little (ALUMINUM
bodied) Rover 2000TC.  The car was junk (as in straight line from left
headlights to the right side A-pillar) and we were shaken but not stirred.
The other time I rolled my International in a freak off road accident which
is a great story, but I'll save it for alt.redneck.cornbinder
The other times were as a passenger in other peoples cars.  Just so you
people know this, the inertia reels in GM car seatbelts rarely work in an
accident.


&gt;Was hit broadside in an intersection, just ahead of the rear wheel in my 72
&gt;Westy, prolly the best place to be hit - right on the end of the frame
&gt;crossmember.  Spun the bus 180 degrees, and I drove away, after repairing
&gt;shifter which was 90 degrees out, pointed at me instead of aft.  Bus
&gt;suffered only sheetmetal damage, no alignment problem at all.
&gt;
I was shocked when I weighed our Westy and found it was 3800 pounds, right
up there with a big 4 door Pontiac.  So while being ahead of the front
wheels and behind some .059 sheet metal isn't going to do me any good, at
least I'm not going alone...
