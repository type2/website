Subject: Re: why 2 oil switches (was: how engine oil degrades) oils)

Oil pressure that is too high is detremental also.  At the very least it
will blow out all the oil seals, which will let all the oil leak, and then
the low pressure switch will get a chance to warn you.  And if there is a
high pressure situation it is likely there is so other major problem
causing it.

&gt;As to why there are two sensors, I guess VW engineers work in strange
&gt;and wondoreous ways...

&gt; &gt; Hi there,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have experience problems with my oil light and buzzer coming on while
&gt;driving
&gt; &gt; my 86 Vanagon Syncro, and I've concluded that it was because I was
&gt;using too
&gt; &gt; thin oil for the temperature outside.  When I use 20-40 it rarely happens.
