	Don't know if you saw my post re: point lube 'bout a week or so
ago... but I was having terrible trouble finding it anywhere.  I tried
Car Quest on a whim.  Took three employees about 10 minutes to find it.
Really don't think I'd shop there routinely for any reason.  Hopefully,
if other folks want the point lube, the can go in armed with the right
part number now. :)
