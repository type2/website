&gt;Well, I went to the DMV today to get the '64 Single Cab registered
&gt;and sure enough, they needed to see the vehicle.  Of course, the
&gt;phone droid I called earlier said I didn't have to have it there.
&gt;Glad the DMV hasn't changed much since my last visit. :[  So they
&gt;willingly took my money and printed up an official looking piece 
&gt;of paper and told me I had to have the truck weighed so they'd have
&gt;an accurate weight measurement and then they would have to check
&gt;to make sure the VIN no. I gave them from the paper work matched
&gt;the vehicle.  
&gt;
&gt;So I'm looking all over the pickup for the VIN and can't find it
&gt;anywhere.  Does anyone know where I should be looking?

On the passenger side, on the air box in the roof.  There's a silver plate.
Its also in the engine
compartment, just in front of the apron, on the right side.
