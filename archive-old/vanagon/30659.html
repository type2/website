On my 1988, water appeared to be coming in via the knob
as described by Ron.  Turned out that there was a myriad
of fine cracks in the plastic skylight itself, close to the
rim where it seats on the seal.  A liberal application of 
outdoor grade clear silicone smeared over the cracks cured
(no pun) the leak.  (And we stopped turning it down so 
tight!).
