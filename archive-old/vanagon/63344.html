Yep, I have one of these -- came with my '81.  Mine is brown.  The base is
actually 13.5&quot; by 6.5&quot;.

&gt;Perhaps I was a little ambiguous when I said in my previous post that
&gt;this particular item sat on the top of the Dashboard.  I have a picture
&gt;(actually sort of a watercolor painting) in a 1981 dated Accessories
&gt;Brochure (#W53 111 3008), &quot;Vanagon/Pickup Accessories&quot; that shows it
&gt;sitting just to the right of the Ashtray.  I have seen it several times
&gt;in real life (what a concept!) and it appears to be about 15 inches long
&gt;and about 4 or 5 inches wide.  Caption on the picture reads:  &quot;Dash Tray:
&gt; This thermo formed ABS plastic tray is specifically designed for your
&gt;Vanagon's dashboard.  Hold (sic) two beverage containers, toll money,
&gt;sunglass and other small items for your driving convenience&quot;.
