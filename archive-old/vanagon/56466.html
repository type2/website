Subject: Re: 85 Westy LP fill valve

I am travelling to ALta from the West Coast and am staying in Phoenix for
a few days. I tried to fill up my propane tank and broke the 10% valve
off. I have tried to take it apart but the corrosion is pretty bad. Does
anyone know where I can find a replacement fill valve for my lp tank. I
have tried several places and have been told they do not make this part
anymore because it is unsafe. They use a float system in lp tanks now. Any
suggestions would be appreciated. I have been to several Lp places and
Mega RV stores and they have all told me  that I was S.O.L
thanks
