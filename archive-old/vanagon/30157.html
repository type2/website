Subject: Reinforced Snow Tires

Is there such a thing?  I've been calling around and none of the Tire
shops has a Snow Tire with reinforced sidewall.  When I got my 87
Vanagon (non-syncro) last year, it came with two  (fairly worn)
snows.  These are Vredestein Snow+  (non-reinforced, 36 psi, 185 SR14).
They did well in the snow, but it wasn't until the spring when I
got four new michelin MXL reinforced's, that I realized how much better
the reinforced tires are -- major improvement.

The Tire Rack wanted to sell me Bridgestone Blizzaks, and I can get
Nokia NR09 (same tread as Hakkepelitta's which I have on my Jetta)
locally, but these are both passenger tires.  Any recommendations?
