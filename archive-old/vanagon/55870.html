Subject: 1980 vs 1981??

Vanamaniacs,
Does anyone know of any visible distinctions between the 1980 &amp; 1981
Vanagons?  I mean if one were to see a 1980 or 81 driving down the street,
how could you tell which year it was?

If you're reading this from the Type2 list, please email me directly, since I
don't subscribe to that list.

Thanks,
Jim Davis
