Richard,

        I put a set of 4 on my camper this summer.  I have the 8 ply
version.  I payed $76.00 each and that included everything.  I don't know if
that is a good deal or not.  It sounds from you note that I might have been
able to do better.  The tires are quiet and the car rides and handles well.
     One issue with my tires is that they put low pressure valves on so I
can only put a max of 40 PSI in.  The tires go up to 75pse.  They are
currently at about 36psi and seem fine.
        Anyone know if there is an advantage or disadvantage to putting them
up to a higher pressure.  They only smuch a little in the back.
