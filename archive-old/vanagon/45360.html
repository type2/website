Subject: Re: Splitty Deluxe Skylight Tint?

Another newbie 20+ Window owner question:  Being up close and personal 
with only a few Sunroof Deluxes I just now noticed that the skylights in 
my '64 are tinted a dark green, while the ones in the '63 are clear.  Is 
this a difference in year models or an option?  If an option, does it 
have an M-Code?  TIA.

no, it is stock.  64-67 skylight windows are tempered and tinted green.
   earlier ones are clear, and may or may not be tempered as per year.    i
believe they were really into laminated glass in 63, so yours would probably
be that.
