&gt; If this was in the FAQ, it didn't stick in my mind.  When was the
&gt; sliding side door introduced on the bus?  I've seen several WTB-ads
&gt; for '5x Barndoors.  That implies to me that you could also get '5xs
&gt; with sliding doors?  How about the '6x model years?  All sliders?

The sliding door was intoduced in 1964, as an option, and mandatory in
1968

A barndoor is a pre-march'55 bus with a HUGE engine lid - goes all the
way up to the beltline.

Login then follows that they didn't make any '5xs with sliders, but
you never know...
