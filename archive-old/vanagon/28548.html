Subject: Gauged Animals?

Air-cooled folk:

We've seen some extremes here lately.  Here's a VW-related
extreme.  Or is it?

I recently read a description of a split window bus for sale
which listed the gauges installed as extras.  Among the
usual was:

Cylinder head temperature, all cylinders.

I'm familiar with the VDO cylinder head gauge with a &quot;ring&quot;
sensor which slips of the spark plug before you thread it in
the head.  Usually cylinder 3, right?  Because #3 runs
hottest because of oil cooler?

When I saw the above notation, I envisioned *four* gauges,
one for each cylinder.  Is this overkill?  Is this
obsession?  Is this insurance?  Is there a 4-cylinder gauge?

Keep in mind that the owner also replaced standard fuses
with *breakers* (aircraft-type) so all he had to do was push
a button.

Ground Control! Ground Control!  Number 2 is running hot!
I'll just cut spark to it and cruise on three cylinders for
a while and land at the nearest strip!
