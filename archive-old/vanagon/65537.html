&gt; Howdy,
&gt; My O2 sensor on my 87'Wolfburg seems &quot;stuck&quot;  I tried removing it with my
&gt; O2 sensor socket and a 3/8rachet but the darn thing won't bulge at all!
&gt; Anyone has any killer ideas?  Taking off the cat will be a real pain, I
&gt; hope isn't the only way.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone wanna take a crack at this?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks

Try applying a good penetrating oil such as Kano Labs &quot;Kroil&quot; with the
exhaust system cold.  Allow it an hour or so to do its thing.  You may
have to try breaking the sensor loose with the engine up to operating
temp, or heat the sensor socket area of the catalytic converter head
pipe with a torch.  It should come loose.  Be sure and use a 6-point
socket and get more leverage, ie a 1/2 drive.
