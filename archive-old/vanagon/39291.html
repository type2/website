Subject: Vacuum Distributor Available

Maybe this is well known information, but.....

With all the discussion on the list regarding the good points of a vacuum
distributor and the bad points of a centrifugal (009) distributor, I wanted
to find out if the vacuum units were still available.  I called my local VW
dealer (Central VW - Dallas) - they could get one and it was around $402.00!!!!

So I called around to the FLAPS and foreign FLAPS.  Beck/Arnley offers a
rebuilt unit for $84.00.  I bought one - it is part number 185-0111, for a
'71 bus.  It includes points and condenser.  I thought that the price was
reasonable when compared with $40-$60 for a 009.

Anyway, FYI.  I've no connection with any of the vendors.  It's just
something I wondered about, and thought others had also.
