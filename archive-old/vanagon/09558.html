&gt;   How much further is it to Death Valley? I've been there in March and it was
&gt;   wonderful. I think we took two days to get there though - in which case that
&gt;   wouldn't work for a weekend. I was lobbying with the family to go there for 
&gt;   Easter week, but - as usual - I'm being out-gunned in favor of a trip to 
&gt;   the _at_*!%## in-laws.

Death Valley looks to be at least 100 miles farther than Red Rock, and is
in the worst possible location as it is &quot;behind&quot; the Sierras, which is bad
for the Bay area people, and is a long drive from Southern Cal as well.
I have not been to Death Valley so I can't comment on its appropriatness
for the next pre-tour.  The distances don't look good, though...
