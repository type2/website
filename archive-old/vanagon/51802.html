Subject: Re: Ultimate Vanagon Bra

The best bra I've seen is the Colgen Bra which sells for about $130.  I've
had one for the past 4 years and it protects well (just remember to clean the
underside frequently if you live in the east) and it remains quiet even at 80
mph.  There's a parts store on the Limbo web site that sells them: Volks
Motor Sport _at_ 408-462-9424.
