Subject: Re:1974 Bus price

I'd say that $2500 is way too high of a price to pay.  I've got a 1974 
Westy and I paid $1400.  Of course, it doesn't have a rebuilt motor and 
it has a dent or too.  But, it is in &quot;better than average&quot; shape.  I 
wouldn't pay more than $1800 for a standard Bus.  And that's only with a 
new motor, a perfect interior, everything new mechanically and a new 
paint job as well.  Of course, there are tons of buses here in Seattle, 
so maybe the prices are lower.
