Subject:       Re: Light for synchro

&gt;When I bought the synchro in 86 they told me the synchro light went 
&gt;on with the headlights.  It just stopped working and I was told the 
&gt;light goes on when the all wheel drive is engaged. T or F?  If 
&gt;true, how is it hooked up?

What I have found strange is that there are 2 other sockets for lights 
in that display panel. Center diff, and Front diff. Any ideas if 
these were ever used. 

Other  empty sockets are in the tail  lights.  Those would make nice 
tail/fog lights... Anybody ever work that out?
