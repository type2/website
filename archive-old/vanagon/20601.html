&gt; I like this system because I don't have to get into the top of the water tank
&gt; thru the storage bins, and don't have to worry about drying out the tank,
&gt; or what's growing in there.  It does occasionally occur to me to wonder 
&gt; whether
&gt; the clorox is bad for the tank or the pipes, but so far, so good.  Comments?

I just cleaned out my tank from the top last weekend, and this sounds like a 
great idea, Martha. I left some tap water in the tank for about a week longer 
that I should have, and it started to get a little slimy. I like the chlorine 
idea. I really don't think the chlorine would bother the system at all.
