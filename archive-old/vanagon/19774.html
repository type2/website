&gt; A droplet of gasoline, however tiny, has a million times more mass than a

&gt; a portion of the fuel charge to strike the walls of the intake manifold or
&gt; cylinder head casting and to form a film of liquid gasoline.  This process
&gt; occurs more easily if the surfaces are rough.

I've heard this argument before, and also the opposite one (that a
smooth surface will cause the fuel to condense on the walls of the
intake manifold).  Some books say to leave the walls rough.  Does
anyone have some definitive proof (i.e. plotted HP/torque curves) that
one or the other is better?
