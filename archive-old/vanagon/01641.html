     I just bought a 85 vanagon with 137000 miles on it and
need some information an how to get a lot more miles on it
before it dies. I have read about moving the cv joints to
the other side, and I will do that. Any more suggestions will
be appreciated. I have put 600 miles on the van since I got
it and I am getting 21 miles per gallon, is this about right
or should I be getting better?
