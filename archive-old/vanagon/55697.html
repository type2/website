Subject: Advice needed: Accessory pricing questions? 

Hi again,
	What are your suggestions for building the ultimate camper/road 
machine.  Here are some accessories I am planning on buying with my 
camper upgrade on my new '88 Wolfsburg.  Does anyone know of anywhere I 
can get any of this stuff cheaper?  Also, what are your inputs as far 
worthwhile accessories?

		Swivel Seat:  $420  (Is this worth it?  do y'all who have 
			it like it?  Or should I just blow it off?)
		Porta-Potty:  $125   (Is this necessary?  It seems like a 
					big space waster to me)
		Pop top:  $3250
		Sink/stove/fridge/cabinets:  $4750 (actually, this 	
			includes a lot more, so if the price looks high, 
			that's why--cutains, fire ext, carpeting, 	
			lights, water holder etc. etc.)
		Bra for front:	$125   (Do you like it?)
		Sun Roof:	$295
		Luggage Rack:	$125
		Awning:		$490	(Seems like nice to have)
		Tent for rear:	$325	(envelopes rear to extend 	
			back--also seems like a very nice thing to have)
		
TIA for all advice,
Happy camping,
Thad
