&gt; BBBRRRRRRR!!!! Woke up to an eye opening -12F (-55F wind chill) in Nebraska
&gt; today. Not surprisingly, although it was a first, the vanagon would not
&gt; start, not even with the help of a neighbors running truck.
&gt; 
&gt; This cold snap is expected to last well into next week, so I am soliciting
&gt; advise from experienced cold-climate listees. What are some good strategies
&gt; for getting going on sub-zero mornings?

OPTIONS:
1) Install a block heater. 
2) Even if you do have a block heater then a 100 watt light bulb will do
a good job. Put the light under engine sump. 
3) If you live in Nebraska, you might have access to bales of straw. Put
a row of straw along the sides and along the back to minimize the snow
and wind chill and keep the heat of the light bulb in.
4) Put a 1500 watt heater inside the van. Take the covers off of the
engine compartment and the battery box. The heater will keep the engine
and battery warm and make it more comfortable for the driver in the
morning.
5) Take a spare battery inside and put it on a trickle charger. In the
morning take it out to the van and use a jumper to boost the battery.
6) Use synthetic engine oil, transaxle and differential grease
7) -12F is real dangerous, so relax, give up and have a hot chocolate.

&gt; 
&gt; When I lived in Vermont (pre-vw), I would take my battery in the house on
&gt; cold nights and that usually worked, so that is probably going to be my
&gt; first course of action.
&gt; 
&gt; All opinions welcomed.
