&gt;I know this one was discussed a few weeks back, along with a good 
&gt;procedure for flushing the power steering system, but it was 
&gt;mentioned that a special VW fluid was needed. I just checked with the 
&gt;local VW dealer and they said standard ATF Dexron is fine. What 
&gt;gives? Is the special stuff only for certain years or certain types 
&gt;of steering pump/rack? 
&gt;
&gt;My fluid looks clean, and is a nice bright blue colour, but I do get 
&gt;some dead spots in the steering, usually at low speeds. I thought 
&gt;Dexron was red or purple, so I'm a little unsure about dumping the 
&gt;stuff that's in there now.
&gt;
&gt;Also - I'm having trouble finding a GL-4 rated 80w or 80w90 gear oil 
&gt;- they all seem to be GL-4/5, or GL-5/6. I've heard that the GL 
&gt;rating is important for proper syncro operation. Can someone 
&gt;recommend a brand which is known to work well in an '88? I'd prefer 
&gt;synthetic, but I'll take what I can find here (BC).
&gt;
&gt;

ATF wasthe original factory fill for the power steering.  Due to complaints
of noises and poor performance in cold weather, VW started using the special
Audi fluid which is  lighter viscosity.  I find the lighter fluid promotes
leaky racks.   recomend synthetic ATF for this application.  Solves the cold
weather blues.  Ypur transmission will work fine with a GL-5 or better
gearlube.  I use Mobil 1 SHC 75w-90.  Works great.
