Subject: Puddles inside the bus

 It rained last night and when I hopped into the '74 this morning I noticed
 a puddle of water on the floor in front on the passengers side. Window open?
 Nope. Went looking around on the outside and found - Yikes! - RUST UNDER THE
 WINDSHIELD!! This must be the result of bad karma from having given Sami so
 much grief about driving in the salt of Missouri. But seriously, what has to
 be done to fix this? Does new metal need to be welded in? Has anybody on the
 list made this repair?

 Unhappily realizing that the years are indeed passing by for &quot;Young Fred&quot;
