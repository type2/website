Dave E. has done a very good and concise job of describing the many
different Westfalia interiors that have appeared in split windows. Much
like the busses themselves the rule of thumb to &quot;never say never&quot; is in
order when it comes to Westy interiors. Just when I think i have the
absolute last word on a certain camper configuration sure enough something
pops out of the woodwork to contradict my previous &quot;irrefutable
knowledge&quot;;). It is worth knowing that Westfalia offered interiors in
Europe that were not offered over here (unless the bus has been imported
over here). I don't claim to be a Westfalia expert only another interested
camper owner. Michael Steinke who runs the &quot;Westfalia Registry&quot; in Germany
is a _very_ knowledgeable person to talk/write to!

The only addendum I would make is that there are as many different
Westfalia wood slat woodracks as there are Westfalia interiors (ditto that
for tents!) They evolved over the years as the interiors did too. I would
concur with Dav'e assessment that the so-23 is probably the most sought
after interior from an aesthetic perspective however personally from my
point of view the later so-42 interior (especially witha  walkthru) made a
better utilization of space.(this continues to be true each new model year,
i think that that space has been generally better utilized over the years)

Each of the different so (&quot;so&quot; is some long german words that roughly
translate into &quot;special model&quot;) interiors has their plusses and minusses.
Some times I would like to pick the &quot;best features&quot;  of each of the so
interior and combine them all in to the &quot;ultimate&quot; camper interior (not
exactly a purists dream)!

As Dave mentioned Rick and Susan did a geat job a few years back giving the
history of old Westfalia campers, also Todd Swangstu runs a mag out of
Toledo, Ohio called &quot;Campbox News&quot;
(usual disclaimers apply) that caters to all years of Westy's and is very
informative.

I will just add a few point to the below text...


&gt;
&gt;1956-58  Campbox interior (don't know the SO number)  Wood cabinets
&gt;         including a roll-top desk type cabinet over the engine &amp;
&gt;         gas tank shelf that blocked the view out the back window.
&gt;         Submarine roof hatch.
&gt;
&gt;1958-61  SO-23 interior.  Arguably the classiest and most sought after
&gt;         Westy interior.  Wood cabinets w/ brass trim.  Put into bench
&gt;         seat Kombis.  Submarine roof hatch.

this configuration also came (optionally??) amongst other things w/ the
much sought after &quot;beakers&quot; essentially spun aluminum drink glasses
&gt;
&gt;1962-63  SO-34 interior.  Wood cabinets w/ brass trim.  Jump seat
&gt;         between 2 rear cabinets.  Put into walk-thru Kombis, but seat
&gt;         back bulkheads were cut out and a boat type bench flip seat
&gt;         was installed.  Submarine roof hatch.

this bus also came (optionally??) amongst other things w/ the much sought
after &quot;beakers&quot; essentially spun aluminum drink glasses, and a removeable
table (designed to be used outside) that mounted in the rim of the spare
tire
&gt;
&gt;1962-63  SO-35 interior.  Same as SO-34 except white Melamine or
&gt;         Formica over plywood cabinets w/o brass trim.
&gt;
&gt;1964-67  SO-42 interior.  Most common Westy interior.  Cabinets were
&gt;         plywood w/ woodgrain Formica finish.  Came in both bench seat
&gt;         and walk-thru Kombis.  Came with or without poptop.  If
&gt;         original will have A42, B42, or C42 on vin plate behind
&gt;         passenger seat.

so-42 models switched from having cloth on the interior seats to the
familiar &quot;gold&quot; coloured vinyl that was offered on Westy interiors up until
late 1971
&gt;
&gt;1964-67  SO-44 interior.  Another sought after Westy interior.  Were
&gt;         used in some Westys and a lot of Dormobiles.  Cabinets were
&gt;         plywood w/ woodgrain Formica finish.  Came in bench seat
&gt;         Kombis only.  There was a row of cabinets behind the front
&gt;         seat bulkhead that housed a stove and icebox.  I suspect
&gt;         Dormobile chose this as one of their interiors due to the
&gt;         extra structural integrity of the front seat bulkhead keeping
&gt;         the frame rigid even after cutting the huge hole in the roof
&gt;         for their top.  I've never seen an ORIGINAL walk-thru Dormobile.

I have never seen a walk thru dormobile either, although I have seen a
&quot;flip seat&quot; dormobile which i _assume_ is original. This camper is owned by
American League (?) baseballer Bret Barberie (try saying that three times
fast) who now plays for ???. There are not too many so-44 interior campers
around.
