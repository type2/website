&gt; use for winter roads in PA.  Maybe you're not that far off... (or maybe it was
&gt; just that my tongue felt like the asphalt on the road at the time)...
Well, I ought-to throw in my contribution here for the defense of grits also.
In fact, as I am writing this, I am enjoying a nice bowl of grits. 
For those of you who don't know what grits are, when cooked, they resemble
cream of wheat, but seem to be a bit more coarse.  Anyway, to the point,
grits make a very good combination with smithfield ham and red-eye gravy.
Those of you that don't know about smithfield ham (ric, for example) ... guess
you'll just have to use your imagination.
How is this related to vanagons?  Well I am eating this right before I go out
and start my chevy pickup to tow my camper back to bozeman ... it is kind-of
cold outside and grits make a wonderful meal which is quick.  I think 
everyone ought to have a container of grits in their campers ... they are easy
to make, and quick.  In addition, you can use the uneaten grits for better
traction.

I drive, when it runs, a 1982 diesel vanagon camper.   When it doesn't, it is
powered by a 1979 cheyv pickup.
