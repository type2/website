Subject: Dilbert and minvans (f)

As I work in a software development team there seems to alot of &quot;engineer
humor.&quot; Engineering humor sometimes is as exciting as a peanut butter
sandwich with a butter milk chaser is to a person with serious cotton mouth. 
The neighboring C++ guru handed out copies of the Dilbert cartoon the shows
the boss stating that &quot;Our goal is the write bug-free software. I'll pay a
ten dollar bonus for every bug that you find and fix.&quot; Dilbert and the team
shouts &quot;YAHOO, We're rich!, yes,yes,yes!&quot; The boss says &quot;I hope this drives
the right behavior.&quot; Dilbert's coworker says &quot;I'm gonna write me a new
minivan this afternoon!&quot;

I was going through a QA  routine of his work at that moment (a scarey
thought in it's self).  I therefore took the cartoon, crossed out the word
&quot;minivan&quot; scribbled &quot;microbus&quot; next to it and circled it in red and wrote
&quot;QA&quot; over it. I put it back in his mail box for his review... Being known as
the resident VW &quot;freak,&quot; he got the point. He knows how much I like the
boring minivans with &quot;Baby on board&quot; signs. =)

HoHum, next?
