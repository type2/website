Subject: Overheated!!!!!

A friend recently drove his type 1 powered '68 bus after the belt had 
failed, meaning no cooling air, and overheated the engine.  It will still 
turn over and did not seize up.

He has been told that he has scored the cylinder walls and that all he needs 
to do to get it running again is to replace the pistons, rings and 
cylinders.  He is interested in this as he had rebuilt this engine only 20k 
miles ago.

Is this reasonable, or will it really need new bearings and some head work.  
I would think that would be where the heat would be.  I've also though of 
buying this project from him, hence my interest.  Am I looking at a new 
engine to do it right, or what could be done that would be ok for say 50k miles?

TIA,
