Subject: Re: throttle valve switch

&gt; Does anyone have experience with making adjustment to the &gt;throttle

&gt; valve switch on a 2.1 ?

&gt; I have checked the Bentley book. It seems pretty straight forward.

Patrick i have a 1987 Syncro and have adjusted the switch several times.
 I've found that the best way is to completly remove the throttle body
housing with the switch attached, and do the adjusting on a flat surface.
 Adjustment can be made using the guidelines outlined in the Bently Manual.
 To correctly adjust the switch you should have an electrical continuity
tester and a feeler gauge to exactly determine when the switch opens and
closes.  Adjustment is made by loosening the small allen bolts at the base of
the throttle housing and turning one of them.  I tried to adjust the switch
by &quot;feel&quot; before i had the tester, and my van ran funny when cold.  I hope
this helps.

Mike
