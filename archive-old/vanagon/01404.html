Subject: Re: engine sub/heat/towing




Keep this engine sub thread going, it makes great reading. I think
we could compile good manual from the various experiences.

On the subject of aircooled van heating, check closely the condition
of the main duct under the passenger compartment. It is &quot;insulated&quot;
with some sort of fibre which rather than keeping the heat in,
tends to collect water/salt and rust out the duct. The duct looks
ok from a distance but...

If I hadn't gotten a water cooled van, I planned on modifying my 72
van by leading a duct from the inlet of the electric fan in the engine bay,
to a hole cut in the spare tire recess on the lefthand side of the
rear passenger compartment. I got the idea from those kits for
type 1 and early buses (gene berg?) that incorporate an electric
squirrel cage fan. If the added duct created more engine noise,
I thought that boarding off the well (leaving some sort of hole), and adding
insulated baffles would help. It was one of those plans hatched
on a draughty chilly drive.

I have seen vanagons with a trailer hitch mounted on a bar that was
attached to the two towing loops?/brackets? with a somple bolt and
plate arrangement. It looked quite strong anyone out there have
such a hitch?
