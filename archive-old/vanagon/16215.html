Subject: Fixin' Rot Holes

Friends;

    Ramona has rot-holes on both of her rear quarters, on the corners. What's
the best way to patch this up?? I'd like very much to do it myself, and would
rather avoid buying replacement pieces that aren't original....what is the
process for patching these holes up? What do I need to buy for the project??
I have seen a gauze-like roll you can buy and the pasty stuff for sale in
Whitney's catalog...._dot_can I find these materials at a shop??
Thx**Rach &amp; 'Mona
