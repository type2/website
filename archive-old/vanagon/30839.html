Subject: Re[2]: Barn Door P/U (was 23-Window Whore Story)

     
     &gt;actually, the whole 'barndoor' thing is a misnomer.  Anyone seen a 
     &gt;barn door that opens up?  Duh.  Someone told me it was like a 
     &gt;'barndoor' on a union suit, but that opens down.   Barn doors are 
     &gt;like the cargo doors,  and an old geezer from the netherlands said 
     &gt;thats why they called them that.  Makes sense.  So why someone 
     &gt;singled out the pre 3/55 model to be 'barndoor', i dont know.  Oughta 
     &gt;be a different name,  INHO
     
     gotta aggree with that.
     
     Lee.
