Subject: No offense, but....

I'm new to this list and have been a subject to &quot;internet fraud&quot; before.
I'm not trying to be a jerk or anything (just want to make that clear since
there do seem to be a few that don't get along here :), but I would like to
order some stickers and need someone to let me know if this is legit.

Once again, I'm not wanting to ruffle any feathers--just trying to cover my
bases!

Thank you

Matthew Drew
