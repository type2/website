What year is your bus/Vanagon? As mentioned the worst possible outcome is
too much end play by virtue of a bad locking plate/shimset. However it may
also be due to improper shim sizes or quantity (three's the max). Does your
flywheel have five bolts or one large gland nut? Have you noticed any big
bearing knock? Checking the flywheel end play is a delicate procedure. The
best case scenario would be an improperly set end play that has somehow
loosened the dowels but that has yet to result in bearing damage. If so,
end play adjustment is  best left to the pros.....DC
