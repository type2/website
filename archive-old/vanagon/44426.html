&gt;Also Can I replace my oil sensor with something that will tell me actual 
&gt;preasure and tempurature? Does VDO make a guage, can I get it with a tach

&gt;speedomitor, odomitor w/ reset, and tach all on three guages which would 
&gt;fit nicelt in my dash, that's why I want VDO.

A common setup on baywindow busses is three gauges side by side under the
radio cutout.  VDO has lots to choose from, such as oil temperature, oil
pressure (I think there's a sender that replaces your current one, with a
connection for the guage AND the dash light), cylinder head temp. voltmeter,
clock, etc.  They also make a tach. that fits in the empty location to the
right of the speedometer.  Check the ads in Hot VWs and VW Trends.
