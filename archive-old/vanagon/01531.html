Perhaps Mr Spock should be looking for a TRANSPORTER handbook...

hahahahhahah...couldn't resist...Spock...transporter...

Ok, its early in the morning, it was the 4th yesterday...too many
beers...now not enough coffee

Seriously, you may want to  get the Bentley VW Transporter Repair
Manual from JC Whitney or Classic Motorbooks, or directly from
Bentley themselves...._dot_use it to go along with the &quot;Idiot&quot; book.
