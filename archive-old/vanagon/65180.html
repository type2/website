Subject:      ECU Found (was Emergency - Need ECU)

Kudos to Doug Bensen (db25_at_umail.umd_dot_edu) for the suggestion to contact
Kyle Wade at VW-Motorsports for an ECU.  Kyle happened to have a good
used ECU on hand and is shipping it overnight to me.  I had totally
forgotten about the post he had made awhile back about having certain
hard-to-find ECU's and I did have it archived for reference (I archive
[and back up daily] almost everything from the lists for reference - ya
never know when yer gonna need it).

And kudos to Kyle himself for making the extra effort to take the time to
get it out to me, even though UPS had already picked up for the day from
him.

Also thanks to Ken Lewis (kdlewis_at_juno_dot_com) for his further diagnostics
help in the *possible* problem with the distributor advance stuck in the
full advanced position - didn't think to check this area and will do so
when I get up to Klamath tomorrow afternoon.  I will again further check
the entire ignition system (I have the parts) just to be sure, based on
his informative questions and answers.

And last but not least, thanks to Rex Eastman (vws4sale_at_inreach_dot_com) for
alerting the list(s) of my predicament.  Although he couldn't offer
direct help, he was able to keep myself focused on what directions and
options to take.  He even offered the flat-bed car/van trailer, but I
don't have nor know of anyone I could call with a vehicle capable of
towing this monstrosity back to Redding (remember, it's an Automatic) if
it came to that.

I'll let everyone know how it turns out when I get back.
