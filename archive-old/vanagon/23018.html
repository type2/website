&gt;      I've just booked me and my camper on to an ferry for Ireland. They 
&gt;      need to know how high it is.
&gt;      Does any one know? It is a '78 with no pop-top. The hight limit is 2 
&gt;      meteres and there is only one space on the high vehicle section of the 
&gt;      ferry.
&gt;      
That may be close. My bus stands around 6 1/2 feet. That is with a roof
rack, which is about the same extra height as a pop-top. I would reserve
the high vehicle spot if you can.
Better safe that roofless...
Richard
