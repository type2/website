To All:

I'm not up to date on prior vanagon postings but you've experienced the
typical valve seat problems it may be worth your time to contact Mark
Stephens in Tehachapi, California (805 area code; sorry, I don't have the
number).  He does a good head rebuild for less than $200, has a good
reputation.
