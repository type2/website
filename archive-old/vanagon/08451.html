Subject: 34 PICT 3 Revisited
Date: Tue, 20 Dec 1994 08:39:17 -0600 (CST)

Ok, I put a kit into my 34 PICT 3.  I replaced all of the fuel lines 
that I could find.  I replaced the rotor, cap and points in the 009.  
It came with the bus and I don't have the original.  Oh, I installed 
and set the points with the dwell meter before I messed with the carb.
I fired it up and it ran like a little top for about two minutes and 
then died like the fuel had been shut off.  The new fuel filter looked
funny so I installed it the right way.  I had it in backwards.  I 
started it up and it ran like a top again.  I set the idle to about 
1000 and was letting it warm up.  About 5 minutes later it died again.
This time, all attempts to get it to idle failed.  Just like it was 
before.  The advance it set at 10 BTDC.  I am now going to start 
replacing all other things it might be.  The seals in the intake 
manifolds are first.  Frank had said once he replaced his with 
urethane ones.  Are these good and are they available mail order.  
Next is the 3/4&quot; hose running up to the brake servo.  I had thought 
that maybe it died when the choke kicked off, thinking I had set it up
wrong.  I disabled it as per Muir with no change.  A five mile run to 
get the engine good and warmed up did nothing either.  I have smoother
acceleration and more power.  I am going to assume for now that the 
carb was overhauled properly and attack these other things which need 
to be done anyway.  So, I guess I am wondering why it would idle 
perfectly for 7+ minutes and then go back to its old ways.  I am 
hesitant to replace with carb with a new one since I hope to replace 
whole engine/carb setup in the next six to eight months.  I know it 
might have leaks itself but I don't see how it could idle so well at 
first and then start leaking.  If you stayed with me this long I thank
you.  Now, send me some good advice.  Oh, stock 1600DP, 71 bus.

ps  If you caught my post yesterday about Gene Berg: a receipt showing
my full charges followed the package by a couple of days.  :)
