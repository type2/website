Subject: instrumented trip; heater pipe question

Well, I got back from the WA coast last weekend. All gauges work fine, and
it gives me more to think about as I'm driving. Climbing one sees head and
oil temperatures climbing right with you! Never too excessive though.

Cruising along for an hour or so at 55-60 mph I see the head stabilized at
500F, oil at 210F.  But when I stop, or have to slow down for awhile going
through town - the head temp drops to 350-400F but the damn oil shoots up
to 230F! Best strategy in this case seems to be to simply shut it down, as
simply revving the engine didn't seem to help any. Got to have air flowing
past that oil cooler I guess!

Another interesting point: once the oil hits 210F the pressure pretty much
follows the tach: 2K RPM ~= 20 psi; 3K RPM ~= 30 psi, up to 4K (I haven't
gotten
past that point.) When it's cool, the oil is at 60 psi or more.
(This is all using Castrol 20W-50 oil)

I took a few pictures of the van out on the beach, but didn't get around to
scanning them today - hopefully will have them later. I forgot to take a
picture of the gauge setup though.

Now, for the question of the day: my missing heater pipe has arrived. (Left
hand
pipe connecting shroud to heat exchanger.) I'm no topology expert, but I
have not been able to figure out how to get that pipe attached - it just
doesnt fit
into the space available. Somethings going to have to give, the question is
whether it will be the exhaust or the fan shroud. After reading all the
horror
stories about VW exhaust replacement, I'm a bit hesitant to mess with that.
(I already discovered that I have a piece of steel pipe where my cat converter
was - on the end of the muffler according to VW diagram - and I haven't
found it attached elsewhere!)
And the bolts holding the pipe to the bracket down there on the left are
pretty rusty.
So, before I go tearing into that - anyone know if its easier to do this
from the fan shroud side- does it come apart with the engine remaining in the
van?
And speaking of rust on the exhaust - is there anything one can do to help
maintain the pipes? Mine have some surface rust but seem pretty solid.
Would
naval jelly followed by exhaust manifold paint be worthwhile?
