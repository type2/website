&gt; I think its time to let Chyrsler know about the inaccuacy of their claims. 
&gt; It seems to me we did something similar to what I had in mind to the &quot;Car 
&gt; Talk&quot; folks a while back...
&gt; 
&gt; What I propose is this....Chrysler must have a web site, right? And I would 
&gt; suppose that somewhere in this web site is an e-mail response 
&gt; &quot;card&quot;...Wouldn't it be fun to have educate Chrysler in the errors of thir 
&gt; ways much the same as this list did to &quot;Click &amp; Clack&quot;?
No such luck. A quick search turned up a snail mail address only... 
Big surprise... Good idea though, hope someone can find it.
 
&gt; Just a &quot;before-coffee-fix&quot; thought....
