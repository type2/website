Subject:      Yokohama 356Y tires

Well my search for affordable Westy tires has turned up this...

        Yokohama Y356 tires
        185R14 light truck tire
        Load Range &quot;C&quot; 1600 lbs 50lbs max pressure
        6 ply re-enforced sidewall
        $48.00 each plus shipping from the Tire Rack 1-888-362-8473

Of course you have to add mounting and balancing to the price, but it still
seems like the new low price leader (and since I live in Reno NV where Tire Rack
has thier warehouse, no shipping charge).

Soooooo, anyone owning a set of these tires care to comment??? The price seems
to be most attractive! TIA
