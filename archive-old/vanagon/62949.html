Subject: Re: Anchor bolts in an '84 Westfalia

When I added a third seatbelt to my Westy's rear seat, I found that the
seatbelt anchors screwed into nuts that were welded to the car.  Seats are
probably the same.

&gt; In the camper the rear bench seat box frame is fixed to the body via
&gt; three shiny brass 13mm bolts.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm tempted to extract one of these bolts, insert an anchor hook that I can
&gt; tether my child's carseat to, and then reinsert the bolt.  Looking
&gt; underneath the camper I don't see any bolts coming through the floor
&gt; near where these ones go in.
&gt; 
&gt; If I remove the bolt will I be able to easily put it back in?  Or will I hear the
&gt; sound of a nut falling away into the depths and then end up with a loose
&gt; rear seat?    Will I need a longer replacement bolt (the anchor is about a
&gt; computer diskette in thickness)?
&gt; 
&gt; Your help would be appreciated.

&gt; B.T.W. - Volkswagen of Canada/America told me over the phone that
&gt; '84's were not designed for the extra tether of a Canadian carseat.  They
&gt; also would not recommend a workaround because they didn't want to be
&gt; held liable.
