&gt;And, hey, when was the last time you
&gt;had somebody on the freeway ask you to open your window to ask you if your
&gt;ride might be FOR SALE, while driving 60m's per H?  (I've actually had this
&gt;happen twice with my 60 Singlecab, and you should SEE the thing!)

I get that a lot in my '66 'Stang convertible. You should see jaws drop
when I tell them I paid $1200 for it as a junker, with a metal roof!   
:^)

SOMETHING POSITIVE... (continued)

Here's one for you... I was actually pulled over by a National Park 
Ranger - who said, and I quote:

&quot;I hope you don't mind that I stopped you, but... I just had to meet 
the lady who was driving the most beautiful bus I've ever seen! I knew 
you'd be a lady... this thing has that lady's touch! Is it for sale?&quot;

&quot;Hey! EVERYTHING is for sale... for the right price!  Twenty grand, and 
she's yours!&quot; :-)

And how about the time in the Carl's Jr. lot, when  a local town cop  
pulled up, turned on his high powered spot/search lamp, and proceeded 
to make her pearl purple paint glisten like the 4th of July... starting 
at the back and running slowly to the front, at which time he blasted 
the light in our faces - saw us, freaked, turned off the light and sped 
away into the darkness... only to return in a matter of minutes to 
apologize for his rudeness - and say: &quot;That's the most beautiful paint 
job I've ever seen... beauty, beauty, beauty!&quot; All of this, of course,  
while we sat there poking french fries down our throats! 

Good thing Blanchard and I are the original Mr and Ms Clean!!! But, 
it's still un-nerving to get pulled over by the &quot;man.&quot;  Especially in 
National Parks, and small towns, where they're just lookin' for 
something to do. And...  ya know something MUST be going on in that 
purple bus!  :-)

If you had told me 6 months ago that a pearl purple bus could cheer 
people up, I would never have believed you... but it's true!  &quot;Her 
Majesty&quot; is the bus that makes people smile! :-) 

On our first road trip, after her resto/customization, we booked it to 
Zion for a big wall climbing trip... every California, Nevada, and Utah 
road crew stopped traffic so they could check her out. We saw more 
peace signs in 2 days than we'd seen in our entire lives!

Forlorn, pissy motorists and pedestrians would cast their gaze toward 
her, and rise up smiling! Only one guy acted disgusted... and he 
actually looked staright at me and shook his head! :-(  That's when I 
wished I had gone ahead with my idea of having a little neon sign 
installed in the back window... that, with the flick of a switch, would 
light up and read: 

&quot;I DON'T CARE IT YOU DON'T LIKE IT!&quot;  

 :-)   :-)   :-)

Then there was the guy at the shop that did her face lift who said: 

&quot;Ya know, it'd be worth more if you painted it the original colors...&quot;

&quot;Worth more to whom?&quot;

&quot;Well, REAL Volkswagen freaks are into keeping things original!&quot;

&quot;Hmmm, I didn't know I could buy PRE-OXIDIZED tan and white paint!&quot;

&quot;Well...&quot;

&quot;Hey, when a lady goes in for a face lift, does she ask for the 
wrinkles to be put  IN?&quot;

&quot;Well, no!&quot;

&quot;This bus was DOG UGLY the day she rolled off the assembly line... now 
who in their right mind would put this much time and money into her - 
to just turn around and make her DOG UGLY AGAIN?&quot;

With that, he spun on his heel, and continued to grind away on the 
fender of a '95 Ford Explorer.

I was relieved to learn that his body work skills were relegated to new 
car fender benders - and not required in the  part of the shop which 
was dedicated to full filling thirty year dreams, that special part of 
the shop where they performed MAGIC!

And magic it was... dressed up in all her finery, she's like driving 
the grand ball room at the Ritz! I love it, and absolute strangers love 
it, too.

I actually had a friend come up to me at the sushi bar and ask: &quot;Kath, 
is that your mid-life crisis out there?&quot;

Mid-life crisis? How rude! Why is it... that... just when you figure 
out that it's OK to do something that pleases you, and you just so 
happen to be 46... that some people think you're going through some 
sort of crisis? I believe that creating &quot;Her Majesty&quot; was a 
celebration... not a crisis!
