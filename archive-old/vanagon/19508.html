I'm going by what a VW guy told me.  I don't know the 'truth' of the 
matter - but I never believe salesmen at 'car' dealers.

&gt;  I didn't mean to imply that the Eurovan is underpowered, certainly not
&gt;  compared to my bus - driving 2,000 miles behind Pete Sellers in his
&gt;  Eurovan proved that to me (but when I get the 2.0 installed, then we'll
&gt;  see!).  My gripes are specifically with the Rialta.  With all the extra
&gt;  weight and (what I was led to believe was) the stock engine, I doubt I
&gt;  would be very far behind it up grades.  The sewer drain pipe thing on
&gt;  the side was a mere 5 inches off the ground - liable to hit it on speed
&gt;  bumps!  The advertise it as having over 6 feet of headroom inside, but
&gt;  that is only in the entrance way - a small area about 3 feet square.
&gt;  The rest of the camper has about 5'9&quot; headroom, and I can't even come
&gt;  close to standing upright in it.

I'm gonna have to check closer.  The number of calls I get from the Winne 
dealer lead me to believe it hasn't been a real good seller for him.  
Good thing I'm a little guy.  5'9&quot; gives me easy head room.  I haven't 
driven the Rialta yet but I really didn't see the box as cramped at all.  
I suspect that your having to be hunched might have made it seem smaller 
in all ways.  I and my whole family was bouncing around in one at the 
dealer lot and saw it as plenty roomy.  Darned near palatial compared to 
the Westy I grew up in.

I still haven't met Pete and he only lives a few miles from me.  I'm gonna 
have to fix that.

&gt; Again, I wasn't trying to slam the Eurovan - just giving my impression
&gt; of the Rialta conversion.  Sorry if I offended anyone.

Not really offended.  Yours didn't sound like the completely clueless 
complaints I've heard about the EV.
