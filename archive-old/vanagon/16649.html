Subject: Volksfest last weekend

     Hi all,
     
     Well for the usually UK crew, which I met down at volksfest, they know 
     all about it, but for those who didn't make it here's what was 
     happnin'
     
     I was a bit disappointed with the size of the event this time - it was 
     a bit small and there weren't many small traders - I just love fishing 
     through boxes of junk to find them little gems. So all I cam away with 
     was a left hand fish-eye lens for 3 quid - bargain, the chrome was 
     perfect, all it needed was a bit of t-cut and it was as good as an NOS 
     one. I've got this thing about collecting fish eye lenses, I've got 
     threee spare ones now, two of which are NOS and the rest are almost as 
     good. With the last set I bought I pulled off the amber filter off the 
     back and got some orange bulbs instead - it make the indicators look 
     white/clear now.
     
     Also the drag racing was a bit tame, I prefer the awesome powers of 
     the top fuelers as apose to the street ans super street classes the 
     outlaw anglia were cool though.
     
     I met up with:
     
     Neal &amp; Jane
     Heath &amp; his mate
     Andy &amp; Anne
     
     Got wrecked with Andy and Anne and my girlfriend, Helen, on Saturday 
     night.
     
     I put my bus in the show'n'shine on the sunday and came away with 
     'Best Type II split' - not too difficult since mine was the only split 
     that entered :)
     
     soz that, heath didn't come away with any prizes, but I voted for yer 
     mate. The kemp bug is really in a class of its own, and what a paint 
     job and interior - well done Heath :)
     
     Well the next meet for me is err, next weekend, cool - Stanford Hall 
     '95 the split screen van club is going on a cruze down there they 
     wreckon the cruze gets to be over a mile long - full of splitties, 
     anyone going apart from me ??
     
     Question is will the dreaded gearbox rumble appear again ?
     
     
     Lee.
