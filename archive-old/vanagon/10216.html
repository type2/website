Subject: Re: Brazilian Bus: The Plan

well, there are sure some butthead u.s. border guards at the detroit crossing

i once made the mistake of carrying tri-coloured pasta and trail mix in my
car across the border.

The border guard had never seen tri-coloured pasta and was immediately
suspect, plus he thought that the remanants of my &quot;trail mix&quot; was a bag of
weed! Now come on you can't tell me that guy has an i.q. larger than his
shoe size! When i told him i was a university student, he wanted to know
why i wasn't carrying my homework with me!

Just one example of the countless hassles i have received from us border
guards who see a very stock 65' Westy as the ultimate drug carrying
machine. I don't even have long hair, or any peace signs on the van!

&gt;Hey, avery
&gt;
&gt;When the Custom Officials arrest your butt, can I be your lawyer?
&gt;
&gt;Jeeeeeessssuuuuuuussssss! Why does every twit (sorry) think that
&gt;the customs types at the border are stupid? Or that they have
&gt;the idea of the century to bring in  uncertified cars to the
&gt;US??
&gt;
&gt;Let me give you a quick story. You all know who Bill Gates is, right?
&gt;He has a Porsche 959 (you all remember the Porsche supercar from
&gt;the early 1980s) that is sitting in a warehouse because he
&gt;can't get it into the country legally. Here is a guy who has, what,
&gt;Billions of $$$$....and for all he's worth, he can't even buy
&gt;the access to the US for his car. So get a clue!
&gt;
&gt;Also one other thing...affixing a VIN from one car to another is a
&gt;Federal offense! Punishable by making you share a cell with a
&gt;large 300 pound male named &quot;Bull&quot;, and who will gladly refer
&gt;to you as &quot;Peaches&quot;. After you have picked up the bar of soap
&gt;in the shower a few times, you may come to realize that changing
&gt;a VIN number and assuming the Customs Officers are stupid, may
&gt;not have been a smart move.
&gt;
&gt;Ahhhh, thank you .... I feel better now.
