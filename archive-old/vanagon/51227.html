&gt;A friend of mine recently posted on the type2 list some official VW
microfiche.  I got the old bus stuff since that's my primary interest,
 however I am hoping to find a post '85 Weekender!!  He recently told me that
the watercooled Vanagon and 
&gt;EuroVan microfiche have not been sold.  If you're interested you can contact
him at:

A Radio Shack 30X magnifier (cheap) works well on this stuff...and it's lots
cheaper than buying a parts manual!!         PINK
