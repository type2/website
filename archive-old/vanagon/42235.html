&gt; I know Stephen didn't really intend for the above to go to the list, but
&gt; since it did I wanted to point out that that third screw Bentley shows is
&gt; in fact present in some busses.  It screws into a long piece of metal that
&gt; runs the length of the track.  When you loosen the screw, you then tap the
&gt; screwdriver which pushes the strip of metal to the rear.

Yah, as I said, I have never seen it, but Bentley had a picture, so at
least one bus, somewhere has it.  Probably a year that I haven't owned a
bus from.

&gt; There is ALSO a
&gt; screw or bolt toward the front end of this middle track that is only
&gt; accessible from INSIDE the bus.  Sometimes you have to remove an inside
&gt; trim panel, other times there is a cutout so you can get to it.  But what
&gt; I can't remember off hand is whether this bolt goes through the outside
&gt; trim piece or just holds on the front stop that the trim piece screws to.
&gt; (Ie. you might not have to take it off.)  This is where the manual becomes
&gt; handy.

I didn't mention this bolt (screw? I forget) as it is one of three
fastenings that holds the stop block to the body (the other two are fairly
obvious bolts) and need not be removed to get the door off.  As an aside,
I was looking at that assembly last night before I wrote the procedure and
boy is it going to be a job to get that screw out on the Westy!  Sits
right behind the side cabinet.  Ouch!
