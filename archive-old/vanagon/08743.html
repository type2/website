Subject: Thermostat Location?

Well,  

I've more or less concluded that I have two problems:

1.  An intermittent short in the circuit that includes the dash gauge 
showing engine heat.  Sometimes it's really not hot, but goes up so fast 
that a short is a likely candidate.  Sometimes it runs fine for a while 
and then rapidly moves to hot.  Sometimes it's accurate.

2. A sticking thermostat.  Once in a while the engine actually is hot.  
Why doesn't the fan run?  Well, dummy (speaking to self) because the 
water isn't hot enough to run.  How do I know it will run?  Because I 
turned on the AC and the fan did indeed run.  Why isnt' the water hot?  
Because it's the engine that's hot, but water is not circulating by the fan.

Running the fan with the engine hot doesn't bring the temp down any, either.

So, I've concluded I need to change the thermostat.

So, where is it?

Thanks (and if I'm wronge, don't tell me, just shoot me - this is too much).
