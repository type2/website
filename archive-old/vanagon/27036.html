&gt;&gt;My own thots run more along the lines of these paint guns, the things that
&gt;&gt;shoot capsule of paint.  Getting Grendel home without a rear bumper was
&gt;
&gt;For a brief time years back the service stations sold engine oil in plastic 

&gt;1 litre bags, like milk.  I _have_ seen what happens when one of those hits 

&gt;a car windshield at speed &lt;g&gt;, pitched from the rear side vent window of a
&gt;'71 Westy by my trusty tailgunner.  Amazing I made it out of my misguided
&gt;youth unharmed.


How about one of those super squirt guns kids have nowadays (with
separate air tanks even) that shoot 50 feet... filled with anything
from used oil to concentrated skunk scent? Hmmm... the possibilites
are endless.  ;)
