&gt; I recently put some of it on my Vanagon's windshield,
&gt; I thought it was cool :)  It's fun to watch the the water bead up and
&gt; run, scared, up the windshield.
&gt; It's great for me because at highway speeds, tha wipers hydroplane
&gt; across the surface of the water, not doing much more than stirring
&gt; it up a bit.
&gt; SStones             Toronto,  Ontario.
&gt; 
This is what scares me about the stuff and why I don't like
it, certainly good at low speeds and no wipers but at high
speeds and a lot of water it all just swishes around on the
windshield and never comes off, I don't like it.
