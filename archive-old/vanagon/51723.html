&gt; &gt; I was putterng aroung southern RI yesterday, and stumbled onto this.
&gt; &gt; Cream colored 82 Diesel Westy for $3000.  It has minor surface rust along
&gt; &gt; some seams, but there are NO major dents or dings thatb I noticed.The
&gt; &gt; sign proclaimed a &quot;new&quot; diesel engine and camping interior fuctional.
&gt; &gt; Everything inside seemed intact and relatively clean.  The tires were not
&gt; &gt; so hot.  It seems like a good deal...
