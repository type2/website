  Very interesting.  I'd certainly like to hear any other examples of 
especially long lived motors before their first rebuild.  My Mazda B2200 
diesel still gets nearly 40 mph at 226K miles and has used only one water 
pump and an alternator to the engine compartment.  How long have VWs 
gome?


  Also, Chris wrote &quot;PS.  If anyones interested I've found a supplier for 
really neat propane heaters that fit under the rear bench seat.  They're 
from the UK, use virtually no propane and come with a nifty little 
thermostat that you can put up on the wardrobe of a Westy.  Mine cost me 
about $500 including shipping (worth every penny up here too)!!!!!!&quot;
  Chris, please describe this in detail, especially with respect to 
venting.

  Thankz,
  John Wakefield
