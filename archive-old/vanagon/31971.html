Congradulations on your Westie!

For the fridge, a trick I learned was to &quot;rapid-fire&quot; the piezo. Just 
keep on clicking it as rapidly as possible, keep firing away until
it lights.

Mine never works on one click, but always fires up after a few
-well maybe several- seconds of the rapid-fire technique.
