&gt;    VW has made a 1.9 td for a couple of years now, and I have seen new
&gt; longblocks
&gt;    advertised for sale.  Has anybody installed this motor into a Vanagon?

Scott Foss, of Sausalito, Calif., has installed the 1.9 TD block in his
Vanagon.  He used the 1.6 TD head and injector pump, I think.  The 1.9
block is a little bit taller so he had to lower his engine and
transmission about 0.75 inches to make everything fit.  He said the block
takes a different vacuum pump drive and he had trouble getting one that
would work with his old vac. pump.  He also had trouble getting engine
sheet metal to fit.
