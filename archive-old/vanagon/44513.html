Also, clean the oil cooler out;  a car wash will do wonders on it.  I've
never had to chuck any oil coolers. Just be sure the cooling fins aren't
mashed up too much.

Are you sure?  I wouldn't risk another bearing failure on metal chips that 
only work they're way out of the cooler over time.

About the case.. There's no reason to change cases
unless the endplay (thrust bearing seat) is out so far that the case is
getting too  thin next to the flywheel.  I have a couple of cases that
are cut/worn too far like that, and I am still waiting for someone to come
up with a cure. Any ideas out there?

Read the Berg catalog.  If it's an old AS41 case, check it very closely 
before reusing it.  One way, other than looking at the bearing saddles and 
seeing if they're dented or have bearing impressions in them, is to bolt it 
together empty and shine a light through it.  If you can see any light 
through the case halves anywhere, it's shot.

I always hate to have the case cut,
but it is worth it if the bearing is at all loose in there.  You will need
oversized case bearings for that also.

I would not re-use a case if it needed a line-bore.  A new case has far 
better oil pressure.
My new engine had 20 PSI at idle when hot, with 20w oil.  No line-bored 
case can do that.
