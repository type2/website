This sounds a lot like the 86 Synchro I bought in Jan 1992. It had 84K
miles and also needed new heads. I bought this vehicle from the
original owner for $3000 and put another $4100 into. It sounds like a
lot but mechanically, it was in perfect condition after the repair.
(I'll detail what was done at the end of this response.)

&gt; &gt;86 VW Synchro
&gt; &gt;4WD, 7-pass, fact rear bed, PS&amp;PB, AC, p/mirrors, no rust, 106k mi, minor
&gt; &gt;dents, nds new heads. Runs strong. Can be heard run in Hopkinton $2500/bo
&gt; &gt;call eves (Franklin) 508-541-8393
&gt; 
&gt; I've converted from a Eurovan-wannabe to a Vanagon-wannabe and this
&gt; ad sounds like what I'm looking for.  Are all Synchro's manual transmission
&gt; (I hope its not an automatic)?

Not sure, I've never seen an automatic Synchro and the only reference
I can find in Bentley is for a 4sp Manual tranmission for a Synchro.

&gt; What size engine is this?

Should be a 2.1

&gt; What would it cost (guestimate) for new heads?

This is where it starts to get interesting. If you've been following
the list for awhile, you may have seen people being quoted
UNBELIEVABLE prices for parts. Often, Vanagon part prices are higher
than Porsche parts. That said, a complete set heads including the
valve and rocker arm assembly is $850 (remember, this is a 1992 price.)

&gt; (I have neither the time, skill, or desire to do this myself)  What would
&gt; it cost to go the extra nine yards and do a comprehensive engine rebuild,
&gt; since the engine would, presumably, already be apart?

Just because you don't have the time, skill or patience to do this
work, you still can still own this vehicle. But, before you buy this
or any other Vanagon, shop for a mechanic in your area. Find one who
has worked on them so he doens't &quot;learn&quot; on your engine. Don't be
surprised if you find someone whose hourly rate is $10 to $15 an hour
higher than what you are used to paying. If you find someone who meets
your qualifications, you won't mind paying the extra labor rate.


&gt; It would be nice to
&gt; have a completely rebuilt engine from the start.

I agree, if the heads are coming off, it makes sense to take care of
the rest of the engine at this point.

&gt; Is this a full time
&gt; 4WD?  What sort of gas mileage would it get?

Yes to full time 4WD, gas milage around town (no highway runs at all)
is 16-17MPG and on interstate traveling I get 20MPG.


&gt; I'm a not-very-mechanical vanagon-newbie (except for a '69 bus I owned a loong
&gt; time ago).  What should I look for if I go to see this vehicle?

If you are already looking at the vehicle, (and assuming you've
followed my advice to locate a mechanic :-), bring it to your machanic
and have him go through it with a fine toothed comb. If the seller
balks at this, walk away from the deal. One thing to remember is there
will always be another Vanagon to buy. Try not to get &quot;emotionally&quot;
involved in the purchase. (Easier said than done).

Another thing is to ask to see receipts for work done on the Vanagon.

If you are satisfied with your machanic's prognosis, then make your
purchase decision.

&gt; 106k sounds
&gt; like a lot of miles for a 4WD -- do the synchro's tranny hold up well?

If this is the only thing wrong with this Synchro, it means this
vehicle been maintained. The tranny should be ok if the tranny oiled
has been changed. The CV's should have had at least 1 repacking since
new. (Hopefully 3 or 4 by now). At 106K and eight years, you are
reaching the life of the orginal muffler. Recall my previous Porsche
comment when you start thinking about replacing the muffler system.

Other things that come to mind: brake system, body rust (should be
very little), coolant system, AC system. If these haven't been
maintained, they will need attention.

At this point, I'm quite happy with my Synchro. It is my daily driver
and I need all the space to carry windsurf gear for myself and my wife.

OK, if you've read this far, here's the list of work I've had done on
the Synchro. I don't have all my receipts in front of me so most items
will not have the idividual part price.
