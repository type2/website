Subject:      69 camper



This afternoon I will be going out to check on a 69 camper for sale--my wife's
idea. The plan is, if it is in good shape take our 68 &amp; 71 to make one really
good machine. My main question is, &quot;Is it possible to put the 71's disk brakes
on the 69? Also, we have not owned or used a camper before, what should I
watch for? Thanks.
