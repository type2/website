Tim,

Reminding people like me (and perhaps you?) about this tech bulletin
used to be Uncle Joel's life work, before he went on to the year and
model statistics and Friday songs ministry.   Can't say that this is the
answer to your hesitation problem, but it sure fixed my problems.  

Here's the Tech Bulletin from the handy web page (apologies 'cause I
forget who put up the page).

Dave

Also - the van tech bulletins are all at:

(Take a DEEP breath...)
