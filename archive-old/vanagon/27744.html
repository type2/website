just to add to what Joel and Jon have written...

I repalced my halogen sealed beams (which are much, much, better than the 
old incandescents) with a pair of Bosch H4s from a junkyard ($30 pr). I 
still have the 55/45 watt bulbs in them. The light pattern is &quot;cleaner&quot; 
than the sealed units and the low beam pattern is especially nice with a 
sharp cut-off. 
		 dark / dark/
		-----  ------
		light  light

sorta-like that, the forward slashes represent angled areas of light.


If only everyone had this pattern and had their beams correctly aimed.
