Subject: alloy wheels



forgot to mention that the wheels did not require any machining at
all.  i guess the spacers eliminated this problem,  as the wheels fit
flush to the brakes w/ the spacers.  btw i have a bunch of the
appropriate wheel bolts that were sent to me by mistake if anyone from
the list has use for them.
cheers
