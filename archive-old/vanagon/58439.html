	There always is ... These units were designed for the bigger

	And here I am .... ;(

&gt;  Meanwhile Ive gotten request from other listees to forward to them any
&gt; responses I receive. May I send them your reply?

	think I have caused the response to be posted to the LIST but
	yes, you may forward my response on to others.
	I've been helped by so many from this list. The opportunity to return
	the courtesy is rare and, indeed, an obligation to a 'family'.

&gt; Many Thanks (just how bad do the fasteners on the side look?)

	After-the-fact, we considered ... perhaps VELCRO-type strips may have
	worked as well, if not better.
	They could have been color-coordinated and would have been less apparent.
	They would not have required penetrating the vehicle's skin.
	(Monday-morning quarterbacking).

	There are about a dozen fasteners. The most noticeable are in the middle of
	the passenger door and rear panel (near the back hatch). Other than one
	realizes they should not be there, they could easily be ignored.

	As I mentioned before, mine have been on for about 2 years. I'm starting to
	see blistering and some rust. 8=(

Additionally, I'm realizing that VW did not do a great job on the entire paint 
surface of this vehilce. We're gonna try to live with the nuisance of all this 
through this summer and am planning to have the van placed in &quot;restoration-care&quot; 
after our big vacation. The fastners, paint problems and other minor work will be 
done then to get a 'newly-cleaned' look.
