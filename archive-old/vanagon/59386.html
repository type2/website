&gt; 
&gt; Well, Moku ('87 Vanagon GL) and I went for our first road trip this weekend
&gt; (nope, haven't had him very long) and there are a couple of things I need
&gt; your input on.
&gt; 
&gt; First question: Boy-oh-boy is it ever noisy inside! Is there any way to
&gt; better seal the doors from the outside?
&gt; 

My 87 is one of the quietest vehicles I've ever ridden in!  Most of the
time, I can't even tell that the engine is on except by looking at the
rpms!

&gt; Second question: Moku decided that he doesn't want me to know that he's had
&gt; enough gas until it squirts out all over me. Anything I can do about that,
&gt; or will I just have to second-guess it?

This is fairly common.  Best thing is just guestimate how much fuel you
need and slow down the pumping as you approach that guess.  I've gotten
it down now to where my van only occasionally spits up at me, and then
only a little.

&gt; TIA for your feedback.
