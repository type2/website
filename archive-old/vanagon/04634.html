&gt;Anyone know of a source for Solex parts other than what's contained in the
&gt;rebuild kits?  I recently rebuilt one and it was missing a spring when I took
&gt;it apart.  No one (including dealer) has the spring or even says they can
&gt;order it.  Although, I wonder what the dealer would do if they were repairing
&gt;the vehicle and needed the spring or other part of the carb.  Recommend a new
&gt;carb?  Maybe...
&gt;Doesn't make sense that you can't get individual parts for these carbs -- or
&gt;can you?  You tell me...

buy a copy of Hemmings Motor News (big thick brown cover 'magazine' at your
local Waldenbooks or Books-a-Million or some other big mall type bookstore
that carries lots and lots of automobile books ... it'll have a bunch of
suppliers of carb parts,etc. very small ads, so you'll have to look hard,
but at least the ads are sorted by car manufacturer (mostly).

also pick up a copy of Excellance magazine ... it's about porsches, but there
are several ads in there about carbs and parts. some of those people might
be able to help.

there ARE people out there, but you have to find them. most of them are in
southern california, so you'll have to find out where they advertise. if you
have a large library nearby (especially a college library), go to the
reference room and look through the telephone book yellow pages for cities
like los angeles, san francisco, etc.

hope it helps.
