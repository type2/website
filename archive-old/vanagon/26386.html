&gt; &gt;When I was a kid, our next door neighbor, Wendell, a bus guy, looked just like
&gt; &gt;St. Muir, (who actually got me into busses) gave me 2 tins of &quot;survival
&gt; &gt;biscuits&quot; dated 1956.  I actually tried some.  The most rancid stuff I ever
&gt; &gt;ate!  They came in big 5 gallon tins...
&gt; 
&gt; whoa, now! THAT was the civil defense stuff ... that crud was packed away
&gt; in schools and public buildings back in the &quot;cold war&quot; ...those biscuits and
&gt; the sugar-candy stuff was TERRIBLE!!! (we busted open a 5 gallon tin of the
&gt; stuff once :) ... i guess it was designed to make you think that radiation
&gt; poisoning was something to look forward to. :(  anyway, the army/navy/marine
&gt; stuff was MUCH better than the Civil Defense Emergency Rations.

MRE's woulda been pure LUXURY for us! 

We had to live in the LAKE, and every morning, we had to get up and CLEAN the 
lake, and then go to work in the mill for 26 hours and pay for the privelege,
and then we'd come home and our parents would kill us, slice us into little 
pieces and dance upon our graves singing halleluja.

Now ya tell that to the kids these days and the won't believe ya!

top that!
