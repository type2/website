Subject: Re: Tires



&gt;For a data point, I've had these tires (Uniroyal Laredo LT195/75 M&amp;S from
&gt;Costco) on my '82 Westy for about 20k miles now. I highly recommend
&gt;them.._dot_decent handling, fairly quiet, and seem to be wearing well. Size is
&gt;perfect, as the speedo is still dead-nuts accurate.


Another data point: About 2 months ago, I replaced my '71 Bus's
POS no-name car tires with some BFG 215/75R14's from Discount Tire.
Handling got a LOT better! I don't load this bus heavily, so I hope
to get away with not having LT's or reinforced or anything else
(don't try this at home, kids). But the amount it blows around in
a gusty wind, is a LOT less now than it was with the old (also not
LT or reinforced) car tires, which were pretty worn and VERY noisy.

A few weeks ago, there was a LONG thread on the possible reasons
for heavy-duty tires on buses, vanagons, etc. Check out the
archives--- good stuff!
