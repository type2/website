Subject: Re: drive it!

A local neurosurgeon has quite a collection of early Ferraris that he 
regularly races at vintage events.  No fear.  If he wrecks it, he can 
afford to get it fixed or buy another.  What fun!

Not totally unrelated, but I was digging through my auction stuff and 
came across both VW and Porsche Dealer Price Lists.  The Porsche book had 
listings such as &quot;arm rest  $2,200&quot; =-0    I'll keep my 'Dubs, thanks.  
(And I will drive them, uh, soon, hopefully ...)

&gt; story on the Ferrari F50. Two were delivered in Texas. One went into
&gt; a trailer immediately, the other was driven 115 (yes, 115) laps on
&gt; the local race track for the benefit of the new owner's friends in
&gt; the right seat. He then drove it home! My man!!
