Subject: This information

I am sorry for upsetting anyone on this list.  I recieved this message from
both my company and two of my close friends so please don't jump to
conclusions.  Just because I am not up on all these virus things doesn't call
for rude behavior.  Especially Ron Lussiers sending a response to my message
to all my personal friends.  I was only trying to be helpful and would
appreciate it if list memebers would act professional.
