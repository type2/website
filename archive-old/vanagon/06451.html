&gt;&gt;Mr. Joel kindly forwarded a schematic for this some time
&gt;&gt;ago, but if I get this thing going again before winter, a heater would
&gt;&gt;be very, very good....
&gt;
&gt;Do you have a copy of this? I can't find it on the archives. If you could
&gt;forward it, thanks!

send me a postal address and i'll ship you a copy of the heater diagnosis
and repair/schematic stuff that i have. it might not be exactly the same
model, but it might help.
