I don't have a little duckbill like thing at the end of the AC drain 
hoses....the hoses just end.  Am I missing something?

&gt; &gt;Thanks to those who replied to my earlier post.  All three replies 
&gt; &gt;mentioned the same thing.  I took off the vents, and looked at the 
&gt; &gt;drain hoses....both seemed to be unclogged at the ends.  So, what can I 
&gt; &gt;do next?  Is it possible that they're clogged at the point where they 
&gt; &gt;hook up to the water collecting tray?  I'm still having the problem.
&gt; &gt;It makes more sense to me that the clog is earlier in the hose than at 
&gt; &gt;the end, but maybe I'm not looking at it correctly.
&gt; 
&gt; Each clog I've seen has been at the end where the little duck-bill-like thing
&gt; prevents bugs and other stuff from crawling up into your A/C area.  It the
&gt; clog is further up the tube, I'd suggest doing a little roto-rooter job on
&gt; the tube with a bit of coat hanger wire and see if that unclogs the tube.
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck,
