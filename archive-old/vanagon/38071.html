&gt; cooling efficiency of in place systems so naturally being a wasserboxer
&gt; gambler I was keenly interested. Any thoughts and or opinions from the List?
&gt; By the way I recently replaced the gearbox fluids in my syncro (front and
&gt; back) with their MTL fluid and I feel a definite smoothing in my shifting.

I have not used Water wetter, but the hard core road racers over on the
Fordnatics seem to think it is great stuff.  As for MTL, I put it in my
Mustang's T-5 5-speed transmission (before you start yelling at me, it's
supposed to take ATF) at the recommendation of my local speed shop.  I
ran it for about 10,000 miles and was not impressed.  Last week I
drained it and put in what Ford specifies (Mercon Dexron III ATF) and it
shifts much better.  Doesn't crunch on the 1-2 shift anymore.  I suppose
it was the wrong application for MTL, so my experience may be
irrelevant.
