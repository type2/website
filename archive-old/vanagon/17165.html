Subject: Re: Syncro Ball Joint

Yes, the saga continues. Working the bugs out of my toy.
         I think the passengers side joint is going. If anyone has replaced 
one of these, how much did the part(s) cost, and what did it sound/feel like 
when worn out? It MAY be loose wheel bearings... hard to tell with the 
driveshafts dragging when I wriggle it. 
AND... how do I figure out if/which rear wheel bearings are shot? I have 
rear end noise/vibration (it's not flatulence I tell you!) on the highway at 
speed, tires are new and balanced. CVs pass usual tests, no clicking etc.  TIA.
