&gt;Any opinions/suggestions for installing cruise control on an '83 GL 
&gt;wasserpumper w/4spd manual trans?

I've installed Zemco cruise controls in several VWs including an '84 Rabbit
GTI, '81 Rabbit Diesel Pickup and my '87 Vanagon Syncro.  The last one I
bought through JCWhitney in about 1992.

Good luck,
