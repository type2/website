Or...you could get those of us in the States that have greater (and 
probably cheaper) access to Winny the part number of the seal and we'll 
get you a price (plus shipping).  Probably find a nice dealer (maybe with 
an 800 #) that you could deal direct with.  In any event, get the number 
and I'll see what I can find out.
