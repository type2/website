Subject:       ColorTune(TM) musings

There is a device 'out there' that is essentially a spark plug with a 
clear glass insulator that allows one to see the color of the 
combustion flame, whereupon one tunes the carb mixture by the color 
of the flame (blue being the desired state, yellow rich, and 
white/pinkish lean).  I have one and have used it on motorcycles but 
have never put it on the van.  Anyone have experience tuning a 
F.I. engine with one of these puppies?

If you're interested in getting one, check out the back ads in 
British cycle magazines, there always seems to be an ad in there for 
one.  Mine is a Guneson (sp?) ColorTune and i paid around $35 7 years 
ago.  they're kinda cool (i told you i was a geek) and provide a 
visual confirmation of what your other senses are telling you during 
the tuning process.
