&gt; Yep, that was me. I'd checked the wiring, the voltage stabiliser and the
&gt; sender and couldn't work it out. Even the gauge seemed to work OK when I
&gt; tested it on the bench. As a last resort I took it apart (needs a delicate
&gt; touch) and found what looked like carbon on the coil in there. I scraped it
&gt; off with a knife and it's worked fine since.

Maybe You can help me with mine then.. I replace the float on mine, 
replaced the fuel gauge and voltage stablizier, and still refuses to 
work.. but, if I take the float out of the tank and ground the top of the 
sender, I can make it work just fine.. So I figured, bad ground, right?  
So I did the same thing when it was in the tank, and still wouldn't 
work.. It would just always read full... :(

Can you help me?
