&gt; to bang our own heads alone.

Is this the new official vanagon sport?  Will  a head-banging event be 
held during GNATT?  Do we all crawl under a bus, do we stand in a circle 
and lean in fast, or just against the side of a bus?  Are there bonus points 
for synchronization?  and finally,

What is the sound of one head banging?
