Subject: Dirty Car/Wheelwell Moldings

I don't know how the rest of you find it, but I notice that I cannot 
drive my Vanagon through a puddle without dirty water getting 
splashed all over the side of the vehicle. This means that no 
matter how often I wash the car or wax it, in a short time it 
no longer looks nice.

When I go 4 wheeling my friends cars are all nice and clean with the mud
still in their wheelwells but my car is so dirty you can't lean against it.

I am wondering if any of you have found a solution to this problem. 

I notice that in Germany VW sells wheelwell moldings in three varieties, one
for the van with 16&quot; wheels, and two for the van with 14&quot; wheels (M625 it
says &quot;Reinforced Chassis (Front - And Rear Axle Springs And Breaks Steel
wheels&quot;) and also for Tristar model.

My question is, has anybody seen a Vanagon/Transporter with these wheelwell
moldings? Do they protrude out away from the body enough to cut down on the
amount of dirt that the wheels throw up onto the side of the vehicle?

In the meantime, I bought a piece of 1/3 inch thick plain black molding at an
auto parts store and stuck this on the wheel wells, but this does not seem
enough to stop the dirt getting on my van. I also installed the factory
mudflaps on both sides of the vehicle. This helps a lot, but still isn't
enough.

I remember Joel told me he once put moldings on his bus and they impeded the
operation of the sliding door, but I am aware of a little device sold in
Germany to hold the sliding door out further.

I know beestop (I think) makes wheelwell moldings in a universal model to fit
all cars, but I put these up to my vanagon and was uncertain if the look was
esthetically pleasing. 

So I am thinking back to these factory moldings and wondering if they stick
out enough to help me with my dirt problem. I priced a set at a USA dealer
who had them listed as obs. (obselete) at about $1,200 for a set. (They were
never sold in this country anywhere.) I am sure they are much cheaper in
Germany.

Any ideas.._dot_comments...?
