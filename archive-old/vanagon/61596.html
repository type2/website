Subject: Re: FS '85 Double Cab Transporter

Hi Folks,


Just read the post of a crew like mine FS for $6,700US.

Mines available for a similar offer.  Great shape, family vehicle, never a
work truck. All intact/straight inside and out, needs nothing.  It's an
autobox too! Includes a 2200lb trailer hitch, very solid.  

Van has EPA sticker for USA/California so is a legal importer.  Needs DOT
confirmation from VW to complete the paperwork.  Duty is 25% of assessed
value, we can haggle on who picks this up and on the assessed value.  Will
deliver into New England region, say Boston at max. 

This is a deal if you want a crew, just as the other listee pointed out.
Email direct for details pls.  Bye, Tim
