&gt; My son celebrates his second birthday on 03Mar... 
&gt; Whenever we get ready to go anywhere, he starts raising a FUSS, and
&gt; starts yelling `BUS! BUS! BUS, DADDY!', and will have a fit if
&gt; we don't go in the bus. I think it's because he gets to sit in the 
&gt; front passenger seat (He's still in a carseat, and the two front
&gt; seats are the only ones with seatbelts right now.) but any other
&gt; theories are invited.

Well, my 31st birthday will also be on Mar 3rd, and Alice says I do the same 
thing when she plans for us to go out in the Honda Civic.  Coincidentally, I 
also generally sit in the copilot spot since Alice gets carsick unless she 
drives.  BUS, BUS, BUS, Alice!
