&gt; My distributor is advancing way too much on my '77 Camper. A stock 
&gt; replacement would cost $150-300 (local import parts stores). A Bosch 009 
&gt; would cost $55. Bob Hoover and others have told me that the 009 doesn't 
&gt; produce a nice power curve for Bus applications, but I'm ready to waver 
&gt; considering the price differential...

I bet the reason for the price differential is that the stock
distributor has some additional stuff in it that the fuel injection
needs (I think the FI gets a signal from the distributor) and I bet the
009 doesn't have it.  Why don't you get one from the junkyard?  And are
you *sure* it's advancing too much?  Sounds  veeeery strange that that
could happen.  And if it is, perhaps you only need replace a spring or
something.
&gt; 
&gt; But here's the question: my friend Stefan (from the list) has a 009 in 
&gt; his '76 (I don't know if it's Bosch): on his distributor, cylinder 1 fires 
&gt; at a different position relative to my stock distributor!!!

So you might have to rotate the distributor in the case.  No problem
unless there isn't enough clearance.
 
&gt; Switch the plug wires???? Sure, but then I'd have to re-adjust all my 
&gt; valves...

Why?

&gt; And anyway, if #3 fires differently from #1 (as previous posts suggest),
&gt; would that mean I'd have to change the distributor shaft 180 degrees to 
&gt; match the proper camshaft position ?????

No, the previous posts were suggesting that #3 fires a little later than
the others, but that doesn't require changing your wires around.  And
you can't change your distributor shaft 180 degrees - it only goes in
one way.
 
&gt; All this, just to put in a 009 distributor???? Help!! Where does your #1 
&gt; fire on your distributor relative to the notch that fits into the 
&gt; distributor cap ???

All service manuals for your van will tell you what the proper position
of your distributor should be.  If you don't have one yet, I would
consider purchasing (in order of preference) Bentley, Haynes, or
Chilton.  Good Luck...
