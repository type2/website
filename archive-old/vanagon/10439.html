 Hello everyone I'm new to this list and I finally have a reason to send 
some mail.  I just bought a '78 bus that has been sitting for at least 2 
years.  I've already put a new fuel pump, shift coupler, engine compartment 
seal, and battery in the bus.  I had to drop the engine because the 
clutch was stuck to the flywheel, but it came right off after I gave it a 
small pry with a screwdriver.  I cleaned the flywheel, clutch, and 
pressure plate up and they work great now.  

 I do have a couple of Q's for the list since I am a virgin at working on 
the fuel injection system in these buses.

 1) What is the best book to get to find out how to work on the FI?

 2) Is the fuel pump supposed to start working when the ignition is 
    turned on or just after the engine has been turned over?

 3) Should I scrap the FI and get a carb (or two)?

 Well this is most of it for now, I need to get this bus on the road.  My 
friends are starting to think they will be driving me around forever.  I 
have a '73 Camper that I have been tinkering with forever. I plan on 
putting in all the Westy camper stuff that came out of my dad's '73. (Yes 
he has one too.  Everyone in my family has a bus or a split.) He took it 
all out because he didn't want to &quot;carry around all that weight.&quot;

 I enjoy reading all that goes on on the VANAGON list, even though my 
wife thinks I waste too much time at the computer
