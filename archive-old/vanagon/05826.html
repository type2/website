Subject: FW: '91 Westy for Sale

This drifted into my mailbox here at work. I have no info regarding the
vehicle or it's owner but I thought I'd forward it on. I'm assuming that
it's located in the Seattle area.

________________________________________________________

1991 VW Vanagon Westfalia - Pop top, stove, sink, refridgerator, 2.5 gal
propane  tank (for stove and fridge), storage, sleeps 4.

4 Speed, 2 wheel drive, peppy 2.1 litre 4 cylinder engine.
AM/FM/Cassette, Air Conditioning.
46350 miles
Well maintained, great condition.

Oh yea, the most important part, the color (if you listen to car talk) -
White.

Price: $19,999 (okay, 20 grand).

Details: Runs good, just had it gone over by our mechanic to make sure it's
in good shape (had him do a &quot;pre-purchase&quot; inspection). Gets 17-21 mpg.

This was that last Westfalia conversion done for VW (they're now done by
Winnebago, list price $31,500).

Interested, Call (206) 641-9142 and  leave a message.
