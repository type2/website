Subject:      bike carriers

sticking my nose where it ought not to be again, i ran across this in
the october issue of Motorhome:

Hide-A-Bike, Inc.    (800) 541-4453
2706 S. Willow
Fresno, CA 93725

Superior Equip. &amp; Manufacturing, Inc.    (219) 925-0152
P. O. Box 189
Auburn, IN 46706

Susie 'Q' RV Products                     (904) 423-3106
702 E. Park Avenue Unit E
Edgewater, FL 32132

Top Line Manufacturing, Inc.              (310) 633-0605
7032 Alondra Blvd.
Paramount, CA 90723

Valley Industries                         (209) 368-8881
P.O.Box 850
Lodi, CA 95241

these folks were all listed as makers and sellers of bike carriers for the
RV's. BUT! they might also make some carriers to fit vw type vehicles. it
might be worth a check. ;)
