 Say, didn't these guys have a post in r.a.vw about, oh, a month or two
ago saying that they were trying to set up some sort of on-line parts
service?  joel, you didn't respond to that post, didja?.....  Maybe &quot;Fast
Eddie&quot; is really an alien lurking in our newsgroup and he's seizing this 
temporary leadership change to strike...

I have purchased stuff from them before (used speedo/odo cluster, and some
other stuff) and they're OK; like joel said, &quot;buyer beware.&quot;

Martha, you're up towards their neck of the woods, any opinions?
