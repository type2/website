Subject: Re: Appropriateness NON-VW

I'm surprised to read sharp minds on the list implying that there is some
clear boundary between good, ecological things and bad, dirty things.
Inexcusably, we all drive fossil-fueled vehicles made from pit-mined
iron ore.  We've already decided to compromise the environment; now we're
dickering about who gets to choose how.
