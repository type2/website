&gt; Well, after a few years of driving my bus without reverse, I'm getting a 
&gt; rebuilt one.  Not because of no reverse, but because 3 of the 4 bolts 
&gt; that attach the right wheel to the spring plate had broken off.

Brad, I'm sad to hear that you are going to lose your lack of reverse!

After three years of no reverse myself, I sold my '67 last Saturday, 
and no longer have to coast out of the driveway.

 
&gt; So I wanted to see if anyone has any insight on what I should fix while 
&gt; I have the tranny out.  I plan on doing a fairly complete rebuild of the 
&gt; brake system since the rear end is in pieces anyway.  About the only 
&gt; thing I don't plan on replacing is the metal lines.  And from Thom's 
&gt; experience I'll probably replace the brake springs also.  It looks like 
&gt; I'll replace the tranny mounts also.

That sounds like it covers it all.  Remember to flush out those metal 
lines good.
