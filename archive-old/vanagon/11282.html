Subject: '72 Bus for a song

My neighbor has a white '72 7-passenger bus for sale $300.
It's white on black and a CA car.  I'm in Costa Mesa.

He bought it last year and parked it because it's motor was shot.
I think he found out after he bought it that the TypeIV motor
is not as cheap to rebuild as an 'upright'.  The old engine is
inside the vehicle, still parked in the carport.

If I hadn't put a new motor in my '73 in Dec. I'd buy it.
Right now I don't have the cash.

FWIW,
