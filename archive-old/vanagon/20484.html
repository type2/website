S*()t!

I checked the brakes again tonight, and they are dragging again, although
not nearly as much.  After I was done friday night, they didn't
drag _at_all_ so more crap must be dislodging or sumptin.

I guess I _really_ should replace the steel like that goes front to
back, but its such a distasteful chore...

Anyone done this before?

PS - check out my new web page!  I'm still working on it, though.
