I brought my new girl friend home from college.  We took her car- a
Ford Pinto.. I (joe mechanic) offered to do an oil change.  Removed the 
drain plug, only about a quart of oil came out.  &quot;She's alittle low!&quot;
Added the required amount - not checking the oil stick- about 4 Qts after.
replacing the drain plug.  Start up and head out- awful white smoke billowing
out the exhaust...  Revisit the underside of the car.. oops, I drained the
manual transmission...
