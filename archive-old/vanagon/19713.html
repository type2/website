Subject: Re: 82 rebuild advice sought

Hi there folks

I have an 82 Vanagon in desperate need of a rebuild. I dont have the time 
or knowledge to do it myself so I am seaking external advice. 

I live in Boulder CO. I have been talking to Verners VW and Wolfgang's VW 
repair. Both have quoted me around $2200 - $2500 for the rebuild. Or I 
can get one from GEX for around $1600 plus $400 core charge plus either 
place will put the GEX one in for $400. What should I do? All the places 
offer 12 months 12,000 miles.

2nd question. I really only need a valve job and new rings, one of the 
places I talked to said he would do a top-end rebuild for $1500 and the 
other guy said you are crazy to just do the top-end because the bottom 
end is going to go soon after. The van has 100,000 on it. Can you please 
give me some advice before I blow my piggy bank.

Appreciate it

Jared
