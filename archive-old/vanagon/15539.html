 It starts, idles runs fine at first.
&gt;* Drive it on freeway/highway, and get the engine warm/hot.  
&gt;* Stop at stop light.  Idles fine.
&gt;! Hit the gas pedal to take off, 90% stall, 10% barely runs.
&gt;! Now it takes 20 seconds of constant turning over, at full thorottle 
&gt;  to get it to start.  Pumping pedal does nothing.
&gt;* Barely cranks up, and runs, and then it roars to life, and you 
&gt;  are just fine, like nothing ever happened... Until the next 
&gt;  stoplight!!! 
&gt;* Drive, get engine hot.  Turn off engine.  Takes 20 seconds to re-
&gt;start it, per above description.
&gt;

Couple other things to check.....

Dwell/point gap is spec?  Close points can act very strange and can be hard
to start, but run well at highway speeds.

Gas tank finger filter clean?  Same sort of effect sometimes.

Fuel pump pushrod set-up correct?  Too much or too little will definitely
effect the pump.  Different pushrods fit different pumps.  Shim with extra
gaskets and/or grind to fit the pump you have.  Perhaps get a pressure gauge
and find out for sure.  

Using a stupid silver regulator?  Never!!!!!  Burned up two engines before I
figured out they only restrict the fuel.

Fuel line too close to the exhaust as it enters the engine compartment?
Vapor lock!  Fire hazard!

Don't start your car on fire!!!!!  No sparks and gasoline!!!

Good luck!

New to the list, but this is great!  Anybody interested in my engine
building log I'm keeping for a new 78 x 90.5 fuel injected 1971 bus?
