Subject: Spring clip pliers

To All: 

I use a pair of Craftsman spring clip pliers.  This is a forged tool, nicely
finished, that has no trouble dealing with the longing rings on crankshafts
or CV joints.  They were purchased about 1960 and were relatively expensive,
meaning they are a bargain in the long run.  

Now that Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. has taken to emulating K-mart they may not
carry quality tools any longer -- I stopped shopping at Sears when they
closed their catalog sales store here in town.  Proto and Snap-On still sell
quality tools.  

Cheap tools are no bargain.

-Bob

PS -- Just because an outfit offers to replace a tool if it breaks is no
reason to get all excited about their 'quality.'  What you want are tools
that DON'T break.  Comparison of old Craftsman tools to their modern
offerings will give you an instant education in how a good company can go
bad.
