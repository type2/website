Subject: 85 westy weekender - longish ramble/sorry

Hey all
        Just talked to a guy who is selling an 85 poptop w/out the stove,
fridge, or sink (the &quot;weekender&quot;/camper/just plain pop-top version).  It's
brown, left side just got swiped and was redone, seam sandblasted and
repainted (I could not tell, but of course am not an autobody dood).  The
passenger side seam has some surface rust and would need &quot;the treatment&quot;.
Inside was nice, no rips and not looking too worn -- sure seems empty
without all those fixtures.  I saw this at my local mechanic and did not
'pop' the 'top' but the owner says that the canvas is in excellant shape.
The heads have been replaced by my local VW mechanic, a trustworthy gent,
and runs fine -- has 115k.  It would need to be really gone over, however,
but I did not see any probs.  The guy is asking way to much cash, in my
humble opinion ($5395), and I pointed this out to him over the phone (why
not).  The price guide in the archive seemed to suggest that a camper with
the fixtures in excellant shape should go for something like $4200, I
relayed this to the owner in question, intimating that a fairer price
should be below this figure.  He did not balk, and was ready to do the
'dance', and the camper could probably be picked up in the $3000-3500 range
(providing someone does not offer more, of course.  Not out of the range of
possibilities -- lots of students living on borrowed/other folks cash here.
I may try to jump on this but am not sure of course.  Would have to sell
the 84 after the deal was done -- a heart wrenching affair -- I have a lot
of mental energy invested in that damm car.  I have really been desiring a
pop-top though.

--&gt; fair price
--&gt; anyone else interested

Thanks
Chris
