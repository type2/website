Subject: Re: where did reverse go?

&gt;&gt;Reverse is no longer one of my gear choices in my 73 bus.  I'm assuming


Try adjusting the shift lever floor mount position, loosen the two bolts, 
and slide/tap it over to one side or the other to see if you can improve 
things. It might be wear in the selector just inside the nose of the tranny, 
but you have to drop the tranny to get at it I think. Crawl under and check 
it out. If it wasn't bad before, take heart, it's probably just (hah 'just' 
he says) a linkage problem. Save $ by dropping the tranny yourself, then 
take it to a reliable VW person. or get a warrantied exchange, or junkyard 
one if desperate. Once out of the van, the nose cone can be removed readily, 
and a little rocker arm unit inside examined for wear. If it's obviously 
worn, then get a NEW one. Welding shop repairs prob. same $$ cost, not as 
good. If the reverse gear selector rod has broken off, find another tranny.
