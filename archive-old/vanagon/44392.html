Subject: Blinker Relay

Hey everyone, i just noticed that when i turn my blinker to the right it
clicks 2 times as fast as the left blinker, is my relay bad or do i have
some sort of short causing the current to go really high, really fast?  i
have an 85 GL, and thanks for any information in advance..
