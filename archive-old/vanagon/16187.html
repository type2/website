Subject: Westy tent for sale in the paper
Date: Sun, 23 Apr 1995 17:44:47 -0700 (PDT)

Hi,
	Yesterday in the paper I saw an ad for a Westfalia tent for $75.
Of course, I immediately dropped what I was doing and called about it.
It turned out to be a very young man who claimed that the ad was a misprint
and should have read $175.  I think it is more likely that someone told him
how rare Westy tents were after he sent in the ad. 
	Anyway, he said it was in great shape and that he wasn't firm on
the price, so I went and took a look.  When I got there, I found out that
&quot;great shape&quot; meant the following:

Mildew stains
1&quot; hole in floor
6&quot; of seam in roof coming unstitched
Zipper on window broken
Rubber strip that attaches the tent to the drip rail was rotten and splitting.
Tent was filthy, and wadded up against the wall of the garage, where it was
obvious his mother had been driving her car over the corner of it repeatedly.

I politely told him why I thought the tent wasn't worth $175, and he kind of
agreed, but said that he had an offer of $120, but the offerer hadn't been
over to look at the tent yet.  In my head I considered the possibility that
someone else had been told the tent was in great shape and declined to beat
the offer.  I left him my number and told him I would be happy to give him
$75 for the tent if the offer of $120 fell through.

So am I stupid?  Should I have snapped this tent up despite it's poor
condition?  Should I raise my offer to $100?  The tent is an honest-to-
goodness Westy tent, with the multi-colored door, gold metal tube frame, etc.
It's just like Jack Stafford's, except not in as nice of condition (not by
a longshot!).  What do you all think??
