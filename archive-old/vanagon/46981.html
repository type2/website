Subject: Re: Traveling Questions


&gt; In just about 2 weeks, I embark on my annual trip to the Great White 
&gt; North (Canada) for a vacation w/ my father and brother.  I have a few 
&gt; traveling questions that folks here might be able to answer.
&gt; 
&gt; 1)  As my van gets older, I become more concerned about long trips in 
&gt; it.  If anyone can let me know some reliable shops along my route in 
&gt; the event I have trouble, I'd appreciate it a lot.
&gt; 
&gt; Route:  From Dallas/ Ft Worth, I35 North all the way to Duluth, MN.  
&gt; &gt;From Duluth, I will travel to International Falls on US 53.  I am 
&gt; pretty sure that once in Ontario, I will be on my own. 

This is 2nd hand info, but the original owner of my '88 Westy (who 
drove it for 320k) had a fondness for Don Valley VW in Toronto. So 
much so, that, in his log book, he mentions a few times leaving 
repairs until he was back in Toronto... (and this was when he was 
living in Vancouver...) Most of the major repair bills are from Don 
Valley, up until a year ago.
