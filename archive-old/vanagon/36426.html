Hey Brett et al

Here's the very best way to get your bus from one place to another.
Join AAA.  Get the gold membership.  It's gonna cost you somthing like
$80 for a year, and if your vehicle(s) ever break down, it's the best
money you ever spent.

AAA Gold membership entitles you to up to 100 miles of towing at a pop.
You can request a flatbed, which is always the best way to carry your VW.

When on a trip to Canada in my Westy, I was towed 2 times in as many
days in Binghamton NY.  The bus earned the title &quot;Westfaliure,&quot; and my
AAA membership paid for itself many times over.  Incidentally, the
fault for my breakdown had been mine - hadn't tightened down the
distributor quite enough after the tune-up; it worked a bit loose after
about 3 hours, and the timing was shot, and I was not able to correct
it.  Because the points and condenser were unsalvageable after this
event.  So while I was in Canada in a rented Phord, the VW dealer in
Binghamton replaced the points and condenser (yeah, yeah, I know, but I
had neglected points and condenser in my spares kit.  arrrghh).

But enjoy your new Bus!

&gt; What is the best way to tow or generally transport a non running '73 bus
&gt; approximately 45 miles on mainly backroads.  I believe the bus is safe except
&gt; for the fact that the engine is dead.  I was recently pulled by a chain about
&gt; 15 miles in a really beat up '73 bus and didn't feel particularly safe.  Once
&gt; I rented a type of trailer that just holds the front wheels, but the deal fell
&gt; through and I wound coming home with an empty trailer.  How do these trailers
&gt; work?  Any suggestions would be helpful.  If you recommend a rental item the
&gt; approximate rental price of that item would be nice if you know it.
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Brett
&gt; 
&gt; P.S.  I'm sure my girlfriend's mother will be thrilled when I tell her I'm
&gt; going to be storing another non-working bus at her house.
