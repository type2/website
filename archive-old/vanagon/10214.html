Subject: 70 semi-camper bus for sale
Date: Thu, 19 Jan 1995 10:36:31 -0500 (EST)

The local paper had a 70 bus for sale.  Here are a few specs on it.
Has a pop top roof but no camper interior.
Bus is from oregon.
While being driven from Oregon to Ohio old engine died so a new one was put
in in Nevada.  Engine has less than 3,000 miles.  Since being in Ohio it has 
been garaged.  The add read that the bus was very solid and in excellent 
condition.  Anna the owner said she was asking 2000.  If anybody is interested 
email me and I will send you her number.  Haven't seen the bus I am just kind 
of reporting what she told me.  Oh, the bus is in Columbus Ohio
