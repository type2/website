Subject: filling oil without removing the oil cap
Date: Sun, 18 Dec 1994 01:11:59 -0700 (MST)

Here is my most recent project in my continuing battle with oil.
It seems that one of my most frequent problems with oil sprays comes from a
failure to get the oil cap on tight enough after filling oil. In addition,
your hands get pretty nasty filling oil.  For these reasons, I have constructed
a removable extension which fits into the dip stick hole and allows oil to
be filled without removing the oil filler cap.  
The details of my construction were... go to the local hobby store where
one can find many different sizes of brass thin wall tubing.  I selected
4 pieces with the smallest fitting inside my dip stick hole, and the
other 3 pieces serve as enlargement tubes.  The tubes I used are brass
and they can be soldered with rosin core solder pretty easily. You'll need
a tube cutter and some way of enlarging the ends which are cut (I used
drill bits but large phillips screw drivers probably will work just as
good).
On the outside of the largest tube, I placed a piece of rubber hose and
also found a 1 quart funnel (very important to get the 1 quart funnel!)
so that I can pour 1 quart of oil into the crankcase.

The problems which I have encountered with this are: since the
oil drains fairly slowly, you really will need to get a 1 quart funnel.
Otherwise, you probably will stop putting oil in too soon.  I also have
a bit of a problem with where to put this contraption after I use it.
Right now, I put it behind the driver's seat.  However, this set-up does
let you put oil in from those gallon jugs without so much mess and your
hands will probably stay a lot cleaner.
