Volks,
	I have made a stab at capturing some video from Martha's tape and
putting it on the web.  Unfortunately, this has not proven to be a simple
task.  There are about a thousand different settings to try, and none of
them seem to work very well.  My first effort is on the web at:

http://papaya.nosc_dot_mil/~schwarze/vw/martha_stuck.mpg

...and while this movie looked okay on the mac, it looks like the colors
are all wrong when I run it from netscape on my workstation.  Try it at
your own risk.  I will continue to try new things and hopefully I will
be able to come up with something acceptable soon.  There is a lot of great
footage on that video tape, as those of you who saw it know.

-David

p.s.  For those who may have tried to get into the ftp site, bolo.nosc_dot_mil,
today, I have been having to reboot it frequently to install new software,
and the ftp daemon has only been running sporadically.  My apologies, but it
is for a good cause!
