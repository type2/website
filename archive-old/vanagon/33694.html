Subject: 79 Bust numbers don't add up (long, arduous)

Hello all!

Lately it's been pretty cold where I live so I haven't been able to spend
much time outside underneath the bus.  Well, yesterday I braved the cold and
fired 'er up.  I haven't started it in over a month so I wasn't expecting
much.  I hooked a charger up to the battery and cranked for about 10 seconds
and Vroom!  Success!  It ran great, I just let it fast idle until it warmed
up.  Then it started to run like crap.  The idle will be stable and then it
will drop, miss, catch itself and speed back up.  It cycles like that.  If I
goose the throttle it revs up just fine.  If I hold the throttle it revs up
and then proceeds to sputter and choke.  Plus, if I put it in gear and give
it gas, it dies.

Ok, some specs (according to the sticker on the engine lid)

79 Bus, automatic, California edition w/EGR, O2 sensor, catalytic converter
Engine  #: GE054570
Chassis #: 2292125001

Reality:
The cat is still there, no O2 sensor, EGR filter is gone, EGR valve is
sealed up, and the exhaust doesn't have a place for an EGR connection.  The
distributor # is 022 905 205 S (0231 170 090) which according to RMMW is for
a 74 &amp; 76-78 California bus.  The computer I have is for a '79 non-Cali.
(039 906 021 C or CU 103X).  I also have a computer for a '78 automatic
Cali. but the bus doesn't even start when I use that one.  Could be toast, I
don't know.

I got an ignition kit from RMMW (points, condensor, cap, rotor) and my
points are right on.  I also replaced the valve cover gaskets.  I checked my
timing and it's 7ish BTDC (it really hates life if I adjust it outside
that).  The guy who had it before me said that &quot;the timing gear is stripped
so it loses timing.&quot;  Hmm.  I pulled the distributor drive gear out and it
looked fine (I used the eraser end of a pencil, I'm cheap).  I was extremely
careful when I reinstalled it but I may have turned it a tooth or two.
Quick question for anyone with a 77-79 bus -- When your bus is timed
correctly, whereabouts is the vacuum advance?  Mine is jammed right up next
to the cold-start valve.  My gut feeling is that something is wrong with
that but I have nothing to compare it against.

The above was yesterday, I didn't mail it because I wanted to check out some
more stuff.  I swapped out my temp sensor II (see Idiot Faktor post for a
complete description on this one), switched Aux. air valves, and replaced
the hose going from the air flow meter to the aux air valve.  Turned the key
and it started right up.  I mean right up.  Bam, vroom, and all that.  I let
it idle for a while and it didn't die like before.  So, I goosed the
throttle.  Killed it.  Tried to restart it but the bus would have none of
that.  (I'm using a half-thrashed battery, it usually requires a charge
before I try to start the bus.  I know, buy a battery)

I thought this was pretty positive -- I had changed a few things, it started
right up and kept running.  Then I went back to the engine to turn the
battery charger back on and wait for a recharge.
Eek!  When I changed the temp sensor, I pulled the #3 plug wire.  I didn't
replace it.  The bus was running better than it had ever run before and only
on 3 cylinders!!!  Now that I've reconnected #3 maybe I'll wait another day
and see if it runs better still.  It could happen.  So, do I have a dead
cylinder or what?  I know I need to buy a compression tester, just haven't
gotten around to it.

Sorry for the length but I don't have much time to work on the bus so I do
lots of things at one time.

---
One more day.  I reconnected the #3 plug wire and the bus started faster
than my '91 Jetta ever could.  Idled great until warm and then it started
the idle fluctuation thing although not as bad as before.  Still have the
problem holding a fast idle though.  It sort of chokes, pukes, and backfires
but stabilizes when I get off of the throttle.  Still no power when it's in
gear, though.  Oh yeah, after it gets hot it won't restart.  This is
probably due to my poor battery but maybe it's something worse???

As usual, any feedback, advice, comments, etc. are welcome and necessary!
