Subject: Re: VW's use of &quot;Beetle&quot;, &quot;Bug&quot;, etc...


&gt;&gt; Can we use the word Beetle or Bug as part of a business name? I am
&gt;&gt; dumb when it womes to this sort of stuff so please accept my ignorance 
&gt;&gt;just this once. &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt; No.  BFY in SoCal used to be &quot;Bugs For You&quot; they caught some heat from
&gt; Corporate VW and had to change the name.


There is an article in the latest newsletter from GASS (German Air Suckers 
Society) dealing with VWOA cracking down on the use of their trademarks.  
If they really did start enforcing all of the stipulations listed in the 
article, a lot of aftermarket VW specialists would have to change their 
names, to the determent of the VW aftermarket (and thus the deteriment of 
VWOA, in the long run).  According to VW, the following are not allowed in 
a company name or advertising, unless you are a VW dealer:
	&quot;VW&quot;
	&quot;Volkswagen&quot;
	&quot;Volks&quot;
	&quot;Wagen&quot;
	&quot;Bug&quot;, &quot;beetle&quot;, or any other name likely to be associated with VW
	the VW logo
	&quot;VW parts&quot;
	&quot;VW sales&quot;
	&quot;VW service&quot;
	any likeness or image of a VW car, or any name of a VW car	
	the use of any of the above, even if just in a sentence or statement, 
      if the above is in the color blue (!?!)

Seems a little ridiculous, doesn't it?  Sort of like cutting off your nose 
despite your face, especially considering that a healthy aftermarket and 
hobbiest market is a good thing for VW.
