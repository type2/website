Kathy, do you have the scoop on fishing?

&gt; 
&gt; Hey, Sista!
&gt; 
&gt; I drove down to the site yesterday to re-aquaint myself with it. The 
&gt; place really is beautiful! I'm glad you all chose to come here - it's 
&gt; kinda like hosting a huge party in my own back yard. The fall colors 
&gt; should be going off when we're down there!
&gt; 
&gt; :-)
&gt; 
&gt; I met with the &quot;Hosts&quot; Ray and Gail LeMay (the volunteers who clean the 
&gt; restrooms) and they filled me in on the do's and don't's. I took some 
&gt; notes and came up with some ideas that might make setting up camp as 
&gt; hassle free as possible. I thought you'd like to see them. I sorta 
&gt; think that everybody would benefit by reading the following, but since 
&gt; you seem to have the best handle on group communications, I'll let you 
&gt; decide whether or not to forward it to the group. Hope that's OK with 
&gt; you.
&gt; 
&gt; The Feds who manage the area are old friends of mine (ex-bosses to be 
&gt; exact) and if they are around, and have the time, they will probably 
&gt; stop by to say hi. They are really nice people but they are committed 
&gt; to protecting the resource and will roust us if we're blowing it. So... 
&gt; it might be wise for everybody to know what's expected of them. It's 
&gt; really nothing to be concerned about - since they have weekends off and 
&gt; live up in town... so they won't be crusing through our site, hovering 
&gt; over or bugging us.. The Hosts live across the street about a 1/4 mile 
&gt; and they're way old and won't have the energy to mess with us either. 
&gt; Things will be low profile, if we are low profile. I mean, ya know what 
&gt; I mean? Well, here is goes!
&gt; 
&gt; *************************************
&gt; 
&gt; PUMICE FLAT GROUP CAMPGROUND - Sites 1 - 4
&gt; 
&gt; 2 miles south of Agnew Meadows on the road to the Devils Postpile Nat. 
&gt; Monument
&gt; 
&gt; CCC CENTRAL:
&gt; 
&gt; It might be nice to have a central location where our group can sit 
&gt; around the fire and have GREAT meals. Since SITE #4 accommodates the 
&gt; most people, we might consider using it as a place to hang, as a group, 
&gt; regardless of where we all sleep. All of these sites are located on 
&gt; about 2 acres and are within very short walking distance from each 
&gt; other. My suggestion is that those of us who want to camp as close to 
&gt; the center of things as possible should park at Site #4 - where there 
&gt; is enough room for 10 vehicles. The rest of us can park and camp in the 
&gt; other sites and walk in to Site #4 to hang with the group.  Just a 
&gt; thought. :-)
&gt; 
&gt; PARKING:	
&gt; 
&gt; All parking is limited to the areas left (east) of the dirt road. There 
&gt; is no parking allowed next to the tables or fire-rings at any of these 
&gt; sites. The closest parking to the fire-ring / tables area is in Site #4 
&gt; - which is another reason that it would be a good location for CCC 
&gt; Central.
&gt; 
&gt; MAXIMUM NUMBER OF VEHICLES AND PEOPLE:
&gt; 
&gt; The maximum number of vehicles allowed in each site is *serious* 
&gt; business here on the INYO - as is the maximum number of people who are 
&gt; allowed to occupy each site. (That's why we rented the WHOLE PLACE!) We 
&gt; should endeavor to stay within the limits stated below. The Campground 
&gt; Hosts, who are across the street a 1/4 mile, are friends of mine, as 
&gt; are the Feds who manage the area, but we shouldn't expect them to let 
&gt; us get away with over crowding and infringing on the regulations. 
&gt; 
&gt; TABLES:		
&gt; 
&gt; Each site has a number of picnic tables that seat up to 8 people. All 
&gt; of them are sturdy but weathered. Table cloths might be a real plus!!! 
&gt; We may move the tables from site to site, but they are WAY heavy.  See 
&gt; &quot;Site Descriptions&quot; for table locations as of 9/9/96.
&gt; 
&gt; RESTROOMS:	
&gt; 
&gt; 2 restroom buildings
&gt; 1 with 2 private rooms at Site # 1
&gt; 1 with 4 private rooms between Sites # 3 and 4
&gt; No electrical outlets
&gt; NO FOOD TYPE TRASH ALLOWED IN RESTROOM TRASH CANS - PAPER ONLY!!!
&gt; NO PARKING ANYWHERE NEAR THE RESTROOMS!!!
&gt; 
&gt; WATER:		
&gt; 
&gt; Cold, but potable water is available at both restroom buildings.
&gt; 
&gt; BEAR PROOF FOOD STORAGE:
&gt; 
&gt; This is bear country!!! Food should NOT be left out - or the bears WILL 
&gt; GET IT! Ice chests and bags of food should be covered up and kept 
&gt; inside your closed vehicle unless you are eating it, or sitting right 
&gt; next to it!!!  We don't go anywhere without a gym teacher's whistle. 
&gt; Bears HATE the way it sounds and they will run away. These bears (Ursus 
&gt; americanus) don't want you - they want your food. Just pretend that 
&gt; you're camping in Yosemite... without the crowds! A clean campsite is a 
&gt; bearless campsite. If we have dogs, we probably won't have bears.
&gt; 
&gt; DOGS:
&gt; 
&gt; Dogs are welcome!!!  (woof)
&gt; 
&gt; But.... if the Feds show up, they will get all wiggly about dogs 
&gt; running wild. The rule on  *this*  Forest, is that if you are in a 
&gt; developed area (like our sites) dogs must be on a leash that is no 
&gt; longer than 6 feet long. If you are away from developed areas, dogs may 
&gt; run as wild as they please - as long as they are controllable by sight 
&gt; or sound. Since we are renting the whole place, the dog issue may only 
&gt; come up among ourselves, but if the Feds show up, be ready to produce a 
&gt; leash. Oh... and be ready to put Rover on it, as well.
&gt; 
&gt; HOOK-UPS:	
&gt; 
&gt; Whatareyakiddin' me? No hook - ups!!! (Sorry.)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; BEAR PROOF DUMPSTERS: 	
&gt; 
&gt; There is one bear proof dumpster in the center of camp by sites 2 &amp;3. 
&gt; All trash should be dumpsterized or burned unless, of course, we want 
&gt; visitors of the bear kind. There is no parking anywhere near the 
&gt; dumpster!
&gt; 
&gt; ALUMINUM RECYCLE BIN:
&gt; 
&gt; This can is right next to the bear proof dumpster and it is for 
&gt; aluminum cans only!
