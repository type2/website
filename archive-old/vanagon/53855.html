&gt; Today I talked to the Equus cruise control Technical Service dept.
&gt; (800-544-4124) and they were super helpful!  I talked with Gene--he has
&gt; installed the system on his 84 westy and had some detailed modifications to
&gt; make the system work.  Equus does not recommend the system for the vanagon
&gt; because of the low vacuum levels supplied by the engine.
&gt; 
&gt; The vacuum on the vanagons is not enough to run the cruise control so at a
&gt; minimum a vacuum canister with check valve needs to be installed to build up
&gt; a resevoir of vacuum to power the servo.  

The syncro comes with its own vacuum canister for switching the rear
diff lock. Vanagons with power locks also have vacuum canisters, I
believe. Could not these sources of vacuum be used to regulate the
cruise control?
