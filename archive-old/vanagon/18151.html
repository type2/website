Subject:       life w/ synthetic tranny fluid

I've had synthetic fluid in the tranny of the '87 now for about a 
month and thought i'd give a report.

First off, after making quite a mess of getting the fluid in the 
tranny [DON'T try this method:  poke a hole in the bottom of the 
quart bottle and stick your air nozzle in the hole to blow the fluid 
into the tranny.  after a successful first quart i got cocky and 
dialed the psi up to 10, blew out 1/2 quart of synthetic all over me 
and the van before i could say #$%_at_] i saw those $4.99 gear oil pumps 
at Champion Auto.  too soon old, too late smart.  i bought a pump but 
haven't used it.  It's got to be way better than original method.

Okay.  Here's what i notice:  I'm now getting 39 mpg with the van!  
oh wait, that's my rec.auto.vw response.  

The real difference:  Shifting HAS improved (no, really, i mean it).  
Before, after the van fully warmed up i would have to kinda smack the 
gearshift knob to get it out of a gear.  Not real hard, mind you, but 
it was sticky.  Now, it releases from each gear smoothly.  THAT is 
the most noticable change.  No leaks so far (fingers crossed).  Cold 
weather shifting hasn't been put to the test.  

Was it worth the hassle and $28 bucks. yes.

Best tip:  i believe it was Tim Smith that suggested making a plug 
'wrench' by using nuts jammed onto a bolt of the appropriate size.  
this tip is a lifesaver because there was not clearance for the 
standard big-arse allen wrench.  I had to weld my nuts on (ouch) the
bolt to keep them from loosening, however.  this tip came after i 
used 2 hacksaw blades to unsuccessfully try to shorten my allen 
wrench (what DO they make those out of??).  anyone want to buy a 17mm 
allen wrench that is halfway sawed thru? :)
