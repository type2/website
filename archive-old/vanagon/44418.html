Subject: Special guages


Questions: how easy would it be to put a odomitor with a trip reset on it 
in a 69 westy, does VDO sell these? And is it legal, will i need to tell 
the MVA.

Also Can I replace my oil sensor with something that will tell me actual 
preasure and tempurature? Does VDO make a guage, can I get it with a tach 
meter, or could I at least get fuel, oil preasure, oil tempurature, 
speedomitor, odomitor w/ reset, and tach all on three guages which would 
fit nicelt in my dash, that's why I want VDO.

Thanks in advance
Avram
69 westy.
