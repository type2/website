Subject: Pictures or picture source for '69 Westy requested

Hello,

Me again!  I am now knee deep into restoring the $250 Westy I got but I am
in need of some reference pictures as to what an original looked like.

Yes, I know I probably should have had these BEFORE buying it but hey we
all think with our hearts on these things!

If ANYONE could furnish me wioth some pictures of what a 1969 Westy looked
like 'factory new' -OR- a source, web page, art museum where I could go I
would appreciate it.

-Marlin
