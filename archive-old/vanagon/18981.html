Subject: FS: Incredibly mint 77 Champagne edition

This weekend while perusing the local classified adds. I saw an add for
a 77 Champagne edition bus.

I called and went to look at it. One word can be used to describe its
condition: AWESOME.

This guy is the original owner and it has 72k miles on it. I was very
impressed with its condition. The headliner, seats, rugs, dash and entire
interior look like it just came out of the factory. He said I was only 
the third person to drive it. It has the gas heater and cordoroy 
covered seats. This car was never a daily driver.

He wants $6500.

This car is not quite concours condition but it wouldn't take much to
make it concours.

Unfortunately, I forgot to bring the add with me so I don't have the number.
Email me and I'll send the number to you tonight when I get home.

Bus is located in Portsmouth RI.
