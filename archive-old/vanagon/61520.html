&gt; As far as I know, I've been informed that the Syncro comes with a snorkel
&gt; built in the right side air scoop cavity.....  supposedly up to &quot;eye level&quot;.
&gt;  (What is eye level anyway?)
&gt; 
&gt; Am I wrong?

This is my belief as well.  Both my Kombi and Doublecab have a snorkel, but
neither is visible from the outside, so pictures don't show much.  If you
peer into the rear scoop, you can see the top of the tube, and you can see
the water-trap and plumbing in the engine compartment.  The trucks route
the air intake up through the right side bed support rail to the rear of the 
cab, and then up to the louvers (which are not removable like the vans).
You can't see much -- it disappears into this square tubing support back in
the engine compartment and never really re-emerges.

Somebody in San Jose has an ex-German military doublecab from about 1976
(so it's a baywindow van) with a similar air intake arrangement, so they
were not particularly unique to syncros -- just standard there.
