Subject: Re: New life for worn out air flow meter 

&gt;
&gt;I'm the one that complained about poor idle on my '85 van. It's always
&gt;fun to go down various paths to attempt a fix:) I thought my idle
&gt;stabilizer had gone out and was in the process of trying to prove it
&gt;when I discovered the van was runing very rich. Hmmm... this was always
&gt;a symptom of a dirty resistor substrate in the air flow meter. But I
&gt;had already cleaned it to no avail. Well I took a closer look and found
&gt;that a couple spots were worn through. Yikes! These things must cost 
&gt;a zillion bucks so I wondered about alternatives. That's when I noticed
&gt;that the substrate is attached by three screws. Two on one side and one
&gt;on the other. Well I took the one screw out of the one side and was 
&gt;then able to pivot the substrate so that the wiper came in contact with 
&gt;non worn substrate. 

I am really interested in trying this process on my '85.  Any details--I
have never removed or looked inside an air flow meter before.  What does the
substrate resistor look like?  How is it cleaned?  Details, give me details!!

You know why the reason why some nights you don't have a dream?
When there's just blackness? And total silence?

Well, this is the reason:
It's because on that night you are in somebody else's dream.
And the reason you can't be in your own dream because
you're already busy in somebody else's dream.
