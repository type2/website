&gt;I'm big on carrying an extra can of gas on the roof on long trips--it's

I would too, and now since it's a habit anyway...  ;)

&gt;As for feeling worried about running out of gas on long trips, just use 
&gt;the odometer as a gauge (THAT works, right?),
odo..what?  Just kidding - yes I do that too

I'm hoping I won't have to go this far - you'll hear it here first if I have
to resort to dismemberment!  TIA, Tobin!
