Subject: Heater Box/Ball Joint/Tie Rod Questions

howdy all....

been seriously lurking lately...getting the old '74 up to par...done/had done
the following:

a) front windowshield seal (no more leaks! only minor rust, a couple bubbles)
b) right passenger side window seal
c) valves (little loose)
c) oil change
d) front end lube
c) new belt
d) inspection

three things i gotta do next:

replace passenger side ball joint
replace one tie rod
new heater boxes

how much would it cost for the ball joint? a really good vw mechanic that i've
come to know and trust and who does excellent work, said it would cost $40 just
to have them pressed in and out. how much would it be for the joint itself?
from what i understand it's something best left to someone who knows what they
are doing. true? is it something i could learn along the way?

tierod....one bent bed..need replacement. can i just replace one or should i
do both...they ain't cheep but i want to do it right.

now for the big question: heater boxes...i know i know i need new ones. mine
are rusted. but i gotta do the above first. heat is a luxury right? hhehehehe
is there anything i can do to plug up the rust holes until i can afford to
replace them? i was thinking about some kind of heat resistant material...would
that work? just wrapping it around.....any other ideas/comments/warnings?

thanks,
