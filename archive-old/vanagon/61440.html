Subject: Vanagon help!!

 Hi !  I've got a problem with my Vanagon. It is an air-cooled 1981. I love
it so getting rid of it is not an option. I live in Az. Where the temp gets
real hot. But... last night i was driving along in mild weather about 80-85
degrees. My vanagon is running way too hot. Not hot enough to make the oil
smoke from the oil filler, but hot enough. It has been running like this
since the re-build. I had a competent shop do the work. The best in town. I
paid dearly for this work that took over 2 months to finish. My only mistake
was to put amc heads from spain on the van. I could not get the german heads
for any price that was reasonable. Anyway i am rambling on.. sorry. I have
asked several sites for some advice for making it run cooler. i havent got
much of a response. I connected the oxy sensor that the mech had left
unplugged, this helped with the power. But it fluctuates in idle now. Could a
bad oxygen sensor be the culprit that makes it run so hot? I would like to
thank you in advance for answering my questions. I really would like to join
a group of vw fans here in town, Does Limbo have an Az. chapter here in phx?
