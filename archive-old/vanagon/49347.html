Subject: New front on the T4, as reported earlier.

Schponfirkle, all.

I haven't read the digests for the last couple of weeks (gasp!) so i'm not
sure if anyone has posted more info on the re-designed to the T4. I was on
to one of our friendly local VW dealers today and he confirmed that the
newly redesigned front will be on all '97 model Transporters. As it is, all
Caravelles currently have them, but there is a stock of square-fronted panel
vans that will have to clear before Motor Distributors (the Irish importer)
will have vans with the new face.

I got my first up close view of one this week, rather than a ten second
glance as the Caravelle disappears into the distance. Quite sexy, I must
say. Not as Mercedes-y as I first thought. The &quot;eyes&quot; (headlights) are
slanted a little and the bonnet (hood?) is smoother than the existing style.
(That said, the surface of the moon is smoother than the nu blu thing's
bug-smeared bonnet right now, with all the rusting stone chips ...

('91 T4 panel van, 1.9L diesel, no turbo, two seats, no carpet, no power
windows, no rear speakers, no heated rear window, no mod-cons at all. But it
works, 113,000 miles today and 15,000 miles since last service. Taking bets
on how long more to engine seizure ...)
