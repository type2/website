jar
&gt;&gt; it loose, it may need to be drilled out.

&gt;If all you're talking about is rounded corners on the hex head which is 
&gt;preventing the wrench from gripping the head properly, then drilling this 
&gt;out is your LAST resort.  Get a small cold chisel and turn out the bolt 
&gt;with that.  Start by gently tapping the chisel point into the top of the 
&gt;bolt, next to one of the hex flats.  After you have a nice &quot;bite&quot;, and 
&gt;while still tapping gently on the chisel, start sloping the end of the 
&gt;chisel such that the force of your blows is transmitted to the head in a 
&gt;counterclockwise direction.  This should turn it right out!

What about taking a hacksaw and trying to saw off edges of the nut to 
give it flat surfaces again? Or filing the edges flat again and using the 
12 mm socket to get the bolt out? Or even vice grips if you have to?
