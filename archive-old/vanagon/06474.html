RE:  Heater Schematics--I have seen diagrams of both types of VW Heaters 
in the Haynes &quot;Transporter (1600) 68-79 Manual&quot;, of course including the 
wiring schematics.

&gt; Hi, Matt.
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; 	I am thinking that I have pretty much made up my mind
&gt; &gt;just to break down and get a GEX rebuild for my bus.  Does sound
&gt; &gt;like the way to go?
&gt;  
&gt; I forget what kind you have, or where you are. I haven't used GEX; I'm in WI
&gt; and did a rebuild with parts from MOFOCO in Milw. They were very helpful. They
&gt; also have rebuilds. I haven't heard bad things about GEX.
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; ...Also, would anybody either have the goofy little
&gt; &gt;blower things you need to make the gas heater work and the temp sensing
&gt; &gt;wiring harness?
&gt;  
&gt; What kind of heater do you have? I have some older Stewart Warner parts, and am
&gt; admittedly unfamiliar with them. I saw that in Hot VW (or the other one) there
&gt; was a short article on gas heaters and a guy that fixes them. Maybe someone has
&gt; more info. But if you have an older S-W, maybe I can help you. There is also a
&gt; shop named SIG's near Wisconsin Dells. I don't have his number on me, but it
&gt; should be in the archives with the subject VW guy in WI. He has a gas heater in
&gt; a '78.
&gt;  
&gt; &gt;Mr. Joel kindly forwarded a schematic for this some time
&gt; &gt;ago, but if I get this thing going again before winter, a heater would
&gt; &gt;be very, very good....
&gt;  
&gt; Do you have a copy of this? I can't find it on the archives. If you could
&gt; forward it, thanks!
