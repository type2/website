Subject: Urgent - removal of hose from fuel injector
Date: Tue, 10 May 1994 10:11:20 -0500 (EST)

I am sitting here with a fuel injector in my hand, and my van is in a parking
lot that tows at night.

While replacing fuel lines, the line from my metal fuel distributor thingy to
my injectors 3 and 4 (I wasn't going to replace these short lines) ripped!
I pulled out injector 3 to get a better look.  I cant figure how to remove the
hose clamp.  It is a copper colored tube, maybe 3/4 inch long.  It looks
somewhat crimped at the base.

Help!

Please email directly -I receive the digests.


Thanks a bundle in advance.
