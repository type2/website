Although I can't refer you to a place that sells them, there are curved 
pipe adapters that fit from the heat exchanger to the engine compartment.  
You can then easily clamp the paper hose from the fan shroud to the end of 
these pipes, just like you would on the metal collars that fit in the 
secondary heat exchanger on a stock exhaust.

I ran a stock bug exhaust for quite a while on my 70 and 71 and of course I 
through out these adapters a friend had given me just before I decided to 
switch to a monza exhaust (dooooh!!).  Instead of looking to replace them, 
I just squooshed the paper hose to fit around the exhaust pipes and ran the 
hose straight from the heat exchanger to the fan shroud (with hose clamps 
on either end).  This probably cuts back on the flow and it's also a pain 
to replace when the hose breaks.  This method is also not good because 
those &quot;donut&quot; gaskets that fit the exhaust pipes to the heat exchangers 
tend to lead and a tear in the paper gasket can send fumes into the cabin.

Maybe someone could recommend a source for those pipe adapters...
