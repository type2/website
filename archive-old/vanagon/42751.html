Subject: RE: VIRUS ALERT

Said
 &gt;Ron 'Coyote' Lussier

&gt;Just so that no one passes this along, the letter itself is the virus. 
&gt;It's a stupid urban legend akin to &quot;Mrs. Fields' Cookies&quot;.  Stop this
&gt;garbage.
&gt;Ron
&gt;forgive my ignorance, but what is the legend of &quot;Mrs. Fields' Cookies?&quot;

I say,

THAT's what I like to see.  A discussion group starting to talk about 
IMPORTANT things, like food!!  Mrs Field's Cookies?  We can have 
real-time video, and we can have audio on-line.  What about on-line food?
