Subject: The DGF and Vanagons was Re: Diesels

The '83 Vanagon that is my daily driver fits your description of the
acceleration range compared to traffic flow and on ramps. The aspect of
modern driving that makes me crazy is the Don Garlitts factor (DGF). If I am
the first vehicle in line (the Vanagon Westy) at a red light I observe the
flowing sequence of events following the changing of the red light to green:
The head of the driver directly behind me instantly ratchets from side to
side looking over both shoulders at a high rate of speed.(like a
quadraplegic on crystal methamphetemine trying to get millions of spider
mites out of their ears.) Next, the driver's torso begins squirming around
and bobbing up and down like the spider mites migrated into their &quot;chonis&quot;.
I usually observe movement in the lip and mouth area followed by narrowing
of the eyes and compaction of the eyebrows. (weird huh?). Usually an
involutary muscular spasm forces their vehicle to the neighboring empty lane
(Vacuum? eg filling of a void?). Next, leg cramps must be the cause of the
rapid comression of the throttle pedal and the anguished facial expression
as the driver proceeds past my Vanagon. I am usually almost ready to shift
into second gear by this time.

Conversely, if I duplicate the same scenario as above but try to simulate
the Don Garlitts factor (DGF) simulateously with the driver behind me I can
usually delay the later stages of the DGF untill I am almost ready for third
gear.

The addition of any incline or introduction of a Diesel engine will multiply
the DGF expotentially and is referred to as the (DGF/IDL). The (DGF/IDL)
will include a separate issue which is the involutary muscular cramping of
the shoulder, arm, hand and fingers of the outboard side of the drivers body
in either situation. As a side note, I have also noticed both the (DGF) and
the (DGF/IDL) while driving my 36hp '57 Single Cab. 

Do y'all think this is a physiological, psychological, or mechanical phenomenon?

&gt;I'm just curious why many people are so nervous about the speed of their 
&gt;vans or buses? I live in Dallas (horrible traffic) and I am usually able 
&gt;to keep up with traffic in my 82 Westy diesel, except for those freeway 
&gt;ramps of course. But most &quot;real&quot; trucks are even slower.
&gt;
&gt;Obviously, the fellow in the 200+ hp SUV is faster, but those things 
&gt;are becoming more and more like cars anyway, so why bother? When I left 
&gt;Germany in the 80s, a 90 hp vanagon (such as we have in this country) was 
&gt;considered a really fast van. It may not be the same now but the whining 
&gt;of the press in this country about underpowered vanagons was kind of strange.
&gt;
&gt;The real problem with the diesel is that you can't really install 
&gt;air-conditioning. But that depends on where you're living. Otherwise it's 
&gt;much more economic (just think of the availability of parts for VW 
&gt;diesels). Compare the price difference between exhausts systems ... 
&gt;BTW, diesels still have a &quot;real&quot; cooler, made out of metal. Nice.
