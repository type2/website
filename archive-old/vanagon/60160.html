Subject: VW Bus Club Koblenz Homepage in English

Hi,

just recived a mail from Dirk Stiegele, webmaster of the VW Bus Club Koblenz. 
He has kindly linked on their page:

Tom Forhans WESTFALIA - Syncro - Homepage

The Westfalia Owners Website

maybe you want to cross-link:

http://home.rhein-zeitung_dot_de/~dstiegel/e/index.htm

Lots of great pictures from the longest VW Bus queue (more than 18km long), 
Europe's (maybe world's ?) greatest VW Bus meeting in 1995 (about 1300 
particpants), a previev for the planned gathering in 1998, the VW 50th 
anniversary in 2000 and some useful links.

Everything available - in English.

Have fun, 

Tom N.
