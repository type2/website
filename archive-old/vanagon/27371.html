Subject: But it's rusty!!

This noon I took Opie ('68 crew cab pickup) to get new tires.  They finally 
called my name for bay 3, and as I'm driving the 100ft across the parking 
lot, a woman jumped in her Buick, put it in reverse, backed out and hit us.  
I saw it coming at the last minute and nailed the brakes and horn, but too 
late.  She pulled forward a little and got out.  I got out and we surveyed 
the damage to the panel between the crew cab door and the pick up bed.  It 
wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.

The woman says &quot;I suppose you want my insurance information so you can have 
that fixed.&quot;

I said &quot;Yes&quot;.

She says, rather belligerently, &quot;Well that's just great!  But it's rusty!&quot;

I told her that yes, that was true but she had put a dent where there hadn't 
been one before.  She made additional comments about if I wanted her to fix 
all the dents (would be nice, but I didn't tell her) and that she figures 
that's how people get new cars from these wrecks.  She finally gave me all 
her driver's license info and told me her insurance stuff.  I asked her to 
wait a minute and I got the cheap little 35mm camera I keep in the glove box 
for times like this.  I took pics of my damage, her car with license plate, 
and her in the car.  That kinda settled things down.

I called her insurance agent and he asked what I was driving.  When I told 
him, he surprised me with a nice response, like he knew a little bit about 
old VWs.  He will fax the report to the ins. co. and they will call by 
Thursday - or I'm to call him back.

The worst part is that it appears the panic stop has caused leakage in the 
right rear brakes now, as fluid is leaking on the tire.  I told the agent 
that.  Maybe they'll cover part of that too.

Oh well.  It's not a show truck, but I still feel bad adding a dent to it.....
