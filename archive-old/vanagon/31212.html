Subject: RE: was - Vanagon rear speakers - now fa


I had my 87 ducting worked on under a recall campaign, this didn't cover the 
cracks on the evap cover.  The required parts (basically some brackets) are 
way expensive--go figure and some angle brackets should work well, as passed 
on by a service tech.  BTW does VW owner imply masochist?  I don't think the 
warranty campaign covered the evap cracks.  If you do some searching thru 
net search for VW or vanagon you should eventually be able to find a 
complete list of all the warranty campaigns for vanagons as issued by VW. 
 my browser is down currently or i'd give you the address.  I think it was 
something linked to automatrix.

|There is a recall campaign to fix falling down duct work.  I don't know
|if this include the evap assembly - can anyone comment?
|
|My evap assembly is being held up via a 2x6.  The local dealer had my

|up, got my car back and haven't had the time to try again.

| &gt;Thanks to those who reponded.  You've probably prevented a decapitation.
| &gt;Now a follow-up.  The AC cover seems to have significant cracks near the
| &gt;bolts that hold this thing up (particularly, the ones towards the sides
| &gt;of the van).  Is this at risk of falling?  Will VW fix it (for free)?
