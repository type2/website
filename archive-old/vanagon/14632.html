Subject: DIESEL VANAGON QUESTIONS

Recognising that those early 80s Vanagon Westfalia's have been politely
described as underpowered, I'm curious to know just how woeful the little
Rabbit engine is pushing all that weight:

1) How long does the engine last, or better phrased, how much shorter is
the life expectancy than in a Rabbit?

2) After the 5 minute acceleration lead-up, at what speed can the Diesel
Vanagon cruise comfortably on level highway?

3) What are people's actual experiences with mileage around town and on the
highway?

Any feedback about pros and cons particular to Diesel Westfalias would be
appreciated.
