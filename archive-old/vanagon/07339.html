&gt; 
&gt; My 84 vanagon's steering seems getting heavier. This is not good especially
&gt; I am getting older every year. I am afraid that someday I might no longer
&gt; able to handle it. I know I can add more air to the front tires which helped
&gt; when the tires were new. But my tires are almost 50kmiles old now. Too much
&gt; air might upset it and cause unwanted tire failure.
&gt; 
&gt; Is this a common problem or what? Or am I really getting too old? My 83 westy's
&gt; steering wheel is not as heavy but it has brand new tires on all four wheels.
&gt; I am planning a trip to Las Vegas during Christmas. I am worrying if I will
&gt; have the needed arm strength for the round trip.

The answer is in the tires.  You've gotten your money's worth at 50k on
those old tires.  Treat yourself to a new set of good tires.  It will make 
you want to turn figure eights in the parking lot of the Mirage.
