So Joel Walker says:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; anybody know if 75 or earlier could get a/c?  i don't recall 1971 having that
&gt; as an option, but my 1974 porsche 914 had a dealer installed vw-approved
&gt; a/c unit.

&gt; 

I had a DPC (DPD?) aftermarket one in my '74.  Didn't work though.  My brother 
also had an aftermarket one in his '76.  Don't know if the factory offered one.
I think they were dealer options.
