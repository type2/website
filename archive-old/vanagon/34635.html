So Martha says:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I think it would be good if we can decide collectively where to place
&gt;&gt; the beautiful new stickers.   That way, when passing each other in
&gt;&gt; opposing freeway lanes at 74 mpg, we'll instant recognize the other
                            ^^^^^^ ???

&gt;Uuuh.. Martha, I don't think anyone is going to be able to meet this
&gt;equirement unless they're being towed!  ;)


WHOOAA!!!!  Now, I have heard from a close source that certain folks
with an 85 vanagon camper regularly see 85-90 mph in their van.
Of course, this is only in Montana during the day!  8-D
