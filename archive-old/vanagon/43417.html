Subject: 1600 D/P Checkup? 

My '81 Vanagon is about to undergo the &quot;Vanagon Restoration from Hell&quot; 
(which means that I have too much money in it to stop now).  While it is 
down/out I need something to drive to work.  I just took a '71 Westy in 
on trade (no motor) and I have a 1600 D/P (suppose to be a new universal 
case, built by German VW Trained mechanic, 30K miles) sitting out in the 
garage.  I pulled it from a '55 Oval Sunroof (1 yr. ago) that broadsided a 
pickup at 45 mph (didn't even hit the brakes).  It is covered with a 
thin film of oil (?!).  What should I check (hopefully w/o a major 
teardown) on this motor prior to installing it in the Westy?  BTW, I am 
the &quot;Compleat Idiot&quot; that Muir refers to ...
