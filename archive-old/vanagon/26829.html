So Bob H. says:
&gt; from the alternator.  Or the fan pulley.  Or some damn thing.
&gt; But not the tranny.  When I rolled out of the motel in the pre-
&gt; dawn nearly eight hours before, THERE HAD BEEN NO NOISE.  The
&gt; tranny had been rotating but not the engine, since I didn't pop
&gt; the clutch until we were doing a few miles an hour.  The leak had
&gt; made me so sure the noise was coming from the tranny, and my own
&gt; faith in my skills made me so confident in the engine, that I
&gt; failed to interpret what Grendel had been telling me.
&gt; 
&gt; Sitting in that narrow but marvelously convenient vacant lot, I
&gt; cried.  I'm not sure why, I just couldn't help it.  Water came
&gt; out of my eyes and my chin wouldn't keep still and I was so damn
&gt; mad at myself... yet relieved, too.  It's still pretty mixed up
&gt; in my mind.  I've never let things get out of hand like that
&gt; before and it took several minutes for me to calm down, climb out
&gt; and assess the damage.

I think most of us have been in this predicament (to varying degrees)
before and have had the same reaction as you Bob.  Scratching our
heads and looking at everything but and not being able to reason and
letting panic take hold.  Especially when we're exhausted and not
thinking rationally.  Although, in the past, sometimes I didn't
even have exhaustion as an excuse, just plain stupidity I guess.  So
don't kick yourself too hard Bob.  Besides, it adds real entertainment
value and makes me feel good when I read that a real expert has these
same kind of run-ins with debuging and diagnosis. :)
