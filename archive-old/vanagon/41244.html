Subject: Greetings from Pittsburgh, PA!!!

        

Hello Gang,

Well, I started my new job at Pittsburgh, PA.  Everything, including the
'87, O.K. so far...  It used exactly about one full tank of gas on the 310
mile trip, but I must admit I got a little edgy towards the end when the
needle stuck to the E line and stayed there :-)   When I finally filled up,
I was able to stuff 15.4 gallons in the tank!!! (I guess I got 20.1 mpg)....
Did the whole trip in 5hrs 20minutes, averaging about 58.1 mph (including
two pit-stops -- without those the average was somewhat over 61 mph).

My '87 has the shining but lonely honor of being the only brick in the
parking lot here, which is something I'm working on -- I helped one of my
co-workers jump-start his car, and the '87 made a big impression on him...


Like Joel's poem says, it is packed to the gills with hopefully everything
I'll need to fix minor problems ( + campstove  &amp; coffee for the possibly
4-hr wait for the tow truck, if necessary), however, I'm hoping that just
their presence in the Vanagon will keep Mr. Murphy away :-)

I drive back to Bethlehem, PA tonight, hopefully it will be a smooth journey.

As to my new address and stuff: cseren_at_fore_dot_com, phone: 412-635-3479

I'm here in Pittsburgh, PA during weekdays, and in Bethlehem, PA weekends,
at least until the end of the school year, then the Seren clan joins me to
look for a place to live and stuff.  If any of you happen to pass by
Pittsburgh PA, give me a call, I'd be happy to play host for the v_at_l friends...

(I've been meaning to write a short intro of myself for sometime now, maybe
I'll be able to do that here in Pittsburgh, PA, so stay tuned...)

Best wishes to all...
Cetin
