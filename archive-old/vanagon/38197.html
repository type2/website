Subject: Re: fiberglass polymer/wax removal

In a message dated 96-03-21 10:48:37 EST, you write:

&gt;In ignorance I used Nu-Finish on my fiberglass pop-top.  The white haze
&gt;refused to buff.  I figured it would at lease protect, so I left it for the
&gt;winter but it never came off.  Anyone know something non-abrasive that melts
&gt;nasty polymer/wax from the uneven surface without hurting the paint?  I've
&gt;twice used a liquid from a cleaning supply store (no listed ingrediants).
&gt; It's better, but all that rubbing and hosing still has left a lot.  Simple
&gt;Green, amonia, turpentine, blowtorch, etc.?  
&gt;
&gt;I spent today at Wal-Mart trying to compare Mothers, Meguires, etc. with my
&gt;Kit carnauba wax.  I'm open to suggestions to better protect and bring out
&gt;the maroon color!

Did someone mention ignorance?

I'm not really sure how to buff an uneven surface like a camper top, but to
remove a haze of NU-FINISH from one I can suggest a product called Goof-off.
 I purchase Goof-off from my local True Value hardware store.  That's the
only place that I can find it.  It also takes off tree sap, road tar, dried
latex paint, the oxidized top layer from black plastic and rubber, and
anything even remotely associated with oil, grease, wax, etc.   It is a
serious remover and will NOT disturb automotive finishes.  I recommend a
light scrubbing in with a medium bristled cleaning brush and immediately
wiping off with a paper towel.  Then, use Zymol to protect the paint.  It
will not haze like many &quot;inferior&quot; waxes.  It may or may not take off the
oxidation, but at least it will protect which is what the paint is supposed
to do in the first place.  Warning: do not attempt to buff with rubbing
compoud an irregular surface such as a pop-top.  you will remove all of the
paint from only the top of the &quot;waves&quot; of the surface.  I speak from costly
experience.
