Subject: Re: Exact Formula for L82 Deltron

&gt;On Tue, 5 Sep 1995, John T. Croteau asked:

&gt;Would you happen to have a formula for the L87 &quot;Pearl White&quot;?  I have a 
&gt;'66 Bus that I am resotring and want to paint the top half L87.

Rusty/Jim replies:
I'm sorry all but at the moment I only have the L82. The reason is that the
Pearl is somewhat available but for some reason (beats me) the L82 is
supposedly harder to match. I will be more than willing to share all
formulas that I come across! *Share the Wealth! =)
Peace All,
