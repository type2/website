Jeff (SenseMedia) outlines membership to Y.A.W.N. :

&gt; I'm starting a new user group: Y.A.W.N.--yuppies against waving
&gt;needlessly--our time has come. To be a member you must pass the following
&gt;simple test:

&gt;1. own a Eurovan
&gt;2. wish you owned a Eurovan
&gt;-or any two of the following-
&gt;3. refuse to drink coffee unless it's expensive
&gt;4. know what a &quot;grande&quot; is
&gt;5. own a cell phone
&gt;6. believe that mall-walking is an under-appreciated form of exercise
&gt;
&gt;It's the dawn of a new age. Won't you come y..aw.n. with me?
&gt;
&gt;Jeff

Ahem, OK, I'll give this a shot, even though it's not Friday yet...
Re: your points above:

1.  Yes, I own a Eurovan
2.  I occaisionally wish I owned a VR6 Eurovan
3.  I try not to drink coffee
4.  hmm, &quot;grande&quot;, ain't he that guy from Iowa elected to the US House?
5.  A cell phone... is that the one I use to call Ric after I've been
arrested?
6.  yes!  mall walking IS an under-appreciated exercise.  YOU try doing
     it with a couple of kids running amok!!

So let's see, I score 2 for 2 on the first couple points, and the only one
that I'm certain of on the last four is #6, so like, am I in?  Where do I
sign up?

Perhaps I'm closer to Bathtub Scum¨, rather than Yuppie Scum...

BTW, I'm going to amputate my arms so I won't have to wave 
needlessly...

'93 Euroscum, I mean, van.
