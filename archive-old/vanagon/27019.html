Subject: Tailgators

To All:

Regarding tailgators.  The early beetle rear bumper would bend and block the
engine hatch if it received more than a moderate tap.  At that time all VW
dealers had a locally fabricated tool that was nothing more than a long lever
with a specially shaped fulcrum and padded pressure point, used for
straightening the rear bumper so we could do maintenance on the engine.

The dealer in Hayward, California reporting finding one customer's bug
equipped with a spring-loaded affair that would slam down on the hood of any
vehicle incautious enough to so much as touch the bug's rear bumper,
inflicting an heroic dent on the tailgator.  The dealer was afraid to service
the vehicle with it installed.

My own thots run more along the lines of these paint guns, the things that
shoot capsule of paint.  Getting Grendel home without a rear bumper was
definitely a nail-biter since some people would approach to within inches
before backing off, as if to urge me to go faster.  An RV towing a boat
swirved so close they bashed the aluminum air scoop over Grendel's
driver-side louvers.  The scoop is no more than three inches deep.  Shooting
such idiots, even with a blob of paint, would be a public service.  Being
able to identify incautious drivers by the smear of purple or yellow paint
might become a new trend.
