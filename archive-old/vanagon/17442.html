Subject: Re: Q on 84 vanagon

&gt;rust 1200 obo.  Well it sounds to good to be true.  Probally a miss print, but 
&gt;&gt;as soon as I get a hold of the owner I will know.  I am an aircooled person 
&gt;&gt;and don't know much about these waterpumpers.  Any suggestions on 
questions to 
&gt;&gt;ask the owner about certain problems it might have.  Are the rust areas in 
the 
&gt;&gt;same place and older buses.  I know it says no rust but in Ohio I think 
that is
&gt;&gt;har d to believe.  Any info appreciated.
&gt;&gt;Thanks
&gt;&gt;Brad


Only one word for this : SOLD, buy/hold it over the phone. Rust on vanagons 
starts in the seams between the body panels, expect some. They don't rust 
out elsewhere like the older breadloafs, better ventilation into the body 
cavities. Check under the battery, inside and out, look for cracked 
undercoating/rust. 
         My '85 is/was solid as a rock, driven in high salt area for 4 
years, every winter for 9 years.  The old head gasket question, Does it 
leak? should be asked. New water pump? Exhaust OK? or $$$ needed.  Clutch 
age? Let me know if it's really $1,200 and looks really good (and you don't 
want it). I can afford a ticket to Ohio and customs duty on it. I suspect 
the price is $4,200.00 however.  There is one here for $5,900Cdn, about 
$4,200 US. It's very seam rusty.   tim s.
