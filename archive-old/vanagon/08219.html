&gt; Joel replies to Evan ; 
&gt; just a question: have you considered maybe just replacing the engine with a
&gt; later 78-79 engine, that already has the hydraulic lifters (and is a tiny
&gt; bit bigger in size)? :)
&gt; 

  Careful here, I think that while both engines would &quot;fit&quot;, the '79 will
  have the &quot;square&quot; exhaust ports that use a normal kind of exhaust gasket
  and the '78 will have &quot;roundish&quot; exhaust ports that use that little copper
  ring up inside the port (like the '76). If getting an engine from a '79,
  make sure to get the entire exhaust system with it.
