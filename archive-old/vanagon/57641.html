Date: Wed, 26 Mar 1997 10:22:20 -0500 (EST)

I posted a message yesterday that a friend has two 76' westies
for sale  here is more info:
#1:
Orange with some patch spots, needs new paint
body solid, new engine, interior in decent shape
$2100
#2
Orange, nice shape, clean body
interior very clean, all stove parts etc intact, but unused for
a long time.  many new parts inc. clutch 
the engine is strong.  I have driven this one, not the other
one, and it drives well.

the man to get in touch with is Anse Clinard
Anselm_at_comet_dot_net

thanks for all the responses, now send them to Anse.
