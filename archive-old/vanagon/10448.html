So DerekDrew_at_aol_dot_com says:
&gt; I could hardly speak and I was composing the message I would write to the
&gt; list asking for help in my head. I had something in mind about how rational
&gt; you can be when reading an e-mail reader in the comfort of your home/office
&gt; and how your mind goes south when confronted with a real problem. 
&gt; 
Yeah, I can relate to this.  When something goes wrong on the road, my mind
starts racing and I even get panicky sometimes, but after a while the 
rationalization (usually) comes through cause I'm stuck anyway so there's
plenty of time to think of the alternatives.

Regarding your particular hesitation problem, I vote for the bad gas 
theory myself.
