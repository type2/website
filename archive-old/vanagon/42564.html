&gt;Help!  My odometer is frozen.  I think it is related to the trip meter

&gt;2/10ths.
&gt;Can someone share your experiences about fixing this problem or replacing
&gt;the unit.  Junk yard? Rebuilt? If you have to replace the unit, can I swap
&gt;for a tach unit also? (Mine has an analog clock).

Bill -

We've got NOS 100MPH speedos with trip odometers we bought about a year ago
for 82-91 Vanagons at a decent price.  The dealer still gets about $261.00
for these things, which is nauseous at best.  We get $120.00 outright or
$90.00 in exchange for your bad speedo, which we send to VDO to get rebuilt.
 Ask for P/N 251-957-057BF and don't forget the V_at_L 10% discount (that means
they cost ya $81.00 exchange plus $35.00 until ya return the old one).
 Remember, these are brand new units, not rebuilts and they're zero miles on
the clock.  Call 1-800-792-BOYS (2697).  Hope this helps - I really wish I
had the gears, 'cause I'd offer to sell ya one.  Wish I had a tach for myself
too.
