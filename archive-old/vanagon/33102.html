 I made the first test drive of my 73 super bug, after a long 
overhaul. While I'm driving, I felt something wobling. By looking to 
the side mirror I knew that I forgot to torque it right. Boom! one 
tire lied on the road, the three-wheel bug was draged to stop on the 
side walk, nobody's hurt but the road pavement.
