&gt; So what timing did you finally come up with?

I have it _at_ 32 degrees BTDC _at_ 2500rpm. Does this sound right to people
with Weber-009 setup? Also, a novice question... does point setting
change from the 50deg dwell stated per Muir or is it independent of
the carburator setup?? I'm assuming it remains _at_ 50deg...

Thanks,
