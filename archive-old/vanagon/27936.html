Subject:        Hi,

Just caught you address off of the vanagon list, I am having a hard 
 time posting to it right now, so I thought I would give you a try.

I am selling my 71 westy (hardtop) and need to find a good home. It is 
 mechanicaly great with rebuilt front brakes 25K on the motor Etc. It 
 was repainted 3 years ago and still looks good, but there is some rust 
 raising its ugly head. The interior is complete and looks very good, 
 the best I have seen in comparable campers.

I am asking $2650

If you have any buddys looking for a good ride send them and there cash to me. 
 Thanks
