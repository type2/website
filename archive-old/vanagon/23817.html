Subject: Seat Removal-Vanagon Parts!
Date: Wed, 30 Aug 1995 10:36:55 -0400 (EDT)


I've just come across an 85 vanagon re-purchased for salvage by the owner after
it was left-rear-ended. The engine and a/c compressor are spoken for already,
as are the front seats. Other parts are available, and the owner is anxious to 
part out (though s+h would have to be worked out with her....) The van was in 
really good shape.

Questions:

1) I removed the front seats by removing the metal tab that serves as a &quot;stop&quot;
   on the left side seat rail, then sliding the seats forward. These seats will
   replace those on my '81 westie - is there a way of removing the seats in the
   westie whereby I don't need to remove the metal tabs? The westie seats 
   swivel whereas the replacement seats did not - although I believe the 
   mounting tracks are identical. Any tips/procedures on removal would be 
   appreciated greatly.

2) This one is a bit tougher - I've also obtained the tachometer-fuel-temp 
   gauge from the '85 (wiring &quot;harness&quot; intact) and am interested in installing
   at least the tach and fuel gauge in my 81. The 81 is the base model, and 
   just has a fuel gauge and unused clock space in the binnacle. As a bonus,
   any thoughts on hooking up the temp gauge (okay it means transfer from water
   to air-cooled)?  Has anybody attempted any of what I'm suggesting? After 
   just completing an approx. 2000K trip in the westie, it would be nice to
   monitor engine temp accurately, and I am used to looking at a tach. Help
   please!!!!

3) I think this may be a Martha question, maybe more general - I seem to 
   remember a  threat a while back about using a second dash instrument cover
   mounted to the right of the instrument pod, above the ashtray area, as a 
   binnacle to hold various items. Has anybody actually attempted this? Any 
  plans available for configuring the inside of the bin?

The 85 Vanagon parts car is located in Columbus, Ohio, near the Ohio State 
University campus. The owner-partsmeister is a very nice young woman named 
Jessica. Her phone # is 614-291-7571. Please attempt to call her directly on 
parts availability, although I would be willing to coordinate things a bit if 
you cannot contact her by phone (she's moving soon). Very nice pieces are still
available - balance of the interior in nice shape, perfect sliding door (sort 
of a champaigne (sp?) colour, glass, with exception of rear deck and left rear 
quarter are perfect, etc.

Thanks in Advance for getting back to me on the various installation questions.
