Subject: '56 Kombi Starting Problem Fixed?

(*sigh*)

Remember the starting problem I had?  Every other day I thought I 
had it fixed.  First I tightened everything up, then I replaced
the battery, then last weekend I replaced the starter, today another
battery and new cables.

All for nuttin'!

I finally broke down, got a new starter bushing, pulled the motor and put
the puppy in.  Now I think its fixed.  The old bushing was thrashed, worn
right thru in spots!

Interestingly enuf, the new starter also had a major problem: someone had
machined it down to fit a 12V bushing, which is narrower.  It just flopped
like a dead duck in the new bushing!  I ended up using the old starter,
which I kept (and sent in an old 914 starter as a core) so now I get to
take it back on warranty, and have a new one on ice.  I think I''l get another
new bushing and replace both the bushing and starter again, so they'll both be 
new; this old starter has some good groves on it from the thrashed bushing,
which will probaly have me doing it all again in a few months anyway.
