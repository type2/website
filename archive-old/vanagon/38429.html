Subject: Re: ignition switch removal 75-79


paul, i just did this task last saturday.  it is not hard, although the 
bently manual makes it look that way.  basically, you need to remove the 
steering wheel.  after that, getup underneath the plastic cover and 
remove the 2 philips screw's that hold the cover down.  Now get yourself 
a easy-out and take out the shear bolt that holds the ignition on the 
collumn.  mine cane out with out much trouble.  now you can lift the unit 
off.  i did not have to disconnect the water lines when i did mine.  i 
have yet to put it back together, but imagin that it will not be too bad.

hope this helps.

take care and God Bless
matt

&gt; Hey folks, 
&gt; Anyone have first hand knowledge on the removal of the ignition switch
&gt; on a 75-79 bus??  From looking at the Haynes manual, this looks like an
&gt; awful project.
&gt; 
&gt; thanks,
