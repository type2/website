Subject: [f] Question (fwd)

James Brill would like advice about getting a WWW connection going. Could 
those of you who are knowledgable and have a few minutes please send him 
a note at jbrill_at_unlinfo.unl_dot_edu?

He'd really appreciate it, and it would allow him better access to 
information about VW vehicles.

Thanks.
