Subject: RE: Diesels


&gt;Does anyone out there have a diesel vanagon/westy. Was wondering what 
people
&gt;thought of these. What was the first and last year that these were produced
&gt;and what are their particular strengths adn weaknesses.


Well, for those who feel their regular vanagons and busses have way
too much power, the diesel should be just right!   :)
