We bought a Thetford (can't see it right now so I forget the model)
actually because of info we saw here a year ago.  (maybe 1.5 years).
We've only used it once but I was looking for one that didn't appear
flimsy (many do).  I am 6'4&quot; and weigh 225 lbs so this was one of
the primary concerns.  One thing is the HORRIBLE reeking of many of the
treatments.  Be careful sniffing as many are heavily laden with
formaldehyde.  We never smelled sewage but did smell the treatment (esp
in city driving or when the van was left in the sun with windows
rolled up while we were away.  We got ours at Camping World.  They
typically run sales on them.

I'm thinking of buying a porta-potti for the old westy!  I was wondering
what those of you who have one think of them (especially, Inuvik
veterans who had to live with them for 3+ weeks)???  Do they smell up the
van?  Are they easy to operate?  Are they worth the space?

Besides that I was wondering if there are any specific models/brands that
people are happy with.

Thanks,

John Brown
