&gt;5 cylinder Vanagon jeesh.


There is a slight possibility that I could be wrong, but while i was home in 
winter, I saw a blue 1990 volkswagen vanagon, with strange &quot;ground effects&quot;, 
the front bumper had a european liscence plate shape inbedded in it.  ok so 
i open the rear gate and pop the hatch and look in and poke around and check 
if i can access the sparkplugs, etc...and i look at the distributor cap and 
there's six plugs coming off of it and i ask how many cylinders it has and 
im told its a five cylinder.  and i was surprised but it was true, it was 
explained to me and everything.  (I was also told it was air cooled, but 
that's real strange...)  so, call a dealership.  And like i said, i could be 
wrong, but im not making this up, and im not purpously stirring up the 
hostilities..
