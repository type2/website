Subject:      Ohio info needed

Dear Volk's in Ohio,

How's the leaves right now.  We're getting ready to drive back to Cleveland
for a fall home-coming; maybe we're too early?  Think we'll drive through
Binghamton, NY this trip.  We'll take I-80 back home detouring south by way
of North Carolina.

Maine's colors are great in the north and improving in the south...another
four days and the Maine Turnpike leaves should be perfect.  Red maples are
really pretty now.

Any EVC info on the furnace?  Can I run the thing thru the night and still
have a charge on the house battery?  I've heard that the furnace draws it
down too fast.
