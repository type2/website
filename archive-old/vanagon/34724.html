Subject: Re: Wannabus?  Found a '71 for ya.

&gt; All right you lurkers, this may be your lucky day!
&gt; There's a guy in town that has a '71 for sale that
&gt; I looked over at lunch today and it's tempting.
&gt; 
&gt; California car, panel van, walk-thru, with 2 sliding
&gt; doors.  All original except for the burgundy paint
&gt; from the &quot;waist&quot; down and what looks like '74 front
&gt; bucket seats with the headrests.  $2,500 obo.
&gt; Motor looks sanitary, has 180K miles on the clock.
&gt; 
&gt; I've been keeping an eye out for a nice '71 for a
&gt; fellow list member.  They bought one a week ago and
&gt; I come across this one in the newspaper ads just
&gt; yesterday.

WOW!   You've been reading my mind! 

I'll  e-mail you for details.

              were piled together on the floor)
