Subject: damaged pistons/liners

Hi all,

In doing the heads and (sorta) top-end overhaul on my 85 vanagon, I pulled the
pistons and cylinders to find nicks on the pistons and on the end of the
cylinders with the cut-out section.  I don't know what caused this.  I'm told I
can't possibly re-use these pistons.  Has anyone had a similar experience? 
Could I possibly reuse the same cylinders, or will they just damage new
pistons?

Also, I had planned to replace the main rod bearings, as there is a bit of
side-to-side play in the rods (could this have damaged the pistons/cylinders?),
but a friend tells me you can't just slap on new bearings -- that they have to
be reamed to fit the crank.  Any thoughts?

Any help appreciated, as I'm getting panicky and considering abandoning the
project!  

David
