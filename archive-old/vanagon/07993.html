Ahhh, when you stopped in Newton for coffee Mike,
depending on which exit you got off of, drove right
by the now snow covered Bus of mine.  I do
distinctly remember thinking today
&quot;Damn, I really need a gas heater when I fix my bus&quot;
 
I made the rather long and exteremely cold trip
to Iowa City several times last year, each time
arriving with numb feet.  And to think, my heater
boxes are in good shape.....

Maybe we should rank how harcore bus owners are by
the average temperature?  Canada&gt;Minnesota&gt;Iowa ;)
