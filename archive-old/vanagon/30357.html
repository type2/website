&gt; I thought you meant the headlights!
&gt; 
&gt; Now that I know you mean the idiot lights, I can say that this is perfectly 
&gt; normal.  The alternator doesn't self excite from residual magnetism till 
&gt; about 1000 rpm or so.  So, the idiot lights light until you exceed that rpm 
&gt; once.  Not to worry.

I should have been more specific about the &quot;lights&quot;.

Is this normal for all idiot lights or just the O2 and alternator 
lights. The oil pressure light didn't stay on while these
2 were lit. Also, if this is normal, why hasn't it happenned on
any occasion prior to yesterday?

Most consensus is that this is not a major problem, but I'd
like to make sure.
