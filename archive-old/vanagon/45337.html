Subject: 73 bus / timing question...

Hi All,
  While adjusting the timing the other day I made a discovery I want to toss
out to y'all: It's an 1800cc\twin carbs engine, stock everything. Timing
according to manual is 10 deg. ATDC. That's the way I had it set until now.
I noticed though that it idles faster if I advance the timing a bit. So just
for the fun of it, I set the timing to 0 deg., and took it for a testdrive.
WHAT I NOTICED WAS THAT IT HAD A LOT MORE POWER THAT WAY. And I didn't
notice any knocking or overheating (I do have an oil temp gauge). To make a
short story long: I got scared I might screw up something anyways, and set
the timing back to factory specs at 10 deg. ATDC. So my question to the
list:
  Should I leave it at 10 deg. ATDC although it runs significantly better at
0 deg.??? Or is it okay to advance the timing a bit if it doesn't knock???
  I can't make up my mind...any help???
Best,
                        Gregor
