&gt;Driving a type 2 in the winter can be quite uncomfortable. Some days, I even
&gt;had snow freeze on my windshield while I was driving. It seems that by the

Here is my generic answer for checking out the heating system for air-cooled
VWs:

First, I want to state up-front that I live in a fairly mild climate
compared to the North-Eastern U.S. and (God forbid) Canada (Brrrrr!).
;)  Anyway, from what I've heard and discussed with people and my
own experience, it seems that heating up a bus does take quite a
bit of time, ESPECIALLY, if your heating system is not in proper
working order AND if your window and door seals AND air vent seals
are not sealing out air completely.

 *** Some people feel that some ventilation promotes better heating.
 *** I don't know for sure on this one.

Let me clarify what I mean by a working heating system first.
If the thermostat and hook-up is disconnected or not adjusted or
the thermostat is not functioning properly, then the baffles that
control the amount of fresh air to the engine are probably wide open
and you will not heat up your engine properly and will not have heat as 
soon as you would if it were working correctly.  Nor will you engine
maintain a proper operating temperature.  This will shorten the life of
the engine as well as lower the optimum amount of heat that could be 
used for warming up the cabin.  I will not go into detail about the 
system, you should refer to a later version of the Idiot book (How To
Keep Your VW Alive! by John Muir) for air-cooled VW's and the 
appropriate Bently manual.  

Next, it is important to make sure that the warm air hoses from the 
fan housing to the heat exchangers (H.E.) are hooked up and sealed real 
tight.  

I think one of the weakest links in this system is typically the H.E. 
because most of the buses are fairly old and most of the used ones you 
buy are worn out and are leaking exhaust into the outer cavity of the 
H.E.  So, most people just leave them off or plugged and live without 
them. (No pun intended).  I think next to brakes and a tune-up, the 
purchase of new or rebuilt H.E. is probably one of the best investments 
you can make for a VW.  Especially if you plan to keep it for a while.  
Even if you sell it sooner, I think these days, you can make the new 
H.E.'s a good selling point.  

The next section is the junction box on the front (front is front) of 
the H.E.'s.  Like all the rest of the system, it is crucial for these 
to be working properly and it would be a good investment to repair or 
replace them so that you don't loose much needed heated air.  

The hoses from the junction box to the car body are also a crucial area.  
Make sure that they are sealed well and that there is no chance for any 
heated air to escape.  The Idiot Book covers the connections to the 
junction boxes and how to adjust them.  

While I'm on the topic of heater controls, I just want to say
that you should not turn on the heater until the car (water or
air cooled) engine is fully warmed up.  I see people all the time 
turning on there heaters when they first start their cars and always 
get frozen before any heat comes out.  This is not only a waste of 
time and discomfort, but it also takes away much needed heat for 
the engine.  I would imagine in a cold climate that this is murder 
on the engine (excessive wear and tear) and as most car people know, 
start up is the most damaging part of an engines life and that it is 
important to get the engine up to it's proper operating temperature 
ASAP.  

Another, overlooked area is the battery and ignition system.  
Especially the integrity of the wires and the misc. electrical
connections.  On the older cars, they become brittle and corroded
such that the connections are not as solid as they used to be. So
the car starts missing, lights are dimmer, and things just don't
seem to work like they should.  Make sure that all of your wiring
is in good order and that there is good continuity between con-
nections.  A bad battery cable can keep your battery from fully
charging and/or keep your start from turning the engine.  Make
sure it is in good condition.  They're cheap.  Do a tune-up on the
car and replace the spark-plugs, points, condenser, cap and rotor
and plug wires if necessary.  Don't try to make them last forever!
Especially in cold weather.

If your door and window seals have had it, then you should replace
them if keeping the car heated is an issue.  Otherwise, you are 
going to loose precious heated air, especially at higher speeds
as it is literally being sucked out of the car.  You can get 
these seals from an aftermarket company listed in any VW rag.

Check the air ventilation box too make sure that the flaps are
sealing when they close.  It's a bear to get too, but again, if
it's cold where you live, then it's worth it.

The stock VW system works well when it is proper working order
and all your door/window/vent seals are working.  Most people
pay $500 - $1000 for a VW and expect all this stuff to work.
I think they're really comparing it to something that costs
twice as much and more than you will ever pay to restore a
VW to proper working order.
