I failed to mention that my 02 sensor is &quot;new&quot; , It has been in for almost a
month and it has that carbon deposit on it already. I unhooked it and it ran
ok but not great. the power was not there when I needed it to be. I hooked it
back up and I think that there is an improvement if I leave it connected.
Could it be anything else? I think it is about time I start putting some
serious money into this thing. I feel like i have put too much already.
$3,000 is too much money to spend on a complete overhaul and rebuild and have
it not running right! I really wish there was someone in town that could look
at my van and had the proper equipment!
