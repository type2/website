&gt;In reference to window tinting, any advice on where to buy material,
&gt;measure correct dimensions, cut and apply the stuff?  Most places

i've use Gila brand from K-mart on three buses, with good success. it's
about $10 per roll, and you'll need at least three (3) rolls. what i have
found to work best for squeegee are those yellow plastic body-putty spreaders
that you can also buy at k-mart or walmart or FLAPS or body shop supply. they
are vinyl plastic (so are soft and don't scratch).

i've always just followed the directions that come with the Gila stuff:
cut the tint, using the OUTSIDE of the window as the pattern. it helps to
have another set of hands and NO wind, but it can be done single-handed.
get one of those Windex spray bottles to use, dump the windex or whatever
(you want one that can spray a fine mist), wash it well, and fill with water
and add just three or four DROPS of liquid dishwasher detergent (it acts as
a water-wetter/thinner). don't overdo this detergent stuff.

there are at least TWO different darknesses at k-mart: 70 percent and 90
percent. the 70 works well, and is not tooooo dark. the 90 has a metal film
in it, and will block radar signals ... so your radar detector won't work. ;)

&gt;is the best way to prep(clean) the glass and it tint applied to the
&gt;indis  (inside) probably, or outside of the surface?  Anyone out there

most any good non-residue-leaving glass cleaner. i use the spray can 3M stuff,
but windex will work just as well. just clean the glass very carefully ...
on all BUT the rear hatch glass, you can also scrape the glass clean with a
single-edge razor blade. do NOT do this on the rear window. it's too risky.

if you work slowly and carefully, you CAN do this, but the first time you
do it, it will take about six (6) hours ... mostly thinking, looking,
thinking, re-reading the directions, looking, cleaning, etc.

also helps to have warm weather ... so the water will dry up quicker. the
'trick' is cleaning the glass well, and squeegeeing the water out from under
the tint. ALL the water. when you think you'd got it all, do it again. and
again. otherwise you will have bubbles.
