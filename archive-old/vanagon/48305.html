Subject: camping around Boston or NYC?

Volks-
	I'm wondering if anyone can help me out.  I'm planning on riding my 
bike 300 miles from Boston to NYC in the Boston to New York AIDS ride in a 
few weeks and have NO idea how I'm going to get to Boston and back.  The 
thought just struck me to maybe try to make a week-long camping trip out of 
it (although it'll be kinda boring since my girlfriend isn't coming along).  
So what I'm wondering is this: does anyone know of any good campgrounds near 
Boston or New York that I could use as a homebase for some sightseeing jaunts 
into one or both or the cities.  maybe something close to a commuter line so 
I could make daytrips into the city without my van?  Or, does anyone live in 
Boston that would let me park my van in their driveway while I ride my bike 
to NY?  Or would I be smarter to make a trip to Martha's Vinyard or 
something?  I'll be leaving Roanoke, VA on Saturday, August 31 and I don't 
have to be in Boston until the morning of the 4th (the ride lasts until 
Sunday the 8th).  Any suggestions?  Any empty driveways in the Boston area?

thanks,

Ian
