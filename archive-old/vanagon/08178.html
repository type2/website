Subject: Re: replace lifters (hydraulic)

I'm in digest mode, so maybe this has been talked to death. I also
apologize for not remembering to whom to give credit for earlier
comments.
 
Last summer I rebuilt my '77 and replaced the mechanical with the
hydraulic lifters. Here are some things I learned:
 
1) Mechanical pushrods have &quot;pointy&quot; ends and are aluminum. The
   pushrods for hydraulic lifters are steel and have rounded ends.
   I forget which are shorter but it makes a huge difference. I feel
   the reason I was able to buy my bus is because of a recent rebuild
   (punch marks on the rods &amp; caps) which installed hydraulic lifters
   but did not exchange the pushrods. The ends of the adjuster studs
   were worn silly, causing #3 cylinder to overheat &amp; detonate. A
   contributing factor may be driving at altitude in this condition: I
   bought the bus in WI; it had Oregon plates.
 
2) I don't recall needing a differently ground cam. But the cam was way
   worn (you know the picture of typical wear marks in Bentley). I got a
   new cam, and trusted what MoFoCo gave me. I would think a '78 camshaft
   would work just fine.       Now the story
   gains detail: The rebuilder told the owner the hydraulic valves means
   no adjusting. But the lack of care in the job leads to a lean-running
   engine, which demands attention on the mountain passes. Our intrepid
   heroine pays no mind until clouds of smoke billow from behind.
 
3) Bleeding the lifters as explained in Bentley is bloody well impossible.
   After several frustrating hours, I asked advice from MoFoCo in Milw., WI.
   The guy told me to &quot;squish -- and stop me if I'm being too technical --
   the lifter down while it is immersed in oil. Hold and repeat until all
   the air is pressed out.&quot; This is the method I later found in the book
   by Tom Wilson.
 
4) The initial start &amp; wear-in was the scariest moment of my life. The
   lifters were chattering to kingdom come, &amp; I thought I just blew the
   last few of my dollars out the tailpipe. As time went on, it quieted.
 
 
5) If you rebuild yourself be very attentive to everything. Bug your FLAPS
   (which in my case was 110 miles away) about everything. SInce I dropped
   roughly a grand on parts, I expect some advice. MoFoCo was cool in that
   respect. If you don't rebuild, find a specialist. I got my bus because
   the owner of the shop to which the bus was taken was honest enough to
   admit that he didn't know enough to work on the engine (maybe he also
   was wary of guaranteeing work on an unfamiliar machine).
 
Anyway, I heart my bus (even now, when it is in the teens). It was
definitely worth the trouble &amp; moola for the rebuild. I'm also very
happy with the retro-fitting of hyd. lifters, especially since adjusting
valves mean lying on the snow.
