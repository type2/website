Subject:      Another Syncro GL FS -- CA

I sent this to the San Diego server, which must still be down (or down
again).

The other day, I came across a Syncro GL for sale in the boonies.

Specifically:
1986 Vanagon Syncro GL
143,000 miles
Diff Lock
Power Mirrors
Power Steering
A/C
Weekender rear seat
Color is bronze metallic, brown interior.
California Desert vehicle (no visible rust, probably no rust anywhere).

The owner says it recently had heads done.  It has a rip in the driver's
headrest, a dent in the sliding door, heater fan motor inop, poor tires.

The owner's name is Dennis, at 760-647-1088.  The bus is in Lee Vining,
California, about 200 miles from anywhere, at the gas station where
highway 395 meets the Tioga Pass Road into Yosemite.  I looked, but did
not drive this one.  No, it is too far to go back, so I won't test drive
it for anybody.

Dennis says he has heard that these go for about $8000.  I said that I heard
that too, but knew of several for sale in the $5000 range.  The price is not
fixed -- he'll listen to offers, I think.

He also has a nice t-shirt available.  It shows a splitty bus on the Lee Vining
Canyon grade as a cartoon.  A Tioga Pass souvenir, for those that know this
rather fun (especially in a splitty bus!) road.
