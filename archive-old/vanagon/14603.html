Subject:       '67 Deluxe Saga Continued

Friends,

Yes, the saga continues.  For those who don't want to read the whole 
thing:  Moral of story - check out the used engine you just 
installed before you run it hard.

As those have been following know, the fuel pump shaft on this 1600 I 
just bought got snapped in two on my way to school the other 
day, stranding me.  It was in fact a BLESSING...

Well, I spent a few minutes last night with my magnet and string out 
on the freeway retreiving the bottom half of the fuel pump shaft 
which had fallen into the engine when I pulled the top half, and fuel 
pump stand out.  I was very fortunate, as it was just right below the 
hole.  I replaced the broken parts from my other engine, and put it 
all back together.

Out of curiosity, I checked the oil level.  It was down a QUART from 
the beginning of my 20 mile trip!!!  Wow. 

So I ripped off the vavle covers to check the gaskets, as there was 
oil burning off the heat exchangers when I died on Monday.  Well upon 
pulling off the vavle covers, I saw why I had lost a quart.  The 
seals were totally hard and rotted.

I had to use a screwdriver to chisel the cork off.  So I replaced 
them, with a new set I had there, and started the bus up.  No 
problems other than something is wrong with the generator.

A friend says that the voltage on the bus is higher than the bug 
engine is used to, hence the generator or voltage regulator blew out. 
Opinions?  (This is a '67) and like a '72 1600 dual-port.
