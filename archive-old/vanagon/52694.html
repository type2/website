&gt; I recently hard wired in a remote start switch to my engine bay.

&gt; There were lots of warnings about NOT using the terminal 15 coil lead 
&gt; for supplying power for timing lights, etc with the Hall distribution 
&gt; system, so I needed another hot source.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Disadvantage is that none of the dash warning lights function as 
&gt; power is supplied by another piece of the ignition switch.
&gt; 
&gt; I had forgotten to post this until reading about Craig's dead '74.  
&gt; Modifying wiring like mine would allow Craig to diagnose dash 
&gt; separate from engine wiring. (Clara, are you lurking?)
&gt; 
&gt; Any downsides to this I missed

    This is DANGEROUS!!!!!!!!!   I have seen people do this, with just
    temperary switchs.  After an hour or so of playing with something,
    and driving the car around a bit,  they forget that they left the 
    car in gear, and try to start the thing. Most of the time they 
    get lucky and It don't start.

    After seeing a dragster demolish 3 homes, I said I would
    never use one.!!!
