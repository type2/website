&gt;&gt;Clay, 
&gt;&gt;IMO, and many others too, we love the '78 model best.
&gt;&gt;How come you want to sell?  Anything to do with the FI, or was
&gt;&gt;that already removed?  I'm real interested to hear what you have to say.
&gt;&gt;Thanks, 
&gt;&gt;Paul
&gt;&gt;'79 Bus

I agree that of the pancake buses, the 78 is the best, that is why I 
 bought this one in the first place. This present bus was a non-runner 
 when I picked it up for $400, at the time I figured that I could 
 either rebuild it or part it out and come out ahead. I may still 
 continue down the rebuild stage because for the most part the body is 
 in good shape, the camper equipment is fine, and it has potential. 
 What is swaying me from the path is a 72 camper that is gorgeous *NO 
 RUST!* looks like new inside and runs like a champ. I would keep the 
 2.0 engine to rebuild later and drop in for more power, hydraulic 
 lifters Etc. I would also strip the 78 of every possible item I would 
 need in the future like lenses, windshield, bulbs, calipers, rotors, 
 drums well you get the point. I would then sell stuff that is a 
 duplicate or not needed like FI components, tent canvas, jalousie 
 windows, ebersbacher gas heater, AC unit, and whatever anybody else 
 wanted. I think I could recoup a few bucks to make the deal work. I 
 will post the list whenever I have made my decision so stay tuned.

Clay
