Subject: Re: Insurance Companies Rated by Consumer Reports

     I often use Consumer Reports for input in my decisions, and often
     even agree with them. Sometimes not. Aetna is at  the bottom of
     the list, primarily because of &quot;poor&quot; claims service.

     I have been insured with Aetna for several years, had a small
     claim or two, when my SO took the impossible to retouch Pearlescent
     White Audi into the side of an concrete pier &quot;protecting&quot; an ATM
     machine.

     I found the best body shop in DC - Wagonwerks (only German
     cars,please, and no VWs to be found in their immaculate shop).
     I dropped off the Audi, they faxed the $2600 estimate to Aetna, who
     approved it without even looking at the car!

     The shop did a beautiful job, using all new Audi genuine parts (double
     galvanized body panels) and great paint matching.

     I never even had to talk to Aetna. Now that is the type of claims
     service I love!

Automobile Insurance Companies

Following are the ratings of auto insurance companies by Consumer Reports, a
publication of Consumers Union, a non-profit organization.  Consumer Reports
accepts no advertising or monies, gratuities, favors, etc. for any of the
products or services it evaluates and compares.  You'll save lots of money
and make smarter purchasing choices over the next year if you'll subscribe.
I subscribe because it gives me lots of comparative information on products
and services and I don't like being suckered.  A subscription costs $24/year.

Consumer Reports

Boulder CO  80323-1166

These ratings are based on responses to Consumer Union's 1994 Annual
Questionnaire.  Almost 34,000 readers participated in the survey.  Buy the
October 1995 issue of CR for more details.  They also evaluate car batteries
and portable heaters in this issue, among many other items.
