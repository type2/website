Glad you mentioned this.


&gt; The reason the fridge burner goes off while driving, by the way, is usually a
&gt; faulty gasket seal in the combustion chamber. When this seal gets bad it lets
&gt; air leak out and that allows drafts in that chamber which causes the flame to
&gt; blow out. 
&gt; 

How would a non-mechanical type recognise a bad gasket seal, and where 
the heck is the combustion chamber?


&gt; This fridge is made in Luxumbourg, of all places. Unlike the other fridges in
&gt; the dometic line up.

Is this also true of the frig. in the Eurovan type camper for 94?


&gt; 
&gt; I assume you have cleaned the combustion chamber as per the instructions for
&gt; the fridge, now haven't you? 

Nope

&gt; 
&gt; Every westy owner on this list who hasn't taken their fridge out to clean the
&gt; combustion chamber is neglecting their camper. You know who you are if you
&gt; are reading this and you haven't done this yet! And if you have done it, then
&gt; it means you are a nerd and you are neglecting your family, your friends,
&gt; your job, your life...

Yup

&gt; 
&gt; Hummm...
&gt; 



sigh.....
