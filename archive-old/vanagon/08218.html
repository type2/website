&gt;A couple of caveats-check to be sure your light switch/relay can handle
&gt;the juice (if you opt for the 80/100W bulbs); my switch sort of, uhh,...
&gt;well,... let's just say I had to replace it...
&gt;I would probably recommend that you stay away from plastic lens covers
&gt;that you can get; I ended up getting cracks in both lenses (didn't
&gt;really affect performance, but still, it allows condensation w/i the 
&gt;housing.)

We got glass lenses.  I will too.

&gt;
&gt;BTW, when I had 'em, they cut through the tule fog on Hwy 99 and I-5 like
&gt;a champ; I think you'll really like 'em, Thom.

Where do you live?  I drivethru the _exact_ same fog!

BTW - The _cool_ fog light item is the rear fog light.  On my 911 I have
a 45W(+/-) hella _rear_ fog light.  In dese fog, you see this puppy 
WAY before you see the taillights!  I have seen them on a few rabids, but
every one I ever saw was hooked up as a 3rd brake light! ARRRRRGGGGGHH!
