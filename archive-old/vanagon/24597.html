Subject: Re: 7 door panel ad nauseum

A walk-thru panel, &quot;jump-through&quot; bus with double cargo-doors, &quot;walk-though&quot;
two separate seats, 7 door panel, bench bus, non-walkthrough.

The '67 &quot;Westy Resto from Hell&quot; is gonna be a &quot;crawl over&quot; bus. I can see my
wife crawling over into the back area to get sodas out of the ice box or
wrestle with the dog. How convenient! =)

&quot;A rose is a rose is a rose~ Rose/Smoze who cares, have fun wid it!&quot; (First
draft of that famous tripe by W. Shakespeare)
