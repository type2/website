&quot;I've often wondered about crash worthiness of  my van.
I also wondered if 20 year old seat belts are any stronger than wet
lazagna noodles.

I've rationalized it this way:

1. I weigh more.
2. I'm higher, so won't hit any solid parts of little cars.
3. I've got a massive frame, bumper, etc.
Therefore I'll use up the other guys crumple zones, hence I don't
need any of my own.

Weighed against:

1. Seat belts are old, and could break.
2. If seatbelts don't break, I'm directly connected to the friggin' frame!
3. I start the whole process out about 6 inches from the accident instead
   of 4-5 feet that I would in my car.
4. No shock mmounted seat belts
5. No air bag.

Conclusion: Unless I hit a Miata, I'm toast! 

Anybody have other opinions, or data?

some friends of mine were happily tootling along in their 65 21 window one
day when this dingbat red neck pulled out of his driveway in front of them
leaving no time to stop.  The passenger door of the bus was wedged shut , and
the front nose crumpled in the impact under the right side headlight.  My
friends were fine.  Just shaken.   And luckily they got insurance money out
of it!!    The front frame under the floor of a split is very sturdy and
reinforced, and it was not even bent.  

I agree that the best safety measure is to stay alert and keep your beakes in
good order.

oh- and BTW the bus was saved- a new (old) nose was welded on, window pillars
and all, and the passenger door replaced- both same color as the bus.  it is
on the road and looks great!
