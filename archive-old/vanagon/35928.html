Subject: My own clumsy propaganda

	No one's fault but my own- I put in that comment from 
Mr. Buchanan (who scares the daylights out of me) at the bottom
of my .sig, but I didn't make it obvious I didn't agree with
the sediement expressed!  This is a VW list, so suffice to say
I don't really want to see additional import duties put on
the often imported parts for my favorite vehicles...

	Sorry to waste bandwidth. Happy motoring!

	Bill
