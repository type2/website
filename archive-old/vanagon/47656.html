Subject: Stereo &amp; overhead A/C

All,

I checked the FAQ and didn't see anything about this one...and I'm sure you
are getting tired of questions about my new '87.....

Anyway, the bus has the original speakers, 3 of the 4 are blown, so I need to
replace at least the speakers, and maybe the head unit too.  What is the
maximum size speaker that will fit in the overhead A/C at the rear of the
bus?  Front door panels??  I don't want a Giga-watt system with two or three
batteries, just something that sounds nice over the road noise.  Any advice,
reccomendations, stories, etc. on speaker installation, amp placement, and
such would be appreciated.

Please reply direct - ThatVWGuy_at_AOL_dot_com

Thanks,
Dan
