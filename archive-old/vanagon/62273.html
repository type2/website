Folks - the Popular Mechanics CD is actually made by Alldata. I was the
product manager for Alldata's biggest competitor, Mitchell
International's On-Demand for many years so have some inside info on
this stuff. Alldata arranged for a license to use the PM name and
marketing power. A tidy arrengement, which becomes more clear if you
know that Alldata got much of their service information for their
professional CDs from Motor Manuals, a Hearst company, and PM is also a
Hearst company. Now you see even more evidence of this trend to buy
familiar names, such as the &quot;Car &amp; Driver&quot; brand air cleaners now at
Target, &quot;Mad&quot; TV, etc.

&gt; Check the Popular Mechanics web page. They offer a set of CD-ROMs with both
&gt; the factory service bulletins and general mechanics info. For a given fee you
&gt; get the unlock code for one model and year, and I'm told they have all the VW
&gt; stuff included. (Other years / models still there for another fee.)
&gt; 
&gt; I remember seeing the same CD-ROM idea available somewhere else - Oh yeah -
&gt; http://www.alldata_dot_com/consumer/TSB/yr.html - the Alldata service bulletin
&gt; CD-ROMS. Check out that website - you enter your year, type (Volkswagon Truck)
&gt; and model and get a listing of all the recalls and service bulletins on the
&gt; CD-ROM - lets you see if it's worthwhile to order. It lists 152 TSBs for the
&gt; '87 Vanagon.

&gt; Hey Volksters,
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know how to get technical bulletins from VW. I noticed that
&gt; there are quite a few for my vehicle and I was wondering how I might get
&gt; my hands on them to see what VW does about the problems. Thanks.
&gt;
