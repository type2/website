&gt; My idle cut-off valve on my left (stock) carb on my 1972 VAN is stripped out. 
&gt; To remedy this I stuck a teflon coated 8mm course thread bolt in the hole.  At
&gt; least it's not leaking fuel from there anymore.   Questions. 1) What harm am I
&gt; doing or problems am I creating?  2) Eventually I am going to fix this, I hear
&gt; (see) a lot of discussions about Webers.  Is this an upgrade that is worth
&gt; while? what is the merits of a Weber over the stock Solex? 

Jeez, a proliferation of posts on the carbs today.

1.  I couldn't get them to run right with the holes simply plugged.  I'm
	told you need a metering device of some kind in there.

2.  Most people seem to think the Webers aren't that good.  My
	experience bears that out, but YMMV.  

If I were you (and I have had the same problem) I would get a carb body
that isn't stripped out and transfer all of your parts onto it.  Come to
think of it, that's what I did.  You could also put a helicoil in there,
but I HATE helicoils.  They make me as mad as a baby with a new tooth.
