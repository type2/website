&gt;Dear Austin,
&gt;    I just read your idle fix in Vanagon archives and wanted to ask,
&gt;have you had any further problems since with your idle??  Also, my idle
&gt;also goes up to 2000 rpm after warm-up, but sometimes it comes down and
&gt;is back to about 900,  did yours do this before you fixed it???  Do you
&gt;think your fix would work in mine??    My problem is new, as I had the
&gt;idle control valve unplugged for a long time, and it then stayed at 900,
&gt;but would die when i turned on the AC...
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for any ideas !

Hi Peter - Yeah, mine is still working fine (really ticks me off that the
dealer replaced it rather than doing this adjustment... $230!!!).  Anyway,
I can't emphasize two items too much: 1) *everything* else has to be
operating properly; i.e. this should be the last thing you adjust because;
2) the adjustments are extremely sensitive...a little does a lot.  As a
test, since getting it where I want it, I've moved the screw back'n'forth
1/4 turn, and am able to re-create the symptoms that we read repeated so
often on this list.

Austin

p.s. - keep in mind this is an '87 Digifant system...I'm not familiar with
other Vanagon setups (but I can do a Rabbit CIS blindfolded!! which will
probably get me a cuppa???).
