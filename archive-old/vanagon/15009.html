$$1) get a new head, very hard to find and expensive 1000 for VW
$$or 500 for pattern. down side is the block could be busted.
$$2) get a recon motor, again 1000 and could again show same
$$problem quickly (most UK specialists tell me the 1.7 is a DOG)
$$3) Put in a 1.6 Turbo, 2000 brand new motor, Seems like a good bet
$$4) Put in a 1.9 TDi (audi80 unit) a local co can do this for 2000
$$again this is a brand new unit. Problems what to do with gearing
$$if i put this in given that it chucks out 50% more power than the
$$1700

Man, you have a lot of diesel options!  If only diesels were more popular 
here in hamuraka (just kidding, ahm a patriot tew).  

As a once-funny line from a Chevy Chase movie went:  &quot;...how much you got?&quot;

Seems like the battle is between the 1.9 TDI and the 1600TD, both for two 
grand...hmmmmm...the only difference would be potential gearing problems 
due to the power of the TDI...Right.  

Go for the TDI, if it will cost the same.  Gearing?  Make some extra $$ 
pulling stumps from yards!

Good luck!
