&gt;Okay, I once had 28 passengers in my van...
&gt;
&gt;Anyone had more?

I thought i had the record with a measly 12 people in my '85...I was
definitly feeling the effects of that load.

Bus related:  I went to fill up the bus today and i wanted to use my ATM
card to pay.  it didn't work and i had to leave my watch as collateral,
anyway, when i returned with cash and paid; i was given my watch back and
while putting it on i felt that i had just been released from prison and i
was given my belongings back. oh well it felt weird...

&gt;From my roomate:  &quot;goddamn, don't you guys think you like your busses a
little too much&quot;
