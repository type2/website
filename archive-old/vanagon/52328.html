To Tonya Pope:

I haven't followed the entire thread on you problems but from what I
have read, you haven't checked for vacuum leaks yet. Vacuum leaks are
temperature sensitive and can come and go with vibration, engine loads,
and all those other frustratingly impossible things to track.

Hoses are a lot cheaper than a cat converters to replace.

Wish you luck,

&gt; It's so erratic it's frustrating.  Yesterday it worked like a charm. I
&gt; had done NOTHING since my last post where it wouldn't go up and down
&gt; driveway.  Today, I couldn't make it to the corner.  It idled okay, but
&gt; surged and cut-out when I pressed the gas (incidentally--it was quite
&gt; cold both days--at least for Louisiana--around 50 degrees).
