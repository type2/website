&gt;Hi Volks,
&gt;   Just wondering who was going to the Litchfield Bug Inn this weekend?
&gt;And home many are going to the campout at Looking Glass Hill Campground?
&gt;I'll be there.  Look for me playing the GREAT music at the show.  See you
&gt;then.

Hi Jim,

We plan to be at the campout and the Bug-Inn.  We'll have our white on red
'71 Westy with a white covered spare on the nose and white rims (like,
there'll probably be a dozen or so of those!).  Hope to see you and other
listers there.
