Subject: fold up table

Dear Vanagoners,

        I have a 91 Vanagon Carat with what I guess is the weekender
package; the rear seat folds down into a bed, there is a table which fits
flush to the wall mid way on the drivers side, just under a flourescent lamp.
        My problem is that the table is somehow jammed. It will not pop up.
When functional, it used to unhook automatically when pushed in. One then
pulled it all the way up and it snapped into position. One pulled a handle
under the table to unhook it to fold away, and it latched automatically upon
folding down onto the wall. 
        Removing the two screws accessible at the top (the pivot mechanism)
does not help free it. It's impossible to see what's stuck behind the table
and Bentley offers no help. Any ideas?
