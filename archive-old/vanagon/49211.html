Must be a bad tach readout;  my '87 will redline _at_~ 68 in third, stock
tires, gearing etc.  Actually the engine will start cutting out (by design)
just at redline - you'd swear the motor mounts all broke at once.  I
regularly make the run from the Bay Area (that's the  *San Jose* Bay Area!)
up to Truckee (Lake Tahoe); there are 4 +steep+ grades that I have to plan
ahead for - run 'er up to 75+ in 4th, maintain full throttle until the
speedo is down to 50; downshift &amp; run back up to 65, do it all again as
often as necessary to crest the hill.
