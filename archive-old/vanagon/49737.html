What are the legal ramifications/issues involved in rescuing 
an abandoned vehicle? I have had my eye on a bug carcass ..........

Some times it's hard to find the owner and persuade him/her to part with an
old VW.  Oh, I'm going to get that going&quot;.  yeah, right.   But don't just go
take the d*mn thing, that's just asking for trouble.         You can look in
the county records to find out who owns the property, for a start, or ask the
neighbors.
