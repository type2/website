Subject:      Recommendations for Vanagon Shop/Mechanic in South Bay (CA)

Hello,

I'm looking to buy a water-cooled Vanagon and would like recommendations on
a shop to evaluate the mechanicals of potential buses.  I like in
Sunnyvale, but would be interested in good places in the south bay (Santa
Clara, San Jose, Mountain View, etc.).

Thanks,

Greg Payne
