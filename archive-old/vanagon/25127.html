Subject: 196? vw bus half track.  no kidding.

i just got the latest issue of &quot;Split Screen Van Club's&quot; news letter.  on 
one of the pages that coverd the &quot;Bad Camberg&quot; meet in germany there is a 
picture of a sixty-something half track.  it looks to use the rear wheels 
as the drive wheel and the fronts as the other end.  in between are two 
other wheels that where added in.  it was really cool.  anyone else see 
this or know anything else about it?
take care and GOd BLess
matt
