Ron--

	Thanx for the feedback.

&gt; The Westfalia conversion has the propane connections mounted on the side of
&gt; the van, rather than hanging below the van.  This results in at least 4&quot; of
&gt; clearance at the middle of the van.

	I consider the Winnebogo design better.  For my use, the clearance
is not a problem and the accessibility (for maintenance, replacement) would 
seem to be an advantage.  And it saves valuable interior space.
  
&gt; I'm not sure about the EuroVan westie, but the Vanagon Westie has a pop-top
&gt; that raises MUCH higher than the Eurobago.  In the Eurobago, it's fairly
&gt; claustrophobic for an adult to sleep in the top bunk, whereas in the
&gt; Vanagon westie there's a lot more vertical space.

	A good point that I've noticed as well.  However, I enjoy sleeping
up top, especially since their are screens on 3 sides.   I don't feel
claustrophobic.  And the extra headroom whilst standing at the galley is
certainly not necessary and would be just more interior air to heat in cold
weather.
