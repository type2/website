&gt;My 84 has developed the annoying problem of during cold (as if it ever
&gt;gets cold in California) the leading edge (closest to the back of the van)
&gt;does not pop away from the door frame enabling the door to slid backwards.
&gt;As the outside temperature increases, this problem goes away.  I have been

First, (as was mentioned earlier) get the majority of the crud and stuff off of
the latch. Also run a finger down the rack that it runs in to the rear. Feel for
rusty metal and/or wasp nests. (Dont laugh...experience)

Another thing to check, (more experience) is the screws and bolts that hold
the latch hardware to the door. They often fall out. The latch cannot fall off,
it is toggled in there, but the bolts can be loose or out. They were on mine, and
it would not engange or disnegage smoothly. I cleaned and oiled it and that helped
a little. Then I noticed the empty holes. A couple of 'spare' screws from the dashboard
fixed that (tough to get in) and now it slides like greased lightning.
