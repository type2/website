Subject: Re: Type 2 Engine Mount

&gt;        Same thing happened to me, but I swapped out engines between my Bus
&gt;and Bug. I did buy the adaptor, however, for later use. It is Bugpack part
&gt;#4538 and should be available from any VW flaps. I paid $12.50 + tax for
&gt;mine.

I've considered buying one of these adapters and keeping it with my spare
parts on board the bus.  Despite my obsessive maintainance I still fear the
dreaded engine self-destruct 3,000 miles from home and it seems it would be
easier and cheaper to just bolt in a bug engine to get back.  Stressing the
oil pump studs would be a concern for long term use, but anything goes when
it comes to getting home (just ask Bob).
