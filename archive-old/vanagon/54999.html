Subject: EV MV (still) For Sale in Mass.


All you EV wannabees the local VW dealer still has a white 1993 EV MV w/55k 
miles for sale (just like mine). Its been there since thanksgiving. They 
want $13,999....but I would suspect they'd take less. I've looked at it and 
its in real good shape...its almost a twin of my EV/MV.

Its at Pearson-Miller VW, RT 6, North Dartmouth. 508-999-4573.
