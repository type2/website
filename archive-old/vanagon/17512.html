Subject: BA Sunday Brunch 5/21

I thought I would call a little Vanagon/Bay Area Brunch.

It's at JD's in Castro Valley.  It's at 2837 Castro Valley Blvd., and at 
about 12 Noon.  Martha's keen on the idea, so that's two of us.

Good food, and plenty of it, priced starting at $5 for the meals.  A la 
carte items are available as well.  Rumour has it that they also serve 
really good beer and Mimosas.  There's somthing about them having good 
pie as well, but after good beer, who cares.  :)

	WHAT: Brunch 

	WHERE: JD's, 2837 Castro Valley Blvd.  Castro Valley, CA
	
	WHEN: May 21, 12 Noon

	WHY: What the hell, and they got beer and good coffee.

	OTHERS: This can be considered a Bodega Bay logistics meeting.

	DIRECTIONS: Take 580 to Castro Valley.  Take the Strobridge exit, 
		and turn north (left from 580W, right from 580E).  Go to 
		Castro Valley Blvd., turn right.  It's about 1 mile up on 
		the right.
