Subject: Re: Side window screens?

Lots of the original camper parts on Westys came from:
Euro-American RV Products
(Delta Six Industries)
5517 Cleon Avenue
North Hollywood, CA 91601
818-760-4214

Give these folks a call. Chances are that they made the original
screens on yours, and can supply a replacement. FYI - I have an
'81 Westy, and the side window screens are plastic, and snap on
to the outside of the side windows
