&gt; Anyone have any idea what 15&quot; beauty rings for old bus
&gt; wheels are going for?  Last I heard a set of 4 NOS 14&quot; rings
&gt; were $75-100 and I assume the 15&quot; version pulls in a higher
&gt; price.
&gt; 
I have found that the 14&quot; alum. trim rings (not the kind that is held on 
by the hubcap) are much harder to come across than the 15&quot;.  Reason being 
that the 15&quot; came on convertible Bugs &amp; also Ghias in addition to 63 &amp; 
earlier Deluxe Buses.  The 14&quot; only came on 64-67 Deluxe Buses (perhaps 
continuing on into 68??).

NOS prices on these I don't hear much on as most folks restore or have 
someplace restore their old ones.  The metal is very 'soft' and can be 
usually be repaired and refinished.  Prices?  As in so many other items, 
they can vary quite a bit.  8-)
