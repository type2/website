Subject: Wiper Motor???

I need to R&amp;R the wiper motor in my split window bus.
Could someone briefly describe this proceedure?

It looks like its buried up against the front wall,  Must I remove the 
dash assembly or is there another way? (I suppose cutting a hole in the 
front exterior is another way :(    )

Is it possible to &quot;rewind&quot; this motor once it is out (1965, assuming it is 
something simple)?
What are the chances of finding another?
New? 
Used?   
Cost?
Thanks,


Corbin
