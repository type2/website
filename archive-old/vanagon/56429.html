&gt; &gt;While playing in my new-to-me 89 Westy, I discovered that I have a
&gt; &gt;(Ebersach (sp?) gas heater, with a control panel mounted on the wall behind
&gt; &gt;sliding door to the left of the rear ashtay.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;There are two flashing lights, one green, and obviously meaning all systems
&gt; &gt;go, but when the  dial is on 1 (dial is 1 to 7), the red light blips.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;How long should I keep this running when the engine is off?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Any advice?
&gt; 
&gt; I've never heard of an Eberspacher control panel mounted there. Are you sure
&gt; it's an Eberspacher??
&gt; 

My '86 Westy Multivan has the Eberspacher control in exactly this 
position.  In addition there is a separate timer unit on the dash.  
The red light  is an overheat indicator - if this is lit then the 
heat function is switched off automatically and the fan left to run 
until everything cools down.  The green light should be steady on and 
not flashing if everything is running OK.  Normally if  the pre-set 
temperature is reached (set on the dial) then the heater shuts down 
and leaves the fan running again  until everything is cool 
('automatic control of delayed shut off feature for cooling the 
heater' - according to a label next to my control panel).

These heaters are full of safety cut offs, and I've had a real battle 
trying to keep it running.  Once it is ok though, it is really good 
and have run it overnight when camping with no problems.

Good luck,
Rich Lumb
'86 Westy
