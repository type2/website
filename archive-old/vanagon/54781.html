Subject: Re: Diesel verse gas?

Diesels are a different animal all to themselves. There is some truth to
the better atomization of the fuel, which does lean itself towards better
burning. But that's where it stops. Diesels have a pollution all their own
and it is very difficult to eliminate it. The prime area of concern is the
soot, the black smoke you see when a diesel is under hard acceleration. I'm
sure there is a chemical composition of this soot but I don't know what it
is. Vw's new diesels use a direct injection system, as opposed to the older
swirl chamber design. This allows a more complete combustion. But also
greatly increases the noise. Diesel trucks have used direct injection for
years. Although there are no tune ups per se. You have to be careful with
your fuel, especially in the colder climates or you won't go anywhere. HTH

&gt;Does anyone know where I can find information on the exhaust gas components

&gt;of finding a TDI to put in because of the mileage, the seemingly more
&gt;resilient design and no iginition system to get all fouled up or cut out, or
&gt;the like.
&gt;	From what I understand of diesel engines, they supposely burn more
&gt;cleanly than gas as long as the injectors are in proper functioning order.
&gt;Am I way off the mark here? Is proper functioning order something you
maintain
&gt;for oh, about 100 miles of running? And because of the way the injectors are
&gt;supposed to work, you get a better dispersion of fuel which ends up giving
&gt;one a cleaner burn. Is this incorrect as well?
&gt;
&gt;	Basicly, I would like an engine that spews the least amount of noxious
&gt;gases out the tailpipe as possible. Is diesel a decent candidate or am I way
&gt;off the mark? Having search the EPA web pages and the general web, I couldn't
&gt;find any discussion of diesel engine emission for either heavy trucks or
&gt;cars. Any info is greatly appreciated...
