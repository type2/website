Subject: (fwd) FS EV Camper Kit

I found this in the local (The Netherlands) free-ad paper:

**********
Camper Kit for new model Transporter T4 LWB highroof, includes:
closets, bed, kitchenblock, pillows foil etc. price: the
equivalent of US$700
**********

I don't have anything to do with them/it/this but if you're interested
i can call and find out what you'd like to now. shipping possible.

Brian.
