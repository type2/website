&gt;We have just been rolling the bus until we think they

uhhhhhhhh ... how come you're adjusting valves on a 2.0 liter? all the
two liters i know about have hydraulic valve lifters and don't need to be
adjusted.

however ... :) as i can dimly recall (having been on hydraulic lifters now
for 15 years), there was a notch on the distributor bottom and when the
rotor was lined up with the notch AND both valves on #1 cylinder were loose
then #1 as as close to TDC as needed to be for adjustment. i think there is
a pretty good bit of range on the cam, so as long as both valves are loose,
you can adjust it correctly.

after #1 is adjusted you just turn the crank pulley backwards so that the
rotor goes 90 degrees in the 'wrong' direction, and that's #2. then another
90 degrees is #3, and another 90 degrees is #4.

somebody who still does this jump in and fix my memory lapses.
