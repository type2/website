It's a very easy replacement and will cost around $80 or so as I remember. 
Well worth the money IMHO--in fact this is the best upgrade in terms of 
driveability that I have come across for my '74. Wish my '87 had lights 
this good.

Anyway, it's a drop-in replacement. Just remove the sealed beams and 
replace with Hella units that you obtain from a good FLAPS that handles 
Volks stuff. You are looking for non-sealed beam lamps with replaceable 
bulbs. They may disclaim that these are for off-road use only, but pay no 
mind. You should have your headlight alignment check after you install the 
new lamps. Be sure that you don't touch the halogen bulbs with your 
fingers!
