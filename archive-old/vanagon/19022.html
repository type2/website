Subject: Knock, knock

Otto has developed a knock that I don't like.  

I first heard it about a year (20,000 miles) ago, and it was occasional even
then.  It's a deep &quot;knock-knock-knock-knock&quot;--definately not a lifter
sticking, though he occasionally has one of those too.  I hear it from the
drivers' side of the engine, only when starting from dead cold, and it goes
away after 10 seconds or so, not to be heard again until the next start from
dead cold.  First I thought it might be because our parking area is on a
slight incline, but the knock's still there if I park on the flat driveway.
Otto has a stock 2000, rebuilt at about 108,000, and now has 164,000.  The
engine has been fairly pampered (lots of oil changes, etc.)

Do Otto and I have a problem developing?

Thanks,
