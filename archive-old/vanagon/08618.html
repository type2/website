&gt; Concerning head temps:  You might ask Sami about his setup.  I seem to
&gt; remember him saying that he had a sensor on #3 and #1, with a switch 
&gt; at the gauge.  I wonder what his readings are.  I think his bus is a 
&gt; '73.  I read this list too closely sometimes.  Jim

Sami's bus is a 75, fuel-injected 1.8 with Volvo seats.  :)
