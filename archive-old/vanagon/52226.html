&gt; On this page I selected the 1990's link and there at 1991 is a picture =
&gt; of a vanagon that has quad round headlights.  I have  four rectangular =
&gt; headlights on my '87 Westy.  Is a conversion to quad round headlights =
&gt; available?  I have only seen dual round headlights.
&gt; 
&gt; - Charlie.When I had a vanagon and wanted quad headlights: 
Standard in sweden was dual, you removed the original grille, and 
replaced it with a new one with two holes for the original headlights, 
and two ready mounted extralights. The grille was slightly dark/grey 
rather than coal black, and had no VW bagde in the middle. I think it 
was made by Votex gmbh in germany. I never got a chance to buy one, my 
VW dealer couldnt find one anywhere.
