Subject:       Re: Is Lobro a good make for CV joint?


&gt; I can get a so called Lobro (umlaut over the first o) CV joint kit
&gt; (includes boot, grease, clips etc) for GB#41.12 (approx US$65).
&gt; 
&gt; Are Lobro any good for CV joints?
As far as I have heard, they are considered one of the best, and are 
VW OEM I believe. Lobro is all I have used on Rabbits/Golfs/Jettas.

&gt; Also I have seen an advertorial in VW Motoring for CV boots from Bailcast
&gt; (Tel: 0044 1257 266060) called Sticky Boots. They are split and you wrap
&gt; them around the joint then super glue the seam. I have not checked if they
&gt; do a Van one, but the Golf one is GB#9.09. Do you think its worthwhile?
Since my current boots on my Jetta have lasted 180k (at least) since 
I bought it, I wouldn't waste any time with split boots. To do a 
proper inspection, cleaning &amp; repack, the CV has to come out, which 
means the split boots won't save any time. 
BTW, both Lobro CVs, and most german made boot kits usually come with 
a tube of moly CV grease, menaing you don't have to search for the 
right stuff.
