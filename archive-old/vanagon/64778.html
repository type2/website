Subject:      86-91 coolant flange

on the 86-91 engines, there is a small flange attached to the rear end
of the engine, over under the alternator. from the flange, there is a
small coolant hose that runs to the &quot;bleeding ring&quot; ... a pipe that runs
round the engine compartment and helps bubbles get out of the engine.
well, the original flanges are plastic, and over time they bend/warp and
the little o-ring seal starts leaking.

yup. did it a while back on my 88 bus, now my 87 camper needed it. well,
says i to me, i ain't gonna get coolant in my hair again THIS time ...
i'm gonna figure a better way to do this. so i sits down and studies.

first of all, the power steering pump is kinda in the way ... so i look,
and there are only three bolts hold the pump on. ok, out comes the three
bolts (the frontmost is kinda hard because of a fuel line; and the middle
one needs the alternator v-belt loosened. and the alternator pushed to the
left ... hey! i didn't say it was &quot;easy&quot;!! ;)
then the steering pump can be moved over the the right ... you don't have to
disconnect any hoses or anything.

ok. so now the pump is moved over, and the alternator is pushed to the left
and the steering v-belt is moved out of the way. NOW you can get to the
coolant flange real easily.

now, when you start loosening the two bolts holding the flange on, there's
gonna be a LOT of coolant coming out ... about a gallon ... so have a wide
(cause it goes all over) deep pan under there, and move the v-belts out of
the way so they don't get all slimey with coolant.

the new flanges (from vw) are metal, and have NO o-rings ... there is supposed
to be a gasket, but i can never get the vw dealers to send me the right one.
an o-ring will NOT work (it slides all over the place).
... so i went down to NAPA and got some gasket material ...

part no. STM-1 Adhesive Backed Heavy Duty Gasket Material
         (look under the thermostats section/area in the store). for all
         gasket uses involving oils, fuels and water ... temperatures up to
         300F.
         the gasket material has adhesive on one side (which i applied to
         the flange side) ... and i spread some RTV high-temp gasket gunk
         on the other side, just for paranoia. ;)

the flange itself is part no. 025-121-160-D
         (make sure you get this one ... it's the metal one).

all total, of fooling around, and loosening all that stuff, then putting it
all back together, and going in the garage, then in the house, then in the
other bus to find something ... i guess it took about 2.5 hours. :) i may be
slow, but i do poor work!!!! ;)  i can do it a lot faster next time (if i
get all the damned tools out to the camper FIRST!).

unca joel
