Subject: Another Cincinnati show comment...with pics

Greetings all;

I just finished scanning the first couple of pictures from the Cincinnati
show this past Saturday. You will find pics of Ted Finesman's van,
Erik O's Westy Vanagon with a GTI engine, and somewhere in the
background on one you'll see a glimpse of the Mothership :)  This was
the first batch of photos (only a partial roll); I have a full
roll of 36 yet to be developed.

This was my first event (surprise!) and the sun and the heat showed
up to help celebrate. It was good to meet people I've talked to and
see some great busses- provides a bit of inspiration to know
the potential of your vehicle when trying to figure out why it
won't start :)

I'm not much of a bug fan, so the drag races we're really only
a minor distraction while talking to people about their vans. :)

I'm currently planning on attending BBtA, right after I move this next
week.... (only a block away).

I'm sure I missed some information with the pix I posted; let me
know and I'll change the relevant places. I'll send an update when
I get the other pix done.

Ciao
Geosh
