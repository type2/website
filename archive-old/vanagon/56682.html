Subject: 86 Vanagon snycro FS

Hi all. Saw this vanagon on the side of the road and gave it a quick once
over. The pertinent information is below. I have no connection other than
posting this note. The vanagon is located on route 137 in Jaffrey, NH. I
can give directions if desired.
        1986 syncro vanagon - 4(5) speed, A/C, Am/Fm, extra set of studded
tires and wheels(don't know if this means 2 or 4), 93k, Asking $4500. Call
603 - 585-2259. (Note on the vanagon said Blue Book value is $8400, which
blue book is that?) Anyway, the interior looked good, both middle and rear
seats there, the coolant overflow was full, the body looked real good,
didn't go underneath in the rain, overall seemed okay. Good luck, and if
someone is interested I could be convinced to go check the under body more.
