well, one thing about the pink (or in my case, yellow) insulation is that
if you put it on the rear hatch, be careful about how much you stuff in
there ... mine got too heavy for the weak old struts. :(  had to get the
expen$ive little shock absorbers replaced.

the 3M spray on stuff really does help about the 'drumming' noise of the
big metal panels, though. i wonder if maybe a big 'X' made from duct tape
would work?? maybe a couple of layers of duct tape. i think the trick here
is to stop the metal from vibrating so much. the pink stuff helps deaden the
noise by stopping it from coming through so easily, but the spray on stuff
stops it by preventing the noise in the first place. 3M stuff IS expensive,
though. it works good, but it costs.

injector cleaner: uhhhhhh ... i think i'd use that Chevron Techron injector
cleaner. only trouble with it is that you can't run but a couple of bottles
through the system between oil changes.  i think the transmission fluid idea
is a very old thing that goes back to Bardahl engine cleaner ... stuff like
tranny fluid that you poured down the carb. made big huge clouds of smoke
(supposed to let you know that you are doing some good! ... also just happened
to kill any mosquitos for about a mile around. :)
