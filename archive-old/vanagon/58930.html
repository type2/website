Subject: 82 westy for sale

I spied  an 82 westy for sale: brownish color, good interior, AT, poptop, sink, stove, heater, engine rumored to have a problem with one cylinder. There is a bit of rust in the following places:
rear hatch corners, slider corner. below and behind passenger door (fuel filler area?). The underbody looks good.

The owner wants 1500.
Is this a good deal , too much or ???

I do not have much experience with vanagons, so am needing some advice.
Thanks
