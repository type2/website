Subject: Re: cops and buses

&gt;Since I am new to owning a bus and haven't even had the chance to
&gt;drive it around yet, I am curious as to what the attitude of cops have
&gt;been for people driving VW busses. Are you picked out and searched
&gt;often? Do you sometimes &quot;fit the description of someone&quot; they are
&gt;&quot;looking for&quot;? Do they assume you have drugs in the van?

I haven't been pulled over since... oh my... it was around county fair time
in summer of '79, back in my &quot;long-hair&quot; days.  My girl-friend at the time
was livid, 'cuz she said this was hassling, pure-and-simple...

...hmmm...

...now that I think about it some more, I was also pulled over by a
small-town-within-greater-Houston cop about 10 years ago who didn't think
anyone should be riding on top...

I had the mannequin (Quilla June - the top half of her, anyway; the bottom
half had long since faded into memory) bolted to the decking on the roof
rack, probably with a Santa hat on, and I saw this cop pull a classic U-ey
and then try to &quot;catch&quot; me, well outside of his tiny jurisdiction (hot
pursuit!?), before I could get away.  Something about not standing up
through the sun-roof (?!?) and then sheepishly sending me on my way...

Quilla has been a fun passenger.

Nothing other than that - so I guess we don't fit the current &quot;usual
suspects&quot; list.  My example may not be great though - most crinimals really
should try to be a little lower profile.

I've wondered if Mr. Bozo would get Humpty-Dumptied if I tried to take him
to Mexico and back, especially with the factory belly-pans to give the
frame more stiffness (what with the double-double-doors) and therefore more
places to stuff &quot;stuff&quot;.
