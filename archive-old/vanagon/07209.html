Subject:      1st gear popping out/jamming

also for you early vanagons:  stuart was asking about his transmission
popping out of 1st gear. this rang a bell with me about a 'fix' way back
when:

...     if you have the bentley book, check out page 34.5 (july 15, 1991
edition) ... it talks about adjusting the shift rods properly and says,

&quot;Note
&gt;From chassis No. BH 25 137 156 a new type mechanism housing has been
installed. If 1st gear is jamming on vehicles up to Chassis No.
BH 25 137 155 - even after correct adjustment is made -- install new
type shift mechanism housing and adjust distance 'a' to 22mm (7/8 in.).&quot;

i did this on my 80 bus and it helped a lot. i think the number of the
new shift housing ('box') was 251-711-107B (shift housing). i see by my
records that i also replaced a bushing (251-711-209) in the shift linkage
(under the shift lever) as well. in 1983, they both cost $15.27 US. :)
