Subject: Re: Intermittent rough running Waterboxer

&gt;I have a waterboxer engine that runs rough intermittently.  I wonder if 
&gt;anyone has run across this problem before.  It appears primarily on 
&gt;deceleration, as a bucking sensation.  It does not appear to exhibit the 
&gt;same symptoms that people have noted are cured with the P/N 025-906-302 
&gt;harness, although I haven't ruled that out.
&gt;
&gt;Not much to go on at this point.  I have changed the fuel filter - no 
&gt;noticable change.  Distributor cap, rotor, and plugs all appear fine 
&gt;(about 30,000 miles on them).  Will replace them regardless.  I 
&gt;had the catalytic converter off several months ago and it appeared in tack.
&gt;
&gt;Suggestions welcome and appreciated.

Hey Fred
  I have had a similar problem.  It occures at very light throttle, usually
coasting.  The engine bucks and jumps, increasing or deacreasing throttle
causes the bucking to go away.  The problem is intermittent,  usually when
its wet.  I have'nt had the problem in several thousand miles.  I think it
is related to a wiring problem, aggravated in wet conditions.  I don't know
if this is the same problem, but hope the added info may help to diagnose
the problem.
