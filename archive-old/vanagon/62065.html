Subject: My coffee cup arrived!


This morning I hoisted the first cup of java to run through my new &quot;4 bus 
design&quot; ceramic mug (organic guatamalen for those who need to know :)
Thanks Richard, I love my new cup! Nice packaging job also.
An extra bonus for me was that, as I unwrapped my new mug, my stunned 
eyes were greeted by the realization that the Vanagon pictured is green, 
just like Kermit!  Perfect!
I could be sitting in a Dodge Caravan drinking from a 7-Eleven paper 
cup, but I'm not.  This feeling of superiority should last clear into next 
week ;)
