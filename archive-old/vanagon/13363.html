&gt; I'm going to try this posting one more time and then give up. 
&gt; Just briefly (got it Thom), I think I got a good as to whether my 82 camper 
&gt; will go unleaded after a lifetime of leaded. I called one of our local dealer
&gt; a very reputable VW/Audi concern and asked them. The reply was that I could run
&gt; unleaded without any problems, but every 5th tank should be leaded, that's a
&gt; +Pb/-Pb ration of 1/4. They have a lookup table which gives them the ratio
&gt; for evey age of vehicle. (The UK has only had unleaded for less than 10yrs I
&gt; think). He said  that it has something to do with the lead acting as a lubricant.
&gt; Can anyone shed any light on this. At least my fuel bill will go down slightly
&gt; and I will be do my bit for the environment, if I ignore the benzene and other 
&gt; stuff.

I run unleaded in my bus and my Capri with no problems.  Both of them grew
up on leaded gas.

&gt;         One question, can any one tell me the cost of the Bentley manual for 
&gt; 80-91 buses. I've seen it advertised here for about 60 English pounds, which         
&gt; is pretty hefty, the Haynes manual is less than 15.

It is expensive here too.  I remember it being close to US$100.
