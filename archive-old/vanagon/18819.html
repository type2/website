Subject: who made me and my bus

&gt;&gt;is your &quot;boat top camper&quot; an Adventurewagen or a Safari conversion? reason
&gt;&gt;i ask is that there are some others on the list by those companies.

As the bod is in storage i can not say who did the convertion.  I know it was
done i CA and i think the company name begins with &quot;C&quot;.  I will be seeing it
soon so i will check.  I am kind a curious about the company and whot not.

Thanks for the info

Steve Pribyl
72 camper
