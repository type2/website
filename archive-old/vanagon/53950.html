Item Subject: Snow Chains front ?
     Hi Dave,
     
       I posed a similar question to the list about a month ago.  I 
     infrequently go into the snow--mostly when I go into the mountains for 
     recreation.  After hearing all the recommendations, I got some 
     Z-Cables from a local chain (pun intended) store (GI Joes--no kidding 
     that's there name--&quot;go seize the weekend&quot; is there motto).  They are a 
     lot easier to put on than the cables for my Eclipse and they have a 
     &quot;Z&quot; or zig zag pattern on the cross cables that keep at least some 
     portion of the cable on the snow at all times as well as give you the 
     snow plow effect for traction--those familiar with skiing will 
     appreciate the ability to stop using this method. You can get a 
     similar (mine look identical to those in the catalog) set from JC 
     Whitney catalog for about $60 (I paid $45 at GI Joes)--they call them 
     Z-Chains. One listee highly recommended the JC Whitney brand for 
     ability to hold up after going through several other brands.
       Other advice I got was to use them only on the rear unless the 
     steering feels loose.  Most of the responses from the listee that live 
     in the snow recommended regular chains for there cost, effectiveness, 
     longevity, &amp; repairablity.
     
     Hope this helps,
