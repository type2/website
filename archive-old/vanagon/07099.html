&gt; &gt; sstones says the front hook/rectangle unit doesn't move at all, but it

I'm not sure about your problem, but I have had periodic problems with 
the door latch on my '85 Westy.

There is a small springwire with hook on it sort back inside the door 
panel which comes loose periodically. You need to reach in to that tight 
place, possibly with needle nose, and maneuver it up and around and reset 
it's hook into the latch mechanism. It'll probably come about again later.
