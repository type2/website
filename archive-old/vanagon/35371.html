Subject: re: gen questions. '87 syncro

Congradulations Tony! I'm sure you will enjoy it!

The '86 through '91 Vanagons all had a 2.1l engine as stock. Never
heard of a 2.3l hot rodding upgrade, but I suppose its possible...

&gt; Does anyone have suggestions of other easy
&gt; upgrades that might increase horsepower? 

Nothing easy that the owners around here know about...several
of us are looking into a 2.5 upgrade kit that looks like
$5-6K in parts. If its free horsepower you want, read 
the Sermons of Bob Hoover, the one of the list's more famous writers,
at http://www.sky_dot_net/~rmk/hoover/

&gt;I am also intersted in  doing some suspension work. Is it possible to &gt;lower the front end of a syncro (so  that it is level with t=
he rear), and &gt;are there any goodies  available, such as sway bars?

Hmmm... I want to raise my Syncro all around, not lower it. 
Normallly they are  pretty level, unless someone has inserted 
some spacers in the rear.

&gt; Finally, I really like the looks of the FUBA antenna (like on 16v
&gt; GTI's). Has anyone ever put one on top of their Vanagon? Is it worth
&gt; the  effort?

I have the Fuba on my Audi, and I can tell you what the F stands for
;-)! Forget it, IMHO. My Vanagon stock radio has much better reception
than my Audi stock radio and Fuba antenna. I have gone through
full diagnotics on the Fuba, BTW.

Have fun!
