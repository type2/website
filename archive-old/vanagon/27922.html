Subject: Re: best spotlight for Vanagons

For people that want a cheap and powerful light, I just got a catalog 
called The Sportman's Guide.  They have a 1.5 million CP light for 
$27.97.  And a mere 1 million CP light for $19.97.
The phone #: 1-800-888-3006
They're in MN.  And std disclaimers apply.
