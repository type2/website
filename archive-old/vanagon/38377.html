Subject: Re: Dormobile roof fit???

Does anybody know if the dormobile roof off a 70's era van will fit the
contour of the roof on a (currently) hardtop 65' westy??

Ive seen it done the other way, but idunno

But if you are you to cut that great big hole in your roof please be aware
that dormobile campers were made on sunroof combis bodies.  These had the
subfloors pans to give structural soundness to make up for that huge hole in
the roof.  So if you do out a dormoile top on, add subfloor pans.  Ditto for
those who want a sunroof/skylight top.
