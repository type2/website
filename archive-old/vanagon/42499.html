So Kelly Dean Barthlow says:
&gt; Jumped in the 89' westy yesterday and noticed a slight humming sound coming
&gt; from the fridge/cabinet area.  Can't be certain it was fridge but what else
&gt; could it be?  The ignition was turned off, there is no spare battery to run
&gt; fridge.  Flipped the 3-way fridge switch several times, humming still there.
&gt; Any thoughts?

That be your cooling fan.  Runs when it's warm whether you are using the
fridge or not.
