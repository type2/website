Subject: Re: /f Best SIG Award

Not to make Friday non-F or anything, but didn't Gerry (you all remember 
Gerry, don't you?) mention that the volume of mail running through his 
machine was raising a few eyebrows among the powers-that-be at his 
University?

Didn't he ask people to maintain VW-content in list messages, and to keep 
sig length down to a &quot;reasonable&quot; size?  I really, really, value this 
list, and I'd hate to see it threatened as a result of non-VW traffic.

FFFridays are a great idea, but personally, the best FFFF here is 
VW-related.  I'll subscribe to a humour group for non-VW humour or 
alt.dinosaur.barney.die.die.die if I want a content-free email diet.

I like the fun on this group too, don't get me wrong.  But when the 
signal-to-noise ratio hits zero, and sigs constitute over half the 
message size, it's time to cut it out, or at least take it off-line.

And don't even bother flaming me for this: I'll don my nomex any day for 
VW-related flame wars, but I'll just delete any flames on this one.

I've said enough.  I'll leave the &quot;cop&quot; stuff to Gerry, since it's his 
list.  Sorry for the bandwidth.
