Hi all again,

posting for a friend,  2nd owner 1987 panel van autobox

Grey ext/grey int with 2 seater front walkthrough. Usual seam rust, needs
doing soon. No major dings, parking lot dents only.  I'll check it out more
closely this week sometime.

Bare bones interior, never modified into camper etc. No heart shaped windows
in the side at all! Pure grey tin all around. Never a work vehicle.

197K kms, ~125K miles

good engine/trans, works well reportedly but I haven't driven it (yet).
Tempting replacement for my long gone '85 panel.

He wants $2500Cdn/best, ~$1800US.

bye, Tim
