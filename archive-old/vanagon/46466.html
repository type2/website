Subject: '87 Synro jerky running on highway

Could anyone help me diagnose this problem with my '87 syncro? When I've been
on
the highway for more than an hour the van will start jerking like its starved
for fuel. When 
I pull over while its happening, it stalls. It never stalls otherwise. Then
it starts right up and runs fine for another hour. This would be very hard to
reproduce for a mechanic.
I've owned the van for 2 months and 5000 miles. It only has 56000 on it.The
problem just started on my last of many 200 to 300 mile trips by highway. The
tach doesn't move during the incidences and the prob seems to be speed
sensitive--60 to 70
on level road. The jerks got larger with each hourly episode. Is it the fuel
filter, fuel pump, something with the limited slip or what? One  factor could
be that, I just disconnected the seat belt warning buzzer before the trip.
Perhaps that effected the fuel pump? Although the wiring diagram seems to
contra-indicate any connection.  I'm afraid to leave on a planned  trip cross
country with my van running like this. Thanks for any advice.
