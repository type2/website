Subject: i have been spying on the rec.autos.makers.crysler newsgroup!! (LONG)

Here are two interesting posts, enjoy.

&gt;Are Caravans Just Cold in the Winter.  Boy, Did I run into a mess on this
&gt;one.  I real cold weather, we were forced to have blankets on ourselves
&gt;for reasonable comfort.  Now, you say, &quot;That isn't right&quot;.  3 Caravan
&gt;service location say it is and I have the bills to prove it.  Everything
&gt;from flushing out the cooling system, replacing thermostat, r4placing
&gt;heater core, replacing blower motor, air conditioner valve replacement,
&gt;etc, etc, etc.
&gt;
&gt;The REAL cause of the problem turned out to be the &quot;automatic ajjustment&quot;
&gt;cable on the hot air door.  This is the door which allows the incomming
&gt;air to go across the heater core to provide heat into the interior of the
&gt;van.  The damn thing had misadjusted itself a number of times; possible
&gt;the design could be improved.  It took me almost 3 years to find the
&gt;solution myself even though it had been in for service a number of times,
&gt;without success.  One service bill even said the &quot;the automatic adjuster
&gt;was adjusted&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;The service manuals recommend a way to adjust the door to work correctly
&gt;but it isn't always successful even when it appears to be done correctly. 
&gt;The door must be opened wider than the recommendation implies then the
&gt;heat lever is forced to the cold position.  This automaticially readjusts
&gt;the cable connection to allow the door to open wider which forces more
&gt;(all) cold air across the heater core.  The secret is in the adjustment
&gt;and almost going by the book.  I have personelly been successful in fixing
&gt;a number of vans that didn't give out enough heat.  The job is easy once
&gt;you figure it out.
&gt;
&gt;This solution assumes all else is OK and seems to apply when nothing else
&gt;seems to provide enough heat.  My van is very toasty even in the coldest
&gt;New England weather.  It usually provides heat within 1 mile after
&gt;starting; and I don't warm up the van before driving away.
&gt;
&gt;I would gbe interesting in responses from people who try this.  It cost me
&gt;a lot of money to discover this answer on my 88 caravan, V6 3.0L.  We will
&gt;not talk of the engine replacement at a cost of $2600 or the head
&gt;replacement 14 months later at a cost of $1600, the horn that would blow
&gt;at any time (usually when you were asleep), or its tendency to
&gt;automatically engage the cruse control.

AND!!

&gt;My 88 Grand Voyageur w/3.0LV6 engine has a blown head gasket. The 
&gt;blowout is to a cooling system channel from cylinder 3, as determined by 
&gt;pressurizing the cylinder with compressed air and looking for bubbles at 
&gt;the thermostat opening. I did a valve job about a year ago because I had 
&gt;the burning oil/slipped valve guide problem at about 75000m, swapping 
&gt;both of my heads for rebuilt heads from a local machine shop.  I used a 
&gt;generic gasket set when I installed the rebuilt heads, following the 
&gt;Chrylser Shop Manual torque specs, i.e. 70 ft-lbs in three steps cold, 
&gt;did not retorque warm.  Six months ago I had a similar problem, with a 
&gt;smaller leak from cylinder 2 to the cooling system that only caused 
&gt;overheating after extended highway driving.  I replaced the head gasket 
&gt;on the front bank (2-4-6) with a Fel-Pro gasket and solved the problem.
&gt;
&gt;I need advice.  Even though I love changing head gaskets, my wife thinks 
&gt;I'm having an affair in the garage ;-).
&gt;
&gt;I have the following specific questions:
&gt;1) Are these type of problems typical or am I a klutz?  Do I have the 
&gt;torque specs right?
&gt;2) I heard Chrysler has a &quot;NEW&quot; head gasket for this engine with some 
&gt;kind of anaerobic sealant.  How new? Does it solve these problem?
&gt;3) Are there Technical Service Bulletins on the subject that I should 
&gt;read?  Please be specific, as I will be attempting to download them from 
&gt;Alldata or anywhere else you might suggest.
&gt;4) I plan to have the heads checked for flatness and planed if 
&gt;necessary.  What about the block?  My machinist suggested the top of the 
&gt;block may not be flat anymore?  Any corroboration for this possibility?


HA!  they dont seem that foreign anymore, those minivan owners.. they also
talk about rusted underbodies (from chrysler neglect) and tires... alot like
us..
