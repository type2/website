Subject: Eurobago Broken Top Update

I reported to the list that the poptop on my 1995
EV-Winnebago had developed a large vertical crack
up the side, 50 cm from the leading edge.

My wife took it to the dealer yesterday.

They gulped hard, said that they had never seen 
anything like it, and told her to take it away -
they would call us.

Sounds like they were burning up the lines to
Winnebago while it was in the bodyshop.

I'll keep you posted.  In the interim, it's
DUCT TAPE to the rescue!
