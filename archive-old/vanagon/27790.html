Subject: &quot;upgrade&quot; to 2.0 heads?
Date: Tue, 31 Oct 1995 13:55:12 -0600 (CST)

Just returned from the machine shop. Guy sez that bead-blasting revealed a
crack all around one of the heads, hence it's not rebuildable. He has been
looking for another &quot;1.8 F.I.&quot; head core, but couldn't find one, so he
suggests putting in a pair of 2.0 liter heads instead, which he has in
stock. As far as I know, the only difference is the size of the intake
valves, which is SMALLER on the 2.0. Any reason why this swap may be a bad
idea? (I figure that the smaller diameter will cause higher velocity of
the air/fuel mix, more turbulence, and hence better combustion, especially
at low rpm?)
