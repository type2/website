&gt; 
&gt; Hi,
&gt; 	I posted about this once but I think it might have not made it
&gt; out because of the problems the list has had.  I just wanted to let the
&gt; list know that I have set up an FTP server at my mac, bolo.nosc_dot_mil.  It
&gt; contains some pictures I scanned in yesterday, and I'll keep it going until
&gt; Enjoy!

I would if I had ftp access to the outside world (sniff).  I don't suppose
you could put this on a Web server?
