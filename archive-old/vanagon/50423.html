Subject: '77 Riviera II FS (NE Oregon)

ATTENTION WANNABUSSES!!!

Okay, I've owned all three types of type IIs (EVs don't count,  engine's at
the wrong end...) and the Vanagon is going to be the one to stay.  The
split went years ago So, here the loaf is:

1977 Riviera II Camper.
128k miles
2.0 liter 4 speed
a little surface rust in doors, NONE in floors or body (including battery tray).

Has (stock unless otherwise noted);
3/4 length poptop that goes straight up (6'-6&quot; headroom)
Excellent canvas
Two burner Coleman stove
12/110v Norcold Refrigerator that makes ice in 110 deg. weather
sink and 3 way water (hand pump, electric pump (aftermarket replacement)
and city water)
Holding tank
Coleman LPG forced air furnace w/ thermostat (thermostat is aftermarket
replacement)
Cup holder that attaches to dash
cushioned box between front seats
Aux. battery w/ relay and condition meter
110/12v converter
Blaupunkt AM radio (stock)
CB radio w/  collapsible 108&quot; whip antenna (I've never seen another one
like it.)
Tow bar (non-stock)
Tool kit including Bilstein jack, lug wrench and tommy bar
Owners' handbooks for both the van and the camper conversion

New:
(4)LT27.00/8.50-14 tires
(4) gas shocks (NAPA lifetime warranty)
1 piece exhaust (NOT Monza)
recent tune including Points, condensor, plugs (all Bosch), valve adjustment
Front brakes
Shift coupler (urethane)
Van battery (50 mo. interstate)

Needs:
Minor body work on l/r fender lip
Rock damage in windshield (usable as-is but really S/B replaced)
Rear bumper banged up but there and solid
Upolstery is worn but no holes or rips
Door panels have been cut for 4&quot; speakers
Zipper on rear cushion needs repaired/replaced
Camper battery
Drivers side window channel (dog ate it...)

Color:
Blue w/ white poptop
Interior is Brown Plaid
Blue carpet in rear

I also have a pair of Vanagon seats available.  They are blue plaid.  They
match the exterior and look okay with the brown interior.  Drivers seat is
a slip in, passenger seat will need adjustment tracks attached to floor
(and some fabrication.)

This van has spent its entire life in the following locales:
Purchased new in Spokane WA.
Next couple of owners lived in or around Boise ID
Next owner lived in Union, OR (near Pendleton) and drove it to Yuma and
Phoenix AZ a few times.
As far as I know, it has never been within 200 miles of the ocean and we
use sand, not salt on the roads here.  It is not pristine, though it is v.
good.

Looking for offers around $4200.
