Subject: 84 engine advice

Tried to send this before and apparently my attachment didn't work.  It
looked ugly on my screen anyway so I'll try again.

A mechanic that I've had good luck with says that rebuilding this vintage
engine (84) is pretty much not an option.  Actually, he said no one in their
right mind would do it.  

So has anyone not in their right mind had any experience with this subject or
know anyone who has?  Any major engine work advice would be appreciated.

Thanks
