Subject: Extra Storage Space

I solved a problem and thought I's share it:

On the sliding door side of my Westy, there is a space underneath about
48&quot; long, 14&quot; wide and 4&quot; deep.  This is the same space used for the
propane tank on the other side of the van. Well at our local W**l M**t,
they sell a plastic gun case for $Cdn 17.48 (~$US 13) and it measures
48&quot; long, 12&quot;wide and 4&quot; deep. EUREKA. Two custom made brackets and a
shock cord and the deed is done.  Now my jack, air pump, towing rope,
hand buck saw and hatchet now longer use up space under the back seat.

Can you think of a better use for a gun case?
