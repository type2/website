Subject: Mud flaps for 83.5

Hello

Just spoke the dealer to get a price on replacing the lost front mud flaps on
my 83.5 Westy. $99 each!! We both had a good laugh. (Although I've got to say
he seemed to enjoy it more than me.)
 Does anyone know of a supplier that has them at a lower price?

TIA
Jeff
