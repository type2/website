Subject: Attn eastern PA folks!

Hi!

Anyone interested in doing some shopping for me?  Guy on r.a.vw.a-c posted
a '79 bus for sale last week that sounds like it might be up my alley.
Unfortunately, the bus is in Bethlehem, PA and I'm in Cleveland, OH.  Not a
problem if I buy it, but makes checking it out a little tough.  Would love
it if someone would check it out and give an honest opinion on it.

Any volunteers?

Bill
