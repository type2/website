Subject:      price check on 85 westie

Hey Folks-
        I need some advice on a price on an 85 westie I'm thinking of
buying.  It is a 85 Gl camper with 95,000 miles, auto tranny, and all
original engine(no head job, but a new waterpump and exhaust).  The engine
has no apparent leaks and the PO keep pretty good records of the work she
did to it.  One negative is that I found a bottle of cheap coolant in one of
the cabinets.  It had phosphate (sp?)in it.  The overflow tank was full to
the right place and the oil was clean.  The interior is very nice and it
drives ok ( alot slower than an 86 auto though, is that normal?).  The best
part is the body.  It was a California van until moving to the northeast 3
years ago.  The body is not perfect but very good with only a spot here or
there, no seams etc.  My question is how does $6200 sound for it?
        Thanks in advance for any info.
Thanks,
Stephen Davis
