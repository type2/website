Subject: Re: Top Speed

I went to buy a '72 Westy once and the thing was insane. Nothing worked, 
not the electric gauges, lights, the only thing that did work was the 
speedo. This thing was a total bondo unti except for the fact that 
someone had put a serious rebuilt engine in it. I was travelling across the 
freeway riding the bumper of a 300zx (in the fast lane) at 90 mph. I 
don't know what the heck had been done to the engine. Didn't buy the van 
for $1200 CDN because of the shape the body was in. My '77 Westy with a 
fresh rebuilt 2.0l engine got up to 85 mph while traveling this summer on 
level ground.
