Subject: cv ball bearing   Greg Schmidt writes: Hello All,   I have
  lost one of the shiny metal ball bearings from my CV joint!!  
  Somewhere between the driveway and my shop (back porch), it must have 
  fallen out.   The CVs are in fine shape.  Can I just put another ball
  in  there, or am I SOL?   Anybody have a spare CV ball bearing? 

I once was confronted with a similiar situation. In my early experiences
with VW's I had endeavored to repack my cv's. Having little experience with
this filthy project, I became extremely frustrated when I was unable to put
the last ball-bearing back in the cage. Every time I put the last one in,
another would pop out. After about an hour of this I became so angry that I
threw the axle down on the asphalt driveway resulting in ball-bearings
flying everywhere including the adjoining woods! Needless to say after
realizing my foolishness, I searched for the balls. And of course I found
all but one! So I went to the local junkyard bought a used cv and replaced
the ball. Not the best thing to do but it was the cheapest. So Greg I for
one have spare cv ball-bearings.
