&gt;I stopped by Sears today and found out that they make a Diehard Gel Marine
&gt;battery that is type 27, 12&quot;L x 6 13/16&quot;W x 9 7/16&quot;H.  Does anyone know if
&gt;this will fit under the drivers' seat in a 1990 Vanagon?

Not sure about the Gel version. For the non-gel version, the &quot;old&quot; style,
such as that sold until a couple of years ago, will fit. The current style
will not.

Consider instead the Exide (available in Marine stores &amp; elsewhere) group
27--the cheaper of the two models; it will fit like the old Sears did.

Both require that the right rear corner of the swivel base be rounded off in
order for the driver's seat to be able to swivel inwards without hitting the
battery vent covers.

Manny batteries with a flat top will no fit. The batteries that fit tend to
have only the vent covers protruding above the surface of the battery. The
vent covers are actually taller than swivel base of the seat, but with the
trimming mentioned in the paragraph above, the swivel seat base misses these
covers. 

The main problem with my setup is that it is a hydrogen factory until I rig
up some external venting for the 27 on the drivers side. That is, the
battery sticks up into the vehicle interior. It is hidden under the rug
mostly, but the hydrogen produced by charging goes directly into the cabin
(remember the hindenburg?). Still, at the low charging voltage selected by
VW for the Vanagon, there is considerably less hydrogen produced than with
many American cars. I've been driving around like this for four years and
everything has been OK but I hope to rig up an external vent within the next
year or so.

&gt;Also, is a 'marine' battery the same as a 'deep-cycle' battery?

Essentially.
