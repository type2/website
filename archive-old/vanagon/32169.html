&gt;It must be diesel week at the Munro household.
&gt;
Then last night my wife found an
&gt;ad in the local Nickel Ads for an '82 Vanagon Diesel that needed a clutch. $750
&gt;
&gt;We went and checked it out today.  The body is straight, the interior is
&gt;perfect.  Starts and runs just fine.  It's currently owned by a pastor who
&gt;has lots of receipts, an extra injector pump, an extra head, and some VW
&gt;tools.  I asked lots of questions and he wasn't struck my lightening during
&gt;the conversation.  It was rebuilt by a very competent local shop 30,000
&gt;miles ago.
&gt;
&gt;While I need a diesel Vanagon like I need a size 11 boot up my butt, these
&gt;vehicles are the easiest of all to put a non-wasserboxer motor in.  I plan
&gt;on putting a gasoline Jetta/Rabbit motor in it.  I will keep anyone posted
&gt;who is curious on how it goes.
&gt;
&gt;In the process of checking out alternate motors for our '79 Westy, I had
&gt;determined that the Rabbit/Jetta motor would be a great choice (after
&gt;wearing out two Rabbits, I'm convinced there is no engine with more zippy
&gt;miles per dollar than a Rabbit motor.  They are cheap, and plentiful.

Hi Alex,
     Sounds like you got yourself a great deal.  I have a diesel Westy
myself.  When I bought it the motor was spent so I did the Rabbit
convertion myself.  I'll tell you now if the diesel running good, keep it
for now. It may be slow but its simple, reliable and great 30mpg no matter
how hard you drive it.  The convertion is as simple as changing the motor.
Its the fuel Injection thats gets to be a problem.  Just about any in-line
VW motor will fit you Vanagon.  Write me if you need help.  If you do
decide to do the convertion, Use a motor out of a newer VW, 88 and newer.
The FI is accually easier to work with.  Its very similar to Watercooled
Vanagons.  I think they are easier to work on anyway. Right now I've got an
83 GTI motor installed with the stock CIS injection and I'm having problems
with it.  I thinking of going back to a diesel motor.  But I want one from
a Golf or Jetta Turbo diesel.  Same HP as gas with MPG like diesel.Good
luck!
