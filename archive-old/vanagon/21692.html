Subject:  re:FFFF/ My brother became one of them! :( 

Jonathan expostulated:

&gt;We have failed as a family.  It seems that my brother has been 
brainwashed
&gt;and accepted into a cult.  :(
&gt;
&gt;I was informed that my brother and his wife bought a 1996 american
&gt;minivan[1] on Wednesday.  They were last seen going on a vacation.
&gt;
&gt;[1] Company and model withheld to protect sensitive list readers.  (It 
has 
&gt;a five sided logo on it)

Now, I have an '89 version of one of those, and they're not *quite* that 
bad.  Mind, nobody's ever flashed me a peace sign because of it.... 
'Course, the '72 Westy doesn't have air conditioning; you win some, and 
you lose some.

Dave O'Heare (whose former '71 bus had a song written about it -- don't 
think the Plym*th will ever be famed in story or song)
