Subject: Re: Stupid Hubcap question for '74 Westy

Mark E. White asked &quot;hubcaps.  How do you put them on without putting a 
big dent in them.&quot;

  I don't know how serious you are about this, but I saw a guy at one of 
those multi million dollar antique auto exhibits puting on a hub cap and 
I had to ask what he had in his hand.  It was fascinating.  He said they 
sprayed the outside surface of the cap with mold release (silicon spray 
will do I think) and then made a partial mold of part of the outside 
surface using epoxey body puddy.  When it cures and is shaped to 
thick piece about a 5 inches long by an inch and a half wide cap mating 
surface, you have a non destructive way to load the hub cap with a rubber 
hammer's impact energy.
  Mine have the little dents you mentioned.

	Cheers,
