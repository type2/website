&gt;I'm sure that, like me, many of you have made your Bus your home. At one
&gt;time, it might have been your only domicile ( I lived in my camper for
&gt;two years while working at IBM: much nicer and more flexible than most
&gt;studio apartments...and did I mention *cheap* ? )
&gt;Where did you park?
&gt;Best results for me were achieved at apartment complexes--preferably of
&gt;the student variety: less cops, people don't know all their neighbors'
&gt;cars....
&gt;Do you have better suggestions?

if you are a student or can get a parking decal from the college, you could
park it in the building parking lots. i knew a fellow who lived in his 71
camper while getting his masters in biology. the problems were:
- no electrical hookups.
- no water hookups.
- had to maintain a valid parking decal (or get a ticket)
- had to move the bus every other day (or cops got suspicious)
- used biology/chem.engineering labs for toilet/showers (they had shower
  facilities; and the housecleaning crew didn't mind)
- loud parties from the fraternities behind the biology building.

it WAS cheap, but he didn't recommend it.
