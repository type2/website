Subject: Bye for now, 86 Vent window fix

Hi all. Siegfried is going on vacation for three weeks and I'll be with
him. It is off to Canada, so we'll let you know how it goes when we get
back. Now, the 86 vent window fix - Take off the panel and find the
attachment for the vent window. Now using a mirror locate the big part of
the screw. I used a pair of needle nose vise grips and grasp the screw.
Clamp the vise grips on. Turn the screw Towards the FRONT of the car.
Turning the other way will unscrew the screw and you. I tightened the screw
so that Hercules himself has to turn it. But, the vent will stay open!!
        Hey, good summer all, be back around the 24th or so!
        Mike Elkavitch
