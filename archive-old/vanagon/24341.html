Yes, it actually moved out of the garage!  I set the valves again, etc
and fired it up.  I let it warm a little and set to adjusting the 
carb.  I figured out I can't reach any of the adjustment screws with 
the motor running for fear of frying myself on the coil.  This I will 
have to work on.  First stop was the gas station since I had drained 
the tank and only put in 2 gallons.  Then it was off to pick up a 
couple of friends.  They really couldn't believe it either.  I ran it 
around town for a leisurely 25 miles and then back to the garage and 
dumped the oil.  It still has some of that break-in oil stuff giving 
the oil a funny color.  I did a few of the run it up to speed and then
back off the gas deals.  I started to explain to my friends about 
pulling oil past the rings and such, blank stares.  Oh well.  Oh, I 
did install the new throttle cable too but it didn't help matters much
with the sticking.  I then took the old flaps spring and ran it 
between the end of the throttle arm and hooked it on the air cleaner. 
Voila.  Works a treat.  I will see about drilling the fan housing to 
move the tube when I have the motor out in about 500 miles.  Great to 
be back behind the wheel again.  Jim
