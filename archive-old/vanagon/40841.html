Vanagon,

Please send information to Bob &amp; Midge (UAEY76A_at_prodigy) about your mailing
list.
Don Woolard tells me it is a great source of informaiton. I do not own a
Vanagon, but Midge (my mother) and Bob do. I have passed your address along
to them. Please cc me just for reference.

Thanks
Bruce Bean
