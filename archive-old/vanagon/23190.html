Finally saw Shank Shaw Redemption. Yeah I know, I'm only about 24 months
behind but who cares. The Tim Roberts protagonist is putting together a
library with new found books. Right on the top of the stack that the
characters are sorting is &quot;Fix Your Volkswagen&quot; the smallish book with a tan
cover and brown lettering. copyright 1962-ish?

Saw some funky alien (with a jones for paparika) eating humans in coffee
houses in order to survive thing on Showtime last night. Young she charcter
drives the alien who happens to look like a hunky type around in a '59-'62
two-toned ragtopped type 1. Stars &quot;Worf&quot; as a fedcop, Stacey Keach and a
bunch of unknowns. Nice bug/stock. Insider StarTrek jokes at Worfs' expense.
Bug was left sitting outside without J club, alarm or concern that the bad
boys from Garden Grove/Compton would strip it and take the parts to the next
Pamona. ;)

Entertainment Tonight (Entertainment Lastnight?):
Story about &quot;TieDyed&quot; a psuedo documentary about Deadheads but not the Dead.
Cool poster with Safari windowed Deady-Splitty bus. Supposed scenes
dedicated to the Deadheads various modes of transportation. To be released
in theaters soon.
