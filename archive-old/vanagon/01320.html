&gt; &gt;Ralf and Jim work on their buses,
&gt; &gt;Wearing panties and a braaaaar,
&gt; &gt;Neither one of them has much money,
&gt; &gt;so their clothes are be-low par.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Mike went camping in the mountains
&gt; &gt;Where the 4 by 4's do roam.
&gt; &gt;Viscious critters ate his brake lines,
&gt; &gt;Had to drag a log back home.
&gt; 
&gt; Ric's had dozen veedubs or more
&gt; And 4 or 5 still on Mars 

  4 or 5 hung out at bars
  4 or 5 circling the stars 

&gt; Suprised his wallets' not more sore,
&gt; &gt;From all those little cars.
&gt; 
&gt; Alright.  Not Mars, but you try to find a ryhme for 'cars'.
&gt; I *wish* it was Friday now.  I can hear my bus a-callin'.
&gt; :-)

This is getting REALLY sad.  I think it's plain to see
why it's a drinking song....   ;)
