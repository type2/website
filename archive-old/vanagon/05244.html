Subject: VW Bus Trans Tools

I have for sale the VW385 transmission rebuilding set of tools for rebuilding
VW Bus, VW Fox, VW Dasher, Beetle, Type 411/312, Audi 4000, Audi Coupe, Audi
5000 (except Quattro), Audi 100, Fox, Audi 80. (Not Vanagon)

This set is comprised of dozens of pieces with a total dealer price (the
price the *dealer* has to pay) in excess of $3,000. One piece alone, the
measuring bar, costs a dealer $1,101. From the looks of this set, it has
never been used. These are some of the most beautifully machined parts I have
ever seen. These are official factory Volkswagen tools direct from germany.

I am offering to sell this set for $690 or best offer if I am swamped with
buyers before I sell. I will also consider trading this set to a transmission
repair shop for work on my Vanagon Syncro transmission. 

Walk into a transmission repair shop with these tools and watch their mouths
drop open and immediately drop any transmissions they are holding onto the
floor...
