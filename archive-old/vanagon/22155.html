Subject: Blown Engine - Replacement

	Yesterday my 86 vanagon threw part of a connecting rod through the
top of the case.  Engine still has plenty of oil in the case, so the failure 
mode is unknown.  Happened in 4th gear while crusing about 60.  Strange...

	Am in the market for a RUNNING 2.1 liter; recent total?, rebuilt?

	Has anyone put an air-cooled 2.0 liter into a water-cooled Vanagon?

	Any ideas?

Am located in Auburn, AL (2 hours sw from Atlanta, GA)
