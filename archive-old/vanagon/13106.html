Subject: Gotz me zum EuroFan Tires...


When I last left the little tire saga I had contacted Tire Rack
and they told me that I could get some Michelin MXLs for the 
EV, but I would have to wait 3 weeks or so for Michelin to release
the tires. So I called my local Michelin dealer, who said they
could get them...at $130 a pop!!

Maybe not bad, but Tire Rack quoted me $85/tire with shipping!!! So
I think I'll wait the three weeks.

BTW, thanks for all of the suggestions, etc. regarding tires, etc.

Ric
