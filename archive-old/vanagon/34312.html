Subject: Re(2): wasserboxer oil buzzer warning = Fram

Regarding the oil light/buzzer on wasserboxers;

Mine has done this for years.  In all cases it occurs after extended high
speed driving (~65 mph).  When you start to slow down, as for a toll booth, it
will go off.  I depress the clutch, tap the accelerator adn it goes away.  I
may have to do this 3-4 (sometimes more) while driving at slower speeds after
the high speed run.  Then it goes away.  It actually hasn't happened in the
last year.  (And will not right now, since I'm still saving $$ to replace a
seized up tranny!! :(

I never noticed an effect from oil level.  I have rarely had VW filters on;
right now I believe I have a Lee Maxi filter.  Anyone had experience with
these?  Some FLAPS dealer promoted these over Fram.
