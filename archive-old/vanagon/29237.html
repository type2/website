I was reading with interest the thread on the noisy speedo.  My '87 Westy
has the same problem and I've tried numerous times to cure it with no
success.  I will try to rotate the cable as suggested and see what that
does.  This replacement cable that was mentioned is coming from where ? 
If that is the solution I'd like to try it.    Always something to keep
us Vanagon owners occupied !

Cheers

Frank
