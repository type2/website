A lot of people advertise Wasserboxer rebuilds now days in DB&amp;HVWS, One Stop MAcining 
(310)923-6748 $1095, Fast German (310)679-2801 $1599, Audirac VW's (619)727-1827 $1495, 
and finally AVP (800)548-5766 in the $1600 range last I called.  Of these AVP has an OK 
rep on the list from people who toured their shop, has been in business a long time, 
some of the others have just appeared recenly in the mag at least.  Call these people 
see what you feel from them, certainly you can do much better than $3500, and don't be 
afraid to pull this thing and swap it yourself, truth be told a Wasserboxer is just a 
big bug engine, and without engine tin to deal with, is really OK to change.
