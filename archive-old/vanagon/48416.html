My cluster only has the two back brackets broken. You know, the ones
that hold the pod down tight against the dash. I haven't noticed any
broken brackets holding instruments themselves in. As to the brake
fluid issue, I fill mine myself using a small funnel (no spills that
way). I cannot speak for how the brake fluid was handled before I
bought my van, although I suspect the dealership serviced the van as
the couple who owned it were elderly and not mechanically inclined
(had service stamps in the book too).
