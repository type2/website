Subject: Looking for Joseph Rayle

I got the following message from my listserv, and it contained NO outside 
e-mail address.  This means that he didn't even get an error message for 
his attempt to subscribe.  Has anyone else ever gotten e-mail from Joesph 
Rayle and could send me his address?   
Please send it to me and not to the list.

Thanks!
