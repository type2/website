Subject: My engine has the shakes

Hi all,

I have my engine running again after a head job (yeah!), so now I can begin to
think about details.  One of these is the amount of jumping about my engine
does.  Does this mean I need new motor mounts, or what else can I do to calm
this baby down?  BTW, it's an 85 w/ 150K.

Thanks again,

David
