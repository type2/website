&gt;I doubt that the water pump could stop pumping unless the impeller
&gt;is breaking apart, and you'd probably hear that. I could buy the
&gt;over-heating due to a stuck t-stat though. Another possibility is
&gt;that your heads are leaking combustion pressure into the cooling
&gt;system. I hope that it's something simpler than that though.

All in favor of Brads diagnosis say &quot;AYE&quot;

All owners of said vehicle please say &quot;AIEEE&quot;

The pumps can lose capacity through cavitation/erosion of the impellor fins,
happens slowly though.  Bad thermostat..?  should consistently overheat.  Tim
