Alan,
Same here, but I used Maguiers 1-2-3 step, clean, polish and wax. Took
several days (actually, a couple of weeks) to finish (yesterday) the 90
Carat, boy, what a gorgeous tornado red van!!! But even with the third
step wax I was still getting dead paint on the applicator. Sure it's hard
work, but the results make ya proud...
