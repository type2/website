&gt;2) High Beams occasionally stick &quot;on&quot;.

Get a good wiring diagram and continuity tester. Check the wiring and
condition
of the turn signal switch on the column and the hi-beam relay.

i had the problem of the highbeams working, but the lows would sometimes
quit.  It got to where i only  drove with the highbeams on,   which
unaccountably annoyed other people.   - It turned out that the headlight
switch had failed  (73 bus)
