&gt; 	For a starting project, I wanna paint my hubcaps - anybody done this 
&gt; before?  They are chrome now, but dingy.  I wanna go for the authentic
&gt; early look...

I painted all the chrome on my old '76 white to match the roof, as
it was getting bad, I stongly reccomend sandblasting the chrome off
then PPG epoxy primer (can't remember the number) but even a good
cleaning with Acrlyiclean then maybe some steel wool to give tooth
before the epoxy primer would be sufficient, that stuff sticks to
anything even glass.  Results were very nice on mine, no flaking or
peeling in 2+ years but I did sandblast.
