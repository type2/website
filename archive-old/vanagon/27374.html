&gt;My understanding, or thought was that the GL had all the power equipment
&gt;standard (power windows, door locks, stereo, power mirrors, AC, cruise, and
&gt;so on) plus metallic paint, a fancier interior etc.  If the GL has the sink
&gt;and stove, and the plain camper does not, what is a weekender......... a
&gt;standard camper?


A weekender just has a bed but not appliances.  Also, the diff between a GL
and regular differs.  Not all years even had power mirrors.  Also, in the
Vanagons, the regular camper also had appliances (not just the GL).
A few GL items are velour interior, padded dash, power steering, AC??,
maybe cassette?.  I have a factory matching mat (rubber with rug on top)
for my middle area that is factory.  I may remember a few things later.
Oh, also, my GL is beige (factory) but I think all the metallics started
hitting with the '86s or '87s.



&gt;Did Weekenders come in pop tops and non poptops?

Yes.

Is a Weekender a variation on the Westfalia?
see my first paragraph.


&gt;I thought I was getting somewhere, but it appears I'm helplessly confused.

Welcome to the fold brother!



With all the engine problems(leaks), hesitation, finicky emissions,
outrageous prices over blue book, ($16500 for ANY VEHICLE WITH 125,000 mi is
robbery, yet I've seen it paid for a 90 Westy), marginally working
refrigerators and air conditioners, little to no power, bad handling,
expensive parts...... I'm starting to think looking for a Westy is NUTS!!!
 Maybe a Ford Econoline with a good old reliable straight six, and all the
aftermarket camper junk is the way to go???


Well now, ya didn't have to resort to obscenity!  You're right in that
that price is robbery.  Keep looking.  BTW, my emissions are fine (they
VET test here), no oil leaks, hesitation?, bad handling?  ---no way!
Ok well....expensive parts is a factor.  Also, please don't use the
F-word here... it's like saying the Madonna-word in front of the pope.
