I just changed mine for the second time in a little less than a year.  The
parts place finally gave me back 50% of the cost of the new one the other
day after many calls.  I have heard there is a problem with these pumps
and from looking at how they are built I can see why !  Someone on this
list mentioned at one time about pumps made in Italy being good ones.  I
have yet had the opportunity to check this out myself, I'm hoping the one
I just put in there will last a bit longer !  I've got it down to about a
two hour job, not tooooo complicated.  One thing to keep in mind after
insalling your new pump is to not OVERTIGHTEN the belt,  These skimpily
made pumps can not take much tension before failing.  Good luck

Cheers 

Frank
