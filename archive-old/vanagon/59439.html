Subject: Wanna &quot;cruise&quot; into the sunset

Would anyone of you who is parting out buses happen to have a cruise
control assembly (all the pieces) that would work on my '90 Westfalia?

I intend to be skydiving most of the summer if I can bring myself to quit
my job. That means I'll be crisscrossing the country several times from one
competition to the next.  Personally my foot gets to aching after being
propped up at the toe end for so long in the van.

Really, any help would be appreciated including the name of someone in the
NY, NJ, CT area that might be able to install it.

Regards,  -Clark
