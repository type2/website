&gt;My 84 Vanagon's 4-speed 091/1 Tranny is needing an output shaft (I'd call 
&gt;it a pilot shaft) and VW wants about $80 for one.  I noticed in the 
&gt;latest 'How VWs' that SAW makes them.  Since I doubt SAW sells their 
&gt;products retail, I was wondering if anyone out there might know how much 
&gt;SAW is asking for this critters before I call Barrett's or one of the 
&gt;other aftermarket retailers.

The shaft you need is called the input shaft.  When rplacing the pilot
bearing, be sure to replace the little felt washer that keeps the cluth dust
out of the bearing.  It is available throughyour dealer,(about $1.00).  Some
repalcement bearings include a lip seal.  You should still instal the felt as
the dust will eat the lip seal anyway.  For the shaft, try calling Weddle
Engineering at 310-598-2731.
