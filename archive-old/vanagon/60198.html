Subject: tires


Hello all,

I'm looking for a new set of tires for my 84' Westy, and need some advice on
what to get.  The tires that are currently on my Westy are 185 R14, each one
is from a different manufacture.  I call a few places and was told that the
185 R14 is really a 195/75 14.  Is this the best size to go with??  Who is
the best manufacture of tires for the Westy (yes I am on a budget)?  Also,
both of the front tires have worn tread on the inside top edge of the tire.
Is this due to the alignment being off or is it a more serious problem? 
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Mike D.
