&gt;	Does anyone have a recomendation on a source for the
&gt;large, rectangular, cargo-hatch locks that go on the under-bed
&gt;doors of my single-cab? They match up to a door-style striker,
&gt;and appear to be a unique part. Both were locked when I bought
&gt;the truck and I had to drill one out for access. :-(

I thought they were the same as for the early engine lid latch mechanisms -
does it take a church key?  Or how about the early hatch mechanism?

I have one of each of these laying around somewhere.
