Subject: Cam type?

Ok Vdub slueth puppies...Gotta real stumper for you.

The recent 67 Westie aquisition came with what appeared to be a older
stock 40hp shortblock sitting on the floor of the camper. Last night I
decided to tear it down hoping to find a worthy 0/0 crank with which
to base a rebuild around. Low and behold, it DID yeild a 0/0 crank which
mic'd out within .002... Good cranks are hard to come by these days!

Now, onto the question of the week.

Upon extraction I noticed the cam gear appeared a bit different from the
dozen or so I have laying on my shop shelves. While it was a 3-rivet type
the oil-pump recess cavity looked deeper and dished (like the later 5-rivet
cams) and nowhere on it did it proclaim VW or mention the part number (113.)

What it does have:

Stamped on the back face of the cam gear:  LMB
                                            ^
Stamped on the front face of the cam gear: /S\*
                                           ---
Embossed on the cam length: Made in Germany HO1, 2-PN-10
Embossed on the inside gear: 2 **
                             ``

I haven't measured the lobes, or checked duration, by eyeballing it though it
looks a bit more drastic than stock!!!

* a bad ascii representation of a letter &quot;S&quot; within a cam shape!
** the back slashes are actually under umlaut dots!

Wouldn't be a scarce Okrasa Cam would it?  ;-)  (wink, wink, nudge, nudge)
