&gt;My mother has a recently purchased '87 Vanagon Wolfsburg Ed. There is a
&gt;noticable and uncomfortable draft of warm air comming from under the dash.
&gt;I haven't seen the van, but she claims to be turning off all of the heater
&gt;controls. This is more and more annoying as temperatures rise in mid
&gt;summer.

It is likely that she has NOT turned off the heater controls.  They can be
confusing for new owners.  The levers work like this:


The WINDSHIELD AIR FLOW is controlled by the top (#1) lever.  Left is closed,
right is open. (There's a little windshield symbol attempting to depict
this.)

The AIR TEMPERATURE is controlled by the 2nd lever.  Left is no heat, right
is maximum heat.

The FOOTWELL AIR FLOW is controlled by the 3rd lever.  Left is open, right is
closed.
(There's a little arrow pointing down, implying air DOWN there)

The REAR CEILING AIR FLOW is controlled by the bottom (#4) lever.  Left is
open, right is closed.  Rear ceiling air is not heated.  (Again, there's a
little picture trying to convey this.)

The DASH AIR FLOW is controlled directly on each dash vent.  Up is closed,
down is open.  Dash air is NOT heated in 87 &amp; older vans.  Dash air can be
heated (lever #2) on 88 &amp; newer vans.

The DOOR &quot;VENTS&quot; are air exit vents that allow air to exit the van when
opened.  Forward is open, rearward position is closed.  (This applies only to
87 &amp; older vans.  88 &amp; newer have air exits at the back end of the rear-side
windows that are allways open)

Colors are used in the vent symbols as follows: Blue is cold.  Red is hot.
 White is variable from cold to hot.  Thus the rear ceiling vent symbol is
blue, depicting that only cold air is available there.

All of these air vent controls operate independently except that closing one
air outlet will naturally cause more air to flow from the open vents.

Note that NONE of the levers control as an &quot;OR&quot; function like: left for dash
air - OR - right for foot air.  They are all just simple open &amp; close of one
device only.

There are no &quot;Recirculate&quot; controls.  If you want air flow, it must come in
from outside the van.  If you want NO air flow, just close each vent
independently.

I hope this helps.
