Subject: Re: brake warning light

After reading Joel's And Sami's responses on the question of brake 
warning light function, it appears we have covered all the bases, but 
this has raised further questions in my feeble brain.

First, as someone who has experienced a brake circuit failure (on the 
Super Beetle), if that little light comes on, stop driving (if you can).
Half-brakes will not stop you in  any safe distance.  You are better off 
driving with the oil light on.  That only kills the car.

After I read in Bently that the light was supposed to come on during 
starter operation (which it didn't), I went on a morning long test search 
with my VOM to make sure that it was functioning correctly.  All systems 
seemed normal, but I like my brakes &quot;by the book&quot;, so I went to VW and 
bought a new replacement ($78).  The new one functioned in exactly the 
same manner as the old one, so I took the car to the dealership, 
whereupon I was told the test for '78's was only &quot;light on for parking 
brakes&quot;.  A long night with the schematic, and a close examination of the 
light assembly (which is quite stuffed with circuitry) convinced me this 
was so.

Does anyone know the dividing lines in years for the different test modes?

Does anyone else have a &quot;light on during start&quot;?
