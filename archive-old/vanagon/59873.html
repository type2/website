&gt;I was wondering if anyone knew what the dot markings on the speedometer
&gt;mean. This is in an 83 WB. There are dots at certain points. There is
&gt;one dot at 20, two dots at 40, and three at 65. Are these supposed to be
&gt;the top speeds for each gear? My westy would be screaming at 50 in third
&gt;gear, and 20 in first....forget about it. My Westy doesn't have a tach
&gt;(yet) so usually use the st muir guide of 10, 20, 40 when driving. What
&gt;speed/rpms do other people shift at? Thanks.

according to the 83 WB owners manual:
&quot;after the break-in period, the following speeds should not be exceeded:
Manual transmission
Gear     after 1500km
  1         25km/h      (15mph)
  2         50km/h      (30mph)
  3         80km/h      (48mph)
  4         top speed   (imho: about 80 mph :)

in the OLD models of vws, they had little &quot;bars&quot; that marked the shift mph ...
not dots. i don't know what the dots are.

i generally shift like this: (shift OUT of the gear):
1st    after rolling, at or less than 10 mph.
2nd    about 25-30mph
3rd    about 40-50mph
4th    :)  i wish i did have a 5th gear sometimes!!

3rd gear is the most commonly used one for me, from about 25 to 50 mph, around
town.
