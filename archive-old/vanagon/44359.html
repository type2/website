Subject: '84 Westfalia

I just bought an '84 though think the engine may be clapped out. Compression
reads 175/175/150/120. Will be driving down the West Coast from Vancouver to
Mazatlan shortly? If my worst fears are realised I'll have to replace the
engine.

Is it possible to get a new engine meeting CA emission standards in Mexico?
Ballpark price. What's the US price? (approx). Here in the land of monopoly
money it's about CAN$4000. Any help really appreciated. Please post or reply
to gmilne_at_intergate.bc_dot_ca

Thanks
