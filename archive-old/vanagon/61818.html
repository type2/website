Subject: Cruise control problem stumps dealer

Folks:

I recently bought a '91 Carat with a non-working cruise control.  The
PO didn't know when it had died, as he lived in the mountains and had
little use for it.  I'm currently a flatlander, and I'd like to get it
working again.

I've taken it to my local VW dealer several times, and they're stumped.
All of the test procedures pass.  The pump, when shorted, actuates the
control arm properly.  They've talked to the VW technical support
folks, to no avail.  They have a second Vanagon with what they believe
is an identical failure, and they've even tried replacing the $500
control unit on that one.  No dice.

Anyone have any suggestions about what else to try?  Has anyone else
had a similar experience?  Are there any common failure modes to this
CC?

I know that I could replace it with an aftermarket unit, but I'd like
to get the OEM one working.  I had a similar CC on an old Quattro, and
I really liked it.  It was very precise and accurate (when it wasn't
leaking, anyway).
