Subject: Volks-motorsports Sever Problem/ Move!

Listees,

  Just wanted to touch base and let you know about a few things;

  I've been having some problems with my server, and also with some of the search 
engines pointing to my Old URL!  I've been incontact with the different search engines 
and also my server.  For the most part I think that these problems are solved but that 
always changes too in the web world:)

  I am also moving at the end of the month, this means that my phone # will change.  
I'll have the new # on the web site and in my sig file but for those of you reading 
right now that want the New # it is, (408)429-9424.  Only the prefix has changed but 
that's enough to cause a problem!

  The good news is that I'll be moving 2 blocks from the shop and I have enough room 
to park any Listmembers Vans that want a place to stay while in Santa Cruz :). When 
Charlie stopped by I had to point him toward the best &quot;Street Location&quot;  Not 
anylonger!

  &quot;Thanks for letting me ramble&quot;

  Kyle
