&lt;&lt; Is there an aftermarket source of some sort of jalousie louvres (like on
my
 72 Westy) that can fit over the sliding window on the 89 Westy?
 
 Also: is there a retrofit window that can fit in the rear side windows to
 be able to open them, like the side swing window on the 72 Westy?
  &gt;&gt;

I know a guy named Ron Maxon who has an show cond. '83.5 Westy (Ron, are you
on the list??) and took a set of Jalosie windows from a Baywindow and framed
them out w/ aluminum to match the bigger Vanagon window opening. I did a
doubletake the first time I saw them. I thought it was a factory option it
was so professionally done!!!

I'll see if I can get his number. He's the guy who's putting on the LiMBO
sponsored &quot;Westies in the Woods&quot; campout next month near the Jersey shore. If
you get LiMBO, his ad is on the back page.
