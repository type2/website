Off the top of my head I remember reading 5-10 HP can be pulled from a
auto a/c, but looking at the other stuff up there that might be wrong.

If you have 130HP then 10 HP isnt such a terrible price to pay .

I think the problem with the Peltier approach is you have to ship
100's amps around the car in a way that Joe/Jane Citizen wont kill
themselves with it, not so much the thermo of the problem, but there
still are lots of things to look into here before giving up ....
