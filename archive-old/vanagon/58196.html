Subject: next CCC's location


Here's the location suggestions for the next CCC's.  I've saved them
from before Ron started up the list, and after, so should have most
nominations.  We can talk about dates another time.  Anyway:

Mariposa (near Yosemite), possibly on BLM land
Pfeiffer/Big Sur
Del Valle (near Livermore)
Memorial Park (San Mateo)
Big Basin (south, south bay)
Ventana Wilderness (south-east of Big Sur, vaguely)
Refugio (1/2 way between S.F. and L.A. near ocean)


We should decide soon - many are hankering to go again.  

Food for thought:  since our wagens are from the Vaterland, how about
a German culinary theme for next time?  Start cooking.
