All this discussion reminds me of the song from Kinky Friedman and
the Texas Jewboys (I belive)...

We're red necks...
We're red necks...
We don't know our ass from a hole in the ground...


or was it..

&quot;Git yer biskets in the oven, and yer buns in bed&quot;?


What does this have to do winh VWs? Damned if I know!  ;-)
