Can you tell us what led you to add the resistor? Is there some electronic
stuff here that you've actually figured out?  Why 500 ohms? Isn't that 
500 ohms in addition to the resistance of the thermistor? Joel reported
that _replacing_ his temperature sensor improved his surging, but this is
the first I've heard of the resistor solution.  Also, where did you mount
the resistor?  Did you just solder the wire to it and tape it up and let
it hang, or did you actually mount it somewhere? 

Thanks!
