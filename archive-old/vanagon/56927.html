Subject: Power Steering Puddle

Greetings:
After following the process of purging old ATF fluid from the  system and
replacing with fresh per an archives plan, I now have a significant puddle
under the left boot of the steering rack--any suggestions as to what to look
at as I assess this new development?  I assume I sprung the leak while
&quot;turning the wheel from rack to rack while cranking the engine&quot;.  
I understand that replacement racks are expensive, and am hoping that there
is a failed seal or such that might be replaced as an alternative.
Thanks--
