Subject:  Questions-answers 


Ken Asked:

&gt;(I know it's heresy, but don't anybody start with me. It's my wife who has
&gt;questions about it. Questions such as:
&gt;
&gt;--Why is this thing so loud?
Because the sewing machine is stuck in 'zig-zag'.

&gt;--Why is this shifting thing so mushy?
The linkages are 12ft long, and weigh more than an RX-7

&gt;--Why aren't you out there working on my Honda?
Honda's break? Ahha! so much for that myth.

&gt;--Could you put air conditioning in this?
Tighten your seatbelt, and open the 'no-draft' windows as far as they go.
keep your mouth closed or your lungs will over-inflate.

&gt;--What's wrong with it THIS time?)
Nothing a little roadside engine overhaul can't fix.
Here clean up these valve seats with your nail file for me.
