&gt;&gt; Why does the list use the message poster in REPLY TO and not the list?  I
&gt;&gt; haven't seen any of my posts, and realized when compared to another list
&gt;&gt; I'm on, the REPLY TO should be the list, not each individual poster, as
&gt;&gt; vanagon stuff is!
&gt;
&gt;This has been annoying me also.  Several times I've sent messages to
&gt;individuals instead
&gt;of the list (as I was intending) because I hit my ReplyTo button.

This is why Gerry configured it this way. Too many people were responding
to the list with what should have been messages to the sender. If you hit
the reply button without thinking, the whole list doesn't have to read it.
It has cut down on noise considerably.
