Subject: Re: How to Replace Tach Light??

&gt;The bulb is part of a black plastic holder that twists into place. These
&gt;may only be available at your dealer.
&gt;
The bulb pulls out of this holder, and costs $0.99 anywhere fine automobile 
components are sold.  Try this on an older Rabbit sometime, same bulb but it 
takes about 2 hours, to remove the instrument cluster, surrounding panel, 
fresh air duct, disconnect the speedo and wire harness. I kid you not. Just 
maybe VW learned something from this?   tim s.


PS: VW of Canada is dead! not to fear however, since we now answer to VWoA.
something akin to:   The King is dead,   Long live the King!
