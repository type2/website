     Joel,
     
     How about a stoopid statz by location?  
     
     I would be interested to know who the other 42 members are that live 
     in Northwest Portland with me.
     
     I think there must be twenty of them within a 2 block radius of me, 
     and I haven't met any of them.
     
     Take care yo' self.
