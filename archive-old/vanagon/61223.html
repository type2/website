&gt;   not from the case, but broke in half...thus breaking the seal &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; This is the first I've heard of this failure too.  Perhaps there would be
&gt; some use in installing those expensive Raceware studs during a rebuild or
&gt; head/gasket job?

      The long head bolds are Very Special. They act like springs
      to expand and contract with temperature. To replace them with
      anything else except the same thing would be a disaster. The
      reason this one broke, my guess would be, that it never had
      the head gaskets replaced, but it had the &quot;recall&quot;, whitch is
      over torching the head bolts.
