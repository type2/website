Subject: re: Sun Roof (85 Westy)

    I've got an 85 Westy, and I'm curious if anyone's every cut out
    the 'luggage rack' and installed a sunroof on one of these. I
    don't need the extra space, and it would make summer driving a
    hell of a lot better (no AC). Does this make any sense or is
    there some problem that I'm overlooking?

Interesting idea... Having just removed the 'rack' to replace the 
seal, I can comment on a few snags: Assuming you'd be cutting the 
shelf area out to make a hole - you'd need to extend the fiberglass 
sides of the shelf area down to meet the roof. The shelf sits about 
2&quot; above the metal of the roof. Also, having the sunroof sunken into 
the rack area may produce some weird turbulence at highway speeds. 

An interesting project would be to place the glass flush with the top surface
of the rack, then devise a way of sealing the opening in the roof and
the joint between roof/rack - effectively adding 6&quot; of headroom to
the cab area... 

I'm not sure if I'll use my rack or not, so I'll have to wait on this 
one...

I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
