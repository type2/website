Thanks Ric.  A reminder to everyone that it's better to think before you
hit 'send' than regret doing so later.

Oh, and I agree with your opinion on these magazines.  Though I once saw a

P.S.  It seems to be a universal law of the Internet that any posting
      correcting a spelling or grammar error itself contains an
      obvious and glaring error.
