Subject: Re: VW Alloy Wheels

&gt;If you upgrade to Alloy wheels for the 4 on the ground, what does that
&gt;mean for the spare? Can I simply continue to use the steel wheel that is the
&gt;standard spare, but with different bolts that spin on further?

When ordered new - a van that had the &quot;Carat&quot; style 5 spoke alloy wheels as an
option, came with the spare as an alloy too.

(Kenyon - check your spare on your burned westy)

THIS IS NOT NECESSARY, THOUGH. 

I drove that '87 Wolfsburg Ed. back from NYC on I-78 at speeds around 75 mph,
with 3 steel bus wheels, and one alloy wheel on the ground. 
It still handeled great. 
I used the alloy wheel lug bolts and nuts to put the steel wheels on with. 

So, it is not necessary to have an alloy wheel as a spare, as a steel one will
do the job just fine.
