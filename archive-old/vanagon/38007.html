I did this in my old '70 camper years ago.  The local specialty wood 
supplier had birch plywood in 5' x 5' sheets.

&gt;&gt; &lt;snip&gt; I prefer the plywood panels and trim in my old 71 
&gt;&gt; and am going to reproduce some panels using Baltic Birch or whatever 
&gt;&gt; light vernier plywood I can scrounge.
&gt;&gt;
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;, but one issue is that the headliner panel is slightly wider 
&gt;than 4', perhaps some German standard (?).  I know the hardware stores 
&gt;just carry 4'x8' or smaller; don't know about the speciality lumber 
&gt;stores.  &lt;snip&gt; &gt;I'd be interested in knowing if you find paneling in 
&gt;larger than 4'x8' sheets, though.
