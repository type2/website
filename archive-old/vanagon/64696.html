'Lo
Re Sudhir's query on making up a weekender, one thought to share is what
we do with our Westy. We have one of those blue tables that roll up and
have screw in al legs, available at many camping supply vendors. This
table fits nicely in front of the rear passenger seat and the right
front passenger seat when turned to face the rear.

While we also use the small westy tables on occasion, the blue table is
great for dinner and playing cards when the weather is ugly. When not in
use, it is stored to the right side behind the rear passenger seat,
taking up minimum room and weight.

The one downer is that comfortable access is denied from the front seat
so I sometimes stuff a pillow behind my back. Of course the table comes
in real handy for outdoor use too! Cost was $40 several years ago.
