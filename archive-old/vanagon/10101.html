&gt; could help but agree wholeheartedly with your assessment of original old VW
&gt; curtains. Dig that checkered yellow and brown material. Right On!!!!!!
&gt; That stuff is hard to find in good shape. The sun rotted most of those
&gt; curtains out years ago!

While we're on the subject, a couple of years ago I replaced the
curtains in my (April) '71 Campmobile, and I seem to have misplaced
the plastic doodads which fit in the rail above the sliding door
unto which the right side curtain does attach. Would anyone have
a source for replacement of same?
