and it's just remotely possible that it was simply the act of caring that
caused the gremlin to go away. ;)  we had a Univac computer like that once
... any other operator tried to run it, and it would get 'fault' lights and
just stop, about every 20 minutes. when i would reset it and run it myself,
it would run until i left. at which point it would promptly light up and
stop. :)  we never did figure out what the hell was going on.

we also had a much bigger machine that would crash every time a certain
engineer would walk past the main processor. and only when HE would walk
by. turned out to be a hairline crack in one of the processor boards ...
and Earl &quot;the Stump&quot; weighed more than the rest of us and just happened to
flex the floor under the cabinet just enough to separate that crack. us
lighter, much more svelte personages caused it no grief.

point being: machines sometimes act like they are not really just metal and
plastic. maybe your bus just wanted some affection and attention. :)
