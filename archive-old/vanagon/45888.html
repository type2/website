&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt;   Reciently I sent a post about having a weird electrical problem with my
&gt; dash pod on my '82 Vanagon.  Well, I hav another problem.  Receintly my
&gt; camper likes to stall out when I beep the horn.  I know it sounds funny but
&gt; it can be a pain in the butt.  Most of the time it will do this when I have
&gt; the headlights, wipers and blower on.  It has done it when nothing is on.

Hmmmm... I wonder if that extra bit of load as you beep the horn is an
indication that you need to check or replace your battery ground wire.
That's what I would check first.  Then the positive battery wire.  
After that, I'd check all the rest of the ground connections.  Any extra
voltage drops kinda screw up the voltage to the F.I. system.
