Subject: * THE VERDICT ON '86 VANAGON SYNCRO? *

Hi again,

Thanks very much to everyone on the list who has helped me.. =)

Well, I took the 1986 Vanagon GL Syncro into Heckmann and Thiemann Motors
today (per suggestion of an Oregon list member) and found out the
following:

* note: this Syncro has 143,000 miles on it..

- Compression test: 120, 140, 100, 135 (3rd cylinder = low compression)
  (mechanic performed a &quot;leakdown&quot; to get the results for #3 cylinder)

- Oil Leak at Front Transmission seal

- Left-front Outer CV Boot torn

- Water Pump is leaking

- Missing one Muffler hanger


* Asking price = $4000.00 *


I think I might just sit this one out.. I would be tempted to purchase this
Syncro and ride out the low compression reading on #3 until I can afford a
rebuild (a year from now..) I somehow think that this might be unwise, yet,
my current car, a 1984 Subaru 4wd GL Wagon had the same type of readings on
the engine 3 years ago when I bought it- no problems hence..

If I decide to make an offer on this, I am thinking $3500.00 (to cover cost
of other repairs).. Otherwise, there are more Syncros out there to be
found.. =)

Call me a dummy, call me what you will.. Anymore suggestions appreciated..



                                                        Chris..
