&gt; Below are some reminders of things to bring to Red Rock.  Let me say I've not 
&gt; been to this park, and maybe someone on our list who has can clarify this, but 
&gt; it looks like it would be wise to fill the gas tank before making the trek in 
&gt; there.  Does anyone know the last reasonably priced location to get gas?

I will reiterate.  Don't plan on buying gas in Mojave if you can help it,
because it is rather expensive.  I would expect regular unleaded to be about
$1.45/gallon there.  Gas up in Bakersfield, and you should have plenty.
&gt; 
&gt; Note:  there is no electricty at this site.  Bring whatever alternatively 
&gt; powered things you need.  Also, the toilets are the &quot;pits.&quot;  (Brace yourself).  
Yes, they are pits, but they are the cleanest, nicest ones you will ever use!

&gt; Lastly, and perhaps most important:  I'm told there is not water on site, but 
&gt; rather about a mile away, which one can of course drive to.  In the interest of 
&gt; fuel economy, you may not want to leave home with your vans full of heavy 
&gt; liquid, but I highly suggest bringing vessels of whatever type, and filling up 
&gt; just before finally arriving at the camp site.  

This isn't really necessary - there IS water at the campground, and I'm fairly
certain at this point that we will all be able to stay in the campground.
It isn't Perrier, however, so if you don't like drinking tap water, bringing
a gallon or two of Arrowhead might be a good idea!

&gt; LOTS of firewood, kindling, charcoal, skewers, starter, newspaper

IMPORTANT!

There is no firewood anywhere near Red Rock, and I don't think there is
anywhere to buy it, either.  If possible, could everyone pick up a bundle
at the supermarket or wherever?

&gt; beer, wine - bring lots
&gt; tequila and stuff for margaritas and sangria

Does anyone have the specs on a typical blender?  Is anyone bringing an
inverter to run it?  Should I bring ice?

&gt; Rain/cold Gear - just in case, but it could also be quite warm (bring layered 
&gt;         clothing)

&gt; Hiking, fishing, biking, surfing, or boating gear + games, etc.

Ummm... don't worry about the fishing, surfing and boating gear.  :)
