&gt;Hey, when you do the sliding door seal could you post (or email) any tips or
&gt;clues you learn?  I badly need to replace mine too, but haven't worked up the
&gt;nerve yet...
&gt;

OK,, will do.

Want a $2.00 tip: Go to any hardware store or such where they sell that strip
of rubber that goes under a garage door. It is about 3 inches wide and about
10-15 feet long. I cut a strip of this just as long as my sliding door and 
used some double-sided tape to connect it to the top of the DOOR. Not Frame.
I did this mostly to keep it from rattling, but it keeps about 90% of the heavy
rain out. Only when flying down the road ina rainstorm does any get in now. Used
to be able to raise frogs in there! But I am planning to fix it right soon.
