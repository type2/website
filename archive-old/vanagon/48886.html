 Dennis, thanks for the insight re: the trailer brake issue, While I totally
agree with the legal and practical aspect of towing a vanagon on all 4's, I
have sucessfully towed my van behind a 35' Monaco motorhome w/4 wheel discs
w/o ever knowing it was behind as the additional 4k lbs was insignificant in
relation to the overall mass of the RV 22k lbs.Then again, Ive towed my 8k lb
boat w/4 wheel brakes on the trailer and definately appreciate the added
stopping power.
  &gt;&gt;
That is why I asked what vehicle is being used to do the towing.  Just
consider though, if you were descending a mountain pass, how would the brakes
then react?  Believe it or not, I've even used a Vanagon to tow a Vanagon
 Once without the brake equipped dolly.  Stopping was scarier than getting it
to roll.  Anyway, all this question going on tells me that some people have
little clue as to what they are doing.  That is why I threw in my 2 cents.

Dennis
