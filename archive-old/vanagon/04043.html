&gt; David,
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry to hear about the woes that thine Bus (pronounce it 
&gt; with a long u) is having.  I can understand how that 
&gt; would quell the urge to...  Well lots of urges.
&gt; Apologies about the tone of my original post but I had
&gt; visions of all these juicy discussions passing me by 
&gt; just like the cars do on the road. --Ralf

Blunder #2 for me (I should give up and go home at this point)... I
thought you were in B.C but now I see you are in Ottawa.  Even so, the
&quot;trip&quot; is supposed to go by that area (in Canada) so I hope you will
consider at least participating in that leg of the journey.  No
offense taken at any previous postings, btw.  I see where you're coming
from...

Cheers,
	-David
