I never used anyone's tire for those purposes, but I do plan on more of 
my binges.

&gt; Anyway, there are three possible in Tulare, and two
&gt; in Buttonwillow.  I'll call Cal Trans in the morning,
&gt; to see what all facilities they have at these places.

I'd have to say Tulare.  It's about 120 miles from Red Rock, so about 2 
hours away.  Which is really plenty of time since we'll most likely not 
stay where ever we stop very late.

For the people that were thinking of Lost hills, the reason Martha and I 
are thinking of other places are... I-5 is a fast road, VW buses aren't.  
Also I-5 had a bridge out, and I believe it's a one lane bridge for the 
next few months.  And I've never taken 99 before.  And it seems a more 
direct route.  My personal reason, I don't want to pay $20 to park my bus 
for a few hours while I sleep.

I'd have done that in a top ten style list, but I only had 5.
