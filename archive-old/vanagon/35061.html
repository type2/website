&gt;When I bought my Camper the heating system was totally dismantled.

&gt;where the exchangers bolt to the heads.  My exchangers were scetchy

&gt;rebuilding my engine). To make sure there were no holes I removed the 
&gt;tinware on the outside of the exchangers.  There were no holes! Since 
&gt;I have no heating system, do I need to put the tinware back on? Will 
&gt;the lack of tinware cause the engine compartment to be hotter than if 
&gt;it had tinware? Thanks in advance.

I'm not sure exactly which pieces you are talking about.  You mean you
took the exchangers themselves apart?  If so, then technically, no, you
wouldn't need to put the outside skin back on them for engine cooling
sake.  But on the 1600 engine, you'd want to block off the holes on the
fan that connect to the heat exchanger with tubes, since this would just
be blowing air into the atmosphere and would reduce the amount of pressure
for cooling the engine.  Not sure what the set up is on a Type IV.  If
it's some other tin piece you're talking about, part of the cooling system
itself, then you probably need to reinstall it.  Having all your factory
tin installed is regarded as a Good Thing (tm) when it comes to
cooling.  :-)
