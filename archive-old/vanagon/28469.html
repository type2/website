&gt;&gt; Any advice on mounting the spare on the nose? Should I paint

&gt;I certainly would. That'd be a good place to start rusting. You wouldn't 
&gt;notice it for awhile, hopefully. You shouldn't have to use your spare. I 
&gt;might even squirt some silicone rubber stuff on the screws you use to 
&gt;attach the mounting bracket. 
Dammit, Jim, what's this fixation with silicone you have??  It's comments
like this that lead to the eventual downfall of civilization...  oops...
Never Mind.  :-)
