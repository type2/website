Subject: Electrical Idea(s)


Wow .... I'm slowly going from an innocent, well-meaninged contribution to
well over my head. As I cited, I'm not electrically inclined so I had
professional help on this and placed a LOT of trust in an RV dealer and a
manufacturer.

The inverter was mounted between the Eurovan front seats and two 4 gauge
cables (two positive and two ground) were used between the Aux battery and
the inverter; distance would be less than three feet.

The microwave, during the test, was placed in the area of the sliding door;
distance would have been about three to four feet.

Again, I mentioned that we tried another brand that was rated at even
smaller power and the micro wave worked as expected.

  Quality is no guarantee of success, to do nothing is to guarantee failure!
