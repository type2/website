                    Hair-Ball Run -- It's On!

The engine I've slapped together over the past week decided to run
today.  I hope that hard knocking don't mean nothing serious.

I should have enough time on it to do the re-torquing by Monday,
tear it down to fit into the trunk of the car I'm driving to
Seattle.  Be a tight squeeze but do-able.  The bus is now at Earl
Oster's house (Eric's bro) a few miles north of Olympia,
Washington.  I'll drop the engine off, deliver the car, take care
of my business, plug the engine into the bus and toodle on home.

I've promoted a lap-top computer for the trip so I can keep in
touch.  I've never tried typing and driving at the same time. 
Tried everything else, though.  And have the scars to prove it.

Getting home will take... as long as it takes, then I'll have to
put aside my childish things for a while and earn some money so I
can drive to the Arctic Ocean next summer.  I may even decide to do
it in the Oster/Seattle bus, mebbe even with the same engine.  If
I took my '65 bus with its big engine, we'd just run off and leave
all those modern buses.  Pure kindness on my part, poking along in
an antique bus with a hay-wired engine just so's those newer things
won't look so bad.  

The Coyote keeps asking me for the name of the bus.  The-bus-Eric-
Oster-found-for-me seems a little long.  Any ideas?

                      Name the Bus Contest

I don't name things.  I would never think of calling a bus 'Mango'. 
(Sounds kinda like the Great White Hunter's gun-bearer.)

Why don't you guys name the bus?  Let's have a bus-naming contest! 
Get Joel and Martha and maybe Rusty and Andrea to be the Name
Selection Committee.  (Anyone else?  Lotsa lurkers out there, bound
to be a judge or two amongst them.)

So we got what -- four hundred listees?  I figure maybe half of
them is awake at any one time, mebbe a quarter of that even faintly
interested in naming a bus.  Probably more if we offered a prize.

Have to extend that to the Thing people, too.  Things is sorta buses in
disguise.

                       Name The Bus Prize

Howzabout an engine?  No, not a free one!  But I could screw the
parts together.  That's worth five, ten bucks right there.  You
name the bus and I'll assemble an engine for you; you buy the parts
and pay for the shipping.  Or drive by the shop and I'll stick it
in, same deal.  I'll have to limit that to air-cooled up-rights. 
I don't feel I'm qualified for a Type IV's. 

Of course, if this thing I just slapped together blows up half-way
to Redding, you may wish to reconsider :-)
