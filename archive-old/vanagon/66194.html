Subject:      Re: What is &quot;Level&quot;?

&gt; Instructions for the Dometic refrigerator specify not to operate it
&gt; unless it is &quot;level&quot; or damage will occur.  Does anyone know the
&gt; specifications for the maximum limit of tilt tolerated?  What damage will
&gt; occur if the refrigerator is operated outside these specifications?  Has
&gt; anyone actually damaged their refrigerator by running it while their
&gt; Vanagon is not &quot;level&quot;?
&gt;
&gt; Most of the information we have on this is very subjective.  If anyone
&gt; has any hard data specifications, I'm sure many of us would like to hear
&gt; them.
&gt;

The &quot;Camper/Multivan&quot; supplement that came with the Owner's Manual for my
'91 Westy states &quot;The refrigerator works best when the vehicle is standing
on level ground up to an 15% angle&quot; (p. 16).  Personally, I've never seen
anything in either the Dometic owner's manual or the Dometic Service
manual that supports the contention that running the unit out of level
will actually damage it.
