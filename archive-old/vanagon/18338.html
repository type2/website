Subject: Re: '71 Timing

The guy at my machine shop (who was a Gene Berg disciple) swore that 28 degrees 
at full advance was the magic number. I have always set my type I motor to this 
and have had good luck.

I have never had the cajones to try anything higher. Supposedly it would run 
hotter. This heat would then heat the kitties litter box, making for a most 
unpleasant journey...

FWIW,
Erik

&gt; OK, we're getting ready for the trip to South Carolina with the two 6 
&gt; week old kitties. Everything is pretty much set. I have a question. I was 
&gt; out working on Blushie (my '71 pop top) and installed new points, 
&gt; condenser, &amp; plugs. I think I remember somewhere that the maximum amount 
&gt; of advance at hiway speeds is 28 degrees BTDC. Is this correct? I've also 
&gt; heard a figure of around 34 degrees. I'm running a stock 1600 dual port 
&gt; with a stock carb and an 009 distributor. I set it up to go no farther 
&gt; than 28 degrees at speed and the idle kicks in around 6 degrees.
&gt; Any suggestions would be helpful. I'll be setting my Vanagon list to 
&gt; nomail sometime Friday evening, or Saturday morning, so if you would 
&gt; please e-mail me directly in case my carrier doesn't pick it up till it's 
&gt; too late. Thanks a bunch, in advance.
