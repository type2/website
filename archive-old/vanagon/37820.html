Subject: Need Zemco/Direct Buyer Service contact information ...


Way back when, Joel Walker wrote about all the way cool things he did to his
Vanagon.  That message wound up in the Vanagon Web Server
(http://www.automatrix_dot_com/~skip/volkswagen/) with a phone number and
address for the Direct Buyer Service where Joel purchased his Zemco ZT-4
driving computer.  The phone number listed is now incorrect.  I suspect DBS
went out of business.

In any event, I have had some phone calls recently asking about the Zemco
unit.  Zemco themselves are apparently out of business.  I'm searching for a
contact phone number for anybody with information about Zemco products
(former distributors, Zemco fanatics, etc).  In particular, one fellow
without net access is looking for an owner's manual.  If you can help,
please drop me a note.

Thanks,
