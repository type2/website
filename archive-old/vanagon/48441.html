So Berry Kercheval says:
&gt; fitting into the graphite-laden grommet. If you can arrange to have done
&gt; hand-strengthening exercises for the last 6 weeks here, it would help.
&gt; 
&gt; And start squeezing a rubber ball now, for that extra hand strength.

For most engine access jobs, I think you need to run your hand through
a hand mixer while it's on to prepare for the job.....
