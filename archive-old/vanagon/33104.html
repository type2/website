Subject: Blizzard of '96

I drove my 69 westy out into the snow and amazing winds of Kansas today. I
teach band at one of the Wichita High Schools and was only a 1/4 mile from
school when I found out about the school closings. We're having wind chills
of -40 and colder. The bus ran great but I have a slight problem with the
heat system. I don't have any kind of aux. heater so I'm stuck with the
heat exchanger stuff. It sort of works but I'm getting this obnoxious odor
through the tubes. It smells like a combination of dirty, greasy engine and
gasoline, mixed with a faint whisp of exhaust. Is this normal? (BTW the bus
is so full of holes I'm not to worried about asphyxiation, (Sometimes I
even get snow drifts INSIDE the bus)
I'm just trying to get my windshield defrosted). Even with the heat
problems, It will be cool to tell my grand kids (sometime in the future)
about How I ventured out in the blizzard of '96, nothin but me and my VW,
hundred mile an hour winds, snow drifts ten feet high, why I remember when
you......................
