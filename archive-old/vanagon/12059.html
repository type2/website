Here is my problem: 

The A/C on my 90 Syncro Westy seems to stop working every 3 years. 

I suspect a slow leak and my experience suggests that the shop is too lazy
to find a slow leak. 

So I am thinking that when I take the van in in a couple of weeks (to an
official VW dealer, cause it is still under warranty) I am doing to demand,
even if I have to pay the diagnostic fee myself, that they take the system
down to 29 inches (pounds?) of vacume and then see if they can detect any
leak at all. 

Then, whey they admit that there is a slow leak, that I demand that they use
their sniffer for as long as it takes to find the leak. 

Comments? 

Strategy?
