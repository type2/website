Subject: Re: Cooling Problems

Your temperature swings are suggestive of a sticky thermostat. This is
one of those rare cases where a VW part is recommended; buy a VW
thermostat. 

As far as getting rid if the air bubble is concerned, drive the van on
legs long enough to get the thermostat wide open. After such a drive,
let it cool down (over night) and top up the overflow afterwards. 

When the engine is hot, the air in the system will expand and purge into
the overflow. When it cools, antifreeze from the overflow will be drawn
in. Over two or three such trips, your coolant overflow level should no
longer go down.
