Subject: Re: Eurovan Questions

&gt;  Eurovan Owners,
&gt; 1. Gas guage: When it read 1/2 how many gallons are left? Is the 1/2
&gt; based on the total volume of the gas tank (21 gallons, right?) or does
&gt; it not include the red-zone reserve of 2? gallons??

On my EV the &quot;first&quot; half seems bigger than the &quot;second&quot; half.  That is I 
get more mileage from F to 1/2 than from 1/2 to E.  

&gt; 2. Engine Oil dipstick: when the oil is down to the end of the crossed
&gt; section is it one quart low or more than one quart??

Can;t say off the top of my head.
