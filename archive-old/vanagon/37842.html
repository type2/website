Subject:  Re: Mods to install door speakers in v-gon?

speakers so that the sound is great from both the driving and the

well, i think my setup is pretty ok for a relatively sane amount of $$.  i
have 6&quot; blaupunkt woofers at the bottom of the doors (slight cutting of
metal necessary on driver's side to avoid map pocket), surface-mount
tweeters in the corners of the dash ($140 new for the 4 piece set,
cheaper is certainly available), and 3-way 6x9s (bought used) mounted
in the rear hatch panel (my van has been partially westy-ized and has
the closet, so the speakers are only a little over a foot apart - but good
enough for a fair stereo image if you're lying in bed).  the extra weight in
the door will stress your lift struts, though, and this arrangement is
definitely not acceptable for those averse to cutting/drilling a little here
and there.  all this is powered by the receiver/amp (20x4, $200 new,
with remote!).  a free-air sub and amp  might be nice someday mounted
under the bench seat.  chant: consume, consume, consume....
