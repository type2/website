Subject: Re: 'falia Sink Pump Questions
From: jcunning_at_snow.win_dot_net (John H. Cunningham)

The submersible pump in my '90 Vanagon stopped working after being
run dry. I replaced it with an $18 bilge pump, instead of buying a
$98 VW replacement. It works just fine.
 
&gt;The pump for my sink has never worked since I purchased my
&gt;'falia.  So this past weekend I was on a mission from God to
&gt;remedy this situation.
&gt;
&gt;First,after removing all the crap stored in the cabinet and taking
&gt;out the pump shelf cover I noticed that the pump connector for the
&gt;hose going to the sink was broken off.  So, #1 - I need to get a
&gt;new pump.  Any help here on prices and resellars?  I noticed that
&gt;the pump manufacturer is in North Hollywood (I'm in L.A.) does
&gt;anyone know if this place is still in business?  Do they sell to
&gt;the public?
&gt;
&gt;Second, I didn't hear the pump work.  Should it work w/o  any
&gt;water in the tank?  I was testing for other problems such as the
&gt;16 amp fuse under the drivers seat which the manual mentions.  The
&gt;pump fuse is easy to check (it was fine) but I didn't want to remove
&gt;the drivers seat at this time since I need a pump first anyway.  But
&gt;this fuse, I assume, must be for other items e.g. the light above the
&gt;sink?  So if the this light works the fuse must be o.k.?
&gt;
&gt;Last, there is a hole in the side of the cabinet, behind the drivers
&gt;seat where the wires from the battery come through.  There is also a
&gt;white coated 24awg wire coming through but doesn't connect to anything.
&gt;Any ideas what this is for.  Thanks.
&gt;
&gt;-Scott.
