Subject:       Re: Eurovan Westfailia Seen!  Was: westfalia ? 

&gt; If anyone has a few minutes could they give a brief description of the 
&gt; vans avaliable in US. Vanagon? Westfalia? Eurovan? CrewCab?

I was so happy today!

On my way to school/work today, I was behind a cool teal camper Eurovan. 
Me thought I  saw a Westfailia logo on the 'oh so short' pop top. 
When I pulled up behind it at a light  IT WAS!   I thought I heard someone 
here on the list say that they weren't available in the U.S.?

Anyhow, it was really cool!
