So will someone hurry up and be the first one to try Kyle's new exhaust for
the 2.1?  My mechanic said I will need a new exhaust system by spring and
that it will cost around $1500!  A quick look at Kyle's prices shows quite
a savings.

Maybe everyone can put in $10 and buy a test set for... uummm... Malcom. 
He should give us a complete report!  ;)

&gt; 
&gt;   John &amp; List members,
&gt; 
&gt;   Well, these Pipes are the DANSK pipes.
&gt; 
&gt;   I do Understand the problems that there have been in the past.
&gt; 
&gt;   I work in a VW shop and We install these pipes.  There was a batch of 
&gt; 1.9 Pipes that were Awful, they fit like S--- and the couple that we Did 
&gt; install we had to heat up and tweak them a bit:(
&gt; 
&gt;   We didn't stop installing these pipes, but we did cringe everytime we 
&gt; had to install them after those FEW Poorly fitting ones we did install! 
&gt;  We've had all good ones since that One batch of Funky ones about 1 year 
&gt; ago.
&gt; 
&gt;   I'm not sure if there was a New guy in the plant or ??
&gt; 
&gt;   I know that the cost of these pipes are alot less than the VW Pipes.
&gt; 
&gt;   I encurage any and All comments on this topic.
&gt;   
&gt;     I also know that the people with the 2.1 engines that have welded  
&gt; and re-welded their pipes will be happy to see that there Is an 
&gt; alternative to the Dealer Cost of the pipes!
