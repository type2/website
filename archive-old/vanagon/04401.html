Subject: Re: Car Talk

You can't get Car Talk here in Nova Scotia, but I used to listen when I
lived in Boston and loved the show.I sure dom miss it. I do have on tape
this special they did called live from Greaseland with special guest Arlo
Guthrie. Guess what Arlo was driving(in the script of the show).
They may have degrees from MIT, but they slam VW's so they can't be that smart.
