Subject: Re: 87 Syncro CV Joint/ Spares List

&gt;shaft.  The cage for the outer driver side CV joint is cracked.  I called at
&gt;least 30 parts places this morning and found only 2 that had the joint.  


Since VW never made a lot of Syncros to begin with, but has made a lot of
front wheel drive models, I wonder if the joint is truly 'Syncro only'? Does
anyone know if there exists a non-vanagon substitute for the Syncro outer CV
joint. Not even strictly VW, how about Audi? Saab? Who actually makes these
units, Lobro?  anyone with a Lobro catalogue who can do some cross
referencing for us Syncro folks? Being able to pull front heater fans from
Rabbits has certainly made my life cheaper and easier, lets hear it for the
CVs now.  

In fact, how about generating a cross referenced parts list for the
vanagons, something to go into Coyotes FAQ site.  Nice to know that a fuel
pump from a ???? will work in a vanagon etc.  Sort of list that I'd like
with me heading of into the great unknown.  Perhaps the vendors who grace
this list could put this together from their catalogues/sources?

Thanks, Tim
