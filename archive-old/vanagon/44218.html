Subject: 'blue dot' tail-light lenses

newbie question of the day... anyone know of a supplier of 'blue dot'
tail-light lenses? I've seen them on some of the vintage american classics,
but can't recall ever seeing any on an import. My OE lenses are chipped and
cracked, and I also need to replace the rear sidemarker lenses as well.

thanks in advance,
