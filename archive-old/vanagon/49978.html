Subject: ?Audi 5 cyl to 68 &amp; newer TII Trannies

Hi All,

Just a quick question on the net knowledge of mating an Audi 5 cyl
(Turbo?) motor to a 68 &amp; newer TII tranny.  I know about the South African
use of Audi motors in Vanagons, but how does the engine mounting compare
with, say, a 1600 rabbit motor?  I saw a clean installation of a rabbit
motor in a 76 Bus at BBTA and Weddle Engineering sells Vanagon Diesel
bellhousings used for $15 (I hope it's not a typo). Engine heighth is not
a great concern, the vehicle's already ben butchered up quite a bit. 8-( 

I have a pet project where I am hoping to H2o a previously air-headed 
VW just for the heck of it.  I may go the 16v VW route, but the
possiblity of using an Audi 5 cyl intriguing, esp. a turbo motor.  8-)
