Elliot w/ the '93 EV MV Weekender inquired:

&gt;Has anyone solved this? Or eliminated potential sources?

I don't know if Jack Lowry has read your post yet, but here's
his response from 6/4/96 (or 4/6/96, for you Euro types...):


&gt;Don't try this if you are uncomfortable with your soldering abilities.
&gt;Steps to repair: (I'll keep them short because most the people that hang 
&gt;out here seem to know which end of a screw driver to hold.)
&gt;
&gt;1. remove steering wheel.
&gt;2. Remove cover around the steering column.
&gt;3. remove turn signal and wiper switch from the column (there are 2 or 3 
&gt;screws to do this, do not remove the
&gt;torx head screw. You may also have to remove some wires from the switches.
&gt;4. remove black plastic inside of gauge cave. (two screws at top)
&gt;5. remove plastic face over gauges (two screws one on each side of cover)
&gt;6. Remove tach ( It Just plugs in)
&gt;
&gt;The problem is related to three solder connections in a row at about the 
&gt;2:00 position in the hole where the tach was.
&gt;These connections need to be reheated with possibly a little solder added. 
&gt;There are some voltage measurements
&gt;that have slipped my memory that can also help to tell if you have a bad 
&gt;part or just broken solder connections.
&gt;

'Hope this helps.
