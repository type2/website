Subject: Sphonfirkle!

It's been a long time since I've posted.  Don't want anyone to think I've
disappeared.  So - hello there.

The blue thing accomplished its 105,000th mile this very evening.  I'm proud
of it and it's four years old this very month!  I still haven't had  the new
CV boot put in yet but it's going in this week or else!

Lastly, I'm starting my new job tomorrow morning!  Wish me luck y'all!  (And
if it wasn't for my Transporter I wouldn't have got it at all.  How about
that?)  :)

Oh, is this the most &quot;normal&quot; post I've yet produced?  Answers to
gremlin_at_iol.ie with your credit card number and expiry date before next
Tuesday...
