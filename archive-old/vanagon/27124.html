Jack, Im sorry you didnt quite understand. The guys I am referring to are the
appropriate inanimate suppression caps.Yes, they are located between the plug
and plug wire(the metal piece you usually pull on to remove  the wire)They
can be very  tempermental and fail without warning. They are made by either
Bosch or Beru, two German electronic companies. MBZ signifies  Mercedes Benz
which uses a similar wire resistance setup and  you can purchase just the
resistor ends from them for a surprisingly low price, if your current wires
 are ok.You can tell this by ohming(using an ohm meter)the wires without the
resistance caps on to ascertain if you have some resistance or wether you
have an open circuit(infinity ohms).
