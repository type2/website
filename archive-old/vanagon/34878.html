Uh-oh.

Some friends once had a Diesel Rabbit, 1979 I think (?). It broke
its timing belt... and the engine promptly trashed itself. Some engines,
when the timing belt breaks, let one or more valves hang down far
enough to hit the rising piston, and much unhappiness results.
Other engines don't.

Anyone know if the '82 Diesel Vanagon has the same engine as the
Diesel Rabbit?

Yes, my friend had to replace the Rabbit engine completely-- wasn't even
rebuildable.
