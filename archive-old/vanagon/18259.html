&gt;&gt;David,
&gt;&gt;   I'm real new to the list so forgive me if this is a FAQ &amp; I should have
&gt;&gt;known better...  My '81 Westy leaks oil like a sieve, I paid to have
&gt;&gt;push rod tube seals redone and it still leaks.  From the tone of your 
&gt;&gt;note, this is not uncommon?  Thanks for any insights -

Rick, it seems to be a popular problem too. But I am not aware that there is
a FTC/VWoA settlement that owners of VW vanagon can ask VWoA to pay the bill 
for fixing it.

My suggestion is make sure if the leak is indeed from the seals of the push
rod tubes. If yes, replace the seals with teflon (sp) seals which resist
much better the heat from the heads and will not leak again. If the leak is from
crank pulley seal then the problem is tough. The engine case has to be opened
to replace the seal. If the leak is not from the push rod tube seals and you do
not lose more than 25% (or as much as 1 quart) of oil every 3000 miles I think
you can wait until the engine is off the van next time to fix.

See what everyone else from the group has to suggest. Good luck. Welcome to join 
the list.
