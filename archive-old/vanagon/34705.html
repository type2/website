Subject: Re: EV

&gt; I'm shortly going to be in the market for a new Mom's vehicle to replace the
&gt; country squire and all of the enthusiasm about the EV is beginning to have an
&gt; effect. 

They are mighty nice.
 
&gt; I recently got a promo tape from from VOA(in respose to a request for the
&gt; Jerry Garcia poster which they didn't include) and noted that the EV was not
&gt; mentioned in either the tape or the promo material. Is the EV, or something
&gt; like it, still offered? I've only seen a couple and never been in one. Is it
&gt; honestly a match or superior to the Chrysler products. Same price range?

Chrysler?  &lt;chortle&gt; &lt;snicker&gt;

Do you want a van or a station wagon?  VW or Chrysler?  In particular the 
MV is fantastic - nothing on the market to match (IMO).

My brother has a Dodge.  After the EV it is short and cramped.  Compared 
to a station wagon it is probably roomy.  Gas mileage is similar between 
the two I know about.

Supposedly the EV will be re-introduced to the US market later this 
spring with a V6 engine.  Probably lower gas mileage but higher power.  
Overkill but probably gonna be nice.  Hopefully the MV will come back in 
with the GL and I guess a CL also.
