&gt; David, 
&gt; 
&gt; All the ones I have ever seen have a factory installed set of leads.  The
&gt; length of these leads is included in the calibration done at the factory. 
&gt; The ideal situation is not to mess with the length, as you will screw up
&gt; the calibration.  If you must, then you need a friend who works at a lab
&gt; with the tools to do the calibration. That is, if there is a calibration
&gt; screw on the temperature guage (some of the cheap ones I have seen are
&gt; sealed).  As a strictly hypothetical alternative, with no guarantee, (note
&gt; I am weaseling here) you might try this: 
&gt; 
&gt; 1 install the sender (but leave the leads alone)
&gt; 2 run the leads out of the engine compartment to a convenient place (like 
&gt;   your shop bench)
&gt; 3 attach the meter to the factory length leads while it is on the bench
&gt; 4 idle the car for &gt;20 min (fully warmed up)
&gt; 5 note the temperature on the guage
&gt; 6 stop the car, run the leads to the dash, clip'em, splice'em, whatever.
&gt; 7 attach the meter
&gt; 8 run the car again til fully warm
&gt; 9 adjust the needle to the previously noted temperature
&gt; 10 let me know whether you shortened/lengthened the leads, and what 
&gt;    variation it caused.  (I love a good experiment)
&gt; 
&gt; Ideally you should recalibrate at 2 or 3 different temperature points, but
&gt; normal operating temperature is the most important.  Check your plan of
&gt; action real careful before you start cutting tho, coz' you shouldn't have
&gt; to.  I often run into situations where I spend hours doing that I could
&gt; have saved with a couple of minutes of thinking.

Steve: Sami's your man, he hasn't put his gauge in yet. Mine's installed
and there are bascally two leads about a 18 inches in length.From that
run two 18 gauge wires to the front gauge. As I understand it you are
saying these will effect the signal? Hmmm. Readings seem to show about
normal temps - 350C but what in your opinion would the readings be if they
 were the incorrect length - too high or too low? DC
