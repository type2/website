&gt;First I want to thank everyone who sent me comments, suggestions, 
&gt;well-wishes, etc.  Some of your ideas were excellent, and I'm going to make 
&gt;use of them.  Please keep 'em coming!
&gt;
&gt;If you e-mailed me for a price quote and didn't get a response yet, please 
&gt;be patient.  I was absolutely overwhelmed with queries!!  I was answering 


&gt;For the last time STOP running a damn business on this list. period.  I do
&gt;not need to hear your daily trials and tribulations about setting up the
&gt;business.  When you have a special offer, like Kyle, post a short note to
&gt;remind us of it and your website.  But cut out this kind of 'feel good'
&gt;message and blatant commercial plugging.  It is pure SPAM, and is not found
&gt;on the other two vehicle lists I subscribe(d) to, notably the Audi and
&gt;Porsche lists.  Tim Smith

TIM--&gt;  CHILL!!!!  MAYBE YOU DO NOT LIKE TO READ ABOUT THIS BUSINESS, BUT IT
SURE SEEMS LIKE THE MAJORITY OF US ARE EAGER TO.  I SUGGEST THAT YOU SIMPLY
DELETE MESSAGES REGARDING THE SUBJECT BEFORE READING THEM.  THAT WAY THEY
WON'T UPSET YOU, AND THE REST OF US CAN GET ON WITH THE BUSINESS OF ENJOYING
THE LIST (IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT US ENJOYING IT, ISN'T IT?).  HAVE A
PROSPEROUS DAY!!!     :-)
