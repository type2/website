Subject: Re: Wanted 89 Vanagon 4spd from low mileage

when the tranny in my '83 needed a rebuild I called around alot and 
found nothing....that includes anyone in the NJ area who I would 
trust to rebuild it.  So,  I called nationwide....the best price,  
the most experience....Fast German Auto in LA {calif.}.  I had the 
tranny removed,  crated,   and aired to California,  they rebuilt it 
{I needed just about everything} shipped it back had it reinstalled,  
1yr 10K warrantee for around $1000.00.  Its been running great for 
40K but do change the oil after the first 10K to get rid of the 
&quot;break in schrapnel&quot;,  and I do change the oil yearly for my own 
sanity.
