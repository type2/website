&gt; I think the next SoCal meet is June 9th.  I'm not sure where it's at - OC
&gt; Fairgrounds maybe.  I think there's one also in September, but I had not
&gt; heard of one in August.  Does anyone have the specicfics on upcomming SoCal
&gt; shows?
&gt; 

jim, there is a Pomona Antique Swap  comming up in the next few weeks.
that is suposed to be befor the june 9th show.  the weekend of the 9th is
the Classic weekend.  Berg Rally friday night, SOTO saturday morning, Toy
show saturday night and the Classic on sunday.  Definatly the best weekend
in So Cal for shows.  hope to see you all out there.  The Berg Rally
starts at Gene Burg Ent. in Orange.  The SOTO meet is at the Boy's and
Girl's club of Garden Grove.  Toy show at Irvine hilton and the Classic at
Irvine Medows.  The classic is in the big parking lot and will fill it up.
Free entry for you car in that show.
