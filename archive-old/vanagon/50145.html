      Sorry I didn't mean to start a problem, But I just  don't have the 
      time to mess with engineering non-sense in a practical real world.
      I work with the most sensetive motion equipment in the world. 
      After we engineer a project, we throw away the plains and use
      common sense to make things work.      

       I did my head gaskets 70,000 miles ago. Haven't changed the 
       coolant and  use regular Prestone anti-freeze! 
       FIGURE THIS OUT AND YOU WILL HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS YOU WANT.
