Uh, if the only problem is that it is running real rich, but it is still
within the factory adjustment range, then I wouldn't worry about it. There
must be some other set of symptoms you arn't telling us about or you
wouldn't worry about it.

I do remember that running a motor too lean can cause its premature demise.
So I'd rather have it rich than lean. 

So, actually, as you can see, I don't have much input. I (we) will be
learning from *you*.


&gt;Derek,
&gt;
&gt;I live just north east of hartford.  The problem with my van is that is is
&gt;running real rich.  I've replaced all the sensors with the exception of the
&gt;air temp sensor which is located in the air flow box.  The local vw mechanic
&gt;seems to think the problem is with the box itself.  I've measured the voltage
&gt;at the O2 sensor and have found it to be around 0.8 to 0.9 volts, which is at
&gt;the max upper limit  of richness!!. Adjusting the C0 screw to lean out the
&gt;mixture does nothing.  Also when checking the resistances of the meter
&gt;according to Bently everything seems fine, however, when i move the air flow
&gt;flap the change in resistance is not smooth.  it jumps all over the place.
&gt; possible other problems may include, bad fuel pressure regulator, injectors,
&gt;or computer.  the dealer said the computer is fine.  Anyway, because the car
&gt;runs so rich, the O2 sensor tries to compensate and really leans out the
&gt;mixture causing a rough idle.  any input???
&gt;
&gt;thanks
