Subject: 93 Eurovan MV for sale in VA
Date: Sun, 21 Apr 1996 20:14:13 -0400 (EDT)

93 Eurovan MV, 33k miles, automatic, AC, very clean, no weekender
package: $18495. And that's VERY firm since it's offered at Carmax in
Richmond, VA - (804)346-CARS. Saw it, drove it ... it's very nice but
too much money for me.
