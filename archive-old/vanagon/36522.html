Hi Volks,
   I've done some updating to the Limbo web site.   Check it out!
http://www.bcn_dot_net/~limbo/    I haven't finished the links page but I'm
going to as soon as possible.  Thanks by the way to everyone who sent me
their web site addresses.  Look for another 'live chat' nite coming soon.
The one we had on the 16th went great.  Take care.
