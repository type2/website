Subject:      Big Mutha Wire and Bus Cake

david asked what 'gauge' the wire was, that i ran from the battery to the
starter mounting bolts. i used one that was as big as my little fingers
... i have no idea what 'gauge' it was. 2? 3?  i got it because i also found
the connectors for it ... they had to be propane-torch soldered on. :(

now, in retrospect, i think a good 8 gauge would work just as well ... if it
is good enough for an ammeter, it ought to work fine for this. and it would
be a helluva lot easier to work with. but i would still solder the connectors
onto the wire. maybe a 6 gauge if you really want to get fancy.

bus cake: a friend once made me a birthday cake, in the shape and color of
my old 80 bus. the wheels were oreos, the headlights were marshmellows, and
the tailights were jelly beans. it looked really neat. but that blue icing
was a bitch ... really messed up your teeth! :)
