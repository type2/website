&gt; So me thinks either damaged electronics (hope not), an injector or two 
&gt;     stuck open (from pencil debris {see earlier posts}) or 
&gt;     electrical/plumbing connections done incorrectly.  I'd guess that the 
&gt;     injectors would get clogged not stuck open if there were debris in the 
&gt;     fuel line.

John,

Your problem is more than likely an electrical sensor that is not installed
correctly or has made a poor contact.  I just went through this with my 85
(albeit watercooled).  The problem was the temperture sensor.  One of the
contacts inside the connector had slipped back into the connector housing.
 When the computer couldn't sense the engine temp, it sent way too much fuel
to the injectors.

Good luck!  Let us know how it turns out.
