&gt;        I have a AT FI 84 and have a similar problem.  It only happens
&gt;        occasionally and seems to be related to cold temperatures--
&gt;        Atlanta hasn't been _that_ cold though...!

rather than bomb the list with all that nasty water-cooled tech bulletin
stuff again, :)  check the stuff i sent out in a previous reply. or let me
know and i'll dump the whole thing on you. it's just food for thought, but
at least you'd have something other than the air box for the mech to check.
