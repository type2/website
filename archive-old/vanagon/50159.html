Subject: Re: Brake fluid servicing

Hello Normand.  I've had the brake fluid changed every 2 years, as 
per VW's recommendation.  When I did my brakes on our 9 year old Golf 
this summer (it had 200,000 km on the original brakes!!), I extracted 
the piston from the caliper.  There was NO corrosion in the caliper.  
This is owed to clean, uncontaminated fluids.

Hope this helps,
Harry.
