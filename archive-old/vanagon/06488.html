&gt;Any experiences in using the 1776 motor in 71-earlier busses?  This seems
&gt;to be the most common upgrade, power-wise.  SO, my questions:

&gt;1)  What mods. need to be made (better carb., external oil cooler, new
&gt;case, etc.)?

&gt;2)  Is the 1776 the best for a bus?  I understand that it uses the stock
&gt;69mm crank and 90.5 jugs; what about larger crank options and modified
&gt;heads, i.e., the &quot;041&quot; or &quot;044.&quot;

&gt;3)  Driving Specs.:  Combination of city/highway driving and fairly
&gt;rugged mountain-road driving.  I'd prefer to keep the tranny stock.

&gt;THANKS!!

I personally don't have any experience with this engine but most of the
articles I have read over the years indicate this engine will increase the
top end performance significantly at the expense of the bottom end.  I think
you would need to go with the stroker crank to get the torque to handle 
those
mountain roads.
