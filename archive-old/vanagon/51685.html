You may need your O2 (or is it the C02) set.  The only place around me that 
has the machine to do this is the dealer (yech..)

Subject:  '83.5 wasserboxer idling strange

Good morning!

Well, along with the cold weather comes strange behavior from the bus! The
problem isn't serious at all yet, just curious and would like to prevent
any problems.

As the subject says, my bus is idling strange, whether warm or cold. It's
almost like you lightly touch the gas pedal every second or so. The
rev/idle is very consistent and rhythmic. It doesn't seem to effect the
drivability at all and doesn't stall when idling for extended periods, say
10 minutes.

Any advice/comments?

Thanks!

tony
