&gt; Now that the time has changed, I pressed perhaps too hard into the little
&gt; &quot;hour&quot; button on my clock, and it's stuck in.  Now the hours continually
&gt; cycle.  Suggestions?

WD-40? Sounds like its time to take it apart to see what makes it 
tick.  Try some blowing some air into the hole maybe there is some 
dirt hanging it up. I bet that the clock is a sealed unit and you 
won't be able to pull it apart to look at the spring contact. The 
contact might be bent or broken. Try something sticky and try to pull 
the button out. If it moves easy then the spring is busted. if it 
won't move then sounds like its jammed... Good Luck..
