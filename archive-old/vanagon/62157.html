Subject: Snorkel Hose Ram-Air Configuration Possiblities 87GL

Volks,
I am considering fabricating a plenum from composites to cup the
backside of the L/H rear air intake vent (the one that is closed off to
the engine comparment/hosts electronics at the bottom). The snorkel hose
runs up to the top but faces backwards, in what I figure is an attempt
to keep it from sucking in rain and throwing water into the air cleaner
box and possibly the engine.
I was thinking that a measurable amount of HP increase would be attained
by using that entire vent/scoop as a ram-air scoop to increase manifold
pressure at cruising speeds.
Questions:
1) Has this been done successfully?
2) Will scooping rain directly into the snorkel hose and air-box be an
insurmountable problem? I was considering gluing in a blister sump on
the bottom of the air-box with a very small hole w/one way check valve
to allow water to be forced out when airbox airpressure would rise at
freeway speeds.

If you read in these High Performance catalogs they sell just air-box
mods with larger
snorkel hose diameter snaked to the front of the vehicle to grab ram-air
and claim an average 15 HP increase on the garden variety 1996 Mustang.
I would be happy with say 5 HP at Freeway speeds on this relatively easy
mod (the snorkel could just be merely turned around to face the
air-stream for some performance increase).
Feedback appreciated.
