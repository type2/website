Subject: Re: Asbestos, Le Coz, Heater Parts, etc.

Since a lot of people have asked me that seem unwilling or unable to 
invest the modest time of using Ken's exceptional &quot;Busted Bus&quot; to 
search the archives, from the ORIGIONAL, origional post here is the 
information on Le Coz.

His address:
Mr. Yves Le Coz, Senior Engineer
Product Liaison Group
600 Sylvan Avenue
Englewood Cliffs, NJ  07632

phone: 201-894-6260
fax:  201:894-5498

I note, I would approach this as your desperately wanting to rid your 
van of that terrifying asbestos, not that &quot;I want new heater parts.&quot; 
Apparently, ANY T4 engined Bus or Vanagon is potentially eligible for 
something.  I also note, don't expect a quick reply, it was nearly 2 
weeks after I faxed him before I recieved a call, and has now been 
nearly a week since I've heard from him but he may be lining up the 
parts for at least my 3 vans worth of work.
