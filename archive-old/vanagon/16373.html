&gt;1. there were NO bussess/vanagons/evans at all.

Actually there was a quick view of Eurovan Winnebago towards the end. But I
was hoping for a lot more bus/vanagon coverage. Was a pretty good video
though. If you did not get it yet just call VW's tollfree number
(1-800-444-vwus) and they'll mail it to you.
