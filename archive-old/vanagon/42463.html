Subject: Peanut butter in oil?

Today when I went to add oil to my bus ('76), I noticed a strange substance
on the inside of the filler tube. It looks like slimey peanut butter. Does
anyone know what this is? Also, what does this mean? Is my engine filled with
peanut butter and soon to self destruct? Has anyone else ever seen this?

Currently boycotting Peter Pan until this is resolved.
Bryce
