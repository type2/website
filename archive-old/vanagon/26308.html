&gt;Subject: I need cylinders only.

I am in the process of rebuilding my 1974 1800cc Westy engine and I have 
found that alot of the cooling fins on the cylinders have been broken 
off. The pistons are in good shape so I am looking for sombody that sells 
cylinders only, not in an assembly package. Does anybody know of a place 
that does this?

Thanks,

Woody
