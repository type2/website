To the guy with the happy name-

If it works out that you can snag the stuff, count me in on a trinket or 
two... I just adore trinkets ;-)

Hey, btw: I assume you passed on the 79 automatic Westy? Hope so! I don't 
know where it is you call home, but up here in Seattle folks have a hard 
time getting any reputable VW shops (non-dealers) to work on automatic buses.
I know firsthand -- I almost bought a 79 westy (auto) myself, til I 
realized the tranny leaked somethin' fierce.  Not a soul would work on it.
So I passed on this beautiful looking vehicle at a *decent* price (2 
grand), and ended up with a fixer-upper 78 westy instead...
Well, I fixed it up (paint, interior, etc) and now that smooth 
running-but-oh-so-cosmetically-challenged camper is my pride and joy!
So, hang in there with your search -- and a tip from me to you: go for 
the strong-runner that needs visual help before you endeavor to revive a 
mechanically pooped-out brick.  It's much easier to cope (financially, 
emotionally, etc) with the former rather than the latter on your first 
bus -- you'll learn the technical stuff at a less frenzied pace. 


Jeff
