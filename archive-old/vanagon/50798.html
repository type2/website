Subject: Replacing seats

I have two front seats from I think a 78 Westy. Is there any easy way to
install them in a 74 Westy or do I have to move the upholstery over to the
original seats?

I am also looking for a good hopefully 2 liter engine and manual
transmission for the 74 in the Toronto area. Any thoughts much appreciated.
