         DMV

I hope that I shall never see
   Again those clods at DMV,
Those cretin-brained misfits of life
   Whose job it is to cause you strife,
Who stand behind that armored wall,
   Protected, as they spout their gall
To people, queued in long slow lines
   To register or pay their fines.

So many hours, stand, and wait,
   The irritation turns to hate,
But hate must hide behind a grin,
   Or else you will not ride again.
These words, I fear, will do no good,
   Will make no changes where they should,
For poems are writ by fools like me,
   But mutant genes made DMV.
