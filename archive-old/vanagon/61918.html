 To the best of my recolection hydraulic lifters run with NO clearance and

You are absolutely right, KD, and that is what I am telling our fellow
VWer...
 
 &gt;If one
 &gt;of your lifters is sleeping, one or more of the measurements will be 
 &gt;slack. 

Hydraulic lifters DO run at nil clearance (at operating temperature), and
should not be adjusted. 

I was suggesting that the fastidious, tinkering driver might 

&gt;...roll the motor to TDC #1 and check the valve clearance, (only to know
that that valve is the problem...

which, of course does not entail adjusting the valves.
