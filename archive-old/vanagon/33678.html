Subject: how to build a factory stearing lock stearing box.


thom asked if i could post this to him.  i let everybody else know how too.

first get ahold of a tight stearing box to build it into.  the tighter 
the better.  usually, the seal will be shot, but i will speak about that 
later.  the bushing and worm gear in the important part.  make sure they 
are tight.  if you can find someone to rebush the shaft, have it done.  
check your shaft for wear.  the worm gear can be adjusted, so check to 
see that it has some adjustment left.  basically, start with a good box.

drain and completely disasemble the stearing box.  they are not real 
complicated inside.  remove the side plate and pull out the cross shaft.  
(clean the end first so that no dirt will scratch the bushing up)  then 
remove the bottom plate and pull out the shaft.  take the woodruff key 
out of the top taper first.

clean everything for reasembly.  remove the old cross shaft seal.  a new 
one can be orderd from King Bearing, INC in santa anna.  (714) 258-8931  
or any other bearing house.  use a seal that is 25x36x8 mm.   they are 
about $6.00.  pres it in carfully.

take your outer stearing collum and do the following.  set it on your 
bunch with the ID plate down.  the cross shaft towards you.  prop it up 
so that it sits level on the table.  the cross shaft shout be paralell 
with the table.  scribe a line all the way up to the top of the shaft on 
the top profile of the shaft as it sits.  this is your centerline.

			here----------&gt;  I
				       /---\
	looking from the end          /     \----I
			              I     I----I
  				      I     I
				      \     /
				       \---/

measure down from the top end 5. 11/16&quot; and scribe a line perpendiculer to 
the center line.  measure 1. 5/16&quot; ans scribe another line.  measure 1/4&quot; 
inch to either side of the center line and scribe lines paralel to the 
centerline.  this is the size of the hole.  use a 1/2&quot; drill bit and 
drill out the top part of the slot.  center the bit 1/4&quot; down from the 
top scribe and drill it out.  the hole is suposed to be flat sidded with 
round top and bottom.  once the top and bottom holes are drilled, use 
whatever you have to open up the rest of the hole.  i used a dremill tool 
with a slitting blade in it.  once the hole is in the collumn, file it in 
a manner that you like.  aka, smoth it out.  after that, paint the collum 
the color you want.

now take the innershaft and put it inside the collumn.  scribe the shaft 
inside the collumn around the cutout you just made.  remove the shaft.  
this is were the collar will go.  go and get a 3/4&quot; piece of plumming 
pipe about 2.5&quot; long.  the ID will be a liitle big, but no problem.  the 
OD is just right.  take a slitting saw or hack saw and cut out a slot the 
length of the pipe about 1/2&quot; wide.  slide the pipe over the shaft and 
line it up with the scribe on the shaft.  the pipe may need to be squezed 
a little with a vise grip in order to make it fit snug on the shaft.  use 
a little clay or wax and &quot;stick&quot; the pipe in place on the shaft.  incert 
it into the collumn to make sure it fits.  it may need a little masaging 
so that is rotates freely.  full the shaft out and remove the wax.  take 
out your welder and tack the pipe in place.  weld it furmly to the shaft 
on teh top and bottom of the pipe.  make sure that you do not lay a bead 
that is wider then the pipe.  it won't fit.  once it has cooled, put the 
shaft back in for a test fit.  if all is good, then resemble the collumn 
and put it back into your bus.  the lock mecanism, (which i still have 
not found)  is installed and then yo are done.  

sounds simple heh?  if you have any question, write back and i will do 
the best i can to help.

take care and God Bless
matt


ps.  does anyone have a extra lock cyclender?  i need one.
