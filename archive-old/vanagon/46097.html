Subject: Re: Nominations for 10 Best cars

&gt; 1)  Largest single model production of all time.
&gt; 2)  Longest production run of all time [1946 to present]
&gt; 3)  If those two are not enough, it is also the vehicle with the
&gt;     geographical distribution of any model of car; it can be found on
&gt;     every continent [save perhaps Antarctica] and in most countries.

Correction Roy: The VW was the main on base transportation for 
Australia's research station on Antarctica, because of the air cooling it 
wouldn't freeze and the rear wheel drive helped for traction in the snow.

Just my 2 cents.
