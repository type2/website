Subject: generator fixed at last!!!

I think I have fixed my elecriacl problems.
As stated before I had only changed the top brush in the generator, because I
could not get to the bottom brush.
What I needed was a make-up mirror and a stubby non-phillips screwdriver.
With the mirror I could see where the screw was and undo it with the stubby I
could get the screw out. 

With the new brush everything seems OK

Let's hope it lasts
