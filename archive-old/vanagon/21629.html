I beleive that it has nothing to do with the position of the
front left wheel in relation to the body.  It's inertia of moving
parts inside the speedometer itself.  If you take a speedometer out
of a vehicle and lift and lower it (even gently) you will notice the
needle moves about as the speedo's innards are subjected to the changing
forces due to gravity and accelleration.  The springs hold the needle
at zero (20 k in mine) in the force of one gravity... If you mess with
gravity god gets really mad and tries to confuse you by wiggling your
speedo needle.   :)
