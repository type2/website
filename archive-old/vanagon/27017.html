Subject: Re: EV at 100 mph?

    Who took the EV to 100 mph? I own a 93 MV and you would be RED 
LINING to get to 100mph, i'll buy 90 mph.

&gt;  Just to add my $.02 to this thread; I saw firsthand one of the
&gt;Winnebago van conversions (NOT the behemoth one) this weekend. The one 
I
&gt;saw had all the options, and was super-nice. If I had $30k to spend on
&gt;one, I might do it. The inside was much roomier than the Vanagon
&gt;westy's, and the refrigerator was about twice as big. The cabinets
&gt;seemed to be laid out somewhat better. 
&gt;The owner (a fellow listmember) said that power was *no* problem
&gt;whatsoever. He said the van was happy cruising at 80mph, and he had
&gt;taken her to 100. Although she is quite heavy, he said there wasn't a
&gt;problem.
&gt;  Overall I was quite impressed, but as I could buy over 20 of my bus
&gt;for what that one cost, and there would be no hope I could ever do 
much
&gt;work on it, I think I'll stick with my split.
&gt;All IMHO
