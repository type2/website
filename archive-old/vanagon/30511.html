Subject: Too much heat?....

When does your air-cooled bus have too much heat.  When the windshield(s)
crack.  Yep, last week I let the ol' bus warm up with the gas heater
blasting away only to find the passenger side windshield with a series 
of large cracks with their origins by the defroster vent.  This weekend
I managed to do the same to the other side.  I gotta remember to turn that
thermostat down abit and never, NEVER, position the flap to defroster mode.
Anyone have some windshield glass for a '65 deluxe?
