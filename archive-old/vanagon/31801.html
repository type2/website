This is the time to talk about the year behind and directions for the
future of the club. We'll be setting up our summer events calender, if you
know about an event coming up please let me know.  I invite anyone and
everyone to attend.  It going to be held at  Dale Ward's home.  Dale is our
membership guy.  Dale's address:
