Subject: Re: HELP! 90 Overheating on Road Trip
Date: Sat, 31 Aug 1996 21:42:10 -0400 (EDT)

&gt; 
&gt; Help!  I'm on a road trip, en route to the Boston to New York AIDS ride, and
&gt; my 90 Westy's temp idiot light keeps coming on about every 115-120 miles.  I
&gt; didn't bring along the Bentley and have no more ideas.  Can anyone suggest
&gt; anything?  I've got plenty of coolant and the fuse to the radiator is OK.
&gt; Its never done ths before.  I stop for five minutes and its OK, then get
&gt; back on the road, set the cruise for 65 and in about 115 miles it does it
&gt; again.  I sat in a parking lot trying to get the engine temp to raise and
&gt; the radiator fan didn't come on...any suggestions?
&gt; 
&gt; I stopped by a friend's place in Ithaca to use his computer, so if you have
&gt; and suggestions, e-mail me back at rrw2_at_cornell_dot_edu, since he's not on the
&gt; list.  And if there is anyone between here and Boston that might know how to
&gt; troubleshoot it, I'd be REALLY glad to hear from you!
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!

Open the front grill and bleed the radiator of air bubbles. I normally do 
it while the engine is still hot. Just be careful not to open the bleed
screw entirely or you may injure yourself from scalding. When the hissing 
stops, and no more air is expelled, tighten up, Refill the coolant in the 
expansion tank. That should take care of the problem for at least several
of hundred miles until the air leaks into the system again. 
						Good luck
