&gt; And other bad news, my case was bad :( so I have to cough up an extra
&gt; $150 for that :( :( :(  unless I can come up with another case, and then
&gt; _I_ have to take it apart, and they'll charge me $25 to clan and check it,
&gt; and if that one is bad, too, then I'm still screwed :( :( :(  

Is that $150 for a new case or a used one?  If new, I would go for it.
If used, I would try to get a new one or find one yourself.

&gt; They gave me the case. It has a small crack in the bellhousing above
&gt; #3.  The motor ran fine with the crack before, so what's the problem?
&gt; Can this case be used for anything?

Those old cases are magnesium, and they can't be repaired.  As they age,
the cases become weaker and weaker.  The best bet is to get a new one, so
you know that your motor has a long life ahead of it.  If you get a used
one, you will probably have no idea how many miles are on it, and it could
crack tomorrow.  That's one of the few benefits of the type IV motor - it
has an aluminum case and can be &quot;welded, and welded again, and welded some
more!  Good thing too...&quot;.

All of the above courtesy of my favorite HP book, &quot;How to Rebuild your Air
Cooled VW&quot;.
