&gt; Has anyone ever removed the top from a Westfalia? I mean the whole unit,
&gt; tent and all;
&gt; right off the body. If for example you wanted to repaint the whole van or
&gt; clean the darn thing; removing the roof would be the way to go. Just
&gt; wondering - DC
&gt; 
I installed a complete top unit on my '78. It already had a sunroof
hole, so everything mouinted nicely. It took about a day to get
everything in place, with no major drilling. Not a bad job to do...and
certainly well worth it.
