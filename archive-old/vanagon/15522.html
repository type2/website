Subject: (fwd) Advice on Vanagon requested.

Saw this on r.a.vw and wasn't sure how to respond, so I thought I'd 
forward it to this group.  PLEASE forward your responses to his email
address            |               and not me.

&gt; 
&gt; I am considering purchasing a 1983 Westphalia Vanagon.  It has AC 
&gt; and a standard trannie, and a new VW engine.  The owner is asking $5900 
&gt; for it.  It appears to be in good condition -- very little rust, but a 
&gt; little mildew in the pop-up section.
&gt; 
&gt; Does this seem like a fair starting price for the above vehicle?  Is 
&gt; there anything I should be especially aware of before plunking down cash 
&gt; for this vehicle?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance!
&gt;
