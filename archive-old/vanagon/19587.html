&gt; I am seriously considering taking them to court. I had a wonderful vehicle up
&gt; to 30,000 miles ( I got an 83 with 140,000 running like an angel) until a bunch
&gt; of crooks and imbecils got a hold of it....Now I have a piece of shit VANAGON.
&gt; 
&gt; Have you driven a FORD lately?

&gt; 
&gt;    Do it! Get a lawyer, it'll be worth the money. Don't even consider
&gt;    being &quot;nice&quot; about it, go for the throat and do not stop until you've
&gt;    drained all the blood from the body. No quarter.
&gt; 

Should I consider punitive damages....say...1 million...Then we could all
hit the BAJA peninsula!
