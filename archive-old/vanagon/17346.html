Subject: FS: 1960 Panel Van


Here's the word:  A local V-Dubber has a 1960 Panel Van which is 
lacking a motor, but come complete otherwise.  The descriptive
word is 'solid'.  No rust on rockers, Wow!!  The rust demon has
visited the driver side floor.  Very straight body, located in 
Raleigh, N.C. (land of tobacky and extremely salty ham products)

the asking price is $1400, the owner is named bruce and is available
at 919-821-0810.  talk to him, he wants to sell it.

sayonara,

agent andy, ESQ
