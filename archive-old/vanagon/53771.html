&gt; &gt; HELP!  I pulled the never-used seat belts up from underneath the rear 
&gt; &gt; bench seat of my '88 GL today, and was horrified to find them wet with 
&gt; &gt; coolant.  I imagine there must be some kind of leak from the rear heat 
&gt; &gt; exchanger.  I seem to remember a thread along these lines a while ago, 
&gt; &gt; but I'm afraid I might not be able to find it in the archives.  Can 
&gt; &gt; someone shed some light on what needs to be done?
&gt; &gt;

   Well remove the 2 bolts at the joint between the valve and the
   heat. You will find a o-ring seal. Clean everything good. Reinstall
   but add silicone seal to the o-ring groove with the o-ring.

      This will fix it!
