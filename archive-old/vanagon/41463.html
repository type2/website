Subject: Pop-top seal and e-mail question

First, does anyone know where you can get the pop-top seal that is all one
one section, like the original.  i ordered one from Bus Boys that was a 20 ft
long piece of seal that keeps falling off and has shrunk about 3 inches
from the Florida heat and humidity.  Lastly, my school is switching from
the Vax to the UNIX server. Should I just resubscribe to the list when I get
my new address and unsubscribe my old address?  Thanks a lot for any help.
