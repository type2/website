Must be one of those days.  I tried to bleed mine today and had no luck.
I can't decide whether I have air in the system or not. The problem I'm 
trying to fix is that the engine temp gauge never reads normal (it's 
always low).  
I'm starting to suspect the temp gauge.  I don't have your problem.
The radiator fan even came on a couple of times, so I KNOW the thermostat 
was open. Of course, if I have a small leak in the front heater core, 
then I could be getting air in there, but why didn't I have the problem 
last spring? I think I'll have to bring it in and have someone pressurize 
the system and find out if it's leaking or not.

&gt; Anyone want to offer any moral support on this?  How long must I live 
&gt; with my VW's nose 1/2 meter in the air?

Just out of curiousity, how did you get your VW's nose 1/2 meter in the air?

&gt; I let the old heifer run for a good half hour.

I let mine run about that long too. I think I'm going to have to put a 
bleeder nipple in for that bolt in the radiator.
