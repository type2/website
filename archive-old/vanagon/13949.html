&gt; &gt; Here's a little mystery.  Otto, the 79 Bus (50,000 on a rebuilt 2000,
&gt; &gt; 161,000 mi. total, completely stock) has, for reasons known only unto
&gt; &gt; himself, started getting getting 19-20 MPG in combined driving, and 21-23 on
&gt; &gt; the highway.  This has been consistent now for over a month.  I've not done
&gt; &gt; anything, mechanical or otherwise, except putting in a new battery 2 weeks
&gt; &gt; ago.  Ever since I bought this Bus, the gas mileage has been 16-17 combined
&gt; &gt; and 18 or 19 on trips.  These figures are based on reality, as I keep track
&gt; &gt; of the mpg's with each fill-up.  I'm not complaining, but this seems a
&gt; &gt; little weird.  
&gt;
&gt; of it, is dieseling even possible with fuel injection?

You know same thing happened to me right before I sold my '76 a
few months ago, I took one last 650 mile trip in her to pick up
a 36hp and a couple 1600's engines a guy had, on the start of the
trip I was getting 15-17 by the end was seeing 21-23, I had to
refill often as my gas float was sunk and I was really paranoid so
I calculated on each fill.  The trip was much the same as far as
terrain in each direction, I was stumped as if anything the prolonged
high speed (averaged right over 60) driving should have blown carbon
out.  Anyway no pinging or any other problems and the good milage
persisted around town for the next couple of weeks before I sold
her.  I just decided not to care. Incidently fuel injection may
diesel if the injectors are so bad they spill a lot of fuel after
closing and this would be addressed immediately as it will also tend
to leak past the rings and thin the oil.  If your engine &quot;makes&quot; oil
instead of the normal VW tendancy to leak it, you better look into that
fi system quick.
