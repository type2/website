&gt;We have some really old crappy stickers on our pop out window (pre us ie over

&gt;gunk/smear. 
&gt;I am afraid of using a scraper in case of scratching the glass. Anyone got any
&gt;ideas?

I've found that the Avon product 'Skin-So-Soft' is GREAT at dissolving the
gunk left behind by stickers.  It's amazing stuff... a true industrial-grade
solvent.
