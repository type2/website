&gt; I didn't explain my engine swap...I want to go with a replacement DIESEL engine	   for my 82 vanagon diesel ...I found a good deal on a low mileage DIESEL 					
	engine  from an 86 jetta DIESEL.
&gt; 
&gt; _it looks like it will fit?? the junkyard guy says no problem!!
&gt; 
&gt; -does the 86 jetta DIESEL engine have more HP than my old 82.
&gt; 
&gt; -do i need to swap over anything other than the oilpan , oil pump pickup tube,
&gt;  fly wheel and clutch assembly.


	I WOULD LOVE TO GO GAS CONVERSION ..JUST DONT HAVE THE TIME..
