Subject: Re: Vanagon Pop-top Conversion Experiences
Date: Wed, 6 Sep 1995 23:49:18 -0500 (CDT)

&gt; I recently bought a &quot;shell&quot; of a '91 Vanagon MultiVan and I
&gt; am considering using the interior and pop-top to convert
&gt; our '87 Syncro into a MultiVan.
&gt; 
&gt; I am wondering if anyone has experience with installing a
&gt; Westfalia pop-top on a Vanagon and what they would do
&gt; different the next time.

I too would be interested in hearing from people who have
converted a normal bus into a pop-top camper.  I'm currently
trying to decide whether to splurge and buy a camper as a 
second bus or to convert my current '79 to a camper.  It
seems as though really nice campers are running $2000-2500 in
this area...a bit steep for me to put out at one time.  However,
the conversion might end up costing more than just buying a 
decent Westy...BUT, it could be done more gradually making it 
a bit more managable financially.  It would carry the 
potential for more frustration though!  ;)  Pros or cons from anyone
who has attempted this operation?  Either way I'm sure I'll have
fun with 'em.
