Subject: Gas Tank Woes...

Buddy of mine has a bug whose gas tank started to leak.  Pin hole at 
first, then further poking produced a larger hole.  He inserted a bolt, 
but of course this did not produce a leak-proof remedy.  I know there's
been some discussion as to coatings and gas tankage problems recently, 
anyone care to fill me in with a remedy?

TIA, 

christian
