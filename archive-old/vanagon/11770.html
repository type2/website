I know this theory from of old, when the oil cooler was mounted right 
over cyl #3, and interfered with the cooling air for this cylinder.  The 
&quot;dog house&quot; shroud was supposed to eliminate the problem by moving the 
oil cooler out of the air path.  Then when the Type IV engine came into 
use, the oil cooler moved to the right rear and really out of the air stream.

Now the question:  Has anyone mounted multiple head temp sensors on (a) a 
1600 with doghouse; or (b) a type IV?  Is there any difference in head 
temp at #3 or is this just &quot;volklore&quot; for the newer engines? (I assume water 
cooling eliminates any &quot;hot spots&quot; {if it isn't leaking})

If there is no difference from design in temps between cylinders, then a 
single temp sensor, wherever you locate it, will monitor only overall 
engine condition.  It will not tell you much about the cylinders it is 
not mounted on.  (I know that sounds silly, but if #3 is &quot;most at risk&quot; 
and #3 reads OK, then you can assume #'s 1, 2 &amp; 4 are good, so a #3 
mounting *would* tell you something useful about the others).  You would 
need to mount 4 sensors, 1 per plug, to learn about each cylinder's 
condition.
