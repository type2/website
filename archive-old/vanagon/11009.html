&gt;&gt;The guy at the garage looked at the service truck and said 
&gt;&gt;- I wouldn't drive a diesel through there.

&gt;Well I wouldn't either.  All you need to do is splash 
&gt;some of that water  into your air intake, have some of 
&gt;that cold water get sucked into your  combustion 
&gt;chambers that are heated to about a million degrees F 
&gt;and &quot;poof&quot;  there goes your engine!  Drive slow, very 
&gt;slow through water with any diesel  automobile.

NOW you tell me!!!

(PS.  Because the air intake is on top of the engine and 
connected to the intake on the bonnet, I was able to go through 
a puddle that a 4x4 wouldn't.  This means :  1.  I am *really* 
dumb  or  2.  He was a yellabelly.)

(And an idiot in a Toyota Hi-Ace (with a LOW air intake on the 
side) tried to follow and couldn't! &lt;cue derisive comments and 
manical laughter&gt; )
