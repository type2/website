Subject:  Re: four-position wiper stalk, 78 bus

&gt;&gt;Couldn't we hook something up so I could deal with all
&gt;&gt;those minivan  drivers who cut me off while talking on their
&gt;&gt;cell phones?

&gt;Sounds good to me. Unfortunately, the surplus gun turrets
&gt;from all those WWII bombers, are pretty much sold out by
&gt;now...

Maybe Q from James Bond's technical department could come
up with something.  Could use it here too.
