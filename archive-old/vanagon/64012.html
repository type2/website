Subject: Downside to EV ownership


Yep...I finally found a major problem with owning an EV. Let me drift back 
to last fall.....whenever I wanted to &quot;get away&quot; from it all and wanted some 
relaxation, I would crawl under the '56 and adjust valves, change oil, fix 
someting...then the '56 got hit and has been in the body shop eversince (the 
owner is doing it at a reduced rate/time available basis)...

Today I worked on my son's (and my former) 86 GTI (&gt;217k miles)....had him 
change the oil....we replaced the front struts...front and rear pads...put 
in a rebuilt alternator....basically I got grease under my fingernails for 
the first time in over 6 months! 5 hours went by fast...the GTI is 
happy...I'm happy....my blood now has sufficient oil in it!

Unfortunately, the EV has yet to require this type of activity! Maybe I'll 
get to change the brake pads soon....I guess that's the downside to 
reliability, etc....Nothing like getting up close and personal with your VW!
