		NO.

It's impossible.  (German engineering strikes again.)

Some things that may help:

1. Remove spare tire.  Make sure the in line, unsupported heater hose
valve is turned all the way off.

2.  While you are there, glue thin sheet of insulating material to the
sheet metal that the radiator air comes down.

3. Remove carpeting.  Glue more insulation material everywhere.

4.  Get can of spray insulation.  Foam everywhere you couldn't get to
with the sheet insulation.

5. Stuff rags in air outlets.
