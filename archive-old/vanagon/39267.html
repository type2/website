Spent most of the day sandblasting the &quot;Bilge Bus&quot; and cutting about 10
pounds of useless metal off.

Interesting discovery: when I went to raise the passenger/left side of
the bus, putting the jack under the spring plate cover, and lifted,
the _entire_ rear of the bus came off the ground, and the front wheels
stayed put!!!!  Weird!!

Anyway, it was a very productive day - I used up about 150 punds of sand,
getting most of the passenger side center underbelly done.

Question:  what is the insulation for the heater duct made of on these
early busses?  I hit it with the sand, and it just exploded in a cloud 
of dust.  Doctor! It hurts when I do that...  My eyes are really irritated
today, too, but I got a lot of sand in them as well.  I'm glad I'm 
using the same respirator-type as when I painted!
