The Arizona VW Bus Club will be driving to the local opening/premier of this
movie in Tempe, AZ on 9/21/95 at 6PM (Cornerstone Theater). The club is
expected to be on the news as the local media has promised to do a &quot;color&quot;
story on the movie etc. Everyone who drives their bus will receive the movie
poster.

BTW: Over $800. was donated to a local childrens crisis nursery as a result
of last weekends Arizona VW Bus Club &quot;Jerome Jamboree V.&quot; Thanks folks!

&gt;I saw an ad for a movie this past weekend called &quot;Tie-Died&quot; an ode to
&gt;Deadheads. The ad showed a split window bus covered in all kinds of
&gt;designs and colors. The movie is playing in only one theater here in Seattle,
&gt;so I don't think it has gone national yet.
&gt;
&gt;A side note...I think I've figured out why many bus(transporter) drivers
&gt;don't wave back. They need to keep one hand on the steering wheel and one
&gt;hand on the stick shift to keep it from poping out! Any attempt to wave
&gt;could prove to be fatal!
