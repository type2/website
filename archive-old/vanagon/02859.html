&gt; actually, it happens all over the place, in every state of the union. where
&gt; do you think politicians come from? ;)

Actually, the local theory is that you hold the election to decide who 
the two people you most want out of the state are, that gets you 
Senators. (and the local competition in Virginia is real stiff this 
year).  The you get more regional and get rid of a couple of 
Congressmen.  After that you send some fools to Richmond....
