                  First time caller!

    Last year I bought a 71' hardtop camper. Great body but needs eng work.
I plan on restoring it this summer. Anyways, It has air conditioning but
the compressor is missing. I planed on fixing the AC but after hearing
all the rhetoric early this week about these old units, I'm not to sure.
Were these units just not effective or was it just to much drag on the eng?
I heard that their is an after market compressor that has little drag on
the eng. Has anyone heard of this brand or Co.? Any suggestions?
