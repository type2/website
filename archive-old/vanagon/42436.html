Subject: Solution: oil pressure valve removal

Greetings all,

Thanks for the many suggestion for removing the oil pressure relief valve.
By far, the most 'doable' came from Bob Hoover. He recommended cutting the
tip off of an old 1&quot; spade bit, and chucking it up in a hand brace. Until I
began teaching this year, I was a woodworker for a living-I have a coffee
can full of old bits. The worst one I could find was a 7/8&quot;, which, once
the center had been hacksawed off, worked like a charm. Next time I'm at my
welder friends house, I'll have him weld a T-handle to the end of the bit
so I can leave the brace in its cabinet; I don't like to get grease on my
woodworking tools.

Ken
