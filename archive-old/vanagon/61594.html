Be aware that US spec parts for VWs are usually available only
&gt;from VW headquarters. Have fun.

Having lived in Europe for 6 years and owned my US spec bus for most of it, I found that it was 
easier to get type IV engine parts from the US than Germany as Vanagon and type 1 motors are much 
more common in Europe.
I did have a blast driving &amp; camping all over Europe though especially on the ferry boats between 
the Greek islands and Italy.
I have a booklet with all of the VW dealers in Europe that I carried with me. Its probably a bit 
dated but if anyone needs that type of information, drop me an E-mail.
