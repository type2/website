Subject: Governors (i.e.-rev limiters)

Hi all, just a quick question.  I'm working on getting my '66 Westy ready
for the road and I was just wondering if anyone out there still has a
governor on their carb.  I mean, it was put there for a reason, right?  At
what RPM is it supposed to intervene?  If I decide to take it off, it
looks like I just need to take the whole spacer-like thing out from between
the carb and the intake manifold and then get shorter studs for the carb.
Is this right?  I just want to get this bus running smoothly for now while I
rebuild another engine for the future and then I can convert to 12v and
blah blah blah.  Thanks a lot.
-Erik.
