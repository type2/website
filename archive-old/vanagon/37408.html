&gt;When I push it down to that lowest position, the wipers
&gt;don't run and nothing else seems to happen either.  What is
&gt;it supposed to do?  Am I turning someone's wipers on and
&gt;off in South Africa?

Hi from South Africa!

On my bus, 1985 VW Kombi, that position operates an
intermittant wiper mode, for drizzle and such like.  The same
was true for my 1972 VW Kombi.
