&gt;Uh, oh, thanks Joel for clearing that up. I was laboring under the
&gt;misconception that this was another inane approach to blowing off steam
&gt;and getting away from having to do any work. I didn't realise that our

under the Chaos theory of All-Encompassing Entropy, everything makes sense
to someone somewhere sometime. maybe. :)

actually, TGIF is an onomatopoeia (the only damn word i can remember from
those english classes!) ... like Bzzzzz or Hissss ... it's the sound you
make when you try to pinch your nostrils to stop a sneeze, but you sneeze
anyway. ;)
