Good idea.  Check your area for industrial surplus stores.  There are
several here in San Diego.  The one I frequent has boxes of such fans,
not just from computers.  They range from 1&quot; square to 9&quot;, and lots of
them are 12V low-amp fans.  I bought one about 3&quot; square that is rated
.17 amps and mounted it behind my fridge to blow air over the coils.  It
is almost completely silent and won't drain the batteries.  Now I just
have to wire it into the thermostat of the refrigerator so that it is
only on when the fridge is running.
