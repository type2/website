Subject: Re: Anyone know where water tank plug can be found?

&gt;Hi All,
&gt;
&gt;Assuming that this is an American model, a regular hose cap should fit
&gt;perfectly, as long as it is the right diameter...  I know this only because
&gt;mine was unscrewed during shipment and fell off during delivery.  I discovered
&gt;that in order to replace it, at that time, I would have had to replace the
&gt;whole sink drain assembly (really stupid situation) in order to get just that
&gt;plug.  I went down to the local H/W store and got a cap that fit perfectly and
&gt;voile'...
&gt;
