&gt;Can any of the list members pass on any info, mainly experiences, about the 
&gt;Jacobs?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Fred Porter

Fred,
I had a Jacobs computer on my 62 Willys Jeep and the most noticeable 
 improvement was extending the life of the points and adding a 'Kill 
 Switch' in the circuit. I think I can say that it did not produce a 
 bad result.

Clay
