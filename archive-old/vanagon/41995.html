Subject: Bracket for front table (westy 1985)

Hi,

Since the PPO (!) forgot to keep the front table, we are looking for
a complete assembly for a front table for a Vanagon Westy (any year
that could fit, I think 80-91). At least, the foot bracket could be
usefull (I know someone that have a 1980 back table pipe that could
be modified for a front table).
