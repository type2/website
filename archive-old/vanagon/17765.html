Subject: ignition pause


Howdy from Hot Hellish FL,

OK, the scenario is that my '85 van is now pausing for one or two seconds 
before starting.  It just sits there, then starts up perfectly well...or 
at least as well as it ever did.

At low speed in all gears, but especially 1st and 2nd it tends to sit and 
gather itself, then take off. 

Any comments?
