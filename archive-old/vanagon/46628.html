Jonathan 'Snuggles' Edwards noted that I wrote:
  &quot;The next morning I was rested and drove I-80 west for a 2600 mile hot 
summer adventure.&quot;  I again appologize for not having said &quot;for a four 
day 2600 mile adventure.&quot;  Sometimes it's not known to a writer just how 
much information they should include so 99% of his/her readers will 
understand and when some shared background information makes certain 
things rather obvious.  In your case, I failed to communicate.  Some 
others apparently filled in what I mistakenly thought were obvious 
logical bridges.  Sorry.  I'll try to improve.


  Then I noted &quot;Your e-mail address appears very like my &quot;beemer&quot; friends 
in Stamford Ct.  Interesting.&quot;

  To which you playfully responded &quot;beemer as in bmw? them's fighting 
words! :P&quot;

  Jonathan, I'm talking about IBM treasury people.
