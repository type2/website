Subject: Almost caught the big fish (71 bus)

As part of my on-going search for a replacement '71 camper, I saw an ad in
the Classified flea (SFBA): &quot;71 Westphalia, refrig, sink _range_, CLEAN,
1700cc, needs engine work, $1100.  Went to see it today, thinking &quot;range?!,
could be the elusive Country Homes siccors-top conversion.&quot;  Indeed, it is a
scissors-top, but a '72, so it's not for me.  Otherwise it's not so bad,
little rust, ratty upholstery but interior intact, all the cool propane
stuff underneath, who knows about the engine.
