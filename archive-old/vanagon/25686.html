Subject: Re: Insurance Industry Regu

                      RE&gt;&gt;Insurance Industry Regulation (was...      9/28/95

In other words, insurance co's are profit-making institutions, as any legit
business must be. But corrupt ones try to jazz it way up, creating 
situations
like you've described.

Any chance that government restrictions before the election, were so severe,
that even legit, clean companies could only lose money? I have no info on 
this
(do you, Cheese? How about sharing your stats with us?), but would sure like 

to find out-- if my rates were lower, I could afford that new engine for my 
'71!

How does one get this info, I wonder? (When pigs fly, if corruption is
that widespread, maybe?) Any suggestions, anyone?

============================
Because I used to be a USAF &quot;Occifer&quot; - I am able to belong to/be insured by
an organization called United Service Automoble Association (USAA).  This is a
member owned major insurance group that has very high industry ratings, very
reasonable rates and very good service.  They also, depending upon their
annual &quot;profits/payouts&quot; will refund a % of your premium.  Their &quot;mission&quot; is
to provide insurance to their members, not to loose money, and provide service
at the best possible rates.

Perhaps there are other similar organizations that provide insurance as a
member service (vs as a profit making entitiy?) and these would be worth
checking out.
