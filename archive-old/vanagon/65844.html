Subject:      Aux Battery in Engine compartment, Good Idea?

Hello,

I've been viewing the list now for several months and really enjoy all of=

the ideas that are exchanged. Thanks! This is my first attempt at asking =
a
question so please correct me if I break an unsaid protocols. ;)

I have an 84 Westy and live in Jacksonville, Florida. I'm going to be
installing an auxillary battery but I am underwhelmed by the amount of
space under the driver's seat for such an installation.  The small space
seems to demand the more expensive gel cell batteries that can be tipped =
on
their side so the terminal posts are out of the way.  Yesterday while I w=
as
replacing the voltage regulator I noticed quite a bit of empty space in t=
he
engine compartment (extreme back right corner) that seems big enough to
hold a LARGE (1000 Amp Hours, $59.00 autoZone) deep cycle battery.  Has
anyone tried this?  Good idea or just brain flatulence?

Regards,

Emmett &quot;Chad&quot;wick Bearden
