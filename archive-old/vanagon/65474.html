    Let's start with some basics. Cooling system should have pressure
    all the time while running. You can test this by squeesing a
    rad. hose.

    Sound to me that you have a bad Rad. Cap. They get clogged
    easy. It should maintain pressure on the system when hot.

&gt; List,
&gt;
&gt;         I have recently gotten an '87 Westy and have been gleaning lots of
&gt; great info from you all.
&gt;
&gt;         Now, I have a question. This van shows lower temps on hotter days and
&gt; hotter conditions such as in town. When out on the freeway, the temp
&gt; goes above the led, when I would think it should go down.
&gt;
&gt;         If I pull over after a run on the freeway, with the higher temp
&gt; reading, the overflow tank overflows. However, the hoses to and from the
&gt; radiator are not hot at all, and the fan is not going.
&gt;
&gt;         In town, on hot days, the rad is nice and warm, the fan operates
&gt; occassionally, and the temp is about in the middle of the led.
&gt;
&gt;         This leads me to believe that the air cooling of the engine while
&gt; cruising on the freeway leads to a water temp insufficient to keep the
&gt; stock 87C thermostat open. When stopped suddenly, the thermostat cannot
&gt; react fast enough to bring the radiator online before the boil-over
&gt; occurs.
&gt;
&gt;         My question is this: Has anyone explored this problem before? Has
&gt; anyone put the 80C thermo from the '79 Audi 5000 in? (I did this
&gt; morning, but have yet to test it)
&gt;
&gt;         Any suggestions?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Brendan
