You might want to consider a 225/60 R 15 which should size very close land
give you more options on the tires.

&gt;QUESTIONS:
&gt;
&gt;Are they correct in saying that the Borbet wheels are &quot;correct&quot; for the VW
&gt;Vanagon/Westy? As they are 15&quot; wheels, they do require a larger tire.
&gt;
&gt;205/70 R14 tires measure 25.3 inches
&gt;vs.
&gt;205/65 R15 tires measure 25.5 inches
&gt;
&gt;If the Borbet wheels are appropriate, and will cause no problems - would you
&gt;go this route?
&gt;


Take care...Bob
