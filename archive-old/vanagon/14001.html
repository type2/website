&gt;Also, when I positioned the distributer drive shaft, I
&gt;didn't get it exactly in the same place that it was when
&gt;I removed it, and the result is that when the number 1 cylinder
&gt;is at top dead center, the rotor points roughly perpendicular
&gt;to the case parting line.  This shouldn't matter, right?
&gt;Alls it means is that I'll have to rotate the distributer
&gt;to a slightly different orientation, right?


I goofed when I rebuilt my last 1600, only my dist. shaft was 180 degrees
off.  I didn't want to start all over, so I just repositioned the
distributor, and plugged the wires in some crazy way that worked, but no
one else could ever tune.  It worked.  What you have is way better than
what I had.

But I'll never make the same mistake again.  

I heard that you can take a broom handle and shave one end down to make a
sort of giant screwdriver that fits into the slot of the dist. drive shaft.
 The wood gives it more friction needed to sort of twist and lift that out
partially, rotate it into place, and push it back down again.
