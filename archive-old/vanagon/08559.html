Subject: getting 1 piece drum off
Date: Thu, 22 Dec 1994 12:01:26 +0000 (GMT)
From: Marcus Grant &lt;mty016_at_coventry.ac_dot_uk&gt;


I'm trying to remove one of the one piece drums from the
rear of my bus (I want to replace the brake shoes and
handbrake cable). The left side one came off easily, but
this one just dosn't want to know.

I've tried heating it, but no joy.
Any ideas?
TIA
