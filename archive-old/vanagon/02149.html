&gt;I always got the cheapo bottom of the line General tires for my

&gt;I think, just as indicated on the steering column.
&gt;Do you think going to the $60 reinforced buys you about three
&gt;times the lifespan and handling? Jens.

lifespan, no. handling, yes! i used to run el cheapo passenger tires on my
old 1971 bus, and then i put the steel-belted radials with the reinforced
sidewalls on, and was really surprised at how much better it felt. so i
kept running them.

then one year, i let myself get talked into putting some non-reinforced
sidewall tires on an 86 vanagon. :( never again.

imho, the reinforced sidewalls is the only way to go for a bus. whether it
be a light truck tire or a reinforced passenger tire, i think it's worth
the extra money. or at least, i'm willing to pay for it. :) YMMV.
