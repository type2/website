 &gt; 
&gt; To summarize, during the 2 months since I bought the van, the dealer has =
&gt; replaced:
&gt; 				O2 sensor
&gt; 				Water temp sensor
&gt; 				Fuel pump
&gt; 				Fuel filter
&gt; 				Air flow sensor
&gt; 				ECU
&gt; 				Some sort of idle relay
&gt; 
&gt; After each of these disturbances, it runs okay for as much as 50 miles =
&gt; or as little 5 miles, but when the symptoms return, they then recur =
&gt; every 30 seconds, requiring a quick &quot;switch off, switch on&quot; (rebooting =
&gt; the ECU) to keep running.  (Since the dealership is 50 miles away, it =
&gt; only takes about 100 reboots to make the trip.)  I have perused the mail =
&gt; dealer is continuing to experiment, I'm just about ready to give up.
&gt; Thanks,

       I had a very similar problem that the dealer could not fix!
       It was the middle of the winter and I didn't have a place out
       of the snow to work on it. So I thought a VWoA dealer was the 
       best thing. Man was I wrong. They wanted to put a computer in.
       6 weeks later after the snow was melting I fix it by replacing
       a wire. I simply traced out every wire in the engine compartment
       from the computer to the engine. Found the temperature sensor
       not making a connection. Pulled on the wire right there in the
       engine compartment where the engine rocks and found the break.
       I then replaced the entire wire to the computer. I haven't has 
       that problem since.
    
       Your symptoms sound just like mine. The only other thing I 
       know of that will can cause these symptoms is the O2 sensor. To
       check this just disconnect the single wire plug. This is a good 
       temperary check. Or a temerary fix to get you home.

                 let us know what you find
                     
     P.S. I have now found this as a regular problem in 4 Vanagons.
