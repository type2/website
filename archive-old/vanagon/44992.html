Subject: Vanagon Sleeper Conversion??

I have an 85 Vanagon that began life as a Transporter (although it 
says Vanagon on the back door), with no side windows. It has been 
camperized with the addition of a windowed sliding door, an 
aftermarket window in the drivers side, and a bed, plus some 
furniture.

I'd like to put a Westphalia type pop up sleeping compartment on top 
but can see that the conversion of a true Westphalia top would be 
horific. 

Does anyone know of aftermarket conversions that would be 
simpler/cheaper but would still allow two to sleep up top.

Alan
