RE:	Copy of: '84 VANAGON A/C &amp; OTHER MYSTERIES

&gt;One last great mystery...  On the dash just to the left of the lighter 
&gt;socket is a smaller socket. It is a type I have never seen before. It 
&gt;is only about a third the size of  the lighter socket and no mention 
&gt;is made of it in the manual? It could be aftermarket, but it doesn't 
&gt;look like it. Haven't checked it out with the multimeter yet or tried 
&gt;to follow the line behind the dash (if there is one). Is this familiar 
&gt;to anyone? What is it and what is it for?

It's the &quot;European only&quot; outlet for accessories. All '74-'84 Westfalias have
this. I have an accessory spare tire air compressor which plugs into here, and
it has a male plug made by Hella.  I have also seen a accessory cigarette
lighter that fits this outlet too, the plug also made by Hella. I have been told
that you can get the male plugs from Hella, and wire any accessory to the plug.
