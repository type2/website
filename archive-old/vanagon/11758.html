&gt; &gt; NOOOOO!!!! Please do NOT send subscription and unsubscription requests to

&gt; You got that right Gerry!

&gt; In more ways than one!  What a week!  :(

My apologies to Gerry, Steven and any who might have been misled/troubled by my 
PASSING GAS on the listserv.  I wanted to help the guy get off quick since we 
are a prolific bunch, but I was going from memory rather than checking the 
facts/FAQ's.  What I don't get is why someone would want to get off in the first
place.  Go figger.
