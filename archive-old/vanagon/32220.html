Subject: '73 Bus accelerator linkage

I have a '73 1600cc type II bus, which I got on the 2nd Dec '95 (so I 
 am new to all this).

I just had my accelerator cable snap on me. Okay you say, that's easy 
 to replace, but.....

I took it to a garage, and he said that someone has used a pre '69 
 accelerator cable, and had to make modifications to the '73 linkage to 
 fit it. He also told me that I have a Beetle engine in her.

now the questions:

I want to put a '73 linkage kit into the bus, but does anyone know if 
 it will fit onto the Beetle engine?

The chassis no: is 2332070728
Engine no: AD 699 795
Carb : Solex 34 pict-3

Also, (and I know how silly this sounds) The engine doesn't have an air 
 filter on it (or I don't think so). What sort should I put on?


thanks,
andy
