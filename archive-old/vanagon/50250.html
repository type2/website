&lt;&lt; I'm think I'm becoming a fan of you.  One of these days, I'm going
 to have to grill you for even more detailed info. about your vans
 setup.  One thing I've been wanting to ask you is, does San Diego
 have those on-ramp/off-ramp smog sensing setups?  I was wondering
 if this is a concern for the way you have your van set up.  If it's
 still okay while driving through those test zones, I'd really like
 to do the same mods you have done.    &gt;&gt;

Thanks Steve, the Edbuzz fan club will except any and all donations...large
bills preferred....OK,OK,...
I have recently relocated to Portland, Or. from S.D. and, thank goodness
there is no smog check here...no smog sensors here...no smog...wait a
minute...maybe a little 2 days a year...anyway,they are putting those on-ramp
sniffers in SD this year.You would be correct in assuming that the sniffers
would detect the subject modified vehicle putting more emissions in the air,
but I have my doubts regarding the ability to regulate the accuracy of the
infrared sniffers(they take a photo/ir reading of the air) and the legal
grounds upon which they intend to enforce the ticket, ie: how will  they be
able to tell the emissions from your vehicle from the 200 others which sat at
the ramp 5 minutes before you, and once emissions enter the uncontained air,
how will they specify, and maintain for evidence, the smog spew? I can see
the sharks...I mean attorneys in Ca. eating this one up.Have they installed
the sensors up in Sacramento yet?....Thanks for the complement Steve, I will
try to prepare a file of potential mods I have found work for all to
view...and use at their own risk,off-road of course.See ya.
