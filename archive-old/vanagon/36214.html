Subject: Multiple battery questions...


&gt;These questions have been answered in detail before.  I am too tired to
&gt;rewrite a long answer at the moment, but plenty of info should be
&gt;available by searching the list archive.  Someday I'm going to write up
&gt;a FAQ on this stuff (or has someone already done it?)

See the offroad FAQ. The hard-core Jeep guys run things like front &amp; rear
winches and onboard welders. Unbelievable amperage. They understand
multi-battery setups very well.

&gt; Offroad server for FAQ, digest back issues, bibliography, etc. Put the
&gt; word &quot;help&quot; on a line by itself in the body of a message and mail it to:
&gt;        offroad-server_at_ai.gtri.gatech_dot_edu
