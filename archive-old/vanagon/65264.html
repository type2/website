Subject:      Help-need mass air flow sensor

My previous post about &quot;cold start stalling&quot; has turned out to be a bad
mass air flow sensor.  VW has one in stock but I can't mortgage my house
for that much money!  Does anyone have an aftermarket source for a new
(reliable) one that I could get &quot;overnighted&quot; to me?   Appreciate
responses, leaving on trip Friday.

Thanks,
