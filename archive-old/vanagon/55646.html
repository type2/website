Subject: RE: Questions About Buying Diesel Westi 


---
&gt;If anyone has any opinions or comments about owning a diesel Vanagon, 
I would appreciate it.
&gt;
&gt;Also, I have never owned a diesel powered vehicle.  I am wondering:
&gt;    - Are these diesels mechanically reliable?

Not as long-lasting as the same engine put into a little Rabbit. I got
about 130K out of my first engine.

&gt;    - How long will they typically last (miles)?
&gt;    - Are they rebuildable?

You can get them rebuilt, or buy a &quot;long-block&quot; rebuilt, my current
engine was pulled from a Dasher, and it was rebuilt 40K miles before 
the transplant.

&gt;    - Any potential design problems?

It rev's real high at higway speeds

&gt;    - What should I look for when considering a used diesel Vanagon?

Look for &quot;blowby&quot;. Is it leaking oil from the seals? Excessive 
ring-wear will allow air to blow-by the rings into the crankcase. The 
pressure inside the cylinder is much higher for the diesel. If you 
replace the seals on a bad engine, the internal engine pressure will 
force them out again.

On list (former) member (Stuart Hutton) had so much blowby that it 
would force the oil-filler cap off due to the pressure.


Also, beware, some of us have real sucky heat. The diesel engine is so
efficient that there isn't that much heat left over to heat the cabin.
I  am fixing my auxiliary bunker-burner as soon as I have time...

&gt;
&gt;I am aware of the lack of power, and the higher gas mileage is 
motivating me.

30 MPG!

&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance.
