Subject: Push rod tube seals, '81 van

Hi all,

The push rod seals on my '81 van are leaking oil. It doesn't seem too bad a
job to replace them, but the guy in the shop reckoned that they start to
leak again after a few thousand miles. (They were sold out, so I don't yet
have the replacements) So...

1) Is it really worth changing them? (I get a new oil spot on my driver each
time I start the engine, but does it get worse?)

2) Are there any tricks to prevent them leaking again?

TIA,
