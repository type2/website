&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;	Tracey,
&gt;&gt;	On Type IVs there's a thermostat on the bottom of the engine
&gt;&gt;that drives a couple of flaps at the top to control the flow of
&gt;&gt;cooling air. I think your 72 has an 'upright' Type II motor, which
&gt;&gt;may or may not differ from a Type I. I just bought the Bay Window/Breadloaf/
&gt;&gt;68-79 Bus Bentley book and I'll look-up thermostats tonight.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;	Thermostats are popularly left off aircooled engines by 
&gt;&gt;silly people who assume that more cooling is always better- which makes
&gt;&gt;it hard for the engine to warm up, blah, blah.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;	My 914 came without a thermostat and I installed one, but
&gt;&gt;I can't say I noticed any difference. It just made me feel better :-)
&gt;&gt;

Bill:

You are wearing your cylinders fast when driving with cool engine. Fast warm
up is a must to reduce cylinder wear.
