Subject:      vice or vise?

     Please-

     Oh, I tried to sit on my hands - tried to walk away from the computer
     - tried to calm myself with recollections of my own fauxpaus - but to
     no avail!

     I couldn't help chuckling as my mind raced through all the funny
     images of what a vice grip might be.  (Handshake from Al Gore;
     technique the vice squad uses to apprehend hookers, bookies, and
     pimps; what?)

     'Course I knew that a Vise-Grip(TM) was a very handy tool to have in
     one's toolbox.

     Sorry!

     -Blaine
