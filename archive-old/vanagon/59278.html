&gt;
&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt;
&gt; There have been several postings recently concerning overheating of
&gt; wasserboxers in traffic and as the Summer

&gt; 6.  I NEVER fill the crankcase oil level to the top of the operating
&gt; range
&gt; on the dipstick.  I always keep the oil level between the bottom of
&gt; the
&gt; operating range and 1/4 up from the bottom.  This lowered my oil
&gt; temperature (VDO drain plug sensor and electric gauge) from 255
&gt; degrees F
&gt; to 185 degrees F at 70 mph on a 80 degree day!  Usual oil
&gt; temperature is
&gt; about 175 degrees F even in 30 degree weather.  Before reducing the
&gt; oil
&gt; level, hot idle oil pressure was sometimes 1-2 psi.  Now it is
&gt; generally 10
&gt; psi.  Hot, 3000 rpm oil pressure is 30 to 40 psi now.  The oil
&gt; warning
&gt; light and buzzer came on a few times before I made these changes but
&gt; they
&gt; never come on now.

Is there any reason to explain item 6? I have a 1990 Vanagon with
104,000 miles that hasn't had any engine work in the past 30,000 miles
and I would like to put off any required work as long as possible.
Engine oil temp is an important parameter in how long the engine lasts.
I currently don't have any problems with my van's oil warning coming on
but I now live in Southern California where the temps in the summer go
above 100 for days at a time. Anything I can do to reduce oil temp this
summer should reduce my workload. Thanks for any info you can pass on.
