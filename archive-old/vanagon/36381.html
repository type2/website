Brian Verbeek:
Was nice enough to enlighten us in the US &lt;if not only Rusty VanBondo&gt;:

Yes, But a 34Hp exists as well, the engine that is known in the US as the 40
Hp has 34Hp when it's complete with generator, cooling system and exhaust
system, that's why VW specified 34 DIN* Hp for this engine. So forgive us
europeans for talking about a 34 hp :)

Rusty/Ellis stands corrected. I keep telling you all that VanBondo is no
guru. I just throw some pretty good BS (bus stories). Thanks for the info!
