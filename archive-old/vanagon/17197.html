Subject: Don't Use: Click type torque wrench?

For some reason, throughout my repair microfiche, my manual urges again and
again something like: 

Do not use inaccurate click type torque wrench

Every time I read that I go &quot;Uh!&quot; and then I wonder how inaccurate these
wrenches are likely to be.
