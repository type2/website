Subject: Re: EV paint finish rust


I'm getting little &quot;pin-prick&quot; rust spots on the back hatch on my EV, and a 
couple of spots on the seams. It's my understanding that this is 
common....but being common is no excuse.

Its surprising to see on a VW, because the paint quality on VWs has 
generally been very good. However there may be an explanation as to the 
rust...and that is they type of paint used on EVs and other VWs produced in 
Germany since late 92. 

The paints are water-based, environmental friendly paints. As opposed to the 
traditional laquers or enamels which are chemical based. There was a big 
sticker on the window on my EV when I bought it explaining that fact (along 
with the use of recycled plastics, the CFC-free refrigerant, etc), and when 
I went to Wolfsburg back in 94 my guide explained how the whole painting 
system had been recently re-built to handle the water-based paints.
