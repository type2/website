Subject: Oldest Vanagon on the list - Results!

Vanagonites,

Last week I posed the question &quot;Who has the oldest Vanagon on the list??&quot;.

The feedback I got was: 
R&amp;R GREAKER, BELGREAKER_at_gnn_dot_com                           25A0006040
Jack Bateman, jrbateman_at_frick.speedline_dot_ca4                      25A0006115
Dennis Gentry, gentry_at_serv_dot_net
                                                 25A0006407
Jeff Carver, CARVER_JEFFREY_at_aphub.aerojetpd_dot_com    25A0007484
Jeff Carver  CARVER_JEFFREY_at_aphub.aerojetpd_dot_com    25A0021024
Joel Walker, JWALKER_at_UA1VM.UA.EDU                             25A0023906
Zeidler Helmut, zeidler_at_NTCNTG02DU.ntc.nokia_dot_com       25A-0108-790
Charles Webb, cwebb_at_teleplex_dot_net
                                       25A-01222-556

Thus making R&amp;R GREAKER's #6040 the oldest Vanagon on the Vanagon or Type2
lists.  Well, the oldest that responded anyway.

R&amp;R wins a brand new, all improved, genuine, original.....pat on the back and
the admiration of his piers for taking care of this esteemed &quot;old Vanagon&quot;!

Jeff Carver had collected several previous entries and asked:
&quot;All the VIN's I received started with 25A not 24A, what gives? I wonder.&quot;

In 81 to 91 Vanagons the 25 in the VIN indicates a van body style while 24
indicates a pick-up truck body style.  Appliying that to the 1980 Vanagons
would mean that all these entries were van bodies.
