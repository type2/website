Subject: Re: Headlight oddity


&gt;&gt; The headlights on the V6anagon (sorry to cause offense, Jim) have been
&gt;&gt; acting a little strange: after being on for 1/2 hour or so during a
&gt;&gt; long night trip, they lose power. Later they come back on, and then go
&gt;&gt; off again, etc.
&gt;
&gt;Two words:  Chevy alternator.

Well, the lights have worked without problem for several months. It's only
recently that this has cropped up.

But that Chev alternator does have a few odd characteristics. When I
first start the engine, the alternator light stays on, and voltage at
the battery is rght around 11.5 to 12 volts-- obviously the alternator
isn't alternating, and the battery is discharging as it supplies current
for ignition, lites etc. When I rev the engine to about 3,000 rpm,
suddenly the alternator light goes out, the headlights bet brighter, etc.,
and system voltage now measures around 13.6V. After that, the system
operates correctly Seems to take a while to energize the alternator's
coil enough for it to bootstrap itself into producing electricity.


&gt;BTW, Steve, I found a new engine for you to put into your Vanagon.
&gt;That cool Audi W-12!  It might fit!  &lt;grin&gt;

Why buck a trend? The Chevy engine doesn't fit. But otherwise it's fine--
let me know if you find any takers!  :^)
