Subject: '72 Westfalia for sale

This is for sale just down the street from my house (Sedona, AZ):

1972 Westfalia, 75K original miles
Good brakes &amp; Suspension, runs great
$1800  602 284-1132  leave message

I don't know anything about this vehicle.  It looks straight, not many
dents.  The top looks almost new.  Tires are not too worn.  Looks like
the cabinet with the sink is missing.

Dave
'71 Westfalia &amp; SB
