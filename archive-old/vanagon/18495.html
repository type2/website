Subject: Steering wheel and hubcap


I have a couple of thing I do not have the heart to throw
away and am hoping someone in the group could use.

My 84 Vanagon came with a steering wheel from a
VW GTI.  The steering wheel has four buttons on it
for the horn and off center it says GTI, lower right
corner I believe.  I saw the picture of it in the Parts
Place catalog and noticed they can be pretty 
expensive.  It has a nice leather wrap on the grip
also.   It is in good shape.

I also have one hub cap, I believe an original, grey plastic
and says vanagon on it, in pretty good shape.  I threw out the other
two I had since they were beat, but his one only has a couple
of scratches.

Lets make a deal.
