&lt;&lt; I used a couple of remanufactured heads ofrom GEX on my 82' Vanagon (2.0L,
 aircld, fi) during a rebuild in 94'. Recently, I blew a head gasket, so
 have done a partial teardown.
 
 Pistons and cylinders are A o.k. (from GEX as well), but both heads need
 to be completely rebuilt (after only 15K miles). Several of the guides and
 valves are shot and apparently the inside of the head wasn't properly
 machined (GEX ?). Cost of rebuild is near the same as cost or rebuilt
 heads from GEX. Given my luck with GEX and the reliability and experise of
 my local machine shop, I'm having the machine shop do the rebuild.

My experience has shown that blown head gaskets on these engines are almost
always caused by a case that is no good. The case is either warped or twisted
due to heat or the center bearing web wearing out or the cylinder seats are
worn out.  In either situation, the cylinders do not sit perfectly level so
the head will not seal properly for any lenght of time.  I learen this the
hard way a few years ago.  Place straight edge over cylinders before
installing head. Same edge should rest on both inner and outer walls of both
cylinder at same time.  If there is any clearance on one wall, block is
basically junk.  Proper repair includes machining case center flange,
cylinder seats, align bore etc.  Factory rebuilds excel in this area.  Hope
this helps.
