&gt;&gt; My  heart is so heavy tonight.
&gt;&gt; If it were not for the Grateful Dead and Jerry Garcia I would not have:
&gt;&gt; -the intrest I have in VWs and my '76 Camper
&gt;&gt; -my girlfriend
&gt;&gt; -my BEST friends
&gt;&gt; -lots of friends I have not met yet who wave or would stop if I was on
&gt;&gt; the side of the road because they saw a Dead sticker
&gt;&gt; -the intrest in the varied styles of music that I do
&gt;&gt; -and lots more
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Right after work today I went to he drug store and bought shoe polish. On 

&gt;&gt; the back window of my van it now says &quot;Jerry Garcia RIP 8/1/42 - 8/9/95&quot;
&gt;&gt; and on a side window &quot;He was a friend of mine&quot;.
&gt;&gt; Please don't make fun, there are so many out there hurting right now.

&gt;Gary, I couldn't have said it better myself. I've seen a lot of kidding
&gt;around about his passing. Jerry was a real person. He made real music. He
&gt;deserves some respect. I have many fond memories of going to see them
&gt;since as far back as 1969. They brought me joy. Jerry will certainly be
&gt;missed!

     Although I wasn't around in '69 I've been around long enough to
     appreciate the sometimes subtle,  sometimes overt connection
     between Jerry Garcia, the Grateful Dead and VW's.

     Jerry's music, to me,  was and is both reasuring and  challenging.
     He spoke to me in fundamental terms.  He will be missed.
