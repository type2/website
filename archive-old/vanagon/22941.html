Subject: new engine for '66, some questions



Hi all,

  I've been enjoying reading this list, just haven't had much to say
lately.  Well, I'm getting started on another project...

  After much reflection I have taken the first step toward building
a less then optimal engine for my '66 bus.  I bought a core engine
from a junk yard. (I need a case and one cylinder head)

  The '66 bus in question came to me with it's original engine in
pieces and a big hole in the top of the case.  The original owner
said a connecting rod had come through that hole the last time the
engine was running.

  In the last year I've read much about the type I engine.  Tom
Wilson's book, John Muir's book, Bob Hoover's excellent &quot;sermons&quot;,
and a bunch of Gene Berg's &quot;commandments&quot;.  All of these contain
a wealth of useful information.  They also all point out various
things the amateur engine rebuilder can do to make his or her
rebuilt engine stronger, more powerful, and longer lasting.

Some of these things are:

1. Dog house fan housing for better cooling.
2. Full flow oil filter.
3. Hydraulic valve lifters. ($$)
4. Balance the flywheel-pressure_plate-crankshaft-pulley combo.
5. Balance the pistons and connecting rods.
6. Volumetric balancing (cc-ing the heads and adjusting deck height).
7. Use a new engine case. ($$)
8. Use a Sand Seal (and appropriate alternative crankcase ventilation).

(any obvious omissions?)

A couple of years ago I rebuilt the 1700 cc type IV engine in my '72 bus.
Most, but not all, of the above considerations have been addressed by
these newer engines.  The case is made from better material, the oil
cooler is better, they have full flow oil filters, the case is better sealed,
and, in later models, (1975 and later) there are hydraulic valve lifters.
Of course you still have to balance the engine dynamically and volumetrically
yourself.  This engine is still running well after 12000 miles.

Now all of these things cost money and I had been waiting until I could
scrape together enough to build an engine (stock size, 1500cc, single port)
including every one of these enhancements so that I would end up with a
rock solid, last a very long time, never overheat, good oil pressure at
all times, engine.  Well, I've decided to spend less money, build a
sub-optimal engine, and get the bus on the road so I can enjoy driving it.

The only concessions to longevity I plan to make are that I will:

1. Use a dog house fan housing and oil cooler.
2. Use a full flow oil filter.
3. Dynamically balance the engine
4. Volumetrically balance the engine

And even these things depend on cost.  (it looks like I'll be better
off building a 1600cc engine since the jugs 'n pistons are less expensive
than their 1500cc counterparts(!).)

Now a couple questions.  (many more later :-)   )

I have the original distributor.  Various sources tell me that these
distributors retard the #3 spark by 4 degrees to keep that cylinder from
over-heating due to the warmer air it received from the non-dog-house
oil cooler.  If I put on a dog-house cooler, should I get a new distributor
that doesn't have #3 retarded?  I expect the engine would run smoother.(?)

Also, this bus has an after-market air conditioning unit on it.  Against
conventional wisdom, I'm thinking of using it.  Does anyone have any
information about how many horse-power a modern air-conditioning compressor
uses?  I've heard 3-5 HP and that doesn't sound too bad.

I am also wrestling with 6 volt to 12 volt conversion question.  I'm thinking
of leaving it 6 volt for now and changing later.  I know I'll have to drop
the engine when I finally do convert so I can change the flywheel.  Anyone
have any information on the bottom line cost of doing the 6 to 12 volt
conversion?  Also, does the transmission bell housing have to be clearanced
when I convert?

Thanks for any replies,

 -Dyer
