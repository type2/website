Subject: Surprising Syncro Sighting

Right down the street from my house in Santa Cruz last weekend, on CA
Hwy 1 going north: a white Syncro Crewcab circa '89 (?), kicked myself
for not noticing the license plates.  With surfboards in the back.  And
this was not one of those showboats - it was a working truck, sporting a
few dings and primer spots on the back.

Amazing what you begin to notice once you've been carefully trained...
