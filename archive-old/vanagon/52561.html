Subject: Dead '91GL

I am about to search the archives for solutions but perhaps someone has the
answer at their fingertips.

My daughter's '91GL with 120K refuses to start. Now and then it vaguely
thinks about firing but it quickly forgets what it was up to.

The problem came on fairly quickly, I think. The car was fine last Monday
when we changed the water pump. I know it started at least 3 times after
the work was completed. Then it apparently got harder to start.

I have checked to ensure there is spark at the plug(at least one), fuel to
one side(took out the injectors) and all the electrical connections seem to
be OK.

I have read Bentley but there is not much trouble shooting help. I suspect
the air throttle but I'm a bit frightened to start screwing around with
meters for fear of messing up the electronics.

Is there really any good way to check the electronics that might be keeping
it from starting?

Any ideas will be greatly appreciated.

Herb
