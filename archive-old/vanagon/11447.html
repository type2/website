Wolf u got it.    The accelerator pump tube was missing.  The next question
I was CONCERNED with was: Where was it.  Did it fall off when I was soaking
it. Did it go into the intake?  (The rough running engine gave me great
concern.)  A buddy convinced me I threw the baby out with the wash as he
handed me a spare accelerator pump tube.  He also insured me that an 
assembled carberator would prevent a loose accelerator pump tube from 
coming out and falling (or sucked) into the intake.  Reinstalled the 
spare APT into the carberator, installed carberator, and started it up.
Again, very rough, puff of smoke, then smooooth.  Wow, I guess I threw
the APT out with the GUNK.  Down the road for a quick spin.  Accelerator 
throttle stuck wide open!  Back home quickly.  Carberator off - spare
APT wedged in the throttle!  Maybe the first one went through the intake
into one of the cylinders.  Anyway, MAKE SURE the accelerator pump tube
is seated very tightly into the body of the carberator before reassembly
because it can come off even after assembling the two portions of your 
34 PICT-3 carberator.  
	Foo ran fine for about another 50 miles, before I lost function
of one of my cylinders.  Went to do a compression test and found cylinder
1 had a flattend spark plug (no gap!) Ouch ... my biggest fears.  There's
where my APT went.  Compression was excellent though!  Ran the engine with
the spark plug out just in case it was still floppin' around somehow in 
there.  It being the coldest time of the year up here in the North East, I 
didn't have the perseverance to pull the head for the appropriate check (I
have no garage either).  Anyways, new plugs and a 1000 mi later every thing
seems alright.  I'll let you know if anything develops.  I'm finally
getting the courage to turn up the radio and the grip on the steering wheel
is now only to compensate for the play in the steering.
