Subject: Re: Vanagon Throttle Switch

Hi folks-

Had a problem with hesitation and idle on my 87' Syncro this week.  The
engine would idle around 2000 rpm and would severly hesitate just after
pressing the pedal.  The idle could not be adjusted by turning the mixture
screw.  I checked the throttle switch and found that the switching point gap
was too large, and I could not seem to get it adjusted. ( the switch was all
gunked up with crap).  I got a new one from VW ($69.00)!!!!! yikes, but all
is well now.  By the way, the dealer indicated that he has seen this happend
in many vanagons 86' and up.
