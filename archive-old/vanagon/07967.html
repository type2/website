Subject: propane fridge blows out: 1 solution!
Date: Sun, 11 Dec 1994 11:35:46 -0700 (MST)

Hello gang,
Here is one solution for the propane fridge blowing out while driving.
Normally, however, I don't drive with the fridge running off of propane.
Anyway, as it turns out, I park my vanagon on 1 side of the street in
front of my house, and an almost identical twin (same color, 1 year
earlier) parks on the opposite side of the street.  Thus, one often
sees twin campers here.  Now to get to the point of all this:
My twin has cut a plastic milk bottle up and made a wind shield from
it.   The shield extends about 1 inch out from the vanagon body and
is attached with rubber cement.  It is about of a circle.  The owner
says that this eliminated all his problems with flames blowing out while
driving.  Here is a picture ....

Although I don't use the propane while driving, I am considering using
this anyway to keep the fridge from blowing out while in a high wind.
