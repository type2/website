Subject: Paint colors (again/correction)

I don't remember if the discussion regarding the application of Pearl White
was on this or &quot;the other&quot; list. I mentioned that Pearl was not &quot;correct&quot;
for the bumpers and the wheels with possible inclusion of the poptop section
of a 65-67 Westy. I stand by this but am open to correction. The alternative
color I mentioned was something like &quot;Arctic White&quot; or whatever. Last night
I looked at home for the Volksworld article from last summer/fall (Sept
'94?) which listed all of the colors and the factory application per year.
Sorry no luck. I did find the color references for the '67 Westy that I keep
blabbing on about.

L512- Velvet Green
L87- Pearl White
L82- Silver White (NOT &quot;Artic&quot; White)

The research that I have conducted concluded (at least in my brain) that the
L82 Silver White is correct for the wheels and bumpers *For at least the
green/ white color/colour combo. I know that the Mango green uses a gray
white but don't know the real name or code. I appreciate the efforts of
other list members who are also researching this information. A search will
continue for that magazine that was mentioned. Possibly Lee Griffiths or
other UK folks would have this issue handy.  (?)  

It also seems to me that the black and white covered catalogue from &quot;Vintage
Parts and Restorations&quot; had chassis numbers listed but don't recall whether
paint code application numbers were also included.
