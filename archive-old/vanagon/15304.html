If you can't tell, I'm a gadget person and will buy 'stuff' then figure out what to use it 
for :)

Just wanted to add some testimonial to Martha's messages on the list.

I purchased the &quot;stove-To-Go&quot; and was impressed iwth it at the first use.

My youngsters generally humor most of my moods. To my surprise two of the young 
one's were immediately attracted to the stove. Not long ago, my daughter asked if she 
could borrow it for an 'outing'; of course I agreed. She returned and openly talked how 
about how she and friends &quot;liked&quot; it. I didn't realize until I went to use it later that my 
daughter REALLY LIKED IT!! I've asked her twice to return it.

Lately I was told she'd like to consider the unit an advanced birthday present (and I 
can order another one for me). Kids :)

During my California visit I stopped in to the REI place and purchased both sizes of 
the &quot;BakePacker&quot;. I've been out twice where I could get some use and I'm impressd 
with it. Even managed to use it on the grill on the patio.

Thanks Martha for sharing the info. Works Great!!
