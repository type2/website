Hello -
my '76 camper was like this Riviera, it had the straight lifting top, 
sink and fridge on the side, I too liked it better than the available 
Westi's.  We didn't have the furnace though.  It was a &quot;forever car&quot; 
at least until I rolled it (aarrghh!!)

&gt;   What it is is a 1977 Riviera Campwagen.  I've never heard
&gt; of it before, but I think I like it better than a Westfalia.  The 3/4
&gt; length roof raises straight up instead of tilting giving at least 6'5&quot; of
&gt; head room (I'm 6-2).  Has Norcold 12/125v reefer, Coleman 2 burner range
&gt; and FORCED AIR FURNACE!!&quot;
