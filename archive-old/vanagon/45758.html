 We went on a little trip this weekend to Lanesborough, Minnesota, and foudn
that
 our fridge never really got as cold as we expected it to. Is this owing to
the 
 increadibly hot weather we had on Friday and Saturday? That is, is it only
able 
 to get temps 30-40 degrees below ambient temp? Our beer stayed _pretty_
cool, 
 but not as cold as the home fridge would have kept it, and we never got ice
to 
 form in the cute little ice tray--should this have happened, despite 90-95
temps
 during the day?
  &gt;&gt;
30 to 40 degrees below ambient is about the limit.  Consider this when
parking the Van in the sun with the windows closed.  Beer and soda should be
kept in ice chest.  I use fridge for cold cuts, fruits, veggies etc.  Pre
cool everything before putting it in there.
