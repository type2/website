&gt; I was wondering how many other listmembers will be at Busses by the Arch
&gt; this weekend?  I know Sami will be there, and I plan on attending at least
&gt; for Saturday.  I'll of course be driving the blue '73 Safare with the
&gt; snazzy list sticker in the rear window.  Would be nice to meet up with
&gt; other listmembers there...

We'll be there in our (almost) road worthy medium brown 84 Vanagon GL with 
Kansas plates and a cast iron black cat epoxied to the class III travel 
hitch!  8-)    Caveat:  Provided it survives its maiden voyage.  

We'll be with another family from Leavenworth, Kansas who'll be in a blue 
and white 78 with New Mexico plates (long story).  Another friend may be in 
our in small caravan from KC in a somewhat rusty biege 61 Single Cab with 
Missouri plates, but he fears the rain as his floor looks like Swiss cheese!
Wish us luck on I-70 through Missouri!  We should get there around 7 or 8 
Friday night, but I'm not sure how long we'll stay through the weekend.
