I tried a brief cleaning and it didn't come very clean and then I forced hot
water through the return and output lines and flakes of rust kept coming and
coming.  Since this is an area in the tank that I can't see much less get to,
I decided I was better off using the '84 gas tank.  

So, I drained the gas out of it and started cleaning the surface of it off.  I
scraped and brushed and found that the top is REALLY rusty.  A LOT rustier
than it looked at first glance. :-(   So now I have the dreaded rusted top of
the gas tank problem.  I'll scrape it and prime it and paint it and hopefully
that will slow it down.  It really looks like moisture gets underneath
whatever they use to paint the gas tank and rusts out.
