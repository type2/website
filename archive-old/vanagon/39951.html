&gt;Took the boys on a spur of the moment first camping trip this weekend. It
&gt;does beat laying around on the ground!
&gt;
&gt;All worked fine including the frige but a curious thing happened in the
&gt;morning after about 12 hours of operation on propane. It developed a periodic
&gt;&quot;drumming&quot; sound that lasted for a few seconds every several minutes or so.
&gt;It reminded me of a bildge pump. We were near packing up to leave anyway so I
&gt;didn't spend any investigative time with it.
Mine cycles on and off like that (although after this winter it doesn't 
seem to want to light).
I think it's normal.
