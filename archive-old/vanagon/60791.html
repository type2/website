Subject: Cellular Phones, temporary!

Last year, in preparation for Vanagon Westi trip that didn't take 
place, I inquired about renting a cellular phone, as my bus wasn't 
trustworthy at the time.

Bottom line on my inquiry.  Some of the cellular phone companies will 
loan you the phone, AT NO CHARGE, other that for paying for the 
actual calls made.

Sucha deal.  There is SO much competition for cellular, that they'll 
do almost anything to bait the hook.  If you can avoid the hook 
getting set, free emergency communication to call Good Sam, AAA, 
LiMBO, etc!

So, for those with planned travels, and no cell phone, check into it.

Vancouver to Seattle, SoCal to Florida, camping, long trip, towing, 
etc.
