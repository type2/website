well, in a couple of the little books about custom buses and so forth,
there are a few examples of stretched buses with double rear axles. one of
them even has two engines. and a wood-burning stove for heat ... big stove.
(how you like them apples, Martha?). :)

my thought was to meld two buses into a greyhound look-alike, with the
tag axle, and to add some sheet metal up top for that Scenicruiser look,
then to have an emblem painted up which would be a tortoise/turtle in a
galloping pose (like the rabbit emblem used to be). :)
