&gt; P.P.S.  Any suggestions as to how to protect semaphores from theft? Locking

&gt; Assuming I ever FIND replacements. . .

Sorry to hear about that.  I have a similar fear that someone will snake
my original glass taillights ($300+) or center brakelight (???) bumpers
(including a hard to find rear) ($500+) and on and on.  Mirrors.  Emblem.

Someone snaked my other taillights off the bus before I put the bubbles on.
Went out one night and the lenses and bezels were gone, but the reflector and
rubber was still there!

I put allen bolts on everything I could.  Someone tried to swipe a mirror,
and the allen bolt foiled them.  I will likely do the same for the
semaphores.  Is all that holds them on the screw at the bottom?  My bus
is s'posed to have them, and I have to find a set.   All I see is a screwhole
at the bottom.

As fas as who, it's really likely its someone who is local who knows
bugs.  Most people I've talked to don't know what they are!
