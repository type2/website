To All:

When your indicator lights go out and it comes time to do the dreadful deed,
consider doing away with the lights entirely by replacing them with
high-intensity LEDs.  

While there are some fiddlee-bits involved in converting an incandescent lamp
to LED, the basic idea is to crush the bulb, clean the cement from the brass
base, desolder the center connector, and rebuild the thing incorporating an
LED and current-limiting resistor.  For anyone experienced with surface-mount
electronic components slightly smaller than a gnat's ass, the task is
trivial.

The result is a colored lamp (Red, Yellow, or Green only) that will last for
as long as your great-grandchild owns the vehicle.
