RE:	Copy of: purchasing a used vanagon

&gt;We're sitting here trying to figure out which is the best year/model
&gt;Vanagon to buy.  It will be used primarily as a workhorse for an
&gt;independent construction person who totes around a lot of materials,
&gt;tools, and a big Rottweiler.
&gt;
&gt;We're in a pretty good market selection-wise (Northern CA) so once the
&gt;right range is identified we should be able to find one.  Specifically,
&gt;we're curious to know if any models were made for the US with full
&gt;paneled sides (no windows) for commerical use.  I know we've seen them
&gt;in Europe.  Also, can the top handle a roof rack for lumber?  
&gt;
&gt;Any wisdom/tips would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!

Hi, Liz  This is probably the only time anyone will ever hear me say this,
but......
Buy a full size American pickup truck or van. Vanagons make good people haulers,
and are ok for some real light loads, but they aren't work trucks. If you buy a
late '70's or early '80's American Full size pickup truck or van, then you may
be able to get one that doesn't have all the electronics on them as the newer
ones, and I know Ford did offer a full size pickup truck with a 6 cyl, if you
are concerned about the gas mileage.  I just towed a Vanagon all the way across
Ohio, a feat I did with a '80 318 V8 Dodge van, as American trucks are built
more for that.   It would be cheaper in the long run for you  to just buy
American, than be blowing head gaskets every 20k.mi from overheating due to
large loads in your vanagon.  Also vanagon panel vans were never imported into
the US for sale by VWoA.

don't flame me, I'm just being REALISTIC.
