Subject: Why would someone do this?

Well, someone tried to break into my `66 while I was at work the other day-
jammed a bunch of stuff in the passenger door lock. I have a couple of 
questions:

1) Are audiovox 8-TRACKS worth that much?

2) My bus is _REALLY_ ugly (She smells a bit, but has a heart of gold?):
   Why would some nefarious soul want to steal her?

3) Why didn't all my anti-theft devices work? (8-track, ugliness, Pinto
   taillights, dents, general raggity Ann-ness?)

4) What am I supposed to do when my project becomes my daily driver? I've
driven Frau Streudel over 1,500 miles in the last month! i take her to the
store, to work, to my folk's home (70 miles away), I guess the 100+ hours
I spent on the drivetrain/front paid off! (I would stop driving her, but
she's the best damn car I have in my fleet!) (Better than my `62(`61) bug!)
