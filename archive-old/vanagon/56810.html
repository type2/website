List Members;

Does anyone know of a good Watercooled VW shop or mech in the Santa
Monica.Ca, area?
have a friend with a one owner 90 Westfalia,with25K actual miles on it,
took it into Santa Monica VW for a pre Florida trip inspection,and they
are telling her her heads are leaking, her water pump is leaking and
they need approx 1600.00 to replace one head gasket and replace the
water pump.Stated they called VOA for good will assistance since vehicle
had only 25 k miles on it and was obviously not abused,,I tried to talk
to the service mgr to no avail,he stated she's not entitled to any
assistances from VW,Goodwill or otherwise as the veh has been out of
warranty since 11/96.prior to her leaving Santa Rosa with the van ,It
had been completely tuned up ,serviced, water pressure leak tested with
no leaks whatsoever,and here two weeks later ,some mismanaged shop is
trying to rip this poor girl for 15-1600.00,she is beside herself, I
told her to get the van up to me and I would repair it for about 600.00
if it was at all necessary,which I don't believe it is.   Any assistance
would be greatly appreciated, 

Thanks in advance, Roy ,roy_at_juno_dot_com,roy_at_ap_dot_net,roy1937_at_aol_dot_com
