Subject: Re: cv-joints


While we're on the subject of c.v. joints, I have a problem with my '73
that nobody I've spoken to has experienced. There is a low frequency
shake from the transmission. It's intermittent, sometimes really bad other
times hardly noticable but dissappearing on the over-run or when not in 
gear. It feels like the engine and gearbox are wobbling back and forth on 
their mounts but these look in good condition. A parts shop suggested
it was a seized c.v. joint. This sounded plausible, especially since the
guy diagnosed this without hesitation like it was something he came across
every day. So I took them all out (not without resorting to a hacksaw and
an air chisel, a story that will make me a martyr amongst experienced
c.v. joint-ers :-)) and stripped and regreased them. One looked a little 
worn but hadn't been making noises or anything. The shake seemed to have
reduced, although it could have been wishful thinking, and I thought I 
had found what the problem was. That was a couple of weeks ago and its
now as bad as ever. So, before I shell out for a new joint, what is the
verdict of the net-jury? Is the c.v. joint guilty or not guilty? (The 
sentence is death by hurling it at the garage wall)
