Subject: VW Show N Calif July 6, any info?
Date: 18 Jun 97 09:52:08 PDT

There is the Gold Country VW Car Show and Swap Meet
coming up on July 6th at the El Dorado County Fairgrounds in 
Placerville (about 50 miles east of Sacramento on Hiway 50).

This is their second year.  Anybody on the lists go to it last year? 
If so, any comments?   I haven't been to ANY VW shows so I have 
nothing to compare it with.

I talked briefly to someone associated with it.  WCM and RMMW are 
planning on being there.  They had a bigger turnout than expected 
last year, so expect more this year.

We're planning on going, we'll be nearby over the Independence Day 
weekend and will take my SO and daughter, sons will be out of town. 
Anybody else planning on attending?  We'll be in our Westi camping 
about a half hour away.
