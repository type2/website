Hey Martha, I have one of those Snorkel stoves! You know its not such a
crazy idea, just lugging the staves and hoops for the tub would be a chore!

What I have done, and works very well, is construct a teepee from found
poles and the ubiqitous plastic tarp. You then heat up some carefully
chosen rocks in the campfire and transport them (the &quot;fun&quot; part) to the
teepee, then pour water over the rock... instant sauna. I have placed
Achillea millefolium (whats the common name again?) under and over the
rocks for a nice herbal smell, in the desert, using sagebrush would be great.

Its wonderful to have a sauna after a day of wading/swimming in a cold river.
