Subject: Re: Personality Problems (f)

what does it say about you if you have those little pompom's hanging from
the top of the inside of the windshield? I just got finished installing all
that deep pile shag carpet in the van. Now the only thing i have to do to
finish it off is find a crystal decanter set for between the seats, and a
chain link steering wheel;-)




&gt;Does this mean that the more knobs, plug in devices, light fixtures
&gt;monitors, gauges, trim we have on our busses the more control oriented we
&gt;are? Personally, I prefer to keep the interior stock while adding only
&gt;those items that will help me know how the engine is performing;does this
&gt;mean that I seek an underlying order to all things cosmic, and am
&gt;inherently conservative; and what about the guy who puts in things like
&gt;fuel consumption monitors, 80 watt speakers, chrome trim etc; or the
&gt;person who redecorates the interior in flannel :) ?
