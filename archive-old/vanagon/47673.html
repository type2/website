Subject: 1988 westy oil problem and solution?

Hello everyone, i want to Thank publically all who offered my friend and I
very helpful information reguarding vanagons.  My friend is racking his
brain, in preparation for his trip and is thinking about getting a VW
remanufactured engine.

He is wondering who in the DC area has had a 2.1L rebuilt engine installed
and where they had it done, what were the prices, and was the work well done.

thanks again, and drive safely.
