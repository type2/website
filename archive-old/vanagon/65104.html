The slip in the word article is more my unskilled typing than some strange
doctors dreams.  The world is not on the computer and alot of those do not
have their own we page to show each of us the personal changes done to
their rigs.  I have seen many ideas for my vanagon from Hot VWs and even
Trucking.  Hot VW's did have a tech letter that had many real ideas about
which High Perf. parts that could be switched from the type 1 to the water
boxer.  I have also seen the High Perf. water boxer engines used
in a type III (my mechanics work of art) and in a off road racer.  Both of
these are much more custom than what I want my camper to be they do give me
ideas to go on.

I have also seen alot about what people keep writing about in the vanagon
list.  Like source for 14 &amp; 15 &amp; 16 inch custom rims for the vanagon.  Or
how about the high performance headers and the turbo kit that some one was
looking for their stock diesel.
Its all there right now.  If people are closed minded about this so much
they should be driving M.B. or Volvo's, both Hot V.W. &amp; VW treads are
sources of ideas, not laws on HOW volkswagons are to be built. Please
forgive me if I flamed but the Holier
than thou attitude gets to me alot.
