 What makes you think that they're reinforced?  40 psi usually means non
reinforced.  Maybe they are but that is a curious max psi.

&gt;Micheling MX 185/70 R 14's.  These are reinforced sidewall tires and will
&gt;carry 1540lbs per tire at 40 psi max pressure.  The problem is that the door
&gt;sticker says 50psi in the back.
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone have any experience with MX's??
