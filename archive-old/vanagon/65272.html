&gt;Ok. The count to ten trick works. I push in the clutch and count to ten,
then
&gt;shift into reverse. No grind.
&gt;
&gt;So Thanks. And I have a follow -up question.
&gt;
&gt;Does that mean my problem is solved? Or am I simply avoiding a symptom
of
&gt;something that will have to be addressed sooner or later?

If I recall this started after a tranny rebuild correct? When I had to
replace third gear in mine I remember there was a shim under the reverse
idle gear. The size of which required some math to calculate. If the
clearance is a bit on the tight side the gear will spin a bit longer
after pushing in the clutch. Since reverse is not synchronized it will
not match speeds with the main shaft and grind. Counting to ten gives it
time to stop spinning. In my case I do not think it is any thing to worry
about.  Two years later I only count to four. If you are still worried
run this past the fellow who rebuilt it.
&gt;
&gt;I might add I got several suggestions from list members to solve the
problem.
&gt;They ranged from adjusting the clutch to bleeding the clutch. And then
&gt;suggestions that the clutch might be oil soaked and grabbing. or the
pilot
&gt;bearing might be going, and therefore grabbing the input shaft.&gt;
&gt;As near as I can tell the hydraulic clutch is not adjustable. Bleeding
the
&gt;system seems like a good idea. In fact Bentleys says to flush or maybe
it's
&gt;bleed the system every year or two. ( I don't have the Bentley in front
of me
&gt;because I park my Vanagon and Bentley about 50 miles away _at_ my parents
&gt;home.)
&gt;
These are all good suggestions, though I agree, I know of no way to
adjust a hydraulic clutch. I was under the impression that they were self
adjusting. I think flushing the system is a must every two years or
better if you live in a humid environment. Since it does not grind after
C.2.10(counting to ten)I doubt if anything is broken.

&gt;Anyway if you suffered this grind and know of a long -term solution I'd
&gt;appreciate any more advice you might have. Or if you think the idea is
just
&gt;to wait after disengaging the clutch because that give the trans time to
&gt;stop spinning-- and therefore I'm going on needlessly, also please let
me
&gt;know.
&gt;
&gt;I really appreciate your solution. Thanks
