SOME marketers still have not a clue -

&gt; &gt;As you know, offer follows demand and in this case it has been found
                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There was no demand for the Beetle until it existed!
There was no demand for the BUS until it existed!
There was no demand for the Subaru Sidekick . . . .
There was no demand for the Miata  . . . . . 
Mazda is laughing all the way to the bank.
There still shouldn't be a demand for the Hummer, but . . .

Still want to know why there are no 4 door mini trucks in the US, I 
KNOW there is a demand for low cost multi-people vehicles,
HEY that soulds like a BUS.  Until the marketing folks figure out how to 
ask questions like&quot; what would you like&quot; instead of which do you 
like&quot; we'll be stuck with (fill in the blank)
