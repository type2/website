Subject: OXY SENSOR LIT


 &gt; From: Jack Agnew

V&gt; I had the same problem and it turns out that the light indicates nothing 
 &gt; but the elapsed miles since it was reset last - a pesky reminder to take 
 &gt; it to your local mechanic for service (and a check of the oxy 
 &gt; thing-a-ma-jig). It can be reset. Good luck
 &gt; -Jack

I'm worried. I just got my engine rebuilt and when I got the brick back
the oxy light was on. I asked the mechanics to fix/reset it, and they told
me that it was a complicated task, required taking the dash board out
and that it was better served at a dealer with a &quot;special tool&quot;.

Joel has kindly given me a simple procedure to reset the light sans
complicated process.

Now I'm worried about the competency of the mechanic and my rebuild.
