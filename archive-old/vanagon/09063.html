Subject: Bus Art: paint ideas and designs?



Hi all,

Well, looks like I'm going to paint Prospector, my '72 Safari Custom Camper
topped bus sometime in the next 5 months.  A couple years ago I took a course
at the local community college on auto body and fixed all the dents,
straightened the bumpers, patched holes in the fiberglass, etc., etc.
and now I'm taking &quot;Auto Painting I&quot; at the same college and expect to get
a coat of paint on (and just in time, some of the primer is showing a
little rust).

So, I am wondering how to paint this thing.  The original color is the light
orange they had in those years although the rear door is off a '73 and is 
the darker orange from that year.  The top is currently green with white on
top (the green was spray paint, yuck).  Ideas I have kicked around the last
couple of years are:

1. Repaint the same original orange color with top-most section painted white.
2. Camouflage paint using flat desert colors (tan, various light orange, etc.)
3. Flowers, peace signs, etc. very retro-60s (still mostly orange)
4. White all over
5. White top, red stripe, bottom blue with big white stars....

And so, I'm lookin' for other ideas.  Anybody painted their bus anything but
stock color?  Any interesting design suggestions?  (This bus is far from stock
with no chance of returning to stock so I'm not worried about keeping it
the original color.  I also hope to get a chance to paint the '66 and that one
I'll keep stock, Titian Red bottom, Beige Grey top.  And the paint on the '73
is still good (Orange).)

Cheers,

 -Dyer
