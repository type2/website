Subject: '81 Westy

Hey all,
	I have some questions about an '81 Westy (or any early
	air-cooled Vanagon for that matter).  I'm looking possibly at an
	'81 Westy which looks really nice rather than a breadloaf.  I
	wonder how many of you guys can tell me advantages/disadvantages
	to owning a Vanagon as compared to a late model breadloaf bus.
	Things like power, engine access, reliability and all that.
	Also, this Vanagon is a Westy with stove and refrig. and all
	that.  the owner says that the fridge works on 110v power but it
	doesn't work on propane power.  He says it's probably the
	ignitor.  How big a job is it to fix something like that?  Are
	the parts expensive?  Speaking of which, how reliable do the
	camping parts of Westys tend to be?  Do they break a lot or do
	they generally hold up well?  I'm asking about Vanagon Westys
	but also breadloaf Westys.  

	Taxing the collective knowledge of the group again,
	Sean
