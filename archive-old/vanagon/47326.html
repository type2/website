Subject: CBC Radio Interview...

Hi Everyone.  I taped Christa Ovenell's  interview with the CBC Radio 
that aired yesterday morning.  This is the interview about all the VW 
vans going to Inuvik this summer.  It was a pretty good plug for 
travelling in VW's, and the &quot;community&quot; one belongs to while owning 
these vehicles.  It is about 15 minutes long.

Now, I have no means to digitize this thing.  I was wondering if 
someone out there has that capability, and if so, would like to 
digitize and maybe Gerry can make it available in the Archives.  I'm 
not even sure how big an audio file of 15 minutes would even be.  Are 
there any &quot;digital&quot; experts out there on the list that can offer a 
brief feasability of this?  Could someone who subscribes to the type2 
list pass this note onto them as well??  

I guess if people wanted their own &quot;taped&quot; version, they could send 
me a tape, etc.  Ideas anyone?

Thanks,
Harry.
