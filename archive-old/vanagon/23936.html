Subject: RE: VW Vandals/roadside beating

A local bus lover and his wife were driving down the road late one night
last week. Three pick up trucks full of drunken young rowdy buttheads
wearing *&quot;cowboy attire&quot; surrounded the bus and forced it to the side of the
road. They misidentified the bus driver for someone that the &quot;cowboy
attired&quot; persons had an altercation with at their local watering hole. These
folks yanked the driver out of the bus, beat the daylights out of him
Reginald Denny style and took pool cues and ball bats to the bus. While
forcing the bus off of the road, the bus drove over two of those parking lot
dividers. Now the bus tracks sideways down the road.

*&quot;cowboy attire&quot; = clothing worn by cowboys and other people.
                   Not all cowboys are drunken, malicious a**holes.
