&gt;Hi
&gt;I have a question.  I am planning on driving west this fall in my Diesel 
&gt;Westy.  I read in the back of Bentley that some states require a permit 
&gt;in order to purchase diesel fuel.  Does anyone now which states, if any, 
&gt;require a permit?  If so, how does one go about acquiring one? I 
&gt;appreciate any leads...

        This mostly applies to trucks (18-22 wheelers) Most places that have
diesel also have auto-diesel, there is no difference in the two except that
the tax is charged at the pump (the same as with gasoline).  
        The result of this is that the price on the big sign out front of
the station and the price you are charged may be different.
        Do not pull up to the truck fuel islands without being instructed to
do so.  Truck diesel and and auto diesel have thier taxes calculated
differently and the station can get in BIG trouble if you fill up at a truck
pump and they will not hesitate to yell at you if you try.
        Do note that my experience applies only to those areas west of the
Rocky Mts.  There IS NOTHING east of the Rockys.  (except a couple of ARMY
bases I had the honor of touring, and i'm no longer sure that they were
there either)
