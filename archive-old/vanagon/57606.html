Subject: 76' westies for sale
Date: Tue, 25 Mar 1997 13:39:55 -0500 (EST)

I have a friend who has two 76 westies for sale.  Both are very
solid mechanically, but one could use some paint.  I have
driven both of them and they are nice.  the one with the paint
problem has a new engine (rebuilt??? i don't know.)  I just put
a new fuel line on the other one, so i was a little more
intimate with it.  They are located in charlottesville,VA.

If you are interested please e-mail me off the list.
