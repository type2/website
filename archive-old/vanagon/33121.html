Subject: Re: My bus hates me...8(

Pat et al, I have the same problem with the 009 I have as well as a vacuum
advance dist. currently installed in the bus. That's one of the keys that
makes me wonder if I should be looking elsewhere. Sorry for leaving that
out...and thanks for the nice explanation. It helps. 8) Joe

&gt; I've heard that part of the problem is with the way the 009 handles advance.
&gt; I've heard there are two weights and springs, and that one weight moves out
&gt; due to centrifugal force, then at some point makes contact with the second
&gt; weight, then they both move out together.  The result is an advance &quot;curve&quot;
&gt; that looks something like the following:
&gt; 
&gt;                                            /
&gt;                                          /
&gt;                                        /
&gt;                                      /
&gt;                              -------
&gt;                             /
&gt;                           /
&gt;                         /
&gt;                       /
&gt; 
&gt; You would expect the advance to be linear according to RPM, but this deal
&gt; with the two weights makes it advance kind of in stages.  This may not be
&gt; accurate, but I read it in this group awhile back.  My bus behaves kind of
&gt; as you described.  I rev it to about 3K and let the clutch out fairly
&gt; normally and it doesn't do too bad.  I've heard the Weber progressive works
&gt; better with the 009, and will probably install one next summer.  If your
&gt; compression is okay and valves are adjusted and points and plugs are okay,
&gt; you pretty much have to assume the problem is with the carb or dist.  You
&gt; might try a different 009 (or carb), but that's about all I can suggest.
