     A danger with some of the (earlier?) Bosch F.I. systems is that by 
     opening the throttle body (depressing the accelerator pedal), you 
     expose the &quot;vane&quot; in the &quot;air flow box&quot; to damage from backfires.  A 
     backfire can blow the vane right off its pivots which usually requires 
     a replacement.
     
     Is this still a concern with the Digi-series of F.I. systems?
