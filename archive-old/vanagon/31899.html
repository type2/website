Not so /f in my opinion.  Very serious.

&gt;those of you contemplating buying a rusty van for use or restoration 
&gt;really should take a trip out of the rust-belt.  i didn't realize the 
&gt;number of fine vans left without &quot;Fred Flintstone&quot; floors.  there are 
&gt;many many daily-drivers running around that haven't been restored or 
&gt;lavishised with doting care that are completely rust-free.  it is 
&gt;amazing.  busses and bugs.  they're everywhere.

The only question is, how can I *afford* to go bus-hunting outside the
rust belt?  Let's say I do get out to SoCal somehow and see lots of
great busses.  How do I convince someone to sell me one?  How can I
afford 2 weeks in a hotel, and 2 weeks off work?  Someone want to put
me up in their house (no joke, very serious)?

This was one of my very first postings to this list, and now I repeat
it: If you live in one part of the USA, what is an effective way to do
car shopping in another part?  For instance, is there one or maybe two
weekly sale papers in SoCal that most everyone recognizes as the &quot;most
comprehensive&quot; list of cars for sale in the state?  Can I buy a
subscription?  We have them here--the &quot;Want Ad Press&quot; in NJ and the
&quot;Want Ad Weekly Classifieds&quot; in DC are two I know of, although I've
never tried subscribing.

Yes, I know about the &quot;Classifieds 2000&quot; webpage.  But I'm sure it
doesn't traffic nearly the volume of ads that one of the more (gasp)
mainstream classifieds papers would handle.  What's out there, Volks?

&gt;but i will gladly remain tucked away in the northwoods 
&gt;where, on a winters evening with the moonlight on the snow, one can 
&gt;drive for over an hour with the headlights off-- eyes completely 
&gt;adjusted to the dark, and never meet another car.

Been there, done that.  Growing up in the mountains of West Virginia.
It's a beautiful thing!
