Subject: Wanted: Eurovan (Portland, OR)

 &gt; I am looking for a 93 Eurovan, light metallic blue, low miles, with
     &gt;convenievce package in the Portland, OR area or within 300mi.  Only
    &gt; MV's without weekender (pop top) package.

As of last weekend Campbell/Nelson VW had several &quot;brand new&quot; ie. less than
20 miles on the odometer, plastic wrap on the carpeting, etc. 93 Eurovans.
At least one of them was an MV (it was maroon though). They also have a
fairly good selection of used Eurovans.

They can be reached at (206) 524-6660. The asking prices were between
$18,000 and $21,000 if I remember correctly.

They seem to be a pretty good dealership (as far as dealerships go) and
have a history of carrying far more vans in their lot than any other VW
dealer in the Seattle area.

Hope this helps.

Jeff
