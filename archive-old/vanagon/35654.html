&gt; Gadzooks!  A gas, I mean diesel, heater?  Can it be?  I guess the heater
&gt; core wasn't invented until 1984?  Does anyone have any advice about care and
&gt; feeding?  The PO told me the heater worked but that the heater fan was
&gt; toast.  Real shocker, I know.

A gas(diesel) heater was and option. You still have the &quot;regular&quot; heater 
rad up in the dash. The aux heater works like the rest, combusting diesel 
and blowing hot air into the cabin. You should see that funny 
green(illuminated) knob on the lower half of the dash. The air 
distribution &quot;box&quot; under the dash is slightly different in vans with the 
aux heater - suggest buying the Bentley, it details the electrics and 
mechanicals. the &quot;skid plate&quot; under the center portion of the van 
protects the aux heater.

&gt; 
&gt; Anyway.  A place downtown is overhauling my starter 5 year warranty, $99
&gt; bucks using my starter.  We'll see.
&gt; 
Seems like a good deal, new starter is around $230Can, if you can find one.

&gt; While gazing a little more at the wonderous curve balls they threw me on
&gt; this one (my  sixth VW) I noticed the rear swing arm.  Does the CV joint
&gt; actually pass THROUGH this unit on all vanagons?  What a hoot.  How the hell
&gt; am I supposed to inspect CV boots without X-ray vision?

Yes it is a pain, especiallly if the van is NOT on a lift. I found that a 
good trouble light and an extension for the socket plus jacking one side 
up just enough to allow the tire to turn and wedging my body against the 
tire when wrenching the bolt, then let the tire turn 30 degrees to do the 
next was one solution. When the van is up on a lift and you use an air 
powered socket then it is trivial, the wheel doesn't spin (due to the 
nature of air tools) and it takes about 2 minutes to remove the outbouard cv.
