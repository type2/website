&gt; Subject: pre' 68 westy pop top canvas??

&gt; Anybody have any good recommendations on what company sells
&gt;  the best canvas to replace on my (straight up) pop top on
&gt;  my 65' westy???

I am not going to try to actually *push* JCW, but I got a
copy of their VW-only catalog in the mail this morning.
They list, for point of comparison, a
&quot;duplicate-of-original&quot; canvas for pop-tops (1964-1967) at
$159.95 US.  Of their product they say:

&quot;Original tan color. Mesh screens, where original.  Include
storm flaps (with zipper or hook/loop closure) to assure
total privacy.&quot;

I don't have the catalog here at my office, but doesn't Bus
Boys carry this too?

&gt; Also how about the rubber seal at the base of the pop top??
&gt;  IS WCM's pretty good??

It has been a few years since I bought anything from WCM.
&gt;From what I recall, their quality was pretty good.
