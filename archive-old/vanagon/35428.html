Subject: Help finding an engine

I am in need of an engine as faithful readers are already aware.  I would
like to get one that matches the year of my bus (1969).  Does anyone have
any suggestions?  For junkyard/dismantler suggestions I am in Northern
California in Stockton which is 1 hour south of Sacramento.

Thanks

-Marlin
