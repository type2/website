Subject: Westy ('84) propane leaks!!!


Help..  I just had the propane tank filled and after checking for leaks woth
soapy water I found that gas was leaking from the center of the pressure
regulator, out a tiny square hole in the face of it. Er.. is this 'normal'
operation? It would normally be under the plastic cover.
         It says on the regulator 'for outdoor use', and the leak is sooo
small that it blows bubbles slowly. But! has anyone else ever noticed this,
or smelled a tiny whiff of propane near the regulator. It happens when the
valve is opened, and for a while after I close it, until pressure in the
lines up to the stove drops off. The system hasn't had propane in it for XX
years I believe, if ever. TIA  tim smith
