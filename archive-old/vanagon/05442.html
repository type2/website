&gt; Now.  Another important question.  Should I buy a 65 Camp-
&gt; mobile in fairly good shape for $500?  The interior stuff
&gt; has all been removed so the guy could haul motorcycles with
&gt; it (!) but it's been stored in his basement.  Body's not
&gt; bad (rockers rusty, but all else OK).  Starter turns real
&gt; slowly, 'tho the battery's up.  Runs well, steers fair.

I'd buy it if it was near me.  I've never seen a bus that old that
cheap that wasn't thrashed beyond belief.

&gt; Should I or shouldn't I?  Aren't 2 Busses enough?  Am
&gt; I crossing some line?  

Naaaahhh... more busses = more better!
