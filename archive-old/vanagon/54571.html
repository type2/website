Subject: Re: Mystery dash outlet '83.5 GL Westy

Thanks!  I'll have to try and score a couple of those Hella plugs.  
Actually, now that I know what it is, it seems like a more solid piece of 
hardware than the cigarette lighter (like the plug would fit better, less 
wiggling and more contact).  Do you offhand know of an 800 number or an 
address with which to contact Hella?  Besides this plug I'm interested in 
some fog lights (we get alot of fog here in Santa Cruz off Monterey Bay, 
I can't tell you how many times deer have attempted to decorate the Westy 
with their bodies while I'm driving at night down from my work up here at 
the U).

Thanks again--Charles

&gt; &gt;Ok, there's what looks like an extra electrical socket about halfway 
&gt; &gt;between the cig lighter and the glove box.  Its maybe slightly larger 
&gt; &gt;than the headphone plug on a stereo amp.  I can't see behind it to look 
&gt; &gt;for wires. 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Doe's anyone know what it is?  If it is a plug,  what kinds of 
&gt; &gt;accessories fit it?  I'm pretty sure it isn't a pencil sharpener.

&gt; Yes, that's the name of that outlet - the &quot;mystery outlet&quot; but the only real
&gt; mystery is why VW put these European style outlets in the dashes of the US
&gt; import Westy's, and basically included practically no accessories to fit it. 
&gt; These outlets were standard in all '74-'84 Westfalias. I have only ever seen 2
&gt; accessories that fit in here. on the '74 &amp; '75 westy's there was a small air
&gt; compressor to inflate that &quot;spacesaver spare&quot; tire (you actually had to inflate
&gt; the tire before you could use it - kind of the &quot;Edsel&quot; of spacesaver spare
&gt; tires......) needless to say this early version of the &quot;inflate before you use
&gt; it&quot; spare only lasted 2 yrs, then they went back to a full size
&gt; spare......uh....wonder why???...  Anyway, the '74-'75 westy air compressor pump
&gt; plug fit in here, and I have seen a small cigarette lighter fit in here. This is
&gt; a HELLA only item. The HELLA plugs are still available, and they are $12 each.
&gt; You can wire the HELLA plug into any 12v accessory that you would be able to run
&gt; off a conventional cigarette lighter .  
&gt; 
&gt; thanks for reminding me - I need to order a couple too.
