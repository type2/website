Subject: ADVICE/Info Needed!

    I am wondering what my options are as to replacing the original engine
 in a ('50-'79) bus with a water-cooled engine so I can have some *real*
 heat...what specific engines will work? And how must the heating system be
 modified? Any information on this type of modification would be greatly
 appreciated! 
    
     Also- I have never seen a VW camper before. Could someone tell me
 about what the layout of stuff inside a camper is like? And any other
 differences between a camper and a regular &quot;bus&quot;?
 
    Oh- and please e-mail me at FASO101_at_ACAD3.ALASKA.EDU if possible. Thanks! :)
