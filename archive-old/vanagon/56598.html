&gt;| Check your Idle Stabilizer unit, located in front of the right taillight.
&gt;| This unit is mounted on the inner wheelwell of the rear wheel, and if 
&gt;| you have rust on this area, you get a lot of water spashing in there.

	I thought the ECU controlled idle stablization with the digifant
system on an 88 (and therefore, there was no separate idle stablizer besides
the one directly on top of the engine block - the thing that looks like 2 D
cell batteries with two wires and two air hoses connected to it, though I
do remember seeing a black VDO box behind the right tailight for which I
could not figure out a pupose, is this infact an idle stablizer control unit?
I cannot remember the bentley diagrams well enough at the moment).
	If the idle stablizer unit is indeed what we are talking about, it
would be hard to install this upside down as the second air hose goes directly
down to the air distribution manifold, on my engine at least. Is the above for
an 86-91 with the digifant system or pre 86 with the digijet (which I remember
had a separate idle stabilzer control unit mounted on the firewall with two
plugs in the bottom that one was suppose to disconnect from the control unit
and connect to each other when adjusting the idle to cut the idle stablizer
out of the system)? Again, my memory on the diagrams proves to be a bit 
fuzzy so check this info before using anything I have said here...
	I remember seeing quite a few posts concerning cleaning out the
idle stabilzer for the digifant system (which very well may be the same
piece on the digijet system, just controlled differently, I dunno). One about
gunk collecting on the back side of a valve and made the valve stick open
sticks in my head as something to check... Anyway, a search on the archives
should provide a wealth of information on this...
