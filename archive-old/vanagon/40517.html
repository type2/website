 Hi Volks,

 I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of you who have
responded and are still helping about my inquiries/pleas for help on the
title and past subjects. This list is great. Not only one gets expert
technical advise but also advise which is not found in any book, this one in
the consumer side. As I acquire the knowledge, I try and pass it on to others.

 Again, thanks a million.
