Brian.

I use a NAPA muffler. Lifetime guarantee. about $120.00, but it is the last
one you will pay for. Fits just fine. Go to your mechanic (or NAPA store)
and order one for a diesel vanagon. They also have the tailpipe that makes
the warm soot go out backwards.

&gt;Has anyone replaced their diesel vanagon muffler with any other than stock 
&gt;muffler????
&gt;
&gt;My muffler is shot...The local muffler shop that has done custom work for me 
&gt;thinks he can put a 6&quot; round 20&quot; long muffler under the van with no porblems?

&gt;					Thanks again  Brian 82 dsl.
