&gt; 
&gt; Well Rick welcome to the starter club!
&gt; 
&gt; I had the exact problem with my 85.  One way to get it started is to go   
&gt; under the van, hit the starter with a hammer while someone has the   
&gt; ignition turned.  What happens is that the starter motor turns but the   
&gt; binhex doesn't spin out to engage with the flywheel.  If you go under the   
&gt; passenger-rear side of the van, you can hear a spinning sound when the   
&gt; key is turned.

Actually, that spinning sound is the fuel pump, more than likely.  When
the engine's not running, the fuel pump only turns on when the key is
turned to start.  The starter motor will not spin unless the solenoid
engages it to the flywheel because the contact for power to the starter
motor is at the end of the solenoid's travel.
