Hello!

I am glad I found your list!!! It has been my dream to own an aircooled 
VW van for quite a while now. I have had nothing but odd, nightmarish 
problems with water cooled vehicles!!

Can anyone perhaps give me any advice on what to buy? I have been told 
that buying any VW bus before 74 is a safe idea. I have been told also 
that the type IV engine is troublesome.

Frankly, I am a college student who wants a bus taht will be reliable, 
yet fun to drive and dependable. Perhaps I am asking for too much? I 
dunno. Whatever anyone can offer for suggestions I would be thankful :)


Back home and glad to be!
