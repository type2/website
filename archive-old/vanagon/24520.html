Subject: Another Great Use of Naval Jelly

Hi All,

While fixing the brake lights of my 67 Bug this past weekend I decided to 
try out some advice given in an upcoming VVWCA tech article on using 
Naval Jelly to remove corrosion and increase the conductivity of wiring 
connectors.  Man, oh man did it ever work great!  The connectors had 
white corrosion and looked pretty bad until I saturated them in the pink 
stuff and let them soak for about 10 minutes before rinsing them off in 
warm water.  It's almost magical seeing the dull shine of the brass after 
it's rinsed and now my brake lights work great!!  8-)
