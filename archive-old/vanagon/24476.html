Subject: Re: To the guy in Puerto Rico (Alexis)

Oh WOW! I remember last winter when I responded in Spanish to a list member
in Mexico that was taking alot of heat (flame war) over something or
another. I got ripped by everyone even though I did it just to &quot;pull
everyone's chain.&quot; It seemed that alot of folks bit in hook line and sinker.
;) I loved it! It caused a two week battle the broke into a billiion
different threads. It was a gas. I remember what the subject was but won't
start it all again. I think it was on the Vintagvw list. The whole thing
caused us to get &quot;moderated&quot; like we were sent to detention hall or
something!!! =). So, in Esponol: Tratamos a no causar problemas! 
Keep in mind that &quot;Trouble maker/Joker&quot; is my middle (Materno) name ;)

 &gt;Angel,
&gt;	Keep on writing to us en Spanish.  Mine is rusty and it is good 
&gt;to read about a tpic I'm interested in in Spanish.  Kind of wish I could 
&gt;write English better!  Gary Gibson
