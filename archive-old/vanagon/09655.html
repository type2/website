Martha, did you, (excuse the expression) velour around the curved members
of your van? You know the bits which are bare metal in our early vanagons
but which are &quot;wallpapered&quot; in the late model GLs.

Your idea about &quot;velouring&quot; the pop-top ceiling is great. I am thinking
about making panels out of ensolite and covered with pile, to velcro onto
the ceiling crosswise in the molded depressions. I figure that it would
insulate the top and you could use the panels as &quot;cushions&quot; or an extra
sleeping pad if joined together. We find that when sleeping up top,
condensation gathers on the molded ridge and drips on the face of the one
unlucky enough to be, even slightly, downhill of the other. (I do not have
a pop-top vent :( )
