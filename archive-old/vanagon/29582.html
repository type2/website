There's no simple way. You just have to be careful to undue everything 
else, like Dieter said.

I decided to put twin Kadron's on my rebuilt engine to cure the 
overheating caused by running a warmer Berg cam. My VW man, Ross, said I 
shouldn't have to but I found it easier to pull the engine. This was 
yesterday, after I spent an hour staring at it trying to work out an 
easier way.

Anyway, I took the opportunity to install the thermostat vane thingos in the blower 
housing that I didn't do when I was putting the motor back together last 
time.

I find the worst thing is getting it back in.

1) the top right bolt through the starter keeps slipping away as you try 
and thread the nut back on. I ended up 
getting my daughter's boyfriend to lie under the bus and hold the bolt 
(he seemed a little nervous). I 
know that I could have held it by lowering the engine slightly, like St 
Muir says, but I forget and did it last. Maybe next time. 

2) the throttle cable must be pulled through before you tighten up the 
bolts. Twice I have had to loosen things to get it out where it was 
jammed between the engine and transmission. Maybe next time.

3) getting the foam seal back in around the engine, but mainly behind the 
blower housing. I've got the scratches and bruises to show for it. 

Bob Hoover recently did a thing about pulling the engine. You should have 
a look at it, plus St Muir is good.

Good luck
