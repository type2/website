Subject: Gauge placement 86 westy

------------
	I don't want to modify my dash however I feel the need to install a couple
of 2 inch gauges in my 86 westy,about the only choice seems to be just past
the radio.I plan to retain the warning lights so way over there may work
out.Any input on a good location would me appreciated.I recently bought
this 86 westy and no oil presure gauge is difficult for me,I just like to
know what is going on. 
	Does anyone have a 79ca or aircooled vanagon manual transaxil ecu that use
an ego sensor input to controll the mixture for sale.I have a spare  78 ecu
I would like to trade in on the later ecu if possible.I want to install the
later ecu in a 78 westy,I have found through much playing and testing an
ecu with an ego provides a mixture that is  very very precise.Much more
precise than tuning the ecu spring could ever accomplish.
