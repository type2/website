&gt; I just wanted to mention that I had similar symptoms and looking at my invoice, it
&gt; says that it was from a sticking idle valve.  I have investigated as what the idle
                                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

     That was suppose to say 'have not investigated' &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
		 
&gt; valve is, but it doesn't sound like the same thing as the coolant sensor Joel was
&gt; speaking of.  And yet, I had the exact same symptoms that Richard had.  Matter of
&gt; fact, I thought Richard had been drivin' my car. ;)  .  So what do a think?
