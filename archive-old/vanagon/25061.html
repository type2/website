hey all,
	i have a friend looking for a 1967 or older split bus
(something from her childhood i believe).  she hasn't had too much
luck finding one at all.  how hard do you think this will be for her.
she is an ok mechanic and doesn't mind figuring out the things she
doesn't know.  just wondering...


take care,
	brandy
