Subject:      Re: aligning distributor

Remember, on a 4-cycle engine the distributor rotates once for each TWO
rotations of the crankshaft. When aligned with the notch #1 cyl is a TDC with
valves CLOSED; with the dist. 180 deg away #1 is at TDC with valves OPEN.
Rotate the crank 1 turn and the distributor will line up like the manual says.

On reinstalling, forgot to seat it properly.  Isn't the contact
on the rotor supposed to line up with the notch on the edge of
the distributor housing, when you're around top-dead center?
Mine is now 180 degrees off.
