Subject: Bus/Vanagon Mirror Deal is a Go.

&gt;I can get original-equipment German side mirrors for Busses for $18.50. 
&gt;This does not include the part that screws into the door (which is 
&gt;another $3.50 if you need it).  Also, OEM German Vanagon mirrors      
&gt;(pre-'89 style) for $19.95.

This is to confirm that I *did* get close to enough orders to buy the 
required quantity of mirrors, so it's a go.  My project this weekend is   
to finish off WCM List Deal #1 (for the Type 2 list), and mirrors are next. 
I will e-mail you to confirm your order late next week.  If you haven't 
ordered mirrors yet, and want to, please include your ZIP code with your 
request and specify Bus or Vanagon. 

To reiterate, since I'm still getting questions on it, the Bus mirrors are 
for '68-79,and the Vanagon mirrors are the type commonly used from '80-88. 
Split-window bus mirrors and Vanagon power mirrors are NOT available from 
this source. (I can get them, but for substantially more money.)

Thanks,
