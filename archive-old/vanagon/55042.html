&gt;I had the opportunity to drive the Subaru conversion about 4 months ago.  I
visted Kennedy Eng. and they were nice enough to allow me to drive their
test bed.  I can say they have done a first class job in the conversion.  As
far as power, this van has lots of guts in will take mountain roads with
plenty of power!  If we were all honest about it, VW didn't do their
homework in making the waterboxer engine.  The Sabura engine is a product of
the late 80's and runs circles around the VW engine.  I love the concept of
the Vanagon and I say anything that will improve its reliability is worth a
look at.
