I've got a nice 65 deluxe 21 window VW bus filled with fond memories of 
chilly dawn patrols in Morro Bay.  Now I live in Idaho and it don't work 
so good for backcountry snowboard expeditions.  Its for sale if anybody's 
interested.
Only an Email away...(ataylor_at_micron_dot_net)
Not exactly surf forum stuff but sometime I'll share microbus-baja 
adventures.
Later
