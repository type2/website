Subject:      WTB: Vanagon Syncro near Philadelphia

     Dear sirs:

     I believe I am writing to the Vanagon mailing list.  If not, then I
     apologize to whomever I have bothered with this letter.

     If I am writing to the correct address, the purpose of my contact is
     to ask if anyone knows of a Vanagon Syncro for sale within about 100
     miles of Philadelphia.  One in good condition would be nice, but also
     one with a single (or so) mechanical failure (blown engine, etc.) for
     cheap money would also be nice.  I'm not interested in a &quot;beater.&quot;

     If, anyone can help me, please reply to me privately, because I am not
     subscribed to the list.

     TIA,

     Chris
