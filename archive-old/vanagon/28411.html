Subject: 1.6L engine in 73 camper

I have a 71 camper with the 1.6 liter type 1 engine.  I have my eye on
a 73 WESTY with no engine.  The cross brace is not even there. 
Someone removed the engine and didn't keep it with the Westy.  The 73
body is cream-puff and I would like to drop my engine or a like
replacement into the 73.  Yes, less power, slower, but at my age, this
makes no difference to me.  I even shunpike when I go across town.  I
am looking for anyone who has gone through this type of conversion and
what experiences I should look out for.  For example, will the engine
sit in the compartment with no changes?  What tin changes had to be
made?  I think the engine will bolt in and best I can tell the bell
houseing and clutch should all be okay.  Right now I need the cross
brace(rear motor support).  I don't know what else I might run into. 
Any suggestions, tips, guidance, offering of prayer to your choice of
Diety for me, would be appreciated.  E-mail me at packrich_at_nando_dot_net.
I am in Durham, NC.
