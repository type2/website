So John Grazul says:
&gt; The motel room that my wife got (for free  through master card)
&gt; reminded us why we ususlly camp.  Not only did the room reek of
&gt; cigarettes but it was filthy by our standards and a child safety
&gt; nightmare!   No play ground, just black top and non-stop bed jumpping
&gt; for the five year old... uugh we couldn't wait to get a shower at
&gt; home and disinfect our stuff!  What an education for the kids though!
&gt; There was a group of hookers working the lobby,  welfare rooms on
&gt; the first floor and constant rap music played through the hotel
&gt; speakers.  I was disappointed that there were no used rubbers under
&gt; the bed or crack vials in the lot.  The westy really fit in along
&gt; with the Arian family from Jersey....my wife will NEVER complain
&gt; about a little rain or lukewarm showers again.

Yeah, we ran into similar problems (although not quite so severe) when
we took a tour of the New England area.  We flew out from Calif. and
were rudely made aware that New Jersey has (or hadn't) any kind of
smoking laws.  Yeeeuck!  I really do appreciate being able to breath
when I eat or doing anything else for that matter.  It's sad that
you have to pay a premium for what should be expected.

I'm looking forward to the trip to Red Rock in my mobile Inn.  Nice
room with a view. :)
