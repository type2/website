So Derek Drew says:
&gt;                      spot in its class with the Volkswagen Vanagon, finished
&gt; ahead of such competitors as the Dodge
&gt;                      Caravan, Ford Aerostar and Plymouth Voyager. 
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I LOVE this statement!

&gt;                      &quot;We've known for years that the MPV was a solid,
&gt; dependable vehicle,&quot; said George McCabe,
&gt;                      senior vice president and general manager of MMA.
&gt; &quot;Still, it is encouraging to have this
&gt; 
&gt;                      Since its introduction as a 1989 model, Mazda has sold
&gt; more than 225,000 MPVs in the United
&gt;                      States, the vast majority of which are still on the road. 
Interesting that an equal statement was not made about the Vanagon....
