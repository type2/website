&gt; of course you know this means war! JPEGS on autodialers oughta do it, stand
&gt; by to be boarded (shut that is)
&gt; 
&gt; If this message appears again at this site I will route the entire contents
&gt; of my 1.7 Gb video hard drive to your mail box, repeatedly.  If you don't
&gt; want this to happen I expect to see an apology posted to this list,
&gt; vanagon_at_lenti within 24 hrs.  Cordially yours, T.J.SmithT.J. Smith,
I think the users of the internet are going to war if this stuff keeps 
up.  I normally just delete the message but now I'm replying and 
attaching a 100k file.  I've thought sending someone a virus was a good 
idea but I'm starting to swing.
