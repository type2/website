Subject: Re: Freeze plug leaking coolant, what to do?

&gt;
&gt;Jeff, in your instructions for removing the heater, when you say
&gt;&quot;get something in behind&quot;, do you mean get something in between
&gt;the heater and the block? How do I otherwise get behind?
&gt;Also, do I risk dropping the &quot;expanding thing behind&quot; if I back out
&gt;the screw too much? How much can I back it out?
&gt;Sorry about this many questions, but I'd be in real trouble if
&gt;I drop something into the block. One last question: When installing
&gt;a block heater do you seal it in any way? Liquid gasket?
&gt;
Martin,
The block heater when installed has three small ears that are larger than
the hole that prevent the heater from falling completely into the hole. You
have to get something under the small tabs to begin the removal process.
This in after the center screw is loosened. You don't have to worry about
the expanding thing falling off. The end of the screw is messed up to
prevent it from coming off completely. You will notice that it got alot
harder to turn or it doesn't even turn at all. Once you get smoething under
the small ears, pry out the heater. Don't try it under just one of the tabs,
it will get cocked in the hole and fight you even more. Work your way around
all the ears and bring it out pretty even. Once it is completely out of the
block you can use a larger pry thing to get behind it and do some serious
bending. We never used any sealant of any kind. We were using only genuine
VW block heaters. Which doesn't mean much because they are made by a company
in Canada. I think some after market heaters are also made by the same
company but I can't remember the name. The heater in my diesel has been
there 7 years without a leak or seep. (Knock on wood) In that time I
replaced the head gasket twice. First time at 2 years. Second time about
three months ago. So I don't think age of coolant has anything to do with
it. HTH
