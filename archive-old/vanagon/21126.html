Yo,

Yesterday was the day from hell for me, but had some interesting VW moments...

I had to run some errans for my SO, and I was driving the bus, which, BTW,
goes about 15MPH faster now the brakes don't drag.

I was going west on Hwy 80 when it just died, and then started up a few 
seconds later although I'd lost critical air speed, and then was on/off/on
off till I could get to the side of the road.

Opened the engine lid, and sure enough the fuel filter was dry, == Out
of Gas so I crawled underneath and flipped the reserve valve.

Engine started up after a few cranks, and I went tearing off to get
back into traffic, only to have the bus die again about 200 feet down the 
road!  It seems I din't have it in the _exact_ proper position...

While I was putzing with this, a guy named Dave stopped in a BeeUTeeFull
58 or 59 (maybe '57) deluxe and offered to help.  There really wasn't much
to do, 'cept twiddle the valve, but the mere fact that he stopped on the
busiest freeway in Sac was a testament that despite the nuclear testing
in Downtown Paris and Horny Greedy Russian women, there are good people
in this world!  Thanks Dave!

Anywho, after work, I set to trying to fix the cable so I don't have to 
crawl under the bus next time.  I got it fixed, although I need a barrel
clamp to complete the job.

I'll write a separate treatise, suitable for framing and archiving, on the
cable fix.

Thom
