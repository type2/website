&gt; Friends.. Is this list great or what?  I'm a tried and true VW Bus driver.
&gt; Your basic '71 Camper with few gagets.  I was recently introduced
&gt; to a real live Vanagon, up close and personal.  A really sweet '85 rig
&gt; with all the goodies.  Anyway, I was stumped when they asked me to look
&gt; at the Propane tank relief (release?) valve for re-charge purposes.  I'm
&gt; a crack, mechanic, but I don't wanna crack the propane tank trying to turn
&gt; something than doesn't turn.  SOOO, I give up.  I looked closely at the
&gt; tank and discovered an encrusted sticker, but it was missing key details,
&gt; like how to open the relief valve....or is it automatic?  Dunno.
&gt;        Searching for meaning,
&gt;         Chris

Chris, my '82 westy has a small tap on the far right side of the tank 
which when screwed out 3 or 4 turns releases the tank pressure for 
filling.  I would asume that the '85's would have same.  
BTW, this is cool, this list.  I have just recently gotten on and even 
more recently figured out how to read the messages.
Thanks to Dave and the others who responded to my question on overheating.
When I figure out this FAQ thing, I will be able to ask someting new(?)
