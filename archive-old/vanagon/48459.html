Subject: CCC's 9/20-22 location?


As many of you know, our Sept. campout promises to be a biggie.  Many
people have indicated serious interest, so it looks like there'll be
a good turn out.  Dave Schwarze and Joel Walker are coming from Texas
and Alabama repsectively.  If you can make only one camping trip this
year, this is definitely the one to put on your calender.

Trying to narrow down a location:  some are coming from southern CA,
and some from northern CA, and of course Dave and Joel from the east.
We're trying to make this as &quot;east&quot; as possible (for D and J, who will
be driving in excess of 24 hours straight to be with us), but still
close enough to the LA and SF areas, so that as many people as possible
who've already indicated interest and have attended many times in
the past will still find it tempting enough to make the drive.

Kathy Myers has suggested the Mammouth area, which is I think southeast
of Yosemite.  In winter this could be tricky to get to with closed
passes, but won't be a problem in September.  Kathy can probably
advise us on the approxomite driving times and best routes, etc.  Kath?
It's at relatively high elevation, so should be a nice escape from
the heat waves.  Temps in about a month are supposed to be 60-70sF
in the daytime, and 30-40s in the middle of the night.  Good climate
to test out that new camping heater you've just installed.  

At any rate, I move that we concentrate on this area.  Kathy has made
a few suggestions, including one place in the wilds which would be
free, and another group site (which is fortunately very reasonably
priced).  I've called the phone number she gave me and am awaiting
information on at least a few of these places.

Do I hear any pros/cons regarding the location?  If we get a group
site, we'll need to get working on reservations, so I'd like to
decided on the location ASAP.  Yays?  Nays?  Lemme know.  The date
is firm:  Sept. 20-22.
