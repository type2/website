Subject: Re: Speaking of Vanagon Shocks

&gt;I was thinking that new shocks may improve the ride/handling on my '87
&gt;Vanagon GL. While browsing the Bentley manual the other day in my spare
&gt;time, I noticed that it says that you need a special tool to undo the top
&gt;nut on the front shocks. Can it really be? Have you guys successfully done
&gt;this at home in your garage (or parking lot) without the VW tool? Also any
&gt;ideas on good replacement shocks?

Rich,
You don't need any special tools on a regular van. The syncro requires
a couple of special tools. Try KYB GR2 or gas adjust for a stiffer ride.
These are the least expensive. Bilstien or Koni are great if money is no
object.
