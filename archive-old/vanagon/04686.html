&gt;No, I'll shake my head in wonder.
&gt;I just tried to rotate the tires on my van, and got a knock in the head 
&gt;trying to turn the lug nuts.  What insanity.  I noticed that there was a 
&gt;lug that was broken off in the left rear, so I didn't even bother 
&gt;trying.  I'll take that to a mechanic.
&gt;
&gt;It's exactly my point, however.  We carry spare tires in our cars, but what
&gt;average driver is going to have the tools to take a tire off when they're
&gt;torqued so tightly.  My standard lug wrench wouldn't do it.  My wife once
&gt;asked me what she should do if she gets a flat tire in a car.  I said call a
&gt;garage.  I think changing tires on the road is a dubious, risky and futile
&gt;process.

...and in today's megalopolises (megalopoly?), a dangerous process to boot.
