Subject: Fixing an 009 distributor?


Finally found out why the timing on my '71 bus is so screwy. It has a
stock 1600 single-port engine (long story), original in all ways except
for the 009 distributor (and one or more rebuilds).

Dwell is 46 degrees. When timing is set to 7.5 degrees, it idles
wonderfully, and never is heard a discouraging word. Going up a steep
hill in second at about 28 mph, it seems to run out of steam-- top
end torque falls off pretty fast.

If I advance the timing a lot, the hill-climb is much better, but
the idle is a little less reliable. And this takes like 20 degrees
initial setting!

Well, long story short, I found that the distributor is only advancing
the timing about 10-12 degrees beyond its original static setting.

Anyone know how to fix this, short of trading it in on a new one?
Shouldn't the distributor advance about 20-22 degrees? For a static
setting of 7.5 degrees, this would give total advance of 27-29 degrees
at high RPMs. If that's not correct, what is the right amount that a
properlyworking 009 should give?

I have modified the advance curve on my V8 Mustang, by taking the
distributor apart, flipping over the advance cam (gives 18 degrees
centfrifugal advance instead of 13), and changing the little springs
that restrain the counterweights in the bottom of the distributor.
I've never opened up an 009, though-- anyone know if it's similar?

Can anyone give me any advice/suggestions/scornful laughs before I
begin to perform brain surgery on my Bosch ignition with an axe?
