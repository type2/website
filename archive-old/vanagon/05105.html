&gt; car, or should we wait 'til after the meeting.  The meeting is 
&gt; next Tuesday, so it is kinda short notice.  Plus, I wonder if she should
&gt; drive the car to a shop or not.  She hasn't driven it since she
&gt; got it out of the shop last time.

Consider taking it to a BMW dealer (this is perhaps the one time I would
do this) to get an estimate for repairs.  Their word will be more credible
than any ole auto shop should this go into arbitration or court.  I would
do it beforehand so you have more &quot;ammunition&quot;.
