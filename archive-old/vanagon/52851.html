Subject: Re: THE BEST BOOK FOR VANAGON REPAIR

I have 3 books covering my '81 Vanagon and the best of the bunch is
the Clymer; clearest, most detailed step-by-step procedures, pretty
good pictures, etc.  However, it seems like Clymer is no longer
publishing auto manuals, so I'd guess you'd just have to get lucky
finding a used one.

I have the Bentley (which I just recently acquired) and my complaints
about this one are: 1) it covers every year of Vanagon every made, so
there's lots of extraneous stuff and 2) is assumes you're a VW mechanic
so the &quot;step-by-step&quot; details are pretty slim.

&gt; get the best deal on one? Anyone want to get rid of an old used book?
