Subject: repair advice needed

I'm in Omaha, NE at the moment, and I just paid too much to have my AC 
recharged.  I wish that some mechanics weren't purposefuly deceptive, but 
they're the only ones who seem to have free time (kinda makes sense 
though).  Unfortunately, it is often the case when you're on the road 
that you can't wait for the good guys to have some free time.

Anyway, my '87 has been pulling to the right, and I took it one place for 
a free check.  They say that my left upper ball joint is going.  They 
also checked the alignment, and the camber on the right wheel was -2.3
As I understand it though, a negative camber on the right wheel should 
make it pull to the left.  Assuming that this computer &quot;analysis&quot; of the 
current state of alignment is irrelevant to my problem, what other causes 
do any of you think might be responsible for pulling tohe right?  One 
mechanic has told me that the upper control arm bushing tends to cause 
this on vanagons as it wears out.  This guy has no time to see me 
though.  Could a bad ball joint on the left possibly cause it to pull 
right?  It only has a little play (though I know it shouldt have any).

This is beyond my areas of expertise, so any knowledge of the list would 
be appreciated.  

Thanks, david
