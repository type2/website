    Anyone care to share?
    
Was on a ferry in Maine and some twerp substituted a
lit cherry bomb for the bread balls folk was pitching
to the seagulls.  Not a road hazard, but all the cars
were covered with blood and feathers.  Captain of the
boat wanted to tie a rope to his foot and tow him home.
