Subject: 40,000 miles in the EV!!!


Yesterday, while driving with the heat full on in both the front
and rear compartments and using the windows to regulate the
temperature ....... &lt;hahahahahah&gt; ...... ok....I didn't do
that, but after the recent discussion (which I helped fuel..)
I couldn't resist.  8-)

But back to the original...as I was heading home from the University
yesterday, the EV odometer rolled onto 40K miles! Judging from
my other watercooled VWs I'm about 20% of the way to an engine replacement.
