        And there's more, my friends,
        where that came from!


        yes, nothing like a verse or two from Spike Milligan to reassure
yourself that things are still sane. Bile? YES I say, blather? why not?
         I subscribe to two lists and rely heavily on this one to preserve 
my (in)sanity! Don't sterilize it just yet please. Yes, we take up 
bandwidth, but I jettison more of a more 'serious' list, percent and volume 
wise, than I do of this list. So please, abuse me some more. I love it.
