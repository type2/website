So William Abbott says:
&gt;
&gt;       What makes CV grease special is that, like tranny oil, it gets between
&gt; two metal surfaces as power is being transmitted between them. Wheel bearing
&gt; grease only carries the wieght of the car. If you think about it for
&gt; a second, all the horsepower of your engine passes THROUGH a thin
&gt; film of CV grease. I can't figure out how to calculate the power
&gt; going through wheel bearings- the load is static, so no 'work' is done,
&gt; but there ARE balanced forces. Given the final drive ratio and the
&gt; gear box ratios, you can calculate the torque going through the
&gt; axles and their CVs- note that all the torque appllied to an axle
&gt; goes through BOTH CVs- its not split, they're in series. It must
&gt; be several hundred foot-pounds in 1st, from a standing start.

Wow Bill!  All of that from one little tube of CV grease....  ;)
