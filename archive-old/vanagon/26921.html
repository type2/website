&gt;      I'm a tad upset about having some jerk glued to my rear
&gt;      bumper AND I STAND ON THE F*****G BRAKES!!! Then give
&gt;      them a nice smile and wave, knowing that they've soiled
&gt;      their shorts in fear of running into me.

&gt;      I'm in the market for a bumper sticker advising tailgaters that
&gt;      tailgating will not make my car go any faster...
&gt; 
&gt;      I can't decide if this is immature driving on my part
&gt;      or a good-natured effort to improve the driving habits
&gt;      of others...


I can assure it is the former...  I know becuase its true about me when I 
do it too....  Eurovans aren't that much faster than older Vw vans.
