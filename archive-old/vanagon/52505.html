Phew! Now I wish that we could turn off the misc. passangers when they get
yammering on and on when I prefer to ride quietly. Shoot, I don't even have
radios in my vehicles! I remember a trip once between Phoenix and LasVegas
in which a co-worker wouldn't shut up...

DOH! Now I get it. Silly me I thought... never mind.  ;-)

BTW: I also heard a radio ad announcing Chysler's invention of the
&quot;Auto-Stick&quot; in their '97 models. Un-huh. add it to the list.
