	I sold my '91 Camper last week (4 speed).
&gt; 
&gt; Took our '91 Camper out for our first camping trip since
&gt; buying it in November. First for some peeves:
&gt; 1. Its power is marginal. Some of the mountain climbs near
&gt; Trail B.C. slowed it down to 40 mph. Petal to the metal, lots of
&gt; buzzy downshifting by the automatic transmission. On gradual slopes
&gt; it usually could stay up to 55 mph.

	Yeah, I learned to be patient. I realize VW has to satisfy the market's
	demand for automatics, but there just isn't power enough in that to
	use a slushbox to push that camper.


&gt; 2. The air conditioning is sub-marginal. Cold air on the back of the neck,
&gt; no air to the face. 

	The A/C is pretty poor especially in hot weather and a complete waste
	with passengers in the back seat in hot weather. They sit under all that
	noise while the driver+ sweats.

	If I had kept mine, I had planned to port the right-most duct into the
	side vent nearby, seal off the fresh air intake in the grill and use
	the ventilation ducts to route cool air to the dash.

&gt; 3. The water fill cover used a plastic key which broke off on first use.
&gt; More water ends up on the ground than in the tank when filling with
&gt; a hose.

	Never had a key problem. And patience is required at fill.

&gt; 4. The sink drain usually didn't. I used a collapsible plastic drain
&gt; bag. Probably need to use a vented bucket.

	I carried a ridgid pan ~20&quot; X 15&quot; X 7&quot; and stored it upside-down
	in the over-cab rack with hoses, powercord underneath.

&gt; 6. Interior lighting is pathetic.
	
	I had (2) clipon lights that mounted to that lip above the stove.
