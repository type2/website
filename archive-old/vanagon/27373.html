&gt; Y'all might want to check out the web site http://ghg.ecn.purdue_dot_edu/.  They 
&gt; have a new technique for lighting the charcoal grill.  First you pour 5 
&gt; gallons of liquid oxygen on the 60lb pile of charcoal.  Then you light it 
&gt; and 3 seconds later 40lbs of it is gone.....

&gt; Bradley - are you there?????

Actually... I saw that sometime ago.  :)  And people on this list think 
thermite is bad?  LOX isn't the nicest stuff in the world, not only will 
it freeze limbs on your body (not trees), it'll then blow up.  :)
