Subject: RE: I put some money down on an '84!!!

I too had bought the Vanagon to carry around my 4 girls in 1984. I still
have the Vanagon
and each of three girls have learned to drive on it.  The '84 is a
Wolfsburg edition
with seats that fold down making a full size bed in the rear and includes
screens and curtains for the windows.  We did lots of camping with the
Vanagon.

I finally had to replace the clutch at 125,000 mi and we just reupholstered
the front
seats.

I'm experiencing rough idle when I first start up.  If I don't let the
engine warm up
the car loses power and stalls in the first mile of driving.  Have you
experienced this
problem and do you have any suggestions to fix this.

Regards...an '84 Vanagon owner
