&gt;I was told by a VW dealer rep recently that starting with 1995 models,
&gt;the camper outfitting of the Eurovan will be done by Winnebago....cheaper
&gt;to deliver a finished producet. Lower prices to consumer.

yeah, but that 'lower prices' is a crock ... according to the RV Buyer's
Guide. the volkswagen version of the winnebago modification of a eurovan will
cost over $30,000 ... and the Riata (the winnebago version of the same thing)
will be over $40,000!!!  i don't see how vw will sell too many of those.
the winnebago version looks like that Renault powered thing they used to
have ... LeSharo or something like that.  if anybody is really interested,
they have the specs on both in the 1994 RV Buyer's Guide (at fine bookstores
and magazine counters everywhere).
