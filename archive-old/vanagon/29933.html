Sorry Tim, I couldn't disagree with you more.  I spent 3 YEARS dicking 
around with VW, Bentley and Bosch, trying to get my van to pass 
emissions.  It had been proven to me that the problem was with the AFC, 
but not even a test of the unit by Bosch showed any problems.  It wasn't 
until I went outside of the allowable trouble shooting routines that I 
was able to get the van to pass.  Popped the top on the AFC and set the 
spring tension tighter to lean out the mix.  This was after working 
directly with the techs on the Bosch hotline over a period of several 
weeks, running voltage and resistance checks on the AFC and peripheral 
components.  Everything was well within limits according to Bosch, the 
designer/manufacturer of the system.

That was my last straw.  If that didn't fix the problem I was going to 
have to get a 3rd waiver in as many years.  It wasn't until someone on 
the list suggested that fix to the AFC that I even thought it was 
possible.  That certainly isn't one of the solutions suggested by Bosch 
or Bentley.

Now I don't know what type of FI is installed in your van.  It may be 
simpler to diagnose and fix.  I know that my Rabbit's CIS system is 
_much_ simpler than the L-Jetronic in my van.  But I don't think that 
your comments apply to everyone's vans, just your own.

Btw, I've been working on various cars, Euro and American for the last 20 
years or so _and_ I've got a degree in electronics.  I agree that for the 
majority of problems your observations are sound.  But not all of them.

Jack
