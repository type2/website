Subject: RE: 911 engine conversions


	someone had asked about the smog on these conversions.
	Here is how I understand it for California (which should be 
acceptable in the other states).
	1) If the engine is older than the vehicle to which it is 
installed, the smog controls should match the vehicle and the CO, NOx, 
etc. numbers should also match that vehicle and year.
	2) If the engine is newer, then the smog controls should be the 
for that engine and from the same year as well.  

	Of course there may be some loop holes, but essentially I think it 
is very doable.  
	Does any one else know more?
	Walt
