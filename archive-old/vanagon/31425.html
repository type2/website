Subject: EVers...Want me to get stuff in Yurrup?


I am planning on trying to hit one or more VW dealers while over there...

I know some people have expressed some desire for things like ventshades,
etc for their EVs...

I'm willing to pick stuff up...if you are willing to send me some money
in advance...

E-mail me if you are interested.

Ric
