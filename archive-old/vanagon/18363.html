Subject: Re: Tires for '76 Westy

I have a '73 Sportsmobile that I just threw new sneakers on all the way
around.  I went to Dunn Tire in Buffalo, NY and had 205/75/15 Kelly Safari
AWR light-truck tires mounted, balanced, valved, with road hazard protection
for $300.  The new rubber works GREAT!  Ride quality is tons better and tire
noise is now a thing of the past.  Also, I think the wider profile has given
me marginally better handling, although this could be my warped imagination!
 These tires are mostly for street-driven trucks and are not the huge knobby
clodbustin' tires you see on 4x4's.  Anywho, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND these
tires for anyone looking for good replacement rubber for your Bus, Vanagon,
or Eurovan!
