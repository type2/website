Subject: road hazards

Hey now,
        I just about hit a cat tonight. Went to the store for milk, and on
the way in the gutter was a cat which I nearly nailed. This is a busy 3
lane road (South Riverside, if you know Austin), not a neighborhood street.
Flipped a U, put on the hazards, and took a look. Poor thing must've been
hit just before I got there, it was dazed and had a cut on the front leg, a
little blood around the nose and eyes, but none around the ears. I pet it a
little, then it started heaving and coughing, so I rummaged through the car
for a blanket or something. Figured I'd try and find an animal hospital
open at 9:30pm, that would take a hurt cat. Yeah, I know, but I like to
think positive. Found an old seat cover I've kept for a rag, went back to
pick it up. It was more awake now, and looked scared-no wonder-and hissed a
little. When I reached for it again it took off down the street and into
the weeds beside the road. At least I gave it time to recover, someone else
might have hit it again and done it in. I hope the poor cat makes it.
        What kind of person would nail an animal and just drive on? That's
pretty goddamned fucked.
        VW content? I was driving the bug. Not even a type 2. So sue me.

Peace,
