What with all the bandywith over our small furry friend,  here is a tidbit
that may amuse some... this was culled from the Phish_dot_net.The road was his end
I come from atop the mountain baby
Where the people come to pray
I come from atop the mountain baby
Where the people come to pray
There ain't no truth in action
'Less you believe it anyway

I was riding down the road one day and
Someone hit a possum
I was riding down the road one day and
Someone hit a possum
The road was his end
His end was the road
So they say

Whoa possum...  possum, possum...  POSSUMWhoa possum...  possum, possum...
POSSUM
Whoa possum, possum
Your end is the road

THIS is the origin of the bumper sticker.
