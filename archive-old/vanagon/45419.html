Hi V_at_Lers,

Thanks to one and all on the list for making my online time productive and
entertaining. Business and vacation take me away for most of a month, so,
I'll be back then. And if you see a blue and white split heading north for
Montana with a grinnin' idiot in it (an idiot drives throught it), honk and
wave cause it's moi.

Regards, Jim
