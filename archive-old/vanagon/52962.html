Subject: 87 GL Radiator Replace: How Many times to refill reservoir befor uneasiness?

Hey Volks,
Assistance Requested: 
I had the radiator replaced about two weeks ago. We drove the Vanagon for two days 
and I checked the overflow and it was dry, I figured it sucked the coolant in due to 
turning both heaters on which were off during bleeding at the shop (Non-Fatherland). 
I topped the reservior (the header tank was full) and now two weeks the reservior is 
empty again with the header tank full. I have been looking very carefully for any 
leaks but can see none anywhere underneath. Anybody have their rig drink in two full 
reserviors full of coolant after a radiator change. Or is there a definite leak 
amongst my Vanagon. Any ideas appreciated.
Regards
