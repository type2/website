I put mine in a 3-gauge enclosure (made by VDO) and mounted that on top of 
the instrument cluster. Looks good and the gauges are visible without 
looking down or to the side. Only problem is that at night I get a bit of 
reflection on the windshield from the gauge illumination. I'm working on 
solving that (for now i just &quot;shade&quot; them with a map or dish towel or 
whatever is handy).
