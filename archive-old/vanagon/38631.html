My bus turned psycho today.

I stopped by a garage sale, didn't find anything cool, went to leave,
turned the key to start the bus, and nuthin' - no growl, no click, nothing.

Got out to do the obligatory cable check, yanked on the battery cables,
and the starter kicks in.  And the bus is in gear!  I instintcively pull
the coil wire, but that does not good because the key is not on! 

So I'm sitting there, straining to hold the lurching bus back by the bumper,
I finally cry out &quot;help!&quot; louder and louder until someone hears me.  This
15 year old or so girl comes running over, and I tell her &quot;hit the brake!&quot;
so she runs to the cab, only to return in about 10 seconds:  &quot;which one's
the brake?&quot;  

So anyway, she finds it, pushes it with her hand, and gets the bus to stop.
I go up and take it out of gear.  After that it started.  Wierd.  I think
I'm going to replace the starter (which is the old one I replaced before
but put back in yesterday) with the one I exchanged last night.

The other funny thing was when I bought my battery cables. I walk into the 
the store, and the guy does the standard &quot;can I help you find something?&quot;
Yes, battery cables. &quot;Right this way.  How long you need them?&quot;  Oh, 5 or
6 years or so. 

Then I asked for VW exhaust clamps.  &quot;sorry, I don't have any of those.&quot;
Oh, well can you ask the other clerk and see if he has any?

&quot;Hilarities&quot; was Socrates's cousin, the failed stand-up comedian.
