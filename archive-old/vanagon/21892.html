Subject: Where is my engine number?

Yet another question:

Where is my engine ID number? I looked under the generator pedastal, and
all I see is the letter &lt;M&gt;. I guess what I really want to know is what
does the single notch on the crank pulley mean. I'm guessing 5 degrees
atdc. I want to check my timing at full advance (bosch 009) which I'm told
should be 32 degrees at 3500 rmp.

Or should I just forget the crank marks and find tdc with a pencil or
something in the cylinder and get a stick a degree wheel on?
Thanks
