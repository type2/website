Subject: 1985 Transmissin'


I have finally decided to (knock wood) keep the old Westy and get the Windstar
for my wife, as our second kid is on the way.  Iam glad to have found this
resource, and have a number of questions that I would like to throw out there
from time to time, for instance...

Last fall, (about 5000 miles ago) my '85 transmission (130,000) mi started
acting really wierd, it became, almost instantly, very difficult to change
some gears, particularly third to fourth, and second to third.  I thought it
was linkage and adjusted, but that did not help.  My trusty mechanic (factory
trained) thought the tranny might be going, but decided to change the gear
oil, and put in a Slick 50 like lubricant.  This helped considerably, and now,
when the engine is warm, the tranny almost feels normal.  The tranny does not
grind, or pop out of gear.I have thought about finding one with a dead engine
and a good trans and swapping, but now don't think I need to.

Questions:  Has this happened to anybody else, or does anybody know what it
is?

I'm told transmissions are pretty good on this bus.  Anybody else had to
replace one?

Are the interior shift forks visible and accessable by just dropping the
trans, or do you have to do a full rebuild.

Any reccomendations on lubricant? Militec?

Is the old trans likely to last, or should I buy the parts bus if it comes up?
(I also need a new steering rack, have worn but repacked CV's, plus God knows
what else will go wrong)

Also, on the steering rack.  When it started leaking, and not one of ten local
VW shops would replace seals, I decided to take the belt off the pump and
drive it as a manual steering car,thereby not killing the pump.  My mechanic
said the power rack has a design flaw, and even a new one will never last all
that long.  I am now toying with the idea of putting a non-power rack on, as
thay are cheaper and more reliable.  I'm told the steering column  is
different, so that needs replacing also.

Any body ever done this?  Anybody have a power rack that hasn't started
leaking?  Am I in danger by driving mine dry?

Thanks
Peter
