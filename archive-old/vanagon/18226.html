Subject: RE: luggage rack / sunroof??

Semi-serious suggestion about bus cooling:  ICE makes aftermarket air
conditioning systems for VW vehicles.  Rather than adding the compressor
to a bus engine's already heavy load, mount the compressor on a lawn-mower
engine on the roof.

Incidentally I just talked to ICE about their Vanagon airconditioning.
About $1300, but a &quot;difficult&quot; installation involving relocating the radio
so the airco ducting can pass through the dash there.  At least you don't
have the &quot;airco of Damocles&quot; hanging over your head as on the VW system.

ICE system is set up for R134 refrigerant, supposedly more reliable than
VW, and I think has option of a second evaporator for the rear seats.

ICE is at 1 800 845 0424.  Don't tell them about the lawnmower engine idea --
they'll think Vgon people are wacky.  (But why shouldn't it work?  Set it
to run low but continuous -- probably get pretty decent &quot;mileage&quot; out of
it.)
