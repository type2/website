Subject: Installing grease fittings

I checked under the front of the '73 Campmobile last night and noticed that 
the rubber around some of the steering linkage pieces has torn and some 
fallen off.  I believe that these are all original parts.  The problem is 
that there aren't any grease fittings on these pieces to lube them and keep 
the dirt and water out.  The question is this - can these all be drilled and 
fittings put in, or am I stuck with just waiting for them to wear out and 
replace them with aftermarket that has fittings.  If I remember correctly, 
the only grease fittings that I have on the bus are one at each end of the 
four front axle tubes, one in the middle of the lower tube and a couple that 
I had installed in the rear bearing carriers so I could grease the rear 
bearings without taking them apart.  TIA
