Subject: Re: Bus Vulture stalks another victim

&gt;Well today I am off on a safari to deepest darkest Alabama in search of
&gt;a '59 Westfalia.

yeah dave! i for one would like to hear about this westy. does it have
those much sought after tumblers with it? there is supposed to be a 58'
Westfalia up in these parts, but i am sure it is nowhere a good a shape as
the busses down there in forrest gump land (no dis' intended :). However
your story gets me inspired to go check out some leads i have on a 54'
Deluxe i know of and a 56 Kombi.

Hey while i think of it, anybody out there interested in a late 50's
refridgerator van? the van is history but the fridge stuff is supposed to
be complete and in good shape. apparently there are VW logos (?) all over
the inside that testify to the fact that the refridge interior was
manufactured for or by VW (?) Can't say i know much about fridge stuff so
if anybody knows more than i please speak up!

talked to a friend of mine last night who is restoring a late
(non-barndoor) 1955 kombi (here in toronto). the van is fairly straight and
original but is missing quite a few parts. I told my friend that i would
post to inquire about parts availability. The items he is looking for are

* front and back ribbed bumpers
* semaphores.
* glass tailights
* headlights

he is really quite keen to get the semaphores and bumpers, and taillights,
but i cautioned him that items such as these (in good shape) cost $$$$$,
but he says hey no problem he just sold the 60' Ghia he had that he
purchased from the original owner to a film production company D'oh!

BTW can anybody tell me if headlights from a 66' bus would fit his 56?
glancing thru st. muirs book last night re: type II changes, he has a note
that headlights changed in 64. how pray tell did they change? did they
change is lighting properties, or is he saying that post 64' headlights
won't fit pre' 64 headlight buckets. What i am trying to figure out is
could the headlights i have from a 66' Kombi fit his 56?
