Subject: '94 Diesel EV - any problems?

After finally getting tired of listening to two other family members 
rant about their Westy's, my father is finally looking at one...

He would something newer, with air, and possibly diesel. First one 
that came up is a '94 EV Diesel for $29k CDN, 50k km on it.

1&gt; It's a short wheelbase Westy model, according to the picture (must 
be one of the last I guess). Are there any problems specific to the 
EV Westy's? He's not too worried about camping space.

2&gt; I'm assuming the engine is a 5cyl Audi diesel - is this correct? 
Are there any known problems with this engine? (ie: piston slap)

3&gt; Any other general comments, on either EV diesels, or EV Westy 
would be appreciated.

tia.
