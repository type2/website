&gt; Hello,
&gt; Has anyone considered an anti-theft device for the diesel vanagons?
&gt; I mean, not an alarm, etc?  What options are there for these things?
&gt; I have considered putting a relay over the glow plug line which would
&gt; only allow the glow plugs to heat if the switch is thrown, but there
&gt; are probably other alternatives which might be better.
&gt; Does anyone have an idea?

  Some form of written warning about how fast the &quot;getaway&quot; vehicle is may be
  enough...... (big grin and giggle). 

  Seriously, some of the school buses I drove when I was in college had valves
  in the fuel lines. Valve shut - she don't run. Maybe a solenoid operated
  valve conveniently actuated by a hidden switch reachable from the driver's 
  seat??
