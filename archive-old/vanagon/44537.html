Subject: cb channel question

OK, one last cb question that I forgot to ask. Those of you with cb's, what
generally are good channels to listen to as far as truckers, etc.  There has to
be a channel or two that truckers use as a default or else they'd never be able
to talk to each other.  It is a little dangerous to be flipping through all 40
channels while driving, so I was wondering if the above is the case.  Obviously,
if I got a morbid fascination, I could monitor channel 9 all the time, but
nothing much seems to be going on there.  Any ideas folks?

Thanks,
Sean
