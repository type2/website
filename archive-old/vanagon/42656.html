Subject: Re: Engine misfires?

&gt;&gt;I have a problem with the engine on my 85 Vanagon GL &quot;stumbling&quot; or
&gt;&gt;misfiring on an intermittent basis.  It usually misfires or bucks once or
&gt;&gt;twice and then runs fine for a while (10-20 minutes).  Other than this
&gt;&gt;problem the engine runs great.  (This van has 194000 miles, with about 15000
&gt;&gt;miles on a replacement, VW-remanufactured engine).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I have tried to determine if it occurs under particular conditions (cold
&gt;&gt;engine, warm engine, cruising, accelerating, etc) but can't be sure.

Generally speaking, this is often caused by particles in the fuel system or
a clogged fuel filter...do you have two filters? I think so, check both
also have your injectors cleaned.

Good luck
