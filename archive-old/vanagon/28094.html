Subject: Panamint Springs Campout

I'm getting all set for this next weekend's campout in 
Panamint Springs - do we need any specific campground 
reservations, etc.?  Anything special to bring? (I know 
Bradley's got the Mg engine cases and Thai videos covered, so 
I'm leaving those at home.)  I remember something about a 
Chili Cookoff - is it happening there already or are we &quot;it&quot;?
