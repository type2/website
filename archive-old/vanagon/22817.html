Subject: Factory Eurovan Tools For Sale Cheap

I notice that I have the following factory VW tools for Eurovan for sale. I
don't know the price I will sell them at yet, but I will try to get to this
a little later. It would be a fraction of what the VW dealers pay Zelenda
for their tools.

Tool /  Description

2024A/1             Bracket
3227                   Engine bracket
3248                   Counter Holder
3190A                Centering Mandrel
3254                   Open End Wrench Ultra Thin/Strong [50]
3250                   Support Frames
