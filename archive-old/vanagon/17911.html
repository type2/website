&gt;A legal question here...but Joel, who owns the copyright to this
&gt;stuff...do you, or does the State of Allybammah as a work made
&gt;for hire?
&gt;Curiously, your Yankee Schiester Friend,

the song continues:

That fellow who's a lawyer, he drives a Eurovan,
And loves to brag and carry on, whenever that he can,
But just in case his rough approach should irritate your mind,
Remember: &quot;Lawyer&quot;'s just another word for &quot;Crooked, Cheap, and Blind.&quot;

:)

even the Great State of the Grand and Glorious Poobah of Possum, the state
government of Amabala, cannot prove that i don't write these at home, in my
hovelic haven, while drifting away in a drunken stupor (the 2-door model).
ergo i retain all rights, commercial and otherwise, (and lefts, too!) to
any and all content of remotely possible monetary value whatsoever wherefore
and thereto. permission is hereby granted to all readers of this list to
sing, recite, hum, whistle, or otherwise invocate, commuicate, equivocate,
or expectorate any and all selections, passages, or tidbits wherever found
by means electronic, phonic, or supersonic, and should any such aforementioned
activities cause bodily harm, mental anguish, or financial gain or loss, we
(party of the first part) are hereby deemed irresponsible and flatulently
void of all liability, past, present, or future.

please pay at the door on your way out.
