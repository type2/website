Regarding new heads,
 expect to pay at least $2000 to have a mechanic with VW experience do it.
It's probably better to budget  $2600-$3000 for the job before its all done.
For example, if the clutch is worn it should be replaced, some pipes
in the exhaust manifold might have to be replaced with the heads etc.
 Also remember that new heads will increase the coolant pressure
and you might find cracks in the coolant system that didnt leak before.
 The pitting that usually makes new heads necessary is really very very
shallow, it's a pity no one has found a reliable way to weld or fill those very small pits!
 
 Good luck and enjoy!
  Bill
