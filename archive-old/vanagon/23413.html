We've had trouble with the oil light on our '92 Cabriolet.  After everything 
else failed, we tried a VW oil filter at the next oil change (using the oil 
the dealer used) and now the oil light doesn't flicker, or flash at a red 
light.  The VW filter must cause more back-pressure to build up in the 
system.
