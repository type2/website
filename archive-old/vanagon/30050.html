Subject: Auxilliary Light in Engine Bay

My '72 bus has a plastic plug attached to the &quot;roof&quot; over the engine, 
on the right over towards the battery. Apparently it was for some sort of 
computer analysis plug connection but was never used in Australia.

In the middle of the array of connections are two wide 'female' 
connectors which would appear to take a 9mm+ 'male' spade connector. From 
the two wide connectors, one wire (brown) goes to earth and the other 
(red with white stripe) appears to go to the voltage regulator via a 
common connector with a similar coloured wire from the battery.

My question is, can I use the two wide connectors as an auxilliary power 
source to run a trouble light when I am working in the engine bay? Will I 
do any damage to the regulator? I intend using a small caravan/camper 
type fluorescent light as the trouble light. 

Thank you in anticipation
