Subject: MECHANICS IN SO. JERSEY

With all the talk about good shops in northern and central New Jersey, I was
wondering if anyone has any recommendations for South Jersey ?  I'm very
close to philly (Just across the Walt Whitman or Commadore Barry) so shops in
philly would be ok.  I haven't been able to find a mechanic or shop that I
feel comfortable with working on my Vanagon. 

I don't have any major crisis right now, but would like to have someone I can
trust when it does happen.

Two quick questions: 
1) I have a noise in the front end, I think, that is kind of a whining sound.
 Wheel bearings ? 
2) Engine skips or hesitate sometimes when first started.  Completly goes
away once the engine is warmed up after 15 - 20 mins.  Engine has new plugs,
cap and rotor.  Could this be related to the throttle body problem that has
been discussed in the past?

TIA
