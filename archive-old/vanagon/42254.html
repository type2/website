&gt;ago (sigh). I feel
&gt;unloved. :(
&gt;        But anyhow, Ill just ask em again.
&gt;
&gt;1) while I was fixing my rear windsheild wiper problem, I removed the fluid
&gt;container from inside the rear passenger side wall and noticed that some
&gt;fluid must have leaked out, resulting in a bit of
&gt;rust inside the walls over the rear wheels. Should I just scrape this away
&gt;and throw some promer on it or what?
I suppose that sanding and priming or putting in new metal depending on the
extent of the rust would probably be the recommended fix.  There's also stuff
called Extend (brand name) that is a rust sealant/converter.  You scrape off
the excess rust and then spray this on.  It forms a bond with the rust (or
maybe reacts with it), and leaves a hard black finish that can be painted.
