	I post this reluctantly....................


	'91 Westy Camper For Sale	$21K 	Portland, OR area 

	Original owner
	43K Miles
	4 Speed
	Burgundy Clearcoat
	A/C
	Power Windows &amp; Locks
	Alloys
	Front End Cover
	Aux Deep Cycle Battery with Isolator
	Sony CD Player W/ Removable Face

	New in the last (2) months:

	(4) Michelin MX L (reinforced)
	Oxygen Sensor
	Fuel Filter
	Injectors (RV Recall)
	Plugs


	Castrol 20-50 &amp; Fram every 3K
	Almost Exclusively Chevron Supreme


	This cruiser is about as clean as can be found. It's been driven very
	easy (no ugly roads, gentle shifting).

	The only problems besides the need for the injector recall:
	
	Rear hatch struts failed early. Replaced via warranty.
	Thermostat housing leaked slowly. Whole housing &amp; thermo replaced.
	A/C needed evacuating &amp; recharge this year.

	I'm reluctantly selling because I've recently purchased a new(old)
	house with no garage and have decided it's an extravagance for me now.
