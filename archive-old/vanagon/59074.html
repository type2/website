Subject: Re: Oil Filter

Oil will run cooler when engine is filled to somewhere between the add and
fill marks on the dipstick. Dennis Haynes (dhaynes57_at_msn_dot_com) first pointed
this out and I have observed it to be true on my 87 2.1l Vanagon (I have oil
temp gauge). Now as to why this is so, I'm not sure. Dennis, do you have an
explanation for this phenomena?
