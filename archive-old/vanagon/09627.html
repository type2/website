&gt;   I went up to Kohlweiss yesterday and bought those little rubber plugs to
&gt;   keep water from getting in to the rear brakes through the adjusting holes.
&gt;   All I need now is a dry spot so I can crawl under and put them in.
&gt;   I parked it recently with wet brakes, set the parking brake, and when I 
&gt;   came back the brakes had seized. It took a substatial application of power
&gt;   and clutch slipping to get them to break loose! Is this a result of metallic
&gt;   pads? Is is stupid to set the parking brake when it is wet out?
&gt; 
I had that problem of seizing brakes when they were wet with my '73. Got 
so bad that I started carring a small hammer - just a tap on the drums 
would free them right up. 
When all else fails - force it! :) We are also in the Bay Area - don't 
look up - you can drown.
