In the continuing saga of the '67 &quot;Westy Resto from Hell&quot;...

I stopped by the body shop the other morning as I do most mornings
now-a-days and asked the proprietor &quot;What kinda cake do you want?&quot; &quot;No man,
we're OK.&quot; he mumbled. I quickly realized that he surmised that I was asking
in the oft used jive language if I was current on my bill and if he wanted
some cash flow. Sorry, but at this point he is gonna have to crowbar
cashflow outta me and show me a painted bus before I step up with any more
moola. &quot;No, I think you misunderstood me,&quot; I say. &quot;I thought seeing as we
have been married to each other for A YEAR NOW (insert Sam Kinison) I
thought the least I could do is show up real soon with a cake, balloons,
flowers, offer to take you out for dinner and maybe a movie afterwards. Who
knows you might even get a kiss!&quot; ;)
He just kinda looks at me dumbfounded for a second then gets rather
indignant. &quot;Yeah OK, I'm busting my butt trying to get this thing outta here
and move on with life.&quot; &quot;Good concept&quot; I tell him! =)

BTW: I cringe as I notice that two other VWs are waiting in line to be done
at this shop of horrors. If you live in the Phoenix metro area and own a VW,
I would suggest that you pick a shop very carefully or prepare for a long
long long (I mean long) wait. Familiarize yourself with the word &quot;Colostomy&quot;
(Hint: It has nothing to do with the stars).

Business lesson one: 
Provide a product or service and you will get paid. Do this and you can stay
in business.

Business lesson two:
Word of mouth is either your best advertising or worst enemy.
