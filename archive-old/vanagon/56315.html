Subject: stupid, ignorant question

Yes I'm ignorant (at least about this ...)

Where is the starter on an 87 vanagon?  It finally warmed up enough, and
wasn't raining, to where I could try to get my alternator working. 
Connections at the alternator are okay (cleaned them all up anyway), but
someone told me that the connections at the starter may be causing the
trouble.  So where IS the starter?  And what does it look like?

Also, on a weird note, the battery has 11 volts across it when NOT
connected to the engine.  When I connect the ground strap, it has 9
volts across the terminals.  Back at the alternator (with the key in the
on position, engine off), it reads 7 volts.  This doesn't seem right. 
Any ideas?

Brushers on alternator looked okay at quick glance, but wanted to check
all the connections before I passed judgement.  I've got the battery out
of the van currently and hooked to a charger.

TIA everyone!
Tonya
