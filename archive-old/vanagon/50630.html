&gt; Howdy, Could someone point me to the page(s) in the Bentley which illustrate
&gt; the lube points for a late model vanagon.  
&gt;
&gt;most everything is lubed for life(however long it lasts).  Only parts
&gt;requiring lube are the C/V joints and wheel bearings and this takes some
&gt;effort.
&gt;
 Hi: The syncro front wheel bearings are even sealed. Run 'em till they
fail. Mine failed at 158,000, but I think that was due to the axle nut
getting loose.
