Subject: Mildew removal?-Westy roof liner
Date: Sat, 1 Jun 96 15:52:40 -0400
From: Dennis Kutchera &lt;kutchera_at_istar_dot_ca&gt;

Today, on the first warm day here in foggy Halifax, I popped open the top 
on my 81 Westy. I was mortified to find hundreds of little black dots of 
mildew all over the fuzzy roof liner in the area where it touches the 
flipped back bed deck (which also sustained some minor staining). 

Does anyone have a fool proof way of cleaning the black stains without 
removing the original puke eggnog colour of the fuzz (and of course not 
removing it completely down to bare metal) and/or stopping the further 
spread of this plague.
