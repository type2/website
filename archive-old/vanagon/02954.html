Subject:      any frozen cable solutions



As a hippie wantabe I guess I don't have any great sentimental philosophical
pronouncements on the times ago, nor will I point out the summer of love came
before the daze of do date drug. I could use some help on a frozen cable
though. I'm trying to get this 68 ready to sell but keep having problems
getting my brakes adjusted. In the process I found one is frozen in the metal
tube. I broke off most of the part hanging out of the hub trying to get it
out. Any groovy ideas on how to fix this with a minimum investment. I had a
great idea once for fixing a similar situation with heater cables but have no
idea what to do here. Thanks.
