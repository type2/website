&gt;Good news and bad news.  The good news is my water pump on my 86 
&gt;Westy is fine.  The bad news is the head gaskets must be repaced.
&gt;Quoted up to $2000 for the job, depending on the condition of the 
&gt;heads.  I'm in NY, if you know of a mechanic or have any 
&gt;suggestions.  Help?  :-{(

I was quoted about $2,000 to $2,300 by VW dealers for this job including 2
new heads.  I sure hope the &quot;depending&quot; part meant: &quot;It will be less if we
don't need to replace the heads&quot;

Good luck,
