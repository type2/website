Subject: 34 Pict-3 adjustment

Can anyone give me a short sermon on how to adjust the 34 Pict-3 carb?  It
has two screws on the left side and one on the rear that points to the
stepped edge of the fast idle cam.  Which is the mixture screw?  What is the
other one?  Idle adjustment?  How do I adjust them?  Any help will be very
appreciated.
