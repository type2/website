Subject: Leaking Brake Fluid
Date: Thu, 29 Sep 1994 15:31:58 -0400 (EDT)



My '84 Vanagon is leaking hydraulic fluid.  The fluid is dripping from the 
lowest point on the clutch master cylinder onto the steering shaft.  The 
bottom side of the power booster sitting above the clutch master cylinder
appears to be damp as well.  I have yet to remove the instrument cluster
to get a better look from above, but I hope to do so this weekend.

I was wondering if there is a common point of failure in this area.  The
Bentley leads me to believe that the brake master cylinder and power booster 
are serviced from above by removing the instrument cluster and the clutch
master cylinder is serviced from below by a contortionist.

Looking for any and all relevant information.

Thanks.
