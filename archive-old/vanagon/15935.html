Subject: What to look out for in used/rebuilt carbs



I'm thinking of buying a pair of used webbers for my bus.

The ad claims they were rebuilt.  The price is quite attractive
and I'm planning to check them out.

Can anyone suggest things to look at?  Crucial tolerances that can
be eyeballed, colorations, wear, replaced parts, etc?

Much obliged,
...Markus
