Subject: Re: Pilot bearing removal.


Hey, I wish I had though of that!!!  Your solution is definately much more
elegant than mine.  Here is what I did (stupid me).  I pounded one of those
cheapie jewlers screwdrivers between the bearing casing and the flywheel.
The hardened casing eventually cracked and I was able to twist it into a 
pretzel shape and pull it out.

On a similar note, is it possible to put a cap on the end of the transmission
shaft.  The tip of mine was chewed up pretty good the last time my pilot
bearing went south.  Can I machine the shaft without taking the transmission
appart?
