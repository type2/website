re the CR article on oil:
I tried to report all the qualifications for their tests that I remembered.
I did forget that stuff about the Slik-50 treatments.
I guess what was more interesting was that *under these conditions* the
brand of oil made no difference in the results.
If you own an air-cooled, clearly you're risking your engines life by
applying the above results to your vehicle! Relative to engine cost, 3
months/3K mile oil changes seem prudently inexpensive.
And even if you don't change the oil that frequently, do get under it and
look around on a regular basis.

&gt;From the research I've seen on oil, most of it Net-based but also talking
with mechanics, there is a strong tendency to believe the 7500 mile/6 month
intervals
suggested for average use.
The regimen I follow varies with the car:
1984 Volvo, non-Turbo: every 6 months, Mobil 1; daily driver but &lt; 7000 miles/yr
1975 GMC pickup, every 6 months, using dino oil; its an occasional hauler.
1980 Vanagon: every 3 months (never exceeded 3000 miles), except now that
I'm not driving it much its overdue - but I picked up a filter last
weekend.
1995 EV: 3500 miles/6 months. Primary use is long trips. Once it hits 7K
I'll switch to Mobil 1 and change it every 6 months.

re CCC trip:
How about stretching northwards just a little more. I think Redding is
about a (long) day's drive from Seattle. Perhaps somewhere in that vicinity
would enable an entire West Coast gathering!

re CB channels:
on I-5, ch 19 is primary, ch 17 is supposed to be getting some traffic, and
ch 13 is the &quot;Good Sam RV&quot; channel. I've never heard much traffic on any of
them though. Since there are repeaters up and down the coast, there is a
lot of 2M out there, but you have to pass a test to operate there.
