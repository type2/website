Subject: Re: Urgent Bus SOS follow up..

Sounds like you need to implement some basic troubel shooting techniques 
in your algorhythm.  If the bus was running fine before you made your 
mods, look at the changes you made and see where you went wrong.  Unless 
you severely mucked something unrelated to the mods I'd look there first.
