Subject:      Off to the Land of Enchantment!

The VanBondo family singers and flying circus will be heading down I-40 this
weekend to attend the Albuquerque (hot air) Balloon Fiesta and Jerry Garcia
memorial food drive thingie. We will be looking to hook up with the Route66
Splits and others from all around. Im afraind that this will have to be the
last road trip of the year for us. Mandatory OT at the job is about to
explode. Besides I'm getting a tad road weary. &lt;light weight&gt;.

BTW: I will be getting a set of the Yokohama 370-47's on the RFH early
tomorrow. I had to prod the Phoenix regional Yoko rep to locate a set out of
LA for me. Initially he told me that they were &quot;discontinued&quot; until I told
him about the email list discussions and how several folks have found sets
recently. He finally confessed that Yoko keeps intending to cut them out of
the line in favor of the new 356 &lt;?&gt; products. Supposedly, the 356's don't
have the all season ratings and are fifty cents more spendy. I will be
trading in the 185/14 non reinforced tires that I bought and have drven so
far. I find that the 185/14 non LT tires that I bought were rather scary at
times. I felt like I was riding on marshmallows.
See ya'll in Albuquerque!
