Subject: Recent Observations-

Seen: at &quot;A Sharper Image&quot; a model micro bus.  Not sure on the terminology
here, it was red body, white top, split windshield.  Couldn't see the right
side, but got the impression of double doors on the right in lieu of a sliding
door.  I recall not only the usual windows, but also the (Safari???) windows
around the perimiter of the roof.  3 bench seats, about 6&quot; long, maybe 4&quot;
high, 3&quot; wide.  Price was about $35.

Not seen:  Antonio VW in Sunnyvale has always had at least 3 -5 Vanagons on
their used vehicle lot for sale.  Some were Westfalias, others plain vans,
some Vanagons, and some older &quot;loaf&quot; types.  When I had clutch problems a few
weeks ago they had none on their lot, and when I went by today still had none.
 Are Vanagons etc. becoming scarce critters??

Happy New Year All!!!  Keep it safe so we can continue on in the New Year!
