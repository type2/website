Subject: Re: Opinions on WCM products?

We use quite a bit of WCM Rubber in our restorations and have not had any
problem with seal fit or construction other than an occasional imperf or
mold overrun.  A couple of years ago I believe we got a defective set of
door seals, but nothing that couldn't be worked around.  Personally I like
WCM's pop-out window seals (read... molded &amp; contoured) and inner scraper
seals better than anything else I've found on the market. Unlike other
&quot;Brands&quot; WCM's seals dryfit snugly and seat properly whereas others have a
tendancy to sag and deform...

Can't say we've had much luck ordering other &quot;catalog&quot; items from WCM tho.
Seems alot of the stuff they list is either O.O.S. (Out Of Stock) or B.O.
(Back Ordered) as we've been waiting months for the basement door lock
covers and knee protector/steering column rubber....
