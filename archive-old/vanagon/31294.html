Hi:

You didn't describe your vehicle, but I can tell you what
happened to my 1988 Westy.

The (aluminum!!!) splined drive lost its splines to the
steel wiper arm - no back and forth, as you say.  So I mosey
into the dealer, expecting a quick (hah), cheap (hah) fix.

&quot;Well, we'll have to remove and reinstall the the dash, 
and the part costs $$$... total ~$500.&quot;

After I picked myself up off the floor, I appealed to
VW of Canada.  They agreed to cover about 75% of the cost
as a &quot;goodwill gesture&quot;.

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; One of my windshield wipers does not go back and
&gt; forth, something is stripped.
&gt; 
&gt; What part do I  replace and is it easy to come by.
&gt; 
&gt; Please respond to me directly,
