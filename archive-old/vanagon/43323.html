Subject: /f Longest Journey in a Westy (Long Post)

&gt;The longest journey in VW Camper was made by Harry B. Coleman and Peggy
&gt;Larson.  They completed 143,716 miles from August 20, 1976 to April 20,
&gt;1978 thrthrough 113 countries.

Then Joel replied:

&gt;aha!!! not so fast, Travel-breath!!! ;)
&gt;
&gt;i've got a book, Im VW-Bus um die Erde, by Wil and Sigrid Tondok, which
&gt;claims 350,000 km in a (highly customized) 1968-1971 VW high-roof camper,
&gt;from 1971 to 1979 (? i can't read enough german to tell for sure).
&gt;that's about 217,000 miles....

Okay, by my calculations, Angel's candidate traveled about 239.52666667
miles per day while Joel's averaged only about 74.315068493 miles per day.
I don't know about the &quot;long trip&quot; designation, since we have list members
who probably average more than 75 mpd commuting. 

My guess is that Joel's candidates had more fun...though I'd have to agree
that Angel's candidates were cranking out the miles.

Now, to add my own statistic:

I have a *friend* with a westy that's been parked in a barn since 1962
with a small stack of firewood in the back.  Unbeknownst to him, a small
screw hole in the roof let a little moisture drip down into the bus, onto
the wood while at the same time a very slight opening in the vent-wing
allowed a sparrow to stop by the wood pile, bringing in a couple of
spores. So, my friend goes out to check on his beloved 1957 westy (reputed
to be the first-ever, experimental westy) and discovers, much to his
chagrin, a small pod of mushrooms emerging from the well-seasoned wood in
the back of his westy. He opens the rear cargo door, and tosses out the
wood, not paying much attention to the mushrooms. 

Right about that time, I arrived to help him start the restoration
...bringing him a vegemite sandwich. Without even thinking, he wolfs it
down straightaway. It was so good that he even licks his hands,
*unwittingly* ingesting a few spores.

As the restoration work begins, he crawls into the westy and begins a
perilous journey through the ether, into the land of sdrawkcab
gnilleps, over the trees of hysteria, on past Jupiter and the land of
knarly bigszwots and back through a hole in the Sea of Japan, logging
roughly 16 million miles in about four hours. ...4 million miles per hour
in a westy.

Of course, when he returned, the westy had somehow been painted with
pretty impressive hemp graphics...and being that Arkansas is a drug free
state, now he can't drive it, even though compression checks out at 124
on all four cylinders and the restoration was somehow completed in the
four hour time span.

My friend indicates that his travels have much enlightened him and he's
thinking of moving himself and his westy to Canada.

Happy Friday ;) Joe
