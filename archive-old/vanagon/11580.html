Subject:      more tidbits from Limbo

just perusing the new Transporter from LiMBO and ran across this stuff ...

&quot;Al has a tent for his Vanagon that attaches to the back hatch. It is made
by Eureka and is called an A.T.V. tent.&quot;
&lt;unfortunately, that's all he says about it!&gt;

a picture of a &quot;unique combo/campers of Bill &amp; Dot from Bus Heaven.&quot;
it's a trailer being pulled by a 74-79 camper. only the trailer is made from
TWO rear-ends of the same age buses! imagine  two rear-ends, welded together,
&quot;face-to-face&quot; as it were. so you have TWO rear hatches to open up. and, yes,
there's still that one big window on each side. :) kinda neat looking.
