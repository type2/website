Subject: Update on Vanagon leaky tank/overflow vent...

Yo,

I took your advice to heart (many thanks to Jack Reed, William R.
Kennedy, Trace Choulat, John Foster, Jack Stafford, Steve Maher,
EdBuzz_at_aol_dot_com, Patrick Eagan, and Unca Joel) and had another, closer,
look at the overflow/expansion tanks and hoses.  Well, as close a look
as you can get with the front end up...it's still pretty &amp;%#_at_ tight! 

Well... the hose linking the left and right overflow tanks looked
a little shiny (as opposed to the grime covering the other hoses) at
the t-junction on the driver's side, and sure enough, it was gasolina.
At least it's not a hole in the tank!

Sigh, now to find the time and energy to fix it.  That has to be one of
the most inaccessible places on the van, unless you happen to possess a
five-year-old's small, flexible, and dextrous limbs!  Maybe I'll just
pay someone to do it and eat peanut butter sammies for a while...

Joachim
