Well, here's the report on my recent brake bleeding adventure.

My record is intact!  BTW That is NOT a good thing.

I still have air somewhere in the lines.

Used a whole large container of Castrol GTLMA.

Spent a long time gravity bleeding, pumping, etc, yada yada, doing 
all the correct things, and still . . . I just may be doing something 
a little goofy  . . . . oh well.

I've learned to live with my limitations.  

Pump one, pump two, NOW I can stop.  It's not quite that bad.

Thanks for all the tricks and tips, tho, I do appreciate the positive 
thoughts.

Bentley states that DOT3 is sufficient for my '80 Vanagon, but it 
can't hurt to use DOT4.

- Jeff
