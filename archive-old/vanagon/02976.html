Subject: Re: new engine from VW

This sounds like a really good deal.  I've been pricing the parts alone,
for what it would take to rebuild my `86 and came up with ~2500.
(This is replacing the pistons and sleeves as well as any other potentially
worn part).  I'm going to followup locally to try &amp; see exactly what &quot;rebuilt
from the factory&quot; entails.  If it includes pistons/liners as well as lifters
push rods, all bearings, etc, then the $2500 would be well spent.  

Maybe VWofA could quantify this for us?  Or Joel, you seem to have a good
relationship with the local dealer.  Do they know, or can they find out
exactly what parts are kept and what's replaced?

 &gt;&gt;I was talking to the parts guy at the local dealership.  He said that VW
 &gt;&gt;has a deal to replace ANY vanagon engine for $2495 complete.  Something to
 &gt;&gt;do with recalls and stuff so they just made a blanket rule.  He also
 &gt;&gt;mentioned that most VW dealerships would try to steer you away from this
 &gt;&gt;option to instead rebuilding your engine because the VW dealership makes
 &gt;&gt;no money on the new engine under this plan due to the way the plan is set up.
 &gt;
 &gt;well, i just phoned in to the dealer in atlanta, and, yup. but it is NOT
 &gt;a 'new' engine.
 &gt;
 &gt;it's a factory rebuilt engine with new heads, and atlanta's price was $2380
 &gt;NOT including labor, which they figured at 10 hours _at_ 52.00/hour. so it looks
 &gt;like a vw dealer rebuilt could be had for right at $3000.
 &gt;
 &gt;oh, yeah. those are the water-cooled engines, by the way. BOTH of them, the
 &gt;1983-85 (DH) 1.9 liter and the 1986-91 (MV) 2.1 liter engines.
