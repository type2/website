&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;well ... it's almost a certainty that you'll need a new dryer. if the system
&gt;&gt;has been opened to the air at all, the dryer is probably wasted. they ain't
&gt;&gt;cheap. but you probably can find one at other-than-the-dealer.

Is there a way to dry it instead of replacing it? What's the material
inside the dryer? How about bake it (low heat of course) in an oven?
