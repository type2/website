Hi folks,

I just received a flyer from RMMW.  There are a few items with large
discounts that would be worth buying now if you've been waiting.  You have
to mention code &quot;Fi3&quot; to get the discount and this sale is only good through
March. RMMW # is 1-800-258-1996.

These are the best deals in the flyer, IMO.  There are some other discounted
items but I think you could get these cheaper if you bought through another
source anyway.  If you place an order of $50 or more the first 500 customers
get a free Bus, Ghia or Cabriolet coffee mug but you have to mention the
discount code &quot;MUG&quot;.  

I just ordered the rear hatch window seal for my 71 (how could I resist it
for only $9.95?).
