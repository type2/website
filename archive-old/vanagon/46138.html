Subject: Beetle Question -- pop-outs price in USA?

Sorry for the non-bus content here. 

My boyfriend is restoring his '59 bug and is looking at getting
pop-outs for it.

We're in the UK and wondering about pop-out prices in the
states to fit this bug. It might be worth his while shipping some
over. 

Does anyone have a rough idea of prices? Or better still does
anyone have a pair they want to get rid of?

BTW, I've just come back from a show where I found a member
of the Splitty club with a spare VW badge to replace my stolen
one :-)

Thanks

Sarah
