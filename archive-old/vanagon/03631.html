&gt; BTW, the last rebuild was necetated because the L head loosened up--the 
&gt; manual says this should'nt happen.  Well I know better now, I guess!?
&gt; BTW  I'm new to this internet thing, so thanks in advance and &quot;see&quot; you 
&gt; later.

The dipstick tube should not be too hot to hold.  IMO the first gauge to get
is oil pressure.  It will tell you more about temp than the other ones...
