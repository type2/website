Subject: Re: East Coast(ers), Particularly DC Metro People




&gt;&gt;This is a follow up note to the proposed gathering of folks in the DC area
&gt;&gt;this Sunday.

&gt;&gt;The meet was (proposed) supposed to happen at the Zoo Bar across from the
&gt;&gt;Nation Zoo in the District.

&gt;&gt;When I arrived, I saw another Vanagon 'Westy' on the street nearby (I was
&gt;&gt;hoping

&gt;&gt;Upon entering the bar, I noted approximately a half-dozen people present. I
&gt;&gt;aske anyone owned the van outside, no response

&gt;&gt;I waited about an hour and concluded the meeting had a total of one person in
&gt;&gt;attendance. Comprising a quorum, I adjourned the meeting and departed.

&gt;&gt;Pete Sellers


Pete: I was there! And so was another listmember, Peter Krogh! He had the Westy
on the street, and I had the Notchback directly across the street from the bar.
When I got there at 6:15pm, I was worried when I small the meager group in the
bar. I asked the bartender if he knew if there were any VW nuts there, and he
looked at me like I was crazy! Luckily, Peter heard me, introduced himself,and
we hung out for a hour and half or so.We were hoping for others, but nobody else
came in. Did you sneak in the back way?  We had a good time ,wish we connected
with you. (Next time, lets all wear a VW hat or something!)

Now, for the second part. I am going to Bug-Out in Manassas, Virginia on May
29th. For those that have never been, it costs $10.00 to get in. The parking lot
is about a 1/2 mile walk to the entrance. I plan on entering my Notchback in the
show. Not that the Notch is show-quality (after all, Al called it &quot;decrepit&quot;),
but it's cheap parking! It only costs $15.00 to enter the show, which includes
one admission. Now, I consider $5.00 to park in the middle of the action well
worth it. I usually bring a Hibachi, a beach umbrella and a cooler of food &amp;
drink. I think I might of convinced Peter to enter his Westy in the show, too.
Does anybody want to hook up down there? Hey, food is expensive there--lets cook
out together! Since Pete got kinda burned on the last one, I will be willing to
take care of logistics on this one.

We have 3 weeks to get it together guys. If we dont, I bet the West Cost people
are going to FLAME us real bad...    :)
