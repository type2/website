Subject: Re: Mexican vehicles --HOW ABOUT SOUTH


&gt;     Since the Vanagon already met Fed safety/crash requirements and the
&gt;Audi 5-cylinder also meets the EPA regs--would it be possible to bring
&gt;these into the US?  Even parts of them would be nice--like a nice new
&gt;rust free, dent free body with a 5-speed tranny.


Garth,

The engine in a SA Vanagon is only a AUDI 5 Cyl. style. It is modified
in some specifications to meet the SA and Vanagon requirements. The
differences you may find in the archives at VW Kombi testreports.
