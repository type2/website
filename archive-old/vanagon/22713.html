Subject: Power discs on Type 2s (Was: Cross-bred cars...)


&gt;I have panicked-stopped a number of times, and the old double shoe
&gt;leading brakes seem to me more than up to the task, even if they are a bit
&gt;out of round.

So have I, in my '69 Bus.

But now that I'm driving my '71 with the power front discs, I'm a spoiled 
child.
They are soooooooo nice...

Try them, you'll like them!
