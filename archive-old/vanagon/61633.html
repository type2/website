&gt;&gt; Removing the float assembly, and leaving it connected to the wiring
&gt;&gt; harness, I ran the float along the rod and the problem was
&gt;&gt; reproduced.  Again, an intermittent problem.  It would run through
&gt;&gt; the various levels correctly, and then sometimes stick on green.
&gt;&gt; I've played with the wires, and everything is tight, and clean.

Then Larry Johnson writes:
&gt;Our '86 Sycro Westy (Canada specs) does not have a float mechanism 
&gt;(that
&gt;I can find). Instead there are four (or is it three?) electrical
&gt;contacts on the side (through from the outside) of the water tank. 
&gt;When
&gt;the water level is such that two contacts are covered, the circuit is
&gt;complete and the sensor light is lit.

&gt;

The float mechanism that Harry Yates described was used in Westys 88-91. 
About $72US from Volkswagen.  Order Part Number 255-070-812.  And you've
really gotta look hard in the Camper film to find it - it just doesn't
jump out at ya.

As to what Larry Johnson described above, Westy's from 80 thru 87 used
the &quot;sender lug&quot; contacts along with an electronic sender box to send the
signal to the LED plate.  Sender Lug PN 253-070-569, Sender Box PN
253-070-568

Hope this helps all :-)
