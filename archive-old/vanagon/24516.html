Subject: re: the guy in Puerto Rico

Martha,
	Give it a break.  Your response reminded me that language is a 
pretty poor medium to do much in, save taking a advantageous position 
over, people, things.  Anything we write is a new experience for the 
rest(context gives us a chance for understanding).  We make the best of 
this.  Try as hard as we wish, so on, big deal.  Let's wait for the big 
rush in Spanish or Finno/what the hell before we respond in sadness in Latin.
