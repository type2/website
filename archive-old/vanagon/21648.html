Subject: RE: &quot;DRY&quot; DOOR LOCKS



&gt;I hate to disagree with Steve, but WD40 also evaporates, leaving
&gt;things dryer (but cleaner) than before. I have a good friend who does
&gt;locks and speedometers. He says that you should NEVER EVER use
&gt;graphite on a speedometer cable.


To each his own, friends-- I just wanted to relate my experiences with
the stuff, and my conclusions. If a WD-40 treated lock ever goes bad
or gums up on me (hasn't happened in 10+ years), maybe I'll have
reason to change my mind. Till then, I'll keep on keepin'on-- and wish
the rest of you the best, with whatever you use!  :^)

BTW, Bob, who's your friend who does speedos? Mine in the '71 bus
used to make strange noises and the needle bounce around, till I gave
it a shot of -  you guessed it - WD-40. It's been fine since, but I
couldn't get a very good shot at the back of it (with cable unplugged),
way up there in the dash above the steering wheel-- it may still be a
candidate for a seasoned and experienced rebuilder.

No, I don't think it was the cable-- the noise seemed o be coming from
inside the gauge itself. And, when I unscrewed the cable from the gauge,
but left it connected to the wheel, all noise stopped, tho the cable
still turned. Drove it this way for a month, with nary a sound. Not
conclusive proof, I know, but a reasonable pointer.
