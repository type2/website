Well I've got this start problem also. I've lived with it for several
years. Because I've never been stranded, I've not got serious about
finding the problem. When it got really bad I replaced the battery but
it was time to replace the battery anyway.

This is the key: When things are warmed up, that stinking starter can't
turn the stinking engine over. Now in every other car I've been in my
experience has been just the opposite. It dont matter how weak the
battery is; if it was able to start the car cold it would always have
an easier time when warm. This is assuming the charging system is ok,
which it is.

I've been told that a bad starter will exhibit this problem but I
have'nt felt like gambling with a couple hundred dollars to find out if
the fellow was right or not. With summer approaching I'll have to
reconsider. I might start with some beefy cables first.

Steve
