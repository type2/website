Subject: print people using our list

What I am saying is that print people who use our list--this is
great--spread the knowledge--keep the great VW van alive by keeping
expertise in the hands of the people and all that.

What I am saying is that any of the print folks who use our stuff should be
required to post like-stuff of similar quality to our list. Benefits
everyone, even themselves, cause it gets them more members, and us more
members and expands the # of people who can deal with the breed, and keeps
more around, and means VW won't discontinue selling various parts so fast, etc.

Reciprocity is the word.

And of course, permission is an easy, simple, effective solution to ask
before reprintting stuff.
