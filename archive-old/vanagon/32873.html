Subject: question about catalytic vs. infrared heaters


Yesterday my work took me to the middle of the state, near Stockton, so I
met listmember Al Knoll midway in Rio Vista, to give back to him the antique
cast-iron cookware he accidentally left behind at our recent camping trip to
Big Sur.  My schedule unfortunately allowed me only a few minutes in Rio
Vista, but I took the opportunity to check out a local antique/2nd hand
store, ever on the look out for camping paraphrenalia.  This store had something
I'd not seen before - an old Coleman catalyic heater, but which worked on
coleman fuel, rather than propane.  When Al appeared, I coerced him into
checking out the unit for me, and he explained that Coleman had made these
and the propane catalyic heaters in abundance in the 60s.  He also said
that the propane heaters burned cleaner, were hotter, and less dirty than
the Coleman fuel ones, so I opted not to buy the unit.

But this brought up some questions I wonder if some of you can answer.  Recently,
I heard these catalyic heaters (especially the propane ones) referred to as
being infrared.  Infrared here was used in the sense of perhaps not TRUE
infrared, but rather a device which warms objects rather than warming the
air.  Then, today, I read something which contradicted that, and instead
called a unit which is NOT catalyic infrared.  Does anyone know the real
answer to this?  Secondly, in either scenario, is infrared or non-infrared
preferrable, and why?  (I know all the about the dangers of using propane
in a confined space, and that it should be externally vented/ducted, etc.

All hints appreciated..
