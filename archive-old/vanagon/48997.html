Subject: Vanagon Cuts Out

Hello Everyone,


I have a 1986 Vanagon GL with AC and automatic trans and a 2.1iter motor.
New motor with 10,000 miles on it.  

This Vanagon has a problem where after about 20 min or so of 60 to 65 mph
driving it will cut out for about 1/2 sec then keep on going with no trouble
for a while (maybe a minute maybe 10 min.)  and then the motor will cut out
again. 

It is very abrupt when it does this. And when the motor restarts again it is
also very violent. This seems to worse the warmer the engine temp.  Although
over the course of my commute 1 hr+  it may do this once or twice or not at all.


I read on the list about wiring harnesses and such but I am not sure this is
hte same problem.  When it happens, the tach. drops very quickly, more
quickly than I would expect,  so I am not sure if I am losing electrical
power to the motor. 
I does not backfire when this happens though.  
  
Also does anyone know the normal operating range as depicted by the gauge in
my van. Do we know what the actual spread in degrees is across the range of
the gauge. If I sit in traffic for awhile I can see the gauge go almost 3/4
of the way across the face, but I have not seen it go any furtheer than that.

I have bled the system and there does not seem to be any air in it.


Thanks folks
