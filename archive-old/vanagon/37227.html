Subject: Syncro Transmissions

     HI all,
 
   This week I was sick as a dog so I had lot's of time to think
   up Questions for the Vanagon Syncro Gurus. OK .. out of all the
   Syncros I've seen (that's not many here in pgh., about 15) more
   than half have had the transmission replaced or repaired. Anyone
   have some reason for these failures? I am planing on using my Syncro
   for some real work: dragging junk car out of the woods, removing
   tree stumps, some towing of stuck cars. Am I looking for
   trouble??   TO all who have a Syncro- did your trans. require work??
