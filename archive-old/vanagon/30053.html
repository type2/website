Subject: Re: Vanagon snow performance

&gt;&gt;Vanagons rule the roads when there is fresh snow!  I get to payback all
&gt;
&gt;Yup, ditto.  When they do slip out sideways it is a bit abrupt, stiffer
suspension and more front weight than the older loafs.  Behaves like a short
wheel base car, ie. recovers quickly too. Up to 10&quot;-12&quot; snow is easy
driving, just keep your speed up and don't stop for anything.
&gt;         Get 4 snowies if you can afford it, two is excellent however,
really excellent!!  Chains are a lot of labour, 30mph max, 1/2 hr install
etc. but you can climb anything then, solid ice included.  A good set of all
seasons, my fave Yokohama Y370 195/75/14 and chains will do you year round,
likely never need the chains. Buy 6-8ply tires if possible, not as critical
in winter, I currently have 4ply snowies on a Syncro, good traction,
sluggish handling/acceleration.
