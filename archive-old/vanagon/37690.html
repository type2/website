&gt; I know it is not friday yet but this is not exactly joke material either
&gt; (although it is hopefully humorous).
&gt; 
&gt; Background:
&gt; 
&gt; About 2 months or so ago when I first joined the list Matt J. and Susie
&gt; (his girlfriend from New Zealand by way of London) sent a message out that
&gt; they would be doing a cross-country trip and could they stop over and meet
&gt; some people along the way.  Well, I was new and eager so I gave him my name
&gt; and number and told him to look me up when he got to Stockton, CA.  Many
&gt; moons went by and I just kinda forgot about it.....
&gt; 
&gt; Present:
&gt; 
&gt; Matty called the night before last as I was trying to wrest the steering
&gt; wheel out of Lazarus (who IS appropriately named) and said he was in town.
&gt; He wanted to get together with us and some of the Sacramento folks if he
&gt; could.  I said great and we just seemed to hit it off so we talked for
&gt; awhile and chatted and we agreed to get together for lunch the next day.
&gt; So the next day I came home and got my wife (she substitute teaches so is
&gt; on call.  thankfully she did not get a call yesterday) and daughter and we
&gt; all went out to lunch.
&gt; 
&gt; We met at their hotel and, of course, I checked out their '70 Westy before
&gt; I actually saw them!  Fun folks.  We all just seemed to hit it right off.
&gt; We managed to get through lunch with a blast and agreed to meet later that
&gt; evening.  Perhaps get up to Sacramento.
&gt; 
&gt; Welllllll  :-)  We never quite made it.  We spent the whole evening just
&gt; having LOADS of fun.  We spent a great deal of time in the bus.  This was a
&gt; little weird considering that we had a cozy, warm house not more than 6
&gt; feet away but we all agreed that it just felt right.  We ordered Chinese
&gt; food and ate it right there on lawn chairs and by the light of his dome
&gt; light and a candle and chatted for hours.
&gt; 
&gt; It started to get cold so we moved it inside and we watched a little bit of
&gt; Ren &amp; Stimpy, we blew Barney to bits on my Mac and continued to drink.
&gt; They found this intriguing little drink called Bullwinkle Soda.  It is a
&gt; ELECTRIC BLUE color and is called a &quot;Vitamin Soda Pop&quot;.  Matt and Suz also
&gt; demonstrated its unique ability as a Vodka mixer.  Oh, I think we accepted
&gt; that ability a LITTLE too much.  I am *STILL* reeling from that!
&gt; 
&gt; So, about 4:45 AM *I* trudged off to bed as I was dying for sleep.  A few
&gt; hours later as I was trying to get ready for work.  I was oh so painfully
&gt; reminded of the nights activities.  Matt and Suz had slept on our sofa bed
&gt; (we really did not want to find our new friends frozen in the morning!
&gt; 
&gt; They are out right now getting a boom box for the Bus.  I am going to wire
&gt; up a cigareete lighter for them in the Bus so they can run an adaptor to
&gt; power the Boom Box when they are driving.  We have both taught each other a
&gt; lot about our Westys and have had a lot of fun.
&gt; 
&gt; I guess this is sort of a &quot;See you too can do this&quot; message.  If you also
&gt; responded as a person for them to see write back!  They are loads of fun
&gt; and a welcome addition to your lives!
&gt; 
&gt; -Marlin
&gt; 
&gt; P.S.  there are lots of little side stories that arose in the last two days
&gt; that I would love to tell but the noise from the keyboard is giving me a
&gt; headache! :-}
