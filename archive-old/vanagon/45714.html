Subject: Re: Strange Bus Sighting

&gt;I was heading West on I70 from Columbus towards Dayton, OH when I got a
&gt;glimpse of a LATE model bus (?!?!?!?!?!???).  It was heading east so I
&gt;only got a quick look.  The bus was a silver colored 'Loaf with a newer
&gt;looking silver Westy roof (Like on my Vanagon).  The kicker...this Loaf
&gt;had what I believe to be a radiator in the front.  A black grill about
&gt;four foot square.  This was not a retrofit add on?  Was this one of the
&gt;Mexico/Brazillian or somewhere else bus?


I too have seen one of these strange beasts.  Stranger still, the interior
reveals it to be a cross between our beloved 70s model and that of the
vanagons (weird looking dash...).  It seems I heard someone somewhere
mention that the grill is an oil cooler, not a radiator...
