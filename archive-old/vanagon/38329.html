&gt;Whats the involvement on replacing lifters.  I not happy with a slight
&gt;tapping sound on cold starts.

Some tapping is normal.  Repalcing the lifters will require removal of the
pushrod tubes.  You will then need two piece tubes which will create leakage
problems.  If you have a bad lifter, only repalce that one unless you need to
remove the head for something else.
