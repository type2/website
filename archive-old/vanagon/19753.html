Subject: Embarassing Moments, etc.

1) Try repeatedly setting the points. Put on the distributor cap. Crank
crank crank crank.  Why doesn't the engine start? Oh. The ROTOR. Yes, we
need that.
This can happen once to anyone (well, me anyway), but after cranking away
the 12th time in a row, my friend and I were laughing too hard to finish the
job (I guess you had to be there).

This was the same car ('73 412) where a red screwdriver dropped down into
the nether regions of the engine. It never reappeared. It's still in there
somewhere, as far as I know.

2) I can laugh about it now, but the engine fire in my '76 Westy (Hal)
wasn't funny at the time. I can tell the full story if anyone's interested
(&quot;hey--does smoke come out of that vent often?&quot;).  (moral: when you buy a VW
that's been sitting for a few years, don't drive it to Florida or other far
places without replacing old fuel lines)
