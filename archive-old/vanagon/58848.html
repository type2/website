Subject: grounded ECU??

Hi Volks,

Recently there was a post about making sure the ecu was grounded. I went
and looked at the ecu on my 83 WB and it appears that the ecu is more like
insulated from the body. There is that plastic housing attached to the
frame. There doesn't appear to be any were to ground it (wires?) Does
anyone know anything about this. Also, is it true that upper control arm
bushings are dealer only? Has anyone changed them? Thanks.

Dave
