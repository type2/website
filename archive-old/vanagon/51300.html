      My '81 Vanagon has developed a problem which I think is fuel injection
related, or at least the ignition seems to be all in good shape. It won't
idle, and turning the idle screw has no effect. Also there seems to be some
misfiring at some points especially in lower rpm ranges. I just went over
the hose fittings, etc. making sure everything was tight, but that actually
seems to have made things worse. 
    Please email me as I read the list on the archives. Thanx.
