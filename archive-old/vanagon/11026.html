Subject: 73 Westy into California...how hard?
Date: Thu, 2 Feb 1995 08:02:56 -0800 (PST)

So Peter Williams says:
&gt; Thanks for the info everyone
&gt; 
&gt; The vehicle in question is a 73 Westy with a  currently non functionning
&gt; air pump and blocked off EGR.
&gt; 
&gt; I am wondering if this is old enough that it predates differences between
&gt; California legislation and 49 state/Canadian legislation.

Well, no the vehicle in question is not old enough.  Most garages you
go to will notice the non-working pump if there is no belt on it.  It
depends on how well-versed the mechanic is and how thorough a job he
does in checking.  There's alot of shops that basically gloss over the
system and if it looks like what's in their book, then that's good
enough for them.  The EGR valve, if it is in place and the blocked
off portion of the pipe is not in plain view, then they probably won't
even look.  Then if you pass the tail pipe emission, you okay.  Again
it depends on the shop.  I certainly wouldn't take it to CSAA.

Cheers!

Steven
