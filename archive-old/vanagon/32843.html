&gt;Has there ever been any consideration giving to splitting up the list in to
a
&gt;couple different list like say one for each of the major models - split
&gt;windshield, Bay window, Vanagon, &amp; Eurovan?  That way an individual could
&gt;sign on to one or all depending on his/her interests.

I keep suggesting (is anyone listening?) that listies just make the subject
of their message explicit to what model(s) of van that the message pertains
to.  Examples: 
&quot;87 Syncro Clutch Problems&quot;
&quot;Splittie Heater Question&quot;
&quot;72 Engine Timing&quot;
This allows everyone to quickly either skip or delete the messages that
they're either not interested in or have no expertise in.

I'm really surprised at the volume of posts that not only don't make a
specific reference in the subject, but also don't bother mentioning it in the
text.  People have to read a while to discern what generation of bus the
writer is even talking about.
