Subject: Re: '87 has noisy lifter

Mark,
        I'm a fairly new owner of an '87 Westy.  The first time it did that
to me, I started driving it immediately to my mechanic.  Then it stopped,
so I turned around, went home and called them instead.  They told me that
this was not uncommon when it sits for awhile and to basically not worry
about it.  It hurts my ears, though, and I have to wonder if its not so
good for the engine.
If anyone else has comments about this, WE would appreciate hearing them.

Kathy


&gt;The 2.1l in my 87 syncro has a noisy lifter. When the vehicle sits for a few
&gt;days (I drive it about every 3 days or so) the lifter ticks for a couple of
&gt;minutes and then quiets down. Today the lifter ticked loudly until the oil
&gt;got up to operating temperature (~180F), then it quieted down like always.
&gt;I'm using Mobil 1 synthetic15W50 oil (and have been for over a year now).
&gt;
&gt;What should/can I do about this?
