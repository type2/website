Subject: Re: Cuttin' a big ole hole in my roof...

&gt;Greetings-
&gt;	
&gt;	Well, I've bitten off quite a huge project.


I've done a '78 over, and simply cut a 4' x 4' hole between the ribs, then 
turned up the edges 90 degrees with a hammer and body dolly (not the 
inflatable type!) This stiffened the edges of the cut-out, and gave a place 
for some vinyl molding to fit on, thus avoiding facial lacerations. I didn't 
mount the hammock (older '72 fittings) as the '78 didn't have the 
strengthened double roof.
        Cutting the roof is cake, figure out the size, then lay down 2&quot; wide 
masking tape in the correct position and drawn your lines ACCURATELY on it. 
Measure often, everywhere, and check that diagonals are same length etc. Cut 
with an cheap electric jigsaw, Sears etc. on slow speed, fine toothed blade.
Cut through the headliner with a utility knife, but leave enough to wrap 
over the edgeas of the cutout and hold down under the vinyl edge, looks 
neat. Or replace ceiling with Westy panelling?
        I don't know how the double bed fitting would go, good luck!   tim s.
