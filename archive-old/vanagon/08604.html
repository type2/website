So Dave Kautz says:
&gt;  excursion up to the exhaust side of cylinder #3. Same thing for the type IV,
&gt;  again, cylinder #3 is furthest forward, farthest from the fan. The cooling
&gt;  air exit is also at the rear, requiring the longest - and least probable -
&gt;  path for the cooling air to take. 
&gt; 
&gt;  Anyone else have some experience or thoughts on this? 
&gt; 

I have to differ with you on the Type IV engine.  On my '74 the fan was smack
dab in the middle attached to the crank shaft.  But then again, I'm not sure
of the air routing/porting in the fan housing.  That would be the only other
obstruction flowing difference between cyl. #1 and #3.  

Am I wrong about this?
