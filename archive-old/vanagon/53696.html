Subject: Re: how engine oil degrades (was: sysnthetic oils)


I'm a firm believer as well.  My SO had a LOCA (loss of cooling accident) and
drove the Van until it almost wouldn't run anymore.  I firmly believe the 
synthetic oil kept the engine lubed enuf so it didn't self destruct.  I had
to replace the thermostat housing and lots of other melted stuff but the
motor still worked.
