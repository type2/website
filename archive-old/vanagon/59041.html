     Gail,
     
     By &quot;contiguously&quot; I mean in one large continuous chunk o' driving.  I 
     run propane 24-7 and the tank lasts the same amount as if you were 
     parked and running propane all the time.  I usually go about two weeks 
     or less running constantly and cooking etc.  Although I always have 
     problems filling the tank because 
     joe_redneck_at_the_nevada_gas_station  has never seen a westy propane 
     tank before.  I can never be sure if it's full or not, or really if 
     any was ever added.
     
     That's a wonderful question for the list:  What is the longest 
     continuous use anyone has gotten out of their propane tank?  This 
     would include running the fridge 24 hours a day as well as cooking two 
     meals or so a day.
     
     I run it on propane for two reasons:  1)  It cools WAY better on gas 
     than DC.  2) I don't have to remember to shut off dc and light the 
     thing when I stop to sleep at night least wise I wake up to a dead 
     battery.
     
     If you haven't used your fridge, yet, you should try and fire it up.  
     I hope you don't have any problems, but if you do, search the 
     archives.  There is a plethora of info on the dometic fridge in there.
     
     Hope that helps.....

About how long does a tank of propane last when you run it while driving 
&quot;contiguously&quot; [not sure what you mean by this]?
     
Also, am wondering why you wouldn't let it run on DC while driving?  I 
haven't used my refrig. yet--1st camping trip is about 3 wks off--and I 
confess that I haven't checked the manual for an answer to this.  It's out 
in my Westi, and I'll check it when i go out there in the am.
     
TIA,
     
Gail
