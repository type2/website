Subject: Buying 88 Vanagon- Anything I should know 1st?

I am contemplating the purchase of an 88 Vanagon. It has 173K miles with
70k miles on a rebuilt engine. The vehicle seems to run well and appears to
have been well-cared for. The selling price is $2,850.00. Seems like a
great deal. Anything I should look out for or inspect closely before my
purchase? 

The idle hunts up and down a bit, but I think that is normal for the German
cars with the oxygen sensors. I had an Audi and a VW Jetta that both did
the same thing. Other than that, it seems fine.

Any suggestions or ideas would be greatly appreciated.
