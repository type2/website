Subject: Re: awnings

Bruce asked:

&gt;         How easy is it to remove that type awning? I've talked with some
&gt; folks who lugged their awning around with them all summer because putting
&gt; it on and taking it off was such a hassle. (I don't recall what kind it
&gt; was.) In a perfect world, I'd only want to have the awning attached to the
&gt; side of the bus when I was going camping or picnicking.
&gt;         Last summer I spotted a rolled-up awning from Carefree of Colorado
&gt; on the side of a Westy in a parking lot. I never got a chance to speak with
&gt; the owner or see it deployed. Anybody have experience with that variety?
&gt;

Bruce - see my earlier message re: Carefee of Colorado &quot;Freedom&quot; awning. I 
can get the model number for any who care.

Installed it myself. Usually slide the awning off and store it seperately in
winter, but I choose to keep it on in summer. It's so small in the case that
it actually looks &quot;neat&quot; there on the side. 3 Bolts hold it in a set of 
runners, but we think one or 2 bolts is quite enough to hold it on. We usually
run with 2 just in case!
