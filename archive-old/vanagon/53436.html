Dave;
If it was me I would try to run up the temperature as much as possible.
Drive it at interstate speeds for about forty minutes, pull off
somewhere safe and let it continue to idle. Open engine access and watch
for bubbles in the expansion chamber. Look under neath for leaks. Try
front and  rear seat heater if it has one. Do you smell anti-freeze?
Check for white smoke. Check the oil dip stick for precence of a white
film. 
Good Luck

&gt;I am contemplating the purchase of an 88 Vanagon. It has 173K miles 
&gt;with
&gt;70k miles on a rebuilt engine. The vehicle seems to run well and 
&gt;appears to
&gt;have been well-cared for. The selling price is $2,850.00. Seems like a
&gt;great deal. Anything I should look out for or inspect closely before 
&gt;my
&gt;purchase? 
&gt;
&gt;The idle hunts up and down a bit, but I think that is normal for the 
&gt;German
&gt;cars with the oxygen sensors. I had an Audi and a VW Jetta that both 
&gt;did
&gt;the same thing. Other than that, it seems fine.
&gt;
&gt;Any suggestions or ideas would be greatly appreciated.
