well, you can add another Eurovan to the list. 

automatic transmision and fuel injection. 

it has ramps right now, but we are looking for a place to get a GOOD lift 
installed. 
there are plenty of CHEAP lifts available, but they break more often 
than a BMW.

we chose it because it had enough head room for wheelchair access 
without cutting the roof out and damageing it's structural integrity. 
the las VW i owned was a '69 van. it was alot of fun, but i seem to get 
alot of experiance at takeing broken engines out and puting rebuilt 
engines in.

i don't fault the design or the quality of the rebuilt engines, i bought 
running engines and rebuilt them myself. it was just that i am used to 
an engine that has alot of torque at low rpm's, and i just couldn't 
break old driveing/shifting habits.

since then i have made a point of owning vehicles that would shift 
themselves, and then played with the the valve bodies that controlled 
shifting.

i started with old caddies and buicks, and worked my way into smaller 
and smaller engines.

now i'm down to an odd number of pistons. it has a strange sound, but it 
runs well.

i'm also about the only person around that dosn't cuss the memory of the 
Qudra-jet carhbarator system. one of the best machines to come out of 
the general motors corp.
