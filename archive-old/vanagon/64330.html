Subject:      Re: Dometic Fridge Woes

&gt; For the past couple of months, I have seen many posts refering to
&gt; the Dometic Fridge, but I have ignored them as I thought they did
&gt; not apply to me.  Apparently they do.
&gt;
&gt; When I first bought my new (to me) Westy, the Fridge worked fine
&gt; on gas.  The only differences, one month and 6500 feet.
&gt;
&gt; See if anyone can diagnose this (please).
&gt;
&gt; I follow the various instructions to light the beast.  When I attempt to
&gt; ignite it (using plunger A), an (small) explosion erupts from the flue
&gt; vent.  At night you can see a blue flash in the vent, but then nothing.
&gt;
&gt; Any suggestions?  Is it posible it's getting to much gas? too little? too
&gt; much O2? to little?  Should I fill the Propane tank? (BTW, the stove
&gt; works fine).  Is a small explosion normal when starting?
&gt;
&gt; Could this be related to the altitude?  I remember seeing some earlier
&gt; posts about a high-altitude kit for the fridge . . .
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,

It seems likely that you're refrigerator burner is due for cleaning.
All Westy/Dometic fridges require periodic burner servicing;  the extended
(semi-) high altitude operation probably just pushed it over the brink.

While I balked at getting into this myself - I ultimately balked even more
at the thought of paying $100+ to an RV serviceplace to do what was
becomming (for me, anyhow) a biennial procedure.  Having done it a couple
of times now, I can assure you that it's a relatively simple operation,
requiring only a couple of hours and no special tools or skills.  A little
care and attention to some minor details is all that is necessary.

The Bentley manual has good instructions for removing the refrigerator
unit from the van.  The camper owner's manual/packet includes a copy of
the Dometic operation and maintenance manual that includes instructions
for cleaning the burner/combustion chamber.  A good overview of fridge
operation, limitations, optimization and troubleshooting and repairs is
available at:

There's also a copy of the Dometic operation manual (jpeg format) for an
'89 vintage refer at:

  http://www.med.umn_dot_edu:8853/misc/archives/Files/Propane-Manuals-89-Westy/

Some of the details may vary from your model, but the basics - and the
combustion chamber procedure - are pretty much the same for all.

I found that, ultimately, the greatest benefit from 'doing-it-yourself'
was not in avoiding the hassle of taking the vehicle to an TV service
place or even saving the $$, but was from developing the knowledge and
confidence to be able to deal with this problem in the future - when
and where there may not be a &quot;qualified&quot; RV mechanic even available!
