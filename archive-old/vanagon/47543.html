Subject: Thank You + Weekender Epilogue

     Thanks to all who responded to my plea for help on non-closing Vanagon 
     floor vents.
     
     In an earlier post about the Weekender option, I omitted that my 
     window sticker indicated a price of $300, which I assume covered:
     
     - The cushion over the engine compartment
     - The hardware that enabled the rear seat back to fold backward, and 
     the rear seat bottom to slide forward.
     
     Our 1981 Vanagon L's rear seat could only fold down without all the 
     additional hardware. I can't remember whether the middle seat back 
     could do the same.
     
     I did recently discover there is a support rod underneath the rear 
     seat in the 1986 (passenger side) which is handy for propping up the 
     rear seat cushion for storage and access to the secondary heat 
     exchanger valve.
