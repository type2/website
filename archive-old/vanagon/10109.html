&gt; But not for too long, Dave! That rusting away gives me that _added_
&gt; incentive to finish that thesis *really* quickly! 18 months top and I'll
&gt; move to Arizona or New-Mexico or similar. Promised! &lt;could also end
&gt; up in Southern France--but the bus stays with me, hear me?! :) &gt;
&gt;

  Not a chance, Sami. Those french border police will never let it in 
  the country with all those english language instruction/warning labels
  in it. And then they'll see all the rust and make you put it in quarantine
  so that it doesn't spread to any Citroens.
