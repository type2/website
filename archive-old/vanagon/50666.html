Chris,

I too took off the door panel to do the job.  One of the speakers was a
little tight but not to the point of pain.  The collar is plastic with 4
tabs sticking out to hold onto the panel.  If you don't want to re-use
the speaker, cut the collar with some wire cutters (that's what I'd
use).  You might also want ot try a little impact with a hammer and
screwdriver, but that might just make it spin more.  Ya know I was just
thinking, why don't you try to hold onto the grill side with one of hose
flat rubber jar opener gizmos.  I kinda reminded me of a pickle jar when
I saw it.
