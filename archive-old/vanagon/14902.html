 Subject: Selling my 1970 VW bus in Maryland

  I have a 1970 VW Bus which would be perfect for summer touring.
  Unfortunately, I will not be around for summer touring.  I have
  a job which will cover pretty much all of the tour.  Figured I'd
  try to sell it to someone who could put it to good use (I also have
  a motorcycle which I will be driving during the summer, so I
  won't need the bus and I hate to see it just sit there).  Anyway,
  here are the specs:
  1970 VW Bus, tan with white roof
  newly rebuilt engine (bought it, didn't rebuild it myself)
      warranty on engine good until October 1995
      1600cc dual port (original was a single port, the upgrade
           in power is noticeable)
      doghouse oil cooler instead of standard (better cooling, doesn't
           have some of the problems the standard oil cooler had)
      Extractor Muffler instead of standard
      Blue Bosch coil (better spark)
      recently completely tuned (easy to do, will show how)
      less than 2,000 miles on new engine
      34 Pict 3 carbureator
           rebuilt (bought it, didn't rebuild it myself)
           specific for 1600cc dual port engine
           electric choke
  transmission in good shape
      all four CV boots replaced last year, CV joints in good shape)
      transmission fluid replaced six months ago
  Shocks less than two years old
  Body
       one rust through in front of back right wheel well
            (planning to fix this weekend)
       dent around front left headlight (was there when I got the bus)
            (planning to try to fix this weekend)
            does not cause problems with headlight
       All glass in windows in good shape (no cracks, seals in good shape)
       some very minor dings (planning to coat and sand this weekend)
  Note:  I am going to do the bodywork necessary (listed above), but I
         am not going to get it painted.   If I got it painted, I would
         probably ask for more money (at least as much as the paint job).
         This way, whoever buys it will have it in the ready-to-paint mode,
         and can decide how to paint it (color schemes, painting place)
         themselves.
  Interior
       clean and in good shape
  Style
       The bus is a passenger bus, not a camper.  The middle seat and the
       back seat do come out but I have them in at the moment.
  Miscellaneous
  Huge collection of spare parts
       box full of extra distributors
       box full of various carbuerators
       two extra, non-working engines
            could be rebuilt
            engine cores usually worth $50 to $100 when trading
       three or four extra rims
       A lot of other extra stuff
  Selling price:  $2,500 (slightly negotiable)
  If interested, please e-mail me at bgold_at_bss2.umd_dot_edu or call me
  at work at (301) 405-4173 or at home a (301) 490-4394.  It is preferable
  to either e-mail me or call me at home.
  Bill
