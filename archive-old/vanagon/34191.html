So M. Grant says:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;  For those that didn't see it, it looked like they just put a couple of  
&gt;  planks across two dugout canoes, rolled their bus onto the planks and 
&gt;  paddled the whole lot across a *large* river to the otherside. Amazing...
&gt; 

Okay, I take this as a challenge.  I say Martha 'Not to be out-done' Rubin
can put together a trip where we can actually traverse the Atlantic Pond to
the UK on pontoons!  Well Martha?  ;)
