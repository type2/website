&gt; &gt;Are they adjustable armrests, or fixed type? (not sure if this makes
&gt; &gt;a difference). My '88 has adjustable armrests, and still has the door
&gt; &gt;arm rests.
&gt; 
&gt; ?? fer real?? my 88 has the adjustable armrests, but NO door arm rests??
&gt; another difference between the Canadian and U.S. models???

Sorry. I'm losing it. No, correction, I lost it long ago.
Mine just has the door handles on the doors... I'm not sure where 
that random thought came from.
I'll blame it on my wife's pregnancy... (works for her)
