Gotta agree with Joel on this one.  I think you're just asking for it
if you basically kissin' a truck ass.  Kinda like following a brick
wall...

&gt;
&gt;&gt;I got around him once (flat out, 83 mph) but he muscled back in again.
&gt;&gt;Why a low profile car bothers with drafting is beyond me.  I wouldn't.

Linda and I had some idiot that was following a truck that was passing
us and moved over and he couldn't seem to wait to pull in front of us
to get behind it again.  Linda was driving at the time and let him in
but he really cut us off.  I would not have been so generous as Linda.
Probably better that she was driving...

&gt;i have a theory about this: i call them &quot;followers&quot;. they can't seem to run
&gt;down the road on their own. they MUST have someone or something to follow.
&gt;they run up behind you and just sit there, following along. now, if they
&gt;caught up to me, that's because they were going faster than me, right? so
&gt;why don't they pass me and go on as they were before?? cause they are just
&gt;looking for someone/something to follow along behind ... so they don't have
&gt;to look waaaaay out in front: they can just keep looking at your bumper or
&gt;taillights at night. go figure. it kinda pisses me off, so i slow down. but
&gt;some of them can't take the hint. i've dropped 10 mph and some of them don't
&gt;even notice at all. so what were they in such a hurry to catch up to me for??

I have these idiots once in a while, but more often, I have their distant
cousins.  The ones that are putzing along and I gain on them and the minute
they realize that they're being over-taken by a VW, they speed up!?!  Now
why the hell do they gotta do that?  They were going their original speed
for a long time for me to catch up in the first place and then &quot;all-of-
a-sudden&quot; they can't stand it that they were being passed by a VW.
Sheesh!  And then after they speed up and are ahead of you for a while,
they gradually slow down to their original speed until they realize that
a VW is passing them again.  What kind of anal retentives do this kind
of driving?!
