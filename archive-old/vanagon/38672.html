Subject: 83 diesel tires...Yes or No.


This is Jim, I'm confused!  Please give me yes or no answers to these 
specific questions.

Can I put 205/70's on my diesel?  Some say sure, some say expect disaster.
I'm confused...yes or no.

Can I use a high load rated tire instead of a &quot;reinforced&quot; tire?

Will it handle okay if I do this?

Does the &quot;s&quot; in 185/75 sr 14 mean sidewall reinforcement.  I don't think 
it does but I've been told it does and it doesn't...I'm confused...a guy 
at a tire store said it stands for standard.

I've got four different kinds of tires on my van right now, a 185 xzx, a 
continental &quot;reinforced&quot; something or other, and two no name crap tires.  
One &quot;good tire is on the back left and the other is no the front right.  
My van drives like s**t.  Help me buy 4 tires that I can run out and put 
on this week.  Name the  brand you like.

Thanks
