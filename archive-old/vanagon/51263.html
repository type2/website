&gt;I'd like to begin a 5-tire rotation on my syncro so that I can get some
&gt;mileage out of my spare. I realize that syncros require identical size tires
&gt;on all four wheels to prevent viscous coupler damage. Is there any risk in
&gt;putting my brand new spare on when the other tires have about 10K miles on
&gt;them?

I don't think so and I sure hope not.  I've just done the same thing on my
van.
