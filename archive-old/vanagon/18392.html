&gt;&gt;  if there is a &quot;statute of limitations&quot; or something like that VW may use
&gt;&gt;  to deny secret warranty coverage in a situation like this. 

I think whenever a car is smogged the mileage of the car is reported to DMV,
correct? Wrong? If so I have enough evidence to prove the low miles of the
westy. Besides, the westy looks completely like a new one. It is not going
to be a problem to convince anyone that it is at 61k original miles. I am
going to let a VW dealer to tear it apart to determine the damage...

Thanks, Dave. VWoA is sending me some forms to me to assist me in asking
them for reparing the westy. BBB in Oakland is also sending me some more
forms to assist me in getting VWoA to repair the westy. I am sure I will
obtain some compensation from VWoA to some degree of satisfaction. I'll
report progress to the list in the future until the task is completed.

Have a great long weekend!
