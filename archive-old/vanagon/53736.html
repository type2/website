&gt; I really feel dumb, but even with the owners manual open and the picture

&gt; instrument cluster in the dashboard panel.  Can someone give me better
&gt; directions and instructions as to how to open.  ALSO there is a little
&gt; &quot;fill spout&quot; with a rubber plug over the top on the firewall of the
&gt; drivers side (I think it was just above the break pedal (auto trans.-no
&gt; clutch). What is this?

Behind the instrument cluster would be a better description of the 
location.  Just reach over the top of the instrument cover to the edge 
near the windshield, feel the edge of the cover and pul up with you 
fingers.  The cover should snap free.  Under the cover you will find the 
sought after reservoir.  I am assumming it is the same as an 85 Vanagon 
here.
