Subject: any Propex heaters fired up?

Is anyone other than Tom basking in the warm glow of a new Propex furnace
yet? Or are you all waiting for summer like me because you don't have a
garage and it's always dark, raining, or too cold to work outside. If you
have installed the furnace, how long did it take?
