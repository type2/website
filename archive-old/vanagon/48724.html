Subject: Re: Towing a Syncro on all 4's

Jim, I based my asumptions on the fact that VW only recommends towing with a
flat bed truck.They make no mention of the ability to tow with all wheels on
the ground in the manual that I can find.I was making the prsumption that the
precaution was noted due to the inability to tow with all 4s on the ground.If
there was no viscous coupling I may have assumed it would be OK. No such
caution against 4 wheel down towing exists in my 84 owners manual.It may be
OK with a syncro, and without ever taking the front 3rd member apart, I can
only draw conclusions from VW warning.I realize it was directed at commercial
drivers, but still dont you think the flat bed advice would pertain to all
others as well?If it works without damage...thats cool...But I&quot;ll tell you I
made a trip from PDX to SD on July 1 w/ my syncro and was planning to tow it
back behind the moving truck, but after seeing the caution in the manual, I
drove it home instead.I would have towed back my 84(as I have done 2 time s
in the past....1100 mi each way...w/o a problem).Im just not too clear on
this aspect of the coupling.It's a pretty expensive lesson if I am
wrong.....BOINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!

Question????How do you guys do the mime in the email(to highlight text in
members email in your response) in aol?I see you guys doing it in response
but havent found the import button,etc. in the compose mail section?Thanks
