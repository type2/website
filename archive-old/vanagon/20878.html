Subject: Update: Difficult Conditions manual

Hello, everyone!

Well after a few false starts, I've finally got the Difficult conditions 
manuals copied, stuffed, addressed, and in the mail.  I was told Canadian 
folks will be getting theirs by the end of next week, and those of you in 
the States will likely be another week again.  This was Canada Post's 
time estimate, however, and I personally wouldn't be surprised if it took 
another week on top of it all just because Canada Post has such an 
efficient mail delivery system.  Thanks to those of you who already fired 
me some money to help cover the (considerable!) cost of copying and 
mailing--it was great to have a bit of money available so I didn't have 
to put ALL the costs on credit card!  

EDUCATIONAL COMPONENT TO THIS POST:
Financial Planning goes like this: 1) need food; 2) no job = no 
money; 3) buy everything on credit, go camping on weekends; 4) find job 
(this will happen, right?  RIGHT?); 5) pay everything off; 6) save 
money; 7) quit job; 8) take another really long trip in VW camper; 
9) see 1). 

Anyhoo, here's the list of people I've sent copies of the Difficult 
Conditions manual to:

Tim Smith
Andrew Burczyk
Matt Bushore
Steven Reilly
Aaron Robinson
Jens-Dominik Muller
Jose Madriz
Dean Dukes
John Huguenard
Ron Lussier
Forrest Minor
Jim Brill
Joe Kyle
Michael Alexander
John Sharpe
Martha Rubin

I also included in each package a photograph of Christa and me at our free 
camping site on the beach at Playa Tecolote, north of Pichiligue (near La 
Paz) in Baja.  There's been talk of seeing the faces behind the names on 
the list recently, so I thought I'd get some reprints done up and put 
them in the packages.  Be sure you don't throw away your envelope without 
finding the photo first.

If I missed anyone wanting a manual the first time around, give me a 
shout and I'll fix you up.  Thanks for everyone's support, as I couldn't 
have pulled this off otherwise.  Next time (when I have a job), I'll be 
able to send people stuff without asking for cost-recovery, and I won't 
come across sounding so cheap.

Happy reading, everyone!

Tobin
