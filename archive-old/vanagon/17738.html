Subject: So you bought bruces busRe: Oh no! Another one!

&gt; Howdy all. Well, as any true bus freak, I was unable to resist the
&gt;calling of my latest project, a '66 Sunroof Deluxe. It is mechanically
&gt;really sound, with mostly new everything. The cosmetics, however, leave
&gt;a bit to be desired. Basically, it was stripped down. No trim, and no
&gt;interior whatsoever. Also, some wonderful person put a lovely sheet of
&gt;plexiglass over the sunroof, but at least I do have the necessary
&gt;hardware to put in the ragtop. The only other bad thing is a nasty
&gt;spare-tire sized dent in the nose, where someone left it in gear, and it
&gt;smacked a wall with the mounted spare tire.
&gt;  Soooooooooo, I guess my first question is, what's the best way to pull
&gt;such a dent? Although the bus came with an extra nose, welding that on
&gt;seems to be a tremendous project, for which I don't think I'm ready. 
&gt;  Anyway, I will be searching for various door handles and latches and
&gt;other hardware as time progresses. Thanks for any and all bodywork words
&gt;of wisdom.

I'll be darned, you bought the bus from bruce. Sounds like he sold you the
whole package, engine and all. (So... poke, poke...how much did you give for
it?)That nose skin is a major  job, would require lotso tools I aint got
laying around to replace it. I did know a guy once that was in a similar
situation though, and this is what he did: Banged out and pulled as much of
the dent as possible (his wasnt quite as bad as yours) then filled that baby
with bondo (I know, sounds crazy). months/years later he banged into a stump
and the bondo popped out!!! 

If I remember correctly (I looked at the bus also) many of the window seals
need replacing (ouch that hurts$$$) but aside from that and the nose s/he
looked pretty good. Ray mentioned that he had bought a welder, but I dont
know if he has a grinder...maybe he could help you out, Im sure you have
already talked to him

Well Im excited for you!!
congrats
