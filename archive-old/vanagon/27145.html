Subject: re:  Recommendation on Slick 50 

Idon't have any experience with the slick 50 engine glop,  but I DO like the
transmission glop.

    When I turned round a corner ina little town in  the mountains of Idaho
and saw a much neglected looking blue barndoor for sale I went nutso.  My
boyfriend and I waited around all day for the owner to show up and made a
deal to come back and get  it.  The bus had been a grain storage shed on a
farm for probably 20 years and reeked of mouse piss.  They had taken all the
stuffing from the front seat and made a nest in he space under the seat. 

   So, two months later  we show up with a set of tires,  an engine, a pile
of tools,  a complete set of brake cylinders and hoses, battery, and a
welding machine to fix the broken throw-out arm on the transmission (on a
split-case you have to take the trans out and apart to replace the arm - this
was not in the program as we had to be back home after the weekend)

     So after 2 1/2 days hard work, no shower or flush toilet,  The beast is
fired up, much to the amazement of the guy we got it from,   and actually
drove, stopped and had lights, semaphores etc. but no wipers.

  anyway, the point is that the transmission was loud and hard to shift.  We
drove it 500 miles home,  switched the 1600 back into the 61,  and put a 36hp
in the 54.   And I changed the trans oil (yum!).   It was pretty gross, even
though we had put new in before we driving it.   It was sitting so long the
gears were really crusty.  So,  I added that slick 50 trans glop to it,   and
it quieted down a lot more than I expected.  Now I could get it into 2nd much
easier,  it wasn't like speed shifting anymore.    Awhile later it suddenly
got quieter again, and shifts like a regular bus now.  I 'm sure the slick 50
stuff helped a lot.    

    I also put it into the trans of Beastie, the 67 camper I dont have
anymore, and it quit rumbling.  :)

and i just changed the gear oil in the 61 and added slick 50 with the new
gear oil.    I think that tranny is on its way out :(  and that's something
i'd like to put off as long as possible.  But hey it only cost $35 and I've
got 18,000 miles so far.

but i guess you dont have to worry about it clogging the oil passages in the
trans as it all churns up with the gears
