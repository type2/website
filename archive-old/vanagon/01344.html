 Hi,

&gt; my ignorance and inexperience.  Um, on that note, are there
&gt; any other owners out there who are terrified of doing things
&gt; to thier vehicles other than change the oil and such for fear
&gt; of screwing it up?

 What you need is a friend who'll help. Virtually any job is easier if
there are two of you to do it. Another handy confidence builder is to 
dismantle a scrap bus- either a junker bought for parts or to get the bits
you want off a junkyard bus. Once you've taken one to bits it's a lot easier
to do your own- and since it's already a junker it doesn't matter if you
screw it up.

Cheers,
        W.
