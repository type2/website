To keep it short:

We were leaving in the bus for 4rth of July weekend. Just got onto 
expressway heading out of town. All the sudden White smoke (not blue or 
blue-whitish - white) filled the rearview mirror. I pulled over at the next 
exit. Revved the engine and a small amount of white smoke came out ( same 
color as from a tailpipe on a cold day.) Now I do have a small oil leak that 
splatters on the ground. Any ideas or suggestions. I just had the head 
gaskets redone 6k ago. Still under warranty though.  Could the oil leak be 
from the oil pump. Any ideas before I go back to my mechanic and slap him 
with a dip stick?
