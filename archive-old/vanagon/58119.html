The same reducing and oxydizing catalysts we use on our car engines can 
be used on lawnmowers and boats.  The price wouldn't be too significant 
if they were produced in mass, and emissions would be down to the 
Ultra-Low level.

&gt; &gt;At the present time Vancouver DOE is trying to decide how to eliminate
&gt; &gt;old lawn mowers, boat and motorcycle engines that are extremely dirty. 
&gt; &gt;Here they are asking people to voluntarily turn in their old machines
&gt; &gt;for newer, less poluting ones.  They especially like push mowers and
&gt; &gt;bicycles. (They started a rebate program here last summer for when you
&gt; &gt;turn your power mower in for a push or electric mower)
&gt;                                         ^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^
&gt; 
&gt;         I tried, the summer before last I went through THREE electric mowers
&gt; trying to keep my yard down and it's less than a quarter acre (at least I
&gt; think that it's less than that (here it is, .23 acre)).  They just don't
&gt; hold up, and all I am doing is nocking down the weeds, I'm not into the
&gt; grass lawn thing.
&gt; 
&gt;         I tend to feel that after the first big gains on auto polution
&gt; (74-76)the further gains have been an example of deminishing returns.  In
&gt; order to reduce over all auto poultion (and yes, I have writen my senators
&gt; on this point) the best way that I see is; basic emissions controls
&gt; (EGR,PCV,Catalitic converters, and unleaded fuel), then take the rest of the
&gt; money (I'm talking GDP allocation here) and put it into light rail and
&gt; bicycle development.  Result, reasonably clean cars driving fewer miles.
&gt; 
&gt;         VW content
&gt; 
&gt;         I am still having trouble with my 82 diesel.  It is not reving up
&gt; under load, ther is air geting into the fuel (Ican see it in the clear line,
&gt; it is most visible when I turn the engine off) I am deting ready to replace
&gt; the line from the tank to the filter, does that sound reasonable?
