Subject:      Re: S&amp;S Headers

I have a set of the S&amp;S headers and muffler system that I got from the Bus
Boys.
I have not had a chance to install them yet, but here is some additonal info
on them.

The header has much less real estate than the stock system, the system runs
from right to left with the collector ending up on the left side. The header
is two-piece and there is a u-tube to connect the header to the catalitic
convertor. The U-tube is missing the sniffer tube that the stock one has - I
don't think it would be too much trouble to have one welded on - but it is a
notable omission.  The header fits together via press fit - (1/2 has the
front two exhaust ports and the 2nd half has the rear two.) It remains to be
seen if these will leak - but the fit seems pretty tight. The muffler is a
simple turbo muffler and tail-pipe that simply bolts to the cat and replaces
the stock exhaust system. My gues is that the headers and turbo muffler are
probably significantly lighter than the stock system.

Anyway, I'm going to have a sniffer port welded on the U-tube, and I had an
old Monza twin chrome tip that I'm going to have welded to the tail pipe,
Once I get that done and install it I'll report back to the group on the
difference. Figured I might as well do a mpg check and acceleration check as
well to see if there is any difference.

If anyone is interested, I can take a photo of the system and post it on my
web page.
