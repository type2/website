Subject: Cheapest Mail-order Dealer?

Who is the cheapest (discounts for list members etc.) VW dealer who is
doing mail order these days?  I'm desperately in need of some dealer only
parts.

Please respond via my alernate address: stirling_at_aol_dot_com ( I have too many
messages pending on my server, and it would take me a week to sort through
them).

Thanks,

James
