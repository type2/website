&gt; It seems to me, not that we need any more traffic, that someone should

And all the Bug and Ghia folks because they share the same engine as 
195?s-1971.  And don't forget Dune buggies and kit cars.  

I don't think so, join thier list.  I have a hard enough time keeping up 
with the VW lists.

Aren't you the Derek Drew that was complaing about excessive traffic when 
you were on AOL?
