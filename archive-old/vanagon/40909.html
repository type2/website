&gt;There seems to be some question about whether bullets existed in the
&gt;1961 model year.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone else?   :^)

Bullet turn signals ended at the end of the 1961 model year for the 
US market.

I have seen *several* 1962-63 buses with bullet turn signals and the 
large plastic brake lenses.  I always assumed they were European 
market models, not hacks.
