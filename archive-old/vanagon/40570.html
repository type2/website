Hello,

B4 I moved to Montana (&quot;a very indicting place&quot; or &quot;the last best =
place..to hide&quot;), I lived in Memphis.  As far as the oppurtunites for =
bus fanatics goes...Memphis is not the place to be.  I spent 16 months =
looking for a reliable vehicle and ended up buying it in St. Louis, MO.  =
There used to be two VW dealers in Memphis...now only one.   I asked =
about purchasing a new Eurovan at the remaining dealership...they showed =
me brochures and asked if I'd like to order from the catalog.  They had =
no plans in buying one for their lot.

Moon Bugs is in a terrible part of town.  I know, I used to live nearby. =
  Midtown is a great place to live...just not near his shop.  He seemed =
to restore bugs only.  The vans for sale always had oversprayed paint =
and were very poor in general.  If you needed a VW mechanic, his name =
usually didn't come up.  You are also on a street that has about 9 other =
body shops and fender bender repair shops located within view (as well =
as some interesting &quot;book stores&quot; you may peruse while waiting for your =
car to be repaired.)

My two cents,
