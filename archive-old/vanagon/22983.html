                   Home is Where Your Stuff Is

                                
There's a gal on the Vintage VW list who calls her bug 'Boris.' 
I mentioned Boris at dinner one night then had to explain, or try
to explain, that a lot of Volkswagen owners give their bugs and
buses names.  My wife gave me one of those looks, quietly asked
what I called my bus.  Blank.  To me, it's just the Green Bus. 
Before, there was a Brown Bus, before that a Red &amp; White bus.  I
said I didn't give names to things.  &quot;But you called your
airplane 'The Spirit of Vista',&quot; she pointed out.  But never flew
it to Paris. &quot;If I ever put wings on the bus,&quot; I told her, &quot;I'll
give it a name.&quot;  And muttered something about doing it just as
soon as pigs could fly.  That cracked her up.  It also named the
bus. &quot;The Flying Pig?&quot; she laughed. 

&quot;I couldn't do that,&quot; I muttered.  I used to have a buddy who was
a cop, spent umpteen years building a helicopter.  Called it The
Flying Pig.  Flipped it during a test flight and burned to death. 
I wouldn't want to steal his thunder.  But maybe El Puerco
Volador?  Is that right?  I'm always getting my Spanish mixed up.

A ham radio buddy came over after supper.  He's got some strange
plumbing problems.  Only way to fix it is to make an adaptor that
will allow old thin-wall ABS pipe to mate with new schedule 40
PVC pipe, but no one carries the adaptors.  So we made some. 
Turned them up on the lathe.  Took only a few minutes.  Lathes
are handy things and mine's fully automatic.  Just grab the knobs
and think about something else while the parts sort of make
themselves.  I was thinking about Flying Pigs.

While I'm working, my buddy is looking around the shop.  There's
an airplane engine under a bench, two fully dressed Volkswagen
engines on scooters, a Datsun engine sulking over in the corner
beside an orphaned 2-cylinder air-cooled DIESEL engine that might
one day power something strange and noisy.  Above the diesel
hangs a row of heater boxes.

My buddy looks at the five Volkswagen heat exchangers hanging in
a row.  Five.  An engine needs two, a lefty and a righty.  So how
the hell did I manage to end up with FIVE heat exchangers?  I
never noticed that before.  All new, too.

Six blower housings.  Three dog-house, three flat-backs.  One of
the dog-house housings is an after-market 36-hp style that proved
it couldn't flow as much air as stock, ended up not being used. 
I've no idea how the others came to be in the shop.  You leave
the door open, stuff wanders in.  My hands make another adaptor
and my buddy hunkers down, peering under a bench.

Three 12v alternators, two Motorolas, one Bosch.  Two 12v
generators.  A whole scad of 6v generators.  Why do I keep that
crap?  Blowers.  I had a nifty idea for using old blowers to
make...  I'll think of it in a minute.

A whole bunch of intake manifolds.  Oops!  Make that a bunch and
a half; couple more of them hanging over there.  Dual-ports and
single ports, several of each.  DP Kadron bases.  SP Kadron
bases.  That makes... at least TWO bunches.  And carbs.  Lotsa
carbs.  Box of Kadron carbs.  Box of Solex carbs.  Whole big
drawerful of other carbs including a lonely Bug Spray.  Future
projects, waiting for... the future, I guess.

Mufflers.  Yea gawds have I got mufflers!  Four stock bug
mufflers, at least that many extractors.  It's hard to tell with
extractors.  You toss them in a pile, they start squirming
around, get all tangled together, you gotta spray them with a
hose, beat them apart with a stick.

Black, greasy thing under a bench.  My buddy gives me a look,
brows raised.  &quot;Tranny,&quot; I tell him.  Two more, back in there
some place, along with a pile of axles.  One of the trannys is a
rebuilt, ready to run.  I've been planning to install it in the
'67.  I better make a note to myself to get to it Real Soon Now.

Cylinder heads.  Pile of them here, row of them there, two on
that bench, pile over beside the grinder, couple over by the
welding rig.  The bench where I do head work has got this big box
of valves, another box of fuel pumps, some old, some new. 
Shelves hold rebuild kits for carbs and pumps and generator
brushes and wheel cylinders and a whole slather of reloading
equipment for half a dozen different calibers.  The reloading
stuff should be over on another bench but that one's being used
to test a six inch mirror for a reflecting telescope.  

Stack of flywheels over by the milling machine, right beside a
stack of stock, original, real VW-type Volkswagen hub caps for an
early bus.  Should be four.  I count them twice.  There are four. 
I feel relieved, give those five heat exchangers a glance.  Still
five of them.

Bus steering gear and steering wheel shaft leaning up in the
corner behind the welding machine, like its waiting for a ride,
which I suppose in a way it is.

Overhead, running pretty much the full width of the twenty-two
foot wide shop is a pair of airplane wings.  Volkswagen engine
tin-ware is poked up on top of the wings, the smaller pieces
hanging down on hooked hunks of welding rod, handy to get at.  A
stack of sump plates like little Frisbees.  Funny gaskets.  Sez
'GMC manifold.'  There's an old Jimmy down in the grove.  My
hands finish another coupler as my buddy gazes at stuff hanging
on a wire.  

&quot;VW air-vanes,&quot; I tell him.  &quot;Goes inside those things over
there.&quot;   Two sets of air vanes, one reconditioned, painted with
gray epoxy primer, others looking like something out of the La
Brea Tar Pits, which tells me they came out of an all-original
1963, never-been-touched engine I recently overhauled.  The thing
blew an oil cooler seal, pumped oil all over for about six months
before the guy sold it to a kid.  They were both happy as clams,
each sure they'd gotten the best of the deal.

I finished making the adaptors for my friend, chatted a while. 
&quot;You've got a lot of stuff,&quot; he said as I saw him on his way. 
Strong note of admiration, tinged with something else.  Relief? 
Envy?  Is it every man's dream to have lots of stuff?

I came back to the shop to wipe down the lathe, cover it, sweep
down.  Seeing the shop through my buddy's eyes was a strange
experience, like when he stood reading the note on the chalkboard
over where the phone used to be &quot;Pullen - Concrete&quot;, a reminder
about helping Clint Pullen do a little sidewalk out behind his
house so his wife's wheelchair wouldn't get caught on the stones. 
Clint's been dead at least five years.  After I moved the phone,
I never used the chalkboard again.  We did the sidewalk for Alice
back in 1977.  

I sat looking at the incredible collection of stuff that has
crept up on me over the years, looking at it with mixed emotions. 
Too much stuff is bad for you, nails you down.  But my formative
years were during World War II, when everything was rationed, you
even had to stand in line to buy food.  

I was taught that throwing away Good Stuff was a sin.  We needed
all that Stuff to Remember Pearl Harbor, so we could Slap the Jap
and Heel the Hun.  They made us chant slogans like that in
school, then sent us out to scour the neighborhood for scrap
metal, knocking on doors, brow-beat old ladies into giving up
their aluminum pans.  

Have you ever tried to make steel?  It's not easy.  Better to
keep some on hand in case you need it, like that pile of tubing,
or those old door panels.  You never know when you're liable to
need a door panel for a... whatever the hell it came off of.  And
an old veedub axel makes a fine gun barrel.  Remember Pearl
Harbor.  And Ruby Ridge.

I sat thinking a little too long, started going a little crazy. 
Bus right outside, pair of airplane wings strapped up across the
ceiling of the shop.  Five heat exchangers hanging in a row.

El Puerco Volador.  Maybe I could use one of them door panels for
the rudder.
