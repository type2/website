&gt; Volks Folks,
&gt; 
&gt; When we purchased our Vanagon a few months ago noticed how the passenger side
&gt; mirror would slowly head south.  It keeps its adjustment about the X &amp; Y axis
&gt; but loses altitude on the Z axis.  Every couple hundred miles you have to get
&gt; out and pull the mirror back from its drooping position.  The drivers side
&gt; mirror is another story.  On a trip to Colorado we noticed that the mirror
&gt; doubles as a 75 mph indicator.  When you hit 75mph the mirror folds back
&gt; against the door.
&gt; 
&gt; We could live with these annoyances except for the fact that our 75mph
&gt; indicator has become a 70mph indicator.  I think it is time to do something
&gt; before it becomes a 50mph indicator.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, if anyone out there has any sugesstions on how to fix these mirrors
&gt; -or- if anyone has a pair of Vanagon electric mirrors with all the controls,
&gt; please drop me a line and let me know.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Dan
       Dan, REad YOur manual. At 75 MPH they are designed to fold 
            back, for high speed driving! Wait to see what happens
            at 100 MPH!
                             Sorry I thought it was Friday

     Remove 2 base screws, remove 10 mm nut in center, clean grease
     all parts, reinstall.
