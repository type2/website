&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There's a little fish-taco restaraunt here in Sac that has a side of a '66
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; camper mounted on the wall, complete with 1/2 of a safari window and 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1/2 of a surfboard.  This place is the watering hole for the local SOTO guys.

&gt; &gt; &gt; How about a meeting of Lenti folks there in July?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Sounds good to me!
&gt; 
&gt; I'm in!  And Bradley can bring the rest of that unburned case too! ;)

Sorry Steve... I let Al Knoll have the last half case.  I think we 
should let Thom arrange the get together, since he brought it up.  :)
