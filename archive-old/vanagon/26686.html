&gt;So my question to all you knowledgable Syncrometers - How does the 
&gt;Syncro handle in Snow/Ice Winter conditions?


Well from my experience with my syncro it's a whole lot better than the 1988
Toyota 4X4 pickup I had.  This thing is incredible and has had no problem in
the New England winters.  I've driven mine in several serere Vermont snow
storms in the mountains and it had no problems going through 24 inches of
snow.  It's by far the best vehicle I've ever had for winter conditions.
