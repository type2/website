dan:
judging from your recent experience, what degree of involvement do you
think it would  take to install westy stuff in a non-westy vanagon.  by this
i mean what new bolt holes, brackets, holes, connections etc. would
need to be drilled, fabricated, cut, made, installed, etc.  i'm thinking of
doing this in the near future and am wondering what i may be getting
myself into.  thanks very much.
