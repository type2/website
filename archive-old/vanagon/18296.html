Subject:       Wild Problem on '57! CONTINUED!


&gt;  Mike White has a unintended steering problem:
&gt; 
&gt;  Are the reduction gear cases loose where they connect to the spring plates?
&gt;  They used to loosen up on my '64 and gave the power on / power off response
&gt;  you described.

Well, I got under there last night, and checked all of the bolts.  
The swing arm is attached to the frame fine, and the gear reduction 
box is securely attached to the swing arm.

I did notice gear-oil leaking from the gasket where the reduction box 
attaches to the swing arm.  I figure something internally is wrong, 
as it has never leaked before, and there was a 1&quot; puddle of gear oil 
in the driveway.

* Any ideas about what would fail internally?

I have the bus parked for the time being...  &lt;sniffle&gt;



P.S.  You all should have seen the ragtop when three of the hoops 
came out of the track on the freeway!  Talk about winning the 
Americas cup in my bus!
