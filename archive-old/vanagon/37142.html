Subject: RE: Cheap VW Dealer parts?


&gt;Aside from my delight at finding one, I was surprised to find something
&gt;related to the Vanagon other than the list stickers  that cost $10 or less.

The little plastic clips that hold the parking brake cables to the bottoms
of the rear A-arms, go for $1.75 a pop. 'Course, the new ones the VW
dealer has, aren't as good as the originals.   :-/
