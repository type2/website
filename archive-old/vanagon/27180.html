Subject: Re: Color sanding? good/bad?

&gt;Color sanding with 600grit?  The very least you should use on any acrylic
&gt;product is 1200, 1500 is better.  You will NEVER buff out the scratches
&gt;created with 600 or even 1000 grit.  Also you MUST use water when using
&gt;1200 or 1500 grit.  As a matter of fact I have had trouble removing 1200
&gt;gt scratches from clear coats. 
&gt;Just a thought.

HPBook has a book called Paint &amp; Body handbook. In the book it suggests 
using #600 or #1000 grit for color sanding but you think this is not fine
enough...I'd rather use extra fine than scratch the surface. Thanks.
