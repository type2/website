From: Gerald Skerbitz &lt;gsker_at_lenti&gt;
Subject: List policy

Due to the number of people on the list and the variety of machines 
represented, and the confusion about who's an expert on what, I'd like to 
recommend a standard for signatures.
1. Please include your email address in your signature
2. Please include Year and Model of the bus you are driving/fixing/parking

Thanks for your help.  I know a lot of people will appreciate this. 

(Yeah, I know some people don't have one and some have 15; deal with it
eh?  Just try to make it easier for the reader to decide whether the
advice is relevant.)
