Subject: Re: Kombi v. Microbus


John Croteau querries:

&gt; What were the differences between the Typ 221...and the Type 231 (kombi)?
It seems like a lot of people get the two confused and mixed up quite a bit.]



Not many people here get it mixed up...especially arter all of the discussions
that have gone on around here...but seeing as how YOU seem to be mixed
up here's the major definition of a KOMBI.


A KOMBI is the base line passenger version of the Typ2. The major features
are plain painted pressboard wall and ceiling panels and basic seats and
seat covers. In the T1 version there were three windows on each
side of the van...

Basically the KOMBI (or KOMBInation) is an attempt to have a vehicle
that can be a work vehicle during the week (without the seats) and
a family vehicle on the weekend when the seats are put back in.


As I posted two weeks ago...the KOMBI is alive and well in the T4
family....in fact one can get a 10+ passenger version of the T4 Kombi.


If you want more Kombi info, look into the vanagon archives...
