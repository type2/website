Subject: Re: Rolled Westy

&gt;After crawling along for a mile or so I came upon the accident, and
&gt;horror of horrors, it was a late model westy, lying on it's side across
&gt;the two fast lanes.  No clue as to how it got that way, but it appeared
&gt;the driver was unhurt, if it was the lady I saw talking to the highway
&gt;patrolman at the scene.  Chalk another no-injury accident up to the VW
&gt;engineers...

...but, did they stand it back up and let her drive home?

(My brother did that with his '66 Kombi - fell over on the right side...)
