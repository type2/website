&gt;I don't know what the purpose is but I strongly suspect that they add a great
&gt;deal to the structural integrity of the bus.  If you look at them closely
&gt;they're welded in and have what looks like a major support bar running along
&gt;the top of them.

That's what I fear, too. Although, conceivably, it could be replaced by a
less obstrusive form of support, no?

&gt;I installed custom reclining seats in Bobo but was afraid to remove the

Bobo? That's very cute. Kind of reminds me of Montgomery Burn's teddy bear
in one of the Simpsons' episode. So, where did you find those seats? Were
they expensive. I looked at some catalogs, but they were expensive, like
$250 each. Maybe I'll try to find myself those heated Volvo seats someone
else had mentioned a few weeks ago. (Saab probably has them too, and IF I
remember well, the recline is thiner than average and so the seat would fit
more easily.)
