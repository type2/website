Subject: Stupid Electrical error

I installed a new radio/cassette yesterday, and in my ignorance, I ended 
up crossing the brown wire supplying variable voltage to the dash lights 
with a questionable wire colored grey and blue.  Everything went fine 
until I turned on the headlights and the dash lights were dark.  So I 
turned the dash brightness adjustment, and the dash lit for a half 
a second, and then all the dash lights went dark. I've since corrected the 
error, but I've broken something.  The dash lights that are connected to 
the printed circuit foil don't work, but the one connected to the heating 
controls works.  The alternator light and the turn signal light don't 
work.  Can anyone tell me if there are any fuses in that foil, or if I'm 
going to have to replace the foil or if there's a possibility that I 
fried one of the resistors and are they replaceable?
No big fuses are blown.

Thanks for some clues!
Oh. By the way, I won't be going up north because I'll have to work on 
this.

Later,
