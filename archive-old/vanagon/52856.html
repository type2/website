Subject: party for Dakhlia's! 12/28 (Calif.)


Time for our annual west coast December meeting with Sami Dakhlia and
his family, who'll be out visiting a this time.  Oldies on the list(s)
may remember that our meet with them for pizza a few years back was
the very first gathering of members of the then small van/bus list.  Now
that they'll be out visiting again, it seems like a wonderful idea to
repeat the event.  

Anyway, I've spoken to Sami and Maria via e-mail and it's decided that
it would work nicely to have a party at my house on Dec. 28th, at
6 p.m.  Anyone needing to camp for the night is very welcome.  Feel
free to bring kids.  We can race busses out on the street during lulls.  :)

RSVP, and I'll shoot you directions on how to get here.
