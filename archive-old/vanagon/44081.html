Subject: vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu

I have been the very proud owner of a few westys, yet after =

encountering enough troble on a limited budget I gave up on them and =

opted for the SUV that is now my nightmare....I have had a 74, 76 and =

73 westy ( along with a thing, a squareback, ghia and a 66 bus).  Now =

I have the $ to keep up with a single quality machine and I am =

interested in becoming close to a vanagon westy.  As I am new to this =

forum, I am not sure my intuition is correct---can I assume that a =

vanagon would have more power?(on those mountainsides)  Less =

overheating problems?  and generally a more reliable demeanor than my =

previous air coolers?  I am now debating between sticking with what I =

know (and have worked on repeatedly) by getting a 78 westy(beautiful, =

cheap and solid) or any number of the early 80's models I've seen =

available (for reliability's sake)  Is there a difference in the =

availability of parts?---Just wondering what you would all have to =

offer---thanks.
