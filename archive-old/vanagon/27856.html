Subject: Re: ATF the wonder drug


&gt;   On a related subject for the person experiencing lifter noise,
&gt;Stephens Machining told me ATF in the oil is excellent lifter cleaner.
&gt;Unfortunately I don't recall the suggested mix there either.  Of course
&gt;on dissasemble my noisy lifters were not dirty whatsoever, just
&gt;apparently too worn.  Will hold pressure on the bench with cold oil,
&gt;bleed down when oil hot.

Hyd folks,

I remember a post awhile back where a local mechanic _replaced_ the engine
oil with ATF in order to cure lifter blues.  The engine was run for, I
think, a day like that and then regular oil returned.  The post described
success.

Eug,
who does not know about hydraulic lifters.
