&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm looking for someone to say &quot;I've got a 009 on my bus, and it's been
&gt; &gt; &gt; fine for X years =)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; How about this:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 	&quot; I had an 009 on my bus for several years, and never *could* get
&gt; &gt; it to run right.&quot;
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm sure there is a source out there for a stock replacement distributor.
&gt; &gt; Find it, buy it, and be happy.  :)  If nowhere else, call Vee Parts here
&gt; &gt; in San Diego at (619) 477-4787.  They should be able to help.  I would
&gt; &gt; recommend avoiding the 009.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; Interesting, as I have run a 009 on my '67, which has a 68 Beetle
&gt; engine, for at least 4000 miles, and it's been great. I put it on at the
&gt; beginning of this year, and if it's as bad as some are saying, I'd love
&gt; to get an old one- I'd be flying! :)
&gt; Anyway, no complaints here.

I do have an 009 distributor in a 69 dual carbed 1600 cc engine and have
had it for ten years and it runs well. The only related item that I have
replaced over the years is a coil (this year) and of course plugs....DC --
