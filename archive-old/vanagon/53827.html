Subject: Syncro Convention - Again!

Syncronauts &amp; Vanatics,

Yes - It happened again.  Three Syncros in one parking lot!!
This time by plan though.  While on the way home from Spokane Washington I
arranged to meet listmembers Todd &amp; Becky Francis  and  John Becker at a
pizza place in Portland Oregon.  Having traveled 117 miles out of the way (of
my 1352 miles home) to see them, I was not dissappointed.  We had a nice
conversation over pizza and then went out to check out the Syncros.  John had
brought his 87 GL Syncro with a SUNROOF and Todd &amp; Becky drove their 91
TRISTAR.  

After about an hour or so of Syncro snooping, rain (does it ever go for more
than an hout without rain in Portland?) called our visit to a close.

I WANT a Tristar!  I WANT a sunroof!  I want to keep my A/C!!
I had a great time meeting some very nice listmembers and their Syncros!

Oddly enough, their was an REI store that shared a distant portion of this
same parking lot.   Another example of that cosmic REI - Syncro connection.

Regards,
Jim Davis
87 GL Syncro
88 GL Wolfsburg
