If it's anything like my diesel rabbits, then the line you're talking =
about with the
two banjo fittings is on the pull side of the pump, not the pressure =
side.  Maybe I'm confused.  But I've had the little plastic line crack =
in the way you mention before.  I just replace it with 1/4 inch fuel =
line hose and clamp the ends.  You could also have a piece of AN4 or AN6 =
line made up at a local shop with the banjo fittings (We have a local =
place called EVCO which can do this)
