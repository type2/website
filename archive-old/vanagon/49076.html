 Has anyone seen/heard of a vanagon compatible radiator with a cap up front
 like a 'real' car??  Our vanagons are all getting old and replacement rads
 will be in demand soon in larger numbers. The majority of cooling problems
 in vanagons would disappear if we check the level of coolant in the rad, no
 hidden airbubbles, no friggin' bleeding.  Just 4 screws to twist out and
 remove the grill, then the cap.  Still not as good as a car, but way better
 than a vanagon.  Perhaps a little trap door in the grill even! Kennedy
 Engineered Products uses a front fill rad in their Subaru test van, an '85.
 What about the Mexi or Brasil watercooled busses?  Put your ears on,
 complain loudly to radiator sales folks, let's get a very simple
 modification suggested to the right people.  Just wishing.  Tim Smith

Sounds like a good idea, however, let's be realistic.  Air in the cooling
system is only a problem when something is wrong.  If everything is in good
shape, especially the head to cylinder seals, the system as desinged bleeds
very easily.  I never have to do the front raise lower thing and I have no
problem bleeding the system.  Usually in 15 minutes or less.  The 2.1l
cooling systems bleed real easy.  If air in the system is a recurring
problem,  the real fix is to find the cause.  A top mounted radiator cap will
not solve anything if combustion gasses are getting into the cooling system.
