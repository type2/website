To All:

Wanna keep your battery from flying all over the place when you hit the
unpaved stretch between San Felipe and LA Bay Junction?

Use shock cords.  

Forget those metal frame thingees.  Even the best of them eventually
corrodes.  Shock cords are cheap and you've always got a couple or you can
borrow one, asked or or not,  or even lash the puppy down with rope if the
shock cord breaks.  Use two.  It's rare to have them both break at the same
time.

Your battery should be sitting in a shallow neoprene tray with its own drain.
 If you don't have one, pick one up at a junk yard; look in a Datsun.  The
tray is big enough to hold a Type 27 battery.  This is also the quick -- and
permanent -- fix for rusty bug-belly (after replacing the pan, please).

Can't find the neoprene tray?  So make one.  Outta wood.  Pine and plywood
work fine.  To seal it, heat up some common canning wax in a double boiler
and just paint it on.  Stick the bush in it the wax when you're done; it'll
be there the next time you need it.  And even if you've got a neoprene tray,
paint a coat of wax on the bottom.  On the OUTSIDE bottom.  (I'll tell ya why
in a minute.)

Battery acid doesn't make much headway against wax, nor against wood.  If you
assemble the wooden tray without nails (use Weldwood Plastic Resin glue, not
that cheap crap in the bottle) there won't be anything to react with the
acid, even should the wax get rubbed off.  Don't like bare wood?  So paint
it.  Or give it nine hand-rubbed coats of urethane varnish (almost as good as
wax at defeating acid).  And THEN give it a coat of wax.  (Trust me; wax is
the stuff to use here.)

And while you won't believe it, the waxed tray won't slip around on you,
assuming you've got a couple of bungee cords holding it down.  (I won't tell
you how I came up with the idea of waxing my battery box, but if you're ever
at Ponto I'm the old guy with the hand-carved board.)  
To give the bungee cords a place to grab a-hold, I made up some little
fittings out of sheet metal, riveted them to the chassis.  An aircraft
eye-bolt would have been sexier but I didn't have any short ones.  Whatever
you use, give them a coat of wax after you paint them.

Every couple of years, scrape the wax off and lay on another coat.  The only
other stuff that works as well is pure asphaltium, and it's messy as hell.
