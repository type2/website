Subject: Should I trash the Quaker State oil?

I recently ran up on a deal and picked up a case of  Q.S. 10W30 
Synthetic Blend for 4X4's.  I think it was 75cents a quart so I 
grabbed some up thinking, just maybe, it might be all right to use in
my Vanagon.  After the lengthy discussion 3 or 4 months ago about
oils, I tried to remember what was said about the different synthetic
blends, but don't remember the Q.S. ever being mentioned.  I have
ALWAYS used Castrol in my VW's and am willing to give this oil to my
brother for his Ranger but since this stuff is usually rather
expensive, I was hoping I could use this at my next oil change IF it
wouldn't hurt my engine.

Thanks,
Juli
