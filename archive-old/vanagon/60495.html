Subject: Re: shifter problems

thanks joel,
 I have one of the new shifter plates and there are elongated holes for
adjustments. This plate replaces the older plates that had the adjusting
holes you had to align. According to the book you turn the plate all the
way to one side or the other. I have gone both ways and even turned the
plate 180 degrees, hoping that even going from one extreme to the other
I can see which way to go. I also have done that on the clamping
adjustment gone from one extreme to another (shorten and pulled apart).
Its driving me batty. every day I think I know of a better way or am
going to give it another try, and end up frustrated. I can make those
adjustments pretty easily now since I have done it so many times. The
shifter stop fingers are hitting the passenger side of the box before it
goes into 1st I can push down and get into second, but not reverse.
