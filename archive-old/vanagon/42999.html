&gt;   That's a nice description of a procedure to replace instrument bulbs
&gt;Colin,
&gt;but it seems like an incredible amount of hassle to replace a bulb that I
was
&gt;able to purchase at a VW dealer 2 years ago at US$3.80 apiece.  How much do
&gt;they want now?  

The light for the disital clock on the '87 Syncro went out last month, so I
bought another.
At 16:39 hours on 22 April 1996 at Rudy Luther's Burnsville Volkswagen,
Burnsville, Minnesota the price was an astounding amount of $2.22!  (I almost
always keep the receipts.)  The VW part number is 0177262.  That does seem
like a LOT of work for $2.22!
