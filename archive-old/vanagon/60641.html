Subject: CIS Fuel injection on Vanagon

     TO ALL:::::

     Someone on the list had a Vanagon with a CIS Fuel system.
     This is a mechanical fuel injection that was used on
     many older VW's. Could that person please E-mail me. I am
     going to make this change and would like more info.
     
                      Thanks Joe Wagner
