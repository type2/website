Hi,

Roof vent works well.....

so does opening the rear hatch wide....
 Nice idea here would be to get a shower curtain with the little magnets
in the bottom hem and invert it to hold on around the hatch perimeter if
the wind is blowing too hard, maybe shorten the curtain to 4 feet high.
Ugly you say? well...

What about manufacturing an adapter piece of metal/plexi/wood to take an
older Westy louvre?  Use vanagon rubber to hold/seal in the adapter then
the old louvres are just screwed in place easily. I think the old ones
were smaller than vanagon cutout, anyone?  Likely the Reimo catalog has
louvred vanagon windows for a steep price.

fianl Q?  yes, Winnebago has reintroduced the triangular side windows in
the EV pop top.  Only good thing they did, that plus the rear shower.
Lot of work to DIY to vanagon ones, but make the view way better when
cooking inside.

I've considered adding a tiny awning/vestibule from the front poptop
edge, bungeed to all the tie-downs on the luggage rack.  This way you
could leave the front panel unzipped in heavy rains.

bye, Tim
