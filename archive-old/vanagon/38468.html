Subject: 78 Timing and Sqeak Questions

OK, here's the scenario...78 Hydraulic Valve engine, 120 lbs compression
across, did a timing check today and discovered that it's reading at around
24degrees BTDC. I reset it to 7.5 BTDC and reset the idle to around
875-900rpm. Sounded like crap, started backfiring when I accelerated.
Re-set it to 24BTDC and runs good. What am I up against? I'm pretty
confused and have made an appointment here in the SF Bay Area to get a
tune-up done, but would like to know if anyone has any advice for me...

Also, after I fill up the tank, the Bus acts a little funny, kind of
hick-ups for a bit, sort of hesitates on acceleration, but when the fuel
level goes down a bit it seems fine, any ideas?

ONE More question (sorry), the right rear suspension has a pretty nasty
sqeak to it, right around where the spring plate is, I tried putting some
grease in around there to no avail, any suggestions as it's extremely
annoying...?

What seems to be a &quot;normal&quot; oil consumption for an engine in pretty good
shape, 2.0L, with a couple minor drips? Thanks again for any and all
advice!

&quot;Who are You?&quot;
&quot;I'm fine thanks, who are you?&quot;
&quot;I'm fine too, but you no get in without the password&quot;
