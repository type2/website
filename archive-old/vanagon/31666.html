Subject: Re: Update on drain Plug (stripped)

Dave,

Clean your bolt, as in super-shiny clean.  MEK.  Nuclear radiation.
 Grandma's lye soap.  Get every bit of oil off the thing.  Now gunk it up
with #2 Permatex (the non-hardening stuff).  Work it in with your fingers.
 (Uck!  Now you'll never get it off your fingers.)  Get it right down into
the threads.  NOW screw it into your aluminum crankcase, the one I thot was
steel. 

#2 Permatex is an excellent anti-galling compound.  It will remain in the
threads of the bolt long after the Pyramids have turned to dust.  And keep
your steel bolt from welding to your cast aluminum crankcase.  The Permatex
also acts as a sealant, and as an adhesive.  

Steel into aluminum isn't a good idea for a drain plug.  The aluminum is
going to expand, not only diametrically but within the thread-pitch.  This
will force the aluminum into the microscopic serrations in the bolt's
threads, which will lead to galling, which will lead to stripping out the
thread in the crankcase.  The Permatex will prevent this.

Removing the bolt when the aluminum was stony cold would have been better
than doing it hot, but oil is drained when warm, not cold.  The deck was
stacked against you.

Brass would have been a better choice for the bolt, or a steel insert in the
casting.  You may wish to consider a bolt-within-a-bolt, the outer bolt
acting as a sleeve, prevented from moving when you remove the smaller inner
bolt which serves as the actual drain.  Another idea would be some sort of
valve -- anything that would allow you to drain the sump without having to
torque a steel bolt in &amp; out of the aluminum casting.  

With a steel bolt in an aluminum casting, it's only a matter of time before
you'll be forced to renew the thread in the casting.  Stripping the thing out
wasn't your fault, it was a design flaw.  A better method would have been a
large diameter, coarse-threaded aluminum drain plug fitted with an O-ring, as
seen on motorcycles and aircraft engines.

If you can drill the head of the bolt, it might be wise to safety-wire it.
 Use the fine gauge stuff (.028&quot; or .032&quot;).  If the bolt has a large head,
try drilling just a corner.
