Subject: Re:  Big Sur trip

YES, definitely, the Big Sur trip is on!  The roster follows below, and under
that, suggested things to bring.  And of course, the more stuff to burn
the better.  :)   - as usual, please let me know if there's any changes to
the list of people attending.  -/martha

----------

Packing list - oops, I couldn't find this file as readily as I had hoped.  Will
keep looking.  In the meantime, here's what occurs to me as being priorities:

firewood
drinks (or whatever you &quot;do))
lawn chairs - one per person in your group
rain/wind gear
snacks/appetizers
food to share - stay tuned for more particulars on this closer to camp time.
ice
quarters for the showers there
all else you usually bring camping
