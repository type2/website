They are not &quot;really&quot; hydraulically actuated, they are being driven by
the Cams and, ofcourse, once the inlet hole is covered and they are
starting to be forced the pressure inside climbs to precisely that 
needed to counter the spring. The oil pressure around the rest of the 
system is irrelevant.
