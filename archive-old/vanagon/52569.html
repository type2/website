&gt;&gt; This is a tale of two heads ;-).
&gt;&gt; The heads arrived but the shop owner was concerned that there may be 
&gt;&gt; some cracks in the heads.  He said the area between the valves or near 
&gt;&gt; the plugs was where he has found them before.  Cracks in this area are 
&gt;&gt; an early step to dropping a valve into the cylinder,  very bad 
&gt;&gt; happening.  Under a magnifier there was one suspicious area between two 
&gt;&gt; of the valves but it was not obvious.

&gt;   In,..,.,.. I think ??, It was the Bentley manual It state that small 
&gt;   cracks in this area are useable!

I have used heads, both in air cooled and water cooled VWs (Rabbit variety)
with as much as 2mm worth of crack between the valve seats as you described.
A service bulletin from VW states the proper way to check this is to
reinstall the head, fully warm up the engine, and check compression. Kind of
a severe test, who wants to reinstall a bad head. If it ran well before you
took it apart, leaking coolant or was OK until the haed gasket went. Use the
head.
