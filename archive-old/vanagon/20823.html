Subject: Refinements to westfalia rear cabinet:1982?
Date: Fri, 14 Jul 1995 10:36:19 -0600 (MDT)

Hello,
I now have my rear cabinet out of the vanagon and on this momentus occasion,
I'd like to ask ... has anyone modified their cabinet to do the following:
(1) there is a space at the top of the cabinet which has no access under
normal circumstances.  How can I modify this to provide extra space?
(2) there is a lot of space between the back of the cabinet and the wall of
the camper.  I would like to use this space by removing the back of the
cabinet and also placing something that partially blocks the side rear 
driver's side window.  Has anyone make this modification?
(3) I would like to run a garden hose from my pump out through the back of
the cabinet.  I believe some of the newer vans have something like this, but
how is the hose run?
Thanks,
Stuart
