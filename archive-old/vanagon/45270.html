From: dworkin_at_ari_dot_net (H Steven Dolan)
Subject: VA - Free Seminar on Front Axle Beam Installation ;-)

Where:Springfield, VA

When: June 30 (Sunday) _at_ ~9:00AM

What: I need some help switching out the front axle beam on my bus.

Why:  Well, I just took the '73 in for it's first annual VA safety
inspection.  I knew that the front axle beam had enough rust to warrant
eventual replacement, but the ball joints and tie rods *looked* intact.  In
addition, driving it wasn't any &quot;windier&quot; than I consider normal in a
breadloaf.  But the inspector saw it differently, and proved it to me to the
point where I have decided a switch is the right thing to do.  Since I had
held out the beam from the '79 we stripped recently for eventual
installation in the '73, it isn't the tragedy it could have been.

Please, if you have a couple of hours free Sunday morning, come on by and
give me a hand.  It is a fairly heavy piece and it goes much faster with 4-5
people.  Beer, Soda, and (afterwards) Generous Georges Positive Pizza provided.
