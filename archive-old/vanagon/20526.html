Subject:  my new vanagon

the 81 adventurewagen arrived last week, and i'm very happy.  the
permanently high roof is really cool, and the woodwork is pretty nice,
although water stained. the vehicle is definitely in need of some love,
however.  there are small amounts of rust in some seams, the last paint
job was cheap,  interiors pretty thrashed, slider door handle needs
attention, and there are many other little things which i will enjoy fixing.  i 
think i have sufficient motivation to redo the interior, and (after having
checked the archives) am fishing for ideas on covering/replacing the
tired materials which are currently exposed.  also, i retrieved some
rotted, cracked, and warped parts of a rolled :-( westy interior, which i
am going to use as templates to build some new cabinets. i also got the
bench seat unit.  any suggestions on printed, simple woodworking
references?  the bench seat will also need to be restuffed/upholstered
(as will the front seats).  i'm also thinking of installing a thin wood floor in
the back, and recarpeting the front.  if there are any
suggestions/pointers on any of this, or nightmares to avoid, any sharing
would be greatly appreciated.  

thanks, matthew
