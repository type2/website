Subject: Re: Golf/Jetta engine in gas Vanagon

In all this discussion about conversions, has there been any thoughts on a
GAS Golf engine in a GAS vanagon?  There always seems to be references to
diesel conversions, and I'm getting confused.

If one does a GAS to GAS conversion, does one need diesel parts?

If anybody has info on this topic please forward it to me.  After I turn my
GTI into a G60, I'm thinking of using the old engine in my '85 Westy.
Modified, the Golf engine will get about 130 hp!
