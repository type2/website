&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; In earlier Vanagons there is a metal partition just behind the front row of
&gt; seats. Later Vanagons seem to drop this so you can walk to the back.
&gt; 
&gt; Why was the partition there? Was it for structural strength/rigidity or was
&gt; it just to separate the front from the back? If the latter is there any
&gt; reason not to remove it?
