&gt; Looks like your plan does not bring you to the Big Apple (NYC)and Broadway.
&gt; Should you change your mind, there is a Mariner across the Hudson River
&gt; in Jersey City that accomodates RVs and campers. If expensive accomodation
&gt; was deterring you besides other things,you may want to consider it.
&gt; I believe the grounds are charging $35.00 per day for the big rigs
&gt; which has electric hookups ,shower and laundry facilities. The PATH
&gt; subway takes you right into the heart of the City for a dollar in only
&gt; a few minutes. The place has 24hours security patrol.

Thanks for the suggestion, Terry!  But if I'm paying $35/night for a camping
spot, I better get a continental breakfast, a free swimming lesson, and a
massage too.  =)  I guess that's the price you pay for being close to the
city...
