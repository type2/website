Subject: A neat idea for vanagon protection


I can't help but wonder why anyone would steal a diesel westy -- to use
as a getaway car, maybe?  (don't get mad -- I own one!!!!)

&gt;   Sometime ago, I inquired about antitheft devices for the vanagon (diesels).
&gt;   Amazingly, I saw this in the newsgroup alt.revenge.  It seems that this same
&gt;   idea could be used on the diesel vanagons on the fuel pump, I think.
