Subject: Re: MORE 'you MAY be a devoted VW bus owner if:'

And a few more:

-you keep tailights on your bookshelf for no other reason than they are
nice to look at
-&quot;want&quot; rather than &quot;need&quot; is the deciding criteria when making vw purchases
-you are dismayed when the gov't proposes raising the highway speed limit
(now i am gonna have even more irate car drivers behind me!)
-you find having heat in a car to be a novelty rahter than a must
-you often find yourself rubber necking (and your car weaving) at old
busses going in the opposite direction
-when looking at new places to live primary consideration is always given
to the size of the garage and parking space ( i wonder how many busses ican
fit in there)
-you are on a first name basis with local tow truck drivers :)
