&gt;ANSWER #1
&gt;A Fan.  No, really, those neat little add-on top dashboard fans do stir
&gt;the air around, they don't pull that much current ....

&gt;&gt;Greetings VolksFolks..........
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;While sitting inside a very stuffy vanagon during a torrential
&gt;&gt;downpour at
&gt;&gt;O'Leno State Park Campout this past weekend, we were trying to
&gt;&gt;determine
&gt;&gt;how to improve, increase, or modify ANYTHING to get some ventilation.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Question #1:
&gt;&gt;I would be *very* interested to hear what ingenuity the &quot;Royal&quot; and
&gt;&gt;&quot;Collective&quot; &quot;We&quot; has invented in that regard.....

&gt;&gt;Thanks!
&gt;&gt;

Louise-
        Hella makes a great little fan for boats that would work well in
that situation.  It only draws .27 of an amp and costs about $25.  It looks
nice too.

Thanks,
Stephen
