&gt;Is anyone using a Bosch 009 distributer on a 1700cc pancake engine?  
&gt;I was told that the 009's were made for a different engine(Bug 
&gt;engine) and that they retard the spark to the #3 cylinder.  I was 
&gt;told that this is not needed for a bus engine because the #3 cylinder 
&gt;does not have an overheating problem like the bug.  I bought a 1974 
&gt;camper with a 1700cc engine(hardly ran) an it has an 009 distributer 
&gt;on it.  I am in the process of rebuilding the engine now.  The same 
&gt;guy who told me all this about the 009 said that to put it in a 
&gt;pancake engine the right way you have to cut the tins a little. Has 
&gt;anyone had to do this.  He also said he has seen alot of people that 
&gt;have it put in backwards so that the #1 plug is retarded. If anyone 
&gt;knows the right way to put a 009 on a pancake(assuming there is a 
&gt;right way), will you please Email me with the info.  Thanks alot.

It will work.  The small timing difference does not make a noticeable
difference.  Pancakes also cook and drop valves anyway.  I prefer 050 as it
has more advance.  28 degrees.
