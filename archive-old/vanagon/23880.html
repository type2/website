Subject: '78 F.I. Problems.

Well as the saga of my $400 '78 Westy goes on problems 
loom on the horizon.  About halfway through the trip
home last weekend after 100 uneventful miles, she started
missing badly on a long uphill grade in 4th, downshifted to
3rd and made it up, at the time I attributed it to bad gas
as the tank was about 1/2 full of old (3+ months) gas when
I got her, and I added gas in DC with that new super oxegenated
crap that seems to make any car run poorly IMHO.  Well the
rest of the trip she continued missing but in a funny sort
of way, in the heart of the powerband (say 2000-4000 rpm if
she had a tach) she bucks and seems to miss, obviously seems
worse under load, sometimes loss of power is profound. From
idle to 1750 or so it's fine and once the revs climb near the
limit its fine, so on the way back I had to storm on the flats
and down hill topped out at 75+ in 4th where she had power but
as gravity fought me uphill as I slowed to 65 or so she would
start bucking and I had to let it fall off, downshift and go
up the hills topped out in 3rd at 50-55.  POwer is very good
if the revs are kept near redline, compression is good all round
but a bit uneven, #1, #3 about 120-125 psi, #2, #4 about 140-145
psi.  When I stopped after the first major missing on the way back
I pulled the plugs quickly and put in a set of nearly new Bosch
Supers.  Pulled them today and all were covered with fine sootish
black, like she is running majorly rich, no exhaust smoke of any
color though.  Put in Bosch Platinums and smoothed out a little
while then back again (I figure they will look much the same and
we have Eug's word B Platinums don't like running rich).  Lets
see, points are nicely adjusted and fairly new, rotor and cap
a bit worn but OK, plug wires have been done recently, PO says
today when I emailed him that Bus had same problem 2-3 years back
and after sorting through many things (explaining recent wires, etc)
the problem ended up being the STARTER SWITCH? which was replaced to
solve the problem.  Now I'm still not ruling out the latent gas and
I've put a can of FI cleaner in and am going to run it a little
to clean out the metal fuel lines 78's seem to have, then I'll drain
the tank, replace all the rubber lines, and fuel filter which need
done anyway.  Plus all the vacuum lines are pretty old, though all seem
to be connected so I'll replace them too though.  The one thing
terrifying me is that the air flow sensor is pretty worn and probably
origional at 136k, tracks under the brushes in the carbon? are fairly
deep.  If this is the problem, I gues I'm in the market for a
replacement if anyone has one about.  Anyway thoughts and suggestions
highly appreciated.
