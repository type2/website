&gt; How about doing some phenomenal trip with both groups in the year 2000
&gt; to mark the turn of the month, year, decade, century, and millenium?  Well,
&gt; technically I guess this happen in 2001, but it seems the rest of
&gt; the world is fairly focused on 2000, so I thought we should be, too.
&gt; 
&gt; How about a marathon trip to somewhere REALLY obscure for most of
&gt; us - like Tierra del Fuego?
&gt; 
&gt; I know this is off in the future, but with something of this
&gt; magnitude, I figure we'd need lots of time for people to plan
&gt; for vacations, time-offs, sabbaticals, etc., not to mention
&gt; getting their vehicles ready and/or upgraded.
&gt; 
&gt; Food for thought....
