Subject: Re: mud flaps for busses

&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;Would anyone know a source for mud flaps? I found a pair in the West Coast
&gt;Metric catalog for about $35, but they seem to be for the rear wheels
&gt;only. I would need at least one for the front/right to protect the propane
&gt;tank that sits right under the sliding door. 
&gt;
&gt;It looks at if there once used to be a mud flap behind the
&gt;front/right wheel: a metal piece that could have been part of a mud flap is
&gt;still there.  Sami ('75 Westy)

Hey, I was just about to ask about this very thing.  I'm considering
installing the mudflaps on the '71 and wondered if anyone had good/bad
things to say about them, or how they mount.

Sincerely,
Eugene
