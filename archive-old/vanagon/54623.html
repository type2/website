Subject: Re: Vanagon Eng Wire Harness needed

&gt;I'm looking for a new/used wiring harness (control unit multi-pin plug to
&gt;AFS, injectors, temp sensor, coil, etc.) that fits in the engine
&gt;compartment (not the full chasis harness!) for my 1982 Vanagon (aircooled,
&gt;fuel-injected, 2.0L stock, USA/Federal version). If you or anyone you know
&gt;has one laying around, I'd be VERY interested in taking it off their
&gt;hands.

Every aircooled vanagon I've ever seen in the junkyards have the wiring harness
still left on them. It's one of those parts that no one usually needs.  Look
around a bit, and I'm sure you'll be able to get one cheaper yourself, rather
than having someone pull it off for you.  (ie, I wouldn't pay more than 10 bucks
for it)
