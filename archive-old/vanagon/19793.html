Subject:  another oil temp question

update on the journey of mobius the white 81 adventurewagen:  my
brother left los angeles with mobius, girlfriend, and a significant amount
of stuff on board on about the 10th, and arrived in bellingham, wa (lummi
island) on about the 22nd.  he just left to go around the olympic
peninsula, then head here to michigan.  no major mishaps except finding
the belts exposed on the rr tire (luckily before it blew).  i am sort of
wondering about the oil temp, however.  he said it is staying at about
180, but gets to 200 on some inclines (where he said he's been passed
by several wasserboxers). from what i've heard, i'm happy with this (the
temp), but it seems a little low.  i'm wondering if this is in a realistic range,
or if maybe the sensor is not calibrated/placed properly.  is this
possible/probable?  am i being overly analytical for no apparent reason? 
in any case, things seem to be running smoothly-only one more week to
go.
