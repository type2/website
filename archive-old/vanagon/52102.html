&gt; &gt; Volks,
&gt; &gt; Is the &quot;Sierra&quot; brand an acceptable substitute for VW dealer coolant
for 
&gt; &gt; use in a wasserboxer?. I will have to drive 50 miles and pay $15/gal
for 
&gt; &gt; VW coolant. The local VW shop sells Sierra rather than VW coolant due
to 
&gt; &gt; the cost they say. Tell me volks, what to do. Also, what of the pink 
&gt; &gt; Toyota phosphate-free coolant? Is this more acceptable? I heard from
one 
&gt; &gt; source that Sierra does not have that good of an anti-corrosion package

&gt; &gt; and this is the last thing I want, even though it is phosphate-free.
Any 
&gt; &gt; and all feedback appreciated.
&gt; &gt; Regards

&gt; Call Jill Jasek, at Sierra: 800-288-7234.  She's anwered all of my
&gt; questions to my satisfaction about Sierra and its properties. I use it in
&gt; my '84 Westy, including  the flush product and the hydrometer (?) used to
&gt; test, and to date, after about about six months, I've had no evidence of
&gt; any deterioration. If you are still concerned about rust and corrosion
&gt; inhibition,  ask her for a source for comparative data and information,
&gt; which I assume she has available.
