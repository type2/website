BTW all, in regards to the below, I have added a tech article on the BA6
to my web page.  It was written by Jack Reed and posted to the Vanagon
list in '95.

&gt; Hi All,
&gt;
&gt; Just a reminder for those who have joined since the type-2 split.  Lots
&gt; of heater info is avail. in older archives, for both BN-4 and
&gt; BA-6(newer) models.  And likely much more in Type-2 list archives.
&gt; Eberspacher/Espar, the makers, no longer support these two models, but
&gt; have literature/service bulletins avail.  Overload them with requests
&gt; and you may kill a valuable resource.  They do not have much in parts,
&gt; if any, for either heater, particularly the older BN-4.
