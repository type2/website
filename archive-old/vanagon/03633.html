I always keep my antenna set up with the tip about an inch higher than 
the top of the roof... When entering a new parking garage I just drive 
slowly and keep an eye on the ant. tip.  If it touches the beams or 
plumbing etc... I back out.
I don't know if the antenna is long enough to surpass the roof of a 
westy, but if it is, you may want to try it out.

&gt; &gt; I've checked the usual sources, but couldn't find what the height of a
&gt; &gt; Vanagon Westfalia is.  Does anyone know?  (I'm wondering if one would fit
&gt; &gt; in my garage.)  Thanx!
