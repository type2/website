Subject:       Re: propane fill valve

Fill valves.  First off, search the archives as we've posted the 
source for repair kits, problems etc. there.

Now.  I just got done re-building my fill-valve due to leaking when 
filling, well it just leaked once but it really scared me.

The valve fills flawlessly now.  The repair kit is $4.00 and is easy 
to install.
