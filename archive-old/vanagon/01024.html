Subject: Ignition switch barrel and tumbler replacement?


Greetings again,

Has anyone out there replaced the barrel and tumblers on their
ignition switch?  I need to do this for Georg, my 1973 campmobile
and the VW place wants $80 labor.  I'm already paying $42 for the
barrel-tumblers-keys package and would like to save a little by
doing the installation myself if possible.  Also, the locksmith
I talked to says a lot of the VW ignition switch barrels are
riveted closed and that rekeying them is not an option as it is
with the door locks.  This means that once I replace the ignition
barrel, I will have two keys for the vehicle, ignition and doors.
Anyone have a way around this one besides haveing all the doors
rekeyed?

Cheers,

 -Dyer
