&gt; Third, what I'm trying to do is (if I understand correctly) find a
&gt;  two-person middle seat (and parts) that faces forward and can be
&gt;  readily, and easily, removed and can also be slid outward a foot or so
&gt;  for access to the refrigerator.  I'm not interested in rear-facing
&gt;  seats, or the single-person seats, and I don't think I'm interested in
&gt;  the seats that fold back (certainly not a deal-breaker).

WAAAAIIIITTTT!  Hold it right there!  This thread started out with someone
wanting to know how to remove their center seat.  Now you want to install a
center seat into a Camper model.  Quite a different undertaking.  I've heard
that a standard 2 person seat will fit in the middle of a Camper version, but
block access to the refer.  You'd need to unbolt it to slide it and get to
the refer.  A setup where you might leave the seat in for everyday use and
then remove it when camping.

Good luck,
