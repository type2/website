Some time back I was rambling around one of my favorite desert haunts and 
came upon a truly interesting Swedish Military Vehicle being driven &quot;around
the world&quot; by two swedes.  It was a Volvo &quot;puppy&quot; they said.  ~20&quot; rims
ragged and battered looking like a breadbox on wheels.  Most functional 
looking and with a 5x2Forward and 2sp reverse and articulated suspension
(read reduction gears) it probably could go whereever a unimog might but 
with much better fuel economy so they said.  Volvo turbo diesel power and
25mpg.  But man it was plug ugly!
