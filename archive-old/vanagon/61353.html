Subject: GET YER LIST STICKERS HERE!!!!!


 Howdy all. Many thanks to those of you who have already ordered your list
stickers. However, I've still got about 800 to go, so here I am again, plugging
away. Feel free to order more. I am hoping to get pictures of the stickers, and
also the coffee mugs online in the near future, so everyone can see them...
Anyway, here's the spiel for those looking for something new... I have lost
my mind and ordered up a batch of exciting list stickers in a brilliant new
design. (Thus rendering all first edition list stickers out-of-date){shameless
marketing ploy} Besides, your bus needs to feel loved, and would really
appreciate a new sticker.
Anyway, the original purpose of these list stickers is to serve as a quick and
easy way to identify other list members' vehicles. Generally placed on the
lower left corner of the rear window, they are easily visible and recognizable.
You can put one on a windshield corner, but check local laws first...In that
fine tradition of sticker, may I present the new design:

a 4&quot; circular sticker, once again professionally printed on the shiny,
eye-catching chrome mylar. This time you get TWO colors of printing...The
design is the Wheel of a bus, from the hubcap with central VW logo, to the bus
wheel, and black tire. The tire has white writing on it spelling out the
Vanagon_at_Lenti address, and the WWW.type2_dot_com address on it. It is just dandy

Anyway, here's the pricing info. Because I had to order 1000 stickers, (too
offset the cost increase from printing with 2 colors), the price will be the
same as the first round, basically in package deals-
$5.00 for 3 stickers
$10.00 for 7 stickers
and for you big spenders
$20.00 for 20 stickers
(Anyone wanting more than that should contact me for details)

There is no extra charge for shipping handling, because you will be providing
it with your order, in the form of a self-addressed, STAMPED envelope of the
BUSINESS SIZE (don't send those cute little note envelopes, unless you want the
stickers folded. Remember, they're 4&quot;)
The exception to this of course is the non-USA orders. It wouldn't do much good
to send foreign stamps, so if you are in this category, please send an extra
$1.00 for foreign postage.

Because the price is so low, and you're sending another envelope to hide it in,
I'd rather you please send cash. Make sure it's hidden, please...

So, here's what you need to send
a self addressed, STAMPED envelope, 4 inches or larger,
along with your cash for the stickers to:

Richard Stickerboy Palmer
121-C Park Ave
Raleigh NC
27605-1832
IMPORTANT: please write the number of stickers you are ordering on the corner
of your envelope.

The turnaround time on these will be MUCH shorter than the coffee mugs...
 I already put the order in Wednesday, so please order away.
NOTE: if you are one of the 4 or 5 people that sent orders in the last few
months, don't worry, I've still got your envelopes, so you're already covered.

Anyway, thanks, and have a lovely day, and order a lot, because 1000 stickers
will go a loooonnnnggg way.
:)
