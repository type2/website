Subject: Re: Sorta Sticking Speedo

Thanks for the details of the options available for dealing with the 
reluctant speedo, or occasionally reluctant speedo. Everything else in 
the unit seems to keep on working - odometer and trip odometer, so I 
think the plastic gear gremlin is probably the culprit here too.
Thanks for the advice - again. :)
Jack
