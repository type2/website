Subject: Comprehensive Insurance on '89 Westfalia
Date: Fri, 08 Apr 94 08:56:30 -0400
From: jrp_at_widcat.widener_dot_edu


I want to add comprehensive insurance to my coverage of my '89 Westfalia
as I am driving it back and forth to work now instead of storing it in my
garage waiting for weekends to go camping...

(Face it, I blew up my Fox and I have to drive my Bus)

At any rate, the Insurance company wants to know the value of all of my
additions (full Westfalia package with fridge, stove, sink, and whatnot)
and I want to give them a reasonable value.

Any ideas? Just go with list price? More? Less?

Thanks!
