&gt; Hello everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; Since the logistics of purchasing it and getting it back to Seattle, I am
&gt; passing on a '93 Eurovan at a used car dealer outside of Nashville. Letting
&gt; this one go stings a bit because the asking price is about $2000 less than
&gt; EVs around here with twice the mileage.
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone is interested in an EV GL with the power group, 5 speed, 25,000
&gt; miles at $13,900, let me know directly and I'll email the HTML document
&gt; with all the particulars.
&gt; 
&gt; There will always be another van, there will always be another van.....
