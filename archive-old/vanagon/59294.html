The owners manual states 2005 lbs payload. I have filled the bed of mine
(many times)with wood mulch until it was stacked to the roof line
without any problem. I have also stacked firewood untill the bed was
totaly full(plus some). These both included driving at highway speeds.
Good luck and be careful.

&gt;Does anyone have an idea as to how much weight can be safely

&gt;in a Vanagon crew cab.  So that the engine is not stressed or the deck
