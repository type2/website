Still on the track of replacing salt corroded cooling pipes.
Thanks to Lloyd I was referred to Tim Smith at UNB_dot_ca who wrote extensively
on how to replace these with rubber. I have trekked with blood-shot eyes
through recent archives and have not found the article.
Anyone out there save it or know which archive it's in?

Many thanks

Leo
Best regards,

Judith and Leo
