Subject: Re: Thermostat Location?

I raised the front wheels quite high in the air when I bled it, but maybe 
I didn't bleed it long enough.  I let it quit bubbling and tightened the 
cap screw back up.

I don't want to replace the thermostat, either, given the need to work 
around the AC pump.  What a nuisance.

I think I need to get the manual and study the schematics and plumbing.  

I mentioned at the very onset that I had a slight coolant smell that I 
associated with the rear heater.  I think I was told this could wait, but 
now I'm wondering if it isn't intimately related with letting air in the 
system?  

When I get the book, I'm going to start over.  I'm doing too many things 
at the same time, and in my experience, it doesn't work.
