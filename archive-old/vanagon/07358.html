&gt;A friend of mine had a really cool VW.  It was a phone repair vehicle from
&gt;Germany.  Basically it was a bus on a bug chassis.  Someone had converted
&gt;it into a camper, but most of the original interior was intact.  It had
&gt;beautifully made wood cabinets for tools and the like and a collapsable
&gt;front passenger seat so there was more interior room when needed.  The
&gt;front end looked like an oversized Bug with a big wrap around windshield. 
&gt;There was a gas heater up front, under the hood, near the gas tank and
&gt;spare tire.   We figured it was from the mid sixties based on the running
&gt;gear.  It had Bus type sliding doors on both sides and these extended from
&gt;the front seats back.  You folded back the front seats to get into the rear
&gt;compartment.  The doors locked open so you could drive with them that way. 
&gt; I've never seen one of these around since... Anyone else?
&gt;

Strange, that...I'm from old Chairmanie and I've seen plenty of phone
repair vehicles, but never one of those.  Then again, that probably
doesn't mean squat, since there are many other things that exist and
I've never seen.  Such ramblings...is it Friday yet, unca Joel?
