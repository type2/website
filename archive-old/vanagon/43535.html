Subject: Re: my answers to the EV


To Kevin...the noise you are hearing may be the power steering pump on 
&quot;overload&quot;....my EV makes a hideous sound when the wheel is cranked over 
full...so did my wife's Golf GT, our Subaru Outback, and most of the other 
cars I know that have power steering...



To the Rest of youze...
 

The dripping stuff people are talking about is the factory 
rustproofing...quite frankly I'd rather have &quot;the steady drip drip drip of 
gonnah...&quot; oops nothing like having a flashback to an old Cheech and Chong 
routine....   but as I was going to say, I'd rather deal with that inner 
panel rust proofing than to have to deal with rust....


The marks on the dipstick indicate a litre of oil down...as opposed to a 
quart down...but what's a few MLs amongst friends...

Gas gauges.....it has been my experience that on the EV the Red area of the 
gauge is about two gallons...and the remaining part of the gauge is divided 
to reflect the remaining 19 or so gallons in the tank....that's why it seems 
like the first 1/2 of the tank seems to go so slow...


Beware of leaves clogging up the drain holes in the area above the hood! In 
the right and left hand corners of the hood area where the front fenders 
join up to the body, there should be two drain holes....however leaves and 
debris seem to collect in there and block off the drains...

BTW EVers....its time to change your fuel and air filters!!!
