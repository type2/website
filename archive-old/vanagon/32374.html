&gt;through detachable jumper cables.  The engine is powered by a gasoline oil
&gt;mixture and its 20-ounce tank will run the generator for about an hour.

Arrrrgggghhhh!
Don't you realize this means its a two-cycle engine? Hell, why don't you
just bring your chainsaw and fire it up to cut some firewood while you're
out there? Those RV'ers with 4-cycle generators are bad enough in
campgrounds w/o a 2-stroker around!


While I'm sure this is a wonderful product for use in emergency situations
(or to keep the freezer running when electric is out for 2 days like us
last month) its sounds kind of noisy to use around other people.

IMHO of course,
