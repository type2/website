Subject: Westy 12v water pump

The water pump in my potable water tank won't pump.  Power to the unit,
ground OK, but no operation.  The local RV center doesn't  have a
replacement and the VW dealer's price is $60.00.

Does anyone know of a source for a replacement submersible 12 volt water
pump?

TIA
