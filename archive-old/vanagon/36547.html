Subject: Re: Timing (1975-1979 Type IV Fuel Injected Engines)

&gt;Hey now
&gt;
&gt;Sorry I forgot to thank you for the timing info for my bus!
&gt;
&gt;Actually, I have the manual.  My problem is that I never used
&gt;a timing light before, only a static timing light.  I have a
&gt;cool Sears timing gun, but don't know how to use it!

Jay,

Okay, it should be pretty simple (if the tuning gods are smiling your way):

First, set the new points you just installed to .40 mm or .016&quot; or so.
Then,  hook the dwellmeter/tachmeter (with the switch set to tach) positive
end to the positive side of the coil, the negative wire hooked to ground.

After the engine has warmed up, set the idle (you have a '79, right?) to
900-950 RPM, using the large-slotted idle screw on the throttle body.

If you have a normal modern timing gun, you hook up the red clamp to the
positive terminal of the battery and the black terminal to ground and clamp
the weird-looking rectangular, jawed part around the Cylinder #1 spark plug
wire.

With the engine idling at 900-950 RPM, place the timing gun very close to
the degree scale above the pulley.  Pull the trigger.  It should read at 7.5
degrees below top dead center (BTDC) at idle.  If not, loosen the long 10 mm
bolt that's to the rear and right of the distributor.  Turn the distributor
slowly, until the pulsing timing light lines up with the 7.5 degrees dot.
Tighten the distributor.  Recheck the timing.

That's it.  You should check the dwell by switching the dwellmeter/tachmeter
to Dwell.  It should read according to the specs I sent you (44 to 50 degrees).

Have Fun,

Cheese
