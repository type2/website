Anyone Been Through This?  Am I Nuts For Thinking I Can Find A   
Replacement Part For Under $60.00?  I Found One In A Junkyard, With The   
Wires Cut For $35.00.  I Brought It Home Because I Thought I Could Maybe   
Solder My Wires Onto It.  Long Story Short, Next Time I'll Know Better.   
 The Connecter Transfered The Heat Directly To The 22 Year Old Plastic   
And Promptly Melted It. (Thus Rendering A $35 Dollar Part Useless)

Is There A Similar Replacement In Another Variety Of VW? (Like A Bug?)

Or Can Anyone Recommend A Reasonable Place To Buy Ths From?

On A Different Note, Was Anyone At The Bug-O-Rama In Phoenix This   
Weekend?  ... I Had My Eye Out For List Stickers.

Thanks In Advance,
Eric B.
