Hey thanks for your input. I guess it shows that I'm not an electrician
right ffrom the start. That's why I had qualified electricians and
automotive electrical specialist look the situation over.

You are right, I checked the documentation and it is 1200 Watts (oops on
my part). Still nothing that I used to place the load exceeded or came up
to the rating of the Model PV 1200.

We used 4 guage wire and I remember them testing thue unit with several
meters.

We tried the unit with my Aux battery, the main battery, the engine running
and even hooked four heavy-duty truck batteries ... nothing worked.

One of the other camper vehicles in our vicinity had an inverter (not
Tripp Light AND smaller power rating). We tried that inverter. The microwave
worked fine.

While this is not a pleasure for me, it may help save someone else the
grief to know about this.
