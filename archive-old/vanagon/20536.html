Subject: Westy tents

I was wondering if anyone knows where I might be able to find a
free-standing Westy tent that would fit a '93 Eurovan MV Weekender?

Awnings are nice, and I know you can get them with &quot;screen wall&quot;
attachments,&quot; but I'd like something that I can drive away from and then
come back to and do sort of a docking maneuver (like Atlantis and MIR).
Don't want to pack everything up that's in the tent when I take the van
somewhere, in other words.

Do they sell these in Germany perhaps? Anybody know where I could get a
German Westy accessories catalogue?

Your help is appreciated. Thanks in advance.

Jeff
