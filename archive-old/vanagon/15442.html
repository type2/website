Subject: Re: Alternatives to the 009 distributor

&gt;Someone had commented about alternative distributors to the 009, and I
&gt;am specifically looking for the model #'s and why they are better.  ya
&gt;know, like the 022 and 050 models.
&gt;
&gt;THanks,
&gt;Thom

I have heard that the 050 doesn't retard the spark on the #3 cylinder.  The 
others aparently do retard the spark on #3 including the 009.  I guess the 
bumb for #3 is just a wee bit later than the others.  I don't know about the 
rest (022).
Isn't the 050 OEM on the T4 engines?
