Yeah, I'd love a 20 gallon tank, but I'd be happy with 15 gallons.  And 
rumour has it that a 68-72 tank will fit in the split window buses.  
They go for $17 at the wrecking yard here, and look like they should 
fit.  
And I get about 18/19 MPG on a daily basis with a SP 1600.  Somehow I 
got 30 MPG on the trip to Big Sur.
