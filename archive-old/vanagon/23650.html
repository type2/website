&gt;Funny how stories change in transit. I heard that one in Florida in 1991,
&gt;but it was a $50 Corvette...He was in the bahamas with his new girlfriend
&gt;too. Urban legends...go figure.

that's what is so weird ... cause this really did happen around me! you hear
about stuff like that and then it happens. go figure. unless, of course,
harvey the manager was lying. and i personally think he was too pissed off
to be making it up. maybe the mercedes wife heard the story, too???

it gets weirder ... my previous job to that was with United Airlines in
chicago. there was this programmer who was a big corvette nut. one day he
comes in with a big grin ... we ask him what's so funny. it seems that he
had seen an ad in the paper about a 58 chevy 2-door. something about the
ad strikes him as odd, so he calls. the old lady says she doesn't know what
it is, but it's little and it's taking up her garage ... it was her husband's
car, and he died back in May (this was like September). he had always kept
it inside during the winter, and she wanted to park HER car inside this
winter, so she wanted to sell the old car.

yup. it was a 58 corvette. Bozlinkski nearly shit when he saw it. he tried
to tell the lady what she had, but she didn't care ... she just wanted the
thing out of the garage. and she wouldn't take more than she had asked in
the paper ...$700. she had called the bank, and that's what they told her
a 58 chevy 2-door was worth. so he bought it.

now, a few days later, he drives up to work in this white 58 corvette ...
so ...  ???  yeah, i know ... another urban legend, but THAT one i saw!!!
go figure.

what if some of those &quot;legends&quot; got started from something REALLY happening??
kinda like jokes ... they have to start somewhere.

and why the hell can't it happen to me!!!!!?????? :(
(of course, you have to be in the right place and the right time and be able
recognize the opportunity!).
