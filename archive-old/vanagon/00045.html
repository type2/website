&gt;Sounds like it comes from under the floor, near one of the front wheels /
&gt;steering gear.  While in
&gt;warranty, it went back to the dealer a few times, but they couldn't find the
&gt;problem.  Tried remounting the fuel tank with new rubbers, and inspected the
&gt;brake calipers - no luck.

How about FOD (Foreign Object Debris) in the spare tire tray or something
like that.  We've also had things in the little storage volume under the
front seats that sounded like they were under the vehicle.
