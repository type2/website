Subject: 59 Crew Cab Kombi ?

Hi all,
Is there such a bus as a 59 Crew Cab Kombi?  Does anyone know?  It's what I 
want.  Do you know how much one should cost  I'm about done restoring a 72 
Type I convertible, and have rebuilt my 68 1600 engine and transmission so a 
restoration project would be fine.  Any information would be helpful.
Thanks,
Jody
