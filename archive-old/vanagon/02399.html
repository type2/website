Subject:      shower in a westy

once upon a time, derek had an article about some australians who rigged
up a hot water shower outfit in their water-cooled syncro bus. the water
tank was low in the bus (under the back seat, i think) so as not to affect
the handling. the heat was provided by running the coolant tubes through
(or near) the water tank (kinda like rerouting the little heater under
the back seat) and then a little electric pump finished it off.

as far as how to shower with 10 gallons, see if you can find a Bluejacket's
Manual at some army-navy store or old used bookstore. it's the basic training
manual for the navy. shipboard showers are like Paul said: wet -soap -scrub-
rinse. and be damn quick about it. :)

which is why navy people always smell like soap and have little suds behind
their ears. :)
