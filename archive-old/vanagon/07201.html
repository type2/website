&gt;The step in the passenger side front door on my '85 Vanagon fills up with
&gt;water every time it rains. It never fills up to the level of the carpet,
&gt;and the carpet isn't wet so I don't think it's leaking from the front of
&gt;the car.  The door is not full of water either, at least I don't hear it
&gt;sloshing around when I open the door.  Before I start investigating this
&gt;further, has anyone on the list experienced a similar leak. --

yup. it was the little vent window bottom hinge ... the rubber gasket was
not snug enough to the hinge, and it would drip a big drip about every
30 seconds or so. you have to sit inside the bus during rain (or convenient
water hose) to see it.

i cured mine with some black silicone seal ... it didn't take much at all
... and it hasn't leaked since.

hope it helps.
