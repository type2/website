Hey all,
While I was at the FLAPS tonight checking out their headlight selection,
I stumbled upon &quot;mood lights&quot; which are colored lights that replace
interior lights.  They had the VW Bus style interior light bulb, in blue
or red.  This would be pretty coolly (for a minute) considered
getting some blue ones to replace the white bulbs I have now so when I
open the door, the blue light just says &quot;this bus is funkeeeee.&quot;  Maybe
I'll have to go back and get them :) .  They also had regular type bulbs
in red or blue, and the packaging suggested them for use in parking
lights(!) tho I bet that's not quite legal.  

Sean
