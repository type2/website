David:

The number you gave is not referenced in the catalog. Could it just be the
&quot;part&quot; number *of* the pictograph itself?

What I did find, is that the correct dual sender for the air-cooled
vanagon is #360 009 with range 0-80 psi, thread 1/8-27 NPT, and warning
contact at 7.0 psi. The # stamped on the sender (at the base on the
hex-shaped &quot;nut&quot;) is 30/23. There is only one other dual sender with the same
thread BUT range 0-150 psi: it's part number is 360 025 and the warning
contact is 11.4 psi. The stamped # is 30/15.

Note that the recommended dual sender for the water-cooled vanagon is part
#360 023 with range 0-150 psi, thread M10 by 1K, and warning contact at
7.0 psi. The stamped # is 30/9. I don't know how close those two threads
are, but there could be potential for mix-up here. 

Good luck!
