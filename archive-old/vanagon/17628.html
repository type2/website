Subject: NO VANAGON MAIL SUNDAY AFTERNOON

On SUNDAY from 3:00pm until 8:00pm (-0400 CDT) the University of Minnesta's
entire network will be brought down.  This means that you won't be able to
reach the listserv and it won't be able to reach you.  I will probably leave
it running. 

NO VANAGON MAIL SUNDAY AFTERNOON.
