Need some help...

I've lost one of my wheel covers.  It has 9 aluminum-like fake &quot;spokes&quot; =
as well as fake lug nuts(black in color) surrounding the center of the =
wheel cover.  There is a graphic in the center of the cover that looks =
like the Arc de Triumph or a castle (use your imagination here).  I =
thought these were aftermarket, but I've seen them on other 80-81 =
Westies.  Noone seems to know where to order them.

Input greatly appreciated.
