     Hi All,
     
       I have responded privately to several post as to my interest in the 
     PNW trip.  So, now I am coming out of stealth mode and am making a 
     public bid as to my interest in going on such a trip if it happens 
     after late April.  My reason for wanting the date to be after late 
     April is I am getting married in six days and am going on a honeymoon 
     there after.  So, unfortunately, it would be near impossible for me to 
     organize or even go before then.  
       Looks like there are six people so far that have responded publicly:
         Rick
         Ronald McDonald
         Kathy
         Andrew Mera
         Chris
         Vince
     
       I put my vote in for any place that may have warm dryer weather 
     (notice I did not say dry--this is Spring in the PNW).  The dessert in 
     Oregon sounds good for warm and dryer-However, I also would not wish 
     to chain up to get there.  I am also interested in exploring more of 
     Washington.
       I will be away from my email from April 3-14.   So, I will accept 
     any date after April 25 and any place that sounds fun (especially when 
     there is a chance to meet other list members).
     
     Regards,
     Vince

&gt; Hey Rick, looks like you started something rolling. 
&gt; Why not try for a date and a place and see who else 
&gt; is interested?  We were thinking of doing something
&gt; over Memorial Day Weekend (May 24-26), if the weather 
&gt; cooperates:
&gt; 
&gt; -
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; - if lots of Oregonians speak up, I'd have no objection to 
&gt;   the mouth of the Columbia (Fort Canby)
&gt; 
Well, is anyone making a list? Are there any other interested Oregonians 
out there? How about you, Vince?
I suggest Eastern Oregon. Lots of places to explore, and almost 
guaranteed sunshine.
Cris.
