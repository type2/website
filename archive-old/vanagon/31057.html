About the Tom Wilson _Rebuilding your air-cooled VW_ book -- whoah!
This is an awesome book, and I sure wish I had it while I was
tearing the engine down... of course he doesn't tell you how to
get the piston pins out, but I wouldn't have sent the case off to
the shop with the crank-bearing dowel pins still in it either.  Sigh.

Cheap, too.  With UPS shipping from JC Whitneys I paid about $18
for it.  Took forever to get here though... almost two weeks.

Thanks to the folks that _insisted_ I buy the book!
