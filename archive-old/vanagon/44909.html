 you want it.  They do mail order.
 
 However, I don't know if they have bus/van axles nor do I know how much
 they will charge (GTI axles cost $99) but the axles come assembled and
 prelubed!
 
 That in itself justifies buying the whole axle, I HATE lubing cv joints!&gt;&gt;

I, too, HATE lubing CVs.  I just finished removing &amp; lubeing my CVs this
afternoon.  YUCK!!!  Besides that, I don't feel very confident with these JC
Whitney CVs I bought for $65 each.  I am doing the lube because I heard the
tiniest clik from one side.  Upon inspection, they look fine.  Who knows how
long they will last.  I only installed them last summer.

Come to think of it, One of the CVs I installed last year self destructed.
 JC Whitney replaced it no charge.  Still don't feel any better about them.

James, could you dig up that 800 number.  I have this sinking feeling I'll
need it.
