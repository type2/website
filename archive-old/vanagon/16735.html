Subject: Re: CV joints

&gt;Although, I've often figured after reading suggestions a couple
&gt;of years ago that swapping joints side to side is good, I really think
&gt;swapping driveshafts could be a big error, after all they have gone
&gt;in your case 15 years being constantly torqued in one direction,
&gt;suddenly changing this could have nasty results IMHO.

Yes, John, I've heard that it is bad to subject the axel to torque back the
other way too.
