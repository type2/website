Subject: '71 Bus For Sale



I'm selling my '71 bus. It's not a westy-- an 8-seat metal-roof non-walk-
through. Tired '70 engine whose story has been chronicled here (details
if you like), runs well but overheats on long trips. New tires (good ones),
new master cyl, nice interior, dent in front, slightly dinged rear bumper,
rust under the windshield. leaks lots of oil. Basically, a rebuilt engine
would make it a whole different car.

No rust except under the windshield (it's bad there), nice white paint
with a few dings and a major dent in the front, very clean and pretty
on the inside with carpeting, padding, soundproofing. AM/FM cassette,
hi-power, four speakers. Extra parts in a box, including a 009, and
a pair of dual Kadrons (used) with all manifolds and linkages.

Anyone have any idea what I should ask for this creature? Email me
privately or via the list if you like...

Thanks in advance...
