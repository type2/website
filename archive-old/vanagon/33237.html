Subject: Re: FF: Buses for Everyone!

Sorry, my luck ran out.  Didn't win the lottery ... :(    Also, there is 
too much ice on the roads to go pick up the 23-Window Deluxe.  I'm hoping 
for a possible clearing of the roads by Sunday.  I'll let y'all know what 
I find when I finally see the Bus.  Later ...
