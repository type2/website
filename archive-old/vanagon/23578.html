Subject: Re: Wolfram Grey Metallic

&gt;&gt;Anyone on the list with Wolfram Grey Metallic paint, such as would come on a
&gt;&gt;late model Vanagon. I have paint for this you can have cheap!
&gt;
&gt;Derek, got a paint code for this stuff, my '87 is a light silver grey, is 
&gt;this Wolfram? I'll check for its code # tomorrow. Body seams need fixing up! 
&gt; tim s.

Check your paint code. If your grey is light silver it probably isn't the
right color as Wolfram Grey Metallic is sort of, well, sort of a battleship
color though the metallic gives it a sort of sheen. The paint code is LH7V.
