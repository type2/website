Subject: Brand new free Leaky rear heater


Well.  The dealer, with much apology and courtesy, installed a new 
rearheater core for me last Wednesday, no charge.  And much 
to my amazement, it loses coolant as well.  Less 
than the old one (which I kept), maybe a teaspoon in 60 miles.  It 
accumulates on the passenger end of the casing, near the lower
screw, as if it was leaking from that screw or nearby.  Accumulates not on 
the bottom corner, but on the little ledge of molding.  I tightened that 
screw and all the others I could reach, but it still drips a little 
bit.  

If anyone of you is familiar with the installation of these things, and 
has ideas where a leak might result from shoddy installation, please let 
me know.  The valve seems dry, as does the bleeder.  And if anyone knows 
of another source of VW parts in Fairbanks or by mail, I could use that 
info as well.  It might be years before I go near the dealer again.  

Meanwhile, I suppose I'll reinstall the soundproofing and carpet, except 
for the area beneath the heater.  The van is rather noisy without it.  

Thanks,

Chris Wyatt
