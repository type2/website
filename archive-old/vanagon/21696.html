&gt; anyone has any ideas for a horn for my Thing.

Well years back in Oregon I had a nice 5-point rack of horns on my bus.  
Didn't do much for cars, but sure would clear the crosswalk.  
Can you still get longhorns in Texas?


BTW - I also had air horns under the front of the car wired into the 
regular horn.  Worked great (especially at said crosswalks) -- if I 
tapped the horn lightly only the standard VW horn would blow, but if I 
held the horn long enough for the compressor to build up air the horns would 
take over.  And that got noticed.
