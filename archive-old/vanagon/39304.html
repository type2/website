&gt; Howdy, all!  I've lurked long enough and have decided to come out into
&gt; the open!  My name's Jason Smith and I have a 1973 Sportsmobile Camper
&gt; that I've fixed up a bit over the 3-4 years I've owned her.  I had been
&gt; on the list a while back, but I had to unsubscribe when I moved.  It's
&gt; good to be back!
&gt;
&gt; On Jerry Garcia......I always find it amusing that people see my Bus
&gt; and automatically equate it with the Grateful Dead.  I was fortunate
&gt; enough to see the Band in concert just a couple of times before Jerry
&gt; passed away.  If you've never been to a show, it's not something I
&gt; could explain, but those that have will know what an experience it was.
&gt; And this was all without the benefit of a single chemical substance!
&gt; Anyway, sorry to ramble....
&gt;
&gt; On school buses....Claraw_at_aol_dot_com, you mentioned you saw a school bus
&gt; with a VW Bus welded on top?  What show did you see that at?  A good
&gt; friend of mine used to tour in her '63 Kombi and mentioned that school
&gt; bus was quite the setup!  Funny that it pops up again....I hadn't heard
&gt; anything about it in at least a few years!
&gt;
&gt; Toodles,

&gt; I saw the double bus last year in Las Vegas,  it broke down right behind us on the strip.

So in other words, don't do what you just did.

Thanks,
