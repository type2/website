Subject: Re:Safari window shafts etc

Best place in UK to source the safari bits, both NOS and repro, kits or bits
is Karmann Konnection. Phone  England code..702 551766, fax 702 559066.
Ask for Ritchie (the owner) or Julian..they are really helpful, and deal with
overseas all the time. If you contact them please tell them you got their name
via Dave (SSVC) on the Internet - maybe they'll invest in it, though Juls will
have fun keeping the KK crew off the thing! Incidentally they are a bloody
good source of rare and NOS parts for all air cooled VWs. Happy Hunting.
PS Safaris in England are a joke - all that rain - wet bums!
My Bus may be slow, but hell life zips by too fast anyway! Dave :)
