Subject: Re: request for the 'accessory' Westy seat

&gt; Agreed.  You can get a center seat row (short one) out of a Vanagon and
&gt; mount in the area between the rear and front seats.  The short center seat
&gt; mounts on rails and can be removed when not in use.  One think to note is
&gt; that children sitting in the seat have gas valves for the stove at eye level
&gt; so you may want to take them off.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd like to get a center seat for my westy too, but I just haven't had the
&gt; time yet.
&gt; 

	The center two-passenger seat with the flip-down backrests from the 
	Weekender work better in this application than the normal center 
	seat with fixed backrest. I have two of the latter (one is totally 
	unused) left over from my experimentation with seat configurations 
	in Flora, our '85 ex-Westfalia.

	I also have the Westfalia's single (swivel) center bucket mounted 
	in our '86 Jamboree mini-motorhome in the middle behind the driver
	and passenger captain's chairs...
