Subject: Re: Anonymous type II humor

&gt;While poking around N. Conway, NH (a very small Boulder, of sorts, filled with
&gt;many outdoorsy climber/hiker types) I spotted a pea-green, mid-'70's Westy
&gt;parked just off the main drag. On the rear and top left, where the &quot;Westfalia&quot;
&gt;insignia is usually located, the owner had written with black electrial tape;
&gt;&quot;Neverfalia&quot;

In Santa Fe a month ago, parked in front of the Santa Fe railway station, I
saw a bus with &quot;Rastafalia&quot; in place of &quot;Westfalia&quot;.  They did it in the
correct font too!
