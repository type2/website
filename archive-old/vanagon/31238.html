&gt; Hi David,
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the info.  I've seen those at Camping World.  Where/how did you
&gt; install it?

It was easy, just unscrew the regulator from the tank  (reverse thread,
shut the main valve off first), install the gauge, and reinstall the
regulator.  Took me half an hour.  :)

-David
