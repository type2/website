Subject: Burn baby burn!

My new/old 88 westy has a 12 litre or 3 gallon lp gas bottle...  I know 
that this question will depend on it use but how long, with reasonable 
use, can I expect my 12 litre supply to last.  I will be using the fridge 
on propane.  The fridge... another story!  What a drag getting that thing 
to light.  I was getting blisters fropm pumping that &quot;a&quot; dial.  Make a 
long story short, I read some postings on the list and tried them out... 
the thing now works like a charm.  Gotta love the list!

Barry.

88 westy 108k Km!
