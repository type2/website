Subject: Re: Dumb question re: windshield washer reservoir 

Well I got a few responses about putting air into my washer reservoir so I went to 
the corner gas station to try it again.  No luck.  My cap is black with a VW emblem 
and the word HELPHOS.  The middle portion moves in and out a bit.  I assume that 
once you get air pressure into the reservoir that the pressure pushes this thing out 
and forms a seal.  Well I can't get any air through this cap.  I took the cap off 
and tried it with the compressor with no luck.  I can't even blow air through with 
my mouth (yes I washed it first).  Now I know I have a good seal when doing this so 
my question is:  am I missing something simple here.  The PO obviously was able to 
do it since the washers worked and the reservoir was pressurized when I took the cap 
off.
