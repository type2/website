Subject: brake goop
Date: Sun, 8 Jan 95 19:24:44 MST

Awhile ago, we were discussing rebuilding front brake calipers,
and several people mentioned some brake rebuilding lube goop..
A cursory inspection of the FLAPS around the corner turns up
nothing. Could someone suggest a brand name and actual tag
for this goop?

Thanks.
