Open the cover you see in the right of the lower
ASCII and swing it open. Than you will see a small
metal plate from the top which gives the electrical
connection between the wires. Try to pull that
plate out of the plastic case. This is not easy because
it is pushed into the plastic. If the plate is out
you can open the case totally and remove the cables.

I don't like this style of cable connectors, it is
better to use the crimped flat metal connectors
Joel and I described in the previous mails.
