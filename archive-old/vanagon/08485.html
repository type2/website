Subject: Engine transplant operation

I'm in the midst of transplanting the engine from a '78 bus
into my '73 chassis.  It seems like it's taking forever.....

The fuel tank from the donor '78 is in.  All the wiring is
taken care of at this point. I'll have to mount the flywheel
off the '73 to the '78 engine so my starter will work.
The '78 has a 228mm clutch and my '73 has a 205mm clutch so
I had to make a decision there.  My clutch is in great shape
so I'm going to run the 205mm for now.  Mostly because I
don't drive the Westy like a drag racer.

Hopefully I'll have the car back on the road later in the week.
I'll keep y'all posted as to how things are going.
