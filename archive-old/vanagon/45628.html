Subject: Eurovan Rialto Sighting

Hi All,

Last weekend I was driving down I-29 (Omaha to KC) and I came upon on
strange sight--a smallish RV with familiar looking taillights.  While
overtaking the vehicle (I can do that when I drive my 84 Vanagon), the
Florida RV tapered down towards the front revealing its identity:
A Eurovan!!

I was surprised.  The rear wheel base was extended quite a bite, but still
had single wheels.  It was fairly long and had a rear access hatch.
I guess the 5 cyl. motor can handle the load.
