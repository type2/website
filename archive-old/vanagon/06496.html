&gt;Coolant.  If you flush the system with water, and then put coolant in,
&gt;you should expect to put about 2 gallons.  I ended up with a little less
&gt;than two gallons, but I've had to open the system a few times since then
&gt;and have used up the third gallon.

just to be sure we are all understanding things here, i was talking about
the quantity of water AND anti-freeze in the whole system ... and i think
Gerry is saying that you only need to add 2 gallons of pure anti-freeze.
i think the point here is that if you flush the system, there will be water
left in it, and it shouldn't take more than 2 gallons (or so) from the
anti-freeze bottles/jugs/containers to finish filling it up.

unless you start trying to figure the concentration you want. ;)  we run
about 50-50 down here, but up north, you might want to run 60-40 (60 percent
coolant, 40 percent water ... which is what i've always heard was the limit
that you did not want to go past &lt;cause 70-30 didn't do any better than
60-40&gt;) ... which means putting in nearly three gallons of anti-freeze.

&gt;Lastly, there are several 84 and 85 owners on the list who have had their
&gt;vehicles less than a year (I'm one).  We're all learning and LEANING on
&gt;Joel for emotional and philosophical support.

so THAT's why i keep walking like this!!! :)
