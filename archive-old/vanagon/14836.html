&gt; &gt; &gt; IS THERE ANY INTEREST IN AN EASTERN LEG?
&gt; &gt; Iagree, that we should all try to meet in St. Louis, and then go
&gt; &gt; traipsing about the east coast. Perhaps if we could all get together and
&gt; &gt; figure something out. I for one can suggest perhaps driving/camping the
&gt; &gt; Blue Ridge Parkway, or perhaps the Outer Banks...

&gt; 
&gt; Exactly, good idea in fact, the later we start the better for me, if we
&gt; were to do St Louis first at the end of the western peoples leg, then
&gt; reverse my proposed order all the better, in fact this way if a few of
&gt; the wackier die hard westerners wanted to continue on with us instead of
&gt; going back home they would be welcome to do so, so how are we going to
&gt; keep in touch with the list people who don't go, anyone looked into the
&gt; use of modems with cell phones ($$$) just kidding.
&gt; 
I agree with the start in St. Louis, as my early summer is pretty full.
That would be great, perhaps to start there, go up to the northeast ,
and then drive on down south...
