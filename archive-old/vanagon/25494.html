 &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I was looking into this just today.  A comparable product is &quot;Glazing
 &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Paper,&quot; which is used as a roofing compound.  It has the same
 &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;sound-deadening qualities as Dynamat, but it is A LOT cheaper.  It can be
 &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;found at any hardware/roofing store.  Sixty bucks will be enough to do
 &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;most every metal item in your car.  It is easily applied any is durable.
 &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 
 &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;  But what about the smell that usually comes with the use of roofing
 &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;  paper?
 &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 
 &gt; &gt; &gt;The smell isn't that prevalent, since it is self-adhesive and requires
 &gt; no heat.
 &gt; &gt; 
 &gt; &gt;  Ok.. but does it have the same adhesiveness as the Dynamat? And what about
 &gt; &gt;  the thickness of it? How does it compare to the Dynamat?
 &gt; &gt;

 &gt; 
 &gt; Actually, the stuff is hellatiously sticky.  In fact, almost too much so. 
 &gt; It is about an eigth of an inch thick, nearly identical to Dynamat.  The
 &gt; sound deadening quality is definitely comparable to Dynamat.  Given the
 &gt; price difference ($179-Dynamat/$30-Glazing paper), at the least, it is an
 &gt; alternative to consider.
