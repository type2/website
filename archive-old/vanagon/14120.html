&gt;I have an '83 that hesitates and bucks between 35-50 mph. This occurs
&gt;especially around 42-47 mph. The van runs great above and below these speed
&gt;ranges. I really don't know what to expect from good old FI systems. I am
&gt;new to Vanagons but used to most of the older VWs. The feeling I get is that
&gt;I need to &quot;clean out the tank and change the fuel filter and fuel pump.
&gt;Truly I think it appears to be related to the injection some how.

i would definitely do the cheaper stuff first ... replace the fuel filter and
put some good brand premium gas in. see if that helps. if that doesn't help,
and it ALWAYS does it, then you might want to start looking at the fuel
injection ... especially the wiper arm in the air flow meter. but do the
filter/full-tank of premium stuff first.
