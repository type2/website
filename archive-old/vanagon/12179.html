Amusing Story to follow...

So happy as I was with the Van running better than ever not squiting a drop 
of anything
I trucked on down to pick up my S.O. from work. While waiting, I tested the 
heater smelled for noxious vapors and even kicked the tires ( All with new 
pride).

Anyways she came out got in the van shut the door and the engine started to 
sputter and then quit. After many choice words that I will not repeat here 
she asked me if the tank was full &quot;Yes the tank is full.... Oh whoops ( it 
was empty)

(For some reason the third letter of the alphabet insists on being a &quot;d&quot; 
sorry ((commas or periods don't work either)))
