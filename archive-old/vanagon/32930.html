well......  i just dumped my synthetic out!!

I had been running 5-50 syn. in the van this summer and liked it 
(well, i think the engine liked it).  this winter i switched to 5-30 
syn for good cold weather starting and my crankshaft seal started 
leaking.  i drove it about a 1000 miles til it finally drove me crazy 
with worry of contaminating the clutch so i dumped it out and put in 
5-30 dino.  leak *seems* to have disappeared but i haven't taken it 
on a good jaunt to really warm it up.  we'll see.
