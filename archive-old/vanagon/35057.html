So Thom Fitzpatrick says:
&gt; 
&gt; Steve Johnson and I went to look at the '65 single cab today.  He's
&gt; still ambivalent on whether or not to but it.  We need to talk him into
&gt; it.  He's worried about if he should spend the money - pshaw!

A-hem....In all fairness to myself, the reason I'm hemmin' n' hawing is
because in order to make this devine purchase, I have to dip into my
stock which is part of my retirement plan.  Now I know the younger
folks in the crowd can't relate to this too well, but as you get
up there in age, these things come into real good focus and you don't
need glasses to see that your going to need some kind of nest egg
to get you through the last quarter or even third of your life.  And
I have to consider that it's my wifes money too.  Thom is a single
guy and can make his own decisions 100%.  So before you go off and
verbally beat me to death, think about the complete picture.

Other than that, if that van is still there by next weekend, it's 
mine!  ;)  I have to get *some* sleep at night ya know?  ;)


BTW, I could believe what Thom was practically stealing from this
guy!
