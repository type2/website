Subject: Re: Later breadloafs with Type I engine

&gt;  Could someone, perhaps one of the UK listmembers, who is familiar with
&gt;  how the upright fan engine is installed in the '72 and later bay window
&gt;  please describe the mounting arrangement? Does the plate behind the engine
&gt;  still remove? What sort of engine bearer/crossmember is there? Are there
&gt;  mounts on the bellhousing like on the type IV engine? 

I have a '73 with a 1600 type 1 engine. Now as far as I know, everything bar 
the engine is the same as the 2 litre version of the same year (i.e. the 
panel below the engine lid is fixed), although the US spec model may well be 
different. Possibly the gear ratios were different as well, but my manual 
only covers 1600 models so I can't be sure. The engine mounts to the gearbox 
with two bolts at the top and two studs at the bottom, same as in the 
earlier bus. There is no rear (R is R) gearbox mount, just one at the nose 
cone. At the rear of the engine, a plate bolts to two bosses on the 
crankcase and carries a crossmember (about 1 inch square tube) that hangs 
from rubber mounts on each chassis rail, just ahead of the bumper mounts. 
The tinware is the same as a bug except for the bit that goes around the 
crank pulley. It has a raised bit on the left to meet up with the body. It 
is an easy swap to fit a type IV engine to one of these buses so you should 
have no trouble doing the swap the other way.
