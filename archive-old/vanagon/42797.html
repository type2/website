Subject: DOT removes gas shocks from HazMat classification


In the latest issue of Underhood Service, they have a news brief that 
the DOT has recended the Hazardous Materials shipping classification 
for gas-pressurized shock absorbers.

So, when the mail order company now tries to nick you $5 per shock 
for a HazMat fee, tell 'em to stick it in their ear.  It WAS a 
legitimate surcharge, now it's just profit.
