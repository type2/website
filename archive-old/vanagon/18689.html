&gt; I recently offered the nose off of my '67 parts Bus to Bill Killian

&gt; Missouri.  He has planned a trip to Ohio and is willing to come to 
&gt; Missouri to pick (up) my nose, however I will be in Maryland that weekend 
&gt; (and he has no tools with which to remove my nose).  If anyone is near 
&gt; West Virginia (or along the route to Ohio), please offer your nose (if 
&gt; you have no use for it) to Bill, as he *really* wants one.

Well gosh...  I didn't expect to see this.  Actually I live in Northern 
Virginia and was going to make a trip to Ohio the first week in July.  
Someone in West Virginia  had found a derelict bus (John I believe) and 
that is how it got started.  I'm sure I have some of the tools necessary 
but not all.  Not even sure what all I would need.  Done almost no 
metalwork but lots of woodwork and even some masonry.

It is nice to see people trying to help each other around cyber-here.
