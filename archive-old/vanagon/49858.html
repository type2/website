Subject: 91 Westy with 3000 miles

Several listmembers have pursued the subject van, which is starting to
sound like a beautiful young lady with a shady past.  There have been at
least two variations on her life story, and there are questions about
how much of the running gear has 3000 miles and how much has ... some
other number.  Still a great deal at some price, although maybe $12,500
isn't that price.  I hope someone buys her, otherwise I have to change
my route to work so she doesn't taunt me every day, beckoning me to
bring lots of money and do something I'll regret.
