&gt;I've read a few msgs off this list recently which made mention of an entity
&gt;called 'Berg'.  Confusing thing is, Berg has been referred to as 'Berg says
&gt;this' and also 'Berg has this' - is Berg a manual, a shop, a parts house, a
&gt;real person, or what?

I think they are referring to Gene Berge, Muir's heir apparent.
