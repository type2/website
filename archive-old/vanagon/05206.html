Well, since it is so quiet, and the T-1 lines are down to my
remote sites.....  I'll post a question.
I just noticed the odometer on my 73 bus has decided enough is
enough.  The speedometer is working properly, so I would like
someone to confirm my suspicion that the problem is in the
gauge.
This problem isn't super critical since the bus has over 200,000
miles on it anyway. 
Does anyone have a correct VDO speedometer?, or have current
pricing information?

those horizontally opposed engines.  I'll have to get a BMW
R100, and a Porsche next.
