&gt;
&gt;First, congrats to our more southerly bretheren for putting together
&gt;a meet in North Carolina.
&gt;
&gt;However, NC is a bit too far for me to travel for a weekend, and
&gt;I suspect others up here in NE. So.....
&gt;howabout the handfull of us up here, anyone interested in getting
&gt;together?
&gt;
&gt;


Anyone got any thoughts about Stowe, Vermont? There is a winter campsite 
there, Nichols Lodge + Campsite, plug-in electrics + heated washrooms! It's 
also the cheapest 'hotel' near Stowe, for those who care. I get a break 
March 6-10, Brrrr. Great playground (mini-city) and sliding hill for kids in 
town. Lots of skiing nearby. Or try making it through Smugglers Notch for 
the Synchro challenge, normally closed Dec.-April. For those of you who 
don't ski, Ben and Gerry's Ice Cream Factory is very handy, gives 
tours/samples and sells factory seconds, yum! Stowe is an old ski town, 
small but active (there's bars in them there hills, hiccup).    tim s.

p.s. for them who don't know, Vermont is near New Hampshire, whose state 
liquor taxes are zero! A boon for fighting the cold.
