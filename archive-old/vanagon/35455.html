So Martha says:
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks Dave, for making that informative post about your two suggested
&gt; places for our camping trip next weekend.  I liked both, rather preferring
&gt; the remoteness you described in the Long Valley site.  

What, that GD Schwarzmeister is schlepping out of this???  So who all
is coming from the Southern portion to this rickety State???

&gt; HOWEVER, if it turns out that you will not be able to accompany us, I'd
&gt; vote for saving Long Valley for a time when you do, and choosing
&gt; Peppermint instead.  One other vote has come in in the same direction.

I vote for the lower elevation as my wifes sleeping bag isn't good 
enough for the extreme cold..
&gt; 
&gt; food:  I originally had in mind to suggest doing German food, but
&gt; Linda Johnson tell me Steve started making faces (pickled figs to
&gt; you, buster!  :), so am revising this at Bradley's suggestion, to
&gt; be:  &quot;international&quot; cuisine.  Howzzat?

Danke...  ;)

I only told Linda that the only German food I like is beer.  :)
