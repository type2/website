&gt;Once I saw a worker in his auto battery shop testing a fully charged brand
&gt;new car battery. I did not see him pulling a meter or tester anything like
&gt;that. Instead he hooked up one end of a jumper to one end of the battery.
&gt;The jumper is the kind we use when our cars do not go and had to beg others
&gt;to give us a jump start, you know what I am talking about.
&gt;
&gt;The guy grabed the other end and hit the other end of the battery. It's like
&gt;a thunder in front of you, a momentary white out. Before I realized what
&gt;happened he disconnected the jumper and picked that battery for a sale to
&gt;a customer.

Sounds like somethin' a VW Dealership would do :-)
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHH!
