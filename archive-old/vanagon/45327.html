&gt;Is it just me or does Lance Garner (who is leaning agianst his &quot;1961 Panel
&gt;&lt;- obligatory VW reference) who is pictured on page 3 of the most recent
&gt;Old Bus Review having more than a passing resemblance to ole Unca Joel of
&gt;V_at_L fame?

it's a lie! a bald-faced shameless lie! my mother NEVER even knew anyone
named Garner!!!  ... and i never drove a 61 panel. or page 3. or reviewed
any old buses. ...well, there was that busty little number down in Tiajuana
... but that was a long time ago!!
