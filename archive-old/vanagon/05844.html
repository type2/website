Ric, I believe (but cannot verify) that VW  created the ad for a run in
various mags of the time (LIFE etc) after Chapaquidick (sp?). The
argument being that had Kennedy owned a bug with its excellent floating
properties (remember how hard it was to close bug doors because of the
great sealing properties?) then he would not been in that mess  and so on
and so on and would have become president .....Lampoon may have &quot;borrowed&quot;
the idea, no? DC
