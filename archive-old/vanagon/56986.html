Subject: Preventing (or delaying) head leaks

Does anyone have any tips on delaying the head corrosion that eventually 
results in leaks on the wasserboxers?  I have read conflicting things 
about the VW antifreeze, and about the problems caused by phosphate.  I'm 
inclined to go with the theory that phosphate is good, unless you have 
hard water, and fill it with Prestone and distilled water.
