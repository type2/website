Subject: 85 Vanagon-Rebuilt engine or new heads?


I wanted to thank everyone for your help on my leaking heads problem.

One of you guys made me think about the future of my relationship with my 
Vanagon.  It has 140K mi and the heads are beginning to leak.  The VW dealer 
is telling me $850 to replace both of the heads but I'm wondering if 
getting a rebuilt engine is a better way to go.  Also, two other things:
1-How much will I be looking at for a rebuilt wasserboxer?
2-Any reputable VW mechanics in the Capital District area (Albany,NY)?

Thanx again,
Nate El Great
