Subject: RE: 65 UnEarthing - how/where to attach drag chain?


&gt;a 65 Camper next saturday :), not sure if its a westy, and
&gt;its been sitting for 8 years at the bottom of a sunken driveway [basement
&gt;level garage, lower than street...].
&gt;   &lt;snip&gt;
&gt;aid in the extraction from the rust pit [eight
&gt;years of accumulated leaves have created SOIL!].
&gt;
&gt;The existing tires have cracks the size of the Grand Canyon......
&gt;
&gt;There is a mouse nest in one of the drawers.......
&gt;
&gt;But boy oh boy does it have restoration potential!!!!


Gee... sounds in &quot;GOOD CONDITION&quot; to me!!!   :^)

Haven't towed a splittie backwards before. Always had the opportunity to
tow forward, of course, wrapping the tow chain around the front torsion
bars, but obviously that's not possible here.

Not knowing anything else, I'd first clear out most of the topsoil with a
shovel and hoe, then slide underneath and pull a long chain or snatch
strap all the way to the front of the bus, and wrap it around the front
torsion bars anyway. Careful not to wrap it around the sway bar or tie
rods, tho! Watch the brake lines, too... This should let you get it out
of &quot;The Pit&quot;, and up onto level ground where you can do it right.
Good luck!
