Subject: shifter bushing/boot inventory (splittie)

Hi folks,

Like many buses, mine has seen casual maintenence.  I've been rooting
around my shift rod trying to figure out which parts are missing or just
need to be replaced.  Here's what I think is going on between the
base of the gearshift lever and the front of the tranny, please let
me know if I've left anything out.  The bus is a '62.

(front of shift rod)
     |
bushing shaped like a skirt
     |
little coupler with one screw
     |
enters tube, boot with ridges
     |
exits tube, another boot?
     |
rear coupler with two screws
     |
tranny nose (another boot here?)

I can't quite reconcile what I have with the pictures in my
Wolfsburg West catalog, so any info you splittie gurus can
give me would be appreciated.  Is there a second bushing somewhere?

Thanks in advance,

Mark
