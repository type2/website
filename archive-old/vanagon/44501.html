Subject: These could be the tires (Retry)


hey joel and volks,

joel mentioned to me that he was leaning to the michelin XCH light truck 
tires....i went shopping around today and found out that michelin doesn't 
carry the xch's anymore but that the michelin MX4 replaces them. this si 
an 185/70r14 double sidewall reinforced tire. light truck. i went to 
NTW (National Tire Wholesale) and got a GREAT price quoted on them.

first, western auto quoted me $88 a tire. NTW quoted me $71.78 a tire.
the breakdown is as follows:

287.12  4 Michelin 185/70r14 mx4 tires
45.96   installation w/lifetime balance
5.76    2% Scrap tire disposal tax
28.02   extened warranty	
17.23   sales tax
-----
384.09 total

not bad i don't think, good tire....reinforced sidewalls...any comments?

jonathan
