&gt; &gt; If someone would bring a pictionary game, they're real fun for groups of
&gt; &gt; people for after dinner fun.  We don't have one because usually someone
&gt; &gt; else in the family has one.

&gt; Funny you should mention that, Steve.  I just bought one at a garage sale
&gt; for $2.  I'll bring it.  :)
