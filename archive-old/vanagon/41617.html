Subject: Thanks and more ?'s

        Salutations all, just wanted to thank everyone who answered all my
piddly little questions so quickly in regards to the rear wiper, extra
battery, and the mysterious silver dash plug. I've sent away for a catalog
of whats available for the plug-in so Ill keep you posted if theres
anything interesting.
        Hmmm...oh. Im working on this multimedia project right now and we
needed some underwater images. So I was looking through a Corel photo CD on
underwater life when I came across a photo of an old VW van that sunk, and
has become a rather nice place for coral to hang out. It looks to be a
70's, although its hard to tell with all the fish around it.

        On with the questions:
1) If I notice a small paint chip or ding, whats the best preventitive
measure to take in regards to preventing rust?
2) What sort of mileage should an '83 Westfalia be getting.....ideally? :)
