Subject: Prices 86 wheel bearings

Thanks for the quick response on rear wheel bearing suggestions.

My local FLAPS (new acronym for me) estimates $60 for a set (inner,
outer, and two seals).  His suggested retail was $136.  I never did call
the VW dealer.  They will be in on Weds.  Buying the socket to get the nut
off might be almost as expensive!!!
