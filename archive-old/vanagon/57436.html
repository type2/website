&gt;      Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt;      My digital clock between the speedometer and odometer is no longer
&gt;      backlit when I have my headlights on. Does anyone has any experience
&gt;      fixing this?
&gt; 
&gt;      In addition, the station preset lights on my VW Design am/fm/cassette
&gt;      radio also no longer light up when the headlights are on. I originally
&gt;      thought the LED's were bad, but another VW Design radio did the same
&gt;      thing.
&gt; 
&gt;      Are these two situations related? Any help would be appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt;      TIA,
&gt;
