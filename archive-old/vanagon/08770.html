&gt; Nora's freezin' on the trolley, fa la, la la, la la la.
&gt; Does any one remember the words?
&gt;DC

Deck us all with Boston Charlie,
Walla Walla, Wash., and Kalamazoo ...
Nora's freezin' on the Trolley,
Swaller dollar Cauliflower Alley-ga-roo!

Don't we know Archaic Barrel,
Lullaby Lilla Boy, Louisville Lou!
Trolley Molly don't love Harold,
Boola Boola Pensacoola Hul-la-ba-loo!

then, of course, there was always:

Oh, Good King Sauerkraut looked out
On his feets uneven ...           ;)

&lt;but they never printed the rest of the words&gt;

Happy Boxing Day, y'all ;)
