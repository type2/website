Subject: VW Classic in Irvine, CA

I arrived at the Irvine Meadows Amphetheater around 10:am. There was 
no line getting in to pay the $12 admission fee.  Parked the car under 
the light pole #2 (&quot;dos&quot; in spanish) we always parked there for the 
Grateful Dead concerts played in the 1980's.  We never lost a car :)

As soon as I got in the gates I noticed a small collection of early
busses.  There was an ambulance, 2 fire trucks with ladders and one
fire truck with a hose pump, a barn-door deluxe micro, a barn-door
panel van in red and green, a split-screen bus with a huge square
van body on it's back and a white high-roof bus. I oohed and aahhed 
over these for a long while and decided to save some film for the rest
of the show.

There was a stage with live surf music pumping out and nearby were a 
couple of cars I photo'd were a '46 beetle and one of those things 
made by  Westfalia for a european postal service (that looks like a 
cross  between a Type3 and a bus) I forget the actual name.

Cars were sorted in the show - Buggies, Beetles, Type3s, Ghias, Things,
Hey what are the busses doing all the way at the back along the fence?
I went to investigate and found a double cab with a Porsche 6cyl and
air.  A Vanagon single cab, Vanagon double cab and Vanagon double cab
Syncro.  Next to the single cab was none other than our own Rusty Van
Bondo and his '91 Westfalia.  I knew that net.shirt would come in handy
'cause later in the day I was also spotted by Lisa and Risto.  Thanks
for the shirt Richard, it really works.

There were'nt too many early bay-window campers like mine.  Some of the
cars in the show looked really rough.  I may enter mine next year since
it seems they let semi-beaters in. There was a beige bay-window camper 
with a Devon pop-top and a split window Devon that had a tent on the side.  
The one with the tent was in immaculate condition.  I wonder if it had 
ever _really_ been camped in. On the way out I snapped a few more photos 
of a Kubelwagen and a couple of Rometsch cars.  BTW, I'll be bringing the
photos to Sequoia this weekend for the CCC gathering.
