Subject: Re: Skylight Bug Screen

I was planning on using &quot;Krazy Glue&quot; on mine. I have tried many other products
with mixed and limited success. This is my third Westy with the problem of
needing to be re-glued! guess its just a &quot;maintenance&quot; thing!

Anyone ever tried &quot;Krazy Glue&quot;? It's so caustic/permanent for your skin that
I really am aprehensive about its use.

&gt; 
&gt; well, on the subject of glue i have a recommendation.
&gt; 
&gt; available from shoe stores is a brand of contact cement called barge
&gt; cement.  This stuff is used to glue rubber to leather, or any two porous
&gt; or nonporous surfaces together.  It sticks VERY well.
&gt; 
&gt; might be worth considering, it worked great on my rock climbing shoes, but
&gt; i cannot give any testimony as to its uses with velcro.
&gt; 
&gt; peace,
&gt; 
&gt; Steve
