 My van turn about 3700 rpm at 100 km/h (or 60 miles/h), I think that's a
 little too much. Is that right?

I'm hitting 4000 rpm at 72 mph

I'm asking me about the rpm of my van. 

Would you give me your rpm of your van if

--- he got a automatic transmission
--- when you drive at 100 km/h (or 60 miles/h)
--- it's a westfalia whit all the kit....

My van turn about 3700 rpm at 100 km/h (or 60 miles/h), I think that's a
little too much. Is that right?

Thanks,
