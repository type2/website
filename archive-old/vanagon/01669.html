Subject: listserv configuration change.

I've recompiled the listprocessor software to delete bad addresses 
after 7 days.  This function has been turned off up to now, and I've 
been dealing with it manually.  Since I'm going to be gone for 3 
weeks, I have to make as many things automatic as I can.
If it causes anyone grief please write to me immediately.

Just keeping you up to date.
