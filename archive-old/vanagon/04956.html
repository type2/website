&gt; &gt;...          Also, I propose that we adopt &quot;UrineVan&quot; as the list-approved
&gt; &gt;slang for the latest generation of bus.  Good one, Wizzer!
&gt; 
&gt; now, now, children. :)  as much as i like a good phrase, i'm afraid that the
&gt; Urinevan name just doesn't fit. all the other nicknames (split-window,
&gt; bread-loaf/bay-window, brick) refer to an external feature or the shape of
&gt; the bus. besides ... EuroVans don't come in yellow in this country. ;)

	I agree. 

	Trashing brandnames is a habit I picked up working with bicycle
	mechanics who tended to be arrogant and had plenty time to gab
	as their job is play to them.
