&gt; well, i haven't found one yet...short of applying heat and fusing the damn 
&gt; thing to the OEM carpet underneath, about the only other thing I can think
&gt; of is to apply velcro strips to the bottom and stomp on that sucker!

&gt; eagerly awaiting fixes to this incredibly technical problem w/ EVs   ;-)

Strange how much certain sects here whine about EVs when our technical 
problems of late have been humps in rugs and rattling tables...

I don't have much of this problem.  Got the MV so it wold involve jump 
seats not second and third row...

The carpet does side forward sometimes but don't get a hump.  You also 
say OEM carpet.  Are your mats non-VW?  Mine are.  Might be able to put 
an eyelet in the corners and attach a matching hoo to the appropriate 
close item  Maybe even the installed carpet if you can find the right 
kind of hook (what ever that might be.  Just a thought...
