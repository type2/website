Subject:      Re: Volkstoberfest on Sunday in Morgantown, PA

&gt; All,
&gt; [Apologies if this has been posted already]
&gt;
&gt; This came from the VW Club...
&gt;
&gt; The Volkstoberfest is in Morgantown, PA on Sunday, October 12, 1997, 9am
&gt; to 3pm.
&gt;
&gt; 1) 30 classes of show cars on display
&gt; 2) Autocross
&gt; 3) Indoor new and used car display
&gt; 4) Swap meet area
&gt; 5) Toy and literature vendors
&gt; 6) Kidsports Kid Activity Area
&gt; 7) '98 Passat on display (no mention of the '98 Bug--sigh)
&gt;
&gt; Sounds like the usual stuff, but it seems to be a sizable show....
&gt;
&gt; Location: The Home Furnishings and Outlet Mall [which from the directions
&gt; seems to be located at the intersection of PA routes 10 and 23, near PA
&gt; Turnpike exit 22, a few miles west of Philly]
&gt;
&gt; For more info call 1-800-DRIVE-VW


This is located at what used to be the Manufacturers Outlet Mall (M.O.M.),
directly off of the Morgantown exit of the Pa. turnpike (between Philly and
Reading).  Same general area as June's Maple Grove, Pa. show, but much more
accessable to the Turnpike (actually visable from the Turnpike).  This is
the first year for this show, and I'm pretty sure it's the last VW show in
this area 'til Spring.  I've been debating on whether to set up there.  On
one hand, it's only about 1/2 hour away from my shop, on the other hand I'm
so busy.  Are many of you planning on going?
