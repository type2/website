&gt; I'll add another question to this note.
&gt; 
&gt; My temperature control levers are not lit up, so it's hard to see what the 
&gt; temperature controls are set at, when driving at night.  One of the two fan 
&gt; control dials is lit up.  What else is supposed to be lit up on an 84 
&gt; vanagon?  Are the temp control levers lit up?
&gt; 

There is a wee peanut bulb fitted to the plastic behind the heater 
levers. Pull off the fan knobs and the heater knobs and carefully pry the 
control faceplate from the dash. The light should be obvious.
Grab handfulls of those tiny bulbs when at the wreckers ;)
