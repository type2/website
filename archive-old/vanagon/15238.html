&gt; Yeah I remember these, drove with one hanging off the front of an old

&gt; was simply heavy coarse canvas, several layers. You soak them overnight, 
&gt; then fill and hang in the breeze. Get one made, use part of the filler neck 
&gt; from a wine box (quality no less) and stitch it all together.

If this is really what you mean Martha, I have seen them for sale here in
Victoria.
