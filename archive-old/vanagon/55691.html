Dave,

I have had some experience before with something like this.  I spent about
$400.00 with my dealer before I fixed it.

My '86 would always stall taking right hand turns and mis-fire on rough
roads going straight.  The ECU under the back seat was shorting against its
mounting bracket.  All I did was insert a small sheet of cardboard between
the ECU and bracket and no more misses.  I hope this is the problem because
it's the best kind to fix (easy and cheap!!).

PS. My '91 has a plastic part between the ECU and bracket.
