Subject: Re: Should I buy?

&gt;We are in the process of looking at an 83 Westfalia Vanagon L.  At the 
&gt;moment we don't know that much about it and have scheduled an 
&gt;inspection to check everything out.  What we could see from looking at 
&gt;it was that there was a small amount of minor surface rust and the 
&gt;interior looked lovingly used.  We did have a chance to start it, and 
&gt;it fired right up, but since it was rush hour, I decided it might not 
&gt;be a good time to learn where the gears are.
&gt;Here's the deal, 
&gt;1) it has 200,000 on the odometer
&gt;2) it was bought wholesale by this little lot, so we don't know the 
&gt;owner history (engine history)
&gt;3) quoted price, $2,500
&gt;4) we have never owned or driven a camper van, and we have only been 
&gt;following this listserve for a short while, so we don't know what 
&gt;common quirks and problems are inherent with these campers
&gt;
&gt;I think this is a pretty good deal and if the timing were better I 
&gt;would probably blindly drive it away today (we need to fix our roof, 
&gt;not buy another vehicle).  I have always wanted a camper and fear that 
&gt;if I wait, I might have troubles finding one I can afford.  Any advice 
&gt;might help me make a more confident decision.  As soon as I know trhe 
&gt;condition of the mechanicles, I will post for more advise.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks

 This might help you some. According to the &quot;Old Cars Price Guide&quot;, if the
vehicle is totally operational showing wear the value is around $3800 (i.e.
an older restoration). You mention they bought it wholesale. They are in the
business of making money so, they are making money at the price that you
list. The next lower bracket is $1900 which should be a vehicle needing no
work or very little work to become totally operational. Judging by these
figures, you would have between $1900 and $3800 to play. These figures are
approximates according to the &quot;Guide.&quot;

 I have a 1982 but it is automatic. I like it very much and has not given me
major problems. The only problem I had was a valve cover leak and just put
two. With the third one, I followed the advice of the very nice listees and
glued the sucker. No more leaks. Gas mileage is about 20mph in the city. A
good set of tires and proper tire inflation helped raise it a little but I
haven't driven it that much lately and haven't kept accurate readings of the
gallons, etc.

 Do check for rust in the back lower corners. Most of the water hits those
parts more than the others for some reason. After driving in the rain or
getting it wet by puddles or other miscellaneous liquids, it gets washed and
polymer coated. No sense in wasting the Beauty to rust or other strange
chemicals. I drive it, I take care of it, as well.

 There is one thing that I should warn you about. Be ready for high prices
in parts and engine labor. So, if you decide to get one, treat it very
nicely and maintain it properly. I've had mine for almost 5 years, consider
it my daily driver and love it to death. So does my wife and so do my children.

 Anecdote: I told the family I was considering selling Wilma (the van) and
they all looked at me like I was crazy and my kids didn't speak to me for a
few hours. My wife was actually angry and gave me a sermon/nagging that I
won't forget for a while. No..I won't sell it. I want to live to enjoy my 56.
