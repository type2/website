OK,

	Just got back from Bug O Rama, and boy did I have fun!

	Got to watch some poor guy eat the guard rail on the drag strip.

	Got to see quite a few nice busses.  Not as many as I expected, tho.

	Picked up (FINALY) a set of bubble lights for my bus.  $180!  There
was another set a guy had for sale but he wanted $300!  There as also a
set of early-early flat lenses, with the same no-screws style as the 
bubbles, for $150.  I figure it was worth it for $30 extra bucks to get
the bubbles.   One guy also had a complete NOS 3rd brake light, all of the
pieces, for $100.  Sorry, but I was out of cash by then.
	
	$24 bucks for me and my sweetie to get in.  OUCH!  All of the posters
say $10/head - hmmm....

	Anyway, overall I was a little disappointed - I expected a lot more 
people, although I got there just before 10 am and left about 12:30, and
some of the vendors were also packing up already!

	There was a booth selling Fukengrueven stickers for $3 each.  I thought
that was a little high, and on top of it, I forgot to actually get one...
Head shop time, I guess.

Well, I guess my baby is one step close to completion.  I'm still having a
hard time finding that deck lid and bumpers.  There were bumpers there, but
they were absolutely shot!

Anybody need 57-63 taillights?  Got some I don't need now!
