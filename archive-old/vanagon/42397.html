Subject: 86 Vanagon needs more help  : ' (

Hi! I have an 86 Westy which stiiiilll won't run right. I've had three 
shops (including two dealers) each tell me different causes for a rough 
idle. The responses have included :

It needs a new ECU
It is probably a sticking fuel injector
It is usually not the ECU, it's most likely in the wiring harness.

I sure would appreciate recommendations for a GOOD mechanic shop with 
electrical experience.

Also, I am not driving the van at the moment because of a blinking oil 
pressure light. The oil level and coolant both appear to be at the 
correct level. Any suggestions?

Thanks in advance for your responses :)

ps I would be willing to tow the van anywhere in the near to Dallas 
area if it would get it running right.

Regards, Vance
