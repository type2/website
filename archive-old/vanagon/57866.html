Hi All: I would do a CV joint service/inspection,and if your wheel
bearings havn't been serviced if may be a good time. Last year when we
were headed to Inuvik Canada we lost a front wheel bearing and were
lucky to be within 300 miles of service. We limped in, but it was noisy
all the way and it made me worry that it was giong to completely let go
and leave us stranded. I had 138,000 miles on the syncro when it went.
The bearing that went was sealed so I couldn't service them before we
left home.
