So William Abbott says:
&gt; 
&gt; 	My sainted mother got front-ended in our '68 and no one
&gt; in our vehicle was injured- someone pointed out that most cars
&gt; are lower than your bus, and this is a very good point. Hit

That was me....
&gt; a Honda with your bus and the odds are you'll slide over its
&gt; hood. I wouldn't want to be in the Honda...


&gt; 	I've seen, and my brother has, pictures that a Swedish
&gt; magazine did of a Vanagon and a Volvo station wagon in an offset
&gt; front end collision. The Vanagon rode up over the hood of the
&gt; Volvo and stove-in its front windshield. Both cars were instrumented
&gt; and had dummies in them- the dummies in the VW were ok...

Hmmm..... did the dummies actually say they were ok... ;)
