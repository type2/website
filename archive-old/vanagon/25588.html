Subject: Re: Overloading the alternator

You may be referring to my post. It was from a Bosche starter manual saying
that their starters were meant to operate at a low voltage--like 8 volts or
something--and too large of a battery could fight the voltage drop that
normally occurrs and burn out the starter by supplying higher voltage--like
11 volts or something.

&gt;
&gt;A while ago, there was a thread on batteries, and someone suggested that
&gt;having too large of a battery could hurt the alternator.  I'm sure it
&gt;could be found in the archives.
