Subject: Re: Q on converting bus to a camper

brad:

probably the most difficult part of the conversion will be the big hole you
have to cut in the roof, plus installing the pop top.

I'm not sure if they had it in 70' but a lot of the Westy's had a belly pan
on the underside to reinforce the strenth of the van, since it had a 4 foot
hole in the roof. I'm not sure if this pan is welded, bolted or what. It
shouldn't be too dificult to fit the interior in though, if you wanted to
skip installing  the pop-top though.

&gt;Hello all.  Any ideas on how hard it would be to convert a regular bus to a
&gt;camper bus.  I want to convert my 69 to a camper.  I've found an old rusty 70
&gt;westfalia for parts.  Is it possible, and economical to do this.  Any Ideas
&gt;what a good price is to pay for the camper interior.  Another question would be
&gt;, if I remember right 71 was the year for some changes in mechanical aspect of
&gt;the bus, so are 69 and 70 parts for the most part interchangeable, incase I
&gt;have to buy a whole bus.
&gt;Thanks
&gt;Brad
