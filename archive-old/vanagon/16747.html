Subject: Need advice: where to buy longblock


My '76 Westy (2L FI) has never run exactly right.
A friend just opened a garage and agreed to let me use his space and give 
me guidance to take out the engine and find the problem(s).
Well, the engine is now completely disassembled and the bad news is:
need new clutch, 1 head can be reworked, 1 head needs replacing, 2 piston 
heads are toasted, the cam shaft is worn out.  The case had some clear 
silicon-like stuff over some holes (oil galleys?).
My friend and I discussed all the above items and agreed that the better 
decision may be to buy an assembled longblock that I could get a warranty 
with and have more faith in than try to piece this engine back together.

So, one company he had heard of is GEX.  I called them and they quoted me 
$1514 for a longblock.  This includes $95 shipping from CA to NC and $300 
that I may get back on core charge.

I see other ads in VW Trends and DB&amp;Hot VWs.  Some are priced lower, some 
higher.

So, any net.wisdom on where to buy would be appreciated.

PS- another friend said take this opportunity to put in an 1800 instead 
of the 2000 - said I'd save a lot in parts later.  Would this be a 
plug-and-play thing, or require other work also?

I'm not giving up!  I love VWs and especially my bus.  I'm looking at 
this as a great opportunity - I've got free shop space and mechanic 
advice!  I've learned so much already while taking this engine out and apart.
My goal is to be self supporting.  Able to get in the bus and take off on 
a long trip without worrying that I will have some problem and not be 
able to fix it.

Peace to all,
-gary
