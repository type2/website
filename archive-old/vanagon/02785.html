&gt;Is this list available in a one-a-day digest format?  If so I would
&gt;like to receive it that way.  I would have mailed this to you only,
&gt;Joel, but I can't seem to find your address.  Thanks.

no problem. you are now set to Digest format. :)  anybody else that wants
it, i have The Power (heheheheheheheheheheeheh) to set you Free!!! :)

&gt;Another good possibility might be an INDEX format.  Another active list I am

this kind of stuff will have to wait until Gerry gets back ... i'm only the
little Mickey Mouse Sorcerer's Apprentice. :)   but it sounds like a good
idea (yeah! more work for gerry!).

&gt;I apologize to list members not interested in this meta, but we might
&gt;preserve the participation of some members who just can't deal with *all*
&gt;the mail.

yup. that's what the list is for: spreading 'information' around. and not
everybody likes their information in the same format. i would wish that
all the buses out there would like to be on this (or some other) list, but
hey! bus people are different, too. :)  right now, only about half of all
the microbuses/buses/vanagons/eurovans that i know of are on our list ...
and that's not too bad. some will be back when schools start back up ...
maybe. :)

anyway, what i'm bumping around about is that if you don't like something,
speak up! maybe we can change it. and what you get out of a list like this
is what you put into it. :)

ok, mom. i'm through now. :)
