I did the same thing on my 86 cause it was stalling when cold.  I talked
to my mechanic when I took it in for inspection and he recommended I
check the throttle valve.  I adjusted the throttle valve to make the gap
larger. I also adjusted the idle speed to about 910-920 RPMs from about
880-900.  So far so good.

I have to get my new dyno mega gizmo emmissions test any day now, I hope
they let me watch.

&gt; Well, i replaced the blue temp sensor (finally) expecting the roughness
&gt; to disappear when i start up the van (84 westy), but it didn't.
