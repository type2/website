Subject: This may not work

But I'm going to take a guess that it will work based on the other
listproc mailers I am on.

Hi!  I just subscribed today, and thought I would take some time to
introduce myself before I start pumping you all for information about my
ailing aquisition.

Name: Squid Hartha aka Squido aka Christian Owens
Occupation:  Microsoft drone
Preffered Locomotion:  Sport Bikes
Rational Locomotion:  Recently aquired '83 VW Vanagon.

Why did I subscribe:
Cause someone on this list better know more about horizontally opposed 4
cylindar fuel injected engines than I do.  I know normally aspirated
in-line 4s stuffed into small chassix with 2 wheels, purpose built to go
REALLY fast.

And if someone like this does really exist, well I need to pick you
brain cause my Vanagon is acting weird.  I talk to it real nice and
stuff, I encourage it to go, and it still doesn't always pay attention
when I ask it to do things.

So I need a mentor, and hey, I hang out with leather clad speed junkies,
but I suppose cruising around in mini bagos and camping could be just as
much fun as trying to see just how quickly I can get from Home to work
at 6:00 a.m.

More on my bad VW when I start getting messages back from the list

Squido
