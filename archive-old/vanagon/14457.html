Subject: Re: Later breadloafs with Type I engine

&gt;  Could someone, perhaps one of the UK listmembers, who is familiar with
&gt;  how the upright fan engine is installed in the '72 and later bay window
&gt;  please describe the mounting arrangement? Does the plate behind the engine
&gt;  still remove? What sort of engine bearer/crossmember is there? Are there
&gt;  mounts on the bellhousing like on the type IV engine? 

I have seen 1972-1975 Buses with the Type I engine.  The important thing to
consider is that the transaxle be the same as for the 1968-1971 Buses. 
1976+ buses have a different transaxle.

You have to make new engine tin to seal off the engine compartment around
the engine.  I've seen people use ordinary sheet metal, cut to size, and
sealed with rubber roofing material.
