Subject: Re: Dave Black! Jim Brill! Westy parts catalog cometh!

I must confess I am a total fan of having people put classifieds on our
discussion group! Here in Toronto, we won't see HVW's for another 2 weeks.
By that time even if I wanted to buy something, it will be sold.I really
appreciate seeing the ad's.




&gt;I need Dave Black and Jim Brill's snail-mail addresses.  I have pat
&gt;Walsh's and ROn Van Ness's.  Need Michael Heron's, too.  Sorry.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone have info on the Franklin Mint microbus deluxe?  I heard about it
&gt;on r.a.vw but nothing concrete. Now the latest DB&amp;HVWs mentions it.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;From DBHVWs classifieds:
&gt;
&gt; 1968 - 79 Westphailia Tent new, $600.  (516) 221-4083
&gt;
&gt; 1966 Westfalia with rare side awning.  Daily driver, rebuilt motor and
&gt;brakes, 12, NEW Michelins, child's cot, MINT interior! Drive home today.
&gt;Sacrifice, $4,500! Scott Gaillard, 2211 Welcome, Williamston, SC 29697,
&gt;(803) 261-7105.
&gt;
&gt; [IMO the &quot;rare&quot; awning dowsn't look factory.]
&gt;
&gt;Tell 'em you saw it on the 'net!
