&gt;	So can you tell me what is the manual besides set up?  Perhaps 
&gt;care of the material? Maby I need a copy too, mine is a 71'.
&gt;Walt.  82 westy 71 2002........................
&gt;

Nope, it doesn't say much about care of the material, except this:

&quot;Remember not to push up from the inside to dislodge water that has
collected. Touching the inside of the tent while it is wet could cause the
tent to leak at the spot. This is perfectly normal with any canvas tent.

Allow the tent to dry thoroughly after it has been wet, before returning
it to the storage bag. In the event you cannot dry it immediately, dry it
out as soon as possible. Air-drying is best, away from any source of
direct heat. Make sure the seams, edges, and all the cloth panels are dry
before packing.

Clean and dry the bottom of the vinyl floor very well before packing the tent.

Don't roll up the stakes and ground pins with the tent, keep them separate
to help prevent mildew.

Stains caused by spills, tree sap or bird droppings can be washed off with
clear water and brown soap. Spot removers or volatile solvents could ruin
the waterproofing and color of your tent.&quot;


The booklet mentions 2 types of tents (I'll paraphrase): one for vehicles
delivered in the USA and Canada; the other for Tourist Delivery vehicles:

1) Campertent -- available in USA and Canada
(short description) 9'6&quot; by 9'6&quot;, seven foot ceiling, 50 lbs.
*Assembly instructions are packed with the tent*

2) Campmobile Tent -- available for Tourist Delivery Vehicles
assembly instructions follow....

Maybe --and I'm just guessing-- that Campertent was made in the USA or
Canada by some other company, which would explain why Westfalia did not
include instructions for that model...

Anyway, if anyone would like a xerox, just send me your snail-mailing
address.
