&gt;&gt; Hi Bob (&amp; Vangoners!!),
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;         I don't know much of anything about watercooled VW's, but the good
&gt;&gt; folks on the Vanagon list do. Before we split into Aircooled and
&gt;&gt; Watercooled lists I used to see all kinds of discussion on these types of
&gt;&gt; issues, so maybe they can be of help to you. I'm cc'ing this to them, but
&gt;&gt; if you check out my web page it has subscription info for the list, and the
&gt;&gt; location of the archives-which go back for several years. Someone somewhere
&gt;&gt; has to know the solution to your problem! Best of luck in finding it...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Eddie,
&gt;
&gt;I don't see your friends email address.  Are we suppose to send our responses
&gt;to you?  Or him?

        The original message was cc'd to &quot;bob tickle&quot;
&lt;ratickle_at_viconet_dot_com&gt;, I seem to remember Vanagon used to show cc's, I
guess this doesn't happen anymore-or I'm going senile early... Sorry folks!

Peace,
