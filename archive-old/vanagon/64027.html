Subject: Tires for 91 westy - options?

       
       
       The choices for tires are sure becoming meager. From the 
       archives, I've gleaned the following popular options for my 
       (new to me) 91 Westy, non-syncro w/alloys:
       
       Michelin MXT 205/70R14
       Reinforced 6-ply
       Approx. $93 in SF Bay Area
       
       Yokohama Y370 LT 195/75R14
       Light Truck 8-ply
       Unavailable in SF Bay Area
       
       The tire dealer said the Yoko Y370 has been replaced by the 
       SD05, otherwise known as the &quot;Super Digger&quot; for $71. The name 
       Super Digger conjures images of an aggressive tread pattern, 
       and howling tire noise on the Interstate as a result. A call 
       to Yokohama HQ to confirm the demise of the Y370, a perennial 
       listserv favorite, has yet to be returned.
       
       The tire dealer said the Y370's 195/75R14 is not the 
       recommended aspect ratio for a top-heavy Westy, and that 
       185/80R14 or 205/70R14 are the only suitable choices. He said 
       he's seen two Westys with the Y370s where the tire had 
       separated. He wasn't too hip on these, as you can surmise.
       
       The only other choice the dealer has available was one I'd 
       never heard of: 
       
       Cooper Signet 185/80SR14
       8-ply
       $63
       
       Has anyone ever heard of this tire brand?
       
       Does anyone know if the Yokohama Y370 is still available? 
       
       Does anyone have any other recommendations that are less 
       expensive, and/or better than the Michelins?
       
       If you respond directly to me, I will gather up the responses 
       and post the findings to the group. 
       
       
       Thanks,
