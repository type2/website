&gt;Michelin MXL Reinforced	205/70R14	6/B/40 		Good
&gt;Sears Trailhandler	?               6/C/50       	Horrid


Just to complicate things (`_~)

Sears Trailhander APT 195/75R14 6/C/50  Good+ (so far) 40k warranty

Why I bought them: They were the most aggressive tread pattern load range C
tires I could track down that would fit the Syncro's stock steel wheels
(the wider alloy wheels give you more options).
