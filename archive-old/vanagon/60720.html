Subject: Re: Oil on the rear window!!!
From: kdlewis_at_juno_dot_com (kenneth d lewis)

The problem I have with this is the owners manual states the top mark is
a &quot;max&quot; reading not an overflow and the lower notch is a &quot;min&quot; mark not
a normal level. The difference between max and min is one quart. When I
change the oil and add the recommended 4.8 quarts the level is at the
top mark.That means the lower mark equals 79% of capacity. That oil has
to do the same amount of cooling and lubricating which means reduced
life. It also states that &quot;oil consumption is normal&quot; and &quot;immediately
add oil if below min&quot; so I conclude that running at a min level is
rather risky business.VW has been making the flat four for a long time.
I would think they know the minimum safe level. I believe VW has to fill
out a US environmental impact statement concerning oil usage by the
number of vehicles sold times the number of times a year that vehicles
will change their oil. This is why they  only recommend twice a year. To
normal driving this would equate  to 6000 miles! How often do you change
yours? What I am trying to say is that if they thought it was safe to
run at 3.8 quarts they would.
Keep cool

rise, but 
&gt;watch the falling pressure as the oil gets aerated.  You still need to
find

the hose
