&gt; I believe my 83 westy has got the vanagon overheating syndrome which was said
&gt; to be common among early watercooled vanagons. An indication of this syndrome
&gt; is that coolant in the cooling system got expelled out back to the reserve 
&gt; tank. The cooling system is slowly filled with air and eventually the
&gt; coolant sensor in the pressure tank detects low coolant. The temp gauge will
&gt; run to the extreme right and the LED will blink, crying bloody muder.

You have the problem all right... and if you continue to allow the temp 
to get that high, you'll have many more problems.

&gt; 
&gt; It was said that the problem was because of the poor quality of the head 
&gt; gaskets used on early watrecooled vanagons. My 83 westy has this problem
&gt; and also suffers from relatively low power compare to my healthy 84 vanagon.
&gt; My westy is too young, 60k miles, to suffer from this syndrome.

A wasserboxer is never too young for this problem,  It's an engineering 
mistake coupled with less than adaquate testing.

 &gt; 
&gt; I am considering to fix this problem by replacing the head gaskets. I also
&gt; got an impression that these gaskets are very expensive, something like
&gt; around $1500. I looked at my Bentley book and I saw only sealing rings 
&gt; between heads and cylinders. There is another seal surrounging each heads to
&gt; seal off coolant from leaking to outside of engine. I can't see why these
&gt; sealing stuff could cost me up to $1500. 

I think those rings are part of a gasket (someone correct me if I'm wrong)

&gt; 
&gt; I am also considering to tighten all head bolts to see if it can cure it.
&gt; Is this a good idea?

NO!!! go with the first plan, tightening the head bolts after the leak 
has already found a path won't stop the leak.  Tightening the head bolts 
will very likely allow your heads to warp badly (especially with the 
higher temps associated with the coolant prob.)
Don't do it!

&gt; 
&gt; Did anyone have any experience fixing this syndrome? Any info is very much 
&gt; appreciated.

When you do it or have it done, it is a good idea (IMHO) to have the face of
your heads machined as the leaking appearantly can cause some distortion.
I had my heads machined when I replaced my head gaskets (Yes, I am 
speaking from experience) and haven't had the problem reoccur(touch some 
wood for me)
Whereas, another 85 vanagon driver with whom I discussed this problem, 
told me that he had his machined only the SECOND time he had the prob.
I think the word second means somthing if you get my drift.

Well David,  I hope that I've been helpful.

&gt; 

To everyone else, I apologise for not keeping this to private mail, I 
know you've seen it all before,  But it is a common problem and David may 
not have been the only one interested.
