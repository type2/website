        Charles,
        Electrical draw = heat. (other wise known as Watts, or power)
        It is not possible to get good heat out of a electrical 
        system in an auto. The amount of electrcal power drain
        would over tax the autos capability. Even a rear window
        defogger is a major drain, and all it
        does is raise the temp. above the dew point.
