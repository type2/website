How to Hotrod Volkswagen Air-Cooled Engines.  By Bill Fisher.  
      170 pages, 1988. ISBN number 0-912656-03-4.  Paperback, $14.95.

The above information comes from the 1994-95 edition of Book in Print.

You can probably order these books from your local bookstore or from 
Classic Motorbooks (1-800-458-0454).
