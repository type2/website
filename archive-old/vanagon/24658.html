And don't hesitate to write a synopsis of your experience, making
sure all of your facts are correct, and post it to the rec.autos.vw
and rec.autos.makers.vw.aircooled newsgroups.  The PartsPlace has
been appearing there lately, offering advice and free catalogs.
I got a free catalog and when I saw that many of the prices are
more than the equivalent Gene Berg prices (for stock parts and
common tools (example, the thing you put on your 36mm rear
axle nut to bang it off, Parts Place $12 or 13, Berg: 8 something)
I decided that the potential ordering hassles wouldn't be worth
it.
