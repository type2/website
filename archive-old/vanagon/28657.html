Subject: 1980 Vanagon Engine Work

I've read about people dropping the engine on buses up to 79.  I'm looking at a engine overhaul and exhaust work on a 1980 Vanagon Camper I bought.  Three 
questions:

1.  Can a novice drop this engine and do the work? (I had two years of auto mechanics back in 76 through 78 and did work on my Fiat, Opel and Mercedes during 
ny younger days but certainly not a engine rebuild)

2.  If I can, does anybody have a line on parts with a good price?

3.  Is the procedure documented in one of the popular manuals?

I just left my friendly neighborhood VW specialist and he'll do the job for $5,000 plus -  Ouch :-( 

Thanks all....
