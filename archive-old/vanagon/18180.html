Thanks for the responses, I also felt a little uneasy about the
recycled antifreeze, so I'll tell the mechanic to use new 
Autotbahn coolant. My '86 Westy has 128K miles on it, so I think 
having the radiator checked for blockage would be a good thing to do.
Does the radiator have to be pulled for a blockage test to be done?

I've replaced the pop top seal with one from Whitney. The old one came
off way too easily. All of the steel clips were rusted and dirt was
the only thing holding the seal to the fiberglass. Installing the new
seal wasn't too hard. Cleaned all surfaces with soap and water, then
went along the front edge with alcohol to remove any residue. I cleaned
the front edge seal with the alcohol before I glued the seal to the
fiberglass with GE silicon sealant. 

Installation of the luggage rack seal was a little more difficult.
The new seal pushed the rack away from the mounting brackets. I had
to pull down on the rack while a friend installed the screws.

Anybody going to Mountain Bike Weekend          0
