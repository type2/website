Subject: New Catagory for Joel


In response to my little parody of &quot;Make up Your Mind&quot; Steve
&quot;Older than Dirt&quot; Johnson lamented that certain people (
I believe he was speaking for himself 8-)  ) were showing
their age....well in Joel's little inventory I think the
following catagory could be added:

I can remember when there were only the following Typ2s on the
road:

a: None at all
b. Split Windshields
c. Split Windshields and Bread Loaves
d. Split Windshields, Bread Loaves, and Bricks
e. Split Windshields, Bread Loaves, Bricks, and those WAY COOL
   EuroVans
f. Don't remember anything.....too many experiments back in the
   60s with mind altering drugs 



I'll even throw in my first memory of a Type 2....a neighbor's
Orangish-Red/Black 21 window bus with sunroof....57 or so?
