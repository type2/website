Subject:      Who started this Mess??

i'm sorry, folks, but this crap keeps running around in my brain. remember,
now ... it's to the tune of Oh My Darling Clementine:


Ralf and Jim work on their buses,
Wearing panties and a braaaaar,
Neither one of them has much money,
so their clothes are be-low par.

Mike went camping in the mountains
Where the 4 by 4's do roam.
Viscious critters ate his brake lines,
Had to drag a log back home.

&lt;ok. ok. so it's a real stretch for 'poetic license'.&gt; :)
