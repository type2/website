Subject: Need Westy sliding door screen

I am planning to make/buy a bug screen for my 85 Westy sliding door. 

Do any of you fellow Vanagon listers have experiance making/buying one of
these? The bug screen would be used while the sliding door is open saving
wear and tear opening/closing the door while camping. Any information would
be helpful.

Thanks in advance all
