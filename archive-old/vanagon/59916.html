I prefer this with some fava beans and a nice chianti.

Seriously though, are you talking about sealed beam or halogens 
w/replacable bulbs?  Or is it possible you're looking at the clear 
plastic covers over the headlight bulbs?  My van has these covers and 
they have gotten moisture in them after heavy rains.  If you have water 
in a sealed beam it sounds like it could be broken, if replaceable bulbs, 
maybe (I would use a very low het).  If its the covers they come out 
with the headlight (remove ring) and could be wiped clean.
