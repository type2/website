Subject: Towing a bus: summary

Volks,
	A while ago I asked you all for opinions on towing a bus 500 miles.

When I mentioned towing it with my bus, a few of you told me to go for
it, and the rest told me I was nuts.  Well, it turns out I can't find
a hitch that will handle 3,000 lbs that I can put on my bus, so that
idea is out anyway.

Then, there was the possibility of towing it with my Mustang.  Turns out
the biggest hitch I can fit on the Mustang is 2,000 lbs, so that is out
too.

Finally, I found a friend with an F-150 truck that was willing to let me
borrow it, so I called around about a tow dolly or trailer.  Turns out 
that this truck, being 4 wheel drive, has a hitch that is too high off
the ground to hitch up to anything - seems there is a max height of 16&quot;
and his hitch sits well over 2 feet in the air.  Scratch that idea too.

Finally, some suggested renting a truck to tow the trailer with.  Okay,
the cheapest I could find charged $49 + 17 cents a mile.  That's over
$200, not counting the trailer and gas.  Uh uh.

So, at this point, life gets rough, if I want to get my recently
purchased '72 Westy back to San Diego in one piece.  My comedian friend
at work suggested I federal express it.  While I know it to be true
that Federal Express will ship *anything* *anywhere*, I also know that
I would have to mortgage my mother to pay for it.

I guess there is no option but to drive the bus back, one way or
another.  Looks like the easiest way to do this is to yank my engine
and drive it up there.  Tomorrow morning bright and early I will be
yanking my engine out and setting it in the back of the Mustang, along
with the floor jack, tools, and spare parts.  Then, it's off to Jeff's
house for fun fun fun!

Wish me luck,

-David
