Subject:      Volkswagen Van Day - 9/28

Hi all. I got notice of this event when I was at the &quot;Vacationland&quot;(Maine)
Show&quot;. The Museum of Transportation in Brookline, MA is sponsoring
Volkswagen Van Day, 9/28, from 9:00 - 2:00 PM. The Museum is a great place
and they sponsored this event for a number of years. Admission is $
5(covers the driver and one guest) Other guests are $5, $3 per student(I
have that old ID somewhere!!) and $3 for seniors(62+) and kids (6 - 16).
How to get there? Check out the web page at www.MOT.Org or call 617 - 522 -
6547. Don't ask me, I once spent half a semester trying to find it, but
then it was the early 70's!! See you there!.
        Mike
