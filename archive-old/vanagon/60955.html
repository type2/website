Ron, you wrote:

&lt;&lt;  Here's the problem.... Runs fine, and cold on AC, DC, but when
I switch to propane,  only after more than 10,000 pumps, the pilot
finally lights, and shows the green light on my display.  However,  it's
not cooling... when I put my ear near the flue, I don't hear the
customary rumbling of the burner working. &gt;&gt;

   I've forgotten more than once to make sure that the thermostat
is turned all the way _up_...D'ohhh!  As far as hearing the burner
rumbling, mine rumbles, but others I've listened to are completely
silent.
