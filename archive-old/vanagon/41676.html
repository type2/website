Subject: brake adjuster clip

     Hey all,  as long as we're talking drum brakes:  I'm doing the fronts 
     on my '66 and on each backing plate (left and right) I'm missing one 
     of the clips rivetted to the plate to stop the adjuster from turning 
     back.  Anyone have real world experience with this same problem.  Does 
     it matter?  If so, anyone have a catalog with backing plates for drum 
     brakes?
