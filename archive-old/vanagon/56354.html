&gt;I own a 1984 Westfalia. It has the fiberglass pop-up top. I would like
&gt;to carry a canoe on the roof. Problem: I can't find any clamp-on roof
&gt;racks for this model. Anybody know where this item is available? Any
&gt;other ideas about how to carry a canoe on the roof?

Yakima makes a hi - rise toploader rack w/ &quot;fake raingutters&quot; that bolt to
fiberglass.
