George and Ellen,

I just bought 8 of them from Trans-Ocean VW in Pasadena because our
local &quot;Nissan, Kia, Suzuki, and oh yeah, we sell VW's&quot; dealer told a
friend of mine the same thing about the guides.  Trans-Ocean VW only had
5 in stock and had to order 3 more.  Part number is: 281 847 723B.  I
bought these 4/16/97. Trans Ocean VW does not do mail order or at least
they do not want to mail parts to me when they come in. But it is a nice
90 minute drive through the mountains to Pasadena from our house.  But
you can try them at 213-684-0444.  They have always been very helpful
and knowledgeable when I've gone to get/order parts from them.  The
parts guy told me that these guides superceed the guides prior to 85(?)
which were of slightly different design (Chris did you get them to fit
your 84?).

Hope this helps,

Garth
