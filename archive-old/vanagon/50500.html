&gt; I found a temporary fix.  Simply smack the dash right above the gauges 2

&gt; would like to know of a definite fix also.  But the smacking really
worked
&gt; for me.

I'll second the smack method -- although I have to really whack it hard
with the side of my fist.  Expect some strange looks if you do it while
stopped in traffic...

I recall someone talking about some sort of soldering that would fix this
if you are willing to pull the dash/gauge panels and have some soldering
skills. But I don't remember where it came from or what the specifics are. 
Maybe someone else will chime in...
