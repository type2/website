Subject: Installing 2nd Heater

Has anyone installed a second heater in diesel vanagon? I would like to
install one by tapping into the existing heater hoses. I recently took a
trip and had some cold weather, about 10 degrees. Moving down the highway
at 60 MPH the air going through the heat exchanger moves so fast it just
doesn't have enough time to warm up. Cutting down on the volume of air with
the third lever didn't help much either. I felt the heater hoses and they
were both hot, which tells me I still have plenty of BUTs available to me I
just gotta get them into the passenger compartment.
