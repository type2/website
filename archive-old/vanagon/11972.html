Subject: Excessive Oil Usage
Date: Wed, 22 Feb 95 14:37:04 PST

Dear VW-ers;

On my 80 Vanagon air-cooled, I have about 1 Qt of oil usage every 200 miles
or so. There is almost no leakage, so I guess the oil must be getting burnt.

Is there a good way of determining which parts are broken?
The engine is developing good compression though.

Any info would be greatly appreciated.

Regards,
Vahid
