Subject: Re: 84 exhaust prices

BU&gt;being offered in regular (unleaded?), but still at a ridiculous price for th
BU&gt;poor quality outa Denmark (not to mention the crazy Mark/Dollar Exchange Rat
BU&gt;as well).  At Bus Boys, we have recently started to offer a real sweet USA

Having recently put on the Dansk pipes may I be the first to say
they are total CRAP.  Worse than they were a few years ago BTW.
I mean they are bad, flanges not welded on parallel, stessing the pipes.
To fit the front pipe I had to overdrill the mounting holes, front and
rear pipes flanges into the connector pipe out of line by like 3/16&quot;.
I mean I was so pissed I wanted to send her back but unfortunately
with my mods and it already being on, I don't figure Parts Place
from which it came would be receptive, plus as I later found I paid
too much for even the Dansk from them.  All in all with another choice
for the 1.9l I would have taken it, of course found out a bit too late.
I'd try Bus Boys system in a second given a second opportuninty
and hell I might be soon enough anyway the way the rust belt is.
Course if I had a CATALOG from Bus Boys maybe I'd realize they were
selling this thing now and would have already tried it.
