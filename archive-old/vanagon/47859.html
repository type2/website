So Shepard, Scott says:
&gt; Hello all,
&gt; Has any one ever run into any kind of table made to fit between the
&gt; front seats of a Vanagon.  In my travels to and from work (about 45
&gt; min.) 

My '91 GL came with two tables.  One back over the cabinets that swings
out in front of the bench seat.  The other is behind the drivers seat
and swings around to between the two front seats.  All of the vanagon
camper models have this option I believe.  I'm not sure about the
multivan.  I'm sure you could scavenge one from a wrecking yard.
