Subject: headlight covers; side door screen; awning

Today I saw the coolest factory screen for the entire opening of the sliding
door on an '84 Westy Wolfsburg.  Where are these or something comparable
available for my '91 Syncro?  Also looking for one of those awnings that
hang in a rigid tube fromt he rain gutter, and have a window-shade style
pullout action.

And more important than anything, I'm seeking Lexan headlight covers to
hopefully avoid costly replacement of those snazzy '91 headlights.

Sources and prices for these items used or new would be appreciated.
