Subject:      BBTA PHOTOS! (first raw batch)

Greetings-

I've scanned a couple of my photos from BBTA and posted them; I don't
have my personal system set up yet, so these are untouched/uncropped
photos for the most part, and I haven't yet had a chance to make
index/thumbnail photos for these yet. I'll probably be
able to do some more next Monday or Tuesday. If you see your
bus in one of the photos and want your name/bus name listed in the
caption, let me know!
The address is:

http://vw.svaha_dot_com

(note the vw instead of www)
Or (if you have problems with that one)

http://www.svaha_dot_com/~vw

I had a great time, and now know what I need to bring next time.
Half the fun of the caravan was listening in on the CB, and to
those who didn't have a CB, I think you missed out :(

I cara-bussed back with Ted Finesman down the back roads of
route 50 from St. Louis to Cincinnati. After hearing the incredible
stories of how people found busses, crew cabs, and westies, I
kept my eyes open along the way; Mostly what I saw were basic
7 passenger transporters. The big shock was in a town called
Olney, Illinois (i beleive). There is a foreign auto repair
on the south side of 50- the owner must have collected every
bug and most of the busses in a 50 mile+ radius! He had
four or five rows of bugs going back a acre or so, and a dozen
or so busses that I saw! I have his number in my vanagon, I'll post
next time I bring it in. If I remember correctly, it was called
Crazy 8's or something like that. Unfortunately, being Labor
Day, he was closed.

And to top off the bus karma, I got back, and after winning the
stupid trick of the month award (reversing the connections on a
new fuel pump, and then not being able to figure out
why the pump runs, but no fuel is entering the engine), I fixed
the wiring and the '77 that hasn't run in an embarrasing amount of
time started right up! Yee haw!

So, look for more photos next week... and Bill, if you are
out there, send me your address and I'll send you what photos
I have and you can take your pick for your article..
