&gt;I've read a few posts that say Barsleak works.  Some have posted that
&gt;it might clog the radiator works, but one of the other posters Steve T.???
&gt;said he's gotten mucho miles after with no trouble.

I have an extremely slight leak (about a half a cup every week) that neither
I, nor two dealers, nor an independant mechanic, can find (even after pulling
the engine for a new clutch, the source of the leak is still a mystery).
 Origianlly, the leak was about twice as bad, ~1 cup per week, but I decided
to try the Barrs stuff, and it slowed the leak way down.  I've been tempted
to add another treatment, but have decided not to, based on the other
listmembers recommendations.  BTW, all of the aforementioned experts have
ensured me that it's NOT the heads leaking (the gaskets have already been
replaced, about 22K miles ago.._dot_caps have been pressure-tested, hoses are OK,
no leaks around the coolant level sensor, etc, etc, blah, blah...
