Subject:      brake hoses

&gt;I can't agree that they are a toy.

neither can i ... i don't think i said that. what i THOUGHT i said was that
unless you have a car that has performance to justify needing that extra
little bit of braking, it's not worth the money. especially on the vanagons
and buses we were talking about.  now, i'd love to put them on mine, but i
can't quite get around to spending the money of that NEED just yet. since i
haven't noticed that the vanagon is deficient in braking. (or i don't drive
it that hard).

i didn't think the hoses on the buses were that 'long' ... only the last
6-8 inches on each wheel are made of rubber. all the rest are standard metal
brake lines.

but do they work better? sure. so would disk brakes on the rear wheels! and
911 brakes on the front wheels (like someone in one of the magazines did)!
and i would love to have all of that plus a 2.8 liter 911 6-cylinder engine
in the back. :)  sigh. one of these days ...  but if you can afford the
time and money to put the stainless braided brake hoses on your bus, by all
means, DO IT.

but the point i was trying to make (unsuccessfully, i guess) was that for
a bread truck, it isn't worth it. IMHO. well, at least it isn't worth it
when i don't have the money to do it. :)  now, those big lights on the front
bumper? i NEEED my lights!!!
