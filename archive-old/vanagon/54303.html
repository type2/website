 Is it possible the airfow box electrical contact has worn out at this low
 of mileage-would that account for the clearing-up at increased acceleraton?
 
 I don't think the temp II sender has ever been replace, will buy and carry
 as a spare.
 
 I guess it could have been a bit of H20 in the fuel, but not
 likely.(Filters new- should catch)
 
 
 Has anyone experienced this problem in your 84-85?

I had a similar problem that turned out to be the throttle switch.  Switch
worked, but was so loose that contact closure/opening occurred at various
times.  This is a critical spec for good operation.  switch should open when
throttle stop pin is between .002 to .004 inches from stop.  If too large,
engine surges.  If too small, engine cuts out at acceleration.
