Subject:      Propane strangeness + Advice

He there propane  users,

1. The strangness,  I turned on the propane and noticed a shhhhh sound from
the plastic cover to the left of the valve.  I heard a similar sound once
when the breather valve to the right of the turn on valve was loose.  I took
off the plastice shield and looked at the, regulater? I guess it is.  and
using the sound found a tiny slit on the under side of the piece. It is very
small, like the corner of a razer blade would make on a piece of paper.  I
could hardly feel it.  The rest of the part was smooth and the whole thing
looked clean.  The PO NEVER used the propane except the stove onece or
twice.  What could have happened?

2.  Now what do I do?
