I have a set!  They are nice quality, heavy weight rubber with a nice
edge to contain the water.  My only beef is this; the mats are not
left/right they are booth exactly alike.  Not a big deal as the only
real difference is a cut out for the gas pedal.  This causes them to
slide somewhat and the carpet is exposed at the cut out.

Hope this helps!

&gt; Charles,
&gt;The number for Parts Place is (810) 373-2300 and fax (810)373-5950. I 
&gt;lost my catalog, so I don't have the part number. I don't have them so I 
&gt;can't give you any info re quality, although they look good :) Maybe 
&gt;someone else on the list has them?

&gt;&gt; Thanks for your help with the Vanagon rubber floor mats.  I'd be interested
&gt;&gt;in
&gt;&gt; looking into the Parts Place mats.  If you have the phone number, please
&gt;&gt;E-Mail
&gt;&gt; it back to me.  I am wondering how heavy-dury the plastic ones are.  Will
&gt;&gt;they
&gt;&gt; hold mud and snow?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Thanks,
&gt;&gt;
