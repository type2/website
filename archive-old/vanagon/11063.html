The fluid drip is quite likely from your clutch master cylinder. Maybe you
will be lucky and it's only a bad connection from the resevoir to the
cylinder, or a loosened fitting on the high pressure side. But iys more
likely that the cylinder itself is shot, I advise buying a new one
outright, ($76 Canadian last time I checked).
But maybe you have an automatic transmission...

As an aside, I hate dark tinted windows for one reason: backing-up at night.
You can't see a blessed thing.


But they do look cool from the outside.
