Subject: another tire ?
Date: Fri, 14 Oct 1994 05:46:58 -0400 (EDT)

While shoping for tires yesterday I was offered some ARMSTRONG NORSEMAN
LT195/75-14 RBL for $108.90 canadian each.  Has anyone used these?   
There is no &quot;reinforced&quot; sidewall designation, however the salesman told
me that all LT tires are &quot;reinforced&quot; sidewall tires.  Is this true or am
I being given the sales pitch ?  They look like nice tires and are
supposed to be &quot;all season radials&quot; , tread pattern not too aggresive
looking and they are supposed to run quiet. Any and all comment welcome.

Cheers,

Frank
