Subject: Re: Profiting on VWs, etc \ caution: long (and final) rant

I personally enjoy reading EVERYTHING from EVERYONE on ANY SUBJECT on
V_at_L.
I've learned VERY MUCH from the contributors.
I've bought things from the list (Syncro air filters for example).
I've used knowledge gained here to save time, money and anxiety.
I've laughed at the wit.

THERE IS A PLACE FOR ALL.

Go ahead, tell me I'm alone.
