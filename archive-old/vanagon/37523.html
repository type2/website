Subject: vanagon dash bulbs?

No, no.  not those things you stick in your blummenvasen.  Light 
bulbs.  Anyone found a non-dealer, non-junkyard replacement for the instrument lights in 
the vanagons?

i had bought a pack of small bulbs that were the same dimension as 
the ones in the black plastic holders.  spent about 45 minutes 
fiddling with getting the old bulb out, soldering in a new one, and 
reforming all the melted plastic from the 'repair'.  ecch.  need an 
easier way.
