Subject: 	Re: 87 Vanagon: installing VDO oil pressure and temperature 

     
     Gene Berg instructions say to NEVER use Teflon tape on the senders. 
     Don't recall the reason, whether it will contaminate the oil or just 
     because with tape it would be easy to overtighten and possibly split 
     the hole.
