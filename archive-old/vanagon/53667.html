The waterboxer Kombi I have also has this ductwork -- very similar to some
of the air-cooled vans.  The ductwork is pretty ugly raised-square pattern
stuff like a rubber floormat, but is plastic and despite the bumps on it is
pretty slippery.  I'd suspect that the Panels might have this as well, 
although only Kombi's and Doublecabs expected people in the back.

&gt; &gt;BTW I am really pleased with this heater. The front heater does not seem to
&gt; &gt;duct towards the back as it did in the aircooled (vents on the floor
&gt; &gt;between the 2 front seats). Is this for all watercooleds or only the ones
&gt; &gt;with a rear heater?

&gt; In the crewcabs there is a ductwork on top of the floor between the foot
&gt; heater in the front and the outlet on top of that place where are the floor
&gt; vents of the aircooled.
&gt; 
&gt; I have one set of an '87 crewcab for sale, the ductwork and an adapter box 
&gt; to
&gt; connect it to the front heater.
