&gt;Hmmm....off topic, but what timing! I found the following URL:

&gt;http://wwwlkiss_dot_com/fr/showpage

&gt;There are some very beautiful Russian women with ads shown.

&gt;Am I going to get booted for a week for sending this?


Only if we find that Unkle Joel starts reading the &quot;showpage&quot; and
begins &quot;crank polishing&quot; instead of putting out his usual friday
lists and poems and songs....etc...etc...

Hopefully Joel keeps up with the Alabama-supported intellectual
masturbation!  8-)

PS...do I get the feeling that Unkle Joel is going to shut down
