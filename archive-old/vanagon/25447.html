Subject: Bodywork/Welding Questions

Hi All,
	I was hoping someone might help me with some questions.  Since I 
recently purchased a '66 Westy with some rust areas (rockers mostly) I 
need to learn to do some bodywork.  I'm thinking of buying a MIG welder 
and doing it myself but I don't know how powerful I need it to be.  Does 
anyone know what I should get?  And what gauge is body sheetmetal 
anyway?  What gauge are replacement panels?  and where is the best source 
for these?  What about the inside rockers? (I think these are thicker).  
Well, Thanks in advance.

-Erik
