Subject: Re: Re: Waving Vanagon drivers (again)


Well, here's the scene in BC as experienced by a loaf driver:

- Splitties ALWAYS wave back, even in city traffic.  ('course, I go 
absolutely beserk waving like an idiot when I see one, so I'd be pretty 
hard to miss...)
- Loafs wave back about 1/3 of the time in heavy city traffic, almost all 
the time on 2-lane highways.  Westies wave more.  Westies with canoes, 
mountain bikes, kayaks, or electric winches on the roof ALWAYS wave back.
- Lowered busses (when I rarely see them, and if I can't shoot them 
first) never wave.
- Air-cooled bricks sometimes wave, but rarely.  Water-pumper bricks wave 
back even less frequently.  I hate to admit it, but I've almost given up 
on water pumpers, and usually don't initiate a wave, unless it's a westy.
- Eurovans: are you kidding?  I don't think folks around here even know 
what it is to drive a VW bus/van/whatever you'd call the thing.  I've 
NEVER gotten a wave, or even an eye-to-eye look, from ANY Eurovan around 
here on a paved road.  Yuppie mobile.  I tried waving all spring and 
summer, but now I wave rarely at E-vans--I guess I don't take rejection 
well.  ;)
- The only Eurovan wave I got was on a logging road about 20 miles from 
the nearest pavement, and I waved as I slowed down to watch them dragging 
their chassis over one rock, then another, then ding their front spoiler 
for the hundredth time.  The nervous fellow driving it waved back weakly, 
but on roads like that, EVERYBODY waves.

(uh oh... do I smell lighter fluid?)
