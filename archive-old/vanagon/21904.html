Hello all:

The PO of my '83 Vanagon ran the engine dry (sans oil) so the bottom end
has spun main bearings and is in need of retooling.

Are there any shops (preferably in the Midwest/IN region) that do this kind
of work?  If so, how much will it cost?  If not, what other options do I
have (GEX, etc.)?

Thanks,
Paul 	'83 Vanagon (Emma)
