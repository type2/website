Don,
 
Is one of the inner CV joints hanging up on the flywheel?  On a Rabbit, the
flywheel has three cutouts on it and you have to turn the crankshaft so one
of the cutouts clears the CV joint before removing the transmission.  I
suppose the EV could be the same way.  This is just a guess, as I have
never worked on a EV.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; A list member has been having problems in a clutch job on a EV.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The mechanic says that the trans is &quot;stuck&quot; on the engine. I found out
&gt; that
&gt; &gt; on the EV there is a pin or bolt that is used to hold the throw-out
lever
&gt; &gt; and release bearing away from the pressure plate to allow for easier
&gt; removal
&gt; &gt; of the transmission. They have done this but still no joy. The mechanic
&gt; says
&gt; &gt; that there seems to be something else that is holding the trans on the
&gt; &gt; engine. It moves out about an inch and then will not go any further.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The VW books do not have any other tricks. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; My thought is that maybe the fingers on the pressure plate got really
&gt; badly
&gt; &gt; worn out and then the release bearing got pushed into the fingers and
now
&gt; &gt; will not come out. Has any one ever seen this happen?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Please post any help.
