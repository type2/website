&gt; I have noticed this when the throttle is hammered on for high-rpm usage.
&gt; May also have to do with worn rings, and a lot of  crankcase blow-by?
&gt; I suspect that oil comes out the breather tube beside the  oil filler cap,
&gt; and maybe  goes into the inlet of the air cleaner, where some comes out
&gt; the inlet?

Yes, I agree that high throttle is key. Some good guesses on the other stuff, 
but here's my experience:

1. I had the problem with new heads.

2. I had brand new Mahle pistons and rings.

3. I replaced the breather hoses and sealed the all breather connections. I 
highly suspected this and played around with various setups. 

4. Air filters on my dual carbs get filthy, but this would be expected with the 
oil getting blown around like it is.

Somehow it seems like it must be getting in the fan shroud to get atomized and 
blown around like it does, but I can't figure out how.
