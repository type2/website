Subject: volksfest friday plans


I've been e-mailing back and forth with one of our list members
who plans to attend the Volksfest next weekend (July 21-23).  He
is Ken (kenb_at_SIRIUS.COM), and seems to be quite familiar with
the coastal area to the west of Lakeport's latitude, having 
spent a good deal of time up and down the pacific between
the bay area and on up to Oregon.  Since no one else has responded,
I suggest we adopt his recommendation to camp at Qualala, which
I still have yet to look up on the map, but think it is not
too terribly far afield from Guernville.  This being perhaps
further than we originally planned from the Bay Area may help
our friends coming from the north (Jim at busboys, and Jeff Rosen).

According to Ken, the area is supposed to have plenty of amenities,
and hopefully the weather will be nice and cool over near 
the ocean (in contrast to what we may see the following days
in Lakeport).  Anyway, I'll look this up on the map and try
to decipher some directions.  

Here's who I have planning to attend:

Jeff Rosen                      jeffro_at_u.washington_dot_edu
Bradley Magnesium               bradleym_at_netcom_dot_com
Martha Rubin                    nrubin_at_s1.csuhayward_dot_edu
Jim Thompson                    busboys_at_aol_dot_com
Albrecht Jander                 jander_at_hplgauss.hpl.hp_dot_com
Ken Bowen                       kenb_at_SIRIUS.COM

------

The more the merrier, so if you can attend please let me know!
