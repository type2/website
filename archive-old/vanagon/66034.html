Subject:      Sticking brakes

I just replaced pads and rotors on my '88 Vanagon. (Girling brakes) I thought
that I had done everything according to the manual, and even made sure to add
caliper grease to all the sliding areas on the calipers.

However the brakes are always dragging, never fully releasing. If I take a
drive of 10 miles or so, I can get out and smell the hot brake pads, and the
alloy wheel is hot to the touch.

Any suggestions? I've never had brakes that worked too well before...
