&gt;Just got into work.  We have some contractors in doing renovation work on one
&gt;of the buildings.  And what do I see in the contractors carpark this morning
&gt;- a 56 single cab.  Had a good walk around/peek under it  and it's

I went with a buddy of mine to look at a bus a while back, and the guy that
was selling the bus had as his work-mobile a '62 sunroof deluxe!  He was 
carrying all his sheetrock stuff around in it!  It had front and rear
safaris, lowererd, with polished Porsche alloys.  Unfortunately he A) 
didn;t wanna sell it, and B) he was beating the thing up beyonf belief -
tons of dings and scratches from his tools and stuff..
