Subject: Got the Shaft..No more Bad Vibes

I'm a happy camper again. Just installed my new driveshaft (from Parr VW in
WA for 100 bucks less than local dealer), took the syncro for a test drive
and the vibrations are gone! Smooth from 0 to 65--like it used to be a long
time ago.

When I got home, I drove into the woods through 6-8&quot; of snow just to make
sure the front drive was working right. Is it ever nice to get the all-wheel
drive going again! Now I need to free up the rear diff lock and get the gas
gauge working and it'll be like new at 126K. Well, almost like new.
