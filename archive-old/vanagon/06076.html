&gt;   Yup!    But maybe someplace on the coast (Pismo Beach, Morro Bay???)
&gt;   would be warmer, considering the time of year. Also, Seqouia NP is bit
&gt;   disrupted right now because they are moving the Giant Forest Lodge.

The place I mentioned to Marta is not actually in Sequoia NP, but in the
Sequoia Nat'l Forest (sorry for the confusion!).  I will have to get out
the map, but it is somewhere East of Fresno.  There is a large Indian
reservation there, and a highway running around it on the West side that
has several small campgrounds.  It seems to be largely overlooked by the
hoards of campers that run to the hills for the weekend, which is why I
like it.  There is a nice hike up to a little &quot;house&quot; that sits on top
of a huge rock jutting out near the top of a mountain.  The rangers use
it for a fire lookout (seasonal, of course).  The house is over 50 years
old, and is quite a sight.  One of the campgrounds nearby, Peppermint, is
fairly large and has a year-round creek running through it.  Also lots of
room to &quot;free camp&quot;.  You need a permit to build fires anywhere in the 
area, which you can get from the rangers.  
	I'm not too sure about camping in the mountains in the winter,
but Martha wants Trees and Snow, and what Martha wants, Martha gets!!!
Hey, she would probably have to wear those flannel shirts, too...  :)
What do you all think?
