Subject:        Re: Used alternator for '84 wanted

&gt;If anyone has a used alternator for an '84 Vanagon w/o air please let me
&gt;know.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Bryan

     Bryan, before you replace the alternator, make sure that you don't
simply need to replace the brushes/voltage regulator.  It is a black
plastic rectangle (or circle on my a/c 84) on the back of the alternator
held by two screws.  Remove the screws, and pull the unit out.  There
should be two pieces of grey metal with concave rounded ends.  If they
are plenty long (10-15mm) something else is wrong.  If they are worn down
to the nub, replace the at your FLAPS and be on you merry way.
