Subject: Re: torque, rear brakes

conincedentally, during this threads life, i suddenly realized that the newly
revived 67 camper i'm driving this month (ok, still undergoing reviving)
doesn't have the pins in the rear wheel nuts.   so, to save my bad back  i
prefer not to use the poundimiform and big hammer.  yes, folks, im still
aching here from that smashup six months ago. So, day before  yesterday  i
pull out the big socket, 3/4 to 1/2 converter, 1/2 drive breaker bar, and
pipe.   attach same to axle nut, push down (actually step on it) and promptly
brak the d*mn breaker bar.  duh.  okay, it's craftsman and replacable, but
the converter aint, and i still have the pins to put in.

I get out the poundimiform  (impact wrench) and the hammer.  no go.  need a
bigger hammer.  the 4lb one is one it's way east somewhere, so i get the 8 lb
maul for wood splitting, mash the poundimiform, and knock the nuts into
place.  pins are  in.   this is not good for the back.  why didn't i wait?
 i'm no good at the old damsel in distress thing.  (won't you please help me
with my axle nuts.  I know that you are sooo strong.  bat lashes).   so i
take a hike down to the creek in the ravine and back, and build a good fire
and get some heat on my back.  and guess what!  it's not as bad as i thought
it would be!  :) 

then yesterday i drive over the my friend jim the pro wood worker who is
splicing the birch veneer together so i will have a pretty piece for the long
panel on the passenger side of the camper with the grain running vertically.
 this is the guy with the gas in the oil.   i pulled off the fuel pump and
there *was* gas  leaking out of it into the case.  new pump, too.   but the
thing was, that on the way there i hear this funny noise from the back of the
camper. hmm  i dont like that.  should i wait till i get there?  it's only a
couple miles.  nah.  i pull over and the noise slows down. trans?  i hope
not.  the noise stops when i stop.  not in the engine, then.  i shut it off,
and walk around the bus.  lug nuts on left rear are almost off.  glad i
stopped.  :).  of course, my  tire tool is a 3/4 impact drive on that 1/2
drive broken breaker bar.    so i wave someone down (rural road) to get a
loan of a lug whench.  (damsel in distress? not dressed for the part) got
help from a guy with greasy jeans and barking dog in an old truck.  as he got
out the tools, he said.  &quot;looks like your bus is in good shape for one that
old.  i had three of these, one had the doors on both sides, real rare&quot;  i
wouldn't have guessed from looking at him that he would have been coaght dead
in a vw.  Goes to show you never can tell.   

I went to sears today and got replacement tools (i had saved up a couple
other broken ones).  the flex end of the breaker bar fell out of the
converter when I dropped it in the parking lot.  :)

Emma kitty is purring now, and wants attention, so I gotta go.   bye now, and
go check your lug nuts
