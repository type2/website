&gt;Hmmm. I remember seeing some TV program a few years ago about some

&gt;Surely all you need is a scaled up version, and you could *drive* your

I was at Lake Powell a few years ago and saw a barge contraption that a 
 small Winnebago rode on, the rear wheels powered a paddle and the 
 front had a ramp like a landing craft. This thing had about a foot of 
 freeboard, so I assume it is at the bottom of the lake, after one of 
 the infamous storms they have in the canyon.
