                     Big Engine Reliability

Increasing the displacement of the Volkswagen engine is easily
done through the use of larger diameter cylinders and a crank
having a longer stroke.  The larger engines produce more
horsepower.  They also produce more waste heat.  Unfortunately,
larger engines do not add additional cooling fins nor increase
the flow of cooling air.  Unless the increased heat load is dealt
with, the service life of the larger engine is drastically
reduced.

It's possible to produce large displacement VW engines that
reliably deliver 80 to 100 hp for 100,000 miles or more, but only
when careful attention is focused on the cooling system and the
realities imposed by laws of physics.  Such attention usually
runs counter to the flow of conventional wisdom fueled by grossly
misleading magazine articles and legions of self-appointed
experts.

A good example has to do with external oil coolers.  Given the
size and placement of the early-stock oil cooler, an immediate
improvement in service life is realized by removing the stock oil
cooler and replacing it with a larger cooler of suitable design
mounted over the air inlet to the blower housing.  This has the
effect of pre-heating the cooling air but it also serves to
distribute the heat to all four cylinders, whereas the stock
cooler placement concentrated its load on the #3 cylinder.  This
problem plagued all VW owners until introduction of the dog-house
type cooler, which is of course an external oil cooler but one
provided with a blast of cooling air independent of engine
cooling, that is, a larger fan, separate inlet, and separate
outlet.

But even this solution is flawed if the vehicle is subjected to a
great deal of start &amp; stop driving, since the air flow through
the cooler is a function of engine speed.  Given the heat latency
of oil, a rather poor coolant by any measure, in stop &amp; go
driving the cooler must be provided with the largest possible air
flow when the vehicle is at a stand-still.  This can only be
accomplished with a fan, which in turn dictates a remotely
mounted cooler, the necessary plumbing, thermostatic controls and
so forth.  Such refinements fly in the face of conventional
wisdom, which tends more toward lots of chrome, lowered front
ends, five hundred watt sound systems and other symptoms of
feeblemindedness.

The worst-case cooling scenario is the installation of a 2.2
liter engine in an early bus used to haul heavy loads in hilly
terrain.  Reliable long-term performance was achieved by remotely
mounting a 10 x 14 inch steel oil cooler and using a 12&quot; diameter
thermostatically controlled fan.  Air-scoops mounted over the
engine compartment air-inlet louvers provide positive pressure to
the engine compartment any time the vehicle is moving faster than
8 mph, forcing air through the cooler, which is mounted on a
sheetmetal housing fastened to the floor of the engine
compartment to the left of the engine, exiting downward through
an 8 x 10&quot; hole behind the left rear wheel well.  In stop and go
traffic, or when climbing long grades, the fan cycles on and off
as required to keep the oil temp below 230 degrees Fahrenheit.
(Normal temp is about 180.)

When building a large displacement engine you must address the
cooling problems from the outset, starting with a late-model
crankcase having larger oil passages.  Particular attention must
be paid to your cylinder heads, insuring none of the air passages
are blocked by casting flash, especially in the area around the
exhaust ports.  The cylinders must be tightly shrouded; the stock
deflector plates are not adequate to insure a laminar flow of air
over the greatest possible surface of the cooling fins.  You need
the late-model 'Kool-tin' type shrouds, modified as necessary to
insure a leak-free fit.  The air-vanes in the blower housing
should be re-worked, even to installing bronze bushings if the
pivots are worn.  When the blower housing is assembled you must
insure the link rod causes both sets of vanes to open fully and
at the same rate.  The thermostat and actuating rod must be
positioned so as to insure proper operation without any
possibility of binding.  You must do everything possible to
insure maximum heat flow from the valve covers, crankcase and
push-rod tubes.  The fan pulley must never be smaller than stock.

And of course you must build a proper engine, insuring all
rotating components are dynamically balanced as a unit, that you
choose a rod length so as to reduce piston side-load, and that
pistons and rods are balanced to better than factory spec.
Hydraulic cam-followers should be fitted as a matter of course.
Most importantly (and assumed throughout) is that the engine be
fitted with a full-flow oil filtration system.  Indeed, aside
from its application and overall appearance, there is very little
Volkswagen in a reliable 2180cc VW engine.

One of the most difficult tasks when assembling an engine is to
insure proper volumetric balance.  This applies to engines of any
size but is especially important when building larger engines.
Your deck heights should be identical.  This is most easily
accomplished through the use of shims, with the final adjustment
made by shaving the head of the piston (but no more than a few
thou, please.  And always BEFORE balancing.)  Chamber volume
should match very closely and the chambers should be polished.
For maximum longevity, compression ratio should be kept fairly
low, typically between 7.3 to 7.5.  Achieving volumetric balance
is more important than nailing down a precise compression ratio.

Building an engine is a satisfying experience and the simplicity
of the Volkswagen virtually insures success, even for first time
builders.  But that only applies to stock engines, and doesn't
speak to long-term durability at all.  The generally poor
reliability of big-bore engines stems largely from ignorance of
the problems involved.  The stock 1600 VW engine is virtually
maxed-out with regard to cooling capacity.  Bigger engines are
DIFFERENT ENGINES, demanding different solutions to their cooling
problems.
