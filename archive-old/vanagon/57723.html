well, here we go again. I'm game.

Dates:
I'd vote for end of april, start of may, pretty much anything *before*
Memorial Day Weekend (when everyone wants to get out of Dodge for the
weekend.)
Besides the PNW Folklife Festival is that weekend...

Locations:
Hell, just about anywhere that I don't have to chain up to get to is fine
with me at this point. Maybe a strategy is to take a straw poll on possible
attendees, then try to select a location equidistant (approximately) to
them all? Or else pick a place that everyone will *want* to go to. Such as?
(If it's a place that allows for offroad bicycling that would be even better!)

I've mentioned a few places around here that I know about, but I'm sure
there are plenty more. (I would like to find out more about areas in the
Oregon desert country - I haven't been that way for years. Might be better
for another time though.)
