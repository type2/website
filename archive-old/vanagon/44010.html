Subject: Holland MI VW Show

Hi!  I'm heading to western Michigan on vacation (Muskegon area) with the
fam soon and I noticed in my GASS mag that there is a show in Holland on
June 22 (Worldwide Day of the Beetle no less).  Can anyone familiar with the
show give me an idea about it.  Is the swap area good?  How many show cars
are expected?  Is it worth attending?  

I'm even considering driving my '68 vert up (in addition to the family
wagon).  That's not practical but it should be fun.

'71 crew cab (HELP ME. I'm still looking for those drop gates!!)
