So William Abbott says:
&gt; 	Friends,
&gt; 	You'll recall my sweetie and I were doing body work on the
&gt; pickup together, and I had to share this with everyone since it made
&gt; me so happy. Well, now there's more.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Jean and I went up to visit my dad and step-mother a couple 
&gt; of weeks ago. Having had a very nice evening together, I felt that I
&gt; had shown or told her everything she needed to know about me, and 
&gt; asked her to marry me after we had driven back to my house. Where I actually
&gt; proposed was kneeling in the walkway betweeen the two front seats of
&gt; my brother and sister-in-law's Vanagon, which I'd traded my car for earlier
&gt; that day to haul rain gutters. :)
&gt; 
&gt; 	She said yes! She's looking forward to driving the pickup too!
&gt; 
&gt; 	Really, I didn't plan it this way, but that's how it worked out.
&gt; I'd say its an auspicious beginning too.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Cheers!

Congratulations Bill!

Now we can tie beer cans to the back of you pick-em-up!!! ;)
