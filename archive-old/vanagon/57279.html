&gt; I was curious about the comment that the WBX's in the US were
&gt; all only 4 speed except for diesel and syncros.Is that the situation
&gt; stateside?

Yes. In the USA:
Manual transmissions in 1980-1982 aircooled Vanagons were all 4 speed.
Manual transmissiona in 1982-1983 diesels were mostly 4 speed, few 5 speed.
    (Automatics were not offered with the diesels.)
Manual transmissions in 1983.5-1991 waterboxers were all 4 speed.
Manual transmissions in 1986-1991 Syncros were all 4 speed + Low gear.

&gt; All 2WD Waterboxers imported into Australia were all 5 speed
&gt; (with a real 5th gear not an overdrive)and as far as I am aware that
&gt; was the case from 1984 on.

Interesting, 4 speeds in USA and 5 speeds in Australia.  Wonder why?

&gt;Syncros are all 4 speed plus a crawler gear as in
&gt; the US. 

As far as I know, all Syncros worldwide used the same trans, but with a few
variations in gear ratios and/or final drives.

&gt;I was interested as it seems you guys were treated much more
&gt; poorly than in Oz.We got Panel Vans,Window Vans,Caravelles,Carats,
&gt; Single Cabs,Double Cabs,Hightops and Syncros (in any of the above body
&gt; shapes)and ALL were 5 speed except for(obviously)autos &amp; syncros.
&gt; Also all Double Cabs were 4 door from '88 on (correct me someone if I'm
&gt; wrong)

That's quite a selection.  I'm envious!!
