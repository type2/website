Subject: Fiberglass

Hi All

I'm trying to locate some info on the web, on how to build things in fiberglass.
The idea is, to replace some of the body plats whit fiberglass.

Anyone have any info, please email me. 

Ps. At the moment I'm in the process of doing some rust job on my camper,
and I feel that some of the places can be replaced by fiberglass. 

Best Regards
