&gt;&gt;Is there a company that either refinishes steering wheels.  The
&gt;&gt;enamel (?) is worn off the '57's and I'd like it fixed.  I hear
&gt;&gt;though that the wheel doesn't come off exactly easy.  Is there a
&gt;&gt;place that sells repro's?

Both Rocky Mountain Motorworks (The Bus Stop) and POR-15 sell steering
wheel restoration kits. ($24.95 at the Bus Stop) Don't know more than that.
