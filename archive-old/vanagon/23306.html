                      RE&gt;&gt;Propane                                  8/23/95

If you look at it this way - 20 amps at 12 volts  = 240 watts. 

Now - the little 'frigde in my office (a small cube 18&quot; on an edge) draws 1.1
amps at 120 VAC. =&gt; 132 watts (I know, I am ignoring starting surge and power
factor - but again close enough in rough terms for steady state conditions).  


Now -  the office fridge is a mechanical compressor, while the multi power RV
coolers run some kind of heat driven expansion cycle that I am always looking
up and then forgetting the details on.  My recollection is that the mechanical
compressor cycle is much more efficient, and it generally operates while
trying to pump heat into an air conditioned office maintained at around 72
degrees.  Your camper cooler is in a typically much warmer environment (more
heat leaking into the cold box) and at the same time trying to pump heat from
the inside of the box into (I'm guessing) the inside of the vehicle(?) or into
a flue that leads outside but probably is generally at an ambient higher than
72 degrees due to solar heating, and other waste heat sources.

I guess what I conclude from all of this is that :
1)  20 amps wouldn't surprise me - and in fact, it is probably artifically
limited to that so as not to really draw excessive loads on the vehicle
electrical system, (and for full cooling I wouldn't be surprised if 40 amps
were required).   Typical standard automotive  alternator outputs are 40 -60
amps, but these ratings are usually PEAK or surge ratings, and there are
additional loads that must be considered at the same time as the cooler's
load, such as recharging batteries, running the ignition, headlights, A/C,
etc.
2)  it would be interesting to convert propane burn rate/temp into BTUs and
then into equivalent watts to see if the power input from propane and 12 are
equal  (anybody out there up to that task?  My theoretical education is
'lektrikal (my practical vocation is sumthin' else!)
3)  Given the differences in operating environments and efficiencies, I am not
surprised that RV coolers, especially on 12 volts have trouble cooling well on
warm days especially when full of stuff that may need to be cooled down (warm
beer?) and particularly if when running on 12 volts vs propane the cooler is
running at a lower cooling rate.
4)  Toyota mini vans used to have a neat small compartment up between the
front seats that was immersed in the cold air stream from the vehicle's A/C
and could be used to cool a 6 pack or sandwiches etc.  Conceptually not a bad
idea.  The engine driven mechanical refirgeration cycle is much more efficient
than the head driven cooling cycle that I can never remember, and directly
mechanically driven off the engine, even more so.  If I were serious about a
fridge in a van that's how I would cover the case when the engine was running,
 - don't know about what to do when you were parked away from shore power
though.

Just my $0.02  ramblings. &quot;nuff.
