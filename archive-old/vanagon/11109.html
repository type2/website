Subject: Back on heating

     Hi all,
     
     You may remember the water heater box idea a few weeks ago.
     
     Well I didn't get a J-pipe from the Santa Pod meet coz the SOB at the 
     J-pipe stall wouldn't sell me just one! I had to buy two, so I gave 
     him the bird.
     
     Another idea I've thought of though is this:
     
     When I start my engine from cold the heater boxes are still cold (well 
     barely hot anyway) after 5 minutes. However the heat exhausting from 
     the tinware at the bottom is damn hot after five minutes. So check out 
     my latest ASCII design:-
     
     
             cool air
           /          \
          /  _________ \__
          | |    |    | ----&gt;
          | |____|____| &lt;----- Cylinders (don't laugh cos they're square)
          |             ----&gt;
          \____________ ----&gt; Hot engine cooling air
     
     
     Ok so that's the stock setup now suppose I put a small radiator on the 
     hot air flow ala:
     
     
             cool air
           /          \
          /  _________ \__   water in
          | |    |    |  __/
          | |____|____| |  |
          |        ---&gt; |  | ---&gt; hot engine cooling air
          \____________ |__|
                            \ hot? water out
     
     
     Two pipes upto the front with a radiator/fan setup and a water pump to 
     pump it round.
     
     You could even have a radiator on both sides of the engine to collect 
     from both hot air outlets. I guess they shouldn't actually be called 
     &quot;radiators&quot; though more like &quot;heat exchangers&quot;.
     
     So any comments??
