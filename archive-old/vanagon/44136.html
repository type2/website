Subject: The Mystery Machine Lives..but costs

        Just got 'the call' from the auto place. I'm very disheartened. As
it turns out the van not starting was caused by 2 things. 1) My oxygen
sensor was toast, and 2) I need a new voltage relay for the battery.
Together with the towing cost and labor it came to $350 in repairs.
AAAAARRGH! And Ive only had the damn thing a month.
        And then to add to the whole sinking gut feeling he tells me &quot;you
need new brake pads, rotors and new front tires, but if your not about to
ake any long trips you could postpone it for a bit.&quot; Well well well..just
my luck that I have to leave on hoidays at the end of next month, so YES I
will need to get that done I spose sometime in the next while which means
that yet another load o' cash will be spent.
        Unless.......how hard is it to but on new rotors and brake pads?
Can I get good used ones (I wouldnt think so but I'll ask anyhow)? From
what my mechanic informed me he said new brake pads will be $40/pair,
rotors will be $200/pair, and $100 in labor. I;d like to aviod the later if
possible.
        He said that new tires would cost around #160 each.

Does this all sound on the level or what? An dcould I do some of this work
myself? Any help would be appreciated in this...my time of great sorrow. I
was prepared for some little problems, but not a grand worth in one month!
And it had to be the month I was moving!

disgruntled yet stillll in love with the van,
mike
