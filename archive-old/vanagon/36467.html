&gt; Sorry for the preliminary post- closer inspection shows a leaking fuel line
&gt; above starter motor.  It is leaking at the junction directly above the
&gt; starter, on the line that runs from the fuel pump forward.
&gt; 
&gt; Working from the rear of the car to the front, a metal fuel line goes through
&gt; a metal anchor point at the front of the engine compartment, and is clamped
&gt; to about an inch and a half of rubber hose.  Out from that is another metal
&gt; tube, that goes a couple inches into some sort of flexible tubing, without a
&gt; hose clamp.  This flexible stuff is darkened with gasoline for the last inch
&gt; or so.  That is where the leak is, I assume.
&gt; 
&gt; It only leaks with the car running.
&gt; 
&gt; Questions:
&gt; 
&gt; How hard is this line to replace.  It's up there and looks like kind of a
&gt; pain in the *ss.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm assuming I should not drive at all, as the leaking fuel would be near the
&gt; exhaust pipes.
&gt; 
&gt; Any tips or tricks or advice?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks

&gt; .- Replaceing fuel line is alot cheaper than replaceing your van!! There 
is a plstic fitting up on the front of the engine were two lines are 
hose clamped to, about were you are describing the leak. It is best to 
use two people to diag this problem, one turns on the key(making fuel 
leak) and the other inspects the area of the leak. With the starter 
right there and the exaust I wouldn't drive the van until completely 
fixed.FUEL LINE IS CHEAP,FIRES ARE EXPENSIVE.
