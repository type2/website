Ok,,
	Got the side plate put on and the reduction box back together!  A brief
moment of panic after I got it all bolted up snug, and it wouldn't turn!
Turns out the stub axle and bearing were a little crooked, so I loosened
up and up straightened it out.

	I actually have the tranny boltedup in the car, and it now waiting for
starter, brakes, fluid and engine
