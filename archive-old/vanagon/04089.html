Subject: RE: Trip Report (Summer Trip - Jon Ulrig)

hi there
     new face to the net...:-), but i've got a summer story.  This summer in
fact.  I'm from PA, went to Atlanta for a party for memorial day weekend.----
oh, this trip took place in the never fogetful Bess--my '70 camper van.
After atlanta--&gt;thru missouri and kentucky (beautiful in summer)  --&gt; Aspen, Co
 over independence pass (has anyone ever tried this in a van?--don't!)  hiking,
 biking,etc --&gt;bryce, zion, canyonlands, Arches NP's, Moab, --&gt;north and south
rim of grand canyon (hiked it)--&gt;Las Vegas (saw the Dead there--it was HOT)
--&gt;Tahoe --&gt;back to Denver--&gt;New Mexico (where i found a place called,believe
it or not, Armand Hammer World College, hmmmmm?---&gt;Austin TX (great blues)
--&gt;Florida, where outside of Gainesville a couple of kids hit me from behind
and totaled my van :-(  --&gt;i was spun almost the entire way 'round, the
engine actually fell out of the van and was dragged for about 200yards.  After
checking out the damage, i also noticed that the entire thing was crumpled like
 an acordian --wrinkles on the inside on the ceiling.  UGH!! what a way to end
an otherwise amazing trip.
   So, needless to say, i am in the market for a new (old) van.  Am actually
looking for a '66 or older -- you know split window type...anyone hears of
anything, please let me know.
