Good to hear the price of struts is coming down. I looked into
replacing mine a few years ago and refused to pay the big bucks. My
solution? I cut ~1ft of pvc plastic pipe and slipped one strut through
it. When I open the rear hatch the pvc locks it open. Works great and
you get a good workout lifting that heavy hatch at the same time!
