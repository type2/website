&gt; If I am correct, the only colors a '74 Westfalia came in were your
&gt; orange for the standard and Yosimate(sp?) Yellow for the Deluxe camper.
&gt; 
&gt; (but the yellow looks green to me too!)

  You are correct, I think. It is that very light, chartreuse like green to
  which I was referring. Can you elaborate on the relationship between colors
  and equipment levels? It's true that mine is a standard and it is orange.
  Sami's '75 is &quot;Yosemite Yellow&quot; and it is a deluxe. Is this always the case?
  I will never be able to get a green standard? Bummer. Maybe I should get a
  '78 and move the camping gear from the '74 over.
