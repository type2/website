Wow. (for the metric-impaired, -10C is 14F, and -20C is -4F.) Quite extreme
temperatures for around here but something it should be able to handle.
Perhaps that's why so many of these vehicles are migrating to the Left
Coast?

The compressor comes on for defrost because its trying to dehumidify the
air, which will defrost the window a bit quicker. There is always an &quot;air
drier&quot; in the A/C loop. I'm not sure if the eBago does this but it wouldn't
surprise me any.

I haven't had mine in any extreme heat or cold yet, I'm certainly looking
forward to it now! Of course, I'm coming from an air-cooled with an aux
heater, no A/C, so it heats fine but it sure was hot in the summer! Point
is, my scale of acceptability may be lower than yours! Maybe its time for a
trip to the mts to see how it handles the cold.

Have you tried driving with the furnace on? (Sorry I couldn't resist.)

My only (constructive) suggestion  would be to press them on it. You're
being in Canada means you can't call our FTC, but is there any kind of
&quot;lemon law&quot; there?
Contact the dealer and VW, via registered mail, requesting a solution.
Start treating this as a formal complaint, documenting each step and
response. Eventually, you'll either have a solution, or much of the
documentation you need to file a formal legal complaint and/or civil suit
against them.

As for the controls: I didn't like it at first that you couldn't direct air
at both body and feet at same time, unless you're running with A/C on as
well. But reading the manual indicates that the A/C is shut down when
ambient air is below 40F so those other positions on the switch are usable.

There's a lot of exploring under the hood with this thing which I have not
done yet. One of the reasons I bought it is I just don't have the time to
be constantly tweaking things. Hell, I've barely put many miles on it yet,
and am still pondering over whether to change the oil *before* VW says to
in the breakin cycle (not before 7000 miles according to them!) Life's
tough I know.
