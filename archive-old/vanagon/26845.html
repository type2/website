Subject: Color wiring diagrams?

  I bought a Bentley manual about 10 years ago.  It had some very
nice color wiring diagrams in the middle of the book.  Over the
years, the book's spine cracked and the diagrams were lost.
  I replaced the book last fall; now I have a clean copy and a 
filthy copy. The new wiring diagrams are in black and white, like 
the rest of the book.  I called Bentley and they said they did
the B&amp;W diagrams to save money.  (Their prices have not changed.)

  Would anyone with an old color wiring diagram be willing to make a
color copy for us?  I have a '73 Type2 Campmobile (built in May 1973).
