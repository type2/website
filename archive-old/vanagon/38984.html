Subject: dim tail lights

Greetings,

I there an easy way to brighten my tail/brake lights? I took the lenses
off, replaced the bulb with the standard 1147 (I think that's the number),
cleaned and polished the reflector and cleaned off the lens, but the lights
are really quite dull. Can I use a higher wattage bulb, or will that tax
the line/fuse?

I notice this everytime I drive behind another bus in the San Francisco fog.
Ken
