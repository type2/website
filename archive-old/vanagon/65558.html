Subject:      Re: Exhaust Leak? '90 Westy

Hello Folks,

Well , looks like I fell for the oldest Westy joke in the book! Turns out
the &quot;sound&quot; was simply a stuck lifter. Nothing that a short Sunday
afternoon drive couldn't take care of!

Keep on Truckin'

&gt;Hey folks,

&gt;Well, I got up this beautiful Sunday morning, here in Northern California,
&gt;me and the wife got dressed up in our Sunday best for church and when I
&gt;went out to start up the Westy I heard the &quot;sound&quot;.  Sounds like an exhaust
&gt;leak, but I have not checked her out to be sure (going to do that right
&gt;now). Sounds like a loud external ticking, much like the normal motor sound
&gt;amplified. Can anyone concur with such little data? She only has 6k on a
&gt;brand new motor.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, assuming this is in fact an exhaust leak how serious is the matter?
&gt;To put things in perspective I am planning on a trip to Medford Oregon next
&gt;week (600-700 miles) and I am not sure I can fix it unless I have to.
&gt;
&gt;Any advice?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!
