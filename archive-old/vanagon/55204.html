Subject: Front Blower fan?????

I was wondering if I should try to attempt to change the front blower fan
my self or let the Vw dealer do it for me? My fan has just died! We still
have another month and a half left of this cold stuff here in Northern
Ontario. I can't get my hands on one of those service books here in Sudbury
so I would have to guess on how to take the dash appart.
