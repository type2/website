Subject: Castrol?



To the greatest repository of eclectic knowledge in the 
cyberspace universe (aka:vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu)

Does anyone happen to know of an e-mail address for the sports
division of Burmah Castrol(the oil people).  Do they maybe have
a website?  I'm trying to find a cataloge of their old racing
films.

Thanks in advance...
