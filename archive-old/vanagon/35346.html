Subject:  VW parts on CD-ROM

** Reply Requested When Convenient **

Hey all,

I went to the local VW dealer the other day to order a couple of VW
parts.  They had a really neat computer program where you look up the
specific vehicle that you're trying to locate parts for, you look up the
general area of the car using keywords and then you get a nice
exploded view of a certain system with part numbers and all.  For
instance, I needed the little hose that pressurizes the windshield washer
tank, so he entered Type 2 into the computer, then &quot;washer&quot; and then
picked windshield washer from the list.  Then appeared on the screen a
nice exploded view of the whole windshield washer system and I was
able to point out to the guy which hose it was that I needed.  It was really
cool!  I asked him if it was on CD-ROM and he said it was.  Now why
doesn't VW sell this CD-ROM to customers like we???  Also, this
particular CD-ROM wasn't just for air-cooled VWs.  I think it had EVERY
VW ever on there.  It was pretty comprehensive.  

They need to get us those CD-ROMs!

Sean
