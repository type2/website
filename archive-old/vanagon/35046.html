&gt;Recreation called today and drew me into the deep country to go hiking, the
&gt;last stretch of road was a muddy uphill &quot;road.&quot;  Not much traction, quite a
&gt;bit of spinning, but constant motion, i was never stuck.  Before hitting
&gt;this road the vanagon's temp gauge was on the white line at the bottom, nice
&gt;and cool.  After driving up this muddy uphill road for awhile the temp got
&gt;up to the mid mark, which is the highest I have seen since the summer.
&gt;After awhile the oil light started to flicker.  I do have 20w50 in there
&gt;(and enough of it too, checked it before i left), so that pretty much rules
&gt;out that cause (it wasn't idleing either).  I immediatly shut it off and
&gt;went to the engine compartment, it smelled burnt, checked the oil, looked
&gt;underneath for drips or flowing oil, looked in the coolant tank for any oil,
&gt;as best as i could, anything which could be the cause the loss in oil
&gt;pressure.
&gt;
&gt;I did my hiking all the while worrying and came back and crossed my fingers
&gt;and it started right up and no problems at all.  I don't think i really
&gt;overheated it, but the flickering oil light was the big question mark.
&gt;
&gt;A friend of mine who drove the same stretch of road had the same exact
&gt;problem, mid range coolant temp and an oil light, however his vehicle was a
&gt;70's dodge volare.  I did also see a caravan/voyager on the side of the road
&gt;with the hood up, probably over-heated also.
&gt;
&gt;ideas?

Couple of questions for clarification.  Doesn't temparature gauge usually
read near the middle of the gauge?  It should if the thrmostat and all are
working properly.  Did the radiator fan come on?  At what gear/RPM were you
running the engine at.  In the Vanagon engine,  Oil temparature soars with
RPM and load.  Coolant temp is not related to oil temp under high stress
conditions.  If engine was running at 4000rpm for an extended period and the
coolant temp went to 200 waiting for the fan to come on, the oil temp.
probably reached 280 or higher un less you've added an oil cooler.  2.1 liter
engines with the factory oil/water heat exchanger reach 260 or so under these
conditions.  Regarding the oil level,  how full is it?  Keeping the oil
between the marks will keep the oil cooler than filling to the top line.
 Anything over the top line is a &quot;REAL PROBLEM&quot;.  1/4 inch above the line
will cause the oil to go out of control, 280 or more under normal conditions.
 I would check the oil pressure switch and while there, I would hook up an
oil pressur gauge and get an idea of the engines condition.  Test engine cold
to see that relief valve works and when hot. Drive at speed to get oil warm.
 You should hold about 10psi at idle if engine is healthy.  In general, 10psi
for each 1000rpm is rule of thumb.  Most waterboxers can hold 50 psi with the
20w-50 oil.
Hope this helps,
Dennis.
