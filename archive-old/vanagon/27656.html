Subject: Re:  URGENT: NJ/NY Residents: paranoid hype

    Hey this is the kind of hocus pocus scare i've been waiting for.  
Lest go to NJ and buy all these VWs CHEAP!! We'll make alot of money 
selling them in NV or any other non &quot;smog paranoid&quot; state.

    This also will boost property values in neighboring states; all 
those NJ residents fleeing a socialist regime.

    I doubt NJ or anywhere else is so stupid to Ruin its economy by 
making it so hard on its workforce (blue collars); so sit back and 
enjoy a cool one in your lod VW. (:D

&gt;I've been this all over the place on the net and elsewhere recently.  
It
&gt;sounds pretty scary for us Jerseyite Vanagoons, and a bad precident 
for all.
&gt;Anyone around here know more about it?  Is it really as bad as it 
sounds?
&gt;
&gt;Maybe it's time for a move.  8-(
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&quot;Millions of Drivers to be affected by New Vehicle Confiscation Law.&quot;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;On June 2, 1995, Governor Whitman signed legislation #SCS-1700.  It 
is 
&gt;&gt;NOW LAW, and will be fully implemented against all New Jersey car and 

&gt;&gt;truck owners as soon as the necessary testing facilities and remote 
&gt;&gt;monitoring stations are constructed, expected sometime in 1996-1997.  

&gt;&gt;Briefly SCS-1700 states the following.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;All motor vehicles over four years old will report to new Centralized 

&gt;&gt;Testing facilities for &quot;Enhanced Emissions Inspections.&quot;  If your car 
or 
&gt;&gt;truck fails this test, the vehicle MUST be taken off the road.  Only 
&gt;&gt;three percent of those vehicles failing the test and having spent a 
&gt;&gt;minimum of $450 for repairs will be granted a waiver allowing them to 

&gt;&gt;remain on the road for two more years.  You have no appeal and no 
other 
&gt;&gt;options.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Now for the Bad news.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Motor vehicles will cost $24.  The I/M Enhanced Emissions Test, in 
which 
&gt;&gt;an operator drives you car through a simulated dynometer test is 
designed 
&gt;&gt;to fail 60% of cars, this according to the EPA.  Almost no vehicles 
over 
&gt;&gt;10 years old are expected to pass.  You have no protection against 
damage 
&gt;&gt;or the destruction of your vehicle by such stress testing methods.  
97% 
&gt;&gt;of those vehicles failing the new enhanced emissions test will have 
their 
&gt;&gt;registration renewal automatically denied by the state.  Such 
vehicles 
&gt;&gt;cannot be sold to any other individual or dealer and essentially 
become 
&gt;&gt;FORFEITED TO THE STATE., which will receive 'pollution credits' they 
can 
&gt;&gt;sell to industrial polluters for every vehicle they take off the 
road.  
&gt;&gt;Owners of failed vehicles must surrender their license plates within 
45 
&gt;&gt;days...And since NJ law already prohibits you from having an 
unregistered 
&gt;&gt;vehicle on your own property, local law enforcement can then seize it 
at 
&gt;&gt;will.  Assisting in this effort, NJ DEP recently revised the state's 
&gt;&gt;definition of &quot;quasi-public&quot; to include ALL residential driveways and 

&gt;&gt;parking lots.  YES, you've lose your private property rights.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Repairs can only be attempted by a STATE CERTIFIED REPAIR 
FACILITY...to 
&gt;&gt;which you have no say about work quality or cost.  You can no longer 
&gt;&gt;legally perform emissions related repairs yourself, nor can you take 
it 
&gt;&gt;to your trusted mechanic (unless they first receive state 
certification 
&gt;&gt;and invest $100,000 in equipment).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;As part of SCS-1700, roadblocks will be established through the state 
to 
&gt;&gt;randomly test a percentage of all vehicles.  Automated sensing 
devices 
&gt;&gt;will be installed along New Jersey highways to monitor your vehicles 
&gt;&gt;emissions as you drive by.  Violators of the new emmisions new stands 

&gt;&gt;will have their license plate photographed!  Thus enabling the state 
to 
&gt;&gt;issue summons through the mail.  Severe penalties, fines, and jail 
time 
&gt;&gt;have been attached to all violates of this new legislation.  IN fact, 

&gt;&gt;the state will be kicking back a commission to local police for their 
help 
&gt;&gt;in seizing your car.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Remember, SCS-1700 is aimed at TAKING YOUR CAR OFF THE ROAD!  It is 
aimed 
&gt;&gt;at producing one car families.  Collector, hot rod, and hobbyist cars 
are 
&gt;&gt;history.  A spare car for local trips, a teenage driver, student, or 
the 
&gt;&gt;commuter park and ride is history.  The classic Mustang convertible 
has 
&gt;&gt;been redefined as a 'gross polluter' and is now targeted by the state 
for 
&gt;&gt;the crusher.  Many car and truck related businesses will suffer or 
fail.  
&gt;&gt;Ironically, state officials are now recommending you start saving 
your 
&gt;&gt;money now to buy a new car, an impossibility for most individuals 
given our 
&gt;&gt;total tax burden of around 50%.  
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The issue here is ever increasing government controlling not only 
your 
&gt;&gt;mobility, your life, and your freedom, but even your ability to work, 
and 
&gt;&gt;earn a living.  It has almost nothing to do with clean air.  Remember 

&gt;&gt;that you have NO LEGAL RIGHT TO DRIVE in this state.  New Jersey 
&gt;&gt;considers it their PRIVILEGE to allow you to drive on their 
roads...and 
&gt;&gt;starting sometime in 1996, they will be taking it back.  As state by 
EPA 
&gt;&gt;region 8 administrator William Yellowtail, &quot;Cleaning up cars on the 
roads 
&gt;&gt;is only half the solution...the much more difficult part involves 
getting 
&gt;&gt;people out of their cars.&quot;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Sound far fetched?  Can't Happen?  Remind you of a Soviet or Nazi 
style 
&gt;&gt;police state?  FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF.  Call legislative services at 
&gt;&gt;1-800-792-8630 and ask for a free copy of SCS-1700.  Ask for your 
&gt;&gt;legislator's phone number and voice your concern.  Call DMV director 
Dick 
&gt;&gt;Kamin at 1-609-984-9827 and request all administrative and DEP 
&gt;&gt;regulations associated with SCS-1700.  Call Governor Whitman at 
&gt;&gt;1-609-292-6000. Ask for a repeal of this horrendous legislation.  
Most 
&gt;&gt;importantly, SPREAD THE WORD!  Copy and distribute this flyer 
&gt;&gt;everywhere.  Fax it to business associates.  Warn your friends.  Till 

&gt;&gt;now, you've heard few details regarding SCS-1700.  Since politicians 
&gt;&gt;desperately want to keep the nightmare they've rammed through the 
&gt;&gt;legislature quiet until after you re-elect them.  Remember this 
election 
&gt;&gt;day, that you finally have an alternative to the Two party system 
that 
&gt;&gt;once again stomped all over your rights...and VOTE!
