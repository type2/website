I think most people would agree that VW micro buses are a sacred part of
American automotive history, and should never be messed with.  But
unfortunatly, there are people that like stealing things, no matter what kind
of vehicle it's in.  I had a 1 month old boom box in my bus one night, and I
left one of the pop-out windows open for some fresh air.  Well, it seems that
someone REALLY needed my boombox, for they removed the 2 screws on the
pop-out lock and climbed in the window.  I think they were hoping to open the
double doors, but I always lock it from the outside, so the only way to open
them is to unlock them from the outside. :) I was actually happy that they
didn't break a window and that they only took the radio (with one of my
favorite CDs in it). 

So, lock it.

Of course there have also been the nights where I left it unlocked and 
nothing happened.  So, YMMV.
