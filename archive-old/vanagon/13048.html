&gt;Perhaps someone on the list could help me.  I want to sand down some
&gt;of them rust spots on my '84.  Then prime and repaint.  Unfortunately,
&gt;when I took a look yesterday things were worse than I had thought.
&gt;After scraping of some of the areas I could see that it was necessary to
&gt;use some kind of filler material as I will have some holes to contend
&gt;with.  Six years in Ithaca, N.Y. were not kind to my van! :-(.  Is
&gt;there a good book or reference which can guide me through the appropriate
&gt;steps?  I'm planning on keeping my van for a long time and have put this
&gt;off for the last time.  Your help is greatly appreciated.
