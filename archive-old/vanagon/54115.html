&gt; Isn't Poor Richard from that area? He's been sort of MIA lately.
&gt;
I am indeed around here, and have already extended a super-warm NC welcome to
the esteemed Mr. VanBondo. Which, if anyone else is in the area, feel free to
let me know, and I'll be happy to welcome you as well! (I'm actually in
Raleigh, a bit away from Charlotte, but still)

&gt; ....still waitin' for more list stickers :-)
I'm still looking into the Coffee Mug thing. I think I've found a good source,
so I'm trying to nail down a few prices before going public. Better start
saving those pennies, as Ken is getting Type II list merchandise ready as
well...
Get those Christmas presents early for next year!
