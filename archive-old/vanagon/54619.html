Subject: Vanagon Eng Wire Harness needed 


Hello one &amp; all:

I'm looking for a new/used wiring harness (control unit multi-pin plug to
AFS, injectors, temp sensor, coil, etc.) that fits in the engine
compartment (not the full chasis harness!) for my 1982 Vanagon (aircooled,
fuel-injected, 2.0L stock, USA/Federal version). If you or anyone you know
has one laying around, I'd be VERY interested in taking it off their
hands.

The dealer (VW) wants $836 for a new one ! ... NO comment for fear of
offending the weak of heart.

The pins to the AFS on my current harness show no resistance (bad news)
which coincides well with the VERY high fuel-air mixture and VERY poor
idle, acceleration (yes!, everything else checks out, mechanical and
electronic as best as I determine).

Any &quot;givers&quot; ... Ron ?

Cheers, Chris
