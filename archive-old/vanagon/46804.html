Subject: Still Life with Westy Tent


I feel compelled to write this post because i was a such a stalwart
against the use of a Westy Tent.  for over a year i have had one,
sans poles, and was just never excited to get it set up.  they
seemed bulky, heavy, archaic, and smelly.  ironically, a description
that too closely resembles me.

Having recently built a set of poles and actually camped using the dang thing, 
i have to admit the error of my ways.  in short, they are Wonderful.  
they are not just a tent, as tents are everywhere.  what they do is 
double the interior living space inside the van.  being *attached* to 
the van makes an enormous utilitarian difference as one has 
bug-rain-and boogey monster free access to all your stuff.  we set up 
a square of carpet and placed a folding rocking chair in there!  now THAT's 
camping.  the kids have room to play in bad weather, guests can drop 
by for Elevensies, and when you want to go somewhere, you zip up and 
leave.

I'm using the tent, an early 70's model bigtop with our '87 Westy.  
The fit is not perfect but servicable.  As Tim Smith said, alignment 
has to be perfect.  I removed the plastic driprail bead and the 
rubber driprail clamp goes on much easier.  and it stays secure.  one 
word of caution-- after removing the plastic edging on the drip rail, 
take the time to get all the black gooey adhesive off.  i didn't  :(

Since the tent was old and mousy smelling, i soaked in the lake for 
about 6 hours and had the kids jump around on it a bunch to clean it. 
 this took all the mouse smell away and brightened up the fabric.  

We had the tent set up in our campground at the Winnipeg Folk 
Festival and in short, it was the star of the camping bay we were in. 
 Many people came by to see what that &quot;thing&quot; was and were impressed 
with the layout of the tent/van combination.  

to those of you who have even *thought* of wanting a tent, they ARE
worth the weight, bulk, and hassle.  those of you who have a tent 
already know this :)
