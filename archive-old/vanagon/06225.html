Subject: Raindrops keep fallin on my head ...

Aaaarrrg!
Last night rain clouds got together and conspired to drown my poor bus. My
bus (Helga) fought mightily, but they sent their little warriors through a
faulty seal in the sunroof. As she warmed up this morning, I opened the sun
roof and found about a quarter inch of water around the track. No problem,
right? WRONG! As we traveled along, I came to a stop on a decline. All of a
sudden water came rushing out of the leading edge of the sun roof. I'm
talking about a gallons worth, easily a gallons worth. It soaked both front
seats, the mats both fore and aft, and even the dash. Did anyone see that
video clip of the fire extinguisher going off during an NBA pre-game? It
felt like that. Where the hell was all that water hiding? Do you think it's
still there ...waiting for me?
