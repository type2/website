&gt; Howdy,
&gt; I tried posting the camping trip in the Type II list, but wasn't
&gt; succesful. Can someone who is in both list do it? I know there are many
&gt; Type II list members that would be interested.
&gt; I am shooting for the weekend of the 13/14 September. Interested people
&gt; please give me some feedback on this and on my suggestion of Eastern
&gt; Oregon.If this seems to be OK, I'll get more specific into possible
&gt; campgrounds. It would be nice to have dates and place(s) figured out
&gt; pretty soon.
&gt; I got two more Vanagon listees interested, on from CA and other
&gt; from...Texas!
&gt; Also, I'll contact my local VW club, VWofWO/Jack Manyard, to see if they
&gt; are into it.
&gt; Keep in touch,
&gt; Cris.
