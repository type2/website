Subject: '91 Westy gasoline heater

A friend in Vancouver has a '91 Westy with gasoline heater. The controls
for the heater are on the left side of the dash; little LCD display, as I
remember. Anyway, the thing is stock VW.

He hasn't got a clue as to how to use it. This brings up two questions:

1) Clearly the winter weather in Vancouver is not that bad, as he's had the
car for four years, and
2) I guess the manual didn't come with the car.

If someone can kindly send instructions, I'll forward them. What with
global warming coming any day now, it all seems academic to me, but you
never can tell.

TIA
