There is a kid in my 'hood that has a '67 kamper that he wants to get rid
of.

I has one &quot;rough area&quot; where some body work was done but not painted,
very-very little rust (under the winshield seal) but the rest of hte
body is pretty darn sweet.

It is missing the front windsheilds (someone stole his safaris) and is
likewise missing lights and engine.  I gave hime and engine lid and apron,
so I would imagine they go with the bus (although he hasn't put them
on)

He has the steering box out, which I imagine would go with it as well.

He was going to sell it ot another kid in the 'hood, but kid #2 (same one
with the blue '72) has no visible means of support, and it looks like the 
deal fell thru (I helped orchestrate it)

They'd agreed on $450

I don't really have any stake at all in this, I just want to see this bus
find a good home, someone whose not going to immediate lower/prime/wreck it
(not necessarily in that order)
