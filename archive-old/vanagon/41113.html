i am wanting to put in a deep-cycle for music listening, etc. while
camping, and would like to put it in as soon as i get the van back from the
shop, where it has been for the past month. as i don't have access to it,
does anybody know the maximum battery dimensions for fitting under the
driver's seat?  any brand preferrences?

thanks, matthew (81 adventurewagen)


I just recently faced the same problem and, near as I can tell, you are out of
luck.  The battery box is VERY small, only 7&quot; tall.  The ONLY battery which
will fit under the front seat is a group 42, which is NOT available as a 
deep cycle; only as a conventional starter battery.  

I posted a query on this list asking if anyone knew where to get a deep cycle
battery which would fit and got no responses.  The only &quot;fix&quot; is to get out
the old cutting torch and deepen the battery box.  For the moment, I just gave
up and purchased a &quot;conventional&quot; group 42 battery.  If all goes well with my
'80 Westy (a recent acquisition) maybe next year I will perform the required
surgery.
