&gt;Heads can be interchanged between 1800s and 2000s (1800 valves are bigger) but 
&gt;1700 heads only fit 1700s. 

Nope.  I took a set of heads from a 1700 in the junkyard and bolted them
right down on my 1800 engine.  I'm pretty sure they had not been flycut.

&gt; 			So, to make a displacement jump from a 1700 you have
&gt; to change everything but the case to get to two liters, and change barrels, 
&gt; pistons and heads to get to 1800 (the best of the bunch, in my opinion).

Again, you don't have to change heads to go from 1.7 to 1.8.  The most you
will have to do is have the heads flycut, but I don't think so.  I also
am almost positive that you can make a 1.8 into a 2-liter by using 2 liter
pistons, barrels, rods, and crank.  You can even cut down the old 1.8 liter
crank to a 2 liter one.  My source for this is &quot;How to rebuild your Air-
Cooled VW Engine&quot;, and numerous discussions with machine-shop guys.

My ultimate plan is this:

'73 1.7 heads, flycut if necessary for 94mm barrels.
	(74 heads not used becuase of egr ports)
'74 (larger) valves, sodium-filled for the exhaust
2-liter crank, rods, pistons, and liners
1.8 cam with solid lifters (apparently hydraulic lifters have a different
	cam profile, less power).

This should make a powerful, cool-running 2-liter engine which to the
untrained eye (i.e. smog mechanics) will be indistinguishable from the
stock 1.7 engine.
