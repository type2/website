I couldn't convince Roland Wilhelmy to put his head inside the engine
compartment while I cranked the Type I engine sitting all forlorn in the
Rocket's engine compartment, acres of open space on all sides, nice view of
the ground on three sides.  Big hole in the muffler.  I think the domed-shape
of the oil filler cap gave me away.

Checked the compression.  Interesting.
    #1 - 0
    #2 - 135
    #3 -   12  (mebbe 13)
    #4 - 0

With those kinds of numbers I didn't bother to check dwell, points or plug
gap.  We poured some juice in the brake reservoir, kicked it out of gear and
rolled it down the hill.  Used the come-along to pull her into the field
below the house.  Jacked her up, took off the rear bumper and pulled the
engine.

It looks pretty bad, Bert.  As in too many holes in the pistons, along with
no heads on some of the valves.  Otherwise, it was in pretty good shape -- no
oil leaks.  Of course, it didn't have any oil left to leak.  

The odd thing is, the engine looks fairly new and the serial is for a '72
sedan.  I've a hunch it was a good running engine, probably pulled from a
collision-damaged beetle and plugged into the bus.  The smog people condone
that sort of thing -- swapping engines between the same model year.  But
without engine compartment seals there was no way the thing could have
received a smog certificate.

In either case, it's a deader.  I'll tear her down and see if the crank or
case is salvageable.  Otherwise it's fuel for Martha's next wilderness do.
 The heads need valves, guides, welding and an Act of God.  Jugs are junk of
course.  Might be able to use the rear screw on the left cylinder tin, and
maybe the intake manifold ends.  Generator is shot -- commutator is seriously
scored, thanks to all the dirt sucked into the engine compartment.  Carb is a
Borsal 34, not worth the trouble to overhaul.  Old-style fuel pump already
has a kit in it -- might be good.  Distributor is trash until I can find a
replacement vacuum can.  Since the engine suffered a lubrication failure and
blown jug I can't reuse the oil cooler -- too much crap in it.  I haven't
seen the pump but it will probably be scored all to hell.  No thermostat or
air vanes of course.  Everybody knows you don't need that stuff.

I'll keep you posted on the Rocket's fate but don't expect a whirlwind
recovery.
