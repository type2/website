&gt;Hubal and his friends apparently had hiked up a ski run
&gt;called Stump Alley and undid some yellow foam protectors from
&gt;the lift towers, said Lieutenant Mike Donnelly of the Mammoth
&gt;Lakes Police Department.  The pads are used to protect skiers
&gt;who might hit the towers.  The group apparently used the pads
&gt;to slide down the ski slope and Hubal crashed into a tower.
&gt;It has since been investigated that the tower he hit was the
&gt;one with its pad removed.

lawsuit on *this* one???  (3*a*m???)
