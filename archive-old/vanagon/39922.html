Subject: RE: wiring diagrams for '73 super beetle?


&gt;  Does anyone know what manual has *good* wire diagrams?

The Bentley manuals are great for electrical diagrams, tho a little 
expensive.
Mine for the '80 V6anagon has saved me more than once already.
Colors even match up. Only thing they're missing is the connections
for cyls 5 and 6, and the radiator cooling fan. Next update will probably
include them.   ;-)

I think their title is &quot;Official Factory Service Manual&quot; or something close
to that. Available at VW dealers, JC Whitney, and many VW aftermarket
shops and mail order places.

 change that which I can, and the the firepower to make the difference.&quot;
