Subject: Re: throttle bodies - older motor with 85 tb?? 

&gt; Mine is late 85 build and the single switch is Underneath a plate located
&gt; directly under the throttle body.  The plate will have two small allen bolts:
&gt; one to loosen the switch underneath and one to rotate a small cam to adjust
&gt; it.
&gt; 

I see that in the Bentley, but it just ain't in my van, swear to god. 
 Looked carfully, looked for a wire to a missing switch carefully as 
well neither is apparent, but the wiring harness has been oddly 
modified in other places as well.  Still appears to be no switch on 
mine, I swear it.
