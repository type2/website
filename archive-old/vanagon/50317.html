Subject: Re: Free 57 point checkup?

I was a service manager at a VW dealership for about 8 years. This is a
semiannual (used to be anyway) mailer to try and drum up business. It's
about getting you in the door to take a look at your vehicle. No doubt they
will try to sell you some repairs or even hit you up for a new van. You are
not out anything for doing it, who knows you may even find out something
about your van you didn't know. It's a much better view underneath when the
vehicle is on a hoist. It's kindof hard to see everything when you're
crawling under your van.

&gt;Hi everyone.
&gt;
&gt;I received a postcard from a MPLS area VW dealer (Burnsville VW) offering a 
&gt;free 57 point inspection/check-up.  I'm wondering if anyone knows anything 
&gt;about this offer, or if it's just a local thing.  Please respond....
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
