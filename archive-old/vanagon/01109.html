Subject: Re: 87 vanagon exaust ??

&gt;I went under my newly acquired '87 Westfalia last evening to change the
&gt;two $10. gaskets between the manifold pipes and the right angle connector
&gt;piece and ended up removing the entire exaust system. 

A sadly familiar scene, except than large chunks of my exhaust removed 
thhemselves on a 900 mile trip at Xmas time!  The culprit in this appeared
to be one of those seven (7!) support struts that tie the heavy muffler bits 
to the engine. The strut had craccked through near the pipes, not very 
visible on a casual inspection. The ensuing vibration fatigue-cracked the 
pipes near the flanges on the heads and where the pipes siamese together. It 
looks like our high salt content winters in Canada speed this up over 
southern climes. 
        As for a Canadian supplier, a good one is Altrom Canada Ltd. in 
Ottawa. They used to take VISA from anyone and shipped quickly, but... the 
now are strictly wholesale accounts. Got a friend in the business? Or ask 
them for the nearest client in your area and setup something. Prices a two 
years ago where $150.00 CDN per pipe (versus $380_at_dealer) This is OEM stuff 
by the way.
        I was a student when my system went, so mine is patched obscenely, 
built around J-pipes $35.00/pair, misc. sections of muffler shop pipe and a 
muffler now mounted on the rear of the van, not on the motor! A piece of 
flexi pipe and some plumbing brass elbows complete the package. The muffler 
was $45.00 off the shelf. I don't even know what it fits, I just took a tape 
 measure to the muffler shop and bought one the same size as my blown VW 
one. I don't have the fancy flanges at each end, this alone saved $100.00 
over Midas! Additionally, the tailpipe cost $6.00 plus a $1.99 clamp. All 
said, if you got the bucks go OEM, my system needs fixing about once every 2 
months or 1000 miles, no fun. Expect to put out close to $1000 CDN from 
cylinder head to exhaust tip, and don't forget those support braces, only 
available from VW!  Good luck, keep me posted please!

        As a note to others in this predicament, or rapidly approaching it 
unknowingly CHECK YOUR BRACES, get'em welded, not brazed! If there is a lot 
of interest/need for exhaust pipes maybe a deal could be struck with a 
racing shop to bend up ten sets of pipes and weld up the flanges/siamese 
joints. The main problem with this when I ask has been the extremely tight 
radius bends that fit the pipes in around the water pump. Also hard to do 
without a new set of pipes as templates. Finally...   It peeves me to no end 
that I can get a full stainless steel sytem for my 1965 912 Porsche 
including the heat exchangers for less than the price of these three pipes!  
just a grumble....     tjs
