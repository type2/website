Subject: RE: '78 Bus, 2.0L head question? (fwd)

I have a 78 van as well, and the following quote comes from the Haynes
17/18/2000 manual, Page 16 Section 2, titled &quot;Items repairable,Engine
in vehicle.&quot; Paragraph 7 distinctly states, &quot;The valve clearance may be
adjusted but we do NOT subscribe to the theory that the heads may be
removed in-situ.&quot;

This means Haynes doesn't think it can be done, but if SOMEONE subscribes
to the idea (they must, if Haynes disagrees with it) then it could be 
possible. If it were me, I'd check it out with an independent VW shop,
not a dealer (who will tell you it can't be done, better bring it in to
them). Make sure you're honest with the shop and tell them you intend to
do it yourself. You'll probably get an honest answer as they'll know they
can't take you for any money time-wise.

Why do you want to pull the head for anyway?
I pulled the head on my 74 1700, and I dropped the motor. It wasn't
very hard.
Good luck,
C.
