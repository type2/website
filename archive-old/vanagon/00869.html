&gt;-----------------------------------------
&gt;1980 Vanagon and
&gt;1981 Vanagon                Built from 1980 Apr  to  1981 Apr
&gt;     Campaign 81V076000     No. Recalled: 92
&gt;     Campaign               Notification Date:     810422
&gt;     System:                Pop Top
&gt;     Vehicle Description:   Campers (Van Conversion)
&gt;     Description of Defect: During vehicle operation, the pop top
&gt;                            could loosen from its anchor due to wind
&gt;                            pressure.  It could open and separate
&gt;                            entirely from the vehicle.
&gt;     Consequence of Defect: Sudden opening of the pop top could be a
&gt;                            hazard to safe vehicle operation.  Complete
&gt;                            separation could cause an accident and
&gt;                            personal injury to other drivers.
&gt;                            NOTE: Until the problem is corrected, owner
&gt;                            is advised to avoid excessive wind pressure
&gt;                            against the pop top by driving at moderate
&gt;                            speeds.
&gt;     Corrective Action:     Dealer will inspect and, if necessary,
&gt;                            modify anchorages to make sure pop top will
&gt;                            be secured under normal operating conditions.

Thanks for this info Joel. 
I've seen at least a dozen pop-top campers that had their tops popped 
for the last time. My method of preventing this unexpected event is to 
add one or two nylon luggage straps to the outside of the roof. Most
auto part stores have these generic straps that will clip on to the roof 
drip rails.  A kind of 'belt and suspenders' approach ;-)   FWIW,
