Hi Volks,

What Ted didn't mention is that it is also his birthday this weekend!

&quot;Rumor&quot; has it he is turning 31 ;-&gt;

Maybe we could have a list B-Day bash for T'Bear!

&gt; 
&gt; Everyone and everyone's friends are invited to attend the Cincinnati VW
&gt; Club's  6th annual Bugfest show and go on  August 16 at the Tri-State
&gt; Dragway near Cincinnati Oh. Last year we had over 200 vehicles of all
&gt; types. Plenty of swappers. Primitive camping at the show site on Friday
&gt; night. List members Tony Moore, Charlie Ford, and myself are planning a
&gt; party and doing a turkey ( whole) on a grill, assuming it doesn't rain.
The
&gt; more the merrier. 
&gt; If anyone wants to come, I will be glad to furnish directions. Let me
know.
&gt; Live long and prosper  TBear
