Subject: Heal and tow, upright spin-on filters

	David Schwarze and someone else observed that the Audi 5000 
'uninteneded acceleration' pedal positions facilitated better heel-and-
toe manipulations. My size 13 EEs will heel and toe over a good 8 inch
space. As I approach 40, I've come to believe that if you're depending
on close-spaced pedals for safety, you're driving too fast. But you
might be better at it than I am. 
	I still think it its too loud, you're too old :)

	The Mexican beetle engine filter adaptors will not work with
stock exhaust but might with my extractor. After the wedding and we
get out my old house, some friends and I are thinking of another
Friday trip to Tijuana to visit the VW dealer. We'll probably take
the earliest flight in, cab to the downtown trolley station and
trolley down to the border, then walk across. Can anyone recomend other 
places of interest for a bunch of guys (2-5) on a walking tour of Tijuana?
Last time we walked up one side of the river and down the other, checking
out various retail businesses, and especially looking in bookstores
for VW manuals- no Bentley for the the Mexican-assembled products :(
	So why doesn't someone import these adaptors? Or are they
in fact the hunks'o'junk Bob Hoover has written so movingly about? 

	Bren of &quot;4 Amys and a GEX rebuild...&quot; fame has a fixed high-top
camper with fridge, etc. Sounds like a Safare Custom Camper- David's Boat's
kid sibling (Bren's is a 79). David, where's the ID plates on Da Boat?

	Happy motoring!
	Bill
