The clicking sound I heard from the rear axle reappeared this morning,
louder to the point that putting action off was impossible. Drove to the
local VW dealer (never been to a dealer before), I guessed at CV joints,
they guessed at CV joints, it was CV joints.

Got a pair of $175 rebuilt axles, have some shiny new parts under the
Campmobile. Seems to have more guts, drives differently.

With $165 labor and $26 tax, this all ran me about $560 -- Is that high
or low? Am I wrong to anticipate competent work from a VW dealer?
