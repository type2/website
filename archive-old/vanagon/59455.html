My dad just purchased a one owner '82 Westy with 78,000 miles.  Everything 
works and is there.  He paid $1,500.00.  $7,900.00 seems a little high to
me.

&gt; &lt;&lt;&gt;For sale 81 Westy at local vw dealer. Spoke to salesman who told 
&gt; &gt;me: Beige, 59,000 original miles, pop top with all camping except stove
&gt; &gt;(looks like it never had one). Smith VW is located in northern Delaware 
&gt; &gt;near where I live. If anyone would like more info I will try to get over

&gt; &gt;to drive/look at it. If interested call Pat Smith at Smith VW (302)
&gt; &gt;998-0131. $7900.00 Pat says is in great condition in and out and why
&gt; &gt;would a salesman lie?&gt;&gt;
