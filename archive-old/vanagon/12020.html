As much as I like this list, it's simply giving me too much to do
to keep up even simply deleting all of the wonderful messages posted
by all you great transporter fans.  I wish I had been able to read more
or even reply to more of the messages I did read, but I have too many
pans on the fire.  And now that I have &quot;discovered&quot; the WWW, 
as well as regained a desire to learn more about programming and
networking, I need to free up some time, so vanagon_at_lenti has to go.

I'll still be spending lots of time in cyberspace and hope to get
updates on significant list happenings from David Schwarze and Martha
Rubin.  I'll obviously check David's Web page often for tour updates,
and I hope to have my homepage up very soon, at least in a beta form
(aren't they all?).  It'll be at http://www.stanford_dot_edu/~poser
(I think).  At any rate, I will let David know when it is up so that
he can add me to his list of links (if he so desires).  I plan to have
at least one photo of my vehicle, so you can see what Ms. Pickle looks
like.

If my life gets more organized and/or less complicated, I will return
to the list.  I know you'll get by without me....

See y'alls in cyberspace,

-Patrick
