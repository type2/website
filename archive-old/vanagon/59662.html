Mike--

Regarding Consumer Reports, I don't believe that I've EVER read a
favorable review for ANY VW product.  Their reports are definately
biased towards Japanese vehicles.  As an example, I bought a new Dodge
Neon last fall.  If you read the Consumer Reports review, they are dogs
of cars.  If you read Car &amp; Driver, they're wonderful.  The reports were
nearly complete opposites of each other.

I know that there was a recent report (somebody help me here with
specifics please) that had the VW Vanagon tied with Mazda's MVP for the
highest in customer satisfaction after X years (I can't remember if it
was 5 or 8).  That says a lot.

The biggest downer about any VW vehicle, and the reason so many speak
ill of them, is the lack of qualified mechanics.  However, they are
designed so well, that they are very easy to work on with the proper
guidance (aka, the list!).  The engine compartment on my vanagon is
spaced out so well that I don't have a problem doing anything myself
(although the starter isn't exactly in a wonderful position!).  The
first time I raised the hood on the Neon, whoa, ain't no way I could do
ANYTHING on it.

Concerning power, yes it's a rather small engine to be lugging that big
beast around.  However, it really isn't that bad.  I find that I can
take off at redlights as quickly as anyone else.  And I just have to
give myself plenty of room when passing on a two lane road (rarely
happens though!).  I can go down the interstate at 70, no problem.

Another benefit is that it is EXTREMELY comfortable to drive for
extended periods.

What's there to say, while there are no guarantees and there are lemons
of EVERY type out there, you can't go too wrong with a vanagon.  I love
mine and wouldn't trade it for anything.

Good luck!
