Subject: Splittie with wrong size wheels

This morning was abnormally warm so I thought I tinker with my bus.  First on 
the agenda was checking my tyre pressure which seemed to be a bit uneven.  On 
inspection of the tyres, I realized that I have 15 inch wheels in the back and 
14 inchers in the front.  I bought my 59' back in October and feel a little 
embarrassed that I didn't realize it sooner. The ride quality is horrible really 
although I have never driven another bus to compare. At first I believed it to 
be my shocks which may be bad as well but now I realize that the wheels/tyres 
have to come first.  The front are 
195-75-14s and the back- 215-75-15s.  My 59' (477383) Panel
came with 15 inch wheels on ALL four corners right?  The previous owner gave me 
two extra wheels and tyres which I pulled out of storage today.  One is a 15&quot; 
and the other is a 14&quot;.  I need a spare so I am going to start to look for two 
15&quot; wheels.  I would like to keep the bus as stock as possible but would it be 
better to go with 14s instead?
What are the advantages if any?  Any reply would be greatly
appreciated.  Thanks to all in advance!
