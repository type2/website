&gt; replace the coolant temp sensor ... the blue one (sticks off to the left
&gt; side) on the thermostat. it tells the computer that the engine is cold
&gt; and therefore the idle should be upped. sounds like your sensor has died
&gt; and the computer thinks the engine is warm all the time. it's a $15 part.
&gt; oh, and be sure to get a new rubber o-ring with it. about another $1.
VW Dealer in Victoria: $41 + 4.65 - gee, last time I checked the US 
exchange rate was ~35%, not 350% !!!
Local FLAPS has them for $16 though... :)
 
&gt; you'll lose some coolant, but not much. it's easier to do from up top,
&gt; reaching down from inside the engine compartment (it's in the front left
&gt; corner, just &quot;outside&quot; the engine area) ... that way, you don't get any
&gt; coolant in your face/hair/etc. &lt;the voice of experience&gt;.
I may just wait until I flush the system anyway...

Thanks!
