&gt; I've seen a few postings in the archives referring to a fan coming on (or

&gt; 
&gt; How do I know if my fridge has one and/or if it is working?  Strictly by
&gt; sound?  Is it on all the time, or is there an audible cycling on &amp; off?
&gt; 
If it is working, you hear it.  It only comes on when things get hot
back there.  Here in Texas in the summer, it can come on even if the
refig is off.  You may not be able to hear it above engine noise.

&gt; Could this be the explanation for insuffiecient cooling (i.e. the ice
&gt; melted!).

Possibly..
&gt; 
&gt; Would the interior fans (for sale and Camping World or Radio Shack) take
&gt; the place of my (missing?) fan?

If you could get it back there!
Pull your unit out.  It's a tiny little thing, the motor isn't more than
1&quot; in diameter.
