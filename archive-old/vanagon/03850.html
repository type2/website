Well, speaking from experience.....(that only includes pre-1967 busses.)

Fat chance! Look in wrecking yards. (excuse me...auto recycling

centers.:)) and you should be able to find what you want...

and, heck, on the drive you may even find something neat in the 

bushes, if you look....:)

And, the price is cheaper...there's _lots_ of that era bus here (in WA.)

in the yards....and you just might have fun.

(sorry if this post sound snotty, but I'm still trying to find to the
`
owner of that fifty-something bus........)
