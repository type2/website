Subject:      NC Bus dinner/potluck next week!

 Howdy all, and greetings from the somewhat motivationally challenged here of
the North Carolina Triangle Area Busses. (That's the Research Triangle area, as
in Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill, etc)
Anyway, we have decided to meet this coming Thursday, October 9th, for a
potluck dinner and bus talk/comparing/showing off session.
We'll meet at my house, which already seems to attract busses, and handily has
a large parking lot across the street, Thursday evening around 7:00 or so.
If you want to bring something ready to eat, that's fine, or else we can cook
in the busses in the parking lot, for that official Shakedown Street feel, or
else we can use my kitchen if necessary. We'll all just pitch in for a lovely
smorgasboard of delicious food...
Also, if anyone has a little too much fun to drive home, you can camp out in
the lot.
I live in Raleigh, about 2 miles inside the Beltline off Hillsborough St.
Here are directions-
&gt;From the I-440 beltline, take the Hillsborough Street exit. Head in towards
downtown for about 2 miles or so. Look for IHOP (International House of
Pancakes) on the right, which will be the corner of Hillsboro and Park Ave.
Turn Right onto Park Avenue, go up, and you'll see all the busses in front of
my house. (2 '67s live there, along with a few latemodels belonging to various
SO's and friends). Park in the YMCA parking lot across from my house...
Anyway, I hope to see lots of the various listvolk there...
Join us!
E-mail me if you have any questions...
