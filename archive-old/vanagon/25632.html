Well, personally, I think the Vanagon drives comfortably.  But they also 
seem to have less power due to more weight.  If you want power, and 
air-cooled, I'd say go for a late bay window bus.  The bay window buses 
are almost as quiet as the Vanagons, and the late ones have worms and 
roller steering, which is supposed to be better.
