&gt; Hey, maybe we can get someone(s) to sponser us.  Maybe even VW.  But would
&gt; they want to?  Well, I presumed the trip was for all Type II's and not just
&gt; 'bricks'.  If so, then maybe VW would.  Whadaya think?

The trip is of course open to all type II's.  Shoot, I really don't care *what*
people bring, but non-typeII's will likely be subject to large amounts of
teasing by those of us that are &quot;more suitably endowed&quot;  :)
