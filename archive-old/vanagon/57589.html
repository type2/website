&gt; Pardon my ignorance, but I thought &quot;Eurobago&quot; was a kind of cool generic
&gt; slang for VW camper.  I was ready to start using it.  You mean there is a
&gt; vw/winnebago?  What an odd combination.  Does anyone have any pics?

 Yes, strange as it may sound, VW teamed up with Winnebago to create the
most expensive camper-van yet! The one that I am familiar with is called
the Rialta. It looks like a Winnebago that someone grafted onto the cab
of an EV. From what I've recently learned (this string of posts) it does
have a well disguised but roomy pop-top. That's about where the
similarities to a Westy end, the rest is *pure* luxury. Spacious,
ergonomical, and well equipped with amenities rarely seen travelling
behind a VW hood ornament such as a really neat fold out shower stall! 

 There is also a EuroVan Westy, but that's different (and cheaper).
