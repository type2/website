This is a follow up note to the proposed gathering of folks in the DC area this past 
Sunday.

The meet was (proposed) supposed to happen at the Zoo Bar across from the National 
Zoo in the District.

When I arrived, I saw another Vanagon 'Westy' on the street nearby (I was hoping).

Upon entering the bar, I noted approximately a half-dozen people present. I asked if 
anyone owned the van outside, no response

I waited about an hour and concluded the meeting had a total of one person in 
attendance. Comprising a quorum, I adjourned the meeting and departed.

	No old business, no new business no future meetings planned.

If someone else wants to pick up the planning and active effort, I'll be supportive.
