&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Joel querries as to what what a Kombi is...
&gt; 
&gt; I believe that Kombi is short for Kombination...at least in the
&gt; early busses, Kombi's were one step higher in the model range
&gt; than the plain, window-less delivery van. They had three windows
&gt; on either side of the passenger compartment, usually cloth seats
&gt; and trim.
&gt; 
&gt; The idea for the kombi was that you could use it as a delivery vad
&gt; oops van during the week and use it as a family car on weekends.

Hello,
	My manual for my old 72 westy showed the kombi as the step between
the 7pass and the westy.  It showed a van that had a rear seat that folded
into a bed but, looked more like the regular seats than the westy rear
seat.  I always thought that it was a kombination of 7pass and camper.
