Subject: Re: Stupid decisions was FS: 79 Westfalia

I ran into someone in the elevator the other day that I knew I had met some
where. While quickly rooting through the possible options I mentioned
&quot;Volkswagens.&quot; &quot;Are you into Volkswagens?&quot; the obviously German accented and
German named gentleman asked. Sure, I occasionally buy them. &quot;I have driven
a few,&quot; I said. He asked why anyone would STILL be interested in those road
hazards. He mentioned that he had a rough time getting anyone to take his
old van when he needed to sell it a few years ago. It was an early 23 deluxe
sunroof! He said he had to basically pay the person to take it away. &quot;It was
SOOOOO SLOOW! The engine was horribly small!&quot; he whined. I gave him my card
and told him to definitely keep me in mind. If he or anyone else knows wants
to have one towed away or is wanting to sell any VW please call. I would be
happy to help I said. The elevator door opened and we went on our way...
Always willing to help I thought =)

&gt;There is a westfalia for sale around the corner, asking price, &quot;firm&quot; 
&gt;$2500.  It has a rebuild with 100 miles on it.  It has formica wood 
&gt;grain cabinetry, and lime/olive green plaid upholstery.  The body is 
&gt;straight.  It has rust underneath almost every window.  I didn't 
&gt;check wheel wells or rocker panels.  While my search 
&gt;for the &quot;perfect&quot; camper doesn't include the westfalia set up, I'm 
&gt;wondering what this kind of rust, and the amount of it, should do to the 
&gt;price, assuming everything else in the drive train, electrics, body, and 
&gt;suspension is in decent working order.  
&gt;
&gt;(I sold my 66 camper in 1983 for $75.  Blown engine, spring seats, broken 
&gt;frame on bed.  Of all decisions I've ever made, that one ranks pretty close 
&gt;to &quot;stupid&quot;)
