Subject: Cannot remove steering arm!  Help!

I'm trying to remove the steering box on my 1973 type 2
so that I can do some welding on the chassis, but I'm 
having great difficuly removing the steering arm from the
splined steering shaft.  I have used a puller on it as 
suggested in the Haynes manual, but it hasn't budged.
I've given it the shock treatment, but not too hard for fear 
of damaging the box and am now moving on to the heat 
treatment.  I am, however, worried about damaging the seals
on the box.

Can anybody offer any suggestions or if they have heated up 
the steering arm before tell me how the seals faired?

Thanks.  Nick Durie, Brighton, UK.
