Subject: '67 camper

I recently stumbled across a '67 camper/bus in a guy's driveway and have
been thinking for a while that I want one. So I go to the door and ask and
sure enough he wants to sell it!! Well I'm sort of new to air cooled VWs and
especially busses. I'd like to get some unofficial advice as to whether this
is a good deal or not.

The bus is very clean, not totally chery, but a nearly original that has
been gone over with a &quot;fine tooth comb&quot;. There is very little rust, if any,
and everything works electrically. All the camping stuff is there and works.
It even has the kid's hammock that came with it originally. All the rubber
is replaced with the German stuff and it has new Yokahama radials. The paint
is new Imron (coffee and cream).

Mechanically, it seems perfect. It has a &quot;new&quot;, rebuilt engine, by the
current owner 18??, dual carb engine that will cruise all day at 70 mph. He
is asking $5000.00. 

Does it sound like an ok deal, a good deal or a great deal? If I don't buy
it now, what would my chance be of finding another one in a year from now?

Thanks for any input. And to avoid cluttering the list, please feel free to
reply personally to me (that might actually be preferable).
