Subject: Re: Something positive

here is a possitive note.  before i restored my dads bus, (a 1960 single cab)
he used to drive it daily to and from work.  he went darn near 10 years 
without any major problems.  just routine maintainance and it ran great.
my crew cab gave me little trouble the 2 years i drove it before i 
started restoring it.  it is a 1960 crew cab.

i am sure that there are many other older bus's out there that are a 
pleasure to own and drive too.

take care and God BLess
