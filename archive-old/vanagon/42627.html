Subject: Reducing Internal Noise

Are you installing a new stereo in your car. I've always wondered how not
to spend a ton of money on this stuff. Here from the rec.audio_dot_car FAQ is
an alternative to Dynamat.

http://www.NSMA.Arizona.EDU/~ianbjor/rac.faq/

Are there any alternatives for Dynamat? It's too expensive!

In this question, &quot;Dynamat&quot; refers to all commercial products that are
marketed expressly for reducing ambient noise in the car. Dynamat, Stinger
RoadKill, et al. all have similar pricing, so this question is intended to
give non-standard options.

There is a material known as &quot;Ice Guard,&quot; which is used by roofing
contractors. It is similar to Dynamat, both in thickness and density. It is
self-adhesive on one side, and seems to work very well.

Unfortunately, it is sold only in large quantities (225 ft^2 rolls), and
runs about $70 for this much. Perhaps a few people could get together for a
roll, or it might be possible to get scraps from a roofing contractor.

cheers,

Bren

results: Drag behind car through puddles, blow-dry on roofrack.
