For the past few weeks I have been getting little electric shocks when
touching the metal bodywork of the car when climbing out.

It only happens from time to time. I initially dismissed it because it
coincided with wearing a woolen jumper. But it has happened a bit even now
when its warmer.

1984 Caravelle GL, 7/10 seater, 187k miles
