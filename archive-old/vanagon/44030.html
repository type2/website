Subject: Help! Engine Dies While Crusing

Hello All!
I'm back again. I had a really crummy winter, including loss of
internet access, but now I have web access again :-). Anyway, we
fired up the Good Old Van, our '81 Vanagon Westy, for it's 2nd
trip of the year this weekend for a fishing trip. (And I showed
all the guys how to fish, too.) She was fine for most of the 
weekend, which included alot of driving. Saturday evening, after
a hour of highway driving, we stopped to get more bait. When we
returned to the van, she had a very hard time starting. She would
start and then stall out. Wel after finally starting it up, we
pulled out on the highway, and the engine just died. Not stalled
out. Nope it just stopped, like someone pulled the plug. This 
happened at least six times during the ten minute trip to our
camping spot. So before staring on the trip home Sunday, we
reseated all the electrical connections to the engine. The van
started up after some coaxing, and died once on route to home.
My hubby and I both think we have some kind of electrical problem.
But where? We put a new engine in last summer, it has probaly less
than 3,000 miles on it. It has a new alternator this year. Anyone
have any suggestions on what it can be? Any help would be much
appreciated. Thanks!

Lisa
