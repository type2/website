&gt;JC WhipMe advertises these struts for the back hatch of a Vanagon, for
&gt;$20 each plus shipping. About the lowest price I've seen. Anyone tried
&gt;these?


To amplify (sorry about the double post, friends):

In JC Whitney catalog #582C, page 22, bottom right corner, it lists:


APPLICATION                PART NO.     PRICE ea.

80-83 Vanagon (liftgate)   12NG0858X    $19.99
84-93 Vanagon (liftgate)   12NG0859N    $19.99

Shipping for two is $8 to $11 depending on where you are.
Witney's number is 312-431-6102.

If I were affiliated with Whitney, I wouldn't be living in San Diego, now 
would I?
