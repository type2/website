Bill,

What can I expect, in cost.&lt;  

That depends if you're going to do it or hire a mechanic. A reputable 
vw mechanic here in Cincinnati, OH quoted me $1000. I shreiked, kneeled 
to the list and archives, bought a kit for under $200, borrowed some 
tools and stands and started yesterday! There are some great procedures 
in the archive and I can't stress enough the generousity of the list 
members (thanks joel, tim, john, ranier, etc.). Joel sent me some great 
info that has proved thus far invaluable. As far as a complete rebuild, 
can't help you, yet anyway:)
