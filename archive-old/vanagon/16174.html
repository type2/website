Subject: stripping the undercarriage
Date: Sun, 23 Apr 1995 10:23:18 -0500 (CDT)

So I got myself a quart of POR-15 and decided to spend Saturday prepping
the undercarriage  by removing dirt, loose rust, and the old, crackled,
layer of tar-based undercoating.

Well, with a plastic scraper, a screwdriver, and a wire-brush, it took me
3 hours to clean up, oh say... 10% of the area. :( At that rate,I would
have to spend *every* Saturday for the next 2 months, just to strip all
that stuff. 

Would anyone know of a better method? Heat? Acid? Sand blasting?
Vibrating and Shaking? Ultrasound? Driving through the Sahara? Let someone
else do it?

I'll be glued to the monitor, waiting for an answer. Thanks in advance!!
