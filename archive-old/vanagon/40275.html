Thanks to all participants of the French Creek State Park trip to eastern 
PA this weekend. A great time was had by all!

Special thanks to Paul &quot;Mandela&quot; Weiss, who was hassled by The Man for 
having the poor taste to invite us &quot;troublemakers&quot; to his campfire. 
Thanks for taking the rap! We were all ready to break you out of prison 
if need be.

A trip report is imminent from the listmember who volunteered (actually, 
he was shanghaied) to write it.

Thanks again folks. May the road rise to meet you...

--Dave
