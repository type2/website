Subject: * HELP: '86 SYNCRO PROBLEMS.. HOW BAD? *

Hi,

I recently posted a message regarding a 1986 Vanagon GL Syncro that I am
considering buying for $4000.00 in Portland, Oregon with 143,000 miles on
it..

* I found out that this VW came from a dealership (traded) as well.. Any
  slip-shod dealer tricks to be aware of?

I have gotten a chance to take a better look at it and found the following
problems and would like to know how major they MIGHT be..

- Seal at the junction of the transmission and the driveshaft is leaking (gear
  oil?) This leak is located at the support cross-member where the U-joint
meets
  the transmission.. The fluid is golden-yellow colored.. Does this warrant the
  replacement of any parts ($$$) other than the seal?

- I test drove the Syncro and at one point navigated a steep driveway, the Oil
  Buzzer/Light came on about 10 - 15 seconds later and we had to shut the
  ignition off to get it to stop..

- The Oil Buzzer/Light came on 2 times subsequently, at which time we pulled
  over and found that the oil level was down about 1/4.. No leaks were
  noticeable..

- The front tires had been rotated to the rear.. The &quot;previously front&quot; tires
  had lots of wear on the outer-most edge (both tires)


Thanks again.. =)


                                                        Chris..
