&gt; just an entry instead of an ad.  Another place for references is the heavy
&gt; equipment/truck parts dealers.  We did that for getting custom made a/c lines.

Oh, I forgot to mention as well, in the Appalachian areas at least,
mine (coal) supply stores are great places to get hydraulic fittings
and lines.  Our local shop sells Aeroquip fittings for far less than
the prices advertised by some people in the mags and are quite
reasonable when it comes to labor prices for making up A/C or oil
lines.
