Subject: Vanagon grill panels
Date: Thu, 7 Apr 94 10:07:51 EDT



The front grill on my '84 Vanagon has two pressed board panels attached to
the back side, one on either side of the radiator.  One of those panels has
fallen off and the other is a rapid state of deterioration.  Are those panels
just for show or do they perform some sort of complex air flow dynamics that
escapes my comprehension?  I would like to remove them both if they are not
necessary.  If they are needed, does anyone have any experience with replacing
them?
