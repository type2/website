Subject:      Re: Synthetic Oil(s)

Why did you choose a 5-50? My local VW shop recommended either 5-30 or
10-30 (Mobil 1). My driving conditions are mostly highway. Weather temps
vary between low 40's up to high 90's depending on the season. My '90 Westy
has just under 7k miles.

Any recommendations?

TIA

Chris

&gt;Chris, I have been using Synthoil brand synthetic oil in my 90 Carat for
&gt;about 115k miles (145k total) and have had no problems to date. Now I'm
&gt;going to switch to Castrol Syntec 5-50 wt because Synthoil is $10 a quart
&gt;and has to mail ordered. The cost is actually not much higher than
&gt;regular oil because you only change oil every 50k miles, change filter
&gt;every 3 to 5 thousand miles and top off. So it works out to about $15
&gt;every 5 thousand miles. Castrol had some info on synthetic oil _at_
&gt;www_dot_castrol_dot_com
