Okay,
	(refresher - problems with the brakes in my '56 bus)

	Got the new lines on, bled and all.

	Something wierd though:  The brakes pull sometimes, but not others,
and they seem kinda hard sometimes, but not all the time.

	I know that the hardness is attributable to glazing, and cosnidering
that this beast sat for a little over 20 years, thats imaginable (as
was the squirrels nest on top of the gas tank...)

	What would cause the erratic braking behavior?

	I finaly drove it some tonight, using it to move stuff to my new 
place, and it seems that the tranny shifts fine intal all four gears,
but howls like you wouldn't believe.  And it pops out of reverse.
Anybody have any experience rebuilding a split-case tranny?  Or, what
has to be modified to put in a fully synchronized one in.  I am told
that it is soemthing to do with the front mount, and I can see that the 
nosecone is way different than the later (synchro) tranny.  I do not
want to discard the reduction boxes.
