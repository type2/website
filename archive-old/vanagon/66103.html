&gt;Should I do this? Who should I turn to for this work?

Steve, the big question is do you have seat rails for a middle seat in the
floor of your bus?  Many do.  Your seat options are as follows:

1. Folding, theatre style seat from one of the upscale models (Carat &amp;
Wolfsburg).  This would mount behind the front passenger seat.

2. Middle row single captains chair.  This was a factory option.

3. Two seater bench from a 7 passenger bus.

Options 2 &amp; 3 require middle seat rails.

Options 1 &amp; 2 are much harder to find and are more expensive.

I think you will be pleased with any of the options.  We got a two seater
bench (option 3) and love it.  It installs and uninstalls in less than 5
minutes.  We have even used it camping.  At destination we have it just
outside the door under the awning.  It is the most popular chair at any
campground.

Don't sell the bus.
