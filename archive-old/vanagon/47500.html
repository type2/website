&gt;I have seen an '84 Wolfsburg Edition GL Vanagon with the corduroy pleated
&gt;interior, rear sofa bed with storage compartment underneath made by
Westfalia,
&gt;tachometer and dig.clock, fixed middle seat, snap on curtain set, and &quot;jail
&gt;bars&quot; in the rear hatch window. Did they continue this model into 1985, and
was
&gt;the '84 Wolfsburg Edition the only Vanagon that came factory with &quot;jail
bars&quot; in
&gt;the rear hatch window??

Good questions.  I don't have much expertise on the pre '86 vans yet.

&gt;Also have seen an '85 and an '86 Wolfsburg Edition camper with pop
&gt;top,corduroy velour pleated interior, jump seat behind driver with storage
compartment
&gt;underneath,fold out table from left wall, sofabed, and cabinets overhead and
in
&gt;left rear,with no stove,or no removeable sink fridge combo behind the front
&gt;passenger or ever any indication that there was ever one there. Was this a 2
&gt;year only model??

I've seen the '86 Wolfsburg Camper and have not yet been able to determine
what distingishes it from the standard non-GL Camper.  Neither had stove/sink
stuff - only the removeable 12VDC/120VAC refer behind the front passenger
seat.  I speculate that the '86 Wolfsburgs had a unique paint color and
included some features as standard equipment that were options in the
standard Campers.  Don't know about the '85 models.

Ronald, could you please Email me as complete a description of your '84
Wolfsburg as you care to write.  It will be useful information for when I get
around to writing the &quot;Model Summary&quot; for 1984.   Thanks.
