Greetings!
	This letter was originally written by Martha, with comments and
#'s 9 and 10 thrown in by yours truly.


OK fellow travellers, I am at the point of needing more input from all of you 
about our proposed &quot;Bricks Across America&quot; tour.  Please take a moment when you 
have the chance and let me know your feelings (brief is OK) on the following.  
You're welcome do do this with your editor, or simply to write essay style - 
whatever is easiest for you.  [Since I know there are close to 30 of you that
are interested, please send this to me (schwarze_at_nosc_dot_mil) and martha
(nrubin_at_s1.csuhayward_dot_edu) so as not to overwhelm the list. -d]

Secondly, thanks to the many of you who have volunteered your time an effort 
to help coordinate this thing.  Fear not, if this thing materializes, you will 
be called upon!!!

There seems to be a general trend in favoring summer 1995 for this trip 
(probably  8 weeks, Mid-May through mid-July), making a wide circle around the 
country, perhaps up into Canada, with people joining and leaving as they wish, 
for as long as they like.  Given that scenario, I'd like to know the following:

1.  Do you prefer camping?  Hotels?  Locations that offer both options close 
by?  I guess what I'm saying, is how many of you will be camping out in your 
buses/vans?  Do we want everyone to make their OWN reservations, or try to do 
something as a group?  How about group camps?  [I was originally under the
impression that this would be a &quot;camping&quot; trip, but I appreciate a daily
shower as much as the next guy/gal.  -d]

2.  Do we want to do some sort of once-per-week potluck, or at some other 
interval, or is this just too complicated, and should everyone simply fend for 
themselves foodwise?

3.  How &quot;structured&quot; do we want this?  Something like stopping at a major 
points of interest every other day with &quot;catch-up&quot; rendezvous locations for 
those who want to sightsee longer?  More often?  Less often?  Do we want to 
plan deliberate group activities, and if so, of what magnitude and what type?  
Do we want to have planned sightseeing activities for the group, or should 
everyone just be on their own.  Or, should we plan as we go (for things that 
don't have to be decided in advanced, like reservations, etc.) [Some have
suggested stops at junkyards, wineries/breweries, amusement parks, etc..
Comments?  -d]

4.  Mid-trip 'net access seems to be a big concern.  Does anyone have a laptop 
they would be willing to bring along?  Also, it will be crucial for us to stay 
in contact with list members joining us mid-trip, etc.  Also, what about 
communication within the caravan during the trip?  Car phones?  CB radios?  A 
contact person?  Phone tree?

5.  Is 8 weeks enough time for this trip?  Too long?  

6.  Just how wide of a circle do we want to make?  Many have suggested 
centering the rendevous points around points of interest such as National Parks 
and the like - Yellowstone, Yosemite, Grand Canyon, Zion, Bryce, Crater Lake, 
etc.  If this is reasonable, I need input from all of you on points of interest 
to lay out on our map.  This should probably be for the US as well as Canada.  

7.  Just how many of you are interested in doing the ENTIRE trip of proposed 
long length like this?

8.  Do you think this caravan is something that VW might be interested in from 
a PR standpoint, or, for that matter, the VW magazines or other media?  Do we 
want them to be involved?  I realize it's a little akin to a VW show, but on a 
much greater scale, and somewhat unusual, and as such, might be an interesting 
publicity item for VW, particularly as it would last for so long and take place 
in so many different locations.

9.  Some people have expressed interest in sharing expenses, either by
providing a ride for someone else or by riding along with someone else.
I know some of you don't have campers.  If all people interested in this
will indicate it, I will try to put those people in contact with each other.
Also, are any of you planning on bringing kids?  How about pets?

10.  What parts and tools, if any, would you have available to bring along?

As soon as I've heard from a significant number of you (that is, let everyone 
have a chance to check their e-mail and respond), I'll post the general 
consensus to the list, probably within a week or so....

Martha &amp; David
