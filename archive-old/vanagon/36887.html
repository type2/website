&gt; Also, how difficult (time and tools) is it to replace a boot on the cv
&gt;joint?  Mine is cracked.

I recently replaced the grease in two joints on one axle beacuse the outer
joint was clicking.  Removing, regreasing, and installing the axle took about
2 hours.  This is lying on my back in the driveway - a shop with a pit or a
lift would be MUCH quicker.  I'd add about 1 hour to my time to remove one
joint, replace 1 boot, and re-install the joint.  You'll need an allen head
&quot;socket&quot; for a 1/2&quot; ratchet (I used a 3/8&quot; drive allen with a 3/8&quot; to 1/2&quot;
drive adapter) &amp; 6&quot; extension to remove/replace the axle.  I THINK you'll
need a vice, a hammer, and a c-clip tool to remove/install the CV joint
from/to the axle.

Good luck,
