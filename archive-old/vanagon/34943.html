&gt;Sorry to be the bearer of bad news.

Well, considering the low price the seller was asking, this is more
bad news for the seller who is taking a loss, than for the buyer who
now saves some extra $$ for the rebuild/replacement/whatever.

Hmmm, let's see... Mostly sound body, trans, radiator &amp; heater already
in place, engine dead and maybe can't even be used for rebuilding, so
a whole new/used block must be brought in... and this in a car which is
even slower and more leisurely than the &quot;normal&quot; VW bus tradition...

This sounds to me like an excellent opportunity for an engine transplant!
Porsche, maybe? Corvair? Not this time, already has radiator, hoses, heater,
maybe a gauge etc. What's this I see over here? Why... it's... AN AMERICAN
V6 engine!

Damn, now why didn't I think of that?
