Assuming you can find an assistant for such duty, that's certainly the
easiest solution.  One of my first VWs had a long nail welded onto the
head of that particular bolt, which very conveniently kept it from
going anywhere without you wanting it to.  You have to bend the nail
around a bit until it hangs the bolt up in the right place, and you
have to be careful that it doesn't get too close to power-bearing
wires, but that's not that difficult a set of requirements to meet.

Since that particular vehicle and I parted ways quite some time ago,
ever since I've just made sure that the half-moon shape of the head is
oriented correctly.  Then, as long as you move slowly and deliberately
(and the threads are clean on both the nut and the bolt!), there's
usually not a problem getting onto it either.

The one I always end up grumbling over is the top left one.  There's
not a convenient starter to wedge it against, and I usually end up
crawling underneath a couple of times to push it back.  Again, slow
and deliberate is the real key here.  I keep thinking about putting a
touch of high temperature adhesive on there -- just enough to
discourage it from moving, but not so much that I'll never be able to
get it out if I need to.
