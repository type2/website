Subject:       Wasserboxer Heads..

Hi everyone.  With all the recent talk about these heads leaking, 
etc, does anybody know if this was for all years?  A friend of mine 
who had this happen to him on his '88 was told that after a 
production date of October, 1988 the problem was fixed.  Is this 
true?  Or is ANY watercooled Vanagon a possible target right through 
to 1991 models?

If any year Wasserboxer is a potential target for this massive 
expense, should VW not OFFICIALLY recall these vehicles as there is 
an obvious design fault here.  Just getting the heads and/or headgaskets 
replaced is not going to stop this from happening again.

Ideas from anyone?  There must be substantial evidence to this as 
proven by Gerry's List.

Harry.
