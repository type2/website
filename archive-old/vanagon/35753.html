In a message dated 96-02-20 10:48:12 EST, you write:

&gt;Just got a good price on 195's and had just about decided to go with them
&gt;$265 installed, Michelin XCH4 6 ply  (c rated)
&gt;
&gt;You think 205's?
&gt;
&gt;Are you in the DC area?
&gt;
&gt;As to the door:
&gt;The dealer did the recall some time ago.  Could the problem resurface?  
&gt;
&gt;Someone told me to spray a can of WD 40 in there.  Will do very soon, and
let
&gt;you know.

&gt;BTW,
&gt;That recall info post was probably a little long for some people.

Peter,

You posted to the list.  I assume you were responding to my post.

If you found a good set of 195s for a good price, go for it.  I would choose
the 205s only if I had a second chance.  Keep in mind the difference is only
10mm in width.  I really wouldn't condsider paying more for 205s than I would
195s.  The difference is almost nil.  Its just the theory of more is better.
 To do over again, I would go with the 205s, but I wouldn't pay more and
wouldn't sacrifice quality or brand for the extra 10mm.

I live in Springfield, VA. How about you?  If you live in the area, I would
recommend NTW on Newington road just off of I-95.  They have mechanics (well,
tire changers anyway) that stick around and know their product.  The service
managers are fair and resonable.  If you give them a price comparison on a
tire they will beat it.  Then ask them for a 5% good customer discount.  I
have never been more satisfied with a local automotive place in the DC metro
area than I have with the folks at NTW.  Other NTW stores are catch as catch
can.  Some better than others.

Sorry about the long post on recalls.  I tried to load the recall list as an
attached text file.  I guess it didn't work.
