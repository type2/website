&gt;Replacing the head is the normal way, used heads are available, try Parts
&gt;Place Auburn Hills Michigan.
&gt;Don't know why the corrosion pits can't be filled with TIG welding, then
&gt;milled. Perhaps take it to a GOOD machine shop, non-automotive alloy
&gt;fabricator types who do lots of aluminium work.

A local independent VW repair shop says that this is their usual repair.
 They say it is sucsessful and don't see the advantage of replacing a whole
head for a few little pits.  BTW, how do those used heads that are available
become good again without the same welding/machining procedure?

&gt;&gt;BTW, in my opinion, the Bently manual really sucks!  Even simple tasks such
&gt;&gt;as draining the coolant are described in such a manner as to make them
&gt;&gt;completely uninteligible.

&gt;Oh, and you'll get used to the Bentley, like you have a choice :)  Tim

I'll second both of those comments!!!!!   The &quot;list&quot; ought to consider
writing a Vanagon maintenance manual.  I'll post a message at a later date on
this subject.
