Thank you one and all for your replies to my inquiry about this conversion
company. they are now located in San Jose and still doing conversions of EV's
and much more.
I got off the phone with Salim there .... he offered to walk me through some
wiring problems and give me some assistance with the interior. Very nice and
helpful. I'm glad I was able to get in touch with him.
Thanks again,
Chris
