&gt; Lambada?.........Isn't that a dance step or something?  Is the &quot;fuel
&gt; injection lambada&quot; some variation on the basic lambada dance?
&gt; 

Yes, It's the dance that the exhaust does as it leaves the manifold
and enters the pipes...
However, I think that Harmon actually meant La Bamba...
The Richie Valens song.
You can, of course, try to Lambada in your bus listening to 
La Bamba... If you're in California, you might even want to do
it in La Breah (or however those Tar Pits are spelled).
Or, if in Africa, maybe do it near the Limpopo?

Uh oh! I'm stretching it now! 
Happy Friday Folks.
