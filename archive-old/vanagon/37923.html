David Easterwood was talking about a kid that bought an unassembled 21
window from a friend for big money.  

Ellis replys:
A buddy of mine in Phoenix bought a real clean, original  '65 dbl cab in
August from an old man for $1450.  Put a rebuilt 40 hp.  Sold it for $4,250
a couple of months later.  He said the buyer came back and told him that
while driving it a guy in a Porsche chased him down and bought it nearly on
the spot (allowing usual title transfer procedures etc.)  for $6,000.
DOH!
