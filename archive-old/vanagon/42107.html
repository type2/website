Subject: Bentley manual for '63-'67 busses

&gt;Howdy all, as we are hitting the road this summer, I figured it's about time I
&gt;caved in and spent the bucks for the Bentley manual for '63-'67 busses. I know
&gt;it's going to be expensive, but I was just wondering if anyone had a cheap
&gt;source for them, or knew of the best place to get them. I called the Bentley
&gt;publishers, BTW, and they quoted a pretty darn high price as well...
&gt;Sigh...

I just picked up an original shop manual ( I assume this is what the
Bentley series is based on). I found this along with a 1959-61 shop manual.
I can't offer to sell it as it is in danish, but if you're stuck for wiring
schematics or whatever I'll scan the appropriate pages, until you locate an
affordable copy of your own. By he way, this manual is in two volumes with
great sections on how to install all the ambulance accessories, putting is
the sun roof in a deluxe and what not. My plain old 221 is envious.
