The pans are additional reinforcement and are found on sun-roof and 
double-door (both sides) models.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I was going over a guy's '67 Deluxe (a future list member??) and he had belly
&gt; pans on it.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know if these belly pans have any structural purpose or are
&gt; they just to keep the floor healthy?
&gt; 
&gt; I was thinking of putting a Deluxe roof on my bus and was wondering if Deluxe
&gt; buses had any additional reinforcement.  With the roof open and the doors
&gt; open I had to wonder what the hell was keeping the front end attached to the
&gt; rear end?!?!?
&gt; 
&gt; What is the history behind these belly pans?  Did they only come on certain
&gt; models?  Where they always around?  Is it worth fabricating some for my bus?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for any info,
&gt; ..Markus
