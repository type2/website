Subject: 71 start no start



&gt;I still can't figure out why when the starter is engaged the juice to the
&gt;coil goes out...only to return the moment I release the key and the starter 
&gt;stops. Is this the norm? I don't think so.
&gt;
&gt;I need help...Martin

Seems like years ago  I ran into the same trouble with my friends 66 
 Chevy pickup, it turned out to be an external resistor (barristor) on 
 the wire going to the coil.  Back track and check the voltage all the 
 way to the battery if you have to, it will take less time and be much 
 better than rerouting the voltage. If you need diagrams I can copy out 
 what I have and mail/fax them to you.
