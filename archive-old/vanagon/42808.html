Subject: Re: Packing Questions still  8-]

Packing methodologies as presented are a similar deal with us but you forgot
to mention that the key is to pack RIGHT when you should be meeting someone
else (or a caravan of sixty) who is/are the only person/people who knows the
way to the &quot;secret&quot; location. 
Last week while discussing a planned trip in late June, I mistakenly
mentioned that Mrs. VanBondo and I should &quot;plan ahead&quot; and be packed the day
before an upcoming trip and she went totally pillow throwing
&quot;Postal-Rosanne&quot; on me. We're talking ballistic! WHEW~! What ever you do
don't ever mention the words *planning ahead* or anything common sense.  Her
side of the thing is that I am always doing stupid stuff like making sure
the bus won't break down half way to the destination and illogical things
like that until the last minute. Ah, yeah, *planning ahead* goes both ways.
