Subject: Advice on Tires for Syncro?


Hi...
It is time to get new shoes for out '87 syncro camper.
After trying to get the Michelin MXL reinfornced for 6 weeks
I am ready to give up and try something else. Trouble is that
doesn't seem to be much stuff out there in the reinforced 205/70
size. My options seem to be going for 195/75,
215/70 or LT 27-8.5-14. My mechanic recommends the 215/70 size
and says that the LT would be too noisy. Personally, I am not
too thrilled about the 215's since they will throw the speedo out
of whack (larger diameter).. (also, would they fit the in
the spare weel compartment?)

Any suggestions or comments? What are you fellow vanagon/syncronauts
running?

TIA for any suggestions/success/horror stories.
