&gt;	Or better yet, JUMBO the ~25ft ClassC minimotorhome that sleeps 
&gt;	six, has a built-in shower AND toilet AND hot-water heat, along 
&gt;	with a 15cuft LP/12v/115v refrigerator/freezer, 4 burner stove 
&gt;	and oven, dual A/C, forced air heat, 40 gallon fresh water tank, 
&gt;	separate black and gray water holding tanks, and 4KW generator... 
&gt;	Plenty of storage space for a family of 6 and it's paraphernalia
&gt;	for extended road adventures.
&gt;
&gt;	460cu.inch V8 with appetite to match (~7mpg) :-(
&gt;

	&quot;Oh Lord, protect us from the devil, the plague, the
	vikings, and Ari's monster motorhome&quot;
