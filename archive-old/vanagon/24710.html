Subject: RE:  animals in volkswagens

Althought nobody actually calls me a dog (I hope!), my bright blue '76 
bus is recognized as, &quot;the one with the dog hanging its head out the 
window.&quot;  I almost always have my dog with me when I go out, and I think 
some people believe she is the rightful owner of the bus...
