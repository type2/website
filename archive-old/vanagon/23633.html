Subject: Figured out what was wrong


Hi All,

Think we have figured out what went wron with the new 
engine. Doesn't look like it was a hydraulic valve lifter 
after all. What we heard was the sound of the torque 
converter plate self destructing. Have one on order from 
Wilson's junk in Oklahoma.

Will tell ya what happens when we get the new one on. Hope 
this is it.

Lisa
