&gt; 
&gt; I changed the tranny fluid yesterday, and although the book said 7.4 pts, I 
&gt; put in less than 6 pts.  I drained out even less.  Does anyone have similar 
&gt; experiences or know for sure the real amount required?  I had it warmed up, 
&gt; and let it drain for a couple of hours.
&gt; 
   I have never got the amount out of a tranny specified in the manuals
this includes in at least three front wheel drive VW's, my old Quantum
Synchro, our '86 Vanagon, and my recently ex '76 Bus which I just
changed, all had been full up to the fill plug before draining, all
were warmed up by running at 50 mph for at least 30 minutes then
immediately drained,  the bus I let drain for about 3 hours and was
still 1.0 pt low, the Quantum was way way low, maybe 2.5 pints.
