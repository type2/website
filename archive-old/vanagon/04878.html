Subject: Re: Five Year Dream Car Pick


Excuse me before we do this little contest, I believe the intent of
the original survey was a NEW car, not a used car...

If you are going to use those 5 categories, shouldn't you make
it clear whether or not you're talking new or used?

Hell, if the car is to be a used car, then there are an awful
lot of cars that we could look at...

If its used, and money was no object, then I could see some
possibilities like a Jaguar Mk V...or a Porsche 4 cam
Speedster, a Willys Jeepster, a Mercedes 540k,

so lets get ALL the rules straight.
