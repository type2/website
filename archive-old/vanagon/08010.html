Subject: Re[2]: Denton - the home of happiness. 


Denton, TX is the home of the University of North Texas and 
Texas Woman's University.  We have a mayor who won the 
Publishers Clearinghouse multimillion dollar prize.  Home of 
Brave Combo (the supercharged polka/ska/samba band famous in 
Dallas and Japan but unknown in between)  And we are the 
home of several VW Buses (4 on my street alone).

&gt; 
&gt; Ummm - is that the same Denton as featured in the Rocky Horror 
&gt; Picture Show?
&gt; :)
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone else want a Transporter T4 brochure now that I have 
&gt; 4 left?
&gt; (First 4 takers only, no Steves, Rics or Bushrats)  ;-&gt;

SURE
any kind of VW literature, even if it IS water cooled- let me know. 
By the way, Denton NC has the annual hit &quot;Southeast old threshers 
reunion&quot;, for old steam combines, tractors, farm equipment, etc...

BTW, Dale Earnhart lives 2 miles from my roommate, he's met him several 
times. We live in the heart of NASCAR country.
