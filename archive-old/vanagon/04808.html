Check the centre of the head temp gauge. For all intents and purposes
this is normal, 25-50 degrees above this would be out of range and a
reason to slow down below or to 50 mph. You will probably find that the
middle of the gauge is marked 350 F as it is on most. Driving into the
wind will probably raise the temp about 10-15 degrees. Idling, the engine
should drop to 250-300. If you are not getting these ranges, check that
the thermostat, duct work and oil level are right.

As for the transmission plug, virtually every FLAPS carries a VW
transmission drain plug socket that will fit your wrench. Others have
fashioned them out of bolts. Unless you are leaking transmission fluid, it
is unlikely there is a problem at that end. DC
