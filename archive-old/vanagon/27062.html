&gt;   Brad,

&gt;     I agree that it is high (more than I paid for my 90 with 13,000 less
&gt;     miles) , but not twice what it should be. Here is one approach that
&gt;     Mark could consider:
&gt;
&gt;     If I am correct, it is a Westfalia GL, not just a GL, so what is the
&gt;     premium for a Westie? Edmunds shows an 87 Camper GL is worth
&gt;     $2775 more than a GL.
&gt;
&gt;     Then there is the Syncro premium. The Blue Books say its worth
&gt;     something like a $500 premium, I suspect the market will pay more.
&gt;
&gt;     Also, we have to consider a premium for having both in the same
&gt;     package...its worth something in the eye of the buyer who will settle
&gt;     for nothing less than a Syncro Westie, because Westies are harder to
&gt;     find than Vans, and Syncros are even harder. Both together is, IMHO,
&gt;     the ultimate late model van. This is much less tangible...
&gt;
&gt;     Edmunds, for what it is worth, says with a mileage adjustment
&gt;     this car is worth, retail (i.e. asking) $9645.  I paid 7% over Edmunds
&gt;     retail price for my 90, and think I got a good deal. So figure 10%
&gt;     over Edmunds as a reasonable deal- so I would come up with something
&gt;     like $10,600.
&gt;
&gt;     Now, FWIW,  if I could have picked up a 87 with these miles
&gt;     for that price, I would have grabbed it...

Sorry, didn't see the WESTFALIA in the posting.  If I may quote Emily Latilla
(Gilda Radner) &quot;Never Mind.&quot;
