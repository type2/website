Subject: Re: Eurovan Awning or ScreenHouse

&gt; 
&gt; I could use some help with a problem that been nagging me for awhile.
&gt; I have a '93 Eurovan Westfalia and I'd like to have an awning or
&gt; screenhouse attached over the sliding cargo door and in a position that
&gt; does not interfere with either the cargo door or the pop-up top.

---deleted--
&gt; 
&gt; I asked several VW dealers and several RV dealers about this and I've been
&gt; turned away. The main justification has been that manufacturers of that
&gt; equipment need the vehicle to have a rain-channel gutter to which they
&gt; attach their equipment. The Eurovan does not have a rain-channel gutter.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Can someone help me with this?  Please don't pass this up since ANY
&gt; information can be more than I know right now!!
&gt; I need to know the source (name, address, telephone), model ID, Price(??),
&gt; or ANY detail or lead to follow.
&gt; 
&gt; Even though I'm in the USA, even if I could get information from some
&gt; other area, it may help.
&gt; 
&gt; If I know it (the awning or screenhouse) exists, some industrious soul or
&gt; business here may be able to order it or make it for me.

Give a call to Camping World (800) 626-5944 and ask for a catalog. They have
5 or 6 pages just of awning and related stuff. They're a mail order company
with outlets in many states.

Regards,               Luis
