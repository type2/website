Subject: Re: My Sliding door does not open?

You may think there's more to it, but all that is holding the outside panel
to the side of the van is the two screws. And of course seven years of crap
that has run down the side of the van and worked it's way in behind it. Try
a rubber hammer, usually a few raps up near the end will release it. Once
that is off you'll see what the problem is. HTH

&gt;Hi folks, I'm havingt trouble opening my sliding door! It seem that the
&gt;little wheel on the outside of the van is not running along the track like
&gt;it should. When I try to open the door the wheel falls of the track on the
&gt;inside side? Kinda a weird to explain. It seems to be very lose. I tryed to
&gt;take the panel off but it seems that u have to do more than take the two
&gt;screews off??? Can anyone help me with this.
&gt;
&gt;Ps I hope I don't have to take the door off to replace that slider wheel?:(
