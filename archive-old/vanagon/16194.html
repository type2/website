Subject: Engine misses, Type IV heads

I've got a 2.0 liter with fuel injection and am wondering if anyone can help
me.  The engine seems to run good (I just put this engine in about a month
ago), but it misses occasionally.  It will work fine for a while and then
all of a sudden miss badly at certain rpm's and loads.  It seems to miss the
worst at a medium load in middle rpm ranges.   ?????
It has a new cap, rotor, and spark plugs.

I noticed in the new Hot VW's there is an article about type IV heads and
the valve seats loosening up.  Has anybody had that problem, and what are
the signs of it beginning.  In the article it says the engine will sound
clanky or bang and there may be a loss in power.  Are there other symptoms?
