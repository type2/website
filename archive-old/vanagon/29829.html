&gt; seeing as how splitty gas tanks are notoriously small i seem to recall
&gt; someone putting in a &quot;newer&quot; stlye (i.e. 1971) fuel tank in their split. i
&gt; can't recall how difficult the fit was, it may have had something to do w/
&gt; the fuel filler neck. personally i think the easiest way to drag along more

I did that on the '56.  Wasn't hard at all.  The only difficult thing is
removing the collar on the new fuel filler neck, 'cause it won't fit
with it on.  Everything else mates up.  YOu have to persuade the top and
bottom rear of the tank a bit with a mallet, about 1/4&quot; or so.  I used
a tank out of a '71, but I'm sure there is a whole range of years that 
would work.

Another option would to be to fabricate a tank.  I've thought of this, 
and have access to someone who can do the welding.  I was thinking of a 
square tank that more completely fills the area in there.  That should be
good for prolly 5-10 more gallons, on top of my 15 gallon tank!  Ya see,
even with the big tank, there is a space on either side about 5&quot; wide and 
maybe 10&quot; tall...  Not to mention the volume gain by not having the rounded
sides of the tank...
