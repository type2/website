&gt;My baby is
&gt;near complete with engine #8.  What would you do?  I'm tempted to trade it
&gt;for a (curse me) Plymouth Voyager to match all the neighbors.

Then you'd have a GOOD reason for all the problems!


&gt;I saw a Mazda conversion engine w. adaptor to VW
&gt;tranny by Kennedy Eng.in So.Cal.  I also have 88 RX7 which runs like the
&gt;old 72 bus.  Could live with a hybrid.  So, whadya think?


If you do it, let me know how it comes out! I'd love to try this.
