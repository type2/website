  Dave,

      DOT 3 has a boiling point less than needed. The fluid could be getting
      to hot and boiling in the system. I have seen this happen in every
      Vanagon DOT 3 was put into. 

      ALso the hose in the cup trick doesn't work. The problem is the
      thread area on the bleeder screw, It's not in the brake fluid!

      Find some DOT 4, and a friend and try again. Let us know what
      happens.

                                                      Eric ZEno
