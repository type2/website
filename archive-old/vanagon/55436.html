&gt; 
&gt; Hi, I wonder how critical the dimension between the cylinder seal area
&gt; and the rubber gasket seal area is? I have found that dimension is
&gt; different between the German heads and the Spanish heads. The Spanish
&gt; heads have less pressure on the rubber gasket.

     Well I had pits in my heads. I took them to a belt sander to
     remove them. So It cann't be that important. It is more
     important that the surface is clean and you use the special
     sealer.
