I got a postcard yesterday from Jennifer in Richard Palmer's cross 
country crew.  She said they had been through Hot Springs, Ark., 
Santa Fe, N.M., &amp; were in Boulder, Co. when she wrote.  They are 
having a great time and she says she is buying her own bus when 
they get back.

Best of luck and &quot;trouble-free motoring&quot; to them all!

Dave
