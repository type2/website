Subject: wind noise

Can anyone else corroborate my &quot;findings&quot;?  I recently swapped the stock
mirrors on my early Vanagon for little Tornado mirrors.  This weekend's
2 hours up, 2 hours back, to/from Litchfield was my first time on the
highway with them.  I think the smaller, much more aerodynamic, mirrors
are significantly quieter.  Does anyone else have experience A-B testing
the stock mirrors versus smaller ones, or even versus the late Vgon power
mirrors, in terms of wind noise?
B.
