&gt; Seeking advice......1990 Vanagon--has sat at dealership for over 20 billable
&gt; hours; Master certified VW mechanic &quot;can not get to run any better&quot;.
&gt;   Problem:  when first starts, stalls several times.  Once running, engine
&gt; always stutters and sputs at idle while tach drifts up and down by several
&gt; hundred revs.  Gets really bad with a.c. on (Which is a lot in Phoenix in the
&gt; summer time).  HELP!!!!!!!!!  hope we are not damaging our motor--have
&gt; already gone through 3 motors in the 71' campmobile this year and am out of
&gt; repair cash!!!

Sounds like our friendly coolant temp. sensor or the idle stablizer valve 
problem that rears its ugly head from time to time.  I would get those
two components checked out and the connections in between.  Make sure
your grounds (battery especially) are good solid connections.
