Subject: wheel cover

Greetings All -

In a general (and negative response) to Dan Flemings request for a wheel
cover, I'd like to add that I need one for my 1980 as well.  Lost this
one on the road to Telegraph Creek, BC, last summer.  It's the one with
the little castle in the middle...rare, I'm told.

Regards,
