&gt;     A minor glitch, but when the address for the &quot;Baywatch&quot; crew cab and 
&gt;     bus were posted last week, I ran out and copied the picture down to my 
&gt;     WindowsNT &quot;wallpaper&quot;.  What I didn't realize at the time was that my 
&gt;     actions nuked the previous wallpaper out of existence.
&gt;     
&gt;     Anyway, where is the &quot;Mass Transit&quot; ad?  It's the one with the nine 
&gt;     Nuns getting into the '66 or so red-and-white deluxe.  I scanned my 
&gt;     saved links, but couldn't come up with a logical path to check out.
&gt;     
&gt;     Any help would be appreciated.

Look in the 'Photos' section.
