Subject: checking transmission

&gt; Would anyone know whether transmissions can be inspected for wear? I'm
&gt; talking about tests that would be akin to checking compression on an
&gt; engine, for example, and that can be performed in, say, less than an hour,
&gt; without taking everything apart. 
&gt; 
&gt; If the only way is a test-drive, what experiments would you suggest?

Well, first I'm going to say don't do this at home but if you do,
an interesting way to get a handle on tranny wear (gear backlash etc)
is to put the vehicle on a lift and rev and let off listening to the
degree of howling noise.  But without a comparison to a known good low
miles box, is sort of hard to judge as all have some backlash.  Here is
a better tip learned from the Quantum Syncro days, drain the damn oil
before you buy, every drop into a clean pan, make sure 
1. you get out at least 85% of the rated fill capacity
2. you see no obvious particles or a shiny metallic film of extrem
bearing/sychro wear.
3. if the thing doesnt pop out of gears and generates no noise in a test
of good lenght and a lot of shifting I figure that is about all one
could do.

Does anyone do oil analysis on tranny oil? Might consult the local farm
supply store or perforance shop that does engine oil analisis, seems
like they should be able to pick up on wear particles in tranny oil as
well, but I don't know.  Personally I think draining the oil is a
great idea that I'll do with any car of questionable repute from now
on, at least pull the fill plug and see how low it is.

John who accidently bought the Quantum nearly 1 qt low though it
still gave me 50k of good service and has aquired anothe 50k with
current owner with the box howling to beat all hell
