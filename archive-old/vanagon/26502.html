Subject:       shift points

Last night I installed one of those $19.95 tachometers in my '72 bus. 
It's pretty cool to watch the needle bounce around while I am driving 
but it still doesn't do me any good because I dont know where the 
factory recomended shift and red line points are.  If anyone has a 
clue for a 1700 please let me know.
 thanks.
 Ed.
