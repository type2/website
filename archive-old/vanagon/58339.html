Subject: New way to bleed wasserboxer?

While checking for exhaust gases in my coolant, I got lots of air in the
system.  I have not enjoyed following the bleeding procedure in Bentley,
 kind of like doing taxes.  Since I was by myself, I tried a different
approach this time.  Elevated the front of the van like before.  Ran the
engine and revved it up several times to make sure bubbles got circulated.  A
moderate bubble developed uder the expansion tank cap and I bled this bit by
cracking open the cap just a touch and closed it just as fluid started
running out.  

Then I opened the bleeder screw on the radiator while the engine continued to
idle.  I found some small gauge nylon tubing(used for a oil presssure gauge
in my Triumph) and created a syphon from a jug of coolant into the bleeder
hole.  The jug would rest against the windshield and a wiper by itself.  The
tube was small enough to let escaping air pass around it.  When coolant
started flowing out I just put the bleeder screw back in.  The whole process
took about 15 min but was a whole lot less spastic than the Bentley
procedure.  Seemed to work well.  Does anyone know why this wouldn't work?
