Subject: EV appliance woes

perhaps it would helpful for everyone to note their fridge model/serial #,
the year EV they have, and whether they've had any problems with it.
Also what altitude or other relevant weather conditions were at hand.
The serial numbers can be found in the front of the book that came with the
van (the big gray binder from Winnebago.)
Admittedly the 25+ EVs on this list are a small sample, but if you can go
to the dealer armed with the knowledge of X other people with similar
problems,
they might listen.
(It would also provide data to be forwarded to the FTC which is what you
would have to do to truly initiate a recall campaign.)

also i'd like to know the official name &amp; part number for this Norcold kit
- i'll have to test mine out this summer.

If you want to just send the data to me, I'll gladly put it all together
(and put it up on the Web for future reference.)
