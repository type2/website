&gt; I ordered one a couple of months ago from RMMW (The Bus Stop).  I'm not sure
&gt; what the difference between the OEM and &quot;cheapie&quot; version is, but the one
&gt; I got looked pretty much the same as the one I took off.  (I mean, I didn't
&gt; look at it THAT close to compare.)  It seems to work fine.  And I'm not sure,
&gt; but I THINK that problems with being able to get into reverse without
&gt; pushing down on the shifter would have more to do with the FRONT part of
&gt; the mechanism, like the shifter itself or the guide plate.  (I'm thinking
&gt; if adjustment doesn't work, you might need to put washers either under the
&gt; guide plate or between the guide plate and the metal &quot;boot&quot; that goes over
&gt; it, for shims.)


The reason I replaced the coupler originally turned out to be
that the cage would turn independantly of the collar with the 
setscrew. Sometimes it would go into first/second just fine, other
times took some major searching. This kinda returned last week, and 
on Saturday, I put it in second, moved the shift lever from side
to side, put it in neutral, pulled back on the shift lever, and
then went backward instead of forward. Moved the shift lever from
side to side again, and after the N/2nd shift, had second gear again.
I think this is telling me that the shift lever is rotating without
always moving the transmission end in a like manner....like when
the cage was moving independanly from the shaft. I crawled under
to eyeball it, but have not watched it from below while someone
shifts. The cage seems to be in good shape, however.

Hmmmmmm.
