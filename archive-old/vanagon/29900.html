&gt; If my recollection is correct wasn't the Le Car a car of the year?
&gt; or was it that horrible AMC/Renault mutation?  I'd really like to do a
&gt; survey of &quot;Cars of The Year&quot; and see just how many of those abominations
&gt; are still running...

Ummm... what does this have to do with Volkswagen vans?  And as long as
I'm venting, the Renault 5 was quite popular in Europe, and made an
impressive rally car.  I believe one was even featured in a James Bond
movie.  Certainly no abomination!
