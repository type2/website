Ahhh.... The old &quot;we aint got no steenkin' bearings....for that&quot; response.  
I would start out at your local alternator rebuider...the guy that actually 
has a shop that REBUILDS alternators, you should be able to get your unit 
rebuilt for about what....$60 or so?  He should have bearings.  If not at 
that shop, somewhere nearby must be a &quot;bearing&quot; shop....try the yellow 
pages, take your fried bearings in to them, look at the numbers on the 
outside or shoulder, or even measure the shaft and race and find a 
replacement that way....

The bearings in the alternator of the '87 Syncro seem to be telling that 
that
they are not much longer for this world.  VW wants $285 (before 15% 
discount)
for one and FLAPS wants $149 (before 10% discount).  I had just replaced the
brush/regulator in this a month ago.  My question is:  Are bearings 
available
for the 90 amp alternator.  I'm being told &quot;no&quot; here.  Anybody else had any
luck getting these bearings?
