Subject: The Christmas Fool

To All:

Two weeks ago I took my '65 bus off the road to replace the tranny, a chore
I've been putting off for a couple of years.  I figured I would have it up &amp;
running in five or six days. 

Pulled the engine, then the tranny, then started doing 'little' chores.
 Replacing the emergency brake cables, running a new loom of wires for an
overhead instrument console, replacing a tie-rod, adjusting the link-pins,
doing the rear brakes... and later the front ones.  They little jobs had
nothing to do with the tranny swap but with the bus in the air and the tools
all laid out, it was just too good an opportunity to pass up.

I rebuilt the outboard gear boxes and put everything back together, all
nicely painted.  Scrubbed the grunge off the underside of the bus and painted
most of that before starting to put things back together.

Got the tranny, axles and brakes installed then tore down the engine enough
to retorque the heads, do some minor cleaning, check the clutch &amp; end play,
add an oil temp sender and another oil pressure sender, the old one having
develped a leak.

Plugged the engine back in, turned the vehicle around so I could roll it on
level concrete, adjusted the toe-in, fired it up.  Horrible!  Shut it off. 

It sounded like a valve problem.  The engine has hydraulic lifters so a
little clatter is normal after sitting for two weeks but this -- it sounded
like there was something loose inside the engine!  

Since the problem had not been there before I tore things apart, I went over
everything I had done.  Part of the engine maintenance was renewing the
gaskets on the exhaust system, which involved removing the heat exchangers
and muffler.  I also replaced the intake manifold with one having a cleaner
heat riser.  Small things, but a lot of them.  

I checked everything, right down to re-doing the valve adjustments.  Started
it up.  Horrible clatter!  It sounded like a loose washer on the fan pulley.
 Or mebbe the alternator.  Or mebbee....

The truth is, since the Grendel Episode I've lost confidence in my diagnostic
abilities.  I called Roland Wilhelmy, begged him to lend me his ear.  He came
by, drove the bus and we worried together.  There was definitely something
there.  Maybe it WAS the alternator.  We decided running the engine without
the alternator would be a good test so I pulled the fan belt...  and found my
8mm box-end wrench laying under the fan pulley.  I'd misplaced it when
tightening the lead to the alternator.  It had been vibrating, occasionally
touching the fan pulley, generating a musical ringing.

No excuse for it, other than being a damned fool.  But finding that wrench
was the nicest kind of Christmas present :-)
