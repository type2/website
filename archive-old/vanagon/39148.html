Subject: Census

 If all the listees would mail me a message with a few pieces of
information, I would take the task of doing the census.

 Information needed:

 Location: city, state, country
 Type of vehicle(s) and year

 On the types of vehicles, if you have other VW's aside from busses/vans,
you might want to include them in the message, although, I won't add them to
the summary. This would be to match people with similar vehicles.

 Another idea that might work is to put parts that you have that want to
sell and parts that you need. I could make a database of these parts and
vehicles if everyone agrees to implement this idea. Although, the only way
this would work is by having readily available the e-mail addresses as a
minimum. The best scenario would be to have the e-mail address and a phone
number.

 If all agree to the above, I'll compile the information and maybe one of
the people in the list that has a home page would be kind enough to post
vehicles and parts for sale and wanted and the FAQs or procedures for doing,
fixing, etc.

 My major problem is about parts that are compatible with the different year
vehicles. I would love to compile a list that does just this. Wouldn't that
be nice to have something like this available?

 Why am I willing to do this? I know that most of you don't mind answering
questions once in a while but me, well, I'm a newbie and have been pestering
the daylights out of Mr. Fitzpatrick, Mr. Kinsey and others. I do want to
thank these two gentlemen for helping me with the answers to my infinite
questions.

 I have some pieces of information that wouldn't mind sharing and would like
to make them available to all. I have found several sources of used manuals
and books related to VW's that the majority of the people don't have the
time to look for and these are the direct consequences of snooping around in
the Internet. Believe it or not, there are manuals out there and at a very
reasonable price, either new or used. So, if you agree to the above, let me
know and I'll try to do a timely job.
