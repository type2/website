It's my time to say my farewells to the list.

I'm droping off the list as of close of business Friday, 11  August 1995.

This position, allowed me to have access to the 'net', was mainly inexistence while I 
was completing school.

I've been able to stay a bit longer but the writing is clearly one the wall; the funding 
for it is about to end.

We are planning to pack up move to the Mid-West; outside of Saint Louis, MO.

Next week we are off to Saint Louis (Lewis &amp; Clark style).

&gt;From that point only GOD knows.

Hope to be in touch with you soon and perhaps re-join the list later.

The best to all of you. (but of course, you're starting with a Volkswagon so you've got 
an advantage of most of the world already. ;)
