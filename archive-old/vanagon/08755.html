&gt; I already did replace the temperature gauge sending unit, as I mentioned 
&gt; in an earlier post.
&gt; 
sorry, I must have missed/forgotten that

&gt; I have not replaced the ECU sending unit, and will give that some &gt;
attention.  As a minimum, I'll check the contacts on both.  I wish there &gt;
were an easy way (without looking at the schematic yet, I can't tell) to &gt;
do a continuity check, and in any case, I'd be loath to do a continuity &gt;
check on the ECU piece without knowing what kind of current it can take. &gt;

I doubt very seriously that the ECU sending unit has anything to do with 
this, and aside from that all it does is measure temperature and adjust 
your fuel delivery accordingly, it has nothing to do with cooling system 
function.

&gt; I don't know if the fluid coming out of the radiator was cool or not, &gt;
probably not, but remember, this problem is intermittent.  I can't think &gt;
of any thing that will cause the engine to genuinely run hot sometimes &gt;
without turning on the fan, assuming the fan works (which it seems to), &gt;
except for an intermittent thermostat.  I agree, they dont' tend to be &gt;
intermittent in my experience, either. &gt; &gt; In any event, I at least know
where the thermostat is located, so when I &gt; get around to replacing it I
can do so.  I really need to get this thing &gt; running over the holidays,
becuase I dont' have a place to work on it at &gt; night and it gets a little
cold here in Iowa sometimes.  (There is a &gt; tractor in my shop, and
someone said they hadn't seen a positive ground &gt; system for a long while
so I won't boor you with the electrical system on &gt; this tractor -
sufficie it to say it's 12 volt, at least &lt;g&gt;. &gt; &gt; Thanks &gt; &gt; &gt; Jim -

&gt; &gt; 
I'm pretty much ready to admit that it must be the thermostat, it's going 
to be messy, you might as well flush the cooling systme at this point and 
refill with PHOSPHATE-FREE coolant.  Read the files in the gopher server 
on changing the coolant and bleeding:
