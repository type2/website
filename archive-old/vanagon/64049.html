&gt; &gt;While out camping in our '82 Westy this weekend my son and I managed to
&gt; &gt;break the water spout (the piece the water comes out of, I'm not sure if
&gt; &gt;I'm communicating well here or not) off of the pump down low where it
&gt; &gt;swings vertically.  Where is the best place to get one?
 
&gt; Euro-American RV Products
&gt; 5517 Cleon Avenue
&gt; North Hollywood, CA 91601 
&gt;(This used to be Delta Six Industries, which originally supplied many of
&gt;the camper parts to Westfalia.)


I also carry these (as well as most popular Delta Six items).
