Subject: Re: Roof Racks

&gt;    I should like to get a roof rack for Ramona since this trailer plan seems
&gt;to be disolving as I learn more and more about the traumas I'd be subjecting
&gt;her to by forcing her into trailer slavery.
&gt;    Does anyone know of a local place I could shop for one of these??? (New
&gt;England) Is there a universal rack avail. thru some RV dealers, or do I have
&gt;to buy a custom rack? I didn't see one avail. in my Bus Stop catalog, nor in
&gt;the JC Whitney I've got. Are these just impossible to come across??????
&gt;    (You guys sick of my incessant questions yet???)   Rach
&gt;

Rach.,
No we're not sick of your questions.  I'm not sure I agree with your
assessment of the trailer vs. roof rack situation.  In the long run a
trailer could very well be easier on the engine than wind-loading the bus
with a roof rack.  It may depend on how well you can pack the rack, so that
it doesn't catch too much wind.  But a trailer is very good with the wind,
and as along as the trailer itself is light and has a nice running load,
good bearings and tires etc., I'd go with a good lightweight, small trailer.

I really like the way my new engine feels with the non-detergent oil, I will
probably not switch back until supply forces me to.

Did you catch that post about the 1641 in San Diego running too hot?

Eug,
