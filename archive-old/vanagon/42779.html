Subject: The wife, WTB: Vanagon, FS:, and Thanks!

Volks Folks,

Thanks to all those who answered my posts about which model Vanagon to find
for the wife.  VW people are GREAT!!!

Our new baby (#3) isn't due until September so the wife can get by with her
Jetta until then and probably a little longer if need be.  But I'm going to
try and find a nice Vanagon sooner rather than later though.  I can either
buy outright or possibly work a trade for either my '67 21 window micro, my
'57 sunroof beetle, or the wife's '87 Jetta.  Anyway....

Wanted:  1986 or newer Vanagon with 2.1 liter engine.  Must have 7 passenger
seating and A/C.  Would prefer a GL, Weekender, or Carat edition with
Automatic Trans but will seriously consider anything in good to great
condition.  

This will be for the wife and family vacations so reliabilty is a must.  If
you have or know of something for sale that meets our desires, please E-mail
direct.  (Willing to travel)

THANKS,
Dan Kinsey
