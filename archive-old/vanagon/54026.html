Subject: Re: Re(2): Rubber Floor Mats for Vanagon

 Charles,
The number for Parts Place is (810) 373-2300 and fax (810)373-5950. I 
lost my catalog, so I don't have the part number. I don't have them so I 
can't give you any info re quality, although they look good :) Maybe 
someone else on the list has them?

&gt; Thanks for your help with the Vanagon rubber floor mats.  I'd be interested in
&gt; looking into the Parts Place mats.  If you have the phone number, please E-Mail
&gt; it back to me.  I am wondering how heavy-dury the plastic ones are.  Will they
&gt; hold mud and snow?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
