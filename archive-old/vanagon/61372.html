&gt; Help please for me also!     I just uncovered the same problem (thought
&gt; when I got it to light the problems were over.
&gt; 
&gt; On mine, with 110v or 12v, cooling is adequate and the box eventually gets
&gt; down to ~30 deg F.
&gt; With Gas, the lowest it gets is ~50F (outside at 70).   This applies either
&gt; stopped on the level or in motion (12v or gas).   I'm going to take it out
&gt; and see if the orifice is restricted, but the burner sounds like it's doing
&gt; its thing when it's on, and there is heat.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone have any ideas?

&gt; &gt;After many months of study, pondering, frustration, and fidgeting with my
&gt; &gt;refrigerator, I've come to the conclusion that I NEED HELP!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have an 83 Westy with a burdening fridge.  The 120V heater will cool
&gt; &gt;the refrigerator adequately but the gas wont.  The gas burner will get
&gt; &gt;the chimney much hotter than the 120V heater element but the fins in the
&gt; &gt;box don't cool with gas.
&gt; &gt; As you can see my problem isn't that my burner wont light.  There is
&gt; &gt;something else.  The refrigerator is level.  As I cried before, PLEASE
&gt; &gt;HELP!
