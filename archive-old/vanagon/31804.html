Subject: Need some hardware updates

Hi All,
    I'm looking for your help.  I'm hoping that someone might know where I
might get a external or internal hardrive for my Mac. I've got a 40meg now,
and need more. I'm looking for used, I know where to go for new, just don't
have that kind of cash. Also looking maybe to upgrade from this aging
Macintosh LC to something better. If anyone knows where I can score anyone
of these items please E-mail me ASAP.  Thanks.

                        Keep on Busin' -Jim D
