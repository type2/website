Subject:  75 Bus Oil Filter/ Can I use Golf/Filter from VW

After reading past posts I will no longer use Bosch Oil Filters, I only used
one once. No problems but I guess VW filters are better.  I recall reading
in the back area of the Idiots guide where Tosh Gregg mentions using a
rabbit filter in his bus.  I own a 86 Golf and my father has a 90 Golf and I
believe they use the same filters as the Rabbit. We have a case of these
so, If I can use this please let me know.  It will save me a trip and to be
honest those filters are a lot easier to get on and off.  It hard to get a grip
on the wide filter.  
                                                        

                                              Peace, Love, VW and the Grateful Dead,
