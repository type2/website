&gt;Has anyone had experience in adding &quot;driving lights&quot; for daytime use to a

Hella makes some half-driving/half-fog lights that might fit the bill. but
the problem is that mounting them down on the bumper (the only place to do
it) makes them less effective, in terms of other people seeing you. the
safest (easiest?) thing would be to come up with the headlight fixtures from
Canada for the same year ... they have the Daytime Running Lights bulb
fixtures already made into the headlight reflectors.

&gt;Westy doesn't have the 3rd brakelight.  What do you think about adding one
&gt;in the back window?  How hard is it to do?

not tooooo hard. the worst part is running the wire(s) to the hatch, IF you
follow the wiring for the defroster. :(

but!! why put the light ON the back window?? why not attach it to the overhead
camper a/c cabinet?? there should be enough room between the glass and the
cabinet to fit one of those J.C.Whitney $15 LED brake lights, and that way,
it wouldn't get in the way of the rear hatch glass or curtains or whatever.

and it would be a helluva lot simpler to wire than my dual extra lights in
the lower corners of the rear window. :(
