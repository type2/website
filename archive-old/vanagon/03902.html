Subject: Front end heat &amp; awnings

I'm new to the List and have really been enjoying it.
I have two questions:
1.  My 82 diesel Westfalia camper, which I've had for about 6-months, 
seems to pump out an inordinate amount of heat from the dashboard heater 
area even when the heater is off. Is this just something I have to live 
with or am I doing something wrong as far as heater lever settings or is 
something haywire mechanically. The BEDBUG seems to run great otherwise. 
This is my first vw of any type. It fulfills a dream I've had for better 
than 20-years. I love it.
2.  I live in the Pacific Northwest (Olympia, WA, to be exact). Is there 
a dealer up here that sells awnings designed for vw campers or similar?
Replys by e-mail best as I'd guess these aren't new questions.
Thanks
Dave
