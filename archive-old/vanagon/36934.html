&gt;For example. My 86 Type II has the same tires  front and back, however, the
&gt;weight isn't evnely distributed. VW sez put 35PSI in the front, and 41PSI
&gt;in the back. Same Tires! I assume this is due to more wieght in the back.
&gt;Further I assume the wieght distribution is directly related to the tire
&gt;pressures. That is 35/46ths or 46% front axle, and 42/76ths or 54% on the
&gt;back axle.
&gt;NOTE: This is speculation, not known facts!

Having the front tires at a lower inflation than the rears is also used to
make vehicle understeer. A desirable charecteristic for a vehicle of this
type.  With radial tires, maximum tire life, fuel econmy, and handling
response is allways obtained with the tire inflated to the maximum pressure
as listed on the tire sidewall.  Vehicle manufacturers specs are to improve
ride and handling characteristics.  New car dealers often underflat tires on
new cars to give that soft, quiet, new car ride.  Well designed radials do
not show abnormal tread wear patterns from normal pressur variations as bias
ply and cord tires did.
