Subject: q/a on hot start problem
Date: Tue, 30 Aug 94 11:01:28 EDT

Someone on the list recently contacted me with a question regarding the
hot start problem I was having with the 82 westfalia FI system. I have
accidently deleted their address. Could they please post their query
again? I think the question was regarding a BMW FI system... thanks in
advance - DC --
