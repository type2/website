Subject: Re: Suspander Rear Hatch struts

(excerpt from recent post from Co. called Tuetonix?):
&gt;Even if you don't purchase from us, beware of the Suspander Brand.  &gt;They
are grossly substandard and Teutonix refuses to sell them 
&gt;anymore.

Yikes! I just purchased (phone/mail order) a pair of what I was told were
reputable hatch struts from a place in upstate NY called VW PARTS. Upon
opening pkg. today, I see they're Suspanders... can't put on for a day or
two, but are they really no good? Anyone beg to differ (I hope!)?
