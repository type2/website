Subject: Hello, and thanks in advance!

Hello,

I just joined the list here and am about to take a plunge.  I hope posting
a message like this is kosher.

I am about to buy what I believe to be a '69 CamperMobile.  It seems to be
in decent shape.  The rust is primarily surface and even then very minimal.
No dents, no massives scrapes or stuff.  It has no fridge or faucet but
the other stuff seems to be there.  Has five good tires.  It is $250.

Oh, yea, small, minor point - it has no engine!

I do not need this for transport right now although it is conceivable that
I might at one point or another.

My dream has always been to take a VW Bus (I used to own many Bugs) and
completely refurb it.  I would want to do all the work myself even if it
took awhile - or at least a major portion of it.  I have never done
ANYTHING like this before.

Questions for all you who are in the awareness:

A)  Is it a good 'deal'?
B)  Is it possible or am I setting myself up for failure?
C) Anything in particular that I should look for which would rule this
PARTICULAR bus out as far as a candidate.

Thanks.  Your answers whether public or private would be most helpful and
appreciated.

-Marlin
