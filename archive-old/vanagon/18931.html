Subject: Westy vent assembly

I just ordered and received some replacement parts for the top vent 
window on our 85 westy.  However, the original parts were so damaged, I 
don't know the correct way to install the new ones.  The problem is with 
the part called the flex arm actuator(the y shaped part with 2 small 
plastic wheels).  When installed, are the wheels supposed to glide in the 
channel through the opening and closing process?  Is the arm supposed to 
bend when opening and closing?  I installed the part, but the whhels come 
out of the channel, and the top of the arm bends.  The vent opens fine 
even though the arm bent a bit, but the vent won't close without severe 
bending, and keeps jamming.  I have to hold the arms in with one hand and 
turn the crank withe the other to close it.  Any ideas?  Thanks in advance.
