&lt;&lt; Is it possible to replace the glass in the (manual) outside mirror on an 
 '84?  I have one with a broken mount and good glass and one that's the 
 opposite and would like to make one good mirror.  The local junkyard was 
 all out (gave me the broken one free) and the dealer seems unable to 
 order left side mirrors (the keep getting right side mirrors that are 
 mislabeled!).

there  are a couple parts suppliers, even some on this list :&lt;) that sell the
mirrors for 10 or 15 bucks apiece.
don't waste your time on it, just buy a new one.
