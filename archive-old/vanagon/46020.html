Help,

I had a small hardware problem today (nut loose behind the keyboard) and
lost my mail files.  I think I read a post for a 1990 or 1991 weekender or
westy for sale in the VA or MD area.  I have a friend looking to purchase
one ASAP.  Please let me know if anyone can find it.

Thanks for the help.
