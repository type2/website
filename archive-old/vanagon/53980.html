&gt;&gt; now, that said, i DO carry a cheap set
&gt;&gt;  of Chinese sockets in the van at all times.  they are intended to pay for
&gt;&gt;  themselves ONCE, when i break down.  the Snap-Ons pay for themselves
&gt;&gt;  repeatedly in the garage.

&gt;I use the same arrangement of &quot;cheap&quot; &amp; &quot;good&quot; tools in the car &amp; garage.
&gt; I've found myself question this practice though.  If you (or I) are broken
&gt;down somewhere, isn't that precisely the time you would want to have your
&gt;best tools to work with??

Hello All,
	I get good tools where I can, a Sears &quot;sale&quot; is the time to pick up what I
can afford for the car. I carry a Craftsman breaker bar &amp; socket (paid
regular price) for the lug nuts, and real vice grips. At the 'day after
Thanksgiving 8-10 am sale&quot; this year I picked up a 1/4 socket set and a
combo wrench set for $10 each. Put'em in an old tool box and leave them
alone until I need them.
	Of course if I'm going on a trip, then I take &quot;Tools&quot; with me...but that's
another story.
	Later on folks.

	Rob
