Subject: OOFF road manual


	I just got the off road manual from Tobin;
its simply marvelous.  The pics of breaking down a bead
using the jack are something I had never seen, and a super
great/valuable idea.

	I plan to build an engine gaurd like right away,
and perhaps one for the gearbox.  I might be able to make
more than one of them......
 
	Also, how come I never get to travel to exotic locals
and have my picture taken in front of tropical trees on the beach? ;)

Later
