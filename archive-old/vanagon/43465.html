Subject: saw a used EV Camper for sale...

... up in Port Angeles, Wa, late last night when coming home from Victoria.
Couldn't stop, but there aren't *that* many car dealers up there.
Since one doesn't see these models used very often, I thought I'd let y'all
know in case you want to hunt it down for yourself.

I've been out of town all week and just got done scanning all the TOC in
the digests. Regarding EV hood collecting water - I've had mine in enough
rain storms that if it didn't drain properly it would be quite noticeable
by now.
Check for plugged drain holes or tubes leading out.
