&gt;Bringing this back to the list - how many of you bring your pets along on 
&gt;your various excursions and what do they think about it? 

My year and a half Dalmation LOVES to travel in my 85 Westy.  He likes all
the windows and the open room.  I always have a bowl of food and water for
him during the trip.  The only time its bothersome is when he barks at
oncoming cars.  Only seems to do this at highway speeds in wooded areas.
 Hmmmm....
