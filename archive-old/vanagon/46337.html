Hi,

It is LEGAL to bring hunting rifles and shotguns through Canada to 
Alaska!  No side arms are permitted by the Canadians though.  

As far as personel protection is concerned, no need to bother, our Bear 
population is cool and rather laid back.......HOWEVER watch out for our 
Alaskan ladies over 50, some can be extremely dangerous when 
provoked!!!!!!!

If you feel the nead for some kind of protection pick up some Alaskan 
PEPPER spray for bears......._dot_comes in the size of a large can of tire 
foam, then take it back home and frighten the local thugs!!!!!!

Regards,

Chris Gibbs 88 Westfalia in Alaska.
