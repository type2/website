I'd just like to ad my $.02 to this piece - Electric Cars.

Electric Cars are being touted as THE alternative to the internal
combustion engined vehicles we are all driving now. Yep, these
cars themselves don't pollute.....but the generating plants
that develop the power to re-charge these vehicles do!

To convert to having a majority of electric vehicles is going
to mean a major increase in the generating capacity of this
country. That means new generating plants....more use of
either fossil or nuclear fuels. Couple that with the idea
that electrical generation under conventional methods is
not all that mechanically efficient...and, by the way, neither
is recharging batteries. So there is a double whammy effect
here.

If we are going to have alternative power sources for our cars,
I don't believe &quot;plug in&quot; electrical vehicles are a long term
answer....a technology such as fuel-cell or solar cell is...
but as Bob said in his first posting, big industry decides
what is good for us. And what bigger industry is there than
the power industry!

IMHO,

Ric
