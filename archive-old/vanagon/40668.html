 Subject: Westfalia Tent

  What's a Westfalia tent from a '70 camper worth?  The original VW was
  destroyed years ago, and my son sold his 73 last year, so I have no use for
  it.  It is in near new shape, having been used for less than a dozen times.
  This tent is the one which has an external metal tube frame, and fastens
  to the gutter over the sliding door.  When set up, it makes an additional
  room which connects to the camper, yet can be used as a separate tent.
  By the way, it is in the SF Bay area.
