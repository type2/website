Subject: Security System Alarm Location

I am currently on my second Viper 300 (now 300+) security system in my
second '91 Westy. The original system worked fine the entire two years I
had it. Unfortunately I never really inspected just where the &quot;horn&quot; part
was installed. I know they probably told me, but it worked fine and I
never had to worry about it.

On my new - 1 month old - system, the alarm suddenly turned into a shrill
ear piercing pitch. Upon return to the installer/seller, the techie installed
a new &quot;siren/horn&quot; (too long a day deadens the brain cells - the device that
produces the sound!). He discerned that it had somehow gotten water into
its inner parts and the water had effected the pitch. The new one is installed
in a similar location with saran wrap over the horn opening - but my fear is
that this will happen again. 

I know that the previous one was somewhere else - but I don't know where. The
installer/seller no longer has the same techie onboard. (The old techie was
a VW owner - and knew more about the vehicle anatomy).

I am looking for input on proper/good locations of the horn piece to produce
the best alarm sound - but to be protected from the chance of water getting
into the mechanics. Any/all advice would be appreciated.

Thankx -
	Kenyon
