Subject:      Fuel Pump or Vacuum Leak?

I finally got around to working on my '83 air-cooled Vanagon.  After some
stalling problems, I acertained that I either had a fuel pump problem or a
vacuum leak.  Of course I found that the latter was the case after replacing the
fuel pump!  No regrets though since I now have a spare pump (something I always
thought I should have) and I replaced some rotten fuel line.  As it turns out,
the problem was a pesky little rubber elbow (part # 049 133 783) that connects
to the aux. air regulator.  It was cracked on the underside and was not visible.
 My local VW dealer charges $13 for it and its not in stock!  I think perhaps
I'll tape the cracks for now until I can find a cheaper replacement (I refuse to
pay $13 for a 50 cent part).

Thanks to all those that posted suggestions to the problem!

Jesse
