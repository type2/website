&gt; please put the year of the bus in the subject line.   There being so  so much
&gt; on this mailing list, those of us not interested in the 80 westy or  early
&gt; steering or whatever can skip over it.    

Amen!  Or at least &quot;split&quot; or &quot;breadloaf&quot; &quot;vanagon&quot; or &quot;eurovan&quot; - makes it
a lot easier to filter mail!
