&gt; 
&gt;&gt;I own a 81
&gt;&gt;Jetta Diesel with close to 400,000 miles on it and it still gets 45
&gt;&gt;m.p.g.'s Can't afford to get rid of it. 
&gt; 
&gt;Damn!  I thought we had the record with 263,000 on our '81 Jetta diesel.
&gt;&lt;Sigh...&gt;  Time for a few (dozen) cross-country trips....
&gt; 


My Rabbit lost its head around 310,000 :(  But my work beater- 1983 Ford
F-250 4x4 (6.9L IH) is still going at 359,000! it burns no oil and gets
20mpg consistantly, not bad for a 3/4ton with 3:55 gears!, IH did
something right with this engine... OR was my oil changes every 3,000???

RJ.
