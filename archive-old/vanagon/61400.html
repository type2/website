Subject:      tune up

&gt;I was wondering if anyone knew of a list of things to have done for a
&gt;tune up.  I have a 1980 Westy with an aircooled engine.  I just wanted
&gt;some guidelines to go by when looking for a good mechanic.  If anyone
&gt;knows a basic list of things that need to be checked, changed, or
&gt;replaced every once and a while, it would really help me out.

well, here's a list of stuff from the old days. it still applies to even
the water-cooled vanagons and eurovans. :)

Do be done at every ...

3000 miles:
- adjust valves (cold engine) &lt;yours has hydraulic lifters so you do NOT need
  do do this&gt;
- check fan belt tension.
- check timing and dwell (ignition timing and points)
- replace oil (and filter)
- check battery water level &lt;since yours is inside the bus, this isn't
  as necessary as often&gt;
- check fluid level in windshield washer tank.
- check exhaust system/pipes for leaks, damage.
- manual transmission: check clutch pedal for free play.
- check drive shaft boots for leaks, cracks.
- check front axle dust seals on ball joints and tie rod ends.
- check steering play.
- check tires for wear patterns and proper inflation.
  don't forget the spare tire. &lt;and carry a GOOD tire pressure gauge AND
  a really good bicycle tire pump&gt;
- check brake system for proper fluid level, leaks, damage.
- check brake pedal for free play and pedal travel.
- check operation of electrical systems:
  headlights, high beam indicator, parking lights, side marker lights,
  license plate lights, emergency/hazard flasher, stop lights, tail lights,
  backup lights, turn signals, horn, rear window defogger.
- check headlight alignment.
- check operation of windshield wiper and washer.
- automatic transmission: check ATF level.
                          check proper operation/indication of shifter.

6000 miles:
do ALL the 3000 mile stuff PLUS ...
- lubricate door hinges and sliding door mounting points

12000 miles:
do all the 6000 mile stuff PLUS ...
- replace ignition breaker points.
  adjust dwell angle. check timing.
- replace spark plugs.

18000 miles:
do all the 12000 miles stuff PLUS ...
- lubricate front end &lt;i don't think your 80 has any lube points on the
    suspension&gt;
- replace air cleaner filter.

24000 miles:
do all the 18000 mile stuff PLUS ...
- automatic transmission: replace fluid
- manual transmission:    replace fluid
- replace brake fluid

for the water-cooled types:
- replace the coolant fluid

and if you have it:
- replace the power steering fluid

and that's pretty much it. the 3000 miles works out to about every other
month or so. i dropped my oil changes down to 2500 miles, and the other
stuff down to multiples of 2500.

one thing that i did which might help:
get some graph paper with large squares, about 1/4 inch on a side. starting
on the left side, list each of the things (listed above) that you want to
do to the bus regarding maintenance. then, in the columns, across the top
of the page, list the milage at which you want to do these things. and as
you do then, put an 'X' or color in 1/2 the square. like this:

                                1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 3
                          2 5 7 0 2 5 7 0 2 5 7 0
                          5 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 0
                          0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
                          0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
- change oil/filter       X X X X / / / / / / / /
- lube door hinges          X   X   /   /   /   /
- replace spark plugs           X       /       /
- replace tranny fluid                  /
- replace brake fluid                   /

where the X means &quot;i already did this at the specified mileage&quot; and the
/ means &quot;i need to do this when that mileage comes around&quot;. so it's a sort
of little graph of what needs to be done, when it needs to be done, and
whether you did it at that mileage. :)  sort of a &quot;check-list&quot;.

p.s. i'm not sure what you meant about &quot;finding a mechanic&quot; ... i guess you
mean by asking HIM what he does for a 3000 mile &quot;service&quot; or some such??
most of this stuff isn't &quot;hard&quot; ... just time consuming. each 3000 mile
service will eat up a good bit of a saturday ... but it's only every OTHER
month. so it's like you have to give up one weekend out of every eight.
as the miles accumulate, the 6000, 12000 and so forth stuff takes a little
longer, but then, you get faster as you learn how to do it.

way back when i had my air-cooled buses, i'd park it overnight in the position
where i could work on it next morning. i'd do the valves first, then check
the timing, then crank it up (to check the valves and timing while it was
running). this would get the oil nice and hot (especially if i test drove it),
then i'd change the oil and filter. it worked out nicely and only the oil
change had to be done on a hot engine. so you work it out in a sequence of
what-needs/can-be-done-on-a-cold-engine and what-needs/can-be-done-on-a-hot-
engine. do the cold stuff first, then warm up the engine, and do the hot
stuff. like that.

hope it helps. :)
