For the record, the PO of my 86 GL had the same problem, cost him $800
to have it fixed by VW and it's still a little stiff.

&gt; When my 86 stuck in third gear it turned out to be a broken gear. If
&gt; memory serves me it was the 3rd/4th sliding cog. Not a lot of fun to change but I did it my self (borrowed one tool from dealer).
&gt; Good Luck

&gt; &gt;Recently the third gear in the transmission of my 84 vanagon has
&gt; &gt;started
&gt; &gt;sticking.  It slides into gear OK although it doesn't feel as smooth
&gt; &gt;as the
&gt; &gt;other gears.  However, sometimes, at irregular intervals, it doesn't
&gt; &gt;want to
&gt; &gt;come out of gear and I have to fiddle with it in order to disengage.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;When the engine oil seal was changed in January, the mechanic said the
&gt; &gt;clutch was in good condition. None of the other gears are having a
&gt; &gt;problem
&gt; &gt;-----YET!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Does anyone have any information on this?  Can you reply by email as I
&gt; &gt;am
&gt; &gt;off the newsgroup for about another month.
