Subject: RE: Shifter Jams--Thanks, Richard!

Thanks for the solution to my shifter ball popping out of my linkage cup 
problem, Richard.  I read your response on Sunday evening and the jam hit 
me Monday morning on the way to work.  I didn't have the one inch washer, 
but I used a 1&quot; nut about 1/4&quot; thick that fit in the hold-down plate 
neatly.  I tried to make it jam after work and it held like a trooper.  
Thanks again,
