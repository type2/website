Chris,

&gt; Looking to purchase a Syncro in the near future.  Looking to all for
&gt;  advice on what to look(out) for!

Syncros were imported to the USA in 86, 87, 89, 90, &amp; 91.
All came equipped with the 2.1L flat four watercooled engine making 90HP and
a 4 speed + low transmission.  Rear differential lock was optional til 1989,
then standard.  This is a REAL asset to getting unstuck or &quot;stuck&quot;
prevention.

Vanagon GL Syncro, 1986, 87, 89
7 passenger, GL &quot;nicities&quot; like front seat armrests, middle 2 passenger seat.
 Most have &quot;Weekender&quot; rear seat that folds out into a bed.

Vanagon Syncro, 1990, 91
7 passenger, pretty bare bones, removeable rear-facing seats behind the
driver &amp; front passenger seats.  Most have &quot;Weekender&quot; rear seat that folds
out into a bed.

Vanagon Camper Syncro, 1986, 87
6 passenger, fold up table, rear-facing seat behind the driver,  12VDC/120VAC
refrigerator,  Pop-top w/ sleeping loft for 2, &quot;Weekender&quot; rear seat that
folds out into a bed.  No sink or stove.

Vanagon GL Camper Syncro, 1986, 87, 89, 90, 91
4 passenger, 2 hide-away tables, 12VDC/120VAC/Propane refrigerator, sink,
stove, cupboards, Pop-top w/ sleeping loft for 2, &quot;Weekender&quot; rear seat that
folds out into a bed.

&gt;  I also wanna get info on h.p./torque, option packages, etc. or a place
&gt;  where I can get this info.
&gt;
&gt;  Last, once I get (if I get!) a decent example, are there CARB legal h.p.
&gt;  upgrades, suspension, brake upgrades etc.?  I have a feeling I'm SOL in
&gt;  terms of upgrades?  Please, no Chevy 454 conversions thank you.

Yes.  You're pretty much SOL for performance upgrades unless you replace the
engine.
