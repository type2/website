Subject: 82 westy rebuild - compression data 

     
     
     
     
     I had a leak down test done today, and here's the numbers.
     
     Since I can't recall which cylinder is which number (where's that 
     manual?) here's a visual, looking down:
     
     
     front
     -------
     
     18%  42%
     12%  43%
     -------
     rear
     
     These values were percent leakage as measured on the guage. Looked 
     like there was &gt;100 psi coming in.  It's interesting that the right 
     hand set were so much lower.  The PO said that the right hand heads 
     had been worked on - though he couldn't remember when.
     
     All the plugs were pretty clean, no gunk, except the one from the rear 
     right hand (is that #3) which had a white deposit on it.  I've put 
     5,000 miles on it since I got it.
     
     I saw some engines lying around and they seem fairly simple - so this 
     winter holds a rebuild for christmas - my girlfriend agreed to let me 
     use her garage... I'm sure I'll have to pay in kind ;).
     
     I'd like to drive from CO to MD for Thanksgiving.  Any opinions on how 
     that will affect the beauty ? (other than 'more wear').
     
     thanks
     
     john
