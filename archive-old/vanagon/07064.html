Subject: RE: Hot Tip Subaru Motor

Not MY hot tip, since every Subaru I've driven sounded like something caught
in the garbage disposal of the kitchen sink.  I have enough trouble explaining
to normal people why I put a Porsche engine in my van.  I'd hate to try ex-
plaining a Subaru.  Flame diffuser: I know you love your Subaru; it's just my
opinion.
