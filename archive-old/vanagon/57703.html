Subject: It's worse than I thought (fuel leak)
Date: Thu, 27 Mar 97 15:16:17 EST

Hey all,
Well the fuel leak I found on my '81 the other day is a bit worse than I
originally thought.  

Today I found that in addition to the leaking hose I have, one of the
plastic &quot;Y&quot; doohickeys on top of the tank that the vent hoses connect to
is very leaky.  I don't know if the plastic itself is cracked or if
there's a missing o-ring or what, but it's covered with gas.  I found
this out by looking in the wheel well -- I didn't see any gas on the
vent hose but looking at the lower part of the gas tank, I saw moisture,
smelled it and it was gas.  I then traced the source up to the Y
connector on top of the tank.  

The good thing is that it looks like it can be replaced without my
dropping the tank.  

Does anyone have any tips on doing this with the tank in the car?  Is
the plastic y still available for me to buy?

Any tips are appreciated

Sean
