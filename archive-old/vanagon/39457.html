Subject: vw suspension questoin

(this is for a guy that i work with who doesn't have e-mail) he is
working on a '67 vw type II transporter.  was wondering if you have any
info on front end steering/suspension.  what he is really looking for is
diagrams so that he can put all the parts back together so they work like
they are supposed to. (he is working with lack of funds--can't afford the
vw service manual)  any info would be greatly appreciated.  please e-mail
me at work  appout_at_aol_dot_com or amr148_at_psu_dot_edu.

thanks

dave
