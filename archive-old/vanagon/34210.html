Subject: Wanted: Rear Screen for Hatch

Well....Since David already promised the Rear Screen that Snaps in the Back
of the bus I am still in search of one.

I need one that will fit a 76 Westy(I think they are all pretty close as
long as the year is close).

If anyone has an extra they are looking to sell please let me know.

Thanks for the help.

Joe

76' Westy
