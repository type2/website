        Alrighty then, I have now expanded my knowledge to include the in
and outs of these little critters. Dad took me out and showed me whats
what, but now I just need to know one thing, where do I get them. Is this
one of those things that I can get at Canadian Tire or any store or am I
going to have to order them from a VW dealer?

        PS. I bought those MIchelin Kevlars and they seem fine. Nice smooth
ride.
