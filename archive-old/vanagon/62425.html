Subject: European stickers

Mike Radtke and Rick Goeln corresponded:

That's what I assumed since lanes were marked with speeds in some 
locations. Except:

1) Some trucks have 2 such stickers with different values.
Sometimes different colors, sometimes not.


2) The only cars that I noticed them on had much higher top speeds
than indicated. Such as a VW Polo with an 80. Perhaps a joke?


The learner standard that I've seen in many countries (including Spain and 
Portugal) is a big L. There were many time when I wished that I had one on 
my car!


Any further thoughts?


Thanks,
Mike

Hi Mike,
in some southern countries like Spain and Portugal you can register a Polo or 
a Golf as a light-truck to save taxes. (Sometimes these versions have 
sheet-metal instead of rear side windows). To make it not too attractive they 
put the 80km speed limit on these light trucks. You will see it on the Nissan 
and Toyota Pick-Ups which are very popular in Portugal as well.

When we traveled through Portugal we felt nobody bothered about the stickers 
or the speed limits because all those &quot;trucks&quot; kept passing our syncro Camper 
which did at least 120 km.

The different signs on heavy trucks mean the limit on roads respectivly on 
highways. Speed limit depends on the total weight and on the country where you 
drive. Also the eastern countries use to mark up their trucks with speed-limit 
stickers.

Complicated Europe ..

Bye Tom N.
