Subject: Re: Vanagon Floor Mats - description

&gt; the passenger mat, that aren't neccessary in a Vanagon.  I get the feeling 
&gt; that the mat is probably cut from a template that is meant for several 
&gt; vans, not just the VW, but nonetheless I was surprised how well it fits 
&gt; around the wheelwell arches (unlike the generic Pep Boys mats I have in my 
&gt; '85.)   Hopefully, one of the three listmembers who receives them can give 
&gt; us a report after actually using them.

I have these mats in the '81, came with it, wear well, are 
essentially &quot;lady bug&quot; mats for vanagon, do not trap as much water as 
say a weather tech mat (incredible do they come for van, loved them 
in the corrado) but are certainly custom fit exactly for the Vanagon 
not for anything else, why they are identical and leave gaps on the 
outer forward edges annoys me but they are still very nice, though 
pricey from parts place.
