Subject: Re: ignition wires

I just put new wires on my '81 Westie, and I bought the Bosch wires because
at $22 or so mail order they were cheaper then the ones from my local NAPA
at $36.

&gt;Does anyone know if there are any good reasons which could justify buying the
&gt;Bosch ignition wires.  If not, I would appreciate any suggestions you might
&gt;have concerning inexpensive wires which will fit a 1981 Vanagon Westy.
