Subject: Re: Adjusting Valves

A. Burczyk's note implies that TDC is 180 degrees from the bump on the cam;
I don't think that's true.  If you set your valves at TDC for each cylinder
you actually have a relatively small safety zone between the falling ramp
of one lobe and the rising ramp of the other.

Doesn't Muir tell how to do it in just two moves, using TDC for the &quot;wrong&quot;
cylinders so that as Burczyk implies you can use the 270 degrees that are
equiradial?  We need a designated Muir disciple who can relay the gospel to
us at any time of day.
