Subject: Insurance Companies Rated by Consumer Reports

Automobile Insurance Companies

Following are the ratings of auto insurance companies by Consumer Reports, a
publication of Consumers Union, a non-profit organization.  Consumer Reports
accepts no advertising or monies, gratuities, favors, etc. for any of the
products or services it evaluates and compares.  You'll save lots of money
and make smarter purchasing choices over the next year if you'll subscribe.
I subscribe because it gives me lots of comparative information on products
and services and I don't like being suckered.  A subscription costs $24/year.

Boulder CO  80323-1166

These ratings are based on responses to Consumer Union's 1994 Annual
Questionnaire.  Almost 34,000 readers participated in the survey.  Buy the
October 1995 issue of CR for more details.  They also evaluate car batteries
and portable heaters in this issue, among many other items.
