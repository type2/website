Subject: stiff captains chairs.

Hi,

Missed the original question, but maybe my experience relates.
Both of my captains chairs were 'stuck' when i first got the van, so I
took both chairs out, and noticed that the 4 bolts that hold down the
swivel thing were to tight.  I took the bolts out completely and removed
the swivel base, cleaned some gunk out, and put the bolts back in..to
tight, no swivel...loosened 'em some more..and I had swivel!

these vans are soooo cool!

woo wooo!
