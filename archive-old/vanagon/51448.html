&gt;When I get 5 messages in one day inquiring about the next CCC's outing, I
&gt;guess it's time to start organizing something.  A few of you have proposed
&gt;the first weekend in January for our next meet, as this is the anniversary
&gt;of the first time we ever did this sort of thing.  That was at Big Sur, which
&gt;might otherwise be a likely spot, but many have expressed disappointment that
&gt;there are too many rules and regulations there for the likes of our group,
&gt;and that perhaps another location would be better.
&gt;
&gt;Does the date seem OK for most of you?

Actually, something a little later would be best for me.  Probably like a
lot of other people, I'll be travelling during the Yule/New Year's season,
and I'll probably be travelled out during the first weekend of January.
How about the third weekend?

Also, I vote for someplace cold, since I want to try out my new heater :-)
