&gt;&gt;Reading some of the posts, I get the idea the people go mudslinging in the
&gt;&gt;syncros.  Is a syncros a real 4X4 kind of vehicle, like the toyata 4wd pu I
&gt;&gt;had?  I thought it was 4wd in the same sense as my dad's subaru legacy is a
&gt;&gt;4wd, i.e. better on road traction, no jumping logs and boulders.
&gt;&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;
&gt;In most situations the Syncro's off-road capability lies between the two.
&gt; Much closer to the 4x4 truck capability than the Legacy's.  In some
&gt;situations, the Syncro makes a more capable off-roader than the Toyota 4x4
&gt;you mention.

Hello everyone!
     The Syncro has ample ground clearence.   Its limiting factors are,
front and rear over hang, only 95 hp and exposed exhaust system.  I have
driven my Syncro off road alot.  It has better traction ability than my '90
S-10 blazer.  I have crawled over rocks and logs, through deep mud, forded
shallow streams, climbed steep grades and buried  it up to the frame in mud.

If you can't dazzle them with brilliance,
baffle them with bull sh*t.
