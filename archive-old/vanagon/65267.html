Subject:      Eurovan Update

The Eurovan Update is a print publication that comes out maybe every
other month or so.  I think the annual subscription is around 20 bucks
+ or - .  It seems to me that it has been around for about 2 or 3
years.  Some of the articles in the past have dealt with horns that
don't honk (and a nifty little shield you can build for them), tire
wear (and rear end alignment, etc.), air conditioning woes and
preventative measures, sliding door seals, and just about anything
else that goes wrong with the little darlings.  Some of the articles
are written by the publisher/editor and many are written by the
readers who write in. It is on an 8 1/2 X 11 format and is usually
around 10 or 12 pages or so.  The address is: HP Products, 6330 Waid
Circle, Paducah, KY 42001.  I have found it to be of great value and,
for me, well worth the 20 or so bucks.  I have taken an article to the
dealer and it gives me some background knowledge and I guess a little
ammunition.
