Subject: Re: Roof rack?  BRIGHT colors?

&gt;What I'm looking for is a roof-rack (it's not a pop-top) for
&gt;it, to handle the canoes, the kid, etc.  Anybody got one
&gt;they want to sell?

You could make one capable of anything.  I did. Check out The Bozobus at
http://techie.phys.sfu_dot_ca/Volkswagen/jgladu.html...
1cm aluminum plates for supports, warehouse shelf channeling for rails,
treated 3/4&quot; plywood for decking, with three fitted, treated 2x6
cross-beams.

&gt;Also, a call for opinions.  This group seems to always have
&gt;plenty ;)  so I figured this is a good source.  I want to
&gt;repaint the 68, top to bottom.  Right now it's a pretty dull
&gt;white.  I'm thinking about painting each below-window body
&gt;panel a different primary color.  The roof, posts, etc. would
&gt;be white again.  The rest of it would be, bright, shall we say.

Sounds good to me B^)
The Bozobus had something like that long ago, as I was regularly visiting
the Wahlberg-McReary dumpster in our area (FLAPS supplier).  Every time
they threw out a case of touch-up paint, I'd use the good ones to paint
another panel...

You could also mimic the local transit company's bus paint scheme
(something that I'm seriously considering as Mr. Bozo's next coat of
paint).  The Houston buses say &quot;METRO&quot; - I'll make mine say &quot;MICRO&quot;.
