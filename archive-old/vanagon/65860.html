Subject:      Oct 3rd,Augusta to seattle, confirmed!

Hey folks...

A few possibilities came togethor, and its confirmed...Me, and 3 friends
are driving the bus, and a ryder truck (with a flatbed with a camaro on
it) to Seattle, from augusta!! Truck is paid for, ect ect..

We'll be leaving Friday the 3rd, in the morning...

But....our hoped for return trip isnt completely paid for, since travis
used the last of his money paying me for the time i'm missing at
work...(hey, i got bills to pay, ya know!!)

Anyway, if any of you need anything delivered from the southeast, we'll
see what we can do, for a reasonable charge..

Rough plan:

Leave, Fri, 3rd
Get to KC on sunday, crash with dad.

Leave monday,I-29 to I 80, to I 84, to I 82, to I 90....

hopefully make it to seattle by thursday or friday...

Leave seattle mondayish, headed down the coast, towards San Diego....from
there, kinda sorta follow 8, 10, 20, home...

Nothing is set in stone yet, (except that we're going...:)
and we'd love to meet a few folks along the way..
 (oh, we lose the truck and camaro in Seattle...)

Also looking for weather reports along the route, and closed roads,
etc...Mountains and all that, you know?

It for now, gotta finish my shed, and start on my brakes...


....david
