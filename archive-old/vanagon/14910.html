Peoples,

It looks like we have about 26 people on the East coast that have
expressed interest in the GNATT trip, and about 42 from the rest of the
country.  As we speak, I am busy trying to pawn off the organization of
the Eastern leg to someone.

I posted about reversing the path of the Western leg, and got several
enthusiastic responses, and almost no negative ones.  Therefore, unless
a bunch of people tell me, like REAL soon, that they can't make it, I
am going to rework the route to start from St. Louis on May 26th.  This
is the time and location of the Busses by the Arch gettogether, which for
a lot of us is a big plus!  We will stay the weekend at St. Louis for
BBTA and then head out West, veering up into Canada, over to Victoria,
and then down the West coast.  We should arrive in Central California
sometime during the 3rd week in June, or thereabouts.  Those that can't
make it to St. Louis, I hope will still plan on joining one of the legs
of the trip for a while.

Hopefully, the Eastern leg will find it's way to St. Louis during the
weekend of May 26-28 also.  I called Bill Baumann, who is organizing
the event, and he is out of town till Thursday evening.  I intend to
tell him that there will be a group of us there!  Entrance is supposed
to be $20/day, which includes a camp site.

Hope to see a bunch of you there!

-David
