Subject: Re: oil how to cool it?

I have an 82 vanagon with a VDO oil guage attached to the sump and the
temps are running in the 250s recently. Is there anything I should look
into to get the temps down. It has just recentyly gotten this hot? I
installed a new thermostat last fall, so I know its not that. It has an
oil cooler and the engine has around 4000 miles on it (GEX rebuild). 
Should I install an external oil cooler, the ones I see on the sides of
many VWs? Also the muffler is rusted out, could that have anything to do
with the heat? Please help
