(for rick)

you do have dual circuits as does everyone in the US post 1966 if i remember
right.

Impt. thing here is not to let light run your life - i realise the beast
is new but if it stopping okay then you probably have either an electrical
problem or a 'minor' internal leak in the brake master cylinder.

You might want to check the brake lights for normal operation - if things are
funny here this points to electrical problems tho' not definitively.

A 'minor' leak in the mc is a contradiction of terms, some would argue -
if you cant find any leaks at wheels (i would pull drums to check back as
a very small leak can give reported symptoms) then a new mc (&lt; $50) is in
order. worst part of this job is snapping an old bleeder off.

Welcome to the list !!!! and happy vanagonning!!
