&gt;My Dad actually found a '38 Caddy V-16 5-passenger Coupe in a junkyard in
&gt;Arkansas (about 20+ years ago).  Burned up in a barn fire before it could
&gt;be restored.  1 of 8 built.   That motor was about as big as the V6anagon.


...and you wouldn't have to worry about a clutch or tranny-- just open the
rear hatch and push the car with the fan.   :^)
