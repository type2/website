Subject: Re: Warm air from under the dash.

Hmm.  Before I replied to this, I should've read all the other
replies:

&gt; The heater control valve is probably stuck open... The control cable
&gt; can get bent and then it will never be able to close the valve all
&gt; the way.

&gt; I have to re-adjust the ends of the control cables... The travel
&gt; allowed by the control arm in the dash is not enough... to go from
&gt; fully opened to fully closed.

&gt; ... the heater controls... can be confusing for new owners.

&gt; ... there is some insulation to shield the heat from the rad.  fan -
&gt; possibly this has come loose...

&gt; ...the flow control valve for the front heater core is out of
&gt; adjustment...

&gt; On mine the cable for the heater valve needed to be adjusted.

What I'm getting from all this (and what you should too, Gordo) is
that it's a complex system with several points of failure.  My advice
to you is to go from the simplest to the most complex fixes one-by-one
until you finally get to one that works.  You know, troubleshoot.

Before I was able to narrow the problem down to a defective valve, I
had to go through the following:

  - Went over and over the instructions for the (non-intuitive) dash
    heat/air vent/footwell/rear controls to make sure I was doing it
    right. 

  - Traced the control slider cables to see what they were actually
    controlling.

  - Checked that the temperature slider (the one that goes from a blue
    dot to a red dot) was actually moving the cable in its sheath, not
    just bending it somewhere.

  - Checked that where the cable attached to the valve, it was
    actually opening and closing the valve all the way when I moved
    the slider.

At each step of the way, I found and fixed little problems:
Reconnected an air hose that had popped loose of its mount.
Re-clamped the heater control cable sheathing where it had worked its
way out of the clamp.  But still the problem persisted.

Now, since I replaced the valve, everything's been hunky-dory.  But I
never would have started right off by replacing it -- too expensive,
too much work, too many easier and cheaper things were also broken.

What I take away from all this is, thank heavens I work on my own car!
No $60/hour mechanic would have gone through these steps as
thoroughly, and if he had, it would have cost me hundreds o bucks to
fix a cheesy stupid problem like, &quot;My heat won't turn off.&quot;

And if that is true, think how much more it applies to problems in
more complex systems of your car.  Learn it.  Do it yourself.  Be
happy.
