Subject: Re: exhaust for stock motor

&gt;&gt;exchangers on the stock exhaust are looking pretty attractive.
&gt;Also the price is low ($40 for the Brazilian kind).
&gt;
&gt;Also sealing the flanges to the heat boxes is a bitch, they're dented
&gt;and rusty.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for any input---

&gt;I'm about to get an exhaust for my 71 bus ...1600 stock
 If you want quiet...go stock...and spring for the German or the Brazilian
 I'm told the German lasts much longer and fits much better.

 My 2 cents....and the opinion of many others on the list.
