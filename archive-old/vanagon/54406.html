Subject: Re: weird problem w/ poor 85 Westy gas mileage

  With a mega-tune-up,
&gt;new belts, hoses, filters, gaskets, oil &amp; filter change, transmission
&gt;filter/fluid change, 0xygen sensor, coolant sensor etc. and I'm sure a
&gt;few other things I've forgotten, we got an average of 26 MPG.  We had to
&gt;watch this very closely because we had never driven it before this trip
&gt;and our gas gauge was broken.  Our camper has automatic trans and 207.000
&gt;miles on it!
.  So it can be done.  We get about 17 in stop &amp; go around Cape Cod.
&gt;The first trip was fully loaded for camping.  When I learned how to drive


26 mpg in a fully loaded Westy.  And a Auto no less... Maybe if you drove
downhill all the way (were you heading South?).  At this point the claims
are repealing the laws of physics.

This is MPG close to what my Corrado gets unloaded at a steady 65. A
Corrado, half the size of a Vanagon and with infintly better areodynamics.

I will now bow out of this thread permanently but with this last thought:

MPG discussions with Vanagons are like fish stories, and none of it should
ever be taken as accurate and used to judge the performance of any other
vehicle.

I don't mean to &quot;dis&quot; on anyone's beliefs, but this is just getting silly.
