Subject: Re: Type 2 Engine Mount

&gt;I successfully drilled and tapped bolt holes in a bug engine so that I
&gt;could mount it to the rear support...and I'm not even that good with a
&gt;drill. Magnesium is so soft to the drill that I'd bet a portable hand
&gt;drill would do the trick fine...it taps out nicely (easily). The only
&gt;tricky part is not to drill too deep; there's an oil passage just beyond
&gt;one of the places you'd need to drill...so my solution would be to carry
&gt;the right drillbit and tap, figuring I could borrow or buy a hand drill if
&gt;I needed to. Oh yeah, I used the rear support arm as a guide for drilling;
&gt;If I were to do it again, I'd probably install the engine first, get the
&gt;rear support lined up and then drill.

Joe,

The only drawback I see to this plan is that some bug cases don't have all
three bosses in the case at the 68-71 rear brace mounting points.  Aside
from universal cases which have the mount points already, I believe only the
'70-up cases have the proper bosses you can drill out.  I believe I've seen
a '67 bug case that had the bottom boss and possibly the passenger side one,
but the driver's side of the case would not accomodate the bus rear brace
bolt position.

&gt;I don't like the idea of adding stress at the oil pump. Just doesn't seem
&gt;natural.

It's just not the way God intended engine mounting to be!!  No one has
mentioned the possibility of bungee cords yet--with enough bungee cords a
man (or woman) could rule the world [Warning: this was a joke--don't try
ruling the world with bungee cords or securing an engine with them...]
