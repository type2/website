Subject: Re:  running rich on Digijet

Hey,

Well, I made it to Nashville in my '87 w/ 9.1 Digijet (don't ask - it
just is).  The trip went smoothly with my newly rebuilt motor except for
one thing:

The engine seems to be running rich (black sooty deposits in the
tailpipe and bad gas mileage (14 mpg _at_ 65 - 70 mph....15 mph if I nurse
it carefully _at_ 60 mph - I thought it should be around 18 mpg).  When I
let off the throttle it blows a puff of black smoke out the tailpipe. 
At the suggestion of my rebuilders I stopped in Las Cruces _at_ the local
VW dealer there and they adjusted the mixture screw on my throttle valve
to lean it out.  They revved it several times and this seemed to get rid
of the black smoke.  However, farther down the road the black cloud on
throttle rolloff came back.  My MPG seemed to increase slightly but the
tail pipe still showed the sooty black deposits.

Now.  The 1.9 when I bought it had the OXS sensor disconnected so the
rebuilders left it off explaining that it would run worse with it
connected.  I thought the OXS sensor told the injection computer if the
mixture was too lean or rich and would allow it to compensate thus
making it a good thing to have.  Is my supposition wrong and the
rebuilder's right?  Should I rehook the OXS sensor and if I do will I
have to do any adjusting?

All replies will have to be made to my sister's account above since I'm
2,000 miles from my computer for the time being.

TIA
