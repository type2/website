Subject:      WTB: Misc 86 Parts

Hi all,

I have a wish list for the following *used* parts for my 86 Vanagon Syncro
GL's:

ECU and bracket under rear seat
Good used metal rear bumper (2 needed)
Driver's side power mirror mirror (can remove via lever along side mirror
    glass)
Blue cloth middle seat (shipping to KC?)
Aero-style full hubcap (1)
Rear view mirror in good shape, brown or black (for my 82 diesel)
Good used rear door struts (for my 84, I'm too cheap to buy new for it)

Please respond (with reasonable prices) via email.  TIA,
---
