Subject: To the SCUM that stole my semaphores!!

(I know this is a Bug thing, but what the hell, I gotta get it outta my
system. Maybe others have had probs with rare parts getting ripped off too.
. .?)

As if my stuck solenoid on the '79 Bus wasn't bad enough, this morning as I
walk out to my restored '58 Bug, I noticed (with an icy, sick feeling in my
gut) two gaping holes, wires dangling out, where my precious, remanufactured
semaphores ($200) once rested with pride.  Oh, how they loved to pop out at
the flick of a switch, announcing to the world my turns. . .and turning all
SuperBeetle drivers green with envy.  But no more.

&lt;Sob&gt;  If, by some freakish twist of cruel fate, the subhuman refuse who
stole them happens to be lurking in this list (or on
rec.automakers.vw.aircooled), a pox upon thee and thy posterity!  If I ever
get a hold of your sorry, neanderthal, illegitimately-sired butt, I am going
to get SERIOUSLY medieval on you.

Steal my wallet, rape my woman, whatever, just DON'T mess with my Bug!! (Or
Bus.)

Fahrfengnugen, everyone.

P.S. Last month, someone stole the fuel cap off of my '79 Bus, so even
late-model Buses aren't immune.  (The #$_at_%! fuel cap?)
P.P.S.  Any suggestions as to how to protect semaphores from theft? Locking
devices, inscribed numbers, etc.?  Remember, old Buses got 'em too, I think.
Assuming I ever FIND replacements. . .
