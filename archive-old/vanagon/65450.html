&gt; HIGH ALTITUDE FRIDGE UPGRADE INSTALLED....
&gt;
&gt; Just picked up my 1995 eurobago with the upgrade.
&gt;
&gt; What was done:
&gt; -added extra vent by cutting another hole in side of van
&gt; -new burner
&gt; -you can now see the pilot light when looking at the bottom of
&gt; the fridge along the floor
&gt; -cost:  123.20 for the part
&gt; -labor covered under warrenty
&gt;
&gt; Result:
&gt; -i got there and it didn't work!  Thing wouldn't work
&gt; -fridge taken apart and reassembled then it worked (no problem found)
&gt; -i am sick and tired of dealing with this fridge
&gt;
&gt; More info:
&gt; It has taken about a month to get this work done.  Delay in parts due to UPS
&gt; and parts missing as well as the dealership not being aware of the problem.  I
&gt; told the service manager  i was disappointed that i was being charged for
&gt; anything and listed a bunch of prepared reasons (as gather from the list).
&gt; service manager did treat me in what a felt was a good manner even though he
&gt; Thestill charged me for some the amount.  3.5 hours of labour was covered.  He
&gt; said they are treating the upgrade like they would if you were buying the van
&gt; new from the factory.  Basically, it is the cost of the factory option which
&gt; is the cost of the part.
&gt;
&gt; Advice:
&gt; If you want to upgrade....get a bucket and some ice.  I was hoping that the
&gt; fridge upgrade would make it more reliable.  I think as norcold fridge owers
&gt; we need to work as a group and look for a recall.  Not extended warrenty, but
&gt; recall.  I think it is simply a crap shoot whether the fridge is going to
&gt; light.   One might want to wait and see how my fridge does before upgrading
&gt; their fridge.
&gt;
&gt; Thank-you for the support and information on dealing this this problem.

A fine tradition continues....these fridges never did work well and it
looks like nothing has changed, except the cost.
