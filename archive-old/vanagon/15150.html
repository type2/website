&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I *did* notice that resistance across the throttle valve switch terminals was
&gt;&gt;open-circuit at the idle stop.  According to Bentley (24.35) this should be
&gt;&gt;zero ohms.  I measured zero ohms at the full-throttle stop, but not at the
&gt;&gt;idle stop.  Is it possible that I neglected something in making the measurement
&gt;&gt;or is this a real live data point?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The only other abnormal thing I noticed was that the tube leading from the oil
&gt;&gt;breather to the air cleaner was both collapsed upon itself and ruptured.  I
&gt;&gt;can't figure how this enters into the problem but thought I'd mention it....

You need to adjust the throttle switch so that it is closed when the pedal
is let go completely. It probably has nothing to do with your current problem
but is a simple adjustment anyway. The switch, when closed, will cut off
fuel injection if the engine RPM is higher than about 1500 RPM. WHen the RPM
is dropped down the FI resumes. I am sure everyone experienced that on warm days 
on starting up. The engine  revs up and suddenly it stops, kind of get choked,
and when it slows down the engine will rev up again and repeats. This is a
smog feature of the vanagon engine.

The breather tube you are talking about is critical to the engine to maintain
proper idle. Mine once cracked and I yanked the one from my 83 westy to see
the effect between a good and a bad one. Yes, the bad one made the engine 
idle poorly.
