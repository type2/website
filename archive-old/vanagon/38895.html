Subject: WOW!  Miracle MPG improvement

First we have the scheduled appearance of the Virgin Mary in a hay field in Middle 
River,  MN (about as far from anywhere as can be) and now --&gt;

my '87 Westy finally broke the 20 mpg barrier!

previous to my recent head work, i've approached 20 mpg but never 
actually hit it.  19.8 was the highest i've seen, and that was on a 
*long* trip.  the last two tankfuls, which are the first two since 
the engine work, have seen  20.3 and 21.2 mpg on open road trips of over 
200 miles each.

ever diligent to explain unexplainable phenomenon, i *think* the 
difference is attributable to:
	1.  a new thermostat that replaced one that obviously ran cooler
	2.  decarbonizing and lapping-in of the intake valves
or maybe
	3.  Joel sneaking over to my house at night and adding a bit of gas 
to my tank.

as my grandmother used to say, &quot;I'm tickled pink&quot;
