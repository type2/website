Subject: 64- 67 Westy Interior Lighting question

Anyone know how the lights that are situated between the louvered windows on the drivers side of a 
Westy are wired?? Are they wired directly to the battery??

If anyone wants to see my very _cursory_ stab at putting up some pictures of a few busses I have 
found check out

Apologies on scanner quality and of abiltity to jpeg's to translate from tiif's. Any thoughts on how to 
remove that annoying white line from the side of the pic??
