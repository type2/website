 Anyone see any reason why a Syncro couldn't be hauled in the older style
 sling type tow truck, front up high, wheels spinning freely in the breeze,
 driven by the viscous coupling?  Just a thought for those little
 emergencies.  tim

 This should be okay for short distances.  Be advised that this type of pick
up will damaage the front bumper and it does put undue strain on the front
end where the lift chains are attached.
