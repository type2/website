Subject: Help, please. (no VW content at all)

If you've gotten this far, I hope you know that what follows contains no VW
content at all. If not, consider yourself told and delete of you wish.

If you are still with me, thank you. I am a one-time and once-again
subscriber to this list. I have been gone for about a year, and I am really
glad to be back and see all the familiar names again. I see that the GNATT
was a success and has spawned another summer trip--good news. Not that I
would even _consider_ asking my dear Mabel to take me to the top of the
world on what looks like a semi-paved journey, but I'm glad to see the list
is still alive, and more active than ever.

Enough waxing nostalgic. Here's why I am writing:

1. I am working on a magazine article about how e-mail and other
computer-mediated forms of communication effect relationships (usually ones
that depend on these forms of communication due to distance, but not only
those). I need to get in touch with people who have had experience with this
sort of thing, and I knew that the vanagon list would be friendly to my
search. So, if you have ever had a relationship based on communicating
through computers or have ever noticed computer-mediated communication
having an effect (positive or negative) on a relationship you have with
someone, I would love to ask you a few questions. E-mail me if you would be
willing to e-talk about it, e-please.

2. I am going to relocate to Nashua, New Hampshire for the summer to work at
a magazine there, and I need to find a place to live. If anyone reading this
has any leads on furnished summer housing of any kind in the immediate area,
please let me know. Even if you could just tell me the name of a newspaper
in Nashua so I could call them and ask for a copy of the classifieds or
something, I would be grateful for your help.

Thank you for bearing with me through all this absolutely non-VW stuff. I
know it's a pain to wade through junk like this, but this was the only list
I knew would be kind and helpful to my cause. TIA for your help.

1988 Subaru XT (I know, I know, not even the right continent, but they know
a                   good engine configuration when they see one. It even
sounds a                   little like a VW if you squint...Her name is
Sheila, I think)
