&gt;&gt; I could not find a floormat for the back that I liked, so I went to a
&gt;&gt; hardware/home improvement store that had a sale on small carpets,
&gt;&gt; bought a 5' wide carpet for $20.00 .  It was real easy to cut with a 
sharp
&gt;&gt; knife.  For extra protection from the kids, I placed a layer of nylon
&gt;&gt; (heavy duty garbage bags) underneath it, cut out the holes where the
&gt;&gt; heater is and where the seat mounts are.
&gt;
&gt;Someone on this list about a year ago also cut their own carpets and
&gt;had the great idea to go to a carpet store and have them stitch
&gt;all the way around the outside.  This made it look professional
&gt;and cost almost nothing.


I've been doing this for years (and so, I suspect, have been MANY
old-bus owners). It's made easier by the fact that the bus floor
is perfectly flat, perfectly rectangular, and with a nice hidden space
under the rear seat to ack carpeting down so it doesn't slide around.

Putting two thicknesses of 1/2&quot; carpet padding (the super-dense,
multicolored kind, available at any carpet store or large hardware
store), makes it very nice to sit/kneel/whatever on.

Plus, you get your choice of colors, textures, etc! And it's a fair
soundproofer.

Try it, you'll like it!
