&gt;What would be the effect on performance if the regular air filter in a 73
&gt;Westy was supplemented by an additional  &quot;medium sized bird nest including
&gt;a few baked feathers&quot; filter, underneath the pleated paper filter.
&gt;
&gt;Was this a factory option, or was it more likely to have been installed by
&gt;the dealer?   Can I still get parts (twigs, wool) or will I have to replace
&gt;the entire &quot;bird nest&quot; as an assembly?


It was installed by your VW dealer.  The &quot;bird nest&quot; is part of the
California emissions equipment.  You must have this part on the car
(working or not) in order to pass the Calif smog check.

Since you're not in Calif, I'd just remove it.
