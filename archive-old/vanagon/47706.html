Subject: Hydrolic valve adjustment?

Having replaced a broken rocker arm stud on my 1980 2. litre I proceeded to
adjust the valves. I tightened them to take out all play plus two full turns
of the the adjustment screw, but this was too tight, I lost compression in
cylinders. Then I redid it leaving the little play I felt in the Hydrolic
tappets, but leaving no gap between the adjustment screw and the valve stem.
Now they seem too loose.
   1. Should I be feeling a little play in the tappets at all?
    2. If so should I adjust it out?
     3. Should I do the operation hot or cold?
       
Any help you could give would be most appreciated. Thanks,
