Citizens:

This is an extremely belated thanks to all of those who responded to my 
questions concerning air compressors 
[deleted]
I'm getting the Compresssor from Sam's Club, a six HP 60-gallon jobbie.

Chris Chubb:

Last weekend at Home Depot they were running a special on a 6 HP 
30-gallon 2-cylinder belt-drive portable for only $327!  The only problem 
with the less powerful ones is that the tank is smaller.  Several members 
suggested bigger tanks are always better because they don't require the 
engine to run as much.

Anyway, thanks again everybody!

======================

The lesson I may have finally learned is in two parts:

1)  There probably is only one thing more frustrating that not having the
right tool for the job -- and that is having the correct but too
small/inadequate/underpowered version capacity of that tool for the job.

2)  Unless you ABSOLUTELY know you will use a tool only once and then throw it
away, or intend to modify it for some uniques application from a standard
tool,    buy the very best quality tool you can absolutely afford, use it
properly in all respects (including safety), take care of/maintain it
properly, and it will last you a lifetime.  In the case of a &quot;system&quot;  always
try to budget to buy a size/capacity that will allow for growth, for example
an air compressor - size it, if you can afford to ( or delay purchase until
you can afford to) to meet current identified need as well as some margin for
future (possibly) unidentified needs.
