Subject: Re: Help on buying '87 Westy

Well... after considering all your much appreciated advice, I think I 
may go for it. The dealer has offered to let me have the van for a 
day so I can check it over more thoroughly. 
He has stated that they will not accept below 12,500, but will offer 
90 days powertain warranty, and 90 days no payments.
(the no GST was on new cars only...)
If everything checks out, I can live with this price, I guess. I 
think the dealer has sensed that I like this van (my mistake), so 
they will probably hold their ground (and my wife does not have a
good poker face either...)

I plan to check for all the things mentioned by the list members, 
especially the gas stove/fridge which I haven't looked at yet, and 
see if the oil press. problem goes away with a VW filter.
Also will do a compression test to confirm the readings 
(125-130-125-125), and check over the body further.

If it checks out, I may try 'the take 12000 or I walk' deal...

I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
