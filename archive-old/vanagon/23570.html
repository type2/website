Howdy,

With all of this talk about electrical loads on the alternator
etc. I was wondering about some of the people who put solar 
panels on the roof of their Westys.  How many amps can these 
produce at 12V (assuming a reasonably sized array on top of the 
bus)?  How much of the load do these help to offset and what
are people powering with these arrays?  Obviously it doesn't
help in the case of a light at night, but what about daytime
loads such as ac or &quot;camping accessories&quot;?  The alternator in
my '79 bus was never able to sustain the ac at idle even when
the ac did work (I don't use it anymore to save the engine
and alternator wear) so the mechanical energy used to produce
the electricity in the alternator was definitely substantial.
How about w/ solar panels?
