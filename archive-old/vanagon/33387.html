&gt; what is you opinion on adjusting the spring tension inside of the
&gt; air flow meter. i've been experimenting and have noticed that on
&gt; a air flow meter that wouldn't respond to CO (mixture) adjustment
&gt; tightening the spring tension allows the CO adjustment to become
&gt; possible. the spring tension can be tightened or loosened and
&gt; is indexed by a plastic gear which is held in place by a spring.
&gt; i figured you may be familiar with this.
&gt; i have done this in the past with an old BMW 5 series that was not
&gt; responding to adjustment. in this case it seemed to help alot.
&gt;
&gt; i think that so far, i was able to get the 2.1 wasserboxer to
&gt; be within specs, only after tightening the spring tension inside
&gt; the air flow meter by three clicks. CO about 1.00-.095 %
&gt; and HC around 200 ppm. i noticed that i encountered slow speed
&gt; surging. while traveling in gear 1,2 or 3rd without giving any gas
&gt; at slow speeds. after richening the mixture a little bit, it is a little
&gt; better, but it still exists. i am sure the throttle switches
&gt; are properly adjusted. could the be a result of changing the spring tension
&gt; inside of the air flow meter? also i find that trying to get the 2.1 to
&gt; run within spec is a time consuming process and i find myself 
&gt; having the think hooked up to the exhaust analyzer for hours at a time.
&gt; any ideas?
&gt; i have seen some info on the largest version of the 2.1 that was offered in
&gt; germany and it was a 2.1 with 10.1 compression and running digijet
&gt; injection, no lamda and no catalyst. i'm sure that that setup
&gt; really would run very smooth at idle and it could be tuned to pass
&gt; the MD emmisions. my 2.1 with digifant is nice and runs good, but
&gt; i just wish i could get it to run a bit smoother at idle, but
&gt; i seem to feel that these engines especially with the newer fi setup
&gt; run rough.
&gt; by the way the engine i have in my crewcab is the one i bought
&gt; from joe gunyan, i think you may know him.
&gt; later,

Hello Patrick.
I most definately know Joe and I know of the crew cab that you own.  I was
interested in buying it.  At the time it was available,  I was already
commiting to purchase Lucy.  Lucy is a 1923 Haynes, model 57 open touring
car.

As for adjusting the air flow meter, &quot;KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF&quot;.  Put it back
where it was.  The whole purpose of the Lamba system is to continuously
adjust the mixture to keep it ont the money.  A mixture too rich will cause
the Cat to be over worked, ineffecient at reducing CO, and overheated.  I've
seen the CATs burn paint off the rear Valance.  A mixture that is too lean
will cause engine miss, which will also overheat the Cat, and increase the
production of Oxides of Nitrogen, a mojor component of smog.  Assuming your
FI and Lamda circuit is working properly,  you must have the airflow meter
way out of adjustment if you can now adjust the CO without the system
re-correcting it.  When adjusting,(actually testing),  the mixture should be
measured before the Cat.  If your Van is running correctly,  you should have
near zero CO and Hydrocarbons after the Cat, with it warmed up and ignited.
 It is normal for your engine to miss slightly at idle, however. 200PPM
hydrocarbons is excessive.  In NY, you fail at 220PPM and 1.2%CO.  The file
will describe what the test results mean.

I've attached a file of an article I've done on Emissions controls.  It is in
Word 7.0.  If needed I can send it to you as a text file. It describes how
most of FI system works.  At least the emissions part.
Feel free to E-Mail me again if I can be of any further help.  Hope your
enjoying that crew cab.  If oyu need to call, I can be reached at
516-563-8248.  I'm usually home after 7:00pm.
Keep on Bussin, 
Dennis.
