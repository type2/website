Subject: .Re: new engine for '66, some questions

Hello, Dyer --

&gt;Also, this bus has an after-market air conditioning unit on it.  Against
&gt;conventional wisdom, I'm thinking of using it.  Does anyone have any
&gt;information about how many horse-power a modern air-conditioning &gt;compressor
uses?  I've heard 3-5 HP and that doesn't sound too bad.

3 to 5 HP isn't bad unless those are the 3 to 5 HP that you need to maintain
speed or accelerate -- which they will likely be part of the time.

Still, if I was living near Tucson, I would try the AC, if it didn't fry the
engine to use it.  However, if I had to drive up Kit Peak or some other
multithousand-foot mountain to work every day, I would be real careful when
the AC was on.  

I took the aftermarket AC off a 70 Ghia I once had.  I didn't like the
installation.  Had bad experiences with 6 volt AC on a 65 squareback we owned
(new) back then --  6 volt electrics and AC didn't work very well in my
experience.  Even the VW dealer who installed the system couldn't make it
work for more than a few days at a time.

Guess my suggestion is not to spend much to make the AC work unless you are
desperate, or until you go to 12 volts, or both.  When &quot;both&quot; applies, get a
new efficient compresser, etc. 

&gt;I am also wrestling with 6 volt to 12 volt conversion question.  I'm
thinking
&gt;of leaving it 6 volt for now and changing later.  I know I'll have to drop
&gt;the engine when I finally do convert so I can change the flywheel.  Anyone
&gt;have any information on the bottom line cost of doing the 6 to 12 volt
&gt;conversion?  Also, does the transmission bell housing have to be &gt;clearanced

If you leave it 6v, you won't have to replace the AC compressor's clutch,
which is likely to be a 6v one.  Cost?  about $100 for the alternator kit
(minimum) plus another $100 or so for the flywheel.  Try to find a good used
one and have it refaced for $25 or so.  The &quot;rebuilt&quot; ones are often in worse
shape than you can find in junkyards (though they are cleaner).  ( I don't
think late 6volt engines' cranks are any different from the 12 volt ones.  As
I recall, the early 6v flywheels and cranks used a different seal and shim
arrangement. )  Then new clutch and pressure plate?  And replace the AC
compressor or at least the clutch.  The bell housing may have to be
clearanced, but that can be done cheaply and easily.
