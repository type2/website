Subject: Vanagon Alternator Wires

Hello,

Perhaps someone can tell me why there are two wires going from the
alternator to the starter (and main battery) instead of one FAT one?  As
far as the wiring diagram shows, they come from the same place and go to
the same place.  Is it for redundancy or leftovers from an older stock
system?  Would a larger gauge wire affect current flow or something like
that?

Thanks,

Noel Leavitt
