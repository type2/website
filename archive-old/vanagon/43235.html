Subject: Greetings from Diesel Westfalia owner

Greetings list participants,
  I just subscribed last night so getting up to speed on some threads may 
take me a few notes.  First let me say that my totally rust free 
Diesel Westfalia is currently in Orlando Fla, where few cars rust.  
That doesn't describe all Florida, and in another post I may describe to 
those interested in buying a totally rust free used Westy, the relevant 
factors and how they're distributed.  I am a genuine diesel fan, and 
specifically searched for a diesel powered unit.  Still, in the three 
days that I've now actually over-nighted in it, most of my questions are 
unrelated to diesel specific issues.
  First, while it's refrigerator cools in the 120 VAC and propane modes 
that I've tried, I hear a small blower fan intermittantly cycling on 
and off with disquiting regularity.  It occurs to me that I failed to 
record the periodicity, but I'd guess it's on for 15 seconds, then off 
for 30 seconds, continuously without regard to which heat source is 
powering the ammonia/water generator.  I'm well familiar with the 
ammonia/water cooling cycle, and aware of the benefits of increasing air 
flow over that heat exchanger, but every other RV absorbtion refrigerator 
I've encountered is designed to generate adequate air flow by including 
an adequate chimney height to allow the ideal gas laws to do their 
wonders without noise or distractingly noisy, battery draining 
thermostatically controlled fans.  This is unacceptable to me.  Comments?
  I've other questions, but to enable responses to address specific 
questions by topic threads well, I'll submit them individually.
  Thanks ahead for any help and insights.  I like other participants 
bring something to the party, and in my case you may enjoy a very unusual 
universe of thought and experience.
	Respectfully,
	John Wakefield
