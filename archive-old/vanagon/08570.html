&gt; 
&gt; Was _anybody_ able to properly view the ASCII file I posted yesterday?
&gt; I tried it on my PC, and it does work, although I had to edit a couple
&gt; of lines out to keep it from setting my terminal to 40 column mode.
&gt; (edit out the very first and last lines, and there is one in the middle
&gt; but ya gotta know how to find it)
&gt; 
&gt; On a VT100, VT220 or ansi terminal, it works perfectly!

Worked OK on my Xterm display. Though it would be nice if I could
have slowed it down. (Probably the only time I'll ever wish for a slower
machine.)

&gt; At least the complaints here were not as bad as on the Posche list - I
&gt; got a zillion flames cause the wannabe techno-weenies with their AOL
&gt; accounts couldn't figure it out!

Say hi to Stan for me. When I was on the Porsche list (86 944 turbo),
I was the only Rodeilander (one word when you say that) on it.

Sadly, there is also only 1 rodeilander on the vanagon list. (Joel, how
about subclassifying me as RI.Newport? :-)
