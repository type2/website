Subject: broke a nut on trans. mount (help)

Hi all.

While removing my transmission ('85 4-speed), I broke off one of the nuts
that's welded inside the frame.  This is the frontmost trans. mount with
four bolts holding a flat plate against the frame.  There are four more
holes offset about an inch to one side.  Are these just in case of what
happened - and can I use them instead?

Seems strange that there would be two sets of holes just for that reason,
but who am I to argue with German engineering?

Thanks ahead. . .
