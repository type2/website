Subject: Re: vanagon turbo-diesel

&gt; How much power/torque are the turbo-diesel engines rated at?

There are several versions of the vw inline 4 cyl diesel engine,
where the block is a direct bolt up replacement for the original 
diesel. The turbo versions range from 68 hp in the early 80ies
1.6 l diesel to 110 hp in the new (Europe only so far) 1.9 l TDI.

The problem is that although the block bolts up right to the
same bell housing and motor mounts, there is no guarantee that
the extra &quot;accessories&quot; fit (turbo, rearranged exhaust, intake
etc.). Also the 1.9 blocks is a little higher (just 17mm I think), 
which means valve cover and injection pump will stick up slightly
higher, but there is room for that in the vanagon.

Particularly interesting candidates, because they are availible
in north american VW's are:

1.9 TDI:		(Golf,Jetta,Passat US and Canadian models)
Type                    Direct-injected, intercooled turbo diesel
Displacement            1896cc
Bore/Stroke             79.5x95.5mm
Output:                 90bhp(66kW)_at_4000rpm
Max. Torque:            149lb-ft(202Nm)_at_1900rpm

1.9 IDI
Type                    Indirect injection diesel

Golf Jetta implementation (Canada)
Output:                 75 PS_at_ 4,200 RPM
Max. Torque:            150 Nm (110 lb-ft) _at_ 2,400 RPM

1.6 TD			(Old (80:ies) US/Can Golf,Jetta Passat)
Type                    Indirect injection turbo diesel
Output:                 68 PS at 4000 some RPM (Out of my head)
Max. Torque:            ??

Europeean car had a Golf 1.6-&gt;1.9 swap article some time ago. I posted
an excerpt from that one this spring. Should be availible in the
archives.
