Subject: Clicking from rear axle and CV wear
Date: Fri, 10 Jan 1997 21:26:59 -0000

I had a click-click-click from the rear axle when turning right, so I had
the left hand inner CV joint replaced. The left had done 60,000 miles and
the right had done 16,000. Both sides had new 60,000 miles ago. However a
clicking is still there.

0. Can I console myself that the two sides needed balancing anyway?
1. The outer CV joints may well have done the full 183,000 miles. Could
(one of) these be the culprit(s)?
2. How do the outer and inner joints compare in terms of relative
longevity?
3. The right hand side had a CV joint that only lasted 44,000 miles - isn't
this very poor performance? Could there be something that is causing the
right hand side to go wrong?
4. Is there any other possibility for the clicking (once per wheel
revolution)?
