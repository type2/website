Subject: Fuel Filler Sizes (gripe)

On the subject of fuel filler nozzles, my local (and regular)
gas station hasjust changed thier pumps to fufill Virginias
new fuel vapor legislation. They replaces the hoses with some type
of big, clunky nozzle with some type of plastic barrier around the
pipe.This works fine on cars with unleaded-only filler holes. But
my '71 does not have said restriction, you could prob. get a tennis
ball down the tube with some shoving. 

So, to use these 'better' nozzles, I have to lean (hard) on the nozzle, 
just to get the tip of it to extend far enough to aim into my tank.
With a 16 gallon tank, and the anemic pumps, I have to lean on it for 4.5
minutes. This is tiring, and does me no good. Those new nozzles suck
(gas fumes), and blow (gas all over my car.)
