Subject:       Re: Oil?

&gt;&gt; I have tried Castol 40 following the recommendation of a VW mechanic and
&gt; in terms of pressure and oil temperature there was no difference between
&gt; it and 20W50. The only noticeable difference was at cold startup - the 40 took
&gt; much longer to &quot;run through the system&quot;. I was also told that 30W should
&gt; be used at engine break-in (500 miles)...which I followed, then switched to
&gt; 10w30 (for 1000 miles) then 20w50/5W50 (for 15000+ miles).
&gt; 
&gt; With today's quality multigrades why would anyone want to use a single weight
&gt; oil?

Well one reason is that the viscosity extender additives, that keep the 
oil from thinning under higher temps, aren't really very effective 
lubricants (I think they're some sort of polymer), and in the extremely 
wide range multi-vis oils can sufficiently dilute the oil to the point 
they impair efficiency.  I've read some stuff to the effect that you 
should avoid products such as 15W50, 10W40, etc. for this reason.  Of 
course there's potentially a trade-off.    Operating out of the recommended 
temp range also impairs lubrication:  Too hot, the oil thins and doesn't 
coat adequately to protect;  too cool and the oil can't penetrate the 
tighter clearances.  Personally, I find that with 4 changes per year 
(3,000miles / 3 months) I can avoid using the extreme multi-vis products.
