Subject: trip report

First entry - my first van (previous experiance w/ a super beetle)
 
First trip - mid-may out of Boulder (very high van per capita).
temp guage past 230 goin' up hwy 285 into the rockies - first stop.
turned around and tried the pueblo entrance into the arkansas valley
and on to the sand dunes.
 
Toas's only real vw mechanic (no sign, just lots o vans) said 250 is
fine - it has to be w/ most vanagons at high temps and altitude -
and max 270 if top of pass is in sight.  We stuck to the 250 rule and
pulled over again after our 2nd hot springs dip.
Made it across the desert in mid day (114 degrees in the van w/ windows up-
cuts the drag) while other VWs were left on the side of the road.
 
Head up the coast.  bad news - oil all over the bikes and back of the van
- reminds me of my first blown engine.  turns out the oil fill tube
sheared off!
 
Broke an alternator pulley pulling into portland -loud enough to wake the
parents.  no pulleys in portland!!!
 
Got the full search goin' into canada (victoria). i've learned to be clean.
 
yukon - passed 7 RVs in one shot headin' to the arctic circle and beyond
on a gravel/clay road - 500 miles one way.  it started snowin' on the
first day of summer - lost a day waiting that out.
 
alaska - no flats - bought a couple korean tires from a harley guy for &lt;$50
each, 1.5 gallon gas can is enough (even w/o a working gauge)
great salmon, bears, antelope, moose, birds ...........
 
90s on the way back and i couldn't adjust the the timing to let us run
in the middle of the day.  Cut the trip a couple days short due to that
pain.  

Overall lots o' fun &amp; 15K + miles in a little over 2 months!
Definitely would do it again!  if you want some more details of the trip-ask
 
Since then, bought an external oil cooler and done indepenance pass twice,
285, and loveland pass.
