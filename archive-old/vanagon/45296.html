Subject: VW events in WI

I just received my new MOFOCO catalog. It mentions two events of interest:

Bugfest 96: Saturday, July 13 7am-6pm, Great Lakes Dragaway, Union Grove,
WI; includes usual events, including swap meet. Admission: $12 adults, 12
and under $6. Call 800-553-8955 for more info.

Mofoco-Rama: September 13, 14, 15: a sale on new and used parts, tours of
manufacturing plant, free hamburgers, hot dogs, and soda on Sat.; hours:
Fri. 8am-9pm; Sat. 8am-9pm; Sun 8am-5pm.

I am not associated with Mofoco in any way, this is just FYI.
