Subject: RE: replacing strut assembly

Prolly the best thing to do is rent a spring compressor for the strut
assembly.  One time on the road, my strut collapsed.  The spring base just
above the wheel rotted out and was pressing against the tire (A 244D Volvo)
and in a pinch I used about 5 hose clamps to compress the spring for removal.
It werked well but I'd recommend caution when using this emergency method.  
This allowed me to drive to a junk yard and remove and install strut assembly.
(Happened twice before the beast finally died.)
