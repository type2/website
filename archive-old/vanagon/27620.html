&gt; Oh NO! Sounds like the pounded rear main bearing syndrome to me! What is 
&gt; happening is that the rear main bearing is moving in and out when you check the

&gt; installed a standard thrust bearing in a case that has a single thrust cut, or 
&gt; the journal is worn, and needs to be cut. You will need to disassemble the 
&gt; engine to do this. Good news is that it should only cost you about $30.00 for 
&gt; the work.
This is a joke, right?  Disassembling the engine is MAJOR cost.  Isn't 
the gasket set itself over $300?  
checking.....
$189.95 from parts place.
With seals and bearings should put the job at about $400 before labor.
Yikes.
