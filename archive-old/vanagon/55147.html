OK folks, this is insane pricing.  I'm starting to crack.  OK.. I'll sell my
'85 Crewcab autobox for half this, or less even.  Everything works and well,
needs nothing (well clean bumpers would help), extremely solid, minimal seam
rust (too stiff to flex)  Sorry no canopy, but I'd want $2500 more anyhow.
So send the money today!  After seeing $19.5K for a Syncro last week these
numbers are too crazy to resist.  My wife has taken over the Audi, and 4
cars is too many. Make me an offer I can't refuse and I'll deliver it
stateside as far south as Boston. That's about 10hrs from me, it is
reliable.  You of course will be handling importation details... :(  (and
I'll help!) :)


 Seriously folks, it's on the block! Tim

Details:

1985 1.9l CrewCab Transporter  (box stock, no frills/no mods)
colour: in original and shiney white with black trim (complete).
interior: black/black-grey check
seats 6: 1+2 front, 3 rear (no walkthrough)
mileage 203,400Kms
heads done about 75K kms/4yrs ago, no leaks!!
muffler/pipes/hangers all solid
3 spd autotrans, shifts tightly and at VW shift points, no clunks
suspension/shafts/steering all good
no underside rust, rust in dogleg under gas cap
tires: brand new Goodyear Eagles M+S 205/70/14 on rear, fronts are FLAPS M+S
rear/side gates intact/undented, same with cargo bay doors (one hinge pin
needed)
Includes bra (needs some flyscreen/mesh repair)
matching black tonneau cover for rear, (which needs more stitching)

I am second owner, was bought originally as family vehicle, never used for
work. Bed is undamaged, slats intact, except 1.5 missing, so I tend to
believe the PO.
Can't think of what else, your turn.   tim
