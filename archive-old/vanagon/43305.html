&gt;And I've been wanting to take my bus to the dragstrip, just to see if my

and from a very old copy of HOT VWs:

Westfalia Record?
November 10, 1989, I established the official speed record for VW campers
at 87.533 mph at the Bonneville Salt Flats.  My '69 campmobile has a
1776cc engine equipped with Web Cam, dual Dellorto 40s, header system and
Perlux ignition.

yeah, sure. but the accompanying picture looks like he shaved the pop-top
down to about half its normal height! and he has a non-standard aero-spare
on the nose of the bus (that ought to be worth at least 0.000003 Cd). :)
