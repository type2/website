&gt; &gt;parallel to us and there was a crossroad that connected the two
&gt; &gt;roads together.  It was about 100 yards long and covered in 
&gt; &gt;2 1/2 - 3 feet of fluffy snow.  I immediately thought of Derek
&gt; &gt;Drew!!
&gt; 
&gt; Well, even though I haven't had time to write in lately with any reports I
&gt; just got the pictures back from my latest 4 wheeling trip to Vermont. 
&gt; 
&gt; The coolest picture shows the van driving across a, um, I guess you'd call
&gt; it a lake that was in the way of the road/path. My fogg lamps are in the
&gt; body of the vehicle at the same height as the turn signal lenzes. As I drove
&gt; through this lake the fogg lamps went dark because they were under water.
&gt; 
&gt; The van drove right through with no problem. Obviously, as least part of the
&gt; motor was under water, though obviously not the distributor, or I would have
&gt; stalled. Anyway, ever since driving through this thing the van no longer
&gt; idles so perfectly as it has before and sometimes stalls when bone cold on a
&gt; cold day after starting it. I even have to hit the pedal some times to get
&gt; it to start. 
&gt; 

Derek,

I'm probably not speaking just for myself, but maybe you should scan 
those pictures and put them on the Web.  Wink, Wink...

Cheers
Tony

P.S. - It is snowing *AGAIN* today.  Yea Ha!!!
