(...about 914 5-speed tranny in a Bus...)
&gt; 
&gt; The gears will still be driving in the same direction though, so the faces 
&gt; will mate the same way. I don't know the specifics of putting one of these 
&gt; boxes in a bus but I do know several people who have put them in Beetles. 
&gt; There is a slight clearance problem but that probably won't occur in the bus.

if these trannies fit in a Bug you'll have to modify them to put in a Bus: 
Bus trannies are longer. 

Anyway please keep me informed about this:I've got a '73 Bus myself and I'm
very interested in changing the tranny.      

Good luck
