&gt;I've seen two phosphorus free coolants at a local Walmart in Southlake, TX.
One 
&gt;was a Prestone brand and the other I can't remember, seemed like it was a 
&gt;generic Walmart brand.  I was quite surprised.  Cost was $7-8 USD.

&gt;  Sierra is another brand of phosphate FREE antifreeze.  I've used thiis
brand and had very good experience with it!
