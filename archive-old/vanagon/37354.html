I heard that Bosch had some problem with the chips in the FI brain, 
specifically internal cracking of the layers due to cooling problems during 
the manufacture cycle (don't know whose chips).  This was a possible 'real' 
cause of the brains going nuts and acelerating wildly.  This cracking 
problem currently limits the number of substrate layers that can be used to 
fabricate chips. Otherwise multi-level 'thick' chips with higher density per 
footprint size would be possible.  The internally generated heat also leads 
to cracking under use.  Anyone in the VLSI want to tell me the truth of this 
explanation??

Who has been in an Alfa-Romeo 1750GT at 50 mph and watched the same barn 
spin by the windshield twice when the driver did the &quot;Audi two foot 
shuffle&quot;.  Doesn't pay to floor the brakes AND gas while swerving to avoid a 
dog.  I do brake for animals BTW, I just won't swerve!
