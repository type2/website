&gt; Hello all,
&gt; Well, now that I have an operational oil temperature gauge, I'm wondering what
&gt; &quot;normal&quot; oil temps are and what an &quot;extreme&quot; oil temp would be.&gt; Just checking,

Hey, Sean, why are you using Linda J. Bartnik's compuserve account to 
get information about your oil temp?  Just curious.
I have a '72 aircooled bus and here in Seattle when the OAT is 35-50 it 
runs 165-185 no matter how long I run it.  In the summer it goes up as 
high as 220.  When it gets much over that I get worried, not that 
something is wrong, but that I will burn up something becuase you know 
your heads are getting hot and the oil must might fail to do its job.
John
