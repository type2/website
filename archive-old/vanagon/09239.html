on the subject of thievery-

i'm not sure what year this started, but european splitties came standard
with steering locks, and they were an option on N. American vans. Has
anybody tried installing one of these steering locks? Is it necessary to
get a different steering box as well? This might be one more deterrent in
stopping would be thieves. Just a thought. I'd like to hear anybody's
thoughts on the matter.
