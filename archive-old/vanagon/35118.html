Subject: EV Confusing Manual, Help


I would like to thank the list for lots of good information. I
just bought a new '95 EV Camper. As a result of having gone back
and read all the archived list messages, I feel I've made a much
more informed purchase.

One thing that has surprised me though is the owners manual. It's
the most confusing car owners manual I've ever seen. In part it's
a result of trying to document too many configurations and options
in a single manual. Apparently VW has tried to create a single 
English language manual for all EV configurations sold worldwide.

The result is a manual that's difficult to use. The climate control
section is a good example. The pictures show controls that don't 
match the ones that are on my vehicle, and the text refers to controls
A,B,C,D which leads the reader to flip constantly back to the picture
and try to figure out the equivalent controls on the vehicle.

Two very basic things that the manual left me confused about that I'd
like some guidance on are: what type of motor oil is recommended? The 
manual talks about &quot;environmental&quot; motor oil, what are they talking about?
Secondly, is premium gas needed? The manual talks about a lot of different
octane rating systems which left me confused.

Thanks;

-eric
