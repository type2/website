&gt;By the time you have gotten this far, replacing the
&gt;cylinders would seem a *must* in my book.  Some people will
&gt;rebuild with a kit and some people will always replace the
&gt;cylinder.  I see that prices for 1962 front cylinders are
&gt;$36.75 (x 4) at Bus Stop, so I can understand a reluctance
&gt;to avoid $150 in costs.  Glad those for my 67s are only
&gt;$12.75 each!

$150.00 is very cheap life insurance.  While doing the brakes, I would
replace or have an experienced mechanic inspect the cylinders.  At this stage
I would also replace the hoses, and thoroughly inspect all the lines.  They
have a habit of rusting thin and braking when they are needed most.  If oyu
plan on really driving this thing, I wouls definitely upgrade to a 67' up
&quot;Dual Circuit&quot; Brake system.  The Life you save &quot;WILL BE YOUR OWN&quot;.  Although
I admire your learning to do this work, I suggest you get some help with the
Brakes.
Keep on Bussin!
