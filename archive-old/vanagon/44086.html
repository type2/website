Deliberately contaminating the combustion chamber is an invitation to
disaster.  Metal, of any hardness, trapped between the valve and the seat
will quickly lead to a burned valve, and fine swarf that clings to the oil
film with distroy the piston's ability to seal the ring in the grooves.

Quick and easy fixes often lead to replacing the engine.  Hardly a practical
solution.

If you have a stripped plug-bore, drop the engine, pull the head and deal
with it.  And thereafter use proper length plugs and anti-sieze compound.
