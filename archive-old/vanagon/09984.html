Subject: Vacum lines suck....


I can't remember how to spell vacum,
anyway, I am still wondering where in the heck
all the vacum lines are supposed to go on my bus.

Could someone with a 76-82 poke there head under the
hatch and look for me?  Bentley offers info on all
but the decel valve. Puhlease????
 
 
The more gooder news is that I have all the pieces to the
BA6 rounded up excepting a few peices of ducting that
I am going to try and make, my new engine runs fairly well,
and I have all my new body panels welded on.

The badder news is that my cold start injector isn't injecting.
Hopefully its the thermo time switch.  If it is, I am thining
about wiring a switch to the dash to manually do it.
Anyone done this?

Happy Groundhogs day (soon)
Matt
