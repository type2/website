Subject: poor shifting when engine running 79 bus

Folks, 
I have been having trouble lately with stiff shifting in my 79 bus(manual
transmission).  When the engine is NOT running, it'll shift great.
Once I start the engine, though, the shifting is incredible stiff.
I can't get the bus into reverse unless I start it in reverse and the clutch in.
Does this sound familiar to anyone?

Thanks, 
Paul
