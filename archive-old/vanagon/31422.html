&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;      But I could not find any final report. Did anyone try this?

&gt; Seriously, from previous threads about this, as long as you keep a 
&gt; window cracked open while doing this setup, you should be okay.

Yeah, David's camper stayed pretty warm at Big Sur last year, and I don't 
remember the interior getting soaked in water, but doesn't running 
propane inside create a big water vapour problem?  Does the clay pot 
somehow trap the water vapour produced by the propane stove flame?  I 
know whenever we try to even toast bagels on our propane stove the 
interior of the camper steams up big time--and it gets worse the colder 
it is outside.  I'm kinda worried about soaking the interior of our 
camper, since it doesn't need any more rust than it has already.

And hey, everybody, happy winter solstice celebration, and may 
all your busses need nothing more than routine maintenance in 1996!
