Subject: Color sanding? good/bad?

&gt;Color sanding with 600grit?  The very least you should use
&gt;on any acrylic product is 1200, 1500 is better.  You will
&gt;NEVER buff out the scratches created with 600 or even 1000
&gt;grit.

I have no reason to doubt you.  It *has* been a few years
since I did my body and paint work.

&gt;Also you MUST use water when using 1200 or 1500 grit.

No question.  All of this work should be done with as much
water as possible.  Goes without saying, as I was dumb
enough to write.

&gt;Just a thought.

Actually, several thoughts, and good ones.

As I said, it *has* been a few years since I went through
that process.  I really do not remember which grit I used,
but I know I had a few runs that I sanded flat before
proceeding with a finer grit.  But then again, I did not
have this list back then.  :)

Thanks for the tips.
