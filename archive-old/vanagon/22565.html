Subject: Re: VWCOA Autoist Want Ads ...

Hi gang,
reading the want ads about the 90 Carat GL with the rear-facing 2nd
seats reminded me to ask...
My '90 (non-Carat) GL comes with the standard forward facing bench;
aside from the holes in the carpet being in a different place, does the
floor have additional bolt holes or just different bolt holes to
accommodate the different position of the bolts to hold the rear-facing
seat down.  IOW, how much of a pain would it be to mount my bench to
face to the rear without the people in the back knocking knees?
