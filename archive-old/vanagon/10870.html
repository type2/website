Subject: VW-1600 ENGINE-STRIPPED POINT SCREW HOLE

From: Nick Pace &lt;nickpace_at_rand_dot_org&gt;

On a trip out of town some time ago, I was adjusting the points on my '71
Bus and watched helplessly as the hold-down screw spun around without a
care in the world (never, ever decide to give the beast a quick tune
before the ride home).  Replacing the screw did not help as it seemed that
the minimal amount of threads in the hole in the point plate was the
culprit.  Larger screws did not work because of the narrowness of the slot
on the points.  Nothing seemed to work to get the screw to bite until I
gooped up the hole with Loc-Tight, set the points, and let it dry
overnight.  That did the trick (thank God) but this was to be an emergency
measure only and was designed to get me home and then to the parts store
to find and purchase what I assumed to be the standard fix for what
should be a common problem.  Well, I was told that the only cure was a new
distributor!  There was no way in Hell that I was going to drop some
incredible amount of money just because of a stripped thread.  I then
decided to immediately drive around and find a junk distributor and swap
point plates (or whatever) before my emergency fix broke.  Getting a used
distributor, especially one with advance and retard, turned out to be much
more difficult than I had expected.  One thing lead to another and like
all emergency road-side repairs on a VW Bus, it has now had to last for a
year.  I had forgotten all about it until this weekend.  We went up to
Badger Pass in Yosemite and it appears that the vibrations from the snow
chains caused the point screw to loosen and the points slipped to zero
clearance at exactly the wrong time (right in the middle of a very wet
snow storm at night).  I reset the points very gingerly, crossed my
fingers all the way back down Hwy 99, and swore I would take care of this
as soon as I got back to Malibu.  I'm sure I heard the Bus chuckle at
another one of my lame repair-related promises.

OK, I want to take care of this (I swore, remember?).  What can I do
besides buying another distributor?  Any ideas besides forgetting about it
and dealing with the problem when it really raises its ugly head?

Thanks,

Nick
