Subject: High BC Prices (was re: 82 Westy Diesel)

&gt;I'd say so! An '82 Westy Diesel was going for $9995 in my area last
&gt;week - sold by the time I called... aarrghh.

Are you kidding? $9995 for an '82 diesel!!! I'll definitely drive mine
to BC if I need to sell it. (Not that I would ever volounteerly part
from it)

---------------------------------
And guess what - there's another one this week in Vancouver for 
$9500! And a couple of '80-81s for between $5000-6900, which still seems 
high, but better than none at all, I guess...

I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
