Subject:       van back - body work done!

Just a semi-final note on my pasted '87... Got the van back
yesterday and the body work is superb.  all new sheet metal, no
filler.  the paint is just excellent.  as an added bonus, when i
picked the van up i saw they had also painted the entire passenger
side then buffed up the tailgate and front too!  this was in trade
for R-R of the Westy interior by myself but it was just s'posed to be
'touch up' on some dings.  the owner smiled at me and said, 'yeah, we
got a little carried away'

Now, i'm getting nervous at the thought of re-installing that 
interior... i fear it will take longer than the 6 hours it took me to 
remove it.  Good thing is i got my fridge tuned up, sanded/repainted 
the propane tank, and will be replacing some rusty exterior screws 
with SS ones.

anyone need the name of a good body shop in northern Minnesota?!
