I do roadside assistance for Mercedes-Benz at my job. I responded to a
call,apparently a dead battery. When I tried the car, the battery was
good,ie:lights,radio,etc. worked, but the key in the ignition on position
revealed no dash lights, and no cranking in the crank position. I checked
the connections on the ignition switch,they were ok, and I was about to
suggest he get the car towed, when I decided to check a terminal block
under the hood which connects the battery power to the rest of the car. One
of the wires was slightly loose, but seemed to me tight enough for a
connection to be made. I tightened it,sure that it would do no good.
Well,guess what? The car was fixed. I've been telling people for years how
important tight electrical connections are, and here I doubted my own
advice. Go figure...
