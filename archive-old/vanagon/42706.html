Subject: Re: Barndoors, Splitters, Breadloafs, etc

&gt;&gt;Would someone give me a brief description the following so that I may
&gt;&gt;recognize
&gt;&gt;one when I pass it in my Westy?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Barndoor
&gt;
&gt; A large, sometimes double apparatus on hinges which swings open to let cows
&gt;out...
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Splitter
&gt;
&gt;A device used by weekday accountants on the weekends to facilitate the
&gt;destruction of already small pieces of wood. Usually done to impress the
&gt;often only date they will get while pretending to be manly men.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Breadloaf
&gt;
&gt;That which mom used to serve us when we had no meat....
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Crew Cab
&gt;
&gt;Often found parked near the docks or ports of entry. Beware the driver of
&gt;this vehicle as he(or she) is wont to deliver you and your mates to tawdry
&gt;areas of ill repute... or worse as they have working relationships with
&gt;most Western Autos and Jiffy Lubes countrywide.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Single Cab
&gt;
&gt;While not as bad as the above, This patronizer of TGIFridays and other
&gt;Happy-hour hang-outs is dangerous due the nature of his/her occupation.
&gt;Sure, happy hour is harmless enough for a while, but once you've had a
&gt;happy hour or two....where will it stop?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Dual Cab
&gt;
&gt;As we all know it IS the nineties and this is the age of sexual openess
&gt;and/or awareness......
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;others?
&gt;
&gt;Small aquatic animals. They love to float on their backs while munching
&gt;fish. Merlin(sp?) Perkins of Mutual of Omaha used to remark that they
&gt;were &quot;frisky and mischievious&quot;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;obVW: My accountant (who is not a geek..as I'm sure none of them are)
&gt;drives a VW... Mine actually as I couldn't afford to pay the fraud what
&gt;he claims I owed him AND the Guv`ment....  jus kidding...
&gt;
