Subject: OK, barndoor nuts! What's this?

Item Subject: cc:Mail Text
     All right all you barndoor freeks, tell me what year this one is and 
     what is it worth.
     
     I found it yesterday in the Sierras.  It is definitely a barndoor, 
     very rust free (no thru the body rust holes) with all the parts there. 
      I couldn't get a look at the body number badge because of this mad 
     rotwiler that lives with it.  It has semiphors, bullet blinkers that 
     are inside and below center of the headlights, and the cutiest little 
     sewing machine in the rear, I'm sure it's original.  The popup is only 
     about 3 foot by 2 foot just over the side doors.  four windows per 
     side.  It looks like it had been sitting here for a while, at least a 
     couple of years or so.  It looks to be complete as far as camping 
     setup, but the wood does need work.
     
     Is it worth my persuing (like I don't know already)?
     
     Tell me quick before some wannabe comes by and gives him any price he 
     asks.
     
     Cecil
