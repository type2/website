Subject: brake parts... help ...NOBODY ???

Dear fellow listmembers,
Either my question didn't get posted, or this is is my first post that
drew a total blank from all of you. Or, of course, everyone's out on the
beach. Which is where I should be if I had a life...I'll try once more:

Hi out there!
  I'm gonna put new disc and drum brake pads on my 73 bus pretty soon, but I
couldn't find any place that has the small parts (like,
springs\clips\pins...). Not even Rocky Mtn. Motorworks. Does anyone have a
source for those?
  Cheers,
            Gregor
