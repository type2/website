saw it the other night up here too. just about fell out of my chair! not
too many splits on the TV. judging by the glimpse i got of the van, those
cargo doors look pretty rotted out.

why do they always have to make splits in the context of rotted out old
hippy vans? maybe i should ask US customs about that preconception as well.

&gt;&gt;Just saw a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup ad on tv which featured an old guy
&gt;&gt;sitting in back of his parked split window, sort of winter camping/sort of
&gt;&gt;playing with some kind of electronic (tube era) equipment. A meteor thing
&gt;&gt;falls to earth in the background and the old grizzled guy gets out of his van,
&gt;&gt;looks around puzzled-like.
&gt;&gt;Don't know why, but I thought of Joel when I saw it :)
&gt;

&gt;sides, i know what them meteor things are. ain't puzzled.
