Subject: FS: Stock Wheels and Covers (Hubcaps)

Updated posting-

As I have received 10 inquires on either the wheels and/or hubcaps, it was
easier to repost a &quot;full&quot; set of info for all/any interested individuals. I
have also tried to research &quot;fair price&quot; a little on my own.

I have a set of 4 (probably 5) VW original steel wheels for sale. They come 
attached to original Michelin MXL reinforced 205/70 R14 tires.

I also have 4 Hub caps, picture displayed by a comercial vendor at:
http://www.hub-caps_dot_com/vw/BU1061510.gif who quotes the dealer price as
$61.66 but doesnot state his price (I did &quot;Inquire&quot; but have had no response.)

My dealer quotes the price for the steel wheels (believe it or not!) at $121
And for the Hub Caps $65.

They are off of a '91 Vanagon Westfalia with 28K original 1 owner miles. 
The hubcaps/wheel covers look great - no noticable scratches, chips, etc. They
are dirty and I need to wash them up, but in the early morning light they
really look almost new. The wheels are standard steel wheels - what else can I
say. I do not believe that the spare has ever been on the ground, the other
4 Michelins have the 28k wear on them - the rear 2 are better than the front 2.

I recovered the Alloy spare from my burned Westy last week and plan to clean
the black gunk off as best I can and carry it as a spare - freeing up the 
steel one for sale. They are HEAVY so I am not sure they are worth the hastle
of shipping (unless the buyer knows a cheap method of shipment).

I would like to sell the 4 wheel covers as a set if possible (I like keeping
things together!) One list member says you can get Kmart PVS hubs at about
$20 each. Another list member says he saw some VW hubs &quot;a few years ago in MI
at a little shop&quot; for $25 each.

Based on condition and the different price info I have, I am asking $35 each
for them - and believe they are worth it. Buyer pays shipping, I package 
carefully to protect condition. If I don't sell them on the list I will take
them to a number of shows this summer - but the value will only increase with
time and they are not hard to store.

The 4 used steel wheels and Michelins . . . well that's another story. I can
store them - for a while. But I still have the hardtop to my 1975 Triumph
Spitfire, French Blue if you know of a buyer! Have the Boot for the soft top
too. So needless to say, I get hasseled about how much storage space I use
for &quot;useless&quot; items.

I can't believe that the dealer price is $121 apiece for these! I really have
no idea what I should ask or expect. If I don;t get an interesting offer, I'll
check at the shows/swaps.

The one spare with &quot;new&quot; Michelin MXL 205/70 R14 is another story. It seems
that the tire alone is &quot;priceless from all the people looking for 1. Perhaps
I should entertain bids on this. I paid $91 plus shipping for each of my new
Michelin MXTs. Offers will be accepted. Again, attached to the steel wheel, it
is heavy. I personally can't detach it from the wheel - but I could probably
find someone to do so at a cost.

Sorry so long a &quot;note&quot; but seemed to be the best way to get info back to those
who sent in inquires about pricing, condition, style, etc.
