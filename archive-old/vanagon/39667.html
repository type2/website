Subject: rear dune buggy shocks needed.not v.w. but it's friday.

My girlfriend has assigned me the job of locating some shocks for a dune
buggy she is working on.  I thought some one out there might be able to
help.  They need to be either 20 inches fully extended with 6-7 inches of
travel or 22 inches fully extended with 7-8 inches of travel.  they must
also be the complete spring and damper package, not just the damper.  I
think they are using a briggs engine so the thing must be pretty light. 
If anyone could get me the number of a mail order company It would be
grately apreciated. 
thanks. 
Ed.
