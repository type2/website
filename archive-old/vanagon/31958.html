Subject: 1989 Vanagon A/C controls?

Hi all,
This question is specific to the 1989 model year of Vanagons.

I've seen 1988 Vanagons (Non campers) with A/C controls mounted on the A/C
console and some mounted on the dash.  I'm fairly certain that all 90 &amp; 91s
came with dash mounted controls.

For those of you with 89s (Non campers), Where are your A/C controls?
