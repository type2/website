Ah, yes, my ancient 109D II Land Rover rattles in it's grave.  All the older
LRs were aluminum panels and poorly painted but whatheheck it din't rust and
who cares in Zambia anyway.

Arnolt-MG, most of the cars by PininFarina Carrosserie that weren't multi
production. AC, AC Cobra, Lotus super sevens, Alfa GTZ, Alfa GiuliaSS, Alfa
TI Super autodelta, Tipo 61 Maserati, Porsche 904, 908, 916, Jag C,D,SS,
Lister Corvette, MBZ 300SLR, ... lots of em..

Many of the Bertone one offs, many of the Zagato racers.   All fine rides
none in my near future.

BTW, syncroing across the desert was great...
