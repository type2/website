Subject: Re: Blizzard of '96

&gt;Exhaust is most likely from the combination of leak under the bus
&gt;(most likely the infuriating connection between heater box and
&gt;header), and leaks into the upper engine compartment from below.
&gt;The heater boxes are unlikely to leak exhaust directly into the outer shell

        Ok, we're chock full of greasy do it yourselfer's here, right?
Here's my proposal: I hate that dammned connection between the header and
heater box as much as the next guy. If I knew how, I would get rid of it
and put in something that'd last longer than 2 weeks. Anybody got any
ideas? Airplane parts? Some kind of mating face with bolts like a regular
exaust port to header connection? Mebbe take acouple of old headers and
weld the exaust port mating face onto the heater box and header, thereby
making a bolt-together setup with a gasket inbetween? Anything less
permanent that welding them? Don't laugh, when I bought my bus the PO had
*welded* the 2 together-I guess he thought that he'd never have to remove
the pipes, duh. Made it real fun for me to remove them. That guy was a real
brain surgeon.

Peace,
