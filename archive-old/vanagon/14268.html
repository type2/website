So David Garth says:
&gt; 
&gt; How about Yosemite in Spring. They'll be lots of water, spectacular water 
&gt; falls, cool days, cooler nights, and HOT SHOWERS, Martha. (At Curry 
&gt; Village for $1, nice, clean, white tile.)
&gt; 
&gt; I have seen it snow in Yosemite in April, lightly, usaully, but late May 
&gt; would be almost sure fire nice weather. How about May 26, 27, 28. Or is 
&gt; that Memorial Day?

Dave,

How tough would it be to get reservations?
