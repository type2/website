&lt;&lt; On the emergency brake bracket - the triangular piece that holds the brake
 lever to the dashboard - there is s very small little push button attached
to
 a wire which gets lost somewhere under the dash. When I push it nothing
seems
 to happen. Any ideas what it is?
 
 Also mysterious to me is in the dash, just under the glove compartment, is
 a plug which looks like a stereo input jack - the big kind - except it's
not.
 1/2 inch silver rim. Also connected to some wires which get lost in the
tangle.
 Any ideas on this one? &gt;&gt;

Hi, Kathy!!  congrats on your new westy.

the little black button on your e-brake lever mount is the switch that lights
up that little round red &quot;B&quot; light on your dash, that tells you that your
parking brake is on. 
(p.s. - don't drive w/ that light on....  :&lt;)

and as far as the little round socket underneath your glovebox - that's a
European style  outlet for any 12volt accessory you want to use in the bus
(maplight, lighter,tire inflator compressor, shaver, TV, etc,) 
You can go to your local BMW motorcycle dealer, and ask for a &quot; Male plug for
the heated BMW motorcycle jacket&quot;  and they'll sell the plug to you for 7 to
9 dollars, and you can wire it into any accessory you want. 

neat, huh??  :&lt;)
