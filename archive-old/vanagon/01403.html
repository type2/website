&gt;Cheapest engines are in the 74-77 range; their longevity is suspect because
&gt;few of them got past 60k miles without needing at least top end overhaul and
&gt;often more.  Before and after that range, 120-150kmiles is possible with

The problem with these engines (the 2.7) was the case was not really strong
enough to take the added horsies and the constant changes caused by heating up
and cooling down.  A common solution is a Dilovar stud kit, but that only goes
so far.  A 2.2 with webers is not a bad idea - Zeniths don't seem to work
very well; or perhaps a 2.4 with mechanical injection, which is my personal
favorite.  A MFI motor with consistently outperform carbs, both in
driveability and adaptabilty (altitudes, ambient temperature &amp; such).  My
2.4 MFI always blows the doors off of my friends' 2.7's.  Sounds cool, too!

&gt;less.  The best situation to find, if you can afford it, is a well-maintained
&gt;78-80 3.0 liter engine that is being removed, still healthly, to be replaced
&gt;by a 3.2 or Turbo engine.  Such an engine might go for $4000 complete and have
&gt;50,000 troublefree miles in it before it needs anything.

The 78 and later motors are probably some of the best in the world.  There are
stories of people getting 300,000 to 400,000 miles on them.  I would put one
in my car (911) in a heartbeat, if you would be so kind as to float me a loan 
for 4G's (as in geez! How much!)

I'm not so sure you'd wanna put the turbo engine in the vanagon, though.  
There is a lot of work to put one in a 911, and it was made for it...  Its 
also a bitch to adjust the valves on a turbo motor, or do anything else for 
that matter.  It would be intersting to see where you put the intercooler, 
though...

Try PartsHeaven (800) 767-7250 for used stuff, or EASY (in Emeryville, 
by Oakland) whose number I don't have handy...
