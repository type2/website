Subject: Top Ten from Old Bus Registry

wannABUSERS:

A month or so ago I mentioned the Old Bus Registry
information I've been entering for NEATO.  Today I finished
(LSMFT) the &quot;data entry&quot; phase, having read/typed through
270 stories, histories, descriptions and have a Top Ten
examples of the abuse or &quot;adaptive reuse&quot; of a bus:

10) Left in barn for 25 years.
 9) Left outside for 25 years without sunroof.
 8) Sunk to the frame in muck.
 7) Trees growing up through the sunroof.
 6) Towed (stripped) to police impound.
 5) Used as a dog house.
 4) Used as a chicken coop.
 3) Nearly cut in half by an Olds.
 2) Used as dune buggy

And after all of that, the #1 example of abuse of a bus goes
to someone on the list--the septic tank story.

Interesting anecdotal asides:  There's the Julia Roberts
bus, a '65 Yellow Deluxe.  And there's the bus bought from
the estate of a guy who shot his wife and himself an hour
after painting his bus.  (Wear the mask when you paint
folks!)

BTW, LSMFT is not Lucky Strike Means Fine Tobacco, it's
Let's Stop, My Finger's Tired.
