&gt;What I fault Winnebago for is their failure to plan for light weight
&gt;construction.  It is almost unconscienable for them to put 3/4&quot;
&gt;plywood throughout.  The cabinets, everything, are made out of this
&gt;heavy duty stuff.  They could of, and should of, designed using
&gt;aluminum and plastics.

This is a bad chapter for mainly all conversion factories I know
in Germany. They all make the furniture out of cheap but heavy
chipboards instead of using light poplar plywood. But a few learned
from the Caravan factories and I hope they all will change their
mind sometimes.
