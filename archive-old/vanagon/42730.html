&gt;I say this because I want to clarify that I don't have the wrong seal.
&gt;3mm is big enough to be noticed.  That said, I can't get the seal 
&gt;back into the thing.  I had two ordered since one side was leaking.  
&gt;Both of those are now gone.  I have tried using one big socket, a 
&gt;washer/socket combination and the small taps with a hammer method.  I 
&gt;froze the seal thinking I could shrink it just enough.  No dice.  I 
&gt;now have four of those seals ordered hoping I get one of them in 
&gt;there.  The most recent advice I have gotten is to soak the seal in 
&gt;some hot water in hopes of softening the rubber just enough that it 
&gt;will squeeze in there.  I will try that first when the next batch of 
&gt;seals arrives.  If that doesn't work I am down to removing the thing 
&gt;and using a press.  Oh, the seals are 'elring' or some such.  They are
&gt;supposed to be OEM.  Thanks, Jim

Use a deburring tool to make a chamfer on the seal housing.  It is a very
tight fit and you may have to remove the seal carrier and use a press to
install the seal.  If you do this, make sure you install the carrier in
&quot;EXACTLY&quot; the samr position it was in before.  The carrier adjust the bearing
preload and ring gear position.
