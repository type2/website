Subject: Re: I need some help (over and above the obvious)

I strongly believe that message lists are most valuable when they stick 
fairly closely to the matter at hand.  I read the sports page for sports, 
not the movie schedule, the funnies for humor, not the want ads, and the 
vanagon list for info on my bus, not politics, social commentary or other 
topics.

Most lists or forums have this problem but tend to self-police or the 
people who seek a wider scope find it in other lists or even make their own.
