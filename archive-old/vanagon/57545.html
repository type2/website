Subject: Re: On-Line Catalog?

Several people on and off the lists who have seen our new web page have
commented on the possibilities of an on-line catalog of the stuff we sell.
 Over the weekend I have developed several new pages showing an index and
specific product areas and have moved some of our product off the main page
to other pages that can be linked from the index.  Nothin' fancy and it's
marginal to start, but it is a start.  Hope to have alot more linked pages to
show up as time progresses and allows.  Appreciate the comments, suggestions,
questions and general support so far.

Thanks
