&gt;That seems like a lot of work.  Here an old bus, van trick for you. Remove the rear axels, add grease, switch sides and reinstall.  They are good for another 30k.  It causes the bearings to run in a different position, like you found in yours.

&gt; Hi folks
&gt;  I Am new at computers and this list.(Double trouble) This my third attempt
&gt; to send this message. If it doesn't go thru please help me with a reply of
&gt; what I'm doing wrong. I will pay anything you ask.
&gt;   I thought I'd share this money saver regarding CV joints on my 84 Vanagon.
&gt; One of my CVs was  making that dying clunking sound so when I went to replace
&gt; it I had to dismantle the old one to see what the damage looked like. I
&gt; disassembled and cleaned everything and discovered damage to all the races
&gt; that the balls ride in ( the balls themselves looked undamaged)  But the
&gt; damage was only at one end of the races. It looked like the balls had never
&gt; ridden in the other ends of the races. Apparently the normal axle movement (
&gt; at least on my van ) is not enough to make the balls move the entire length
&gt; of the races. ( Maybe on only the most extreme bumps ?) So I reassembled and
&gt; repacked it , turned it 180 degrees and put it back on the axle ( it's
&gt; symmetrical) so the balls are now riding in the never or little used ends of
&gt; the races. That was 20k ago. No more clunking. The new CVJ is still sitting
&gt; on my shelf.
&gt;   If you try this, be sure to put a directional mark on it before removing it
&gt; from the axle, so you can reverse it .
&gt;    Also, for damages balls, the bearing company I deal with (Bruening
&gt; Bearing) will mic. Old balls and sell individual new ones.
