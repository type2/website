As I recall, it's phosphate free, but I'll look at the bottle when I get
home.  I used to put it in a Honda.

&gt;      Gerry says it has phosphate; Mark says it's phosphate-free.

&gt; &gt; Call Jill Jasek, at Sierra: 800-288-7234.  She's anwered all of my
&gt; &gt; questions to my satisfaction about Sierra and its properties. I use it in
&gt; &gt; my '84 Westy, including  the flush product and the hydrometer (?) used to
&gt; &gt; test, and to date, after about about six months, I've had no evidence of
&gt; &gt; any deterioration. If you are still concerned about rust and corrosion
&gt; &gt; inhibition,  ask her for a source for comparative data and information,
&gt; &gt; which I assume she has available.
&gt; 
&gt; But it's NOT Phosphate Free.
