Subject: Re: Syncro Estasy, spins, ABS

&gt;I remember reading that a Synchro cannot be towed, since the
&gt;drive train can't be disconnected and the system doesn't like to driven
&gt;long distances with power flowing in from the wheels. This suggests that
&gt;the Syncro is always in 4WD. Is that true?

The syncro must either be towed on a flatbed, or it can be towed if you take
the rear-to-front drive shaft off temporarily. The drive shaft can be removed
with a good quality little 13mm wrench so all syncro owners should be sure to
carry one of these in case they need a tow with a regular tow truck.

Yes, it is always in 4WD but unless the wheels are slipping, only 10% of the
torque goes the the front wheels.
