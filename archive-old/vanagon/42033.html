Subject: 87 GL Hard to Get in Gear


Hello again-

I thought that I would throw out another problem for help.

My 87 GL is sometimes difficult to get into 1st gear.  In addition, it 
&quot;pops&quot; out of reverse frequently.  Are there some adjustments to be made? 
 Any advice would be appreciated.  I have not consulted my Bentley yet.

Thanks-
