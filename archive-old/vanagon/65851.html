We have stopped a number of times and talked to the owner. All of his
busses have had the heads done by him and typically run in the $7-$8k
range. I have not done business with him but he seems knowledgeable.
It's a great place to get out , stretch your legs and check out the cars
and busses after a long drive across the UP or Wisconsin! Business name
is European Car Service  906 932-5720.

&gt;
&gt;      List members -
&gt;
&gt;      On a recent road trip to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan we drove
&gt;      through Ironwood, MI on U.S. 2.  Ironwood is a great little town
&gt; with
&gt;      a VW shop called European Repairs.  This shop had about 12
&gt; vanagons
&gt;      and busses including a 87 syncro in good condition with 89K miles
&gt; and
&gt;      the price was $8K. There were 30-40 Rabbits, Golfs, ect... also
&gt; on the
&gt;      lot.  We went through on Sunday am and just walked the lot and
&gt; was
&gt;      unable to locate a phone number.
&gt;
&gt;      Break downs can happen any where.  I just thought you folks might
&gt; want
&gt;      to add this shop to your list.  Having traveled the U.P. of
&gt; Michigan
&gt;      and northern Wisconsin, VW shops are not on every corner.
&gt;
&gt;      Does the list have information on &quot;good&quot; shops?
