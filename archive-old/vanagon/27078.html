Lucky you.  I won't sweep all of the truck drivers into the nether regions,
but Texas must have gotten all of the ones who need to be there *first*.

Examples:

My mirror says &quot;renilthgierF&quot;.
The rear set of wheels are a foot on *my* side of the stripe as they pass
my window - changing lanes to get in front of me.

And the gravel trucks about 70 miles west of here are the worst.
These guys will go three-abreast to drag race - on a two-lane (each way)
highway.  They will not give up just because they encounter oncoming
traffic.  *You* have to go off the road.
They play &quot;tag&quot; (bump the other truck then whip around and wait for him to
&quot;tag&quot; you back.
They squish little things like VWs (or even Cadillacs, for that matter)
that get in their path.
