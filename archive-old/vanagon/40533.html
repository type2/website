Subject: Re: red rock

It looks like mystery VanBondo family may com out of hiding for the Red
Rocks fling. Mrs. VanBondo brought it up to me last night after it had been
decided that it was a &quot;no go&quot; due to a prior commitment to a neighbor's
Cinco de Mayo party.  In her defense she said that she had been thinking
that it would be fun to meet all of the people that we had defamed on the
IRC. Hahaha! When initially told about the Red Rocks gathering she asked if
we would have to drive hundreds of miles and if everyone would be partying
their ***es off, playing music, riding gopeds, burning magnesium, freezing,
putting up with the wind, and talking VWs. I confirmed her impression. She
is *thrilled* at the opportunity. 
Sign us up for the &quot;kitty cake.&quot; 
Don't look for us until really late Friday night or screamingily early Sat AM.
