Subject: '81 westy FS near SF


For sale near San Francisco (thought I had this sold, but the
person was out of the area and decided not to go ahead);

1981 westfalia, ivory-yellow color
4 speed manual transmission
current/valid registration
factory air-conditioning
mileage:  138K
185R/14 Michelin XZX tires, newish, cable chains included
deluxe camper package; everything present and working
owned by non-smoker

add-ons:  
guages - oil temp, oil press, cyl. head temp, volt meter
CB unit - mounted atop box containing guages
Bentley factory service manual
also, I had an external oil cooler added (this is set
to go on automatically if oil temps exceed 185F, but also
has an over-ride switch in case one wants to turn it on
in other circumstances)

upgrades/improvements since I acquired the car at 106K:  
new upholstery everywhere - including padding for beds
new engine, Mark Stevens heads
new clutch, starter, struts, CV joints, master brake cylinder
recent new paint - home job, but looks quite good; body is excellent
3 extra auxilliary batteries, including 2 golf-carts under rear seat
   front floor mats
 
I have all records since I've owned the car
Have had the car serviced/maintained regularly since I've owned it.

Everything is present and operative on the car with the exception of the
following:

faucet knob top is cracked - works on tank water fine, though
missing front bumper end cap
fuel guage - works fine when full, but disappears to below E after 1/3 tank

And yes, the sliding door works perfectly. J:)

Price:  $3,999 obo.  If interested, contact...
