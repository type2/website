Subject: Re: How to Replace Tach Light??
Date: Tue, 3 Jan 1995 19:41:10 -0800 (PST)

&gt; 
&gt; Simple problem, looks like a difficult answer. The light on my Tach went 
&gt; out and my '86 Owner's manual tells me how to replace almost every other 
&gt; light on the vehicle EXCEPT the instrument lights. 
&gt; It would SEEM tobe simple, but... is it? 
&gt; and if so, how?
&gt; Thanks, Jack

This actually is pretty simply, pull the cover from over the cluster and
you will see two instrument panel light assemblies mounted at the top of
both the housings for the speedometer and the tach.  You can by the
fixture from VW and just insert the new one in the hole (I think you have
to turn them to get them out). 

You can go cheap, however and just by the bulb from your local FLAPS and 
pull the bulb out of the fixture and just replace that.  This is a little 
tricky because the bulb is actually soldered into its mount.  Remove the 
bulb from the mount with needlenose pliers and insert new bulb--you have 
to turn the wire connections so that they hit the connections inside the 
mount (this will be self explanatory when you see it).  The replacement 
bulb without the mount is a #74 and can be bought at almost any auto 
parts store (Pep Boys 2 for $1.99).  I don't know what VW charges for the 
whole assembly and I don't want to find out).
