Subject: Old Westy Saga (Bus Vulture)


Well, here's the report.  I got to the guy's place in Alabama about
4:30 in the afternoon &amp; said &quot;Hi, my name's Dave.  Where's the bus?&quot;
He took me around back &amp; said &quot;there she is, look her over &amp; see if 
that's what yer lookin' for.&quot;

Good points:
Bus is practically rust free.  Two rust holes in the entire bus.  One
next to the brake fluid resevoir, barely more than a pinhole, the other
in the rocker under cargo doors, about the size of a quarter.  Crawled
underneath &amp; it looked almost like new.  Original paint &amp; the asbestos
wrap around the heater tube looked as if it were put on there last week.
It also had an ambulance fan.

Bad points:
The guy was absolutely not shy about cutting the bus.  Additional brake
lights above originals.  Additional front turn signals above bullets.
Engine cooling vents cut out &amp; idiot air scoop installed.  Two guages
(fuel &amp; oil temp) cut into dash.  Dent in driver door &amp; dogleg.
Missing cabinet directly behind passenger (where tumblers would be 
stored) &amp; rear cabinet on driver's side.  Missing one rear lamp cover.
Must have started leaking at some point because submarine hatch sealed 
with tar.  Front seat from a ford pickup.

All in all about half as nice as he described over the phone.  I agreed
to his asking price ($650) &amp; paid him.  Then things got ugly.  Remember
in the previous post I said someone else had put a deposit down &amp; 
couldn't pay it off?  He showed up.  He had sent his wife to the bank
to get a loan.  Allen explained to him their contract stated he was to
pay the balance in 3 weeks and it had been nearly 8 weeks.  Allen even
returned his downpayment (which he didn't have to contractually).  The
kid was heartbroken &amp; I felt really bad for him although he didn't look
like he could afford to get it back on  the road.

Anyway, I got his name &amp; number &amp; told him I would try to find another
bus for him.  I decided against towing the it with my bus for that long
a distance, so I'm renting a truck to trailer it back this weekend.

Anyone with leads on the cabinets &amp; light cover please let me know.
Plans are to spend a couple of weeks going through mechanicals &amp; then
straight to the body shop to weld it up &amp; paint it (original color,
Sealing Wax Red).
