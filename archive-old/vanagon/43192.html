Subject: Mermen, Rolling Concours &amp; Drivable Feast

	Its not Friday so I'm just posting the dates until then, but
those psychedelic Mermen are on tour again, in the heartland of the USA.
Ear protection might be appropriate if you are up front- that's *real*
feedback, not some studio trick :) I'll get to see 'em when they get
back to the Bay Area in July. My favorate bus music, and not much like
the Grateful Dead, now that you ask.

MAY 

Wed 29 - Jazz Haus - Lawrence, KS
Thu 30 - Link's Club - St. Louis, MO
Fri 31 - Blind Pig - Champagne/Urbana, IL


	Autoweek is sponsoring a Rolling Concours and Drivable Feast
in Detroit in mid-summer and (for the second year running) at the
Monterey Historics and Concours. Last year Jean and I took the Corrado,
to the Pacific Grove/Carmel/Monterey deal, this year we're thinking of 
Little Martha, the '70 single-cab. I'll post info on how to register 
(there's a fee, for which you get a goodie bag and all procedes to local 
charity). I don't remember exactly when the Detroit get together is,
the Monterey Historic Races are usually the last weekend in August.

	There were no Busses at Pacific Grove last year, although there
were 25 Vipers, three Beetles and a '41 Ford Woodie... (If you say its 
a 'sports car', its a sports car :)  ). Perhaps some of the CCC
will join us...
