well, either this guy has put a water-cooled engine into the thing
(Holy Hemi's,  Batman!) ... and it's not a small water-cooled engine, either
... or he's shoe-horned a rather large Lycoming or Continental aircraft
engine in there!!!!
350 cubic engines is a BIG air-cooled engine, imho.  that's like 5.7 LITERS!
