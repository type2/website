I have convertered my Vanagon from diesel to GTi power. Works well except for
two problems: 1) Keep losing the oil pump prime so you have to rev to 2000
rpm to get the pump to pick up!!! then the pressure comes right up and works
fine.  The motor has lasted 50,000  - but it cant be good. I'm build a new
motor, as this one has a total of 160,000 on it and finally blew a radiator
hose and overheated it.2) The other problem is the  cooling system, has
always been marginal. Has anyone tried changing the pulley   ratio or is
there a hi capacity water pump. I doubt the std water pump was designed to
move water 12 ft to the front and back again . Rabbit, Golfs etc only have to
contend with 2 ft or so to the radaitor. Any help would be much appreciated.
PS I live in the Northwest and it doesnt get hot here! The conversion works
very well. I change the axle ratio to std aircooled and kept the CIS
injection. Plenty of power and excellent MPG (20-25).
