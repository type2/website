Subject: Re: aux oil cooler as heater core?


&gt; &gt;Here's a silly idea I just had, knowing nothing about these issues: If
&gt; &gt;a watercooled engine pumps coolant through a heater core, could the
&gt; &gt;same be done to provide heat from an auxilliary oil cooler on an
&gt; &gt;aircooled engine?  Why or why not?  Is it simply because no-one ever

JC WhipMe sells such a beast.  it's an oil cooler with long lines, a 
heat exchanger, and blower for the interior.
&gt; 
and Tim S. added: 
&gt; The diesel vanagon and 2.1l wasserboxers all have a very small water to oil 
&gt; heat exchanger neatly fitted between the oil filter and block, the filter 
&gt; now screws into the xchanger instaed of the block. 

many other VWs use these and Audis too.  should be a bunch of them
in the bone yards.  i don't think one will pull too many BTUs  off
them based on eyeballing the surface area of the exchanger, however.
 i think they are installed on the engines to pull down the oil
temps just a few degrees which is all that's really needed in many 
cases.
