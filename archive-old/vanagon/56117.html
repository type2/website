Subject: Re: Bike Racks

We have a front mount rack on our Westy...one of those arc shaped jobs
that clamps to the bumper. Have used this on previous and current
Westys, long and short trips, smooth and bumpy roads. It has worked for
us...isn't in the way for access or clearance and no problems from bumpy
road caused dents. I use those web belt/buckle tie-downs to cinch them
in place and cables with locks when appropriate. The only down side is
possible hinderance of the headlights but for us it is minimal (don't do
that much night driving). Kit Carter 85 Westy GL
