So Seamus Padraic Ragan says:
&gt; 
&gt; hello-
&gt; I have an 86' GL that is having some strange problems.  All was
&gt; well until the fuel pump went.  Since then I have begun to
&gt; develop a problem.  After replacement of the fuel pump i
&gt; ventured out towards virginia and 400 miles later i broke
&gt; down.  I was going slow at the time and the engine sputtered
&gt; and stalled.  fortunately i was able to coast into a rest stop.
&gt; 	after about 30 minutes and a mind full of worry i went
&gt; to assess the problem.  Nothing was obvious, so i tried to
&gt; start it , and it started right, running very smoothly.
&gt; Unfortunately, i was fooled by this apparent miracle and about
&gt; 60 miles later the same thing happend.  Again it started back
&gt; up after only a short time sitting.  

The problem you're having sounds to me like the same problem the
rest of us with water-cooled vanagons have only yours sounds more
accute.  For the rest of us, this stalling/hesitation problem only 
occures maybe once or twice a year.  I'll bet that yours is some
kind of intermittent short in the wiring harness or possibly in
the black box circuitry.  I'd check the harness connection at
the black box and look closely for shorted wire or solder in
that area.  I've heard more than once that that has been the culprit
to the mystery hesitation.  If you don't find anything where the
harness is connected to the box, then check the other ends of each
wire for the same or similar type problems or for loose connections
that might be causing an open circuit.  If you find nothing on that
check then you'll have to look at the black box.  Disconnect the
battery ground wire, remove all the junk to gain access to the box
and remove the harness to it.  Remove the box and set up a good ESD
(Electro-static Discharge] station so you don't screw up any components
and start looking for cold solder joints or obviously burned components.
As others on the list have mentioned before, you may have trouble replacing
the components and you may have to scrounge the wrecking yards for spares
or a complete new black box.

Hopefully, it's just a bad solder connection or a stray wire causing the
intermittent stall.

Good Luck and let us know how it goes.
