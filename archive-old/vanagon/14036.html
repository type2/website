Subject: Car Show visit...

Went to the Houston Auto Show yesterday to check out the current crop
(getting ready to get another Tall Thing, as we called the search that
culminated in our '90 Vanagon GL).

Went to the VW display first.  The only Eurovan there was the camper model.
The rep said that VW will be bringing only 1500 more of the '95 model into
the country &quot;to hold them over&quot;.  Then the '96 models will hit, with the
VR6, dual airbags and dual sliding doors...

We can wait.

Any clue on which models will get the turbo-diesel?

Noticed that the full-sized Ford van has mimiced the Vanagon's A/C layout,
with a duct running the length of the center of the roof, starting in the
left rear.  The Ford version is much lower-profile and is covered with the
cheap headliner material.

Also got a look at the Rialta motorhome.  It's pretty slick.  The &quot;pop-in&quot;
bathroom is clever, but it uses up three of the five square feet of floor
space (when the beds are made).
