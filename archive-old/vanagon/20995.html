Subject: EV Manual Update....


Called Bentley yesterday.....asked about the availability of the
EV manual. Response...January 96. Hmmmmm....after digging deep into
my brain cell I seem to recall the answer in April 93 was &quot;January
94&quot;....and in January 1994 the answer was &quot;January 95&quot;. I was
once again put on the &quot;list&quot; to be advised when the manual was
ready!

I'm waiting for VWUS to get back to me....
