Hello-
Had similar problems with my '80 Westi, rebuilt starter, rebuilt 
alternator, changed ignition switch, intermittent problem continued.  
Latest solution is to install solenoid as outlined in Muir's book.  
Still had problem, chucked that solenoid and got a good one.  No 
problems since.  Overheating of starter was suspected, but had 
circuitry checked with good results.
BTW, I attached the solenoid to the upper starter hold-it-together 
screw with the starter removed, convenient location.

&gt; My 91 GL has had a starting problem I'm wondering if any of you can solve.
&gt; This has gone on in varying degrees for the last three years.  It seems to
&gt; happen after the engine has been turned off for a short time.  Then when I
&gt; turn the key to start it there is either:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Nothing, just a click when I turn the key.  After three or four tries it
&gt; will start fine.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Turns over slowly like the battery is bad.  After a couple of tries it
&gt; will start fine.
&gt; 
&gt; The battery is new and the starter is new.  All connections have been
&gt; checked and appear to be OK.  Any thoughts?????
