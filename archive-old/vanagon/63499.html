Subject: A Stretching Clutch Cable?
Date: Wed, 6 Aug 1997 08:22:20 -0700

	In my '79 Westphalia, I notice that on hot days (I swear this
doesn't happen in cooler weather!) after driving and the engine getting
hot, the clutch cable will grow too loose, making it grind when I try to
go into reverse.  I'll crawl under and tighten it, everything seems
fine, and then a few days later the same thing will happen.

	The weird thing is this:  I've had the cable replaced recently,
same problem. AND, it can be really bad on a hot day, grinding when I
try to get it into gear, but if I leave it be and drive it the next day,
it's fine, not too loose at all.

	If it's just a stretching cable, why would it be out of
adjustment one day and then not the next?  And what the heck could the
hot day have to do with it?
