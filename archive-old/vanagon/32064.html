Subject: Re: Trinkets (T-shirts) + VW ads

The postings related to VW ads and the T-shirt posting sparked my memory
of a Xmas gift I had made for my older sister a few years back. Both of
our first cars were Bugs (hers = rebuild by pop, w/new floors &amp; bright
yellow paint; mine=$125 wonder w/no floors &amp; &quot;Butch Lankford&quot; stenciled
on the roof), though only I have remained faithful to VW.
 
But she loved her bug, and when I saw the VW ad I got the idea to make a
T-shirt from it.
 
The ad was a multi-page insert in Newsweek, or some similar mag. The front
page was white with a small (1&quot; diameter) VW logo and the caption &quot;If this
makes you think small, think again.&quot; Then, there were ads for, I dunno, GTIs
or something. The back cover of the insert had a large (8&quot; ?) logo, and the
caption &quot;Now what do you think of Volkswagen?&quot;
 
I had the small logo &amp; caption printed as a crest on the front of the T-shirt,
and the large logo printed on the back. Logo = blue, caption = black ink.
It was pretty cheap, but the shirt looked pretty legit.
 
The shirt/ad makes even more sense to those of us who drive our super-roomy
busses. Maybe replace the rear ad with a picture of your own steed...
