          I just called these guys this morning.  Guess they didn't like
          the sound of my voice as they charged me $15.71 for an '84 manual
          and an 86 Camper supplement.

     Oops!  It wasn't your voice; it's the shipping charge I forgot to
     mention (I gulped too, and then ordered a couple of other manuals to
     spread this out).

          They had no 84 or 85 Camper supplements.  The woman I spoke with
          also did not recognize or comprehend &quot;Westfalia Supplement.&quot;  Her
          computer refers to &quot;Camper Supplements.&quot;

     Hey - I talked to that wonderful person (read: clueless wonder) the
     first time, too.  Later, I called back (with the VW number for the
     &quot;Camper&quot; supplement for my '91) and got a different person who knew
     what a Westfalia was.  At least the &quot;CW&quot; is catching on.
