&gt; to my garage. This shouldn't be too difficult according to the

&gt; with two people into a car and mounting and remounting it using
&gt; a simple hydraulic jack. What is the weight of such an  engine  ??

on my 1980 vanagon i removed, rebuilt and reinstalled my engine as a one
man job.  I have a floorjack with a big sadle so the engine balanced on
there very nicely.  I merely dropped it down, pulled it on the jack into
the garage, and removed the heads.  With the heads off i could lift and
move it by myself.  Put it back on the jack, reinstalled the heads, and
wheeled it on out to bolt back in.

dunno if everyone would want to do it as a one man job, if it falls of
the jack with the heads still attached or comes down unbalanced you could
break something (possibly yourself, ouch!) but it worked just fine for
me...  The first time i did it i had help frm another local busperson
(thanks sami)

peace,

Steve
