	John Alexander wonders:
Now can anybody tell me if the back door from a 71' Westfalia will fit in a
65' Panel Van?

	John- check your West Coast Metric or Bus Stop catalog-
are the seals the same (They do span the 'model' change- apparently
the back hatch was changed in the mid 60s and again in the mid 70s, but
the 67 and 68 have the same rear hatch.) If the seals are the same, good
bet the metal's interchangable. But do check the hinge location too!


	Dean Aukes wonders what he'll need to transplant FI
to his '73... Dean, from my 71 914 (1.7FI) experience, you'll
need everything above the long block- in other words, from the
intake ports on the cylinders up. AND the electric fuel pump,
AND you'll have to plumb a return line to your tank- its
a pressure fuel system, so the pump pumps against a pressure
relief valve and that valve returns the 'extra' back to the
tank. I can send you a schematic if you want, or look at
the FI service schematics for the later breadloafs. You'll need
all of it.

	Cheers!
	Bill
