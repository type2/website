Subject: Rumor of the day

&gt;&gt;&gt;There is a virus on America Online being sent by E-Mail. If you get
&gt;&gt;&gt;anything called &quot;Good Times&quot;, DON'T read it or download it.  It is a 
virus &gt;&gt;&gt;that will erase your hard drive.  Be sure to share this with 
others.  It &gt;&gt;&gt;may help them a lot.

This may be old news or totally worthless, but I thought I would forward it. 
Let the buyer beware.
