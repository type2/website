This is from the Feb 95 issue of one of those VW speciality magazines
(I just can't remember which one, cuz I ripped out the page):

HIGH-TECH QUAD INSTRUMENT GUAGE

Auto Avionics has utilized its Aerospace and Indy Car application 
experience to produce their 3-1/8-in. Quad System.  Utilizing
electronic and thermocouple senders, the quad shown is designed for 
air-cooled applications where cylinder head temperature is required.  
Auto Avionics also offers over 100 different guage combinations that
are available in 2-1/4-in. single and dual configurations, along
with matching speedometers and tachometers for air and water cooled
applications.  For more information about this and other products
offered by Auto Avionics write to P.O. Box 3055, Dept. HVW's,
Monterey, CA  93942-3055; or call 1.800.334.4913.

They show a picture of this quad, and it is SUPER NEATO!!!, although
it may take some time to get used to reading it.  It's 4 indicators
within one circle, white print, black background.  As on hour positioning
on a clock, the volts are at about 11-1, the oil temp about 2-4,
the cylinder head temp at about 5-7, and the oil press. at about
8-10.  I REALLY like the idea of having all that info in one such
small space.  

Sorry, don't have ANY idea about the cost.  If someone is interested
enough to call this place, would they kindly list here any price
info they happen to find out?
