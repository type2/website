&gt;&gt;I'm installing oil pressure and temp gauges and need to get one more gauge
&gt;&gt;to fill a 3-gauge cluster. What's the most useful/interesting gauge to have
&gt;&gt;after oil pressure and temperature?

&gt;I'd say that an ammeter would be my third preference, so that you can keep an
&gt;eye on the charging system.  But..... given that you need to run some really
&gt;big wires quite a ways to accomplish this, I'll be opting for a voltmeter in
&gt;the near future when I add gages to my van.  A voltmeter doesn't give you
&gt;quite the information of the ammeter, but it's a whole lot easier to install
&gt;- especially the way a Vanagon is wired.
&gt;
&gt;Good luck,

When I was planning for gauges for my '89 Synchro, I thought I needed
an Ammeter. But then I talked to a fellow at the VDO plant in the US
who convinced me that you could learn to read the charging system
with the voltmeter and save the grief of the ammeter installation.
