&gt; It's really too bad that the air-cooled had to be dropped.  That,
&gt; itself, is the real problem with the current VW, IMHO.
&gt; 

Those are some very true words my friend.

I've been tempted so say something for a good while:

Something very sad happened to VW in the end of the 70's.  

They lost (though not their own fault entirely) the very enginuity 
that rose them to the top.  They gave up the proven air-cooled engine.
(Let's have a moment of silence)

Based on the experiences shared by members with Vanagon's and EV's, I 
could never be corageous enough to consider one of these as a primary 
driver.

The problems shared by many members describe inherent design flaws 
with the wasserboxer, which would make anyone moving from an air-
cooled VW to a water-based one shiver!  

Before I get torched, I will admit that my air-cooled engine isn't 
perfect either.  No heat, no cool are problems that a water-cooled 
engine fix, but at what cost?

Admittedly my '57 is more of a toy than a real driver, but I drove 
that '67 every day, 50 miles a day for two year with nary a problem 
other than standard mainainence.

I'll again silently remain an air-cooled only Vdubber...
