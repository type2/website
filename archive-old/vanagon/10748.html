&gt; &gt; The suspect:  Blown oil cooler seal.
&gt; &gt; Now, how much would a new oil cooler run me?  Gasket set?
&gt; &gt; I presume that the engine must be removed in order to 
&gt; &gt; perform this service.  Correct?  ('74 II) 
&gt; 
&gt; I'll let some of the type IV people give you the particulars,
&gt; but unless you get the thing out and find holes in the cooler,
&gt; you should only have to do the seals (Just did them on my '71)

The oil cooler on the type IV engine is a pressed aluminum plate 
affair and can spring leaks along the joints between plates. I had 
the one on my '78 replaced with a used one by Bill Cheesebourg here 
in Tucson. They did it without dropping the engine by taking off as 
much of the fan shrouding as possible and reaching in with double 
jointed hands and wrenches.
       Unfortunately, the replacement cooler only lasted about a year
 before it started leaking. I also blew out a Fram :-(  oil filter at 
the same time. I suspect my oil pressure relief plungers may have 
been sticking. I got the one out at the bottom of the engine and 
cleaned it, but I never could get the one out at the front front of 
the engine that really regulates the oil pressure. Has anyone ever 
done this?
