Subject: one more tire question...yeah right!

What is the diameter of a 185 R 14 tire?

What is the diameter of a 195/75 r 14 tire?

What is the diameter of a 185/70 r 14 tire?

What is the diameter of a 185/75 r 14 tire?

I have two 185 R 14's and 2 185/75 r 14's on my van on opposite sides, in 
opposite corners!  Might this tend to make my van handle funny?

A local dealer called and has the following tres in 185 R 14... which one 
doyoyu think is best? (this is the size printed in my van)

michelin mx $96.00

Bridgestone d rated 8 ply $88.00

Merit 8 ply $57.95

He sez the &quot;mx&quot; is the offspring of the &quot;xzx&quot;.
