Thom, 

I had a similar problem with my '68 bug.  Though my problem is not likely
to be directly applicable to your bus, it may be a corollary problem.  In
the '68 the brakes would come on with a push of the pedal, but when I let
off, only the front set released.  I found out that in the early dual
circuit bugs, there was a check valve in the MC to keep the system from
collapsing if one circuit failed.  The valve had failed and was preventing
fluid from returning.  Perhaps a bit of crud is sitting somewhere in your
brake system and acting like a check valve.  That is, when you step on the
brake, the pressure forces it out of the way and fluid flows normally, but
when the fluid trys to return, this crud stops it. I fear this means total
disassembly and cleaning, but at least it looks like your brakes have
failed *on* as opposed to the other way.  (One of the nicest things about
air brakes is that they fail on.) Good luck and let me know if you find
anything.
