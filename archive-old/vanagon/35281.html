It is possible, but it's a major pain.  You will have to remove the
upper tin pieces to get at the eight upper cylinder head bolts, and to
do that you will have to remove the fuel injection.  I have not worked
on a FI bus engine so I don't know how hard this is, but I'm sure it's
not easy.  I'd estimate you would pay a professional mechanic at least 6
hours of labor to retorque the heads.
