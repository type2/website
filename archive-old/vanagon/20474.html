Subject: RE:I finally got a VW Thing ('74)


Martha....

I just thought of something. As you know I bought a brand new Thing
back in June of 1974.....and sold it some 200k miles and 10 years
later....

The following is VERY...VERY IMPORTANT!!! When you finally get your
Thing and have to put in that very first tank of gas, make sure
that PRIOR to filling the tank, you get a 12 ounce can of cola...
preferably warm. Before you start pumping your fuel, pop the
top of the cola, let it sit for about 5 minutes....or take
the can home, open it, and let it stay open while you drive
back to the gas station.

Remove the gas cap, pour the cola into the fuel tank...and then
begin pumping your gas veeeeerrrryyyyy sloooooowwwwly...while
the fuel is pumping, pop open your engine lid.

Once you have filled the tank. Start the engine and let it idle
for no more than 3 minutes...and no less than 3 minutes...yep
that would make it exactly three minutes. Make sure you have a
watch with a second hand...and not a second hand watch ... to
time this part of the proceedure.

Shut the engine off. Close the engine lid, and then drive off.
Drive your 181 for 5 miles varying the speed from 20 to 40 then
down to 30 then up to 50, then back to 40 and finally up to
60.

At this point you will find that your 181 will run so much better...
because as we used to say back in 1974....&quot;THINGS go better with
COKE!!!&quot;





GOTCHA!!
