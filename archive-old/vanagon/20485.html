Subject: RE: I finally got a VW Thing ('74)!

        Martha:
        
        Welcome to the Thing Show!  I have affectionately named our 73 
        &quot;The Money Pit.&quot;  Even so, they can be a fun vehicle.  Glad your 
        search is over.
        
        Peace,
        Skip
        
        P.S. My wife refers to my interest in all sorts of old VWs as 
        &quot;male menopause.&quot;
