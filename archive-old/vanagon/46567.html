&gt;
&gt;I JUST BOUGHT A 71 CAMPMOBILE,  BROUGHT IT HOME(ON A TRAILER) WILL 
NOT 
&gt;RUN. THE GUY I BOUGHT IT FROM RAN IT HOT (HOT ENOUGH TO MELT SEALS 
AROUND 
&gt;PLUG WIRES) THE ENGINE STILL TURNS FREELY,BUT HOW MUCH DAMAGE 
COULD THERE 
&gt;BE?,,I MEAN, WHAT SHOULD I LOOK FORWARD TO.. WHAT SHOULD I DO 
FIRST ,, 
&gt;TRY TO START THE ENGINE OR JUST TAKE IT OUT AND REBUILD IT?? 
&gt;
&gt;ANY COMMENTS AND SUGESTIONS WOULD BE HELPFUL..
&gt;
&gt;                                           RICHARD


Well the first thing you could try is to let go of that shift 
key!!!
