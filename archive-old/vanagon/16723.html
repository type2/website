&gt;I don't know if i'd say 'troll'...not really sure what that means.

Troll (n)  1) A small monster that waits under bridges, demanding payment for
           crossings or eating passers-by.  2) An older gay man, especially one
           who persistently hits on younger men.  3) A post to a newsgroup
           or mailing list intended to generate a long chain of follow-ups.
           Some folk make a game of this, intending to see who can generate
           the largest number of replies.
