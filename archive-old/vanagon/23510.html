&gt;Hi Y'all,
&gt;
&gt;I have an 84 Vanagon with a leaky windshield,  I knew it had a leak
&gt;but did not realize how bad it was until I washed the Van the other
&gt;day and the radio got wet.  
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Any quick remedies?

        Hi Jim

        When ever I install a new window, I Run a beed 
        of clear RTV under the lip of the window seal,
        from the out side, if ya get messy, excess RTV can be
scraped off with a blade.

        This may work only temporary in this case,
        You may have a rust hole in this area too.
