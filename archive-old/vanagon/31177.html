Subject: RE: Strange Bus Behavior


&gt;On the way to work this AM, going down 50, my bus kinda started losing
&gt;power.  It couldn't quite get up to its cruising speed, and when I went
&gt;up small hills, it lost speed, and didn't pick it up on the downside!

Sounds like carb ice to me, Thom. Got that &quot;third heater hose&quot; that
plugs into the sheet metal just to the right of the pulley, and goes to
the bottom of the air cleaner intake spout? It's there to prevent such
ice buildups. Is the rocker air valve also still in place in the air
cleaner spout, and moving freely?

Or, might also be a fuel pump on its last legs.

Good luck...
