Subject:       Visit my '57 Deluxe WWW Shrine!

Well, per the requests of those parties interested in the purchase of 
my Bus (outlook of sale is decreasing), I've finishsed the website.

Keep in mind I did it all this morning, from editing the photos to 
putting it all together.  I imagine there'll be a couple problems.

Anyhow, feel free to visit it on my webserver:

http://fpc99.law.utah_dot_edu

or

htpp://fpc99.law.utah_dot_edu/bus/bus.htm

This is running on my computer here at work under WinNT.  It 
should be up most of the time, but on the occasion that something 
blows up... well, you know!

Anyhow, I just wanted to show the bus off, since no one on the list 
lives in the SLC, Utah area!  &lt;grin&gt;

Apologies for the shameless ad!

Also, lastly a question for the guru's out there:

Has anyone on the list successfully installed one of the '68+ two-
stage master cylinders on a pre '67 bus?  I'm very interested in 
details!
