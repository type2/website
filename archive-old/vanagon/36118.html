Subject: FS- Hard to find parts for Bugs, Busses, and Ghias

I recently purchased a convertible Ghia project, so I ,once again, am 
trying to sell some of my extra parts. I have owned at least 25 Vintage
VW's over the years and have lots of extra parts for Bugs, Busses, and 
Ghias. Please help a fellow aircooled addict out, all of the parts are 
original, German parts, fairly priced and guaranteed. Please E-mail if 
interested.
