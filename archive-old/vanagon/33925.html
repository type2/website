I was doing some re-design of my web pages tonight (because I have no life)
and I came across the picture of my '67 bus all burned up, the one that
the story was about.  I was looking at it, and it dawned on me that a lot of
those parts are still in circulation!

The tranny went into my friend's '59
The headlights are on the '56
The door handles went to Lee Griffiths
The Mirrors went to Markus Benne.
The steering box went to who-knows-who, 
  cause it was stolen after I pulled it out.
The engine (what was left) went as a core against the motor for the '56
The Front door windows went to the '56
The windshields were given to another friend, along with the bumper
The hubcaps are on the '56
The seats are in the back yard (anyone need a 60/40 front seat set?)

Kinda put a new perspective on it, seeing as how prolly 10-15% of the bus
is still alive and kicking...
