Subject: RE: '71 Westy On Fire! (what went wrong?)


&gt;What happened: Yesterday I was continuing with my slow job of replacing the 

&gt;wiring under the dash that the PO was so proud of - he did it all himself!
&gt;Nevermind that all of the connections were simply twisted together - no 
wire
&gt;nuts, no soldering - and no electrical tape
    &lt;snip&gt;
&gt;The wierd thing is that although the ground to the stereo was completely
&gt;fried, I couldn't find anything positive in the area that it could have
&gt;grounded to - the ignition was off, and investigating with a test light
&gt;turned up nothing in the vicinity


In older bugs, the unswitched hot wire from the battery, first goes to
the headlight switch, and then to the ignition. I wonder if this is the
case with your bus?

In my '71 bus, I cooked a wire while fiddling with the radio. In my case,
it was because the fuse box was rattling around loose rather than being
firmly mounted to a bulkhead or whatever. When I pushed at a group of
wires, the fuse box moved enough that one of its contacts, touched metal.

Hope some of this helps-- an electrical fire can ruin your whole day (isn't
20/20 hindsight wonderful?).
