Remember that our next outing is coming up soon - Jan. 17-19 in
the Tahoe area, near Homewood.  We'll be at the family cabin of
list member Jeffrey Carver and family (thanks!), and I'll post
directions ahead of the date, so you'll know how to get there.

Please remember that this is a no-smoking facility.

Also, in light of recent weather conditions, I suggest you all
consider renting or buying chains or cables for your vehicles.  I
bought a set at Auto Parts Club for about $20, which I thought was
very reasonable.

Closer to the date, I'll post again the info Jeff kindly provided me
with concerning the cabin's amenities and nearby possible activities.

Here's a list of those proposing to attend:

Coyote Ron Lussier and Dan
Bradley Prunehead
Sam Williams
Eugene Palmer
me, etc.
Ann Prunehead
Sky Greenawlt
Dave Kautz and family
Steve/Linda Johnsons
Jack Stafford?
Joel Walker?
Kathy Myers/Mark Blanchard?
Wagners?
Holsers?
Bren Smith?

Cost, as mentioned before, will not be prohibitive.  We're all splitting
the approx $80 snow plow fee.  If it snows heavily, we may have to
go for this a second round.  Plus, there will be a utility charge of
$10 per person, which covers your stay for the weekend.  Even though
this weekend may be a 3 day one for some of you, our stay will be
Friday and Saturday evenings.

At the last outing, a motion was made for an Asian culinary theme,
which I think sounds great.  This of course includes many countries -
Japan, China, Thailand, Burma, etc, and should open up a lot of
possibilities.  We'll talk more about the potluck contributions as
the time gets closer, but if anyone wants to sign up now, please feel
free to do so.

More later...
