&gt;However, both places contain some of the most beautiful locations on the
&gt;planet and NZ has the friendliest people I've ever run across.  In fact, I

Hopefully y'all think that there are some of the &quot;friendliest people&quot; in
Arizona also! Contact me when traveling through **in a VW with insurance **
and I'll prove it. In fact, please bring the ice cold Dominion Bitter Double
Brown with you and I'll provide the Mexican food! =)
