Subject: a delayed thanks

I want to thank the several people who have been helping me while the list
was down.  I got the engine (rebuilt) back into the van and it wouldn't
start because there was no spark.  After trying everything for days, and a
lot of help, my wife got back from a family reunion, studied the wiring
diagrams for a while, and discovered that the wire I had going to the oil
sensor really went to ground.  Started right up.

However, the oil light still doesn't work.  I found the wire that really
goes to the sensor.  If I hook it up, nothing.  If I ground it, the light
comes right on.  The sensor is new.  Do I need a different new one?  How do
I test it?

Thanks,
Bill			(Bill_at_freeholder_dot_com)
