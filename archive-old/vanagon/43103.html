Wow!

Hey friends....

You wouldn't believe...uh..strike that...maybe you would....Anyway, on the way 
back to Santa Rosa from San Francisco today (I drive a bread route)I caught a 
glimpse of the most amazing thing:  No, it wasn't a Thing, but it sure was 
wierd!  

This particular beastie looked to be a breadloaf bus, garishly painted (looked 
good!) with the top of a Bug welded on.....rear first, and all windows intact.  
This strange creation whizzed by the other direction to quickly for me to get a 
good look, but from what I could see, it was cool!  

If somebody knows of this, or if the owner is on the list, tell us what you've 
done!
