&gt;Anyone else experienced a speedometer that ocassionally just doesn't do
&gt;its speed thing. The odometer never seems to stop, but for about the past
&gt;year and a half, it will sudenly decide it isn't going to register
&gt;anything. So far it has come back just as suddenly and will keep going

i think this is the Infamous VDO Drive Gear symptoms ... supposedly, there
is a little white plastic driver gear on the odometer that breaks easily.
it is common to ALL VDO speedos, in almost all euro cars ... my sister's
Dashers had this problem and my brother's bmws. and i've heard of it in
porsche and volvo.  the story i heard was that it occurs most frequently
with people who reset the trip odometer while the car is moving. now,
obviously, if you don't have a trip odometer, that makes you wonder just a
bit. :)  but that's what i heard. and it fit the family situations. ;)

&gt;The shop that I give an absurd amount of money to says that it means the
&gt;speedometer is going out and I have to replace the whole thing some $$$
&gt;Used to be you could uncouple the drive cable and shoot some dry lube in
&gt;it, or replace a gear or two, but not any longer I am told.

lubing the cable usually only affects the fluctuating needle problem ...
where the mph/kph needle is wiggling around, or jerking from one speed to
another. the odometer/trip-odometer not working is, i think, usually related
to gears inside the speedo head ... which is nowadays harder to get into
(because of the Fed laws about resetting the odometer). but it might not hurt
to take the speedo out, grease the cable anyway, and squirt a bit of WD40 or
some such mess down into the odometer digits ... it might help.

if you are around Los Angles, there is a guy that advertises in the porsche
magazines as a repair shop for VDO stuff. United Instruments is the name
(i think ... i don't keep the porsche magazines anymore). they might be able
to replace the gear or sell you a rebuilt. also check the junk yards. but it
might bring up some paperwork problems later if you sell the car ... so keep
your receipts!
