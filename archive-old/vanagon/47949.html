Subject: Re: Dreamy New Tires &amp; Pressure Inquiry



&gt;They put 35 lbs of pressure in them.  It maxs at 50lbs.  I took 
&gt;the air pressure up to 40lbs all the way around.  Any input as to 
&gt;the optimal tire pressure on an 84 Vanagon?  

My '85 Westy has a sticker on the drivers door post (on the side 
near the front of the van) recommending 39 psi front and 48 rear, 
as I recall.
