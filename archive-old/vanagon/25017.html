Subject: Re: Kombi vs MicroBus

     John.T.C asks:
     
     &gt;What were the differences between the Type 221 (MicroBus) and the
     &gt;Type 231 (Kombi)?  It seems like a lot of people get the two confused 
     &gt;and mixed up quite a bit.
     
     Most differences are fairly subtle, the ones I know about are:
     
     Kombi                      Microbus
     
     no headlining, apart       fully headlined, including side 
     from card liner in         panels around windows
     cab roof
     
     no interior panels         fully paneled with chromed 
     in rear, plain panels      strips on two-tone panels
     in cab
     
     black steering wheel       white steering wheel
     
     black control knobs        white control knobs
     
     black vent-wing cathces    chromed vent-wing catches
     
     painted hub caps           chromed hub caps
     
     cargo area painted in      cargo area slightly! painted
     grey undercoat             in body color
     
     Basically the Kombi is a panel van with windows, and the Micro is a 
     Kombi with the extras mentioned above.
     
     Anyone know of any more differences?
     
     Lee.
