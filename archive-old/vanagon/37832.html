Subject: What Grease to use on the Steering Box? ('81)

Hello Everyone,
	I am going to replace the torn boots on my rack and pinion
steering box.  This is not power steering.  I read in Haynes that I should
grease the steering box when I replace the boots but it doesn't specify
the type of grease.  Bently doesn't mention the grease at all. What grease
have you used for this application? 

	Thank You.
