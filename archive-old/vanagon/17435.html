Subject: Q on 84 vanagon
Date: Fri, 12 May 1995 12:59:07 -0400 (EDT)

Todays paper had an add saying 84 vw vanagon camper, beautiful, runs great, no 
rust 1200 obo.  Well it sounds to good to be true.  Probally a miss print, but 
as soon as I get a hold of the owner I will know.  I am an aircooled person 
and don't know much about these waterpumpers.  Any suggestions on questions to 
ask the owner about certain problems it might have.  Are the rust areas in the 
same place and older buses.  I know it says no rust but in Ohio I think that is
har d to believe.  Any info appreciated.
Thanks
Brad
