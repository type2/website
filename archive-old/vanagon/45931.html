Subject: help with brakes in NC?

Having just purchased my &quot;new&quot; vanagon, I'm somewhat low on cash.  I'd 
like to replace the rear brake components and, though I've done some work 
on brakes before, I could still use some assistance from someone more 
experienced.  I've never bled a brake system or replaced wheel cylinders 
before.

So, is there anyone out there who might be willing to assist me in 
exchange for some refreshments and the joy of working on a VW?

Oh, I could do this in the Baltimore/DC area also if there are any takers 
(or anywhere in between).

Thanks,
david
