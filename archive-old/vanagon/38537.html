Subject: Vanagon Engine Stabilizer

The engine/transaxle of my '85 Westy has always moved around a lot.  Even
when it was new, people would see the exhaust system wagging like the tail on
a dog and ask me if something was wrong.  It's got 121K on the clock and I've
changed ALL of the motor mounts and the front tranny mount without any
improvement.  The symptoms are surging upon gear change and then
acceleration.  I also notice it during constant slow, steady, and level
cruising.

I've thought of installing an engine stabilizer.  This is a shock absorber
like device that installs between the engine and the frame.  I first saw this
device on MotorWeek on TV.  Pat Goss installed one on his Ford Explorer.  I
guess Ford 4WD's have traditionally had soft motor mounts and problems with
the type of surging I've described.  I've also learned that an engine
stabilizer came stock on some Ford escorts and other 4 cylinder cars.

Has anybody installed one of their on their waterboxer?  Is there a product
commercially available or do I have to devise my own?  Where would you attach
it? ? ?  To the head?

Please respond me directly at DNeu_at_aol_dot_com as well as the listserver.  I've
tried, but I just can't keep up with all the great mail you people put out.
 I'll still subscribe whenever I can afford the AOL time required to download
30 pieces of mail per day.  I'll also look forward to meeting some of you on
west coast trips Ala Busgirl.
