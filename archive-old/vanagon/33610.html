Subject: Re: More on tires

&gt;I've run non-reinforced tires on my westies for 7 years with no problems at
&gt;all.  However, I have never had more than 2 or three people in it at the
&gt;same time and I don't go off-roading with it (I DO carry alot of junk
&gt;though).  They should work fine for highway driving.

My own personal data point and subjective analysis:  My Vanagon came with
6 tires, all non-reinforced.  The ride was sloppy and there was lots of
lean when cornering.  Two of the tires (don't remember brands but they were
different) had bubbles in the sidewalls and still had tread left.  My analysis
was: (a) could be indicative of non-reinforced (since the tires were
different brands), (b) if these things fail, its going to happen when I'm
in a heavy turn and it could be dangerous.

Chances are non-reinforced will not fail (as many folks are using them).
But its got to be true (speculation) that odds of non-reinforced failing
are MUCH greater than reinforced.

Finally, I bought 4 Michelin MXL's (reinforced) 205/70 and the ride is
much better -- tight cornering (for a vanagon, anyway) and less lean.
