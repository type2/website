Thanks to those who responded to our plight.   The best guess was 3-4
synchronizer hub and best advice was that it would be a challenge to attempt
myself.  

So, up for the challenge, this pm I finally finished taking the trans apart
(Part I) and found the 3-4 sychronizer hub broken. I started Tuesday am and
worked during the day!  I had to fabricate something to take the place of
the special tools required, one for the diff output shaft bearing removal,
one for the pinion shaft retaining ring and a crude hydraulic press
arrangement.     

Just back from the VW flaps.  Parts guy really was friendly and helpful.  He
tried to cut my costs by itemizing the parts in the rebuild gasket kit
($152.00 CDN) but the drive shaft output seals included in the kit alone
were $50 each!!.  The local VW parts warehouse had all the parts the trans
requires and they will be here tomorrow noon!.  The killer part was the
synchronizer hub/sleeve assembly that cost $402.00 (CDN).

I asked about synthetic trans oil at VW but he suggested I couldn't afford
it.  Maybe i'll visit the local Redline supplier.   Any one use synthetic?  

Looks like the weekend will be part II, reassembly.

Thanks again to those who offered their knowledge and experiences.  Make the
job a little easier amongst friends.
