So vanman_at_write_dot_com says:
&gt; together a little power converter (inverter?) circuit to change the
&gt; 12V DC to the 110AC. Draws about 360 watts on super high (12VDC 30
&gt; Amps) and 120 watts on low (12VDC 10 Amps).
&gt; 
&gt; If enough of you want, I could slap together a crude schematic and
&gt; post it on the group. Or email me and I can do the same. I've had it
&gt; for a couple years and when I built it, it cost somewhere around $30.
&gt; You can also buy one from J.C. Whitney though I don't remember the
&gt; price. I also ran a heavier wire directly to the battery (yes, with an
&gt; inline fuse) so as not to fry any wiring. Just playing it safe.
&gt; 

Post it!  I know at least one other flannel wearing person that's
got to be interested in this.  BTW, How well would this set up
work cycling on and off during those cold camping nights with
an auxilary battery?

Thanks,

Steven
