(whining)Waaahhhhhh, this is not good news to me as I am looking to buy a '96 EV 
camper in about a year. Thought that by then they would be having a terrific 
sale as the '97's rolled out. Talked to a dealer in San Francisco yesterday and 
he said that no dealers in SF would get the EV's and that I had to go to Walnut 
Creek (about 45 mins away) to even try to get one. He also said that they 
wouldn't be out until June. This blows me away. You'd think we were trying to 
get a copy of the ebola virus or something:(.
