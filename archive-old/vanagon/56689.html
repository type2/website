I am looking to buy the left side folding table from a
Carat/Multivan/Wolfsburg edition. This is the table that attaches with
hinges directly below the sliding window on the driver side wall, and is set
up by pushing in on the table top near the floor which activates the spring
release. When it is pulled out and up into the &quot;set up&quot; position, a wire rod
underneath and parallel to the table top springs back into the side wall,
thus enabling it to lock into place without the use of a table leg. When
folded against the side wall in the vertical position, it fits neatly into a
grey molded plastic trim panel made to accommodate the table. I am
interested in the table and all associated attachment hardware.
