It's posted with the FAQ about every two weeks to the air-cooled VW group.

It's also listed at the main vanagon and Air-cooled web sites.  I've also
seen references to it at several others individual web sites as well as
some directories.

&gt; 3.  The list explodes
&gt; 
&gt; Sure, I would like everyone with a type II VW to be on this list, but it
&gt; just isn't practical.  I think we get plenty of new subscribers without
&gt; advertising on the web.  See, I'm greedy.  I want this resource.  I
&gt; have made a lot of friends on this list, and if it went away for
&gt; whatever reason, I would be devastated.  I'd rather not take a chance on
&gt; it going out of control like one of Bradley's campfires.  My two cents.

I'm not worried about the list exploding, I'm worried about Gerry S. imploding...
