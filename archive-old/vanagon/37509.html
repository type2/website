&gt;&gt;&gt;Couldn't we hook something up so I could deal with all
&gt;&gt;&gt;those minivan  drivers who cut me off while talking on their
&gt;&gt;&gt;cell phones?

&gt;&gt;Sounds good to me. Unfortunately, the surplus gun turrets
&gt;&gt;from all those WWII bombers, are pretty much sold out by
&gt;&gt;now...
&gt;
&gt;Maybe Q from James Bond's technical department could come
&gt;up with something.  Could use it here too.

The frame is strong enough to mount a side dump fork lift on the front?
