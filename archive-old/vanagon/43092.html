Subject: rolling again...

Finally got the '90 GL running again after replacing the clutch, pressure
plate, throwout bearing, flywheel, CV boots, shocks (with KYB gas-a-just),
air filter and temp sensor o-ring.  Seems to be doing okay - took it on a
600 mile trip right away.

A little excitement on the trip:

Cruising along at 70mph, a red plastic gasoline container appears in front
of me in the road.  Probably fell from a boat on a trailer that was the
next vehicle ahead.  It headed toward my right as I tried to adjust left.
Didn't want to swerve to hard at that speed...

WHAM!
(followed by) long, continuous abrasive noise

Look in the mirrors - no red shapes, but a large cloud of grey/white smoke.
It's stuck somewhere underneath.  My wife is panicing.  I'm waiting for the
Hollywood ball of flames.

Try to instantly decide which is better -
keep going until it's dislodged - the 100+ ft/sec airflow will keep the
flames from toasting one point more than any other; or
stop and pry it loose.

Took option one with a modifier - the area to the right of the pavement was
graded for repaving - I got into the dirt and hoped that the uneven
(relatively) surface would dislodge the foreign object.  After a couple of
hundred yards it worked.  A blackened lump appeared behind me just after
the noise ended.

An inspection moments later turned up fine spatters of black, melted
plastic sprayed around the inside of the right front wheel well.  It must
have jammed in there and had the tire rubbing on it all that way.

I'm sure glad that it didn't get stuck under the gas tank...
