Subject:      STUFF FS (addendum 2)

hi volks,

a couple items gone and a couple items added...

gotta make room in the garage and raise some $$ to finish the '60 resto.
make an offer on any of the stuff below:

1) semi-auto tranny for '68 and up beetle, complete and in good shape
2) various 40hp engine parts - inquire
3) stale air heater boxes and bus muffler from a 40hp, surface rust but
no holes and tight. i used it earlier in the year and there are no
leaks!
4) '85 vanagon wasserboxer 1.9L longblock in need of head gaskets but
otherwise good
5) auto tranny from '85 vanagon wasserboxer in good shape
6) am/fm blaupunkt radio in ec from '85 vanagon
7) front and cargo area rubber mat for vanagon
8) stale air shroud and tin from 40hp

*the bumper and screen have already sold*

i'll be cleaning out the garage again tonight so expect another addendum
tomorrow :-)
