Subject: Retorque Heads?

Hello Everyone,
	I have had the heads rebuilt on my '81 Westy this winter and I
have installed the heads and reinstalled the engine.  I had some trouble
getting it running at first, but every thing in the engine seems to be
working now.  It runs well, good compression, and starts reliablely.  I
have driven it less than three hundred miles and will be doing the first
oil change soon, I want to get an oil temp sender to install at the same
time.  It is parked now while I make other repairs.
	I am still a greenhorn and I know just enough to screw myself and
my van.  (Like reinstalling the thermostat only to find that it is not
contracting when cold, that is failed flaps closed.) I can not find
anything in Bentley, Haynes or Muir about retorqueing the heads.  Is it
possible to do this with out dropping the engine?  I can see getting
access to the lower head nuts but the upper nuts are under the tin. 
	Any help will be welcomed.
	Thank You.
	johnny Stutsman
