Subject:       Westy fresh water tank gauge

Hi Everyone.  In the past week, I have found that my water gauge is 
not responding correctly in my '90 Westy.  When filling the tank, the gauge would be 
in the &quot;red&quot; until full.. skipping the &quot;yellow&quot; zone entirely and 
going straight to &quot;green&quot;

While using water, the gauge stayed in the &quot;green&quot; forever, and 
briefly went to &quot;yellow&quot;, and then to &quot;red&quot;.  It seems to be 
sticking.  I have removed the float and slid the magnetic ring along 
the float, and the gauge responds correctly.  Fill it up with water, 
and it sticks again.  

I made sure the pump isn't touching the float (not even sure if it is 
possible), but I checked it anyway.  

Ideas??  Could the float ring be taking in water and making it 
heavier than it should be?  Should I wash the float with baking 
soda??  I wash out my tank by hand with baking soda every spring.  
The wires leading to the float seem good... I have them zip-tied so 
they don't twist and get tangled.  Would the zip-ties cause problems 
on such small wires??

Anybody heard or experienced such a problem before?  A new float is 
around $160-$180 CDN.

Thanks for the help
Harry.
