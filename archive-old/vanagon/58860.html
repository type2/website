regarding EVC interiors: although the pad is certainly thinner, the rear
seat in the '95 is flat, so its not lumpy. Just hard because the pads are
so thin.
(Or so my then-pregnant wife complained, I could sleep on it!)
And the sliding door seems fine in mine - solid and in its tracks.
I've been meaning to install shelves in there and in the mirrored cabinet,
and even have some nice pieces of plywood for that purpose, but haven't
gotten around to it yet.
I sure hate that water pump though - is the '97 pump as noisy as the '95?
(I know that it doesn't require the manual switch at least.)
I never had a Westie, but there seems to be plenty of room in the upper
bunk, and while standing - and I'm 6'4&quot;!

On a related note: I'm thinking of heading out for &quot;baby's first camping
trip&quot; this weekend, maybe take the bikes up to Deception Pass, if anyone is
interested. Depends upon the weather, but current forecast is looking good.
