So Derek Drew says:
&gt; charge about $180 or even more.
&gt; 
&gt; I had been planning to organize a mass order of the skylights--he said I
&gt; could have them for $85 if I ordered 25 of them. But I judged the bother of
&gt; organizing this with our list members not worth the trouble to save $12
&gt; minus shipping. so I am just passing on here what I learned.
&gt; 

Speaking of mass orders.  I JUST got a call from the RV guy that I ordered
the flue covers from.  He says there in.  As he is only open from 8 - 5
Mon. - Fri.  I will be picking them up on this Friday as I'll be out
running errands that morning.  So, I've recieved a few checks and will
send those flues off to those people (you know who you are) and will
send flues to the others as I recieve the checks.  This excludes those
of you that I've made prior arrangements to meet and do the exchange in
person.  

Cheers!
