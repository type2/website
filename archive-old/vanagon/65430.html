&lt;&lt; I did some measuring, and I believe that if you cut away a small section
of
 the front of the map pocket away that you can provide enough clearance so
the
 glovebox will open with the door shut. I'm going to give this a try next
 weekend, I'll let you know if it works.  &gt;&gt;

STOP!  You don't need to cut anything.  You can simply move the map pocket
back toward the rear of the van about 3-4 inches and everything works fine.
 I have two like this.
