This is a standard Golf II syncro delivered in the first years of the
Golf syncro production. The *big* lights are self-made. There are only
few Golf syncro sold with this jacked up undercarriage.  It is likely
the design VW did with the Vanagon undercarriage.

Driving around town today I came across an A2 bodied VW Golf Syncro - jacked
up ~ 6&quot; higher than normal, with  serious 'roo/brush bar assemblys front &amp;
rear, outside rear mounted spare, lotsa extra *big* lights front &amp; rear -
looked like it was all ready for Paris-Dakar !  Anybody have any info ? ?
(&amp; yes I know,where's the Vanagon thread; well, the word Syncro &amp; maybe the
fact that it's water-cooled ? ? ).
