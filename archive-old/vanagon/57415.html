Subject: re: Ron's tire FAQ

Ron-

        At least one of the two tires that you reccomend for the EuroVan are
not all season tires.  I don't know about the Nokia, but the Bridgestone
Blizzak is a high performance snow and ice tire that should not be used for
long periods of time on dry pavement.  It has a special tread compound that
is designed to sort of crumble off to give you traction in adverse
conditions.  It has a fairly short tread life as it is, and trying to use it
as an all season tire would kill it in short order.  

        The only tires I have been able to find in the EuroVan size are both
original equipment models- The Continental Contrans, which are on my van,
and are just okay; and the Goodyear G64, which are probably just okay too.
Both are expensive, so when I replace the tires on Moby this fall, I will do
some careful exploring.  My hope is to find a Toyo that will work, as there
is a local tire place here in Mass. ( Direct Tire) that offers a lifetime
warranty on Toyo tires for as long as you own the vehicle.
