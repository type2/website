 I read an interesting article on the addition of fuel oxygenators that was
 re-printed in one of the Porsche owners magazines. It explains the    
 ambiguity originally mentioned by Tobin:

 Fuel oxygenators like methanol, ethanol and MBTE are effective in older
 cars that do NOT have closed loop carburation/injection systems. The graphs
 in the article showed clear reduction in CO emissions for these types of
 vehicles. Cars with closed loop systems are measuring the oxygen content
 of the exhaust and adjusting the mixture accordingly. These systems sense
 the additional oxygen and richen the mixture, hence the complaints that the
 new &quot;winter&quot; gas reduces fuel economy.

 So, in an older vehicle without an oxygen sensor, adding an oxygenator could
 help reduce CO measured at an emissions test. In a later vehicle &lt;'81 or so&gt;
 it is unlikely to help.

 There was also considerable discussion in this article as to the corrosive
 effects of the additives being used. Their conclusion was that MBTE is 
 marginally better. However, because there are some tax credits available to 
 oil companines for using Ethanol &lt;the corn lobby?&gt; it is frequently used
 as the oxygenator even though it is more expensive to produce and an
 inferior additive.

 On a related topic, I was curious to know just how effective emissions
 control devices are and found a book that gave the federal standards that
 had to be met. The news is not good for those of you that have defeated
 your controls: At the very least - a vehicle that meets, but does not 
 exceed the standards - an early 70's car pollutes at half the rate of a 
 '60s car. A mid '70s car generates only one third the pollution of a '60s
 car. An early '80s car has it down to about one seventh and a early '90s
 cars is about one twenty-fifth. 
 
 I put the book down with the opinion that since even the simplest controls
 were having a significant effect &lt;cutting auto generated pollution by 
 50-70%&gt; that it is both reasonable and wise to maintain this equipment in
 operating condition.

 Now driving with all my hoses hooked up,

 Dave
