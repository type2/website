Subject: Re: Bentley manual costs

&gt;        I've been seeing on this list that the Bentley books for the VW
&gt;        Vanagons and Westys (1980 and up) are around $70.  Are the
&gt;        Bentley books for the older buses, like the '68-'79 book, that
&gt;        expensive?  Seems like a lot for that book, but I guess if you
&gt;        need one you need one.
&gt;
&gt;        Hopin' older is cheaper,


        Mine was around $30, so your hopes would seem well founded.

Peace,
