the stones voodoo lounge has a www site, it is  www.stones_dot_com


&gt;Remember the story about VW sponsoring the Rolling Stones' tour? Well I just
&gt;read a letter from VAG's head of PR in Autocar magazine in reply to the
&gt;ridicule they printed. He points out that the Rolling Stones owned a '63 VW
&gt;(doesn't say if it was a bus but I doubt they'd have crammed a drum kit in a
&gt;beetle) in which they undertook their first ever tour, and that Keef has
&gt;owned 'five or six' (he probably has trouble counting that high) VW buses
&gt;over the years. Well, well.
