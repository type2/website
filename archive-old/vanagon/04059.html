&gt;The isolator I used from Sure-Power controls throughput to &lt; 90A.

Throughput to 90A is not the prob. The prob is that isolators drop voltage
from 14.4 down to 13.4 which is too low for effective fast recharges of your
batteries. You can get away with an isolator, its just that it is a bad
choice for a vw van.
