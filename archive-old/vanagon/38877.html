Woohoo!

It's official, my '91 Honda Civic Hatchback is now masquerading as '71 
dual cab. You may be asking yourself, what voodoo did he do-do? Chicken 
blood, rooster feathers? Strange incantations performed under the full 
moon? Well, believe it or not all this wannabe had to do was to send a 
few dollars to Richard Palmer and voila, my Honda is now a double cab!

Get your sticker now, it'll make even a Honda look like it belongs on 
this list.

Cheers,

Bren
