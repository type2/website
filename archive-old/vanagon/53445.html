Subject: Re: lighting questions

On the switch there are 4 locations to hook a wire (A-D), 3 of are for
around 14-16 gauge (sp?) wire (A-C), while in the middle of the switch
is the light bulb or diode light which has a 18 or so gauge conector on
it (D).The Hot is in location C and the ground is B. From the the B
connector there is a strip connecting to where the diode attachment
enters the switch. 
A  B  C
   D
As far as the wiring I've done...Red wire hot coming from battery, Black
wire ground. Small grey wire (18 guage) that I spliced from the rear
defogger switch which also has a diode. Fog lights work fine, but no
diode light

any help appreciated

&gt; &gt;electrical wizard. Any advice ?

&gt; What colors are your wires?  I have one of the dealer installed switches out of
&gt; the dash right now. I also have another one of the dealer installed switches in
&gt; the dash on another vanagon I have, and the wires are the same color.
