Subject: Weld heads?

OK, so like everybody else I'm going to needs the heads repaired on my 87
Westy at some point.  I did the Bars Leaks thing and I think I can tough it
out for a while.  My mechanic (who owns an 87 Vanagon)  says heads are
needed. His solution:  Remove heads weld them at a machine shop and replace
with new gaskets.  Alternatives includes new VW heads (expensive!)  Is there
an after-market source for heads and gaskets that's good?  If so please post
the phone number of  a source.  My mechanic has welded and machined several
heads.  He says a complete rebuild is a wast of money.  His estimated cost to
machine/weld heads and replace gaskets: $1300.  His cost for a rebuilt
engine: $2500 plus installation. He's a good mechanic but charges $50 an
hour.
