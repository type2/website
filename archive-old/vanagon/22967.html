Subject: /f Avant garde composers (with VW content)

The avant-garde composer John Cage (1912-1994) is best known as a
writer of &quot;chance&quot; music; that is, elements of the composition such as
which notes to play and when and for how long are determined by rolling
dice or throwing coins as if consulting the I Ching.  
Needless to say, his music is different from that of even other
ultramodern composers, and perplexed even people who were disposed
to appreciate adventurous music.  (Short answer to the 
question &quot;Why did he use chance?&quot;:  His aim was for sounds to &quot;be 
themselves&quot; without being placed in a structure of meaning
and purpose; he wanted to eliminate the composer's ego which had likes 
and dislikes; and he was very touched by Zen, which has a 
detached, unjudgemental view of the world.)

He was also had an encylopedic knowledge of mushrooms, and gathered them
to eat.  In 1959, when he was working in the electronic music 
studio of Luciano Berio in Milan he became a contestant
on an Italian TV game show as a mushroom expert.  The format of the show was:
each week there were new, more difficult questions, and if a question 
was ever answered incorrectly, you were eliminated.  If you were 
always right, the money kept increasing for 5 weeks,
at the end of which you had 5 million lire (~$8000 (a lot of money in 1959)).

Cage, who always played one of his pieces (one of which included a rubber
fish and a Waring blender) before he went on to answer
questions, became an Italian celebrity, got mobbed in the street, little
girls sent him postcards with &quot;Buoni funghi&quot; written on them, etc.  Anyway,
he was right and right and right for the whole five weeks (the last question
was &quot;name all the white spored mushrooms,&quot;  he named them all, in 
alphabetical order) and won his money.

Now, you may ask, what's the VW content of this story?  Well when
he got back to the US he bought a Steinway piano for $2000, and for
his long-time collaborator and companion, the dancer Merce Cunningham,
he bought a VW bus for $2336.   :-)
