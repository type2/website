Subject: Re: RESULTS - Tire Survey 

There are only very minor differences between a P205/70R14 and 205/70?R14 tires.

The p-metric tires (P205/70R14) meet US/Canadian Tire &amp; Rim Associan passenger car tire 
specifications.  The milli-metric tires (205/70?R14) meet European ETRTO (and Japanese) 
specifications.

For the milli-metric tires, the ? designates the speed rating.  S is adequate for VW buses (T, H 
and V are higher speed ratings).  A 185R14 is the same as a 185SR14.

I believe that Michelin markets a reinforced 205/70SR14 tire.

A LT205/70R14 tire is for light trucks with higher load capacity.  You might want to look for 
one of these for your bus.

The five 205/7014 tires in the survey where from 5 different manufacturers and where all name 
brand.  The results where mixed, as expected.


ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT VS. REPLACEMENT
----------------------------------

Original equipment tires typically wear worse than replacement.

Original equipment tires are optimized for traction, noise, ride, handling and MPG.  Some degree 
of tread wear life is typically sacrificed to meet these parameters.

I will never buy original equipment tires for the following reasons:

  1) You really can not buy the &quot;original equipment&quot; tire for your specific vehicle.
     The tire originally supplied on your vehicle was specifically optimized for that
     vehicle, and even for just that model year.  The odds are against your being able
     to get &quot;that&quot; specific tires.  For example, you might have a P205/70R14 Firestone
     Supreme tire for a Ford Tuarus and a P205/70R14 Firestone Supreme tire for a
     Chevy Lumina.  These will not be the same tire.  You have to be able to read the
     codes pained on the tread of the tire to determine what tire you have.

  2) Some of the &quot;original equipment&quot; tires that you can buy are actually tires built
     to be sold as original equipment, but where rejected because that did not met
     customer specifications.  When a tire manufacturer builds original equipment
     tires for a customer, it knows that it has variations in production.  This means
     that a certain percentage of the tires it builds will not meet customer
     requirements.  Therefore, manufacturers have machines that measure the performance 
     characteristics of tires, right in the production line.  The better tires go to the
     vehicle manufacturers, and the rest are sold as replacement, rebranded and sold
     under a different brand name, or scrapped.

     NOTE: I do not believe that this applies to Michelin.

  3) I consider tread wear more important that ride and handling on a vehicle with
     &gt;60,000 miles on it.

I hope that I have been able to answer your questions?

&gt;Since I am buying a &quot;new&quot; '91 Westy and upgrading to the factory Alloys, I am
&gt;particularly interested in this tire survey info. I would like the specific
&gt;subset of data on the 205/70 R14 tires as this is the size specified in the
&gt;VW brochure as being appropriate for the factory Alloys.
&gt;
&gt;[Actually the brochure specifies 'P205/70 R14 tires.]
&gt;
&gt;In my own searching for tires of this particular size, I went to the TireRack
&gt;online and found 'slim pickins'. Here is what I found - I am interested in
&gt;finding out how this meshes with the survey data and anyone's personal
&gt;experience.
&gt;
&gt;Tire Rack options:
&gt;
&gt;Brigestone: Potenza RE900     205/70 TR 14     $59
&gt;            Potenza RE92      205/70 HR 14     $59
&gt;            Turnanza QL20     
&gt;                     T rated  205/70 TR 14     call
&gt;            'Orig Eq' S402    205/70  R 14     $47
&gt;
&gt;Dunlop:     Sp40 A/S         P205/70 SR 14     $50  *****
&gt;
&gt;Pirelli:    P400 Touring      205/70 TR 14     $59
&gt;            P4000 Super Tour  205/70 HR 14     call
&gt;            P700Z             205/70 TR 14     call
&gt;
&gt;Yokohama:   A378              205/70 HR 14     $48
&gt;            'Orig Eq&quot; tires:
&gt;                A321          205/70 VR 14     $85
&gt;                Y372          205/70 SR 14     $48
&gt;                Y382         P205/70  R 14     $57  *****
&gt;
&gt;***** Actual 'match' to the VW specs. Only 2 matches.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;There were NO Sport/light truck tires listed at this size. There appeared to
&gt;be only:
&gt;
&gt;     205/75 SR 14 and
&gt;     215/70 HR 14
&gt;
&gt;tires listed in this catagory.
&gt;
&gt;Another question - I know that 'SR' means 'sport radial' and that 'R' simply
&gt;means 'radial'. I also believe that the 'P' before the id means 'passenger'
&gt;I do not know the meanings of 'VR', 'HR', and 'TR'. I'd rather not guess.
&gt;
&gt;None of the tires state that they are reinforced. And, are the 'Orig Eq' tires
&gt;actually tires that meet specs for being shipped on vehicles from manufacturers
&gt;My local tire man has told me that &quot;original factory tires ALWAYS wear better
&gt;and longer than ANY replacement tires.&quot; Is he correct? If so, shouldn't I
&gt;go for that choice?
&gt;
&gt;Any correlation between survey data and the tires listed above would be 
&gt;helpful! Any input on what any of YOU would choose for quality and longevity
&gt;would be helpful.
&gt;
&gt;NOTE: The prices are only included for comparison purposes. These were the 
&gt;prices listed as of yesterday - and I am in no way trying to promote the
&gt;TireRack. I will probably buy locally for the associated service (mounting,
&gt;balancing and rotation every 10k miles) but I do use Tire Rack as a point of
&gt;reference so that I can ask for what I want with some knowledge.
&gt;
&gt;Thankx-
