They're called that in Europe, and in Canada if you get the cargo van 
version, or the single &amp; double cab pickups (yes they are around up 
here).
 
&gt; &gt; A while back I wrote to VW asking them about the possibility of
&gt; &gt; re-introducing Westfalia vans in the US market. Here is the response that I
&gt; &gt; just received. They apparently think that there is no demands for these
&gt; &gt; vans here. I wonder if there is a way to convince VW that there still is a
&gt; &gt; decent demnad for Westfalias in US.
&gt; response
&gt; &gt; &gt;equipment in the US-market. However, the firm Winnebago offers a
&gt; &gt; &gt;conversion for the Volkswagen Transporter in the United States. The
&gt; &gt; &gt;equipment they offer is orientated towards customers=B4 wishes in your
&gt; &gt; &gt;country.
