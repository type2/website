 I poked around last night for a few minutes surveying what I will have to do
 to remove the engine from my '74 Westy. Can anyone tell me whether it is 
 easier to remove the engine and transmission together, as a unit - which would
 go more or less straight down -  or to take the engine out by itself - back 
 and down - . There doesn't appear to be much room behind the engine to pull
 it clear of the transmission input shaft. Has anyone tried it both ways?

 Thanks in advance,

 Dave
