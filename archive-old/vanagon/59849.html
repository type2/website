Ron,
As a matter of fact I did get an answer, (adjust/tighten/move the plastic
cover) but been there, did that, and didn't help. I've been turning the
jams up here lately (picked up some new music) so I guess I had a brain
lapse and forgot to re-ask. But it would be nice to get this fixed. Anyone
out there have any ideas? Mine is kind of a &quot;plastic&quot; scrape sound, not
really like metal on metal, what about yours Ron? While I'm at it I was
also wondering if anyone else out there has a problem when trying to shut
the wing flaps, the rubber seal seems to get caught on the latch and in
order to shut it I have to put the window all the way down and reach from
the outside, pull the seal out of the way and close it with the other hand.
(sorry for the run-on) Needless to say this is all but impossible to do
while moving 65mph ;) (we all only go 65, right??) down the highway. I
really can't think of an easy/quick/inexpensive way to fix this, anyone
have any ideas? I just have been not using them, but I like the way that
the flaps pull the air out in the summer and you can't get the same effect
from opening the window. Just out of curiosity, do you (all you wonderful
listmembers out there) ever get together around Indianapolis ??? I am
always looking for other Bus/Vanagon people out there, not too many around
here though, (I spend a LOT of my average work week driving either to work,
or for work, or weekends up North to visit the family) and I probably see
about one or two a month. Where are all you listmembers at ? I would really
like to meet some other people who I don't have to explain why I would
rather push my VW Vana??? ( oops,... almost forgot about the subliminal
message ;)) then drive anything else (new or old) I mention Indy because I
work down here, we have the race this month, and Dear Creek has LOTS of
good concerts all summer long, hope to see all of ya out there and on the
road soon,...
