I thought this was a joke but I guess it's not.

This is known as blatant fraud.  I can't believe anyone is gullible to even
entertain this idea.

I refuse to dignify this thread with any more comment other than to say
that PT Barnum was right on.  (actually it was someone else, but ol' PT got
the credit)
