Rain-X. My Subaru has maybe the world's worst wiper (okay, except maybe for
the '71 Westy I used to drive). It wears out in a couple of months, no
matter how much it gets used, and the only place to get new ones is at the
dealer. So I got fed up, decided to try Rain-X and see if it would help. It
did--immensely. Now I hardly ever have to use the wiper, and when I do, it
works ever so much better than it did before--actually removes water from
the windshield.

And no, I don't work there, hold stock, anything like that.
