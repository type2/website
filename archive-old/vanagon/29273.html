Subject:       FS: 21-Window in Utah $1400

Got a buddy that is selling a guys '67 21-Window bus.

Must sell in the next few days, apparently the ex-girlfriend has him 
nailed by the law for child support!  (He was asking $2500)  Moral of 
the story:  Obvious.

White over Sea-Foam Green.

Exterior:

Standard Rocker-panel rustout
Minor dent at bottom of nose
Canvas top in good shape
Missing rear bumper
Bondo patches here and there.  Nothing unusual.
Nose painted w/ white house paint!  (YES, you are correct sir!)

Interior:

Pretty hashed.  No rear seats.
the divider behind the passanger seat has been half-way cut out, and 
a log used as support from floor to roof.  (You tell me?!?)
Dash is good.
Homedone paneling job.

Mech:

1600dp, fairly recent rebuild.
New front end work.
Car is currently registered, FWIW.
14&quot; Standard wheels, w/ FUNKY Low profile race-aqua tires on front 
(supposedly over $150 ea).  Normal 14's on back.

$2500 is pretty fair (considering good engine) IMHO.

$1400 is a steal.

I would have bought it on Saturday, but I would rather put $1k into 
the Poineer.

Respond Privately if you are interested.

As usual, all disclaimers; just passing the info along.  If anyone 
is serious (about driving out to Utah and all) I'll get ya the 
details.
