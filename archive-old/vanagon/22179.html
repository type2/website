Howdy,

	An addition to the Thread That Won't Die (tm)

	In &quot;The Net&quot; the everysofoxy S Bullock drives a cabriolet,
and parks it next to a 6X deluxe bus with surfing stickers all over it
at the airport.

	That was the high point of the movie for me.  The rest of it
kinda sucked, bad.  Pulled 13&quot; hg IMHO :)

	I took my bus to the drive-ins last night, and it got a few comments.
The only problem was I didn't have and FM radio in it, so I had to rent
one for $10!

Thom
