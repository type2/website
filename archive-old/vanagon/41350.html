&gt;Following Ajax' hints from a few weeks ago, I ordered a Crutchfield catalog
&gt;as basic reference material. After drooling for a while, I called the 800
&gt;number to find 
&gt;out what size reciever would fit in the Syncro Westie. The sales rep said I
&gt;could 
&gt;not exceed 6 1/4 inches in depth. That pretty much excluded 95% of the head
&gt;units
&gt;they had listed, including ALL the dash mounted CD players.
&gt;
&gt;Who has been down this road before?  Is the 6 1/4&quot; restriction for real?
&gt;
&gt;

Measure for youself.  You can get under the dash by removing the ash tray.
 There is a metal bracket that can be reomved for more space.  The heater
housing will support the rear of the radio with a little rubber shim added.
