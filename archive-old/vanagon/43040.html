TF&gt;It makes me wonder, what is the longest life listmembers can report
TF&gt;for a wasserboxer? What is typical?

TF&gt;Tom F.

Talked to a guy once I stopped in a parking lot, 228k on a '87 syncro
never had a problem, never changed the coolant or the tranny oil, only
thing he had ever done was change the engine oil.  He lived out some
back mountain WV roads and beat the thing pretty heavily.  He did
replace the power steering rack at 150k though.

I've got 157k on my 87 syncro without any sign of problems.  Second owner however, so who knows what was done before me!
