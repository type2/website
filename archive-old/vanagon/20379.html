I have a new GEX in my '76 (2L FI).  Here's what I've done:
oil = Valvoline 20W50
checked valves at 500 miles - they had tightened up - readjusted
at 1000 miles I adjusted valves again (they had tightend again), changed 
oil, and re-torqued heads.  The inside head bolts on both sides were fine,
the outside ones on both sides needed to be tightened some.  I used a 
torque wrench and went to 350#.  For the first 1000 miles I did not 
over-rev or wind out the engine.  I kept speeds under 60mph.  Since then 
I've been up to 65-70mph and it feels good and tight - I even had accel. 
left but did not push it.
Also, I can tell my rings are sealing - both times when I adjusted 
valves, the flywheel was harder to turn, showing I've got good compression.
Good Luck!
