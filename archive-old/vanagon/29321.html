Subject: Rear brakes squeak

Just replaced the rear brakes on the 86 Syncro. The brakes work fine 
but they now have a loud squeak.

I know there is some sort of compound that can be placed on the inside 
of disk pads to prevent squeaking but what can I do about the rear drum
brakes? The squeak is really annoying.

I used &quot;bonded&quot; shoes from Lucas instead of rivetted VW shoes. Could
this be the cause of the problem? (Lucas was less than half the cost
of the VW shoes.)

Any help and/or insights greatly appreciated.
