Well this is what I get for reading those little blips Joel keeps passing on.
I went ahead and bit on one. I am now the owner of an &quot;extremely rare&quot; AC
blower designed for westies from 68-78. Unlike the others designed to attach
to the roof this sucker fits under the dash--and it really does. The only VW
approved model built by dpa mfg. co., part # zvw 805 5019 now sits on my
dinner table. Yea, I know what some say, anyone who has to have AC shouldn't
own a VW bus--but, sure is cool (sorry for the coloquial) and I canon't really
say I got it for the AC as much as the novelty. It will be at least 2 yrs
before I could possible get around to getting a new engine and have the thing
installed. No copressor, hoses, or condenser coil. It does have the evaporator
coil with it. But I figure this means I can probably use the new type of AC
equipment. Thing is though, no doubt it was intended more for the type IV. I
figure worse comes to worse I can always sell it--but for now I can think
about what type of engine could best cope with this. It wouldn't be for
touring, mainly for when my wife heads to work in a suit kind of thing. Oh
well, it is an excellent adventure friends.Besides, $85 wouldn't have bought
 those Kaldorons anyway.
