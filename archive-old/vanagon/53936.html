The distilled water helps in some areas because the local water supply
is either too hard or too soft (it's in the archives, I think it said
too hard).  Anyway, if it was too hard, those extra minerals in the
water help speed up the corrosion.  Thus, using distilled water can
help.  However, if you've got a decent water supply, it's not necessary.
