Subject:      Eurovan Tires

May we have the size, etc. of those Michelin tires again, please.

I am very happy to hear about these tires for the EV, because the first
time I rotated the Goodyears on my 1997 EV was at 7,500 miles, and my tire
man said that I would be lucky if I get 15,000 miles out of them at their
current rate of wear.

And what is the price of the new Michelins?
