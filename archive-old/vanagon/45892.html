                   The KC Run, Getting There


Day Two saw me heading out of Needles just before dawn after a
sketchy five hour nap.  I had about fifteen gallons of fuel and
wanted to get into the rimrock country before the heat of the
day.  About noon I stopped for fuel.  That morning the engine oil
had been down a pint and there was some indications of a leak
from the tranny.  The oil was okay at noon but the tranny left
three fat drops of oil during the time it took to refuel.

Refueling meant more coffee.  I still had a couple of bagles and
lots of dried fruit.  I munched and sipped my way across Arizona
and most of New Mexico before calling it a night, pulling into a
motel in Moriarity about twelve hours and six hundred miles after
leaving Needles.

On the third day I came down from the mountains into the hill
country of west Texas, the start of the American steppes.  I'd
only gotten about four hours sleep when I was awakened by a
disturbance in the room next to mine.  I packed up and hit the
road.  It was about 4:00 A.M.  

I had a nice tail wind and the road conditions were good, giving
me reason to hope I would end the day in Kansas City, about nine
hundred miles away.  I got coffee in Santa Rosa, waiting for it
to perk, the restaurant having just opened.  Back on the highway
I broke my fast with a bagle, coffee, my last banana and a
handful of dried apricots.

Oklahoma was delightfully green and I was making good time.  But
fate in the form of friendly advice from the truckers took a
hand.  To avoid Oklahoma City I was advised to take Highway 82
north to Enid and cut over to the interstate from there. 
Unfortunately, access to highway 82 thru El Reno was under
construction and I spent a couple of hours creeping through one
small town after another.

Back on the interstate and approaching the Kansas line I learned
the Kansas Turnpike is a toll road.  Again, truckers offered a
variety of comments including a guided tour around the toll road
that would get me to Kansas City just as quickly.  But no one
mentioned the tornados.  Or the thunderstorms.  

Deep in the hinterlands of Kansas, somewhere south and west of
Wichita, we ran into a furious thunderstorm.  It was just past
sundown and suddenly the trucks I'd been following were pulling
off the road.  A tornado warning had been issued and their
insurance would not cover any damage if a tornado caught them
rolling after a warning had been issued.  I sopped my windscreen
with Rain-X, installed my lone wiper blade and pushed on.

There was some flooding due to the rain and I was forced to
backtrack, always working north and east.  I eventually crossed
the line of the toll road and took it, pulling off at the next
town of any size -- Emporia -- and calling it a day, some 810
miles and nearly twenty hours on the road.

I checked in to the first motel I saw only to discover it had
neither hot water, linens nor towels.  It was run by a Hindoo
gentleman who insisted I should be patient, that the water would
get hot in time, that bedding was being found at that very
instant and the towels and wash clothes would be there by the
time the water was hot.  

I did not lose my temper.  Nor did I cock my .45.  But it took
both anger and visible proof of my willingness to commit mayhem
to get my money back.  The next motel down the street had linen,
bedding, towels and even hot water.  

The next morning I ate my last bagle as I cruzed north on I-35. 
It isn't a toll road but then it was only one-lane wide in many
sections, thanks to construction work.  I motored past Kansas
City on I-435, took the Edwardsville off-ramp and was at the
Polys house by noon, where I began the task of unloading a ton of
cargo and a very nice little engine for the Spyder 550 replicar
Bob Polys is building.

The outward-bound part of the KC run covered 1,738 miles, some of
it back-tracking around the storm.  Coming home would be easier.
