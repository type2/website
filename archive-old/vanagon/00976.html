&gt; One thing I wish I could do is send hot air through the fresh air vents 
&gt; to the back.  Is there a simple way to reroute something to get it to do 
&gt; that?

On my '91 its the bottom lever all the way to the left and the 2nd from the
top lever moved toward the left (depending on how much heat you want).
