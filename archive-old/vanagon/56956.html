Subject: Where can I find Vanagon Springs?

Hi Volks,
    I'm courious, does anyone know where to buy new springs for
Vanagons?  I mean besides the dealer.  I haven't really started looking
yet but I thought I would ask here first.  Mine are a bit weak.  The van
looks lower in the front than it should and I've noticed, even with new
tires and shocks, the ride is a bit harsh. Maybe its the time of year.
Here in New England the pot holes get pretty bad. Any leads will be
apreicated, take care.
