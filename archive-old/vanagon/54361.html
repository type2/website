Would someone mind e-mailing me with the instructions on re-subscribing
again.  I'm sorry to post this here : ( but I had my computer in the shop all
week and when I got back on-line - expecting to be inundated with VW mail - I
found NOTHING!  Gee...talk about rejection : ).  It's so quiet here on the
outside - Someone show me the way back in : ).  I know I should have kept the
instructions handy - but organization is one of my least developed skills :
).  Thanks for the help.

Cyndi
