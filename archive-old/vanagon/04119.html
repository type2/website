&gt; &gt; Well, if you want something KOOL, then I would rather put up with a lack
&gt; &gt; of cooling power, than the hassle of lighting the fridge. It just doesn't
&gt; &gt; seem to light until my thumb is good and bloody! EVERY TIME!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyone have any maintenance tips besides vacuming the spider webs?

&gt; I thought my 'falia was the only one that takes two hours and
&gt; 1,672 clicks of the ignitor button to start the fridge on propane!
&gt; Guess not.  The stove burners ignite right away.

Right On! Scott!
Right On! Brian!

(Sorry Derek, I just can't help myself)  ;)


My best fix to date for this is to clean out the spider webs etc. if
you have them and bite-the-bullet and buy the VW cover for the flue
vent.  They are, unfortunately, overpriced as Hell ($18.00) and they
fall apart after about a years use, but they really keep the problem
from reoccuring.  I've tried to find a Tupperware or Rubbermaid 
shallow bowl that would be a good substitute, but I haven't been able
to get a good match.  I think VW researched this one real good so that
there is no bowl in the entire world that has the same dimensions.
And, of course, the material for theirs is designed to self-destruct
every year. :(
