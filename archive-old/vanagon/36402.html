&gt; I think it's safe to say that many of us on this list have been in a similar

&gt; car in the world better, but when it hit the skids, you didn't want to be
&gt; anywhere near one, and I think that's pretty true, which is why we
&gt; still have an all-VW motorpool  (I know... I like playing w/ fire...)
&gt;
&gt; Steve's suggestion of hunting down that electronics demon is a very
&gt; good one and we're all sitting here betting that's at the root of your
&gt; van's troubles, so damn the MGs...ya gotta do what ya gotta do....

More I think on it, more I think that's exactly what's wrong.  Gonna ride
those dudes about it some more today.

&gt; BTW, that narrow angle V6 is a 15 degree V and was designed to
&gt; occupy the same amount of bay space as the I-4's.  While it's a
&gt; wonderful engine, I wouldn't necessarily expect better reliability w/
&gt; neck-snapping speed to come w/ the VR6 Eurovan (if it ever makes
&gt; it to dealers here).  I know, Tim, what you really want is a 6.2 liter
&gt; Cummins diesel shoved into the front of your EV; you got a tough
&gt; truck engine, early warning, good mileage, AND you can haul your
&gt; house around w/ you wherever you go!   ;-)
&gt;
&gt; Hang in there!

Actually, I'm one of those that doesn't have a problem with the 5-banger's
power.  Only time I thought it too weak, I was at about 9K feet in the
Beaver Mountains in Utah, going up a STEEP hill with front and rear AC
running to keep all 7 of us (and our camping and fishing gear) comfortable.
Took a while to get into second gear.  Rest of the time, I can break the
speed limit in just about all highway conditions.  That and 21mpg are about
enough for me.  VR6 would have to do quite a bit better, particularly in
mileage, to be worth taking a chance and going into additional debt on
another vehicle's problems or lack thereof.
