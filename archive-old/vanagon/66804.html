Subject:      Re: sealing  compound, need help

Darrell,

I think Bentley is still the best overall resource for the 2.1 - but there
certainly are a lot of details it doesn't cover. Some are standard practice,
and the others are magic.

The numbers in Bentley for sealants and lubes are VW numbers. If you still
have a VW dealer who hasn't closed down (we've gone through 4 in 10 years) the
parts dept. should be able to get the real stuff.

The case split CAN use the same as for other VW cases. However, since I've
never seen a case leak with the &quot;AMV 188 001 02&quot; anaerobic (green) compound
I'd need a good reason to try anything else.

Curil compounds seem to be common aftermarket sealants for VWs. Notes I've
seen say K2 is especially recommended (by whom?) for case halves, waterboxer
head nuts, etc. Curil T is especially recommended (same who?) for the
waterboxer head gasket to head seal. The &quot;T&quot; is rated for up to 250 deg; K2 to
200. Otherwise they sound similar

So far I've only used the VW &quot;D 000 400&quot; black sealant on the waterjacket
gasket. This seems to hold until the corrosion &amp; gasket crushing cause leaks,
but....

&quot;MOS base 2&quot; sounds like chemical formula abbreviation for Molybdenum
DiSulfide - which is a common dry lubricant added to greases for high-load
lubrication. I used to use &quot;Molycoat paste&quot; from Dow-Corning before my supply
got lost in a move. You might also use a light graphite wheelbearing grease.

I've got a 2.1 in similar spread-apart-state, and also got the K2 in the
gasket kit. Maybe those few tubes of sealant are why the VW set is a few
hundred $ more?

&gt;From:   Vanagon mailing list on behalf of Darrell Boehler
        I am doing a major rebuild on my 2.1 and have sealant questions.
First is there a better book than the Bentley for the 2.1?
&lt;snip&gt;
What type on sealant should be used on the case split? Is the aviation
stuff we use  on 2.0L OK?

My gasket kit contained  some curil k2 Bentley never calls for this stuff
where is it used?

What is used on the rubber head gasket?

The  head nuts?

Are the cylinder o-rings installed dry?
When bentley calls for akd 456 000 01,amv 188 001 02    or   &quot;d3  brownish
color Sealant&quot; and d 000 400  are these VW part numbers?

Also what kind of greese is  &quot;MOS base 2&quot; for the pilot bearing?Will
chevron sri factory lub sub OK?

Thanks much for any help on the above items as I am somewhat confused  .
