Subject: 85 WESTY fs-Phx, AZ

Rusty VanBondo spotted a Westy at the &quot;Ugly Duckling CarSales&quot; in Chandler, AZ.
Wolfburg Edition,  new looking 185R14 XZX's extra jump seat in the rear, 
Bronze-ish Brown and white poptop.  Chuckled when I saw it listed as a
&quot;Vanwagen&quot; on the sales info sheet.  Stock # 8 75817.  1489A-99.  Sales guy
said it was &quot;on sale&quot; for $6500 obo looks real nice with no dents, rust or
apparent leaks. Approx 90K miles. I didn't have time to get more details as
to tranny type, a/c or no a/c etc. I have no connection to these folks etc.
