&gt;Hey Rich,  I'd definately sport the stickers on all of my vehicles, shoot I
&gt;might even put one on my dogs rear window (just kidding), really--I think
&gt;its a great idea. I was a little late on the netvergnugen t-shirts a few
&gt;months ago.

&gt;&gt;Howdy all,
&gt;&gt;Hope everyone had a pleasant Holiday vacation. Over mine, I did some
&gt;&gt;checking up on making up list stickers. My main concern is that I would
&gt;&gt;have to order 500 (yes, five hundred) stickers as a minimum, to get the
&gt;&gt;best price possible. So, basically, I just want to make sure I can sell
&gt;&gt;enough to cover myself. Though I won't describe the design (just a tad
&gt;&gt;paranoid), I do believe they will be pretty nifty. One of the big points
&gt;&gt;of these stickers, I think, is to place them in a standard spot, on the
&gt;&gt;rear left corner/window, to be able to instantly identify fellow
&gt;&gt;members. So, they will stand out, but NOT in a tacky fashion. They are
&gt;&gt;very tasteful, and simple, yet elegant, and with lotsa symbolism present
&gt;&gt;in the design. :)
&gt;&gt;  Bottom lines are these-
&gt;&gt; Cost would be $5.00 for 3, $10.00 for 7, and generally $2.00 each. BUT,
&gt;&gt;I don't really want to sell singles, as $2.00 checks are kinda silly.
&gt;&gt;Sending cash would probably be most convenient, but there can be many
&gt;&gt;problems with that, so that's kind of risky.
&gt;&gt;  Shipping would be easy, however, as I would probably ask everyone for
&gt;&gt;a self-addressed, STAMPED envelope. one stamp should be good for up to
&gt;&gt;10 stickers, and 2 stamps certainly for 10 more.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;So, then, should I take the plunge? If everyone out there got some, then
&gt;&gt;there would definately be plenty of demand. Please let me know, since if
&gt;&gt;I can do it without going to the poorhouse, I'd really like to.
&gt;&gt;
