&gt;dip their high beams, align their lights, move into the right lane, signal
&gt;before turning (not just during the turn) etc.?

what i have determined is that the great majority of people have become so
accustomed to automobiles that they forget it is a heavy, dangerous machine
that needs to be controlled. it is like the difference between a flyer and
a pilot: a flyer just steers the airplane around in the air. a pilot worries
about other airplanes, fuel load, passengers, temperatures, emergency landing
areas, etc. most folks on the roads are reminded of the machinery-aspect of
their vehicle only when it breaks down. otherwise, it's just an appliance.
like a toaster or refrigerator.

and, i suppose, this is just stupidity ... but people do it every day with
all sorts of dangerous tools: chain saws, electric knives, drills, etc. we
all lapse into this sense of relaxation ... and we get bit every now and then.
most of the time, we don't get hurt badly. but it can kill, if we are not
lucky.

but mostly, i just consider that the other drivers are not paying attention
to anything outside their car. as far as they are concerned, they are just
in another room of their house.  i've often thought that part of the driving
school just be an entire weekend at the emergency room of a hospital, and a
tour of the junkyards. but i've seen the films, and i still act stupid in a
car ... so none of us is immune from stupidity. ;)

me personally, i'd rather drive late at night, on the interstate, with nothing
but 18-wheelers on the road with me. cause those drivers have been through
some really good training ... well, at least, much more than the average Joe
behind the wheel of his Taurus ... i can count on one hand the number of times
i've been menaced by a big truck, in 36 years of driving. the 4-wheeler count
is just too high to even keep track of. every day, it's at least two or three.
which is why i stay the hell off the highway on holidays like these ... yeah,
i know: i'm an old fart. :)

but, to paraphrase an old aviation saying:
There are Old Drivers, and there are Bold Drivers.
There are NO Old Bold Drivers.

remember, folks: be careful out there. ;)
