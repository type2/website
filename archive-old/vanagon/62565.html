Subject: purchasing advice

Vanophiles-

Looking to purchase a Syncro in the near future.  Looking to all for
advice on what to look(out) for!

I also wanna get info on h.p./torque, option packages, etc. or a place
where I can get this info.

Last, once I get (if I get!) a decent example, are there CARB legal h.p.
upgrades, suspension, brake upgrades etc.?  I have a feeling I'm SOL in
terms of upgrades?  Please, no Chevy 454 conversions thank you.

THANKS IN ADVANCE!
