Subject:      Grease seal on '84

Does anyone have a good technique for removing a grease seal on the front
inner wheel bearing on a 1984 Westy.  Is there a way to do it without
ruining it?  I recently replaced my front rotors and bearings and I would
like to use my old bearings and seals as emergency spares if I can salvage
them.  Or am I just being cheap....

Scott
