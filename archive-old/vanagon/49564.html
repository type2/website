Subject: Thursday caravan camping o'nite location


To recap, some of us from the bay area will be caravaning up to the
mountains Thursday evening.  We're departing from my house in Moraga
at 6 p.m., then meeting up with others to depart from the rest area
of the Altamont pass in Livermore at 7 p.m.  Beg/borrow/steal/buy a
CB and get on channel 2, good buddies.  

Plan is to head on up to Yosemite and camp in the free camping spot
there Kathy Myers told us about.  Vague instructions on how to
get to Yosemite, and where this camping spot is will follow.  If
you can't join the caravan, but want to meet up with us at the
free camp space, please feel free to do so.

Take the most direct way from your place to Manteca. Then to Highway
120. Follow 120 to Yosemite.

FABULOUS - FREE -
&gt;Forest Service campground on the west side, on the way into Yosemite on
&gt;Highway 120. It is called &quot;Carlon&quot; and it is about 1/4 mile off 120 on
&gt;Evergreen Road - the road into Hetch Hetchy. Just thinking that you could
&gt;meet Steve and spend Thursday night there. It does not have safe running
&gt;water so you'll need to schlepp it that far, at least. From there, your
&gt;drive to Mammoth would only be about 2 1/2 hours - give or take.
