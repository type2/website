i pulled the engine from a 72' without too much difficulty. make sure you
have the vehicle jacked up high enuf so that when you drop the engine you
can clear the carbies, either that or remove them beforehand. don't have
much (make that ANY) experieence removing the engine and tranny together.

&gt; I poked around last night for a few minutes surveying what I will have to do
&gt; to remove the engine from my '74 Westy. Can anyone tell me whether it is
&gt; easier to remove the engine and transmission together, as a unit - which would
&gt; go more or less straight down -  or to take the engine out by itself - back
&gt; and down - . There doesn't appear to be much room behind the engine to pull
&gt; it clear of the transmission input shaft. Has anyone tried it both ways?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt;
&gt; Dave
