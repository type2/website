&gt;I own what I _think_ is a '67 Kombi.  Everything I've seen (which is 
&gt;probably not much) has led me to believe this.  My bus has 11 windows (2 
&gt;front windshields, one per door, 1 rear, and three tilt-outs on each 
&gt;side).  It came with a 'camper style' interior with a fold out bed, two 
&gt;'closets' on top of the engine hump, and a variety of fold out tables, 
&gt;storage spaces, and other such things.  It is a walk thru, and has a 
&gt;solid roof (no pop top, no sun roof).  It still has the tent/awning rail.

Did it come from the factory with a headliner?  You'll be able to tell 
there will be a row of metal clips all along the edge on the side, just 
above door height.  That would be a standard.  Else == kombi
