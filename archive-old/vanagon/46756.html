Thanks for the report Kerry. I ordered a pair of shocks from Bus Boys this 
morning and will probably install them this weekend. By the way, Bus Boys 
has these shocks for $45 each versus $275 each at dealers, including 
Camelback (formerly Paul Wasser). This is the biggest VW dealer scam I've 
heard of!
