Subject: POR15 in VW Trends (source addr)

Jack Reed (type2 list) was wishing that I fwd the info rePOR15 to the list(s).

VW Trends September, 1996, pg 11.
A very neutral &quot;sales&quot; type review in the &quot;Whats New&quot; column.

They say:
Write for free catalog on this and other products from
Restomotive Laboratories, Inc.
PO Box 1235, Dept. VWT,
Morristown, NJ 07962-1235

(800) 457-6715

BTW: The magazine lists tons of &quot;our&quot; web pages in an article on pg.72.
