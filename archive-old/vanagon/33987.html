FWIW

I was in the local Frey's this weekend ( a combination convenience store and
{computer, software,audio/video, electronic supply, telephone, camera,
modem,fax, and God knows what all else San Francisco Bay area and Los Angeles
emporium).  One of the things hanging on a rack in the check out line was an
alarm that you could stick anywhere.  It was advertised to generate a 109 dB
wail when triggered, had a self contained battery, and was supposed to trip on
any sound or shock of breaking and or entry.  Cost was modest $10-15???
Thant's about all I know of it - what I had time to read on the card as I went
by it.
