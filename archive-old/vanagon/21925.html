Subject: RE: Oil Splatters in Engine Compartment

me too! same (1600 DP) engine.

It's really confounding.  Sometimes I think it's the oil bath air cleaner (the 
source I mean)...as in maybe it's overfull, but it's not.  However, it's 
almost always oily when I take the elbow off the top of the carb., and into 
the carb throat there's a film of oil.

Of course, the oil in this area is probably coming from the other direction 
(the engine), right?  Which indicates a blowby/breathing problem, I'd think.  
I don't think I am suffering from blowby.  Which leaves me with crankcase 
ventilation as a possible culprit.

Does anyone on the list have experience with crankcase breathing problems?  Is 
there anything which can go wrong ala a PCV valve on water-cooled engines?  
I've seen that Gene Berg and others sell a &quot;breather box&quot; whi
