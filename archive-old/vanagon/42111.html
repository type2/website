&gt;Does anyone know what the differences are between the various colours of
&gt;torsion bars as regards the different models of bay window VWs?

I don't know the differences, sorry.
The Sydney price sounds pretty good, provided that the exchange-rate is
something under 2US:1AU.
Another source to consider would be any of the dealers in Mexico, Brazil,
South Africa, where that body style (or something very similar) is still in
production.
