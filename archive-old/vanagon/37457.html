&gt; This is for all you split window folks--I'm looking at an old 
&gt; splittie, and I'd kind of like to know what year it is before I go 
&gt; back to the owner with a serious offer.  It has bullet turn signals 
&gt; in the front, and red glass circles in the rear,  but it's not a 
&gt; barndoor.  The front seat is a bench, and th rear is a camper 
(snip)&gt; 
&gt; Any guesses as to the age or comments on the find???
&gt; (It's too far away to just zip out and look for the numbers)
&gt; 
I would guess a 58-61.  It maybe a 55-57 depending on the type of round 
taillights and the type of bumpers, engine etc.  The date code on the 
back of the speedo is a good clue if you can get to it.  8-)  Other date 
codes help too if it hasn't been messed with much--wheels are an easy one 
(they're enclosed in a little circle by the lug nuts).
