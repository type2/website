&gt;&gt;pics...he wins...though I am still convinced that Ras Split is between
&gt;&gt;25 and 30% body-fill].  This is the second trip I haven't been ready
&gt;
&gt;I dunno, I think my '54 is a very strong contender in the &quot;Resto From Hell&quot;
&gt;contest.  Especially since I found out my front beam is welded on.  Been
&gt;stewing on that one all week...
&gt;
&gt;Yours may bee 25-30% filler, but mine is 50-70% RUST!

Your &quot;before&quot; pictures sure are scary. We don't think of yours as a resto,
really--we think of it as a fabrication.

  First I had a barndoor.
  Then I had a barndoor and a sandblaster.
  Now I have a sandblaster and a...nub!

I have a question. The more prosaic barndoors have louvers up top as well
as below. But yours (and pickups, I guess) have no upper louvers, in your
case because you have windows there. So what do the upper louvers do in the
barndoors that have them? Are they snorkeled to the engine compartment like
bays? Are they for interior venting?
