Revolutionary Stove Uses Hard Fuel

millions of Americans cook outdoors year around.  More than sixty
million people go cmaping annually.  A major hassle for years has
been the drudgery of providing wholesome, good tasting meals while
cooking out of doors.  Paul Hait, a life long outdoors man,
developed a revolutionary outdoor cooking system unlike anything elseHis patented, versatile, high quality Pyromid is so efficient that
it cooks dinner for 6 on only 9 briquettes.  It is so light weight
(6.5 lbs.) and portable you can easily take it anywhere.  Made of
stainless steel, the space age designed Pyromid uses 75% less fuel
than traditional, bulky outdoor cookers.  The pyromid is a grill,
a stove, an oven, a roaster, and a smoker all in one easty to set up and
clean up unit.

The Pyromid looks like something out of Star Trek.  However, it was created 
using one of history's oldest structures, the pyramid.  Unlike kettle
grills, gas stoves and hibachis, the Pyromid is a total cooking system
which comes in a carrying case.

It sets up in less than a minute without the use of any tools.  It's inverted
pyramid design makes it an immediate conversation piece and the center of
attnetion at a tailgate party, camp out of backyard cookout.

What separates this total cooking system from others is the extraordinary
taste of food cooked on it.  Pyromid uses safe and dependable
charcoal briquettes, wood chips or Sterno.  Starter fluid is not
necessary to start Pyromid cooking instead, solid easy to start
fuel sticks which do not affect the flavor of the food are used.  Thanks to the
uniquesly high grilling temperatures provided by a patented technology, 
food flavors are sealed in at the outset of cooking.  Pyromid makes it possible to bring gourmet taste to outdoor cooking.  No other outdoor
natural fuel burning systems can be regulated like a Pyromid.

The use of the principle of &quot;thermal feedback&quot; is what makes it
work.  In practical terms, using this concept, Pyromid uses less fuel 
and equipment, and provides many, many more choices for your menu.  Coals are
ready for cooking in less than 8 minutes.  Pyromid's patented heat
grates enable you to vary the temperature between 350 and
1100 degrees.  The reflective interior means you use fewer charcoal
briquettes, thereby saving money.  

The pyromid cooking system is safer by far than any portable
outdoor cooking device.  The small fire in the Pyromid is 
enclosed and sheltered from wind.  A reflective foil liner keeps
the Pyromid stove base cool to the touch therefore the unit 
may be used on boats, picnic tables or on the tailgate of your vehicle.  
Unlike hibachis, open camp fires, or kettle grills which
take a half an hour or more to cool down, Pyromid cools down in
minutes and can be quickly and safely stowed away.

Pyromid has been used and survived in the most difficult 
conditions from Desert Storm to the recent earthquake in Soutern 
California, making it the ideal, safe and secure, back up
system in the even of an emergency.
