Subject: Pop top bolts

The dozen or so bolt heads on the 81's pop top have rusted and stained the
pop top. I pulled one off and spent the evening at Home Depot where I found
nothing comparable to be used as a replacement. I could sand and repaint the
existing ones, but I'm hoping that someone knows where I can find
replacements instead

Thanks,

Weston
