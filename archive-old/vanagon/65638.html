It's on its way to us right now!!

We just bought a 90 Westy from a guy in Houston, TX.  Near mint condition,
everything works, white, power everything, alloy rims, bra, AC, blah, blah,
blah.  Throw my phone and 10 CD changer in and we're ready to go.  All we
need now is a tent and a lot of time and money to travel.

My 87 died on us in ME this past july and we're psyched to say we have found
a new one!!!!
