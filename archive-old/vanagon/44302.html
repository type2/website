Subject: clutch bleeding help

Hello,

Thanks to everyone who answered my plea for help with the leaking clutch
master cylinder. I called a FLAPS and got both the master and slave
cylinders for $130.00. With them in my hands now I have one other question.
That is, what now? I don't have the cash to get a bentley and I can't go
without my van until I do. Would someone please give me a quick overview of
what to do. What special tools will I need if any? I would like to get this
fixed tomorrow afternoon. I checked the archives but couldn't find anything
about bleeding the clutch. Any info would be greatly appreciated.

dave
