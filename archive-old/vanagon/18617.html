Vanagon Seat Covers

LiMBO has made arrangements with aftermarket seat, carpet and headliner
supplier, SEWFINE, for a 10% discount for LiMBO members. They have just
added Vanagon replacemtent front seat covers to their extensive line of
products. The best part is that they are available in a wide range of colors
in vinyl, velour, or tweed. The standard insert style starts at $129.95/PAIR!
Mid '80's style small armrests are also currently available at $19.95/pair.
Yardage lengths are available for rear seats.

&lt;Ed. note:  I recently installed a pair of these seat covers in my Vanagon
which has '85 seats with small armrests. The fit and finish are excellent and
the choice of colors allowed me to update a fairly worn out interior.
A pattern has also been provided for the non-armrest '80-'84 seats that have
a shorter seatbase. The later adjustable armrest has not been patterned as
of yet. These particular armrests are known to be difficult to remove/install.
If you have any questions, contact me in the evenings at (508) 651-3502.
