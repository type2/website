&gt; 
&gt; does anybody know if there are wire brushes (the type that fit in your
&gt; ordinary drill) that would fit in a 5&quot; Disc Grinder. Right now i have a
&gt; cutting disk on it and would like to outfit it with a bit less abrasive
&gt; disk (i.e. the wire brush idea) and strip some surface rust off the bottom
&gt; (i.e. undercarrige) of the bus.

If the grinder uses a standard 5/8-11 (I think) thread brushes
should be available most anyhere, they will be about $10 each at
normal chain hardware stores but higher quality ones might be cheaper
at welding/tool type shops, shop around, these things are great for
stripping anything but can really heat the metal up so watch out
for deforming the body.
