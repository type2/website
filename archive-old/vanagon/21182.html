&gt;&gt;Also, what causes the trans to jump out of fourth gear when it gets worn.
&gt;&gt;What parts need to be replaced to fix this.  It would be nice to have it
&gt;&gt;right instead of using the bungee method, although the bungee method is
&gt;&gt;probably much cheaper.

The operating sleeves usually get worn. They will need to be replaced, and
you probably want to put in new synchros, seals and maybe some bearings at
the same time. There is a company that advertises in Hot VW's that sells
re-machined operating sleeves, but I never tried using one. I would
recommend against doing the home-base rebuild job. Not that it is too
complex, but you will need some tools: Shimming fixtures ($250-300), dial
indicator &amp; base ($50 for Taiwan, over $100 for name brand) big'ol pinion
nut remover ($40 -later models only) and other assorted tools.

For the one-time job, buy a rebuilt unit with a warranty. If you plan on
doing some more in the future, buy the tools and have some fun. The
cutaway-views make it look more complex than it really is.
