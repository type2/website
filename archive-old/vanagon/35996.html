Subject: FS 69 Westy, any Wannabussers in South


Tomorrow morning I am going to pick up a 69 Westfalia I bought 
last Sunday.  Currently has blown motor which I will replace 
tomorrow night or Sunday.  Has a few dents and dings, only 
significant rust is under the windshield which I will repair 
and replace with new windshield seal.  Also needs ignition 
switch replaced (man, I hate replacing the 1968-73 ignition 
switches... major pain in the a**).

Bought it with only a flashlight inspection, so I don't know 
what it will go for until I get it home, take a good look at 
it, swap engines, test drive it, etc.  Will probably be ready 
to go in 2 weeks.

But if anyone is interested the bus is in the Atlanta area,
delivery may be available, but weekend travel is somewhat 
tight at this point (I still have to deliver the 68 Westy
I sold to Ken in Memphis next weekend!).

Drop me a line &amp; I will let you know more details later.

Dave
