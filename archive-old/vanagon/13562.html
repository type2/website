There have been lengthy FAQs on this all of  which can be located on the
gopher. Some ideas that seem to work:

Placement of curtain between front cab and passenger area;
In-line fan between front vents and heat exchangers;
extensive insulation throughout;
Water-filled heat exchangers;
auxiliary propane/gas/electric heater (the last only while plugged in);
