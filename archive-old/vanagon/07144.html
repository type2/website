&gt; It's also been pretty quiet on #VW,  whassup DavidS... I thought you 
&gt; lived there.   :)

I did!  Uh, I mean, I do!  That is, I did until I went on a work-related
trip followed by the holiday.  I'll be back to hanging out there 12 hours
a day starting tomorrow.  I've met a few list members there already (Gerry,
Martha, and Jack Agnew among others) and hope that more of you will be
stopping by.  If anyone needs information or help on IRC, e-mail me privately,
I'd be happy to help.
