Subject: Re: Let's Keep Joel Busy, Chapter 2

&gt;What about our vehicles pet names? 


Allright, I confess, I've always named my buses 'Blunder', sometimes more 
deservedly than not. It refers to both the condition of the bus, as 
discovered shortly after purchase, &quot;Oh, yeah, I guess the sliding door was a 
little loose in the track but you'll get used to it....&quot; as it tries to 
guillotine my foot while crashing to the ground. Or to the inevitable 
accuracy in steering, ie. Arrrgh matey, prepare to come about.... 
semi-trailer off the port bow!

tim s., owner of Blunder, Son 'o' Blunder, Blunder III, Blunder 9,... more 
to come I'm sure
