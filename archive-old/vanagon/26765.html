Hi all you Vanatics,

I saw the following ads in Southern California: 

1972 VW VAN, Excellent condition, runs great, must see.  $3,250.  (909)
986-0363

1981 VW VANAGON, Stick shift, low mileage, very clean in/out, 8 passenger
seats. $2,400/obo  (909) 353-9771

1986 DODGE Carav*&amp;$#&amp;&amp; oops!

Usual disclaimers apply.  I wonder how many people are getting calls &amp; sales
from people over the net without having any idea how far-reaching their ad
just got by being sent to the list.  Then again I was wondering the other day
about the meaning of life and all ....
