Subject: Marine vs Conventional batteries

West Marine (800/538-0075) has an accurate treatise on batteries that 
should be read by those of us contemplating doing the aux battery 
stuff.  the following info is gleaned from their big catalog.

&quot;Marine battery&quot; is a very generic term that includes a starting 
battery (that would be damaged by repeated deep cycles), deep-cycle 
batteries, and gel batteries.  Essentially, a manufacturer calls 
there battery a 'marine' battery when the various energy measurements for 
cranking, storage, and longevity are measured at 32 F instead of 0 F 
as with conventional battteries.  to quote West Marine, &quot;Battery 
claims are subject to the type of marketing hype that would make the 
proverbial used-car salesman blush.&quot;

While i don't have the time to type in all the info from the catalog, 
they say this about gel batteries.

&quot;Gel batteries have several advantages over flooded batteries:
1.    They are resistant to damage caused by very deep discharges.
2.     They can be chargedmore quickly, and require less charging 
energy to fully recharge.
3.     They maintain a higher voltage as they discharge, so your DC 
appliances work better.
4.     They produce far less hydrogen gas when charging.
5.     They are entirely maintenance free.

The disadvantage is that they cost substantially more than wet 
batteries, and have a life of 400  cycles.  They should not be 
charged at more than 14.1 volts.&quot;
