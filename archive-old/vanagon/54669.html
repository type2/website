Subject: Re: The infamous leaking head gasket


&gt;Parts Place has Cylinder Head gaskets for $29.95 a piece.  Their dealer
&gt;price is claimed to be $62.35.  My mechanic claims he gets a full set, 
&gt;with special sealant &amp; etc. (I don't know what &amp; etc. is) for $400 from a 
&gt;company in New Jersey.
&gt;
&gt;I'll be reading the archives &amp; etc.  It seems this is a meticulous
&gt;procedure especially if heads are pitted.
&gt;
&gt;What's the wisdom on gasket, preparation, and sealant materials?
&gt;

John,

I'm afraid I can't share any wisdom as to the specifics of the job.  I've 
grown pretty used to identifying the symptoms, but as there is a local VW 
garage that will do the job for under $400 plus parts (a great price!), 
I've never been tempted to try it myself.  Of course, the archives are 
fairly extensive regarding this repair.
 
Beware, that Parts Place price is just for the head gasket itself, not the 
full set of gaskets you will need to do the head gasket job.  By the time 
you add the other seals you will need when you remove the heads, you'll end 
up paying much more this way, buying them piecemeal.  Parts Place charges 
$199.00 a pair for the complete Head Gasket kit (the same ones I have for 
$135/pr.).  This is the OEM German kit.  I'm not sure if it comes with the 
special sealant or not (it may??),  but other than that it should be the 
same as the $400 kit your local shop wants to sell you.

Good luck,
Ron
