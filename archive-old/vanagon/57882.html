Subject: Re: clutch cylinder - help

&gt; One thing that bugs me is the &quot;linkage&quot; between the clutch slave cylinder
&gt; and the clutch lever seems to be missing.  It was never complete since I
&gt; have owned the van.  It was kind of home rigged, and I don't know what the
&gt; real setup looks like.  Pictures in the Bentley are pretty vague.  All
&gt; there is now is a steel rod pushing on the ball on the clutch lever.  I

Steel rod should have a socket assembly on its end that pushes on the 
ball on the lever.  Best sign to rebuild, when they leak, 
particularly the slave.  Change the fluid out with your brake fluid 
every 2 years.  And a good hint, work on and remove the slave from 
the engine compartment, MUCH easier, on air cooled you are forced to 
work from below.
