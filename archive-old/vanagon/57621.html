Subject:       87 Non-Start:Digifant Problem?

    BAWANADO an '87 WWW sits listless in the driveway her fuel 
injection system suspect by this fair-weather DIYer. Symptoms
leading to total dismay was a rapid increase in the frequency of 
cutouts at normal highway driving after 30 min to a few hours.  
Installed the VW supplied modification to stabilize the air flow 
sensor signal. A wiring harness w/ add'l capacitor I believe, had 
been previously described in Tech Bulletin. With or without it I now 
have no firing, turns over fine, spark from coil good, rotor rotates. 
I hear fuel pump and smell gas in das motor compartment but not sure 
what to inspect next ? Original owner w/over 155k miles and never 
required a manual for troubleshooting, repair or maintenance. Now I 
wait for my overdue Bentleys w/ diminishing optimism. She's never 
gone back for fixin'(except for CVs and a campaign long ago).
    Any suggestions warmly welcomed - Thanx
