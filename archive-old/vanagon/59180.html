Subject: re problems with new Eurovan (and Rialta)


&gt;With the liftgate (the Winnebago manual's word for what the VW manual refers
&gt;to as the rear lid) open in the rain, water dripped through the vinyl plug
&gt;opening just above the strap and soaked into the lining material.  I
&gt;couldn't tell if the water entered around the embossed VW symbol or from
&gt;around the number plate.  Anyone solved this one?  Does the inside of the
&gt;liftgate be dried out in some way?
&gt;

Never heard of this, but then I don't typically leave the rear hatch
open in the rain for long periods!  I'd have to go out and look at mine,
but I'd check the sealing around the wires to the license plate lights.

&gt;THe channel in which the sliding door runs does not drain.  There is a drain
&gt;hole at the rear end of the channel but not at the front. It seems to me VW
&gt;forgot to drill one little hole.
&gt;

Never had it happen. I don't recall seeing a hole, but I'll check on that
when I go out again.

You must have been in one hell of a rain storm recently - of course that
wouldn't be hard to do around the PNW lately.

&gt;Yes it is under warrenty, but a regular VW dealer is much more convenient to
&gt;get to than the Eurovn dealer and I don't know how familiar they will be
&gt;with the Eurovans.

Well, with a new one you might as well take it down and get your money's
worth on warrany service. Regular VW dealer might be able to help, but only
if its a general mech problem I would think.

And about that Rialta someone mentioned - all I can say is yuk! Those
things are huge road maggots! If you're going to buy an RV you might as
well purchase a domestic one and save some $. The regular EV will fit into
a garage at least!
(Obviously I don't care for the beasts, nothing personal!)
