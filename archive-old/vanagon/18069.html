So John Sharpe says:
&gt; 
&gt; My recently purchased '86 Westy is running well. I love to
&gt; drive it, and I'll never go back to tent camping. But it
&gt; does have one problem, on long gradual up hills the water
&gt; temperature gauge will go way over to the right and the
&gt; red warning light will blink. This has happened twice,
&gt; and both times I slowed from 60~65 to 55~60 and turned
&gt; the heat on. The temperature dropped and the light stopped
&gt; blinking. Also the gauge is normally to the right of the
&gt; red light, about 1/2 way between the light and the max temp
&gt; band. Is that normal?
&gt; 

Along with Drews comments I would grab some Autobahn coolant and
on one of those steep inclines I'd stop and bleed the coolant, 
topping off the overflow tank as I did so.  Be sure that you have
sufficient coolant in the expansion tank as well.  CAUTION: Don't
open the expansion tank with the engine still hot.  You might 
not like the surprise you get!  (Scalding Coolant)  Bleeding 
the system should help with over-heating, but as Drew said, 
check the thermostat and the water pump.  Also check for leaks
starting with the heads and then work your way forward.  If 
you have an aux heater, be sure to check that too.

Hope this helps,

Steven
