Hi all,

My sister-in-law sent me this one.  Might be worth a chuckle.  I added
the part about the VW Bus.  ;-)

Sam has been in the computer business for 25 years and is finally 
     sick of the stress.  He quits his job, packed up his VW Bus and 
     buys 50 acres of land in Vermont as far from humanity as possible.
     
     Sam sees the postman once a week and gets groceries once a month. 
     Other- wise, it's total peace and quiet.  After six months or so of 
     almost total isolation, he's finishing dinner when someone knocks on 
     his door.
     
     He opens it and there is a big, bearded Vermonter standing there.
     
     &quot;Name's Enoch.  Your neighbor from four miles over the ridge. 
     Havin' a party Saturday.  Thought you'd like to come.&quot;
     
     &quot;Great,&quot; says Sam.  &quot;After six months of this I'm ready to meet 
     some local folks.  Thank you.&quot;
     
     As Enoch is leaving he stops, &quot;Gotta warn you, there's gonna be 
     some drinkin'.&quot;
     
     &quot;Not a problem.  After 25 years in the computer business, I can 
     do that with the best of them.&quot;
     
     Again, as he starts to leave Enoch stops.  &quot;More 'n' likely gonna 
     be some fightin', too.&quot;
     
     Damn, Sam thinks... tough crowd.  &quot;Well, I get along with people. 
     I'll be there.  Thanks again.&quot;
     
     Once again Enoch turns from the door.  &quot;I've seen some wild sex at 
     these parties, too.&quot;
     
     &quot;Now that's not a problem,&quot; says Sam. &quot;Remember I've been alone for 
     six months! I'll definitely be there.  By the way, what should I wear 
     to the party? &quot;
     
     Enoch stops in the door again and says, &quot;Whatever you want.  It's just 
     gonna be the two of us.&quot;
