&gt; Hmmm a single  melted piston could be due to a leak in the cylinder head
&gt; brought on by that head running hot (ie this usually happens when the head
&gt; has come loose, the valves are set too tight or the mixture is lean). You
&gt; may want to consider having case savers installed and also checking if
&gt; plug inserts (helicoils) were installed or need to be installed. 

I just wanted to point out that the studs holding the cylinders on in the
type IV motor are much stronger than those in the early type I engine, and
thus the need for case savers has been pretty much eliminated.  I don't even
know if they are available for the type IV.

&gt; 								     The
&gt; question of what to do depends largely on what kind of mileage you expect
&gt; in the long run and the money involved. To replace one piston and its rings
&gt; makes little sense (and may be dangerous); so the right route to go would
&gt; be to consider replacing all four pistons their rings and at least the
&gt; exhaust valves (and possibly the valve guides if they are worn). Others are
&gt; better suited to tell you the prices involved in doing this kind of
&gt; project. The long term perspective is to consider splitting the case and
&gt; having a look at the bearings for wear. This advice is based on the
&gt; assumption that the engine is already out and the additional labour of doing
&gt; this work is not that great if a) you don't need the engine right away and b)
&gt; you do it yourself. 

Good advice.  When (not if) you buy your new pistons and liners, expect to
pay about $250-$300 for the set, and get the 1.8 liter size.  They are a
direct bolt on (well, you might have to have the heads flycut, but since
they will be in the shop anyway...) and don't cost any more than the 1.7
ones.  You get a 100cc increase in displacement for free!  Also, you
will probably pay about $8 each for the exhaust valves, but if you can
afford the sodium-filled variety (at least $25/ea) they run much cooler.
I would expect that a machine shop would charge around $75 to do the
work, perhaps more if you have the guides replaced.

Good luck,
