&gt;Hail fellow Syncronauts - I need advice and moral support!  
&gt;
&gt;On my '89 Syncro (95K miles) the shifting has actually gone beyond the
&gt;suspicious stage - I really should have said &quot;Sh*tty Syncro Shifting
&gt;Symptoms&quot;. Here are the facts of the case:
&gt;
&gt;1) Since I got the van in October, it's sometimes been just a tad
&gt;reluctant to downshift into 2nd or 1st (hard to find the &quot;slot&quot;), but
&gt;I've never any problem upshifting. 
&gt;
&gt;2) A couple of weeks ago (I only drive it a few times a week) it was
&gt;parked, and I started it up and tried to put it in reverse - no go,
&gt;shifter won't &quot;seat&quot;. Hmm. Tried putting it in 1st to rock forward - no
&gt;good either.  If I push the shifter hard enough I begin to hear a very
&gt;slight &quot;whine&quot;. By pushing the car backwards I was able to get it into
&gt;1st and drove home with no further problem.  
&gt;
&gt;3) Since that time have had intermittent problems with it (wouldn't act
&gt;up for my fellow Syncronaut Larry) but it's getting worse.  Also seems
&gt;to go in waves - works great for a several trips, then performs really
&gt;bad for awhile.  Sometimes I can downshift, no problem, sometimes it
&gt;just won't find the slot. ONCE I had trouble downshifting into 3rd.
&gt;Never any problem upshifting. Mostly goes into reverse no problem, but
&gt;sometimes not.  Got it to shift once when it otherwise wouldn't by
&gt;matching the engine speed just right, but haven't been able to duplicate
&gt;that performance.
&gt;
&gt;4) I've discovered that if I absolutely can't get it to downshift into
&gt;1st or 2nd - e.g., at a stoplight - that by turning off the engine I can
&gt;almost always get it in gear and then start the engine with the clutch
&gt;depressed.  A few times the van has actually begun moving slightly as
&gt;the engine starts up, as if the clutch pedal is not really depressed all
&gt;the way...
&gt;
&gt;Did I mention that the PO had a complete tranny/clutch overall at 82K
&gt;miles (18 months ago, out of the 1 year warranty period) to the tune of
&gt;$2700?  That included all new syncros, by the way.  That kind of service
&gt;was what made me think I was making a safe buy, but I'm beginning to
&gt;wonder - has Syncro Madness caught up with me?  (Meanwhile I'm driving
&gt;Old Reliable [ha-ha], Da Rust Bucket.)
&gt;
&gt;So before I throw myself on the mercy of my local Volks Cafe guys
&gt;(inexperienced), the local VW dealer (inexperienced AND a rip-off) or
&gt;the VW dealer who did the original tranny overhaul (experienced,
&gt;perhaps, but 60 miles away) I thought I'd first try checking, draining
&gt;and refilling the transmission fluid.  When I got under there in the
&gt;driveway I noticed a tiny dribble eaking out of the left side of the
&gt;differential at the CV joint, and although I've never seen any on the
&gt;driveway I guess it's possible that the level is low (was supposedly
&gt;checked by Volks guys last fall.) 
&gt;
&gt;As you Syncronauts may know, however, the drain plug is in a heinous
&gt;position only slightly forward of the rear skid plate, whose removal
&gt;seems mandatory in order to drain the fluid (of course, Bentley is mute
&gt;on this subject.) So I guess I'm asking for a few different pieces of
&gt;advice:
&gt;
&gt;A) Correct procedure for draining Syncro tranny?
&gt;B) Correct refill technique? (Pump it somehow?)
&gt;C) Current favorite transmission lubricant?
&gt;D) Any chance my symptoms are really related to lack of lube?
&gt;
&gt;Woe is me - I'd heard enough Syncro horror stories to know what I was
&gt;getting into when I bought this car, but it looks like I may soon have
&gt;one of my own to tell...

&gt;
&gt;

Regarding the above,  It sounds to me that you have a clutch or main shaft
pilot bearing problem.  Get fixed before you do transmission damage.  All
gears including reverse are synchronized.  Clutch not properly disengaing or
pilot bearing dragging will cause all above sysmptons.  While trans it out,
carefully inspect input shaft for wear where it sits in pilot bearing.  This
is a needle bearing in the crankshaft.  Flywhhel also has to be removed to
service it.  The felt washer/seal must be installed to keep clutch disc dust
from destroying this bearing.  Many people do no repace this as it is only
available from the dealer.
Hope this helps,
Dennis.
