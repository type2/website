Subject: Re: Out comes the motor...


&gt; to remove the engine from my '74 Westy. Can anyone tell me whether it is 
&gt; easier to remove the engine and transmission together, as a unit - which would


Drop the motor only or the tranny only, both together make an unwieldy mess. 
There IS room for the engine, take off blower fans, coil, rear tin? and you 
can move it straight back. Don't bend the tranny input shaft! A flat hard 
floor and a trolley jack are heaven for this job, I have used a skateboard, 
wood blocks and a scissor jack however. Putting it back in is harder with 
the Mickey Mouse deal tho'.  tim s.
