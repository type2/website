&gt; Any fellow Canadians tried ordering from JC Whitney? I'd like to get
&gt; some interior lights (fluorescent type, like in earlier Westies) to
&gt; go in mine, and I can't seem to find anyone else who sells them.
&gt; 
&gt; I was thinking of trying JC Whitney, unless someone can suggest
&gt; another source...
&gt; 
&gt; Thx

California Imports says they don't carry anything like that but they suggest 
going to any RV sales/service type of place

Good Luck
