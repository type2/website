&gt;Hmmm. Stock wheels for a US version 91 Westie are the alloy ones. Sounds
&gt;like these are steel. I wonder what other goodies were stripped off so
&gt;they could sell it at such a bargain price!

To which I must add:   NOT
The alloys were standard on the Vanagon GL Camper Syncro, but were optional
on the mere Vanagon GL Camper.  Tom, not all Vanagons are Syncro Westies!  :)
