Headlamp, yes a simple headlamp for my '87 Westy is proving to be a real
problem.  It's the small square one, next to the rectangular large one that
I'm after.  VW dealers here do not supply this part without purchasing the
entire headlamp assembly (both headlamps, all adjusters, and backing
plate) at some god awful price of $500.  I've checked for used and the
places I've found so far will not break up the parts and want $225 for
the assembly.  I did manage to track down a supplier who said he could
order in just the lamp unit for $140, thanks but no thanks.  $140 for a
headlamp shell, I don't think so !  Seems they are made only by Hella and
no jobber parts exist.  Do any of you out there in cyberspace know of a
reasonable solution, used or new ?  I also need the three adjusters for
this light and one, the lower one for the main head lamp unit.  VW wants
$13.00 each for these adjusters. ????  Rip off !  Any and all help would
be appreciated.  The lite and adjusters are for the right hand side,
passenger side.  BTW all this was caused by a large bird trying to attack
my Westy !  

Cheers

Frank
