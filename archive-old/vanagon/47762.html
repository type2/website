&gt;    Simple... SOmeone put DOT 3 brake fluid in your system. Vanagons

&gt;    which is now air in the lines.. = pedel to the floor.

Ludicrous, although I would always use DOT4, old DOT4 (say 1+ years
of hard use) will boil as easily as DOT3.  Frankly the Vanagon brakes
have always been marginal,  I think Martin Sneider (whatever of hi hp
syncro fame) uses crossdrilled rotors etc for increased cooling.  Any
brake system can fade and boil fluid if used hard enough.  The Corrado
with 11&quot; front rotors running ATE Super Blue will still boil the fluid
in short order if pushed hard in an autocross.  Certainly replace all
fluid with a quality DOT4, Castrol GT/LMA a good choice and change it
every 2 years, but check out all of the system very carefully first.
BTW on the origional problem, were the pads near new?  Break in &quot;green
fade&quot; can be similar to heat fade and might explain the &quot;quietness&quot; of
the pads now.
