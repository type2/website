Subject: Re: Cool Vanagon Trucks

Assible to import these things?  Were they sold new in Canada and
&gt;would it be possible to procure them there and bring em in, inquireing
&gt;minds want to know.

Yes they were sold here, I asked a big vanagon dealer in Oshawa, near 
Toronto, the same question a month ago, he could remember selling one or two 
of the double cabs, that's all. He remembers them both being blue. The 
commercial vans, ie panel/single/double cab were only available in medium 
blue, pure white, or medium beige if I remember correctly, no off-white!  
Definately no leather!
