Subject: trans input shaft dia. 85 transporter

Hey everyone.  I hate mondays.

I had a clutch put in my 85 transporter at the dealer (world's WORST VW
dealership (name whithheld)) and I guess they didn't put a new pilot
bearing (supporting the input shaft for the trans.) in when they did so.
Anyway it disintegrated after a while and my shaft got kind of chewn a bit.
Anybody know how much play it can have in the bearing? I doubt any, but
what kind of work (and cost) is it to replace the shaft?

Also, downshifting into 2nd, grinds a bit.  Other gears are fine except on
long trips, ie when everything is hot - things get a bit stiff. Any ideas?

Thanks be to the initiator of the list, amen.
