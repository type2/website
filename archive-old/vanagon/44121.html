Subject: Bentley Delivery

Hey Vanagonauts,  I will be unsubbing on Thursday to go deliver a Bentley
to list member David Yates in Brisbane, Australia!!  We worked it out so he
purchased it and had it shipped to me - and now I get to take it to him!
(Of course I will be doing a few other things while over there!)

BTW, the Corrado powered Syncro Westy in Santa Barbara is now $25,000 obo!
