Hi folx,
	I have in my posession several postcards, each of which is good
for a free one-year subscription to J.C. Whitney (woo hoo!).  If there
are any more people out there that are interested in getting J.C. Whitney
catalogs send me your name, address, and year and model of your VW, and
I will mail in a card for you.  Unless I get 200 requests in which case
I will have to ask for stamps.  :)

-David
