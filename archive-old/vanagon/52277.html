Subject: Distributor Cleaning, Advice needed
Date: 26 Nov 96 06:45:27 PST

My '80 Westi has a flat spot in the acceleration at about 30 mph in 
second gear (CA engine with Hall effect distributor).  I don't have a 
tach to check what the RPM is.  I'm thinking that the distributor 
needs to be *cleaned* and *lubed*, can't hurt to do it.  My last 
distributor job didn't go very well and ended up at the shop for fix 
fixing.  Any advice on the following would be greatly appreciated.

How far to dismantle?
What to clean with?
What to lube with and how?
Other things to check, watch out for?

This dist came from the brown CA bus, and is now installed into my 
beige bus along with the other stuff to make it a CA engine.
If other parts from the brown bus is an indication, the distributor 
is original, has 200K on it and probably has not been maintained.
