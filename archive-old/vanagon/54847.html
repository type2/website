I noticed that you have a 96 TDI wagon.  We're thinking about trading
our 91 Passat wagon and sedan in for a TDI &quot;something&quot; - wagon or sedan,
not sure yet.  It seems that after we got the EV (for weekend
trips......), we ended up driving it all of the time, so we probably
have one too many cars.

Would you mind sharing some of your thoughts about the TDI?

Thanks,
