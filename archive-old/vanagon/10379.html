&gt;Well, I went shopping all the local magazine emporia I could think of,
&gt;and all I could find was a Brit magazine.  I didn't think this would
&gt;be very interesting since all of the adverts would be for across
&gt;the pond.  Where or how does one get a single copy of one of the US
&gt;rags to see if it's worth the subscription?

check the 24-hour grocery stores. if you can find Road &amp; Track, Motor Trend,
Car and Driver, Popular Science, etc., then they'll have the HOT VWs and
VW Trends somewhere in the auto mag section.

usually the mag/book stores in the malls have them also.

my opinion is that Hot VWs is 'better', with more bus stuff (but still not
much) while VW Trends is more chop-and-drop body shop oriented. :( but i get
both, on the off-chance that one of them will have some bus stuff. European
Car i get for the parts supplier ads ... none of the articles apply to me
(but my brother reads the rabbit/golf stuff).

good luck.

p.s i don't recall my old 71 running that high rpm at 60. from whence cometh
your bus? it's possible that the tranny has been rebuilt and the wrong gear
was used. or like somebody already said, you might have gotten that 'special'
mountain transmission ... or maybe a pickup truck transmission.
