List,

	I like the ideas of some listmembers reguarding a master computer to
moniter engine specs. My question, can a digital tach. be produced
inexpensively and if so what would it take. For instance, stationary
bikes have tachs that measure the rotation speed of the front tire.
Couldn't a digital meter of some sort be hooked into one of the plug
wires to measure RPM?
