Subject: Westfalia Sticker, came in.


I got the Westfalia Sticker in that I ordered.  I'm really happy with 
it.  Though, it is in separate letters, but that may be the way the 
origional ones are, I don't know.  I like the separate letters, just in 
case I put it on the front, where there is a screw that would inhibit a 
long, one-piece sticker.

I got the Charcoal color, and it is really neat.  Almost black, but has 
just a few sparkles in it.  The dark grey will match my curtains.

It's a really good deal for $9.  I think that they also come in black and 
red.  If anyone wants the info again you can find it in the archives, or 
I can send it out to you.

I have found that there is no standard placement, execept that it is 
always on the driver's side.  I've seen some on the back, front, and a 
few with both.

Anyway, after I repaint the pop-top I'll put it on.

later,

Kyle
