Uh oh. This happened to me! You don't really want to know what we did to
get it off, do you?

&gt;I've tried heating it, but no joy.
&gt;Any ideas?

Well, on Otto (a '59 with a ~'65 drivetrain) one drum came off fine. The
other, however was a bit recalcitrant. We tried heating. That didn't work.
We tried a puller, bent a whole bunch of lug nuts. That didn't work. We
tried heating AND pulling. That didn't work.

We wound up dismantling the reduction box. You can do this without removing
the drum for 8 (?) of the 9 (?) bolts. The last bolt is accessible only
with the drum removed, and we couldn't remove it. We drilled a hole through
the drum to access the bolt and voila, the box was disassembled. Now we had
a drum (with an extra hole in it), half a reduction box and everything in
between in a nice portable package to give to a machinist.

The machinist drilled a big hole parallel to the axle, right through the
drum to relieve whatever stress was built up in there. Finally, the thing
came off.

The drum, by the way, is trash now.

This is extreme, but keep it in mind if nothing else works.

Good luck,
Bob
