Subject: Buying in Germany?

All,

Hey there.  I'm living over in Barcelona, Spain and saving up mooney to buy
myself the  Westphalia of my dreams (88-91 ideally) when I return to the
States. From watching the list over a few days (and reading hundreds of
messages!!) it seems like there's a pretty limited supply in the US.  Does
anyone know what it's like to get one from Germany/Austria in terms of :

-cost
- problems with incompatability of parts, etc. once in USA
- more availability of 4X4 models in Germany/Austria?
- other?

because I have friends in Germany and on the Swiss Austrian border and it
would be an easy hop up there to get the van.

Any comments or info greatly appreciated.

Rich
