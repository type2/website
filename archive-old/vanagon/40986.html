Steve Maher concluded his message: &quot;P.S. Hey, at least I didn't mention that
density units are more properly
called slugs/ft^3.   :^)&quot;

Hey -  a REAL VW person would realize that VWs use metric measurements and
would have realized that consistent units for a metric vehicle would have been
Kilogram-Newton-Meter-units of measure!  &lt;G&gt;  

But then, Steve drives a hybrid, half metric, half SAE - so I guess we can cut
him some slack!  :-)
