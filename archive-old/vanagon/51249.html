Subject: On-board Charging.

Just a clarification, sorry folks...

 &gt; The Radio Shack store on my way to work does carry 10 amp diodes.
 &gt; Careful: a 10-amp Silicon Diode (as opposed to a Germanium diode,
 &gt; which has higher reverse current) will dissipate about 7 watts at full
 &gt; throttle (10 amps).  means it needs a heat sink so it does not form a
 &gt; health hazard.  I'd just keep the charger use it the way it is -- 3mA
I meant a health hazard as in burns due to a fire, or just due to
trying to hold the diode in your hand while operating.
