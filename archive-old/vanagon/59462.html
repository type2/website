Fellow list members,

I have the following problem:
The coolant expansion tank on my 85 GL has a couple hairline cracks by the
cap that allow coolant to escape under pressure.
Does anyone have suggestions for repairing this?
Are replacements expensive?
Is this a dealer only part?

Thanks,
Curtis Graham
