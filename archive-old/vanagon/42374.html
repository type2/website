Subject: Son of Corvair...


The guy with the Corvairs called again this morning to inform me that he
would accept my offer. Thought about it for a while, then I asked him how
he proposed to get the cars out of the woods so I could dismantle them. I
can't get a picker or a transmission jack anywhere near some of those cars
as they sit.

&quot;Well, don't you have a truck?&quot;

&quot;A truck won't do it. Those cars won't roll. You're gonna need a winch or a
tractor to get those out.&quot;

&quot;&lt;mumble&gt;&quot;

If he has to pay somebody to pull them out into the clearing, I expect
it'll queer the deal. He'll just let the junk man winch them out and send
them on their way. Four complete Corvair engines off to the beer can
factory. :( But it ain't over yet, he said he'd call if he found somebody
to pull them out.
