If you guys make anything that needs covering, don't use velour from the 
fabric store.  I covered a custom rear window dash and door panels for a 
Fastback with it, and by the end of summer, it had turned to a 
brownish-grey color.  When I redid them, I purchased vinyl and cloth from 
an automotive/boat upholstery shop.  It was the same price per foot as 
the cloth I bought at the fabric store, but had much better environmental 
resistance qualities.

&gt; I am installing several gauges.  Which ones should I be sure to include?
&gt; Which ones don't I need.
&gt; 
&gt; I built a box thingee that sits on my dash right next to the instrument
&gt; cluster and that holds my stereo and up to 5 gauges.  I covered it with the
&gt; same foam backed fabric my dash mat is made out of -- ordered it from the
&gt; company -- and it looks pretty good.  No I just have to fill it up.  Oh,
&gt; and fix the engine...
