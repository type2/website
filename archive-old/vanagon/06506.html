        When all is said and done it would be helpful if someone could post
a short digest of the trip(s) with estimated dates..  I rarely know what
i'm doing from one day to the next but i often find myself out on the road
just for fun.
        thanks. CHUCK

Chuck - the dates for the Pfeiffer Big Sur (west) convergence are
Jan. 6, 7, &amp; 8, a weekend.  

David Schwarze has a proposed itenary of our mass brick tour for
spring/summer, which I'm sure he'd be happy to mail you...
