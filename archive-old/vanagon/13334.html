&gt;From Frank Trehaar...

Clips to reattach the front rubber to my bumper that some moron tore off  0.61ea
&gt;

my dealer wanted $3.95 Cdn per clip, looks like the Canadian dollar is 
racing the peso to the ground.

Please advise when you have reverse engineered that harness, as my friendly 
parts guy wants $191.00 Cdn for it, grumble.

thanks, tim s.
