&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; I had heard/thought that the Eberspacher BA 6 heater was offered as an
&gt; option on  Vanagon Westies well into the wasserboxer era.  Can anybody out
&gt; there confirm this or give me a definitive &quot;no&quot;?
&gt; 
&gt; If the answer is &quot;no&quot;, has anybody successfully transplanted one?
&gt; 
&gt; TIA
&gt; 
&gt; -TomI Have an '82 Vanagon Diesel Westie, and it has the auxillary heater. 
(Diesel version) Talk about the best of all worlds.._dot_decent water 
heating, plus the 15,000 btu aux.  I don't know if anyone has ever tried 
transplanting one of these units into another vehicle.
