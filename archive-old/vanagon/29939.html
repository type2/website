vs keeping his fool injection.

I add:

The PPO (previous previous owner did the same thing when the brain went
dead, in the early eighties(i guess the parts were more expensive then
due to the lack of donor busses). Once I finally figure out the tuning
details, just bought a book called af all things &quot;Weber Carburetors&quot; by
Pat Braden. The publisher is HPBooks, and if I am not mistaken it is the
same publisher that does &quot;How to Hot Rod your VW&quot; and &quot;How to Rebuild
your VW engine&quot; (I think).  But anyways they make mention of the use of
Weber Carbs on VWs so I am sure it will help.
I just finished a 3700 mile trip in my 79 Westy, and I have to say the
Carb and engine performed almost flawlessly, and to top it off, I had a
hard time keeping it below the speed limit! 8-0 go figure!

I removed the Carb, and intake manifold while doing some work on the
engine with no trouble, I shouldn't think it would be too hard to do the
conversion yourself, once you get an electric fuel pump.

Good Luck,

David
