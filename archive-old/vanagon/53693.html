RE:	Copy of: American Quilt and a VW Bus

&gt;I think it was a early 60's barn door splittie with the canvas roof in
&gt;the middle of the passenger bay. The end of the movie was a nice tight
&gt;shot of two characters in the bus with the barn doors open and then the
&gt;camera falls back. A nice vw ending :)

Hi,  Mr. Correct Terminology here, again....  booo...  hiss.....  :&lt;)
A &quot;Barndoor&quot; bus is a term used for all buses produced from 1950-1955.  That's
it. 
all '56 up buses are NOT Barndoors.  Quite a few people improperly call all
splitties &quot;Barndoors&quot; because of their dual cargo doors. The cargo doors are
called just that, cargo doors. The &quot;Barndoor&quot; refers to the MONGO sized engine
decklid on the '50-'55 buses. The '50-'55's had no rear hatch, and so the
decklid went all the way up to the tiny back window. You could fit a family of 5
in the engine compartment of a Barndoor bus.......  :&lt;)
