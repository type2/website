&gt;Okay the Oxygen Sensor Light has been on for a year now and it's bugging me.
&gt;Bently says the reset is behind one of the head lights for an 87 Syncro.
&gt;I can't find it!? Anybody got any clues as were to look????

On my 84GL, the O2 idiot light switch is activated by a clock mechanism,
which driven by the same cable that drives the speedo (cable goes from
front wheel to clock, and then from clock to speedo).

The clock box has a button on it.  Mash it - and presto, everything is set
for another 30K miles.

I assume it is similar on an 87 synchro, but they probably drive off the
front differential or something like that.  The clock box on the 84 is
underneath the van, but it makes sense that it is moved somewhere else on a
synchro.  I'd look for the box behind the driver's side headlight (just
guessing).

Let me know how it goes.
