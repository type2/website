Subject: Re: engine change



I'm biting the bullet and getting a rebuilt engine for my '86 vanagon 
from VW. I have the bently and was wondering if there are any tips on 
removing the engine. I have dropped air-cooled engines but this is my 
first waterboxer. Does anybody know what gaskets and sealants that I 
will need for this? 
Please reply direct as I am on digest mode due to work hours ( both 
jobs and school)
TIA
