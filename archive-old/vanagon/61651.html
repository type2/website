Subject: Engine for '86???

My friends have an '86 that LOOKS great, but has caused considerable
problems...still, they love it because, well, they do.

Something about the engine being made out of two different metals???  

Anyhow, I said I'd look for an engine for them -- preferably NOT from an '86.
 Maybe an '83 to rebuild, or one already rebuilt and guaranteed???

They live in Pennsylvania.

Nancy
