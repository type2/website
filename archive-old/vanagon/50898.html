Anyone ever heard of Tim McDermott? I havn't seen him on the list
before. Does he know it's Friday? hummm... I wonder. He seemed a little
too sorry about his message not being VW related.

        If you ask me I wouldn't give this company any info. If Tim's a list
member than my apologies, but it sounds to me like a scam within a scam.

just keeping everyone safe,

The company that I work for distributed the same information about a month 
ago.  Actually, your not giving much information compared with the info that 
LEXIS-NEXIS has.  I thought it was strange to see non-business related info 
on a memo.  Anyway, now that I've seen it twice I'm gonna contact 
LEXIS-NEXIS and get my name of their list.  In the dawn of the age of 
information, I'm gonna try to control what I can.
