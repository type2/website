&gt; &gt; Coincidentally, last night I was under the bus replacing brake lines.

&gt; &gt; are much better, but alas, I will have to adjust the stars 
&gt; &gt; tonight, as the thing is still pulling very hard to the right.

&gt; What I find funny is that it seems like all split window busses have 
&gt; problems with the brakes.  :)  I want to replace everything on mine in 
&gt; the hope that t'll stop pulling to the right, and to stop the leaking 
&gt; master cylinder.  Does ANYONE on this list have a splitty with perfect 
&gt; brakes?

My splitty has perfect brakes, once I stop hard a couple of times. The problem 
is that if I leave the beast sitting around for a month or more and then go to 
stop, it usually pulls hard to the right.  I think that the shoes might stick to
the drums a little, or maybe some brake fluid's getting in there. Whatever the 
case, a few good hard stops usually &quot;machines&quot; the drums/shoes so that 
subsequenst stops are fine.  If I drive it every day I don't get the problem.

BTW, I've got a '65 (single master cylinder), and crusty old brake lines.
