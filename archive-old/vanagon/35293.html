Subject: Re: Retry on the map send

The two times this map was sent, my vanagon digest was about 200K (it is 
normally about 40-45K)  and it
had only two messages in it.  One of them was the map, the other was a 
regular post.  PLEASE don't send images like that.  Maybe if someone 
wants the image they can let you know and you can mail it directly to 
their mailbox, but it really nukes my mail system and I can't read my 
vanagon digest when images are sent.

Am I alone in this problem?

Thanks,
Craig
