, then Rt. 2 over to Maine, very scenic. 


Trust me this road is slow going, but it is beautiful Sean and Lee Ann are
right.

, Bar Harbor south will be an incredible drive and you 
&gt;will want to stop every everywhere.  

Too bad you can't come just a little more North to Canada.

In Portland, Maine I would recommend Jerry Settle in South Portland. I
don't have his number, but he saved my ass with a set of new brushes in
May.



In New Hampshire, on route 3 in North Woodstock is the Tufts Mountain
Club(aka the loj), there's usually people there on the week-ends and
they're very friendly. I always stay there for about $8 a night. It's a
huge old farm house with about 90 bunks. If you can stand alot of under
grads and mention my name as an old fart there, they should be pretty
receptive. It's right on the edge of white Mtn National park. There's no
street address, but it's right across the road from the general store, just
ask they'll point it out. I spent many hours there fixing my first westy in
the barn there.


Best of luck,
andrew
