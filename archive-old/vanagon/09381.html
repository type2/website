Subject: Re: CV Boots, accel &amp; clutch cables


	Ok,
	The general consensus seems to be:

	(1 was how to inspect tranny mount)

	2: Do all 4 CVS

	3: Replace clutch and accel cables.

	3.5: Replace throw-out bearing, inspect cross-shaft bushings, 
	replace as needed. Eg do *complete* clutch job, since everything
	else is new.

	4: Naval Jelly/prime/paint heavy rust, or wire brush and 
	Krylon Rust Tough. Detail the whole engine compartment.
	Clean, clean, clean!

	4.5 Check and renew as needed all motor mounts.

	5.0 Replace ground straps and primary electrical cables
	to/from battery as needed. This is an excellent point.

	There *IS* a piece of sheet-metal under the pedals and master
	cylinder, etc. More stuff for the long-term list.

	Thanks to Joel, Thom, JHopp and Steven Johnson

	Time for me to start planning my weekend-after-Pfiefer!
