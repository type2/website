Subject: engine seal/tin holes

ih!

I will aks this, even though I am pretty sure what the answer from any competant 
VW owner will be:

How goodly does the air seal(y'know...those airborne mammalian blobs)need to 
seal?  Mine is good in some areas, yet is bent weirdly or has gaps in some 
areas...I know it is for to keep the nasty hot air from the exhaust, etc. from 
coming up and getting blown back through the *cooling* system, but how much is 
good enuff?  Also, I have noticed holes (up to 1/4 in. diameter) in a few places 
on the tin...should I find something to cover or plug them with?

On that note (C#) I would also like to further my edyookashun by asking:  &quot;Does 
and &quot;81 2000cc FI Vanagon engine have an idiot light for overheating?&quot;

Any advice will be taken to heart....thanks!
