&gt;Where were the digital displays mounted for the BBW 46  CDN Eberspacher
&gt;watercooled gas heater?
&gt;
&gt;Hey Tim Smith - you've got a BBW 46 (you lucky dog!!)  Where is the 

Yup, too bad the DPO gutted all the plumbing, and the mech who did it for
him put all the parts in the trash after keeping them for a year, (howls of
anguish here, pls)  It's made by Webasto, and any wasserboxer wanting a
camping furnace ought to seriously look at one of these units.  
The digital control is by my left knee, just under the air vent.  About
3&quot;x2&quot;high, smaller LCD screen with 4 buttons in a row under, and a couple of
LEDS either side of screen. The mounting housing fits dash perfectly and is
very much OEM style.  Controller slide/clips in.

  Can't figure what the '88 widget is either, remote head for a radar
detector the owner didn't hide very well?  I have a Cobra 'Trapshooter Pro'
that fits that description, but the head is well hidden in a low parcel
shelf, under a lid with the audio response turned up loud.  The provincial
Gestapo frown on such things. ($500 frowns)  bye all, tim
