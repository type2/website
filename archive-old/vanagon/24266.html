Subject: Re: safety/liability questions

&gt; What I am wondering/needing is some feelings on how individual people
&gt; make decisions to compensate for the obvious design comprimises that
&gt; some types of vehicles have.  For instance, has anyone ever noticed
&gt; that a VW bus has a short nose?  How do you compensate for this when you
&gt; drive?  Or do you?  

When wedrovein our buswhen I was little, I remember my father telling me 
to pick up my feet if it ever appeared that we were going to be in a 
front end accident. I have since seen busses that have their noses caved 
in, it looks likethey hold up pretty well structurally.
