Subject: Syncro Driveshaft Universal Joints 

I located the vibration that I was searching for in my drivetrain. It seems
the rear universal in the driveshaft was drier the dry and scorched beyond
repair. That was the good news, I had feared it was a trans. problem. The
bad news is I spent 2 hours on the phone and none of the FLAPS have any
replacements . They all insisted that this Vehicle has no universal joints.
Does anyone know of a suitable replacement or have a part #. VOA wants well
over $145- EACH. Ouch.
