Subject: Re: Why don't AT's have a drain plug?

&gt;Can someone give me a good explaination as to why Vanagon (and other) 
&gt;automatic transmissions dont have a drain plug. Seems it would be a lot 
&gt;easier to change fluid than dropping the whole pan off and have less of 
&gt;an environmental impact (gee you should see my garage floor).	
&gt;
&gt;What about drilling a hole in the AT pan at the lowest point, welding a 
&gt;big nut on it and installing a drain plug?
&gt;
&gt;
Because they want to stick you for the gasket and the filter every fluid change.
As to the second item, my father in law does this all the time.  He uses 
pipe threads and a plug.  I seem to remember the last one leaking, though.
