Subject:      news about the Bago-bus! (the winnebago-VW eurovan campers)

ok, folks ... for those of you interested in checking out the new Winnebago
versions of the VW eurovan campers, get the July 94 issue of Motor Trend
(where they 'test' the VW camper version against a bunch of other 'just-vans'.
they didn't like it).
for the bigger (and much more expensive) Winnebago camper version (called the
Rialta), July 94 issue of Motorhome magazine has some ads for it. also call
Winnebago for info:
1-800-643-4892       or  (515) 582=3535
or write
Winnebago Information Services
P.O. Box 152, Dept. A074
Forest City, IA 50436

it (the Rialta) is 21 feet long, and has a rooftop a/c (like the big boys)
and a bathroom. :) but it's pretty heavy, i think. and runs about $40,000.

* Say you want something Really Neat, but Cheaper?? *
*****************************************************
say no more, wink, wink, nudge, nudge.
in the Classified section of Motorhome (July 94) is this ad:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
18' European VW LT40D 1985.
6 cyl diesel, dual rear wheels, 18 mpg, 5-speed man, A/C, P/S, 2 batteries,
winch, sleeps 5, stove, frig, sink, hot water, furnace, full bath, awning,
much storage, self-contained, many extras.  Unique, must see.
$25,000.  (201) 997-4083 (New Jersey)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the acccompanying picture is pretty neat: for those of you who don't know what
an LT is, it is a VW truck. looks rather like a Vanagon (in body style), but
the grill is slightly different and the windshield if a bit larger. anyway,
this picture shows the camper. looks like about 20+ feet long, high roof
camper top (does not look like it pops up ... probably doesn't need to) at
least 9 feet tall. huge 7&quot; driving and fog lights (gee! i like those. ;) and
a full front bush guard setup (the bars that protect the radiator and lights
from trees and bushes out in the boondocks. or Kamikazi armadillos/raccoons/
deer/etc.). the winch (sorry, it is the electrical type) is in the middle of
the front bumper). big sliding door. what appears to be a luggage rack area
on the rear end of the high roof.

if you like big buses, you'll love this one! it really looks neat. hmmmmmmmm.
where's that dammed lottery when i really need it!! :)
