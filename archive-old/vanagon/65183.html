Subject:      Parts Hunt - 77 Westy

I am hoping my fellow listees can help me out with this.

My brother-in-law is looking for a right side heater box (new or used) for
his '77 type II Westy.  He is very price sensitive.  Any guidance, tips,
parts sources, etc. would be greatly appreciated.

If anyone out there can provide me with the address to the type II list, I
would like to ask there as well.

Thanks
