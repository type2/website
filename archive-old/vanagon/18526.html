Subject: Re: Mill Supply Came Through - same part for 1/3 Bus Boys/RMMW

&gt;	Some times you just HAVE to laugh! HAAAAAAAA!!! WAAAAA!!!
&gt;
&gt;	For those of you who haven't been following this story, the
&gt;part in question is the battery tray for a 1970 single cab pickup-
&gt;a slightly different part than the normal Transporter battery tray.
&gt;
&gt;	So I got home last night and there it was on my porch,
&gt;the package from Mill Supply. And in it, the same dark-red primered,
&gt;30mm too narrow battery shelf that I bought from Bus Boys!!! But
&gt;Bus Boys wanted $75 for it and Mill Supply charged me $25!!!!
&gt;(Rocky Mountian Motor Works charges $70)
&gt;
&gt;	So I've got a spare, or one to swap or something.
&gt;
&gt;	Both have a tag on them under the reseller's tag which
&gt;indicates that TAPCO made the actual part. Anyone know of TAPCO? 
&gt;They presumably *really* make this stuff, wonder what their prices
&gt;are?
&gt;
&gt;	Anyway, the long wait is over, I'll try and get my neighbor
&gt;started on modifying the piece (and take pictures and dimensions)
&gt;and get it installed and get on the road already!!
&gt;
&gt;	All that to get the same part?!?! What a goof I feel like!
&gt;       cheers!

Bill,
I bought a generic plastic tray from Kragen for about $4.00, it has all
kinds of cool slots and things to screw it down and strap the battery into it.
