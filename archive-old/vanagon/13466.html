    Ok Folks,
    
      My son (13) had a hissy fit last night about NuBus ('82 Diesel).
    These were some of his quotes:
    
     &quot;I Hate that freaking car&quot;
    
     &quot;It's so ugly&quot;
    
     &quot;It's so loud&quot;  &quot;It's so stupid&quot;  &quot;I'd rather walk&quot;
    
    He is embarrassed when he is seen in the bus; not
    because of its condition, but because it is a VW.
    
    He threatened to ignore us if we picked him from the 
    school dance tonight in the bus...
    
    So, am I alone with this? Any net.experience on remoulding
    recalcitrant posterity?
