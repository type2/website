Subject: 71 will start!!!!!!!

no ound could be so sweet as those few coughs and then the humm of my new
engine after 30 days of rebuild it ran.  thanks for all the help when i got
it in and it would not start.  The problem was the distributer.  I followed
photos of the old engine and that distributer was wrong now my #1 nick on the
distrib is #2 and #1 fires where # 4 is sounds strange but just 180 off Oh
well it runs great.  The battle wagon lives. Its alive! It alive!

Thanks again for the help!!!
