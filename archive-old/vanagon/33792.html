Hi all!

Well last night I decided to get the westy going and give her a bath.
Yes, here in Pittsburgh the snow finally melted and the flood waters
went back down. I was elected to drive to the Superbowl party on Sunday
(GO STEELERS!!!) and figured we should go in style ;). So I go out and
check the oil, she's a leaker, climb in, give the pedal a few pumps and
hit the key. The engine didn't roll over twice before she was purring, a
sweet sound. This was the first time I ran it since before Christmas. I
rode it around for a while, with a big smile then gave her a bath... I
guess the point behind all this babbling is how much I missed driving it
for the last month. Anyway I'm still smilin'.

R.J.

 
                                GO STEELERS!!!!!!
