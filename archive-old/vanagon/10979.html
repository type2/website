&gt; This morning on the way to work, I stopped at a convenience store for gas
&gt; just outside Flagstaff. 
[snip]
&gt; A regular impromptu Bus club meeting!  This place is out there
&gt; aways, so it's unusual to get three people getting gas at the same time,
&gt; let alone three Bus owners!
&gt; 

Sounds like we could have a weekly bus-in at Little America!
Verde Valley would be better though, so us flatlanders don't 
have as much hill to climb!

Ah do ahll mah own werk, too! (putt-putt-putt-pfft)
