Subject: Re: Add-on Oil Coolers

Those barbed hoses with clamps are the worst.
After dumping two quarts of oil in the drive way on two different occasions I
went over to West Sac. to where they repair big trucks.  For under $30 I
eliminated all hose clamped lines, and replaced them with High pressure
hydralic line using AN-8 (used on A/C) fittings and swedged on ends.  A
couple of years later I eliminated the whole damn mess and went back to
stock.
I have found that an external cooler won't help overheating, just delay
reaching overheated, by virtue of there being more oil to heat.
I have also found that an oilcooler on a new strong well running engine is a
waist, takes motor longer to warm up, leaks. hoses in the way.
Most of the stuff in the mags are there because they sell, they don't give a
ship about your engine.
