&gt; Hey Dennis WE have to talk.
&gt;  I would never abuse my Syncro. It's just that I get my use out of
&gt;  My vehicles. I no, I will find myself in the middle of the woods and
&gt;  have a need to get some work of some kind done.Therefore I want to
&gt;  no it's limitations. I keep my vehicles in top shape! tuned to the
&gt;  max., oil changed every 3000, washed every week, Engine detailed
&gt;  once a year. Brake fluid PS fluid flushed once a year. and on and on.
&gt;  I don't plain on this stump pulling every day on any regular basis.
&gt;
&gt;  BY the way -- I'm going to replace the fluid in the trans.  Can you
&gt;  recomment a brand?  Also I think I better check the front axel. Is
&gt;  that fluid the same?

Okay, so maybe I was a little harsh.  My experience with the Syncro is that
the transaxle is a weak link.  Consider the following:

The basic transmission is a design that was originally intended to be used in
&lt;3000lb vehicle being pushed by a 50hp(if lucky) engine.  This was back in
68.  The basic trans has changed only slightly since then.

A fully loaded Syncro Camper wieghs about 4500lbs, 5500 max loaded.  the
engine puts out approx 90hp.  This is a about double the load the trans was
originaly designed.  Early busses never needed trans work.  72-79 busses go
about 100 to 160K on a trans.  Non Syncro Vanagns rarely go much over 100K
and I've seen Syncros blow them up before 60K.  In fact, i own an 87 I
purcahsed with 58K and a big hole in the bottom og the low gear housing.  The
ring and pinion had no teeth.  

now, for pulling stumps!  Lets say the engine can produce 100ftlb of
torque,(it doesn't, but reving and droping clutch can make much more due to
flywheel inertia), and the creeper gears have a ratio of 6 to 1,(about
right),  that is 600 ft lbs of torque being applied to the ring and pinion.
 Now the ring and pinion is about another 6 to 1, (actually 5.84?).  600 X 6=
 3600ft lbs of torque to the axles.

So we go to pull a stump, we need low gear, we attach van to stump, we rev
engine and let out clutch.  One of five things have to happen:  Engine
stalls, (likely),  all four wheels, slipp,( not likely, especially if diff
lock is used), Clutch slips and burns up, chain snaps or hitch falls off, or
transmission breaks!  Low gear assembly will probably fail first.  Bad part
of this, is that when this happens, trans will probably not be rebuildable.

Anyway, I use my Syncros for towing cars on occaision.  You need to be very
careful how you work these vehicles.  Your first trans failure can set you
back enogh to buy a clunker jeep and not have the grief of fixing the
Vanagon.  There is a difference between towing on the road and pulling things
through the woods.  Off road driving is tough on the vehicle already.

I fill my gearboxes with Mobil 1 75-90 synthetic gear oil.  If you wil abuse
trans, you may consider the 75-140.  This will provide some extra protection,
but shifting will be more difficult.  Especially in cold weater.  I'm not
saying Mobil is best. I use it due to availability and name brand.  
Dennis.
