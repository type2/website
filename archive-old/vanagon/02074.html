&gt;   der Bus - a 1980 vanagon. had the name in old English letters on the side.
&gt;             (best bus i ever had, even if it wasn't air conditioned)
&gt;   Blitzfahrt - a 1974 Porsche 914 with a hole in its muffler
&gt;   Humpback, the Quasi-Motor of Noted Fame - a 1968 double-cab pickup truck.
