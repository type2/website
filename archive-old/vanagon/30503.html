Subject: Coolant Leaks Underneath

I have an 85 VW Vanagon GL.  I replaced the waterpump last weekend 
due to a major leak. (Also replaced thermostat since I was in there)
 In that process, I attempted to clean the hose 
connections, etc around the engine to prevent any leaks.

However, whenever there is a strong drop in temperature, I get a 
minor amount of coolant on the ground.  I have always assumed this to 
be just hose / fitting leaks.  Could this be something bigger?

At this time, I get a small amount just underneath the hose 
connections for the waterpump and a tiny amount underneath the left 
rear corner of the engine.  In extreme temp drops, I see a little 
underneath the spare tire, just behind the radiator and hose 
connections.  I have often looked at the engine and cylinders to see 
if it was coming off of that and have never noticed any tell tale 
signs.  Are there any?

This rarely is a problem when it is warm and dry in the spring and 
summer.  Only in the fall and winter when we see 20 or 30 degree temp drops 
from high to low.

Also, I have attempted to get the &quot;head gasket leaks&quot; &amp; the &quot;more 
head gasket leaks&quot; info from the gopher address given via the Vanagon 
Web Page but it returns an error.  If anyone has these faq's and can 
forward them, I'd love to read them.

BTW:  I belong to the BMWCCA which has a &quot;Friends of BMWCCA&quot; booklet 
listing people in various cities who are willing to help out a member 
in a crunch.  I've volunteered for that list and I'm willing to 
assist anyone in the Dallas / Ft Worth area on this Vanagon list as well.  Just contact me 
for a phone number.

Thanks in advance.
