Subject: Re: ?? Power for stereo in my '86 Vanagon

In a message dated 96-03-19 04:55:28 EST, you write:

&gt;Ironically, I *don't* like the headlights to shut off when I shut off the
&gt;engine. The '71 bus and the '80 are the first cars I've ever owned that did
&gt;that. I will re-wire the V6anagon soon, and find another switched-power
&gt;source for the radio.
&gt;
&gt;

I urge you not to rewire your vanagon's headlights.  They headlight circuit
gets its power from the X terminal on your ignition switch.  This circuit (X
headlight) controls your X-relay.  Your X-relay makes all of the unneccessary
consumers shut down while the starter engages (wiper motor, dash fan, turn
signals, etc.).  Be aware that if you wire your headlights to come on if the
ign switch is off, so will your wipers, dash fan, turn signals, A/C
compressor clutch, etc.etc...  Is it worth it to you to add that much risk to
finding a dead vehicle in the deserted parking lot?  Just my two cents.
