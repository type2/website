Subject: 302 little 302...

	Nobody asked but here's the add anyway:

	VW '82 Vanagon 302 V8 Pantera tran. fast $5800 (408) 479 1886

	Guess that would solve any potential drive train strength
problem. It COULD be smog legal too- use a contemporary mass-flow-sensor
FI '5 liter'  Mustang engine. Say, David Schwartz- this could simplify
your maintenance parts list....


	Dean &amp; Opie sent me a 'chin up, boy' message regarding the '69 single
cab. Thanks Dean!. Mostly, yeah, I want one that works NOW. But mine
IS one year newer :) Thanks for the support. Of course, it would
be nice to own more than one :)

	Cheers!
	Bill
