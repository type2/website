&gt; &gt;Well, if yer referring to the old stalling on the long drive at 
&gt; constant
&gt; &gt;speeds, then you are referring to Technical Bulletin # 92-01 Vanagon 
&gt; &gt;Intermittent Misfire which is for all Vanagon Digifant Fuel Injection
&gt; &gt;Engines.

I had similar experiences with both my '82 and '91 Vanagon's, ie. severe 
bucking and finally stalling completely, after the engine had been 
running smoothly for some time.  In both cases the problem was due to 
loose engine/tranny/chassis ground wires.  Apparently, having anything 
less than an impeccable ground circuit can cause the FI system to get 
false readings, resulting in a bad fuel mixture and rough running.  In 
both cases, removing the ground straps (there are several) and cleaning 
the connections fixed the problem.  

I did on one other occasion have a similar problem with the '82 that was 
traced to a bad O2 sensor connection, so you might want to check that too.
