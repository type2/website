Well, it is a little quiet today so I thought I would pass along some 
info.  Last night I went out to discover that my right rear tire was 
flat.  I honestly assumed that one of the neighborhood kids had done 
it.  I figured I would pump it up with my bike pump and then run to 
the gas station to top it off.  Well, turns out the valve core was 
leaking.  It was slow so I was still able to get it to the station and
replace the core.  Didn't cost a dime either!  Just when I was losing 
faith in humans.  :)  So the moral is the story is to maybe carry an 
extra valve stem core and tool in the old tool box.  Or maybe just 
replace them every couple of years.  I am assuming the recent cold 
weather here finally did in this one.  Jim
