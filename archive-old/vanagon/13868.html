Hi, all. That Tulare rest stop is just marked as rest stop, as in: Rest
Stop, 2 Miles. It has no showers, but it has vending machines with more
travel goods (toothbrushes, bic shavers, shower caps,etc.) than anyone would
ever need. Plenty of lawn, lots of parking, and probably a whole bunch of
semi trucks parked overnight with their compressors running.

Sorry I can't make it to the desert with the group, but if you're planning a
gas/pit stop in Bakersfield, please let me know. Beach Park at 99 and 178 is
a good stop, and there's gas stations all around there.
