Subject: David Schwarze's site

Hi all,
I've been poking around in David Schwarze's Web Site, down loading various
pictures and stuff (Making myself envious of the various west coast van 
trips).  Any way, I grabbed a bunch of pictures, and the first 
Martha_stuck.mpg.
The pictures all turned out well on my gif/jpg viewer, but the mpg was
impossible to watch, jumping and thrashing all about.  It was my first
time using the mpg viewer, so I don't know if it is my software or the
file. (or if it got corrupted in downloading).  Has anybody else had
any trouble with this file?  Has anybody else downloaded it?

  Do you mean the &quot;driving&quot; one? I FTP'd/snagged it and between the
  jerkiness of the MPEG (what is it, like 14 frames per second?) and
  the bumpiness of the road, it is kind of hard to watch. I got a real
  kick out of it, though... imagine having someone see these in a hundred
  years... &quot;Gosh, that was a Vanagon!&quot; The one with Ms. Rubin's ride
  being pushed from wherever it was stuck is a lot more fluid and easy
  to watch. Very nice web pages! I like to look at the shots of his
  dash... gotta add some gauges to my '76... yes yes...

   Is this sstones as in your name or as in Seastones? Why am I at
   work today if I'm in the states???
