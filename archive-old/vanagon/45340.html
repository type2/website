Subject: Re: Eye doctor and Navigating the Westy

Well on a completely unrelated topic...

I think these drops should be standard VW issue when buying any new or used 
bus/vanagon/etc.

On the weekend while camping, Caron managed to sit on her glasses and completely 
destroy the frames.  This wasn't an immediate emergency since she rarely wears 
them (always wears contacts).  Well yesterday we managed to smoke up the kitchen 
pretty good while cooking dinner.  As a result, Caron's contacts were really 
burning her eyes so she had to take them out.

Right about then I decided to take Lief for a drive to see how much fuel pressure 
I was getting through my new fuel filter (I now have 2 magnets stuck to the tank).  
So Caron decided to come along.

So to make a short story excrutiatingly long, this is one of the first times I 
didn't get any comments about my driving abilities or choice of routes (she can't 
see a book in front of her face never mind another car on the road).

So where can I get these eye drops Mr. VanBondo?  They might come in handy on long 
road trips.

P.S.  That brand-spanking new fuel filter lasted a grand total of 24 hours.  So I 
guess I'll be pulling the tank ASAP.  Don't think I can afford to go through a 
filter every day.
