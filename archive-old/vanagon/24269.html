&gt; &gt; &gt; My '78 (Murray) is braking rather irregularly these days. After long
&gt; &gt; &gt; highway sections (infrequent braking) the brake pedal sinks rather
&gt; &gt; &gt; close to the floor without producing much stopping power. The problem
&gt; &gt; &gt; is resolved after a pump or two when brake pressure is returned.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Mark, have you been losing brake fluid?  Any wetness anywhwere in the 
&gt; &gt; braking system that might indicate a leak in the system?  Wheel 
&gt; &gt; cylinders, master cylinders, couplings in the lines?  Check the whole 
&gt; &gt; length of the lines, too, since you may have chucked a rock or something 
&gt; &gt; up on the logging roads and damaged something.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'd be freaking if my pedal would drop to the floor every now and then!

&gt; Tobin,
&gt; 
&gt; No loss of brake fluid that I have noticed. I will get underneath and
&gt; have a thorough look. The rear wheel cylinders are new last fall. Sean
&gt; Stueber says on August 16...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I had to adjust mine several (about three, I think) times before the problem
&gt; &gt; went away.  You problem sounds exactly like mine.  I think the reason is that
&gt; &gt; when you adjust them it actually only adjusts one side.  Over the next few
&gt; &gt; minutes/hours/days of driving the shoes center themselves and require
&gt; &gt; adjusting again.  Give it a try.  Good luck
&gt; 
&gt; I re-adjusted the rear brakes 2 weeks ago and proceeded on a 2 week
&gt; wind surfing holiday. The rough roads and long freeway sections did not
&gt; cause the problem to reappear yet. One other symptom is that the brake
&gt; pedal will drop slightly under pressure as if something suddenly
&gt; releases, and I can hear a clunk from the rear when this happens
&gt; (usually only after a long period of driving without braking).

Clunk?  You thinking then that that's the shoes popping into the 
'centred' position after rattling into a non-centred position on your 
long freeway drive?  Have you popped off the rear brake drums to have a 
look at the guts of your rear brakes?  Is your braking even when you do 
use them?  (i.e., one wheel of the other, or fronts only/rears only locks 
up under moderate braking on those logging roads?)
