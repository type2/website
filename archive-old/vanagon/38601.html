&gt;&gt;58 Microbus   5  67 Microbus  22
&gt;              19             +110=129 out of 125 &lt;G&gt;

uhhhhhh ... last time *I* looked 1+3+4+2+5 = 15, not 19. ;)

&gt;&gt; Microbus 125 - Camper  32, Panel   10, Pickup  23, Kombi   15, Deluxe  23
&gt;103 Buses out of 125, where/what are the other 22 buses? Firebuses?

well ... there's the Standard buses and the ones that nobody told me anything
but the year. not ALL buses are categorized in the summary.

&gt;&gt; Bus      215 - Camper 129, Panel    1, Pickup   5, Kombi    5
&gt;140 out of 215 here, umm 75 must be spectic tanks &lt;G&gt;

same thing. OF the 215, buses, 129 are campers, 1 is panel, etc.

&gt;&gt; Vanagon  270 - Camper 135, Panel    1, Pickup   1, Diesel  16, Syncro  35
&gt;188/270 man 82 bricks could build one big house.

etc.

&gt;&gt; Eurovan   23 - Camper   8, Panel    0, Pickup   0, Diesel   1
&gt;9/23 wowsers

same thing. if it's not a camper, panel, pickup or diesel, it's not split
out as a separate category.

&gt;Guess that means we have a TON of un-classifed buses, huh?

well, considering that most buses weigh MORE than 2000 lbs, i'd say there's
a lot more than that!! maybe a few tons of UNKNOWNS!!! :)

there now, you Unknowns see what sort of trouble you guys get me into??? :)

sigh. my work has never been truly appreciated. :(
