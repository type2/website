huh, wa.  Well I'll be I never knew that.  Thanks.

Now as to why this happens.  Actually it is fairly straight forward.  The
short story is:

The electric window relay is energized by the load reduction relay, and

The high beam flasher circuit energizes the load reduction relay thru the
light switch if the light switch is turned on.

I can send a complete point by point description later, but it is all there on
the page in Bently.  I note that it will work on any vehicle that has power
windows AND a load reduction relay.

If you just have to know faster than I can get to my notes, e-mail me, and
I'll do it sooner rather than later.  squeeky wheel and all that.
