Subject: Re: air scoops on splitties

Eric,
	I get about 10% better fuel economy and quicker down hill cooling 
with air scoops on my '67 bus( I have a '66 that I like stock).  A big 
problem I have with the old buses is the amount of dust and crud that 
gets sucked into the engine compartment due to the low location of the 
air vents. This gets kicked up mostly from the front tires.  The higher 
air intakes starting in '68 picks up cleaner, cooler air.  I fiberglassed 
the cheap plastic scoops that I bought and and they have survived a lot 
of bashing by bushes and bovines.  Gary Gibson
