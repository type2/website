Subject: Re: Pop Top seal replacement

&gt;-- [ From: Gary Clayton * EMC.Ver #2.5.02 ] --
&gt;I bought a seal kit (pop-top part $70, luggage rack, or stationary part $30)
&gt;from an ad in one of the VW/T&amp;A magazines.
&gt;I can find the info. for you if you wish, but the ad is usually there.
&gt;

Would you be able to dig that up for me?  I bought my '78 Westy this fall
and it was missing the rubber seal for the pop-top. Although it rarely rains
in Vancouver in the winter (cough, gasp, choke, laugh) I have water leaking in.

If they have a phone number, that would help me most.

Thanx for your help, and happy new year from the great winter desert of the
north.

Glen.
