	One point here is that the core deposit means nothing if your trans is
really toasted as you said. Most shops will not refund your core. They
claim core depost will be refunded if &quot;rebuildable&quot; core is exchanged. You
can just about forget about the deposit in most cases. (Some cores are
really worthless, but I bet good cores are scamed from unknowing people.)
Also, Parts Place ships the work out to someone else, so not only do you
have to pay them to be the middle man, but they really don't have much
control over core policy. Either try to find another syncro to part out or
take it apart yourself. They really are not that complicated inside. I did
mine myself and if you really want to save yourself some trouble, don't
deal with PP at all, they're not too focused on customer service after they
have your money.
