&gt; 
&gt; Bill, first the oil leak is probably coming from your front(rear main)
flywheel
&gt; oil seal.There is no oil in the clutch housing.Is it gear oil(rather
smelly)?
&gt; or engine oil?If it is gear oil it might be coming from the front shaft
oil
&gt; seal inside the tranny that drives the clutch.

The oil appears to be light like motor oil, and I haven't smelled it yet but
haven't been blown away when I've had some on my fingers. I think you're
right about the front flywheel oil seal, though. I guess when that leaks it
gets spun around inside the clutch housing and maybe coles out the small
hole (and around the clutch housing where the engine and transmission join
which I assume does not have a gasket, right?). If so, this would explain
why I see the oil in the same spot, possibly leaking ffrom the point where
the clutch housing mates with the engine/trans and the cracks? 

&gt; In this case the clutch will not
&gt; last long as oil will get on the facings which may also eventually happen
with
&gt; the front main oil seal.

So far I haven't noticed any slippage. What's the symptoms? Does the oil
burn too (are there smells?)?

&gt; The bellhousing crack can be rewelded once you remove
&gt; the transmission and separate the bellhousing from the tranny....but are
you
&gt; sure it is cracked or is it casting flashing?In any event removal of the
&gt; gaersbox is in order.

Does unfortunately appear to be slightly cracked. Not big, really not
noticeable. But after the steam clean, I do see an oil trail near the crack.


Thanks Ed! I appreciate any and all input!!
