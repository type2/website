Subject: Re: Moving to Colorado

&gt;Hi, or howdy y'all-
&gt;
&gt;As some of you all know, I'm moving to Buena Vista (Colorado) in two weeks.
&gt;And as Joel pointed out to me, we have listmembers there. Also,
&gt;some people on this list may have lived in CO for awhile.
&gt;
&gt;I have not.
&gt;Nor have I driven there in the fall (read: snow).
&gt;
&gt;So I'd like thoughts, advice, suggestions, warnings -- you name it --
&gt;reagarding this move. And on the state. Vehicle inspections? Recommended
&gt;ski areas? Restaurants? Routes of travel from Seattle? High altitude bus
&gt;modifications? I dunno... Whatever!
&gt;
&gt;Just thought I'd tap the collective brain before journeying 1,500 miles
&gt;to a town of 2,500....   =)
&gt;

Well the first thing to do is find out how the natives pronounce Buena
Vista (the non-Spanish speaking natives, that is).

Snow? In Colorado? And you're from u.washington_dot_edu? I've lived 30 years in
the snowbelt and had my only slippery accident on I-5 just north of Seattle
(wasn't much: just did a U-turn using all three northbound lanes, 50 mph.
Didn't hit a thing other than the guardrail, which stopped me. I had
started in the fast lane). Didn't you get some practice during Dec 90 - Jan
91? Or did you do the reasonable thing and leave your vehicle(s) parked?

Anyway, Colorado's easy. The snow goes away. In Washington it just gets
slipperier.
