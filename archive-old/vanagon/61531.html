Subject: upper door track molding

First of all, a big thanks to everybody who helped me out with my previous
problems.  This list is the best use that my computer has been put to, and
in the spirit of the hippy movement (remember the hipppy movement) a
righteous and honorable undertaking.
My current problem knvolves the plastic moulding that covers the upper door
track on the inside of the body.  Last weekend I was in a parade in my
little berg, carrying 10 or 12 little beavers through town waving ond
throwing candy to all the spectaters.  Most of the time there was a fight
for position in the sunroof and during one of these fights the moulding
aforementioned was pulled off except for the last 6 or 7 inches.  I've tried
to slip it back into the channel by hand and with a dull screwdriver but so
far no luck.
Has anyone out there found an effective way of getting this thing back on?
