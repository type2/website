Subject: Waterboxer Exhost

I have been searching for an aftermarket exhost system for my 84 vanagon 
camper.  Does anyone know of a supplier?  Ideally, i would like to find a 
'performance' system.  Do i need to start manufacturing a system?  Would 
you buy one?.....Thanks, Stuart Crowell, Plymouth NH
