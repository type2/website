&gt; &gt; My dad just bought a '90 Vanagon camper, and later this month, he's
&gt; &gt; retiring to Washington State.  He doesn't read email, but sometimes I
&gt; &gt; post a question regarding his bus, so you might want to count it.
&gt; 
&gt; Well if you're gonna count that, you better count my mom's 94 Eurovan
&gt; Westfalia camper!  :)

Boy do I feel dumb.  My mom drives a late '70s Oldsmobile.  :(  I have
a friend with a Brown '85 or so Vanagon.  :)  Does that count?  Oh, 
once my dad owned a bug.  For the life of him he can't figure
out why he sold it.
