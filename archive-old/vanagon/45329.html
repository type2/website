Subject: Help: Need timing advice - type IV
Date: Wed, 26 Jun 1996 13:34:09 -0600

I'd like to know what folks on the list think about timing type IV's for
altitude (78 Westy and 82 Vanagon).  I live at 7500 feet, commute &quot;way
down&quot; to 6500 feet, often travel to over 10,000 feet on weekends.  Local
expert at work says don't dare vary from the book setting of 7.5BTDC at
idle.  Two local mechanics say set to 40/50 BTDC at full advance.  Sure
makes them run better with more advance up here.  *NO* power or
acceleration at 7.5BTDC!  I don't have temp gauges, but neither seem to
run overly hot when more advance is dialed in.
