Subject: Need Help Buying a Bus

        My name is Charlie Orchard, and I am interested in buying a late
sixties/early seventies Bus.  What should I look for or be wary about?
What should I pay particular attention to when I examine a Bus?  What
issues  do you
experienced Bus owners feel I should be informed about?

        I have about $2000 to spend tops, so any advice anyone has please
e-mail me directly:

corchard_at_chs.cusd.claremont_dot_edu

Thanks in advance.
