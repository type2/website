Subject: Re: Heater/Ventilation Questions

&gt;I have 2 questions,
&gt;
&gt;1.Regarding the rear heat system located under the bench seat in an '85 
&gt;Westy.  For the first time, we used this to get some outside air 
&gt;circulating in.  The fan or blower makes this loud clickity clackity 
&gt;noise.  How do you access the fan/blower to lubricate or correct this, or 
&gt;is this noise somewhat normal?
&gt;
&gt;2. There is virtually no air coming from the fresh air vents above the 
&gt;sliding passenger compartment door.  Plenty of fresh air comes in from 
&gt;the front vents, any ideas?  Thanks!
&gt;

The rear heater only recirculates, doesn't bring in fresh air. The rear fan 
motors in my 2 vanagons have been trouble free, unlike the fronts. The noise 
sounds like a pencil ot something sitting in the fan cage. Have a looksee. 
When the front motors start to seize they groan a lot. My panel van has a 
plastic box over the rear heater, comes off with screws, the other is 
exposed, but under the rear seat and behind a fibreboard cover.
        Prob # 2, You may have a loose piece of flexi-pipe in the dash or in 
the roof area by the door pillar . These join the air box bits to the 
distribution system. Remove the ashtray/glovebox and make sure all is in 
place. Is something blocking the tunnel in the passengers door?   tim s.
