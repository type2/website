Subject: Re: backfire!

&gt;could backfire result from air leaking past the intake gaskets?  

But wouldn't the engine stall frequently, not being able to idle correctly?
 A vacuum leak would make the engine stall all the time, and make it run
very poorly once you get it up to speed.

You said that the backfiring occurs only when downshifting.
