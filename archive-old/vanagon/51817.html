Subject: Re: mileage revisited

In response to the mileage observation:

I suspect in your area, as in the Philadelphia area where I'm at,
oxygenated fuel is used starting around Nov 1.  Oxygenated presumeably
causes less polution, but has less energy output.  In my '86 syncro my
mileage drops a good 2 mpg.  It's consistantly done this the last couple of
years.  I get 18-19 usually and get 16-17 with oxygenated fuels.

&gt;Hey all,
&gt;Yesterday I drove from Fredericksburg, VA to Laurel MD, which turned out
&gt;to be a round trip of 175 miles (I love trip odometers!) and I filled
&gt;the tank immediately before getting on the interstate, so it was all
&gt;highway driving.  Well, I filled up again when I got back and in that
&gt;175 miles I had used 11.065 gallons of gas, whihc comes out to 15.85
&gt;mpg!  That's awful!  I was driving with the speedometer between 60 and
&gt;65, depending on who was in front of me.  It's depressing to see the gas
&gt;gauge be that far down after a short trip like that.  Everything seems
&gt;to be running normally and all that.  Anyone got mileage like that on
&gt;the highway?  That's about 5 mpg less than my old '78 got on the
&gt;highway.
