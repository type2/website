Subaru 2 Volkswagen interested parties -

Mark did the conversion recently and posted lots of details
of how he did it.  He had access to machining equipment so did
the work himself and made parts as needed.  Posted messages in 
October last year to the type 2 list, as he was installing a 1600 into 
his '64 crewcab.

Other people who have expressed interest in the conversion:

EMiskow_at_aol_dot_com
smitht_at_unb_dot_ca
Tim Smith already has a 2.2L engine
wawho_at_hotmail_dot_com
TStone8359_at_aol_dot_com
magee2_at_flash_dot_net

I'm nowhere in a position to do this conversion, but am interested 
in what it'll take to do.  I have an '87 Subaru 4WD wagon that proved 
to me the reliability of the engine, 178K and still going strong.

I'm also a pack rat and kept copies of 3 of 4 of Mark's posts.
Don't have the resources to do a list or anything, just summarizing 
some stuff to hand off to others.

- Jeff
