Subject: Re: two questions

&gt;It has been suggested that I have the sidewalls 
&gt;filled with urethane insulation.
Could there be toxic fumes?


YES: don't use a spray foam, if it is a urea-formaldehyde type
it out-gasses during curing and for a long time after. In a closed camper 
this can lead to headaches and much more. Check your foam carefully before 
selecting!
Our CDN government subsidized UFFI (urea-f. foam insul.) for houses, then 
had to pay for gutting them years later due to med. problems.
 I've used a heavy fiberglass insulation, generic name 'Red Cap' to insulate 
my '85 panel van. Worrked very well, but too heavy for the roof panels, had 
to replace wiith reguular grrade fiberglass. It will be mucchh cheaper than 
foam, you'll need buckets of the stuuff. I also put down 1/2 in. sttyro foam 
sheeet on the ffloor, cooverd wwith 3/8 plywood. altogether a quiet and very 
warm vehicle. Anything is a big improvementt over 4 tin walls/roof/floor 
with no covering att alll however. Also he front and rear heaters are 
overkill when properly insulated, kept the fans low/off most of thee tiime..
