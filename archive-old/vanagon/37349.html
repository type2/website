If memory serves, once you get the bracket off you should be able to 
slide the new one right on.  I would use a socket over the end of the 
shaft to tap the bracket into place on the splines, rather than crank on 
the nut to snug it down.  You might want to put some Loctite on the 
threads to make sure that it doesn't back off again.
