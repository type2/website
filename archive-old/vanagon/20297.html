&gt;Message-ID: &lt;IjyelIi00WC_5ipTY9_at_andrew.cmu_dot_edu&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The 4 speed transaxle in my '83 DIESEL vanagon is done.
&gt;
&gt;Anybody have a source for used 5 speed transaxles to fit?
&gt;
&gt;Many thanks ,
&gt;
&gt;

My 4 speed transaxle is doing OK, but the diesel Vanagon REALLY needs a 5
speed, and I'd love to have one.  My understanding is a 5 speed was an
option; however, I have never seen one.

Mr. Armitage, if you find two, I'd appreciate it.
