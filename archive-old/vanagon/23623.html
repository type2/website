Subject: Help! (Engine rebuild info needed)

Hello All:

The Story
I am new to the list and definitely need some advice. I have an 81 Westy,
very nice condition with 75K miles. A month ago (only 30 miles driven since
then) I had a problem with low oil pressure. The technician never found a
problem but did replace oil filter and put in 20-50 weight oil, the oil
pressure seemed ok then. The engine had a knock/rap when started cold which
would go away in about 3-5 seconds. Now the knock/rap is there all the
time, its quite loud. My guess is that the engine is nearing the end of its
useful life.

The Questions:
I would like to rebuild it myself, I have plenty of time as I have two
other cars and really don't need the camper right now. (BTW the engine
burns no oil that I can tell so the top end may be ok, but I figure while I
have the engine out, I should do the whole thing) My questions relate to
getting a good resource for info on rebuilding this engine. Any
suggestions, I have no manuals at this time. I am also wondering if there
is any consensus on good sources for parts, and what should I look for. Are
there kits which will include everything I need to do a complete rebuild?
Any parts sources I should stay away from. Any hints on the process to help
the chances of a positive outcome? Things I should never disconnect or
disassemble. If this topic has been discussed to death, please excuse my
post and email any info directly to me.

Thank you very much for any advice.
Greg Shaw
