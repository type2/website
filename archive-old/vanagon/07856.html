Subject: RE: Gasoline/Exhaust Smell

	Thanks to everyone who responded to my original mail.  To clarify 
the &quot;gasoline or exhaust?&quot; question that William Kennedy asks, I think it 
is both a gasoline and an exhaust smell, hence 2 sources of my problem as 
Dave Kautz pointed out.  It seems odd that the cooling fan should draw air 
from inside the engine compartment where the air is warmer than &quot;fresher&quot; 
outside air--but there it is.  My carburator does get moist with gas on the 
outer part of the throttle shaft bearing and speaking of sources of smell 
in the engine compartment, there's plenty of thin oil film everywhere no 
matter how often I clean it, and I suppose that can't be helped. These 
residues and small leaks probably all contribute to the heat smell. Why wasn't 
the cooling fan air ducted directly from outside the engine compartment 
when VWs were designed?  It seems that the potential for even a minor leak 
on a new air cooled could screw up our health.  I'm glad Sami Dakhlia is 
out there sharing my concerns about this type of situation.  It must be 
quite prevalent since we air cooled types are mostly low budget people who 
probably don't have the means to fix the potentially numerous sources of 
engine air contamination.  I've been driving with vents and windows open to 
get better air circulation, but it's getting ever colder here in 
Connecticut.  What's a low-budget, health conscious bus owner to do?  While 
I'm on the health issue I'll mention another concern I have about those (I 
think they're asbestos) rings that mate the heat exchanger to the plastic 
heat channel tube.  This seems to have degraded on my 70 and 71 buses over 
the years and allowed particles to travel up the heat channel.  I bought 
the &quot;rubber&quot; types from VW for a whopping $9 each but I still think of all 
those old particles haunting my heat channel.  What are everyone's thoughts 
on this--Are our aircooled cars killing us a littler quicker than those 
watercooled people.
