Subject: Re: MPH and MPG

I have driven with a canoe on the roof, on and off for 25 years.  I
always found the mileage to be better with the canoe up there.  Almost
makes you want to glue it in place and leave it there.

&gt; We drove to Anchorage last year to buy a canoe, and treated the

&gt; 91).  On the
&gt; way home we got 24 mpg, the best ever, even with the boat on the
&gt; roof at
&gt; 60-65 mph.  That flies in the face of the octane vs. mpg thread from
&gt; a
&gt; while back (no relationship), unless the canoe actually lessened
&gt; aerodynamic drag...
