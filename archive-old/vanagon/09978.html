I had a similiar problem when i first purchased my 87' Syncro a few years ago.
First, i would check the throttle valve switch.  The location of the switches
varied slightly from year to year but all are located somewhere adjacent to the
throttle body.  If the switch is not adjusted properly, ie:  does not completly
close the circuit when at idle, the control unit is sent incorrect information.
This was exactly the problem with my van.  At idle it would surge back and
forth.  Adjusting the switch cured the problem.  The procedure for adjusting the
switch can be found in the Bently Manual and should be done with a continuity
tester if possible.  Good luck.

Mike
