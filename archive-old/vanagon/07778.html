There is one way to resolve this issue: do an informal poll of those on
the list and determine who has their thermostat/flap system still set up
and those who don't and compare against engine life....DC

As for myself - I hook the flaps up in the summer and engage them in the
winter but the thermostat is partially overextended so I can't say for
sure it works completely. At any rate the engine reaches operating
temperature either way (350 F), but around town in winter the engine is
more likley to dip down to 300 F. The heat coming from the vents is hot
either way. Does any one know the minimum
temperature the engine should operate at? It would seem to me the more
important factor is not engine temp, but oil temp, because that is what
causes premature engine where. Granted the two are correlated and perhaps
there is an argument here for not using synthetics since they absorb less
heat.

Also BTW I have a KG without any kind of flaps or thermostat, it has over
150,000miles on it...DC
