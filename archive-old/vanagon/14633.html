Hi Wouter, 

I want to get from South Africa a repair and parts microfiche for a 1990
rear-engined 4x4 Syncro Transporter/Caravelle (Kombi? to you). I want to do
this to compare the parts and configuration that are available for this
vehicle here in the USA. 

How would you suggest I go about doing this? Is there any way that you could
help me? I could do you a favor back by sending you a great deal of
technical literature and articles about the care and feeding of Type IV
motors, such as the 1700.
