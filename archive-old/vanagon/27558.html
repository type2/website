The 5 spd tranny for Diesel vanagons has the same final drive ratio as a gas
4 spd...
so you really don't gain anything... just an extra gear in the middle to
match the torque curve of the Diesel...

there is a shop here in NH that does quite a few Diesel to Gas conversions...
he likes to use the early GTI 1.8 liter engines... they develop 'round 90
hp.... without having head leaking problems...

he is able to reuse the same exhaust manifold/ exhaust system from the Diesel
as the block is the same...

just changes the intake stuff over to gas.... I think he uses a late ( after
'85) intake manifold to point in the correct direction (toward the rear) then
a round piece of PVC pipe across the rear so he can locate the Air flow
meter/filter housing on the right side of the engine compartment...

Jim DiGennaro of LiMBO fame had this done and it seems to work well...

Have also heard 'bout Esslinger Engineering down in Texas making adapter
plates for either an SHO FORD motor or a Nissan Maxima 6 cylinder to fit...
both supposedly fit under the engine cover with no problem...

waiting for VR6 EuroVans to come out is the US...
