Subject: Motors for sale

I have two 1.9 liter motors available. Since I upgraded my 1985 camper
to a 2.1 liter motor I no longer have a need for the 1.9's. One motor is
complete
with alternator and all exhaust pipes(no holes). This motor leaks externally
from
the drivers side head. I believe a few sub 10 degree days last winter may
have contributed
to the failure of the gasket. The motor was never overheated(in the 3 years
I had it).
It was removed in order to install the 2.1. I want $400 for this motor. For
an extra $100 
I'll throw in the muffler and cat. All that is missing form this motor is
the distributor.
The other motor is essentially a long block for exchange purposes. $150 for
that motor.
