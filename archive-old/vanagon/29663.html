&gt;however, i think the alternator or regulator is shot.  if you remove the
positive wire from the battery, engine dies right away. 
  =====================
Brandy:
Lifting the alternator lead to the battery when the engine is running is a
significant NO-NO !!!!!!!!  It can generate significant voltage spikes that
are capable of frying any electronics that happen to be &quot;on&quot; at the time,
including your engine's computer (if so equiped).  

Many shops will check your alternator and or regulator if you bring them in
(it is part of their sales pitch to verify that you really do have a bad
component, so they can sell you a replacement.)  In general, it is a good
thing to replace both the alternator and regulator at the same time if you
can.  Old mechanical regulators have contacts that pit and degrade, and some
alternators  (Bosch in particular) have internal regulators that also have the
slip ring brushes on them that often have worn and need replacement as well.
