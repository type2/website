Bill -

I've been rebuilding VW locks for the past 15 years.  One thing you don't
wanna use is WD-40.  After awhile it gums up the works.  I usually use
Electronic Tuner Cleaner (or the before-mentioned Brake Parts Cleaners), but
to lubricate, use a spray-on graphite solution.  In addition, to keep them
locks lubricated, especially after washing and drying off your pride &amp; joy is
to dip your key in some fine powdered graphite and insert the key in the
tumbler a few times, locking and unlocking it as well.
