Subject: RE: Replacing the seal on luggage rack

Having just replaced the same seals (surprizing effect - really makes the van 
seem new again) - I had no problem with the 4 rear bolts, as there was enough 
give in the insulation and/or headliner to make them spring back up as the 
rack came into alignment. They didn't all pop up at once, but with a little 
jiggling nothing else was required.

Right - the amount of trash and leaves under the rack was amazing. With the 
rack off I just cleaned and waxed to give a bit more surface protection. Maybe 
removing the rack every few years is a good idea just to clean underneath. 
Could have raised earthworms under mine. Sealed compartments always get stuff 
in better than it goes out. I think I'll leave the drain holes open just so 
air can get in to dry it out (eventually).

I know I've seen the tie-down fittings in a catalog, but I don't recall where. 
I've a couple broken too.

&gt;I have just installed the new rubber seal on the top and luggage rack of my
&gt;camper.  Does anyone know a trick to keep from pushing the four rear bolts
&gt;on the luggage rack back into the top when trying to align the luggage rack
&gt;while bolting it back on?  I just don't want to take out the headliner if
&gt;there is any other way to do it.  HELP!
&gt;
&gt;I couldn't believe all of the trash that was between the luggage rack and
&gt;the top of the camper!  It appears that anything that washes through the
&gt;four drain holes gets trapped between the luggage rack and top.  There is
&gt;no way out!  Has anyone else run into this problem?  I'm thinking about
&gt;putting tape over the holes or putting a screen in the holes.
&gt;
&gt;While I'm on the subject, does anyone know a source for the metal tie down
&gt;fittings on the top of the luggage rack?  Mine are quite rusted and I would
&gt;ke to replace them.

&gt;Thanks in advance (again).  Everyone has been so nice to help me get the
&gt;old camper back on the road again.  The next project will be the engine.
