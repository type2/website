So Matthew Burkel says:
&gt; 
&gt; I'm very new to this &quot; newsgroup? is this a newsgroup? &quot;,

Nope, a mailing list.  You get all of the mail sent to the
same mailing list by other subscribers posting messages to
it.  We exchange information via email.

&gt; this isn't my last stupid question, what is BTW ?

&quot;By the way&quot;

&gt; And now for the real question, I have a 71 camper that I luv,
&gt; it has some serious electrical problems, and I would like to locate
&gt; a copy of a schematic for the whole electrical sys.. Muir did a great
&gt; job but I need something not so general, and I'm on a student budget. :)

You might locate a copy of the Bentley manual in a used book store.
They have very good color coded diagrams.

Cheers!
