Subject: Re: Seeking advice on my first bus/van purchase

&gt;After a few years of being curious about owning a vw camper, I have decided
&gt;to take the plunge. Part of me can't wait to have one but I don't want to
&gt;make a bad choice. Please can you offer me your expertise?
&gt;
&gt;I have started researching how the vans have evolved but do not yet have a
&gt;clear sense of what would be best for me.
&gt;
&gt;My definite criteria are: under $4,000; manual transmission; and a pop
&gt;top/westfalia.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;From what I have read, I assume I should avoid a pre-1977.5 in order to not
&gt;deal with adjusting the valves. I also read that the after 1980 the
&gt;suspension/ handling improved due to the wishbone front suspension. And
&gt;finally, I have heard that after 1983, the first few years of the water
&gt;cooled engine were trouble prone. I am assuming that given my budget there
&gt;is no way that I can purchase a trouble free Wasserboxer (i.e., mid-late
&gt;80's on). So right now I am looking at 80-83's.
&gt;
&gt;Are my assumptions correct? What has been your experience? What do you wish
&gt;you had done that you didn't? Should I save up more money or can I get a
&gt;fun vehicle which I drive more than I repair?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance for your help.
&gt;See you on the road...
&gt;

Although the 80-83 years are fine vans..you might reconsider looking at a '71
bus. That was the last year they made the bus with the type 1 engine but
it's the improved version (doghouse cooler, dual port) and you can increase
the engine size (I'm going to put in a 1776cc). These engines are simple,
very easy to work on, cheap to rebuild &amp; easy to get parts for.  The '71
was the first year the bus came with DISK Brakes which is a vast improvement
over the drum years.  With four grand you could buy a '71 with a bad engine,
put in a new 1776 engine and give it a new paint job to boot...and you'd 
have a new looking &amp; running bus. The only down side is yes...you do have to 
adjust the valves...up side...you DON'T have to adjust dual carbs.
