Subject: Need advice for head gasket leak

Hi Volks,
  I noticed a series of post regarding head gasket leakage.   I wanted to
let everyone know that VW will pay for most of the repairs. (small
deductable) At least thats the info I get. I've been told that VW had filed
a paper with the Federal trade commission stating that they will pay for
most of the repairs in defects found to be common in most of there product
lines (rabbits engines sucking their oilpans dry was a big problem years
ago)  including Vanagon head gaskets.  This info is little known because no
one has made it public knowledge.  I have heard of a couple of people that
found this out and got VW to do the repairs.  Anyway, the best thing to do
is contact VWoA and ask them for help.  You may have to get stern with them
but with enough persistance VWoA will give in.  The closer to being the
original owner you are the better.  I would call VWoA anyway, its better
than paying for the repairs yourself.  Good luck to all.  Take care.

                        Keep on Busin' -Jim
