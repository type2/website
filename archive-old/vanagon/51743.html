Subject: Re: He's After The Unknowns AGAIN!!! :)

OK OK...I'm brand new here though...and the proud owner of a 1978 poptop bus,
and a very recently acquired 93 Eurovan MV (in need of a good parts source -
needs all four brakes and rear wheel cylinders in a HURRY).  I also have a 79
bus sitting in my woods doing time as a garage, which I fantasize about
building someday.  In between our buses - we lost one to the fire gods - fuel
line leaked onto the engine and gave the Lambertville NJ fire company quite a
gleeful night - a 78 automatic poptop.  We were leery about the automatic
anyway - had just put in a rebuilt engine and POOF!  But we left NJ with our
wonderful 78 standard poptop, found storing bricks behind a gas station in
Trenton, not even for sale, and we convinced the guy to let us take it off
his hands to the tune of $600.  Made it to VT no problem : ).  Too many
winters with no heat - we moved on up to our Eurovan and have the poptop
pulled off the drive to sit out winter.  That's my story.  Glad to find ya'll
out here.
