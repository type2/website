Subject: '74 Hubcap situation solved!
Date: Sat, 29 Jun 1996 11:40:37 -0500

to the list,

First, I would like to thank everyone who responded to my stupid question
about '74 hubcaps.  It is finally solved!  My new hubcaps came in on
Friday and the method I used to put them on was the &quot;thump it with the
side of your fist on the edge&quot; method.  

I also discovered (while doing this) the source of my problem to begin
with.  CHEAP A*S HUBCAPS!  The new ones I put on were from RMMW.  Good
quality, and &quot;thumped on&quot; with just one &quot;thump&quot; and snugged up to the
wheel very well.  I then tried it with one of my older (Brazilian)
hubcaps. No matter how hard I &quot;thumped&quot; on it, it would not snug up to the
wheel like the new ones.  Everyone of my new caps went on with one &quot;thump&quot;
and I feel confident that is where they will stay until I remove it.
  
BTW...the new caps are from Mexico, which made me wonder at first...but
they are very good.  

Once again...thanks to everyone who sent suggestions.
