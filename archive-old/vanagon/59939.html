Dear Lee Tucker,

You must be close, since you are on iglou.

A place we love to go and that is within 3 hrs of Louisville is the Big 
South Fork National Recreation Area.  Specifically Bandy Creek Campground 
just 10 or so miles from Oneida Tn. off US 27 just over the KY border.

This is a seldom used / new facility.  I don't know if you can make 
reservations.
Call for Oneida information 615 or 423 area codes.

Also the campground is on  the plateau.  There are great mountain bike 
trails nearby.
Plenty of road biking as well.

The gorge overlooks are great. If the river is running you can probably 
raft.  
This place was setup to be an overflow for the smokeys.  
Its great we go there 10-15 x per year.  There are showers as well.

Have Fun,

Sam Moore


&gt;Hello all,
&gt;We are kind of late in deciding this, so we need some help. Where can we 
&gt;go on Mem. Wknd to camp in the WV, Virginia, Tn, NC, KY area (mountain 
&gt;regions)? I know there are listmembers who have camped in the area and 
&gt;might be able to give 1st hand recommendations. We want someplace we can 
&gt;hike or bike (road bikes), but not on the Bl Ridge (we are doing that 
&gt;later this summer).  We wanted to go to the smokies, but hear that it is 
&gt;a zoo on holiday wknds. is this true?  We don't need hook ups (though it 
&gt;would be nice if it's chilly), but we do like hot showers (don't have our 
&gt;sunshowers yet).  We also would feel better if we could make 
&gt;reservations, we don't want to drive 6 hrs to a 1st come place, cause 
&gt;there probably won't be anything left.  
&gt;Thanks
&gt;Lee and Gretchen
&gt;
