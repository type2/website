Subject: Re: Blowing Coolant Hoses Right and Left (VW Service)

I have recently seen an encouraging trend in VW service. My local dealer, Bob 
Lewis VW in San Jose, used to be really lousy IMHO. Over about the last 1-2 
years after buying a new '94 Golf I have had the following experience:

-Car is always ready on time
-Most parts are in stock
-They call me when the car is ready
-They call me after the service to make sure everythings still ok
-They have a &quot;preferred service program&quot; that gives you 10% off parts and labor,
a free engine steam clean, and a free oil/filter change on your birthday.
-Last time, when I brought the car in for my 15k (warranty) service, they even 
washed the thing when I told them I never have time to.

Don't get me wrong, these guys still aren't perfect, and I have had to bring the
car back 2 or 3 times to fix misc rattles, etc (I'm picky, but shouldn't you be 
with a new car?). In fact, these problems are more VWoA's than the dealers.

Their salesmen, as with just about any other dealer I have encountered, are a 
bunch of scum-sucking leaches for the most part. Fortunately, those are not the 
people you have to deal with very often.

BTW, Sergio, I think you need to chill out a bit. You're not going to make a lot
of friends with statements like &quot;VWoA is building pieces of shit these days&quot;. 
I'm sure Ric will have a few politically-incorrect comments about that one ;). 
(or are we only PC now after the african-american incident?) I don't want this 
to turn into a pissing contest over bugs vs. golfs or whatever. I _will_ argue 
that the Golf /// is better than the Golf A2, which is in turn better than the 
rabbit in almost every respect.

I have 4 VW that span from '65 to '94 and love them all.
Enough!

&gt; &gt; Yep too! VW-service sucks and VWoA is building pieces of shit these days, 
&gt; &gt; the newer they get, the shitter they are! What happened to the good old 
&gt; VW's (like those 2,000,000 miles bugs ?). I'll never buy
&gt; &gt; a VW again... at least not new.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Well... I agree that VW engineering is lacking, I don't fully agree that it's
&gt; a complete piece-o-shit.  I happen to like my van alot.  From reading your
&gt; postings about your van experiences, I think the problems you had are much
&gt; more the fault of bad service and unwillingness on the part of the dealers/
&gt; garages to fix the real problems.  And when they don't do the work correctly,
&gt; it compounds the problems.  My complaint is primarily against VW's service
&gt; department (what an oxymoron) which refuses to really try to fix the problems
&gt; and instead side-steps them hoping you'll go away or put up with it.
