Subject: VW Classic Weekend and how my truck did

I won, I won, I won.   read on.

well, just got back from the VW Classic.  also went to the SOTO meat
yesterday and the Berg Rally on friday.  Meet up with Rusty Vanbondo on
both day's and got to talk and
look at picts of his imfamous &quot;Resto From Hell&quot;  i must say that it has
com along way and from what i say, is on i's way to being one heck of a
bus.  It looks like it will look fabulous.  Good job Rusty.  Also hooked
up with Tim from long beach and  meet his family.  Hope you get back on
the list tim.

The Berg rally was fun although we got there late.  it was dark, and well,
we got totally lost.  needless to say, we did not finish it.  (Anybody
know where the &quot;Casteroil&quot; sign was?  the first clue)  It is real bad to
use a 6v car to do a rally at night.  i would not recomend it.  it was fun
though driving around Orange like a lost tourest.  There were quite a few
others doing it with us also.

The SOTO meet was good.  not as many bus's as in the past, but it
was fun.  There were quite a few folks with parts for sale, myself
including.  I know that i did good, and i think that most others did too.
It seamed like parts were selling.  Charlie Hamill had his low milage 1960
westy out as well as a never seen befor, all original 1961 single cab.  It
has 20,000 original miles and is the same light grey color as my truck.
even smelled new.  The rest of the SOTO was as usual.  Alot of nice and
not so nice bus's there.

Didn't go to the toy show, so cant report.

The classic.  What a show.  i got there at 7:15 and the line was all the
way out to the freeway.  That is about 1 mile, t cars wide.  The entire
parking lot was full by show time.  oh, i would say 1000+ VW's.  real cool
to see.  there were about 40 bus's in the vintage half and a few less in
the custom half.  Good turn out.  some real nice ones too.  best in class
for earli campers was Blue Nelsons optioned out doormobile.  he took this
one to the northers canada last year and flipped it on it's side.  Real
need picture of it too.  it looks perfect now.  Best for earlie passenger
was a 65 deluxe micro.  It was BEUTIFULL.  it had been apraised at $27,000
and looked it.  the paint was flawless.  T

The winner of the earlie
comertial class was, well me.  my crew cab won first in vintage comertial
class.  i was exceted about it.  I had alot of folks looking at it and
asking all kinds of Q's.  i had it for sale, but got nothing definate.  I
did get a few good leads though.  We will see what happens.  I also spoke
with Hot VW's and we are going to shoot a full spread article for the
truck this weekend.  That really made my day and also made all the work
worth it.  Now to find a good place to shoot it.  any ideas.

Other notable vehicles there was a 59 beetle with 4,500 original miles.
What a nice bug.  totally original and unused.  There was a &quot;freedo&quot;  (SP)
bus there too.  that is one of the old original german postal vehicles.
cool looking.  Quite a few &quot;bindz&quot; crew cab's, 2 ladder trucks, 2 fire
trucks, a ambulance, a 51 panal van (real nice totally restored), 46, 49,
50 bettles.  also a few old keblewagons, a BD deluxe micro, a cool double
door standard deluxe, a few romesh's and alot of other real nice car's.
you name it, and it was there.  Alot af parts for sale too.  i did not buy
anything though as right now i have no projects to work on.  i guess i
will have to fix that.

anyway, it was a fun weekend, one definatly coming out for next year.
Furthest driven car was from Quebec, and i spoke with folks from England,
Australia, Japan, Germany, New Zeland and Denmark.  It is woth the trip.
plan now for next year.
   

Take care and God Bless
