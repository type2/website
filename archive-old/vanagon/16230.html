&quot;As I understand it, VW will pay about 85--90% of the cost of repairing 
your 83.

It *does not matter* whether you are the original owner or not.

It *does not matter* how old in years your car is.&quot;

	I say: IF YOU'RE LUCKY! (sorry about the shouting...)
I think this thread only concerns leaking gaskets, but I gotta vent...

	My wife and I bought an '88 Vanagon used, with 104,000 miles 
on it. We soon learned, perhaps, why it had been such a good deal- 
both *heads* were cracked. The gaskets may or may not have been 
leaking also, but sure as hell, both heads were cracked and leaking.

	According to the service manager at my dealer, VW would do 
*NOTHING* for me- no reduction in parts or labor at all. 

	$2000 later, I had two new cylinder heads. I started the 
Better Business Bureau arbitration process, and *many* months later VW 
offered me 10% of the cost of the heads, no allowance for labor. I 
took it, figuring I had been reamed and not having expected anything.

	In retrospect, maybe I should have spent a little more money 
and bought a whole new engine, but I didn't have anywhere to work on 
my Van at the time anyway.

	Volkswagen is DAMN LUCKY that I consider the weakness of the 
Wasserboxer to be a fluke. Aaaarrrggghhh! Why couldn't they have put a 
2.0L Golf engine in the Vanagon and done it RIGHT???

	Happy Motoring (grumble, grumble, grumble...)
