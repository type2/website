&gt; 
&gt; I have often thought of combining two busses (the front and rear 2/3 of
&gt; each) to make a stretch bus.  There is some talk here lately of one of these
&gt; having been sighted in Palo Alto, or something.  It seems that it would be
&gt; rather straightforward sheet metal work.  Has anyone else done this?
&gt; 
&gt; I did see in Los Alamos a '63+'64 stretched by one window panel, and a tall
&gt; roof out the top.  This guy is a hermit electrical engineer for the Lab
&gt; there, and has the whole thing instrumented to the hilt, with propane
&gt; heater, stove, tanks, and even a shower inside.  Pretty neat.  
&gt; 
&gt; Another dream I have is to plant a bug top on the roof of my Westfalia, so
&gt; that you'd have the windsheild like those old Greyhound busses, and more
&gt; glass all around.  I just can't give up the upper bunk, though.
