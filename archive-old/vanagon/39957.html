Ric sez:

&gt; ...you know how much fun it is to late brake into
&gt;an exit ramp with an ABS EV, leaving mere mortals 
&gt;sliding off into the weeds!!

Yes, I do!... About every third or fourth morning I
get to test the system as I try to make a stale green
onto the local expressway to work; it's an odd
feeling, initiating a turn with a pulsating brake
pedal while going over ripples in the pavement.

My fav is setting up a tailgater for a cloverleaf;
moderate speed going in, NO braking going into
the turn, gas through the turn, and if he/she/it
is still in the mirrors then I know he wasn't a 
Fred and I let him by

Geez, maybe it's time to hit Hwy 49 after Picnic Day
this weekend...
