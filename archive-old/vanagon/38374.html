   &gt; If your fridge is similar to mine ('82 westy) the resistance
   &gt; should be just below 2 Ohms (1.9).

   Thanks, Martin.
   I measured 2.5 Ohms, but may need to check again with a more accurate 
   meter before I attribute the problem to the heating element.
   Thanks again,

   Sami

2.5 ohms seem just fine to me. The 12v heating element (and the 110V
one as well I believe) are rated at 75W. Assuming battery voltage
of 13.4V your 2.5 Ohms gives 72W, an insignificant difference. 

A somewhat more foolproof test is to measure the current to the
fridge while running. It should be somewhere near:

	75/13.4 = 5.6 A

What are your symptoms? Fridge just not getting cold on 12V or
have you narrowed down the possible problems? Note that it takes
a long time of continuous running to start getting it cold (&gt; .5h), so the
12V heating works best only for very long trips. Have you seen
the fridge files in the archives?
