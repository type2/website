Subject: Re: Vanagon Sliding Door Problem

In a message dated 95-11-17 22:01:51 EST, you write:

&gt;&gt;I have noticed a problem with the sliding door on my '87 Vanagon Camper. It
&gt;&gt;opens while I am driving sometimes (even when locked) and is hard to shut

My '87 used to do this a lot, especially during the winter. Used to think the
latch or something had been damaged from people slamming the door closed hard
like you have to do with full-size US vans. Finally, I discovered last winter
that the latch, which is at the back of the door, was gunked up a little and
not free enough to catch properly. Some wd-40 freed it up and it quit popping
open. It started popping open a few weeks ago and the lube job fixed it
again.

The popping open sure does get the attention of those riding in the back two
seats, doesn't it? Try checking and lubing the latch...hope it works.
