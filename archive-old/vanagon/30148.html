Subject: Engine transplants


Regarding the engine transplant thread.

When this list was still in its infancy, which was probably during its
first 6 months, there was an observation from someone who had travelled
in South America. (I think it was someone named Bill, not sure though).

While in South America, this person came across a number of Vanagons
that had Toyota engines transplanted into them. I think these were 
Corolla engines.

I don't know if this transplant required any rear deck lid mods.

Granted, these are not German engines, but they did work. Perhaps 
the &quot;obsession&quot; with keeping the Vanagon all German should be foregone
for an option that works.

I know that at some point I am going to replace the engine in
my Syncro. That point will be sometime within the next 5 years. As
much as I lust after the 911 setup, I'll probably end up with a more
practical water cooled solution. 

I am certainly benefitting from all the transplant discussion
and look forward to hearing all transplant stories, whether 
successful or not.
