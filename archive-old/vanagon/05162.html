Subject:      if you liked Unimog, you'll LOVE this ...

from November 1994 issue of Four Wheeler:

Add luxury comfort to a Mercedes Unimog and you get a Funmog.

The smaller U90 Funmog is equipped with a 110hp, 2.8-liter diesel engine, and
the larger U1400 is powered by a 155hp, 6.0-liter diesel, both with standard
12-speed gearboxes (24 speeds optional); ABS and 20-inch wheels are standard,
as are front and rear locking differentials and fording depth of four feet.

What makes a Funmog different from a Unimog is the interior:
tinted windows, wall-to-wall carpeting, fabric upholstery (the same as
Mercedes' cars), air-suspension driver's seat, air conditioning, power
steering and a stereo.  Target price is (take a deep breath) $100,000 at
the July exchange rate.

Contact:    Mercedes-Benz AG
            Unimog Div.
            D 76567 Gaggenau
            Germany
to order yours.
