Subject: Re: Spring Jamboree and how my bus stacked up

well, when it cam to the end of the day and prizes were given out, i was
unsure.  i knew i had the nicest vintage bus out there but did not know if
the judges put everybody in the correct class.  i was in the Vintage
Comertial class.  well to sum it all up...

  I WON FIRST PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!       Yippie.

i was extaticwhen i went up to get my trophy.   big sucker.  anyway, that
kind of made the last 11 months of resto work worth it.  it made me feal
good that the hard work was apreciated.  i had a blast the whole day
talking to people and sharing my experiance about the bus.
