Subject: `66 westy?

Well, I went to look at a `56 oval today....needed a *LOT* of work,

said `no, thanks! are you selling the camper?' He is, for 200$, no
rust, (YAY!) Only one thing is bothering me, (I know, it's minor, but
I tend to get touchy about things like this.) The camper top looks
something like this:

			|pop-top ventilator|

etc.

My question: Did Westfalia ever put such a top on their campers of this
era? BTW, it has pinto (ACCKK!) tailights, so this isn't stock, but VW
has been known to do strange things. All the camper stuff inside _is_
westy. Looks pretty good. No engine. but I have one that might fit.:)

Another BTW, I'll soon be parting out my `63. (Lost cause. Too much
rust to deal with. It definutely was a &quot;D&quot; response on the questionare,
the one that said: `This looks like a CHALLENGE!' E-mail me if you want
something. It's in Olympia, WA. Rustng away.... :,(
