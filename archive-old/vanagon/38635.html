Subject: Early Delivery Van Article

In the April edition of VolksWorld is a nice article on pre-60s VW delivery 
vans. About 10 pictures of various vans and pick-ups in &quot;commercial livery&quot;. 
The article is 4 pages long. If anyone wants a copy, send me a 
stamped-self-addressed envelope. Here's the address:

Ric Golen
