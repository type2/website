I asked at the dealer when I took my 91 Vanagon for service and was told
to use the regular Bosch plugs.  They did not recommend the Platinums.

&gt;        Reply to:   RE&gt;&gt;re. Bosch Platinums
&gt;re my original Bosch Platinum experiences and all the responses I've got.
&gt;
&gt;ummmm.  Now you all have me thinking.  I've gotten several messages on how
&gt;well the BOSCH platinums have worked for other people.  
&gt;
&gt;  My #005# motor is a stock '90 2.1 liter from my '90 Carat (rolled,
&gt;Thanksgiving,
&gt;1995 - oops) and ran well then.  I did put Bosch platinums in it before the
&gt;roll over and don't remember what the life was.  Will have to check my
&gt;records.  I pulled the motor and dropped it into the current '89 Syncro.
&gt;With
&gt;two sets of the BOSCH Platinums now, I have had less than 15 K miles and 6
&gt;months to a year life.  
&gt;
&gt;The only current problem is a consistent idle at 2000 rpm when weather is
&gt;cold.  (It get's that way here in Minnesota.)  However, this spring I noticed
&gt;that the high idle stayed once it warmed up.  No hunting or surging that I
&gt;recal, as noted in current threads I recall, just high idle around 2000 rpm.
&gt;
&gt;Maybe once I get the front suspension rebuilt in the next week I better check
&gt;the motor.  Could be the high idle has progressed to something else that
&gt;trashes the Platinums?
&gt;
&gt;oh, by the way, the wear pattern on the BOSCH platinums was the center
&gt;electrode wears down well below the level of the ceramic.

&gt;&lt;&lt; I tried them in my 90 Carat, and again in my '89 Syncro.  (Same motor due
&gt;to a minor mishap in 95, i.e., we rolled it.)
&gt; 
&gt; The Platinum's corroded and wore so badly that after 6 months they were
&gt; useless.  I'm really not sure why.  Both local Dealer (West Side VW) parts
&gt; guys, and several other reputable contacts I know said stick with the stock
&gt;plug.  I'm now on stock plugs, and will see how they wear after a month or
&gt;two.  &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Wow!!!  I'm shocked at the short life of your platinums.  Our 88 is on it's
&gt;third set now at over 120,000 miles.  I just put them in a few months ago
&gt;making over 50,000 miles for each of the first two sets.  Similar performance
&gt;in my 87.
