&gt;I had this problem and it drove me crazy trying to get at the clutch pedal 
&gt;mechanism to lubricate it. I ended up doing it by feel. I sort of memorized 
&gt;the locations of everything and put a glob of grease on my finger and 
&gt;reached up from the bottom and deposited the grease in the proper place. 
&gt;It's been quiet for 6 months now. I just hope I never have to change the 
&gt;clutch master cylinder.

Cluct master is actually easy to change.  It all gets done from underneath
and nothing else has to be removed.  Use paint tray to catch all drippngs as
they stain carpet bad and stink the van up.
