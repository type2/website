Subject: Re: 87 GL Power Brake Problem

The brake pedal on my 87 GL has started &quot;going to the floor&quot;

--  I was wondering if you step on the pedal fast and hard does it hold 
firm?

    Then if you apply even pressure slowly does the pedal fall to the 
floor?

    If the later of the two is the case your master cylinder is probably 
the failing part.  In the last 5 years I don't think our shop has ever 
replaced a servo in a Vanagon.  But many masters!
