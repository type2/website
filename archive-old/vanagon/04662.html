Subject: Re:  About that sunroof....
Date: Wed, 28 Sep 94 09:32:54 EDT

&gt; Hi all....
&gt; 
&gt; I am still looking for a drop in replacement for my large sunroof
&gt; for my 72...You know...one of those plastic pop-up goodys.
&gt; 
&gt; Any hints?
&gt; 
I had this problem with my '78 a few years ago. Idid 2 things- first,
temporarily, Iclamped the old one in place and gooed it up with
silicone. This worked until later, when I installed a pop-top off
a dead camper. It took about a day to completely put the top on, and
didn't require that much drilling. If you feel adventurous and want a
camper anyway, I would suggest finding a complete top assembly at a
junkyard and putting that on.
