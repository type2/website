Geez Ari Dimwitted Do it Yourselfer that I am, the thought of filling the
filter before hand -- never occured to me ;). Actually Ari explain to me
the difference between &quot; worrying about high oil pressure and worrying
about moving part
lubrication&quot;. What other concievable indicators do we have that everything
is being properly lubricated? The issue here (as someone pointed out) is
the difference at the margins, especially the low end. VW specifies a
specific minimum oil pressure that is required
for its Vanagons (29 psi at 2000 rpm at 80C). This pressure is the
minimum necessary
and is the holy grail that I (and perhaps others) seek. An oil light that
regularly comes on at idle is a cause for concern as is low oil pressure
at speed, whether synthetic is used or not. If a change in filters can
eliminate these problems, then it is reasonable to assume that oil
pressure throughout the system has increased.

There is no one on this list whose intention it is to obtain an
artificially high oil pressure for its own sake - it is merely an
indicator (with 80 psi being the max desirable before oil seals fall
into that jeopardy category).   DC
