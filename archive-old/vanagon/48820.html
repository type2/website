Subject: Replacing Rear Westie Speakers (oh boy...)

Hi Gang,

Well, I am at a complete loss regarding how to replace the _at_#$%!! rear 
speakers in my 87 Westie. Getting to the door mounted speakers weas 
easy (once I found the secret screw!), but oh, man do I not have a 
clueas to how to get the speakers out of the AC bulkhead. This 
probably would not be so hard if I didn't have AC, but I do and it 
looks like I'm going to have to do some major work! Anybody done this 
before? ANy suggestions?

Thanks,

Steve
