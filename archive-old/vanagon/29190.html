Subject: '79 Bus Test Run--I mean walk

        Ok, all.  I fired up the 79 today and went for a little drive.  I
have 3 caps and 3 rotors but don't know if any of them are for my bus so
through the process of elimination I came up with the best combo.  I use the
term &quot;best&quot; loosely.  I think I hit 40 once.  Oh, well, I have a distributor
rebuild kit coming Monday.
        Anyway, after driving about 4 miles I stopped the bus and noticed a
strange smell.._dot_coming from my driver's side wheel.  I touched the hupcap
and !OUCH! it's hot!  I popped the hubcap off and !!OWSHIFUK!! the axle nut
is WAY WAY hot.  BTW, this bus hasn't been driven more than a few feet in 5
years or so.  Ok, I figured either my brake caliper is dragging or my
bearings are shot.  Any ideas?  My brakes seem to be fine.  No grabbing and
no pulling from either side.  They're a little spongy but I'd be too if I
hadn't moved in 5 years.  I don't hear any grinding noises coming from the
wheel area when driving, either.  Any input from experts would be appreciated.

TIA,
bob.
