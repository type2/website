Subject: FS: '81 Diesel Westy, Duncan BC

A posting in the local paper today (Duncan, BC, Canada):
Contact them, not me. (Although I could do a drive by if someone is 
interested.)

'81 Diesel Westfalia, fridge, stove, sink, good canvas, clean inside 
&amp; out, $3995, priced for quick sale.


This *sounds* like a great deal if the body is solid... If we didn't 
have a baby on the way, I'd consider it myself.
