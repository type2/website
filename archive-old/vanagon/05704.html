Ric (the Joel Walker of the EV world) said:

&gt;I think part of the problem with the fogs is that they are expensive
&gt;little suckers....at least the ones that are supposed to go into
&gt;the bumper. The VW dealer in Wolfsburg wanted $270 for the pair!
&gt;Hopefully over the next couple of weeks I can find a set that will
&gt;fit into the bumper area.

HA!  you got that right, Ric!  I went searching for those Hella DE's
that fit 91.5 - 92 GLIs and GTIs and it's $300+ for the complete kit,
whereupon I gave up my search since it's been a while since I've had
to crawl through tule fog.  

I figured the same thing held true for the EV, except worse, since
there are way fewer EVs on the road than Golfs and Jettas.
I had contemplated getting the PIAA 90 PROs because I'd heard good
things about them, and because they offered both fog and driving
lamps incorporated into the housing.  Dimensionally, they also seem
close to the cutout on the bumper/airdam.  But, alas, the desire
didn't match the $$, so it's yet another project on the backburner.

Ric, have you compared the cutout dimensions with that of the Corrado's?
Just by eyeballing, I'd say they looked kind of close, and the curved
housing would match the cutout (at least better than the PIAA's rect-
angular housings).  Plus, the Corrado's fog lamps are the Hella DE's.

Let me know if you find a combo that works.

Norman
