Paul sez:
&gt;Why stop at '78? I can tell you - having owned a '78 Westfalia - that you
&gt;really want a '79, at least as far as the camp gear goes. The big
&gt;difference is that the '78 fridge is this hairbrained scheme that opens
&gt;from the top like an ice chest, so you have to pull everything out to get
&gt;to anything. '79 Westfalias have a more sensible front opening fridge. I do
&gt;not know if it's the same Dometic propane/electric model that is found in
&gt;later model Westys, but it may be.
&gt;
The fridge in my '75 Westfalia Deluxe opens from the front, like your '79.
Other equipment includes, well, the usual:
pop-top, 2 double beds, 1 hamac to be hung over the front seats, fridge
(electric) and double gas stove above, closet in the back where they
usually put the spare tire, trunk under the rear bench, water container
and sink with electric pump, jump seat usually strapped between the front
seats (it's also a box which we use for maps, tapes, CDs, etc.), a small bench
squeezed between the sink and the rear bench, a removable table, a board
that fits between the sink and the stove top to create a large cooking
surface, another small table with to be attached to the dash between the 2
front seats, electric hookup, city water hook-up, did I forget anything?
(Elfking, you've got the same, don't you?)
