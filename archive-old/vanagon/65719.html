          &gt;uh, we're still on a vw list, right?

          &gt;i shouldn't even have responded to the post(s), but c'mon
          &gt;already...

     Consider it an automotive accessory, at least here in NM where the law
     allows carrying a concealed loaded weapon in one's own vehicle (as
     well as on one's own property - without meaning to offend Ron L.,
     consider it my truthful contribution to his web-based survey &quot;What do
     you keep in your bus?&quot;).

          &gt;(usual anti-gun sentiments here)

     (usual constitutional-rights retorts here)

     There.  Now no one should feel a need to continue this thread any
     further - &quot;supersets&quot; of all arguments pro and con are deemed to be
     included in the above two parenthetical statements.

     End of discussion - moving back to the mainstream.

     -Blaine
     (Please, everyone take all the above in the non-confrontational,
     tongue-in-cheek, grain-o'-salt, defuse-the-situation vein in which it
     is intended - and if you absolutely can't let it pass, &lt;&lt;expletive
     deleted&gt;&gt;, I don't want to hear about it.)
