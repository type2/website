Subject: overheating 82

	I realize that overheating of VW's is probably I well worn 
subject but I am getting a little nervous about driving mine.  It is an 
'82 Westi in which I just rebuilt the engine after 30k miles of 
traveling.  The previous owner had just installed a &quot;new&quot; engine which 
seemed to me to be running cool enough.  I checked the temp by touching 
the dip stick (usually too hot to hold) and by holding my hand over the 
defroster with the hot air on (also very hot).  Both of these are 
subjective.  
	The question I have is this;  How hot is too hot and when (soon) 
I instal a temp guage should it be an oil temp or head temp (such as #3)?
BTW, the last rebuild was necetated because the L head loosened up--the 
manual says this should'nt happen.  Well I know better now, I guess!?
BTW  I'm new to this internet thing, so thanks in advance and &quot;see&quot; you 
later.
	Walt.
