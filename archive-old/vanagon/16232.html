Subject: RE: Help on Brake Drum.

Note other postings re: dangers if the shoes are not fully retracted.
St. Muir suggests that instead of a puller you use a chain from one
lugnut, through something heavy (I used a spare wheel/tire) to another
lugnut.  Swing the heavy object repeatedly to the limit of the chain's
loop.  The inertia of the heavy object, and the fact that it is delivered
in bursts, work very well if the problem is the drum rusted onto the axle
splines.
