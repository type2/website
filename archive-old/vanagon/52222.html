That is rich, trying to get a catalog from the Busboys. I've been trying to
get a catalog from them for over eight months. Last I heard, Jim was going to
send me samples of seat cover material, that was last June. It is too bad,
they seem afraid to hire additional help to handle the amount of orders and
questions that they supposedly get. I am not interested in doing business
with a company with this lack of support.
Definitely go with Volkscafe, they are much more customer oriented.
