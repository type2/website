Subject: Low oil Pressure?

Today somthing happened that has not happened before.  My oil pressure light and
buzzer has begun coming on above 2000 rpm.  My van has only 60,000 miles and
starts and idles fine and there doesn't appear to be any overheating problems.
The oil on the dip stick is right where it should be.  The oil pressure warning
light goes out instantly after starting and does not come on until the engine
rpm increases above 2000 rpm.  Could it be a problem with either of the oil
pressure switches, stuck oil pressure relief valve, a worn oil pump, or even
worse, severe internal engine damage?  I can hear no strange noise .  I have
changed the oil every 3000 miles without a miss.  Has anyone experienced a
problem similiar to this?  The car sits idle.
