Subject: Looking for parts for a '67 Westfalia.

The following message is a courtesy copy of an article
that has been posted as well.

I am looking for the following parts for my '67 Westfalia [you
remember Ras Bulli Split]:

     1) windshield washer bottle and pump
     2) oil-aircleaner for 1500S, plus hoses
     3) front and rear overriders
     4) LHS rear axle sleeve with 1-tonne suspension damper mount
	[the mount for that little chunk of rubber that sits on the
	axle sleeve and prevents the suspension from bottoming out on
	the frame]. 

The best way to reach I is via E-mail [Roy.Nicholl_at_ASG.unb_dot_ca], but I
can also be reached at (506) 457-0536 after 18h00 ADT/AST...

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Bricks...Oh, my!

Roy
