So Eric Oster says:
&gt;    Well, hell. Mabey Volkswagens are a religion, and for your perusal:
&gt; 1st commandment: Thou shalt change thine oil every 2500 miles,
&gt; or suffer the fate of the burned valves 

I think you want to include adjusting the valves, if you really want
them to last.  
&gt; 
&gt; 2nd commandment: Thou shalt stop for all Volkswagens in need, and
&gt; in return thou shalt receive the same treatment; for today's helpee
&gt; may become tomorrow's succor... :^)

I think you need some kind of commandment for rust.  That's the real
enemy!
