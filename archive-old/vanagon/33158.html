Hello fellow list members,

In case anyone wants to look at another VW, my web page has been updated =
to include a new picture page of my '74 deluxe Westy.  Her name is =
Gretchen.

The address, as though you could get away from your mail program enough =
to crank up the old web browser is:

http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~mewhite/home.html

BTW, at the risk of starting another mail slot filling thread on this =
list, is it just me, or do other VW owners have an instinctive urge to =
name their VW's, when they have never named any other vehicle of any =
other manufacturing?  I've owned Chevy's and Toyota's, but never grew so =
fond of them to give them a name.

Mark White
'74 Westy (aka...Gretchen)
