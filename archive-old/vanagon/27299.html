Subject: Holly carb and stuff.

ok, now that i actually have time on my hands for a while i will actually
start posting to the list...  so here it is.
i picked up a holly carb and manifold at the swap meet in puyallup (sp?)
washington on the 15th, i even actually installed it before it all started
to rust:)  it's a single port manifold with a holly 2100 two barrel carb
sitting on it, the performance gain was pretty good, i.e. steep hill in
third instead of second.   does anyone know how to adjust these monsters?
theres two adjustments that i assume are fuel and air mixture settings but
on the other hand they might turn on my fridge too for all i really know
since ive never messed with hollys before.
the next question is will this make my stock 1600 run hotter?
all this is in a 1970 westy that goes about 70 miles round trip per day to
work at whidby island...

thanks

chaz
