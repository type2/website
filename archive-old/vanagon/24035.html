Subject: Road sign interpretations - (F)

While driving up to Northern California two weeks ago, we got 
little bored and came up with some road sign interpretations
that were a little strange.....

Looking at a map of the San Pablo Bay area near Vallejo,
we saw a piece of text that said, &quot;Not Entirely Open to the Public&quot;.

On the 101 south of Fortuna, a sign read:
BURNING PERMITS REQUIRED
We pulled over and burned all our permits, poured water on
the ashes and proceeded southbound.

Another one read:
LITTER REMOVAL AREA  courtesy of  THE BROKEN HAND STORE
We were going to start removing litter from the camper, but we didn't.
What if the folks at the Broken Hand Store decided to give us a free
sample?  Ouch!


Ok, ok, it may not be funny, but at least I was in a TypeII when
I thought all this weird sh!t up.  It is Friday, isn't it?
