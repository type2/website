&gt; movie: The Commitments
&gt;        
&gt;        set in Ireland, about the life and times of a bunch of
&gt;        young musicians...
&gt; 
&gt;        at one point in the film, they cruse around in a 
&gt;        really nice later model (post 68) single cab.
&gt;        complete with a Piano in the bed..
&gt; 
&gt;        It's a cool scene...
&gt; 
&gt;        check out the cool towel rack looking bumpers on this
&gt;        truck...
&gt; 
&gt;        BTW, it's a good movie...

Yeah, but one of the bastards kicks it in one scene.  Not cool.  :(
