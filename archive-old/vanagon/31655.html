Subject: Please help with carb, timing, &amp; idle!

PREFACE:

I have been tuning up my engine. I got the valves adjusted, then I got the
points adjusted and checked them with the dwell meter. Everything A-OK.
Martin Sage gave me some timing specifications for a Bosch 009, and I
placed the timing marks on my pulley to those specs.

My car would not idle, so per instructions of my parts supplier and
VW-knowledge guy, I adjusted the idle speed adjusting screw and Lola did
idle...a little rough but I was just happy that she was idling on her
own...

I went to check the timing with the strobe and AAARRGGHHH! The timing mark
I was looking at was the 180degree from TDC mark I made for adjusting the
valves...the correct timing marks were no where _near_ the engine block
crack...

I checked the RPM on my meter...Lola was (and still is) idling at around
1600rpm!  I tried to adjust her down to 800rpm, but she sputts and dies.


QUESTIONS:

`- Would the fast idle be the problem with the timing mark not coming into view
   properly?

`- Will I need to adjust the idle properly at around 800rpm before timing,
or
   can I rev it up to 3000rpm and time from there, as suggested by the 009
   specs?

`- Where do I need to check for vacuum leaks on the carb?

`- CONCERNING THE CARB ADJUSTMENT:

   - How should the throttle valve stop screw be adjusted?  I used the
     instructios in Bentey, but don't know which notch the screw should be
     adjusted with:

                         /            Third Notch, slightly curved
                       +-
                      /
                    /                Forth Notch, even more curved
              ----- +
