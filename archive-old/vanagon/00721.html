Subject:      WESTFALIA WANDERERS/Canadian van club (name?) postponed...

The Westfalia Wanderers joint meet with the Canadians has been scrapped for
this year. It will probably happen next year so be looking for it. The
SEPTEMBER meet of the Charles Abilene Chapter (based in West Virginia) will be
held at a park near Huntington, WV. As soon as I can find my dammned paper
again I'll give the actual details.
