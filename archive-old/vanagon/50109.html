Subject: I'm at the end of my rope!

Hi Bob (&amp; Vangoners!!),

        I don't know much of anything about watercooled VW's, but the good
folks on the Vanagon list do. Before we split into Aircooled and
Watercooled lists I used to see all kinds of discussion on these types of
issues, so maybe they can be of help to you. I'm cc'ing this to them, but
if you check out my web page it has subscription info for the list, and the
location of the archives-which go back for several years. Someone somewhere
has to know the solution to your problem! Best of luck in finding it...

&gt;Eddie,
&gt;
&gt;Hope you can help.  I'm at the end of my rope!  My 1991 Vanagon (which is
&gt;my 3rd VW Van and 6th VW overall since 1968), is driving me crazy!  Back in
&gt;May it starting having a random problem of stalling out after driving for
&gt;30 minutes or so.  All I could do was coast over to the side of the road
&gt;and wait.  After a random amount of time (from 20 minutes to an hour), my
&gt;Van would start up again and be fine for a day or a week.
&gt;
&gt;My VW specialist mechanic (who I have used for 15 years!) tried everything
&gt;and could find nothing wrong.  After consulting with other VW specialists
&gt;they conclude that it was either the Air Flow Sensor or the Fuel Injection
&gt;Computer.
&gt;
&gt;He suggested a new Air Flow Sensor since that goes bad statistically more
&gt;often.  The new Sensor seemed like it fixed it at first!  After a few days,
&gt;my Van stopped again with the same symptoms.  It would restart if I let it
&gt;rest for 30 minutes.
&gt;
&gt;So now my mechanic said he was sure it was the Fuel Injection Computer.  So
&gt;I bought one of those too.  This seemed to do the trick although my bill
&gt;was close to $1500!!!!
&gt;
&gt;My Van ran fine during June, July, August, and September, but now... the
&gt;problem is BACK!!!!
&gt;
&gt;Have you every heard of such a problem with VW Vanagons?  I can't affort to
&gt;spend $1500 everything 5 months!!
&gt;
&gt;If you have any information or know of other Web Sites that might help,
&gt;please let me know.  The WWW.VW.COM web site was completely useless for
&gt;this type of thing!!
&gt;

Peace,
