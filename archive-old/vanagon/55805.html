&gt;Anyone know anyway to drain the water out of the water tank in a camper?  
&gt;The water in mine has been in there a while, and I would like to put 
&gt;fresh water in there once it gets warm enough to camp again.

On the Vanagon Westie, there is a cap that unscrews below the tank.  It's
at the rear driver's side, just forward of the rear wheel.
