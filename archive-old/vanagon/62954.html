hey steve and jo ann,
thats exactly what I think. my 58 westy ist still running 
and a brave old car, but- 5th engine (four of them were 
used ones) and 3rd gearbox (and only 122 k KM). and 
everybody tells me what a great car it is. har har har. i 
know a man in berlin, who has got his 66 westy since 30 
years and 300kKM (200kmls) but with engine no. 3 (all brand 
new).
and nearly every 1.9 or 2.1 l that i have heard about did 
150kKMs without big problems-when the right volkswagens 
coolant was used and regulary changed. and the 
mitsuyota-bus of my collegue did the same 150kKMs - and 
then the head had two big cracks...

our experience with these waterboxers is: they are 
wonderful engines for good 100kmls (under german 
circumstances) and once they get any head-problems there is 
exactly one way to repair: original volkswagen exchange 
engine (factory rebuild). expensive, ok (about ca. 2200 
us$) but then youve got another trouble-free 100kmls.
its the same with the gear-boxes, exept autos.

i think, the problem is, that most people expect a car, 
that is 50times more comfortable and easier and nicer to go 
in than the &quot;good old aircooled&quot;  but wont understand, that 
this all has to be payed for with more technic. no, a 
engine overhaul cant be done for a fiver in uncle bens 
garage on a lazy saturdays evening. 
but go back again in a split-bus for a 300mls day-trip and 
you know what for.

please excuse my terrible english.
best wishes from wolfsburg
