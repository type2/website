I'll try to find the words for you, Sstones et. al for Hot Rod
Lincoln.  If I fail, I ought at least to be able to find some
sort of historical info on this song.  It's sort of the
predecessor of Beep Beep (While riding in My Cadillac) -
the song about how the little Nash Rambler beats the caddy....
