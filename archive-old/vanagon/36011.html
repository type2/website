On Fri, 23 Feb 1996 09:18:53 -0600 you said:
&gt;regarding what to do when and I couldn't find anything that said that
&gt;the coolant should be flushed and replaced every two years. I checked
&gt;the owner's manual, the maintenance manual, and the Bentley shop manual.
&gt;Does anyone know where this &quot;recommendation&quot; came from?

that's the really wierd part ... VW never says it!!! but if you call the
number for the tech help of BASF, the people who make the coolant, THEY
tell you to replace it every two years. also, Robert Sikorsky says to do
it in his several books about &quot;How to Drive Your Car Forever&quot; (and some
other books i can't remember the title of).
