The only thing to watch out for is stressing the upper shock mount to the
point where it breaks apart.  Coil Assist Springs (or Coil Assist Shocks) are
great for handling heavy loads in a breadloaf, but should never be considered
to raise the rear end due to sagging torsion bars.  The same advice applies
to using Air Shocks - another no-no.  Itsa b***h to replace that upper shock
mount on a late (69-79) bus. I had to do this twice - one on a 69 Westie and
another on a 73 Panel.  NOT FUN :-(
