Subject: What is fair continued

     Ok, I finally drove the 1989 Westfalia GL with 115k miles.  Some of 
     the things wrong with it are: missing VW emblem from rear hatch, 
     struts for rear hatch don't support it, needs one knob for stove, 
     needs left side passenger seat armrest, and the dash lights and rear 
     wiper motor don't work.  Their is a medium scratch on the sliding door 
     other wise the rest of the body is very clean.  The seller originally 
     bought it off of a VW lot in Colorado who told him the heads had been 
     redone at 80k.  He lived out of it for six full weeks, so it 
     definitely has been used.  He is also asking $11,500 which I was going 
     to offer $9500, but am now having second thoughts.  HELP!!
