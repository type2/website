Subject: Re: window rubber: removing those unsightly plastic thingies



I seem to remember reading a description along with photos and a diagram
of the installation of those &quot;in the rubber&quot; trim bits. I think it was
done in the car. The gadget used was very simple, it spread the cracjk and
fed the trim into it. 
I swa this in a British DIY bodywork book which I believe is still at home
(not on loan!). I'll check tonight.
