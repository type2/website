Subject: Cars for sale

To everyone-
Thanks for the large response to the cars for sale. Here is more info 
on them:
'59 Double Door Panel Van- It was used in Denver as an ice cream 
truck until recently. The van has been converted to 12V, run/drives
but needs a resto. The nose has some bondo and there is a rust hole 
near the drivers feet and around the battery. The dash has no holes
and includes a radio 
delete plate and correct 70mph speedo. The cab divider is there but 
is in sorry shape. The Bullets and small taillights are there, and so 
are the bumpers. The mfg. date is 12/31/58. $3300

'57 Karmann Ghia Coupe- Brilliant Red color, New Mexico car, 
beige interior, 36 hp w/ good compression, runs/drives. The car has a 
Blaupunkt L/M radio, Euro bumpers, fender mount side mirrors,
NOS taillight lenses, dent in center of nose. I would like to sell 
this one with a '58 Ghia convertible project car. It is 1 of 1325, 
has an early Ghia trip speedo, Ghia gas heater, orig. drivetrain, 
weateherd, rusty pan, straight nose,  have extra pan, and US 
bumpers,  letter from Germany. $4900/pr. 

Also: '64 T34 Ghia project $1500
