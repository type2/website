&gt;I looked at an '87 Westfalia today, Syncro, very nice, 67K miles. It's a GL 
&gt;with locking rear differential and no other options as far as I could tell. 
&gt;The owner is asking $17,500. Is this a reasonable price? I know these are 
&gt;pretty rare, but do they really go for this much?

Let me know where I can get that much for an '87 Synrco GL!!!  I'll take mine
(that I paid $6995 for) sell it and take the profit and get a Syncro Westy
for the $17,500!!

That price is about twice what it's worth.
