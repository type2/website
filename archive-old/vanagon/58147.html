Subject: CV Joints

Well answered for definite a couple nagging questions the other day, 
looking at the 4 new Lobro CV's from Bus Depot, some things became 
clear, the chamfer on the cage goes toward the driveshaft, as I 
recall being correct but could never quite verify in photographic 
evidence.  I could not verify the direction of the inner race step, 
as it is not present on later joints, but I feel it went toward the 
thrust washer origionally.  I also note a few things, genuine Lobro 
no longer have cages that the balls &quot;snap&quot; into, the cage is a tight 
sliding fit on the balls, sort of interesting.  The one '88 joint has 
the snap in ball cage unlike the later ones.  After '93 the joints 
are marked merely Germany, not W Germany and interesting sign of the 
times.  The real interesting thing is this though, the newest ('94) 
joints have an almost &quot;annodized&quot; (if they were aluminum instead of 
steel) grey coating to the outer races and are much more smoothly 
machined.  The intersting thing about that is that they are identical 
matches to the generic &quot;rebuilt&quot; (which had to be brand new) joints I 
had been buying from Transform for $39 each previously, which were 
unmarked as to manufacturer but were marked Germany.  However 
Transform no longer sells them, sort of wonder though if the 
Transfrom joints were Lobro rejects, have not had a problem with them 
though.  I also note this, because the literature with the Transform 
joints had made a point about how the new &quot;loose&quot; cage was actually 
an improvement and would reduce wear and extend joint life, implying 
that an initially slightly loose joint properly lubricated was better 
than the old tight style.  All in all quite happy, we'll see how they
hold up in my evil rubber boots once I build a nice set of axles for the
'85, now that I got the sandblast cabinet finally running I can really clean 
and paint axles like the factory intended.
