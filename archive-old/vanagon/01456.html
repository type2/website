Subject: auxillary battery

A recent message suggested getting a catalog from Weber Power Products of 
Scotsdale, AZ for good auxillary battery accessories. I can't find the 
phone number for this outfit. Does anyone out there have a number or 
address for them.

I haven't been able to find a size 41 deep cycle battery to fit under the 
drivers seat. I'm convinced that they aren't made by anyone in the U.S. 
So I'm contemplating using  a size U1 deep-cycle snowmobile/wheelchair 
battery. But it's only 45 amp hour.
