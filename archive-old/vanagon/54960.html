Subject: Adding on gauges

A recent post talked about add ons including the following gauges :oil
temp, oil press, cyl head temp, volt meter. How does one do that or better
yet as I am a newcomer, is there a shop local the the sf bay area that
anyone can reccomend to work on an 81 vanagon?

Thanks

maggie
