Subject: soft top for '66


Hi there!

My '66 Westy is now certified, and will be plated tomorrow!  Now, on to 
the next project:-)

I'm restoring a '66 deluxe roof right now an I was wondering if anyone has
instructions/pictures of the sunroof to help me figger out what goes 
where!?!?  Currently I have a box full of parts and very little idea of how 
to put the puzzle together.

I'm about to order a new sunroof cover for said deluxe roof since I have to
order a new roof for my bug 'vert:-(.  Are there any other parts I should 
order at the same time?  Bushings, sliders etc?

If anyone is interested in pictures of the bus (or the new/old roof, or the 
box of parts) please let me know:-)

...Markus
