Subject: Re: Piston pins


Bob Hoover wrote an excellent sermon on persuading gudgeon pins in and out:

&gt;Any fool can pound on things and most of us do, at one time or another.
&gt; Unfortunately, we usually causing more harm than good in the process.

Outstanding. Thanks. It never would have occured to me to go at it from
inside the pins rather than trying to engulf the things in some sort of
huge contraption. Makes a great deal of sense.

The rods you recommended from SIR got here today; you'll recall my problem
with promiscuous rod bearings? On pre-assembly these are better.

Ever known anybody to weld a head cracked in between the spark plug holes?
Think I can pull this off?
