Subject: Re: Should I buy this 66 Deluxe

&gt;1500 sp runs strong rebuilt at least once, this guy bought from
&gt;origional owner who had it rebuilt in the 70's, big oil sump installed
&gt;at that time.
&gt;
&gt;no nasty gear box/ reduction gear noise, moves under its own motive
&gt;power in all gears to 40 mph (as fast as I dared), brakes work

&gt;The best part, this guy says, well I got $100 in it, yours for $175...

It's worth it for the tranny and engine alone.
I'd buy it and send my '68 Bug to heaven (or a good home)...

I spent $300 for its kin (white/red) a couple of years ago, just for the tranny.
