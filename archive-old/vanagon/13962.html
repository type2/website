Subject: RE: A 1979 camper needs your help!

&gt; The short answer is: Any type IV engine &lt;'72 or later bus, any 914/4,
&gt;  411/412&gt; will fit. Caveats are: You will need the exhaust system, since

Another caveat? As I remember it a 1700/1800 Type IV engine AND gearbox will
bolt into the 79 body.  However, a 1700/1800 Type IV will not bolt 'straight
up to' a 2 litre gearbox - the bellhousings/starter mounts are different????
