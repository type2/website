Subject: Vanagon Side Window Glass

Thanks to all that offered their kind help on my questions regarding
getting and installing the sliding glass in the sliding door of my Westy.=
 =

My mechanic, Coby Smolens, in San Anselmo, CA, obtained said glass and
lower guide piece from the local VW dealer.  My particular glass has the
latch in the center of the pane (did you folks know that there are two
varieties - the other is shorter and with the latch toward the front of t=
he
glass?).  The glass and guide piece were sold as separate parts, but the
guide piece came with the nylon sliders already in place.  Coby U.P.S'd t=
he
(well packed) parts to a Mexican package courier, who then forwarded them=

directly to me here in San Miguel de Allende, Guanajuato.  They arrived,
safe and sound, in record time - four business days!  Even the Mexicans
we've met here were thoroughly amazed.  Anyway, I thought I might try
installing it myself, but then I thought better of it - I was unsure as t=
o
exactly how to attach the lower guide piece to the glass, and I was fearf=
ul
of breaking the glass in the processes of doing so.  So, I trundled on do=
wn
to the VW agency here.  They said &quot;no problem,&quot; and 2 1/2 hours and $N200=

pesos later, my glass was safely back in place.  The VW shop rate here is=

$N86/hour (~$11 U.S./hour).  I also enjoyed perusing the brand new Beetle=
s
on the lot while I waited for my Westy.  They cost about $6,500 U.S.  Too=

bad you can't bring one home, eh?

Cheers,

David
