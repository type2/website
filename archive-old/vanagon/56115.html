Subject: Re: If you've replaced your CV joints--please read

Hi Volks,
   I've read a post about CV joints and had to add my 2 cents.
  When I first bought my current vanagon I started having trouble with
one of the CV's making noise. IT only the second time I've had trouble
with VW CV's.  Being the penny pincher that I am, I had a set of used CV
shafts from a '79 bus kicking around and I cleaned and used them on my
bus.  So far I haven't had any trouble. If your in a real bind you can
use the inner joint from a Golf or Jetta too.  I've also been told, for
you really cheap volks, that you could try reversing the shaft on the
bus so that they turn in the opposite direction. The threory is that the
pressure on the CV is in a different spot than the worn spot making the
CV usable again.  Doing this will buy you some time. 
	  I also noticed and  I'm not sure if this is true for all VW CV joints
but all of the ones I have done for VW buses are all marked with a date
of manufacter. Just in case your wondering if your CV joint is original
or not.  Mine were marked 12/82. Now one side is marked 5/79. 
    BTW, if your having trouble with your CV's and your not into packing
new joints there is a place in Lebannon, NY call Axle Express (518)
794-6100, that sell rebuilt CV shafts for Vanagons and Buses for about
100 dollars, ready to install.
