Subject: Corona de Tucson (Definitive directions to...)

Regarding the directions to the Arizona Bus Club's &quot;Corona de TucsonII&quot;
event (2/22-23/1997) Near Tucson, Arizona USA.

Good old helpful &quot;Steve S.&quot; at steves_at_indy_dot_net said:

If you haven't found it yet, take the Vail/ Helveta south off 
of I-10 to Houghton, west to Sahvarita, north to Corona de Tucson.
Hope this helps, got it from DeLorme's Street Atlas USA.

Thanks Steve! You are quite the helper. Now maybe I can be quiet about the
event until February! =)
