So matt weasner says:
&gt; 1) the icebox is just that, correct? put some ice in and go? The reason
&gt; I wanted to check is because of the electrical outlets on the other side. 

Yes, it's just and icebox and nothing more.  The socket on the outside is only 
used as a junction to get AC 110V to the electrical outlet on the inside.  
It's used for plug-in stuff at camp grounds with electrical access.

&gt; I don't know where you would fit all of the parts necessary for an actual
&gt; refridge, but then again, after trying to replace one of the bulbs in the
&gt; dash, I can see how vw would try to wedge them in. :)

I'm not sure, but JC Whitney probably sells one that will fit into the
ice box cabinet.

&gt; 2) how does the sink get its water supply? 

I thought there was a cap on top of the sink or just under it where
you could pour in the water.  Yours might have one on the outside,
but I don't remember.

&gt; 3) as far as the outside electrical hookup, I plan on taking a look 
&gt; at it (i.e. rip it apart) before plugging anything in, but is there
&gt; any thing in particular that you folks have found that tends to screw
&gt; up that I should look for?

Well, I wouldn't work on it until you got familiar with what type of
socket you're dealing with.  I'm sure that if you find the right manual,
it would give you some better insight about it....
