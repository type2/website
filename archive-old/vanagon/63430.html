Subject:      Jalousie Windows

The comments over the last two days about jalousie windows for Vanagons
prompt me to tell my story.  I put a set of jalousies I got off a mid-70s=

salvage yard bus into my 84 Westy.  This was about five years ago.  Yes,
the 70's window frames are smaller than the Vanagon openings.  Yes, you
have to build up the frames to make them fit.  I used plastic window
glazing, the kind that comes in a big sheet.  Just measured the rectangul=
ar
cut-out required for the 70's window and cut it with a jigsaw.  As I
recall, the Vanagon window frames are about 3/8&quot; thick, so to make the
glazing fit snugly into the rubber molding I doubled the glazing, glued i=
t
together with clear silicone, then drilled holes through the 70's frame a=
nd
through the glazing and screwed the whole assembly together with stainles=
s
hardware.  Shoved the rubber on, vaselined them up good, and popped them
into the Vanagon openings.  That was five years ago and they haven't leak=
ed
or cracked yet!  And the other guy who claimed he was gonna do the same j=
ob
with aluminum has YET to get the job done...
  ;-}

AND, an awning is also a great feature for camping.  I have an A&amp;E
awning/screen-room combo for camping.  But the jalousies are great for wh=
en
you want excellent ventilation but don't have time to set up the awning,
such as driving breaks.  I basically leave the jalousies open all summer.=
