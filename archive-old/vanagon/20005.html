Subject: Emissions Failure

Hello everyone!!

Last i talked to everyone i was trying to sell my syncro.  We'll i just
couldn't do it!!  My wife is pissed, but i think she knows things would be
worse if i got rid of it.  My problem is that i'm due for emissions in
connecticut in a couple of weeks.  (connecticut has gotten really severe
concerning emissions). Last time thru i failed terribly and had to get
waived.  Of course this is after spending some big bucks and it still failed.
The dealer is no help, he said they all fail.  I've changed everything except
the control unit, including  all new sensors, new air flow box, new coil, new
air filter, plugs etc, etc.  The thing is running real rich.  My heads were
replaced by vw at around 50k miles.( current mileage around 70k)  My
compression is around 140.  Dealer said that the control unit is working
properly, but i doubt he knows what he is talking about.  I,ve checked  the
voltage at the O2 sensor and it is around 0.7 volts at idle.  This is too
high.  What else is there left to check. ie. timing, idle??  The thing runs
good.  By the way the dealer said he knew that somthing was wrong when he
heard it idle.  He said it sounded too good and that these things idled rough
off the show room floor.  What the hell does that mean????

Thanks
