&gt; I shortened an allen wrench (8mm) while I was doing my clutch.  I went
&gt; through several hacksaw blades and then I got smart (ok....my dad got
&gt; smart) and bought one of those cable things with the carbide bits all over
&gt; it.  Can't remember what they're called, but it DID cut through.

One suggestion, GRINDER, good allen wrenches are slightly hardened
steel (not that hard as hardened goes actually) the only typical
way to machine hardened steel is with carbide tools or to grind
it, just one more reason to have an angle grinder actually.
