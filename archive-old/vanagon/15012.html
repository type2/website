G'day, eh?

Just found that the right inboard brake piston is leaking
around the boot. I just rebuilt these a couple of months
ago. Grr. Anyway, I'd like a show of hands from those of
you who think a new set of seals will do the trick, and from
those pessimists who think a new caliper is in order.

FWIW...There doesn't seem to be any pulling, or difference
in the pedal. I'm just going through a top reservoir of 
brake fluid every 2-3 days and it ends up on the wheel and
in the wheel well.....
