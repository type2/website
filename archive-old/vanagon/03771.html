    There was a split-window single cab pickup on &quot;The Commish&quot; last
night. There was a car chase in progress, and it came driving happily
down the road. I was surprised to see it, and relieved that they didn't
smash into it, as I've seen on other shows. Anyway nothing important.

P.S. C.H.I.P.s is a great show for splits and late model viewing...
