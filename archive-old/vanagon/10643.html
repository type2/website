Subject: I'm confused about '79s

Sami mentioned this in a recent post:

&gt;And, if I'm not mistaken, the 78 and
&gt;79'ers have a swiveling front passenger seat.
&gt;

Several people have also recently mentioned that the 79 bus had a slightly 
wider body. Were these changes made on North American models only? I have 
never seen a bay window bus that didn't have any of those panels behind the 
front seats (except when they had been chopped out by the owner) and when I 
see body panels in parts catalogues they are listed as suitable for 73 to 79 
models. This even includes the front panel, so where did the extra inches go?
