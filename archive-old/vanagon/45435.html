&gt;Lately my Van has begun to hesitate occasionally while driving around
&gt;town. This is not the classic &quot;harness cured&quot; problem that I suffered for
&gt;a number of years until VW isolated the problem. That had to do with
&gt;prolonged driving on the interstate: this is low speeds around town and it
&gt;disappears on the interstate. I replaced the fuel filter but, alas, that
&gt;didn't do it.

&gt;Any thoughts? Thanks, Nelson Hogg

Oxygen sensor?
Catalytic convertor?
Spark plugs?
Spark plug wires?

Good luck,
