&gt;Bill Kennedy asks how I like my Volvo seats. They are not ideal as they do
&gt;indeed sit somewhat higher than the stock seats, which can be a problem
&gt;for anyone shorter than I (177cm, 5'9&quot;?), as their feet would dangle like
&gt;those of a five-year old without touching the floor. The thicker backrest
&gt;also forces the seat further to the front, which might force a *very* tall
&gt;person's knee caps against the dash. To install the seats as low as
&gt;possible, I had to remove the sliding front/back adjusting mechanism,
&gt;hence the seats can no longer be moved. Finally, the height of the
&gt;backrests also prevents us from installing the child's cot while
&gt;camping. 

&gt;A better choice might be a pair of Porsche seats, which take up less 
&gt;space (David S.?). The low profile seats out of a Honda Civic or CRX 

I have some of the same problems.  Removed the sliding mechanisms to save
headroom (I'm 6'0).  The seats I chose were from a Porsche 924.  Black
vinyl with tall integrated headrests and thick side bolsters.  I chose
these seats for two reasons.  First, they were thin.  By that I mean
that the seatbacks and bottoms are very flat (not thick) much like the
original bus seats.  I sat in Sami's Volvo seats, and while they were
very plush I lost a good deal of visibility out of the side window, and
since I spend a lot of time looking out the window when traveling, I
decided I needed a &quot;flat&quot; seat.  Installed, the Porsche seats are
provide roughly the same ride height as the original seats.  For people
over about 5'10&quot; I would definately recommend these seats.  The second
reason I chose these seats was price.  I stumbled across them in a
junkyard, and they happened to be on sale.  I walked out with the pair
for $45.  Since then, I have been keeping my eyes on the 924's in the
junkyard, and haven't seen a pair of seats in decent shape.  I guess I
really got lucky that day.  I spend a lot of Saturdays wandering around
junkyards hot, dirty, and tired and every once in a while it pays off.  :)

The one possibly negative thing about these seats is that they are deep.
The bottom of the seat is &quot;longer&quot; than it is wide.  This is slightly
less convenient for entry and exit, and might be uncomfortable for
some people under 6 feet tall.  Shelley and I were perfectly comfortable 
in them, though, for all of GNATT (8,000 miles in 4 weeks).
