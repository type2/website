So Martha Rubin says:
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;.......this assumes your version of camping includes electrical hook-ups..
&gt; 
&gt; That ain't camping.....IMHO....&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Ha!!!!!!!!!!!!  Can I believe my eyes?  This coming from Steve -
&gt; the Steve we all know and love who REFUSES to travel without
&gt; his porta potty????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Excuse me Mrs. I gotta have a shower/power for my stereo/and my Flo-Bee
(which who knows what the Hell you need that at a camp ground for!!!/
gotta have my shower within 12 hours or I'll turn to stone.... But the
porta-potti was originally for my wife!  If you don't watch it, you'll
get more than pee on your tires.  ;p
