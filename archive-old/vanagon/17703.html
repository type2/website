Subject: Re: Tires &amp; Wheels for '89 Vanagon


&gt;Now the question is, where could I get 6 x 15s with the correct offset?
&gt;Don't Chevy (perish the thought) wheels have the same bolt pattern?  Any
&gt;suggestions???

Mercedes vans have exactly the right size wheels, and bolt pattern, and even 
look fairly similar to the stock ones. They easy to get here in the UK but 
probably not that common in your part of the world, so I'm not really being 
a lot of help am I :(
