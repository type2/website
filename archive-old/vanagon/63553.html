Subject: a/c parts search

Hey all,
	I've been told by my local VW dealer that my a/c system is contaminated
with rust. They gave me a long expensive list of a/c parts and work that I
will need. I think that I might as well convert to the 134A refrigerant if
I have to buy a lot of new parts. Anyway, I'm researching parts suppliers
to accomplish this project. I noticed someone posted a supplier named
Vintage Air but without a phone #, can anyone on the list help me find this
number? Thanks.
