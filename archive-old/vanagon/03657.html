Subject: coolant replacement

I've been worried because after replacing my water pump and flushing and 
draining and refilling the cooling system, I ended up putting barely two 
gallons of coolant back into the system. Today I was pondering what I was 
going to do for the winter since I don't have an auxiliary heater in the 
back when it hit me!...I don't have an auxiliary heater!!! That's the 
answer. I didn't use as much coolant as called for because I'm missing 
this piece of the system.  What a relief!  Wheew.

Now....has anyone on the list put a replacement heater in?   Any hints on 
sources?  One of my ideas is to take the parts of the A/C system and put 
together a heater out of that.  It's got a fan and a heat exchanger, but 
I'd have to build some brackets....wouldn't be too hard, but if I could 
find one for under $100, it'd be hard to resist.

Also, I still have an almost new muffler for sale that I bought in error 
while on our Utah trip.
