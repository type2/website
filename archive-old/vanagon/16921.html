Subject: Re: Rear heater core-how to get cover off??

&gt; Greetings all!
&gt;   Well I'm back on the road and , tired of my wife complaining out clothes
&gt;smell like antifreeze, finally looking at that rear heater core.
&gt;As I look at it there are 6 screws [removed]. The cover is loose but cannot
&gt;be lifted because it catches on the plastic heater duct directing louvres
&gt;sort of things.
&gt;  I know this has been rehashed every  month of so [sorry i wasnt listening!]
&gt;Could someone please email me how to disassemble the cover?
&gt; Thanks in advance,

Bill:

It appeared to me that there was no way of removing it without removing the
rear seat.  It's awkward and it looks like more of a pain than it turns out
to be.  Remove the four large bolts and carefully pull out the seat with the
folding mechanism.  Make note of the routing of the seatbelts before you
take it out, though...  I had a hard time remembering and they will affect
the folding mechanism.  By the way, I'm assuming that you have the rear seat
that folds flat into a bed (in combination with the upholstered cushion over
the engine hatch.  My rear heater was leaking at the flange where the hoses
come in to the control valve, this flange is plastic and held together by
two small bolts.  I disasembled this and used that blue form-a-gasket stuff
to reassemble (after cleaning the old gasket material off).  It's held
pretty well so far--although I still smell coolant when I first run the heater.
