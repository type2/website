I think that we should all be required to keep individual 1.44 MB floppies
for each list member documenting every piece of correspondence ever done by
that member.  These should be tagged, kept in a fire safe, with additional
backups also kept in fire safes, and then at the end of every 'net session,
we be required to back up the 'net session on Digital Audio Tape.  These
backup tapes should be kept for 3 years each in seperate safe deposit boxes,
then sent to the library of congress for archive purposes.

That should keep us from forgetting what kinds of cars the other listmembers
are driving!

My organizational skills are unparalelled!!!  (havin' fun with ya)
