Subject:      Windsheild Installation

Warren,

I just replaced my windshield in my 81.  Twas pretty easy, except
getting the old one out.  I found a windshield at a junkyard and wanted
to use my existing seal.  I had to beat out the existing glass with a
hammer, which was and still is quite a mess.  I recommend taping the
windshield all over if you're going to use that method.  If you buy a
new seal, the job is at least a whole lot less messy, because you can
just cut the old seal out and lift out the old windshield, as I did at
the junkyard.
Once you get the old windshield and seal out, wrap the seal around the
new windshield and then take string and run it around the outside groove
of the seal, so it goes all the way around and overlaps itself.  Then
fit the bottom part of the windshield into the VW frame, and with a
screwdriver or something begin to slip the lip of the seal over the
frame.  Make sure the ends of the string that is strung around the seal
are inside the van.  When you get it spaced correctly and begin to get
it in, you can then pull the string around the seal from the inside of
the van in a manner with pulls the lip of the seal over and into the
inside edge of the VW frame.  Just pull all the way around until the
inside lip is all the way in.
This job takes a little patience and pushing, but it will go in.  It
took me about an hour and a half one a.m. before work.  I don't
recommend the hammer removal, as I spend the rest of the a.m. in the
hospital getting a sliver of glass removed from my eye.  ;)  Ouch.
Having a couple doctors hanging over your stretched open eye with black
lights and dye isn't that much fun.  And they had nice breath...I'm glad
they weren't coffee drinkers.

Good luck!

&gt;
&gt; Hi to all in Vanagonland.
&gt; My 81 Westy is a very nice fella.  However, he needs many things
&gt; attended to at once.  Thanks to all of you who have provided
&gt; information
&gt; about the various heat sources.  I want a Propex Heater and will try
&gt; to
&gt; get one.  Now, I turn to some of the other issues facing BaseCamp.  My
&gt; front windshield is cracked.  Is it a really big job to replace a
&gt; windshield or would it be more prudent to take it to a local glass
&gt; shop
&gt; for replacement (is one brand of glass as good as another)?  The BIG
&gt; project I wish to undertake is a two piece roof rack.  I want one
&gt; which
&gt; conforms to the shape of the top and which stretches from end to end
&gt; (custom made, of course).  Do any of you know someone who is
&gt; particularly proficient at rack-making or manufacturing?  I can
&gt; provide
&gt; drawings.  Of course, I want the rack to be strong but light, i.e.,
&gt; made
&gt; of some hollow tubing of some kind.  In addition, I am thinking of
&gt; having a ladder made to go up from the front bumper in front of the
&gt; windshield on the passenger side.  Semi permanent mounted, I think.
&gt; Has
&gt; anyone tried this before?
&gt; Many thanks.
