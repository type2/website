Thanks Joel,

If I have all the brackets and such from the '86, could I fit the '84
compressor onto these to have the proper connections? I'm new to this ac
stuff, so please forgive the ignorance.

&gt; it'll &quot;work&quot;, but it's likely that the connections are NOT in the proper
&gt; place for the 86 lines. :(
