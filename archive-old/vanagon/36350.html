&gt;        There's one thing that I find puzzling about their injection
&gt;system:  how does it determine the quantity of air entering the engine?
&gt;The Bosch systems that I've read about (D, J, L &amp; K) all have some sort of
&gt;device which measures the incoming air directly (e.g. air mass sensor) or
&gt;indirectly (e.g. manifold pressure sensor).  Does the CB system just make
&gt;an estimation via the throttle position &amp; rpm?  Is this adequate?  Is this
&gt;why the low- and high-speed mixture control knobs are included on the
&gt;control unit?
&gt;
&gt;

I don't know if this system is made by holley.  I've used that set-up on
Camaros anf Mustangs.  I does rely on throttle position and RPM.  An oxygen
sensor can be aded as an option.  the unit was great for horsepower, flat
out.  Driveability and linear fuel control was nightmareidh.  Both of those
customers put the carbs back on. Even after spending all that money.  Make
sure this is what you want before buying.  Will need emeission analyzer to
set-up.  Actualy, probably needs Dyno.
