Subject: Heater invention

We are thinking of many different ways to heat our bus and here is 
one we might try.  We will place some coils of copper pipe wherever 
the hottest logical spot is in or around the engine compartment.  
Then we will run some insulated tubing up to the fresh air intake in 
front of the cabin. A radiator small enough to fit inside the big 
&quot;air distrubition chamber&quot; will be located here.  Then the return 
tubing with the cooler water (or antifreze) will have the inline pump 
(maybe a strong bilge pump) that does most of the work.  
                             
                            = ~ ~ ~       
             cold  -&gt; -&gt; -&gt; = ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ warm
                            = ~ ~ ~

Please, go ahead and tell us what is wrong with this idea.

We installed one of those inline blowers, but we opted for the 
larger (4inch) model.  This one puts out 230cfm, but draws 3.8amps.  
The price was $16.99 (40 cents more than the 3inch, but we gained an 
extra 90cfm)
