Subject: 1984 Vanagon For Sale

One of my neighbors would like to sell her 1984 Vanagon.  This one is Cream
over Light Blue has around 115,000 miles with 30,000 miles on a factory
supplied new engine.  She just had $700 worth of new radiator pipes
installed and it has been recently tuned.  The body is in fair to average
condition with some inevitable damage to the rear bumper.  I've driven the
van and it seems stronger than my '85 GL model but that may be because I
have been lugging mine down with the new AC compressor I had installed
recently.  By the way, the Van is located in Midtown Atlanta.

Interested parties can E-mail me directly at home:  dbax_at_mindspring_dot_com  or
at work: dab1_at_jhk_dot_com  or you may call.  She will be spending the summer in
New Orleans and probably leaving the Van and the title with me.

Second issue:  I found a 1988 Vanagon GL Wolfsburg in the paper with low
miles (whatever that means), they are advertising for close to $7000.
Anyone know what a good counter offer might be?  I've been scouring the
local listings in Atlanta for a slightly newer Vanagon.
