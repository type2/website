Subject: Rebuildable 2liter block 4 sale
Date: Thu, 7 Jul 1994 21:12:52 -0700 (PDT)

When I got my '78, it needed new headers &amp; heater boxes. after pricing 
them _at_ VW I went searching junk yards.  Found an intact '78 engine for 
$200.  Bought it, took the exhaust system  &amp; stowed the block for a rainy 
day.  Four years later, I'm still dry (except for my parents tears for 
crapping up their garage).  In order to cause complete engine failure in 
my (currently functional &amp; just flew through the emission inspecion) bus, 
I am offering this block for $100.  The only guarantee I can offer is 
that I see no holes in the block, so I presume it is rebuildable.  It may 
be brand new for all I know (which ain't much, but I doubt it).  It is 
located in Springfield, VA.  Please reply to:
