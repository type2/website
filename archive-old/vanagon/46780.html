It seems a great many people were salivating on the phone about these today.
 Sold my entire stock and have 20 more pairs coming on Wednesday for an
additional customer backlog of 8 pairs over and above what I had in stock.
 BTW for people who don't know, these are OEM Boge with the part number
(251-413-031C) cast on them - Made in Germany - Price is $49.95ea
(Listmembers' price is $44.96ea).

Didn't think I'd cause this much fuss :-)
