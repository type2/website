Subject: Re: East Coast Inuvik: Labrador!

     Yes! Labrador sounds great to us.

     Lets sketch out a few details, though. Like, how do you get
     there? Drive along the north side of the St. Laurence River, or
     take the ferry, then north on 389 to Labrador City, in the
     interior? What would make the best starting point?

     How much time will we need? The longer the trip, the more difficult
     for more listies to make it...

     When?!?
