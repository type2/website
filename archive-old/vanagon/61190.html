Subject: RE Pls ReSend Color Code

I got two sequential requests from:

   &quot;SMTPGW&quot; &lt;smtpgw.ccittest_at_smtpgw.musc_dot_edu&gt;

to resend my info regarding resistor color codes.  Unfortuately my reply =
to the above address bounced.  

On the off chance that it may also be (again) of use to the list, a =
replay of my initial post follows:

Can't resend exactly, but the information contained in the original =
message
regarding resistor color codes is as follows --

There is a very old and modestly off color [current term is politically
incorrect] ditty to remember the resistor code:


bad =3D&gt;black=3D&gt;0
boys=3D&gt;brown=3D&gt;1
rape=3D&gt;red=3D&gt;2
our=3D&gt;orange=3D&gt;3
young=3D&gt;yellow=3D&gt;4
girls=3D&gt;green=3D&gt;5
but=3D&gt;blue=3D&gt;6
violet=3D&gt;purple=3D&gt;7
gives=3D&gt;gray=3D&gt;8
willingly=3D&gt;white=3D&gt;9

Silver and gold are the tolerance color codes, silver =3D&gt;10%, Gold =3D&gt;5%=
 [and I
don't remember what 1% is, maybe white????

These colored bands are arranged from left to right, starting at the very =
edge
of the resistor body.  The first band is the most significant, the second =
band
the least significant, the third band the multiplier, and the 4th band =
the
tolerance.  Example  39K ohms 10% would be orange white orange silver.
