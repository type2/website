Depends on your definition of &quot;cope with&quot;.  If cope with means reading each
and every message, then yes, you are right.  I go through and delete the
subjects that I'm not interested, and skim the rest.  Takes me 15 - 30
minutes.  For what I get in return, that's a good investment to me.  :-)

PLEASE let's set up some common rules-
&gt;I  (as an air-cooled enthusiast) propose the following rules for this list
&gt;please feed back better suggestions or please comply!!

Okay, but let's call them &quot;suggestions&quot;, okay?  Gerry makes the rules.

&gt;***This can be further refined by sorting out keywords placed IN SUBJECT
&gt;HEADING or at least first line, so I can create folders separately holding
&gt;air-cooled specific queries/comments from general stuff like trip reports
&gt;and show notices.

Don't take this the wrong way, but from reading this it looks like you are
asking the other 600 members of this list to post in a manner that makes it
easier for you personally (and possibly a few select others) to read.

My mail software cannot sort by subject or anything else, and I'm not
willing to shell out $80 for the version that does.  I'm sure many others
are in the same boat.  For us, such tokens in the subjects are useless.  I
agree though that subjects should be as specific as possible, and include
location, and I've noticed that lately most people have been doing pretty
well in that department.

&gt;Suggestions are:
&gt; 1. WC - water cooled specific- just putting &quot;87 Westy in subj helps those
&gt;perusing by eye, but makes it difficult to set up smart sweeps!

I think the year is best.  That and the author are about all I look at.

I'm not really sure what a &quot;smart sweep&quot; is, exactly.  Probably some
Prodigy thing.  I suppose if the filter were flexible to allow you to
specify enough things, I might use it.

SELECT * from VANAGON where (SUBJECT  ! CONTAINS [84:96] || eurovan ||
wasserboxer) || (AUTHOR CONTAINS jwal || gsker || veeduber || busgirl ...)

Sorry my &quot;query&quot; is so bad, but it's been a few years since I did that
stuff.  You get the idea.

&gt;PLEASE CHANGE SUBJECT if &quot;reply&quot; to post changes original subject intent!!

Ummm... yeah.  I'm guilty of that.  I will try and do better.

&gt;-Anyone able to set up separate AC list?  I like this better than the AC
&gt;newsgroup, which requires all that logging on stuff.

Yeah, hate that logging on.  So when are you gonna set up the AC list?  :-)
