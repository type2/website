Dave,

Guess what???  The White one was probably mine (Mountian View-Santa Clara 
Area)!!  We picked it up on Euro Delivery and took it to the 1991 Bad Camberg 
Meet.  What we did was to put every option possible on this one, short of the 
six cylinder wasserboxer.  One of the options was the Oettinger Fog Lamps and 
the bezels from that kit fit from the center grill, around the front corners, 
giving it the appearance of having a wiiiide grill.  The  Oettinger Fog Lamp 
Kit (if it is still available...  they declared the German equivalent of 
Chapter 11 in Feb, '92) will fit all '86 and later vanagons, but cost a pretty 
penny...  I think that, at the exchange rate we had in '91, they cost nearly 
US$500.00!!!!  Next time you see me, give me a wave!!!  BTW, are you heading 
over to Martha's this weekend?  Drop me a line....

       Jon
       '90 (Sicko) Syncro Westie   :'-(

PS: Were you coming home from the Sierras/Central Valley on 580 several 
weekends ago??  If so, we were the ones with Hannover Plates and my wife is 
from Garmish!!

As I was riding my bicycle to work this morning (sunshine, at last!)I spotted
 a BRIGHT Red Vanagon Synchro Westy coming the opposite direction. This unit
 appeared to me to be a recent model with the moulded bumpers and all - every
 thing painted this fire engine red. The radiator grill, the lower one, was
 very small however - only about 10 inches high by 20 inches wide. This was
 especially puzzling to me because only a couple weeks ago, I saw a white
 Syncro Westy with german plates under the California ones that had a radiator
 grill that ran the full width between the turn signals and had fog/driving
 lights built into it. Are these different grills aftermarket items? Were there
 more model variations on Synchros because they were built at Steyr Daimler 
 Puch? Both treatments looked more attractive to me than the standard Vanagon
 grill &lt;but then there's no accounting for taste&gt;.
 
 I'd love to have a Synchro but the cost of ownership is beyond my means &lt;sigh&gt;.


 Dave
