Subject: Re: Class III Trailer Hitch O...

I actually don't tow stuff so this is a good question as to why I am getting
the hitch. The reason is: 

1. $200 is a small amount
2. I may have to tow something some day; I don't want to be limited as to how
big a thing I can tow
3. This is a one time opportunity
4. I can stick my portable Warn 4,000 winch in the receiver hole for the
purpose of winching backwards
5. Perhaps I will want to get a basket thing from Camping World and stick it
in the receiver
6. It offers protection from getting hit from behind
7. It offers protection from when I back up my camper in bolder fields from
smashing my muffer.
