A shop (or someone with the tools), can evac the system. Put a measured
vacuum on it and see if it leaks. 
If it leaks you put a little freon in and fire it up, using a &quot;sniffer&quot; you
find ALL the places it leaks. Evac it again (saving the freon). Fix
whatever is leaking, test it with the vacuum again.
Repeat as (if) necessary until it holds the vacuum. put your old freon back
in, (through a scrubber),(or recycle the old and buy new),top off if
necessary and away you go.

Good luck Ron,
