Subject: RE: Amp output for 1600 generator?


&gt; Anyone know what the amp output on a stock 1600 generator is?


I believe the basic 12V generator had a 30A max output, so your 3A
cooler shouldn't put much of a dent in it. But if you have it running
along with the headlights, windshield wipers, electric choke, interior
dome lights for hardy partiers, Portable TV, and that killer stereo
whose output is rated in horsepower rather than watts, then... keep
an eye on the generator light.

In '74, VW started putting alternators on their upright bug engines.
I believe this is the same alternator available from aftermarket
VW suppliers as an upgrade, and it puts out a lot more than the generator,
which at 30A was not a really high performer. Some of these have found
their way into upright-engine buses that didn't originally have them,
such as my old '69 bus.

Many modern cars now have generators or alternators that put out
60-90 amps, or even higher for some real heavy-duty systems.

BTW, anyone know what the original 6V generators found on '66 and earlier
VWs, were rated at for current output?
