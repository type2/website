I would like to respond to this comment.  I lived in Poland several years
ago, and also in other european countries.  My fondest memories are of
Poland.  There was a genuine niceness towards me.  Of course, no doubt,
some of this must be due to the fact that I am American, but I would not
trade my Polish friends, and the experience that I had living in Poland
for anything.  If you have not been to Poland, you are the one who has
been short-changed.

&gt; I just want to make this one point regarding window screens. There is
&gt; no truth to the rumor that VW routinely provides window screens in
&gt; its Poland-bound campers so that their owners can keep the flys
&gt; IN!
