Subject: Re: alloy wheels

Don't forget to include the Borbett II alloy's.  They come in 15 an 16
inch variety.  I have the 15&quot; with Conti 205/65R15 reinforced sidewalls
and she rides better than ever and handling has improved immensly!  I
would suggest a wheel/tire upgrade for anyone who is not happy with the
performance and comfort of driving their van.....
These wheels require no machining and are rated to carry vanagon loads.
Not sure some of these other wheels that are being mentioned are....
