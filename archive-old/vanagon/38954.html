&gt;I was wondering how you can tell a good tranny from a bad one at a 
&gt;swap meet.  At the last meet I went to there were some all painted up 
&gt;purty and supposidly rebuilt.  Others were just pulled and their 
&gt;sellers calimed they were in good condition.  When people want cash 
&gt;only and you know you will never see them again, how do you protect  
&gt;yourself?

You are gambling. In general transmissions either work or not.  Although they
may get tired, the seller should know if it worked.  If the price is right
and you can do the instalation yourself or get it done cheaply, then this is
often the best way to go.  For example, if I can get a Jetta trans for 250,
I'll go for it.  I can't buy syncros and bearings for that money.  A few
hours to install it and if it last tweo years, I got my money's worth.  For
Vanagons, I'll often buy a trans just for parts. Especially Syncros.
