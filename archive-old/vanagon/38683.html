Subject: Dormobile Tops &amp; other junkyard finds

Call me weird, (it's happened before) but it seems to me that I replied to a
very similar post on this or the Vintagvw list about a year ago. Supposedly,
this yard also had a rare fiberglass boat top bus. I can't remember who was
going off on this...

Went to Alabama today to negotiate the price on a top off a '66
Dormobile to go on my '65 Sundial Camper.  The guy said it could 
be mine for $100.  Does this sound like a fair price?

I popped it up and there were no tears in the vinyl sides and 
there were no broken bows. &lt;snip&gt;
