Subject: [vanagon]  bench seat

I have the rear bench seat FS cheap, '87, blue/grey plaid panels.  VGC, no 
tears, no stains, very minimal wear. Will throw in the seat belts and all 
door/wall panels to match.  It folds flat , but not into a bed. Any takers?  
Shipping would be tricky, feel free to drop by... right after you pass the 
US east coast border :)   Tim Smith
