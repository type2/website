Subject:       '71 bus running too rich?

My '71 bus is running rich (black electrodes, tailpipe, bumper above 
tailpipe...).  According to St. Muir, my fix is to go with a smaller 
main jet.  Is there anything I can do that might be a little less 
drastic?  I'm running a stock Solex 34-3.  The throttle positioner is 
out of the loop (broken; vaccum lines are plugged) and I have a pair 
of sanobitchen &lt;grin&gt; 041 heads on the engine.  Anyone have any 
ideas?  Carbs have allways been somewhat of a mystery to me, and any 
enlightenment on adjustments would be GREATLY appreciated.

Thanks!
