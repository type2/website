 Anyone with an 87 vanagon with a/c that had the recall service
 performed--i.e. metal support brace added to ceiling piece so it doesn't
 fall down and konk someone on the head.  Is the new support visible? 
 What does it look like or is there no difference in appearance?
  &gt;&gt;
It is well hidden.
