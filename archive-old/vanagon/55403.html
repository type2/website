If you remove equal amounts of material from the sealing surface AND the
deck, would not the geometry remain the same?

&gt;I second the idea that there is no way to machine the heads. The

&gt;requires that the original surface be maintained.
&gt;
&gt;The reason for this is that the head is &quot;supported&quot; by the cylinders 
&gt;not
&gt;the gasket as in conventional engines.
&gt;
&gt;Removing any metal from the sealing surface of the head would make the
&gt;gasket seal much less reliable if not destroy it completely.
&gt;
&gt;As noted, filling the pits with JB Weld is a good solution. There are 
&gt;some
&gt;good directions for doing the job in the archives.
