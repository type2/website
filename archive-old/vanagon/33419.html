&gt; Subject: Slider handle (int.)

&gt; Why does this thing keep breaking? Can that stupid pot-metal
&gt; handle be repaired, or has someone figured out good
&gt; replacement (other than vice-grips)? Perhaps this is
&gt; Volkswagen's answer to the anti-child safety door in '84.

I have an '84 with the same problem.  I guess I should be
happy mine lasted as long as it did because I use the side
door as the *primary* entrance.  I hear that VW changed the
mechanism in '85 to make it easier to open (and therefore
less stress on the handle).  My solution to the handle
breakage was simple...pulled one off of a '67 and it screwed
right on.  Granted, the chrome doesn't go with the brown
interior, but it works.  Oldsplitanium wins out over
pot-metal every time!
