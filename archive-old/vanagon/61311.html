Thanks for the tip. I was going to get NFS2 anyway because I saw a Westy
amongst the 'traffic'. Actually being able to drive it is fantastic.

So I finally got Need For Speed 2 as a joint birthday present between my
son and me. It is really really good. Of course I tried the secret Vanagon
option straightaway. I also tried 'beetle', which did not work, then I
remembered that in the US they call it a bug. Sure enough typing in 'bug'
gave me a Beetle.

I would rate this as the best driving game I have ever come across. You can
even choose the colour of your VW. I chose a blue to match my 1984 GL and I
was shocked to see that it was authentic down to the chrome trims in the
window rubbers, chrome bumper with two rubber strips and also rusting faded
paint around the window areas! The Vanagon was slow but the Beetle was even
slower. I had no trouble not crashing it unlike the supercars. The engine
sounds were really authentic too.

As an added bonus you can choose one of about 8 supercars costing hundreds
of thousands!

&gt; If anyone has need for speed 2 you can drive the Vanagon Westy!  All you
=
&gt; do is go to the main setup screen and type &quot;vanagon&quot; then hit race.  It =
&gt; is REALLY slow, and the shift points are accurate, except that it has a =
&gt; 5 speed instead of a 4 speed, 1st gear shifts at 22mph just like mine!  =
&gt; It does cool burn outs too.  There are other cars that you can drive =
&gt; also.  To get all of the codes go to this page:
