Definitely NOT.  All of the articles referenced fires in non-fuel injected
upright engines.  Maximum pressure for the push-on type hose is about three
psi.  Fuel Injected systems run five times that and require high pressure
hoses with clamped or threaded fittings.

In fact, no modern vehicle uses clamped hoses in the pressurized part of the
fuel injection system.  If there is a hose it uses threaded, crimped-on
fittings.  All other pressurized fuel runs are via metal pipes, O-ringed
castings and so forth.  A glance at a modern American engine's FI system will
give you an immediate education in what VW is doing wrong in their FI
lash-up.

I'm sorry to have created confusion on this very important issue.  My lack of
experience on VW's FI systems colored my choice of words.  But the articles
remain valid regarding the bulkhead fitting and prevention of engine fires in
early-model Volkswagens.
