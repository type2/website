Subject:      F&amp;%$_at__at_!! Heater-Vanagon help


OK. My heater won't blow from the dash. It DOES heat esp if driving (the
faster, the more air flow from the heater) but it no longer blows variably by
using the control. My blower for the footwell in the back seat does work fine.
However, my knob that adjusts the blower has frozen wide open. Actually, the
only way you know it's wide open is because of the floor vent in back. Looking
at pages 82.10-82.11 in the Bently Cryptography, it looks like if I assume the
knob is now a separate problem, maybe I'm looking at a fuse, but I'll be
damned if I can find a blown fuse. Also, the knob to which I refer is #3, the
Temperature Regulating Switch. Could it be the Heater Relay Switch (#6 on page
82.10)? Anyone else ever have this problem?

BTW, from Joel's stats, I have:

1985 VW Vanagon GL Camper, beige, jump seat, born november 1994, cb, 2 belgian
sheepdog passengers in back, weirdo in loud clothes at the helm, colombian
queen riding shotgun
