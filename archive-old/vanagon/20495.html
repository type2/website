Well,

I was watching a video of the Apollo moon shot series the other day.

During a quick take to the crowds about JFK space center in florida,
they pan across a beach, and waht do you see??

About 30 pre-66 westies, tops popped, all facing the same direction!

Everyone was camping out, waiting for the rocket launch.

A sight to behold!
