&gt;3) Now bleed the next furthest brake from the reservoir (left rear).
&gt;Only bleed until the new fluid starts to flow i.e. clear and clean.

Here's something NOT to do:

Was bleeding the whole brake and clutch system a couple of years
ago. SO employed with pumping the pedal and refilling the reservoir.
I'm under opening and closing the nipples, and watching the
color change from brown and yucky to crystal clear new Castrol
GT-LMA. Clutch and rear brakes are done quickly. I'm under the 
front doing the passenger side brake, and after a LOOOOOOOOONG
time, and having almost filled up a quarter size glass bottle
with brown fluid I start wondering why I'm not seeing any
new clear fluid. SO reports we're almost running out of new fluid.

I get out from under the bus worried about what can be wrong.
Turns out SO switched to our second quart bottle of new GT-LMA,
and lo and behold the color of this one is not crystal clear like
the first one but BROWN!!! Duh! (Not dirty, just brown like some
brake fluids are, but after seeing one clear bottle I of course expected
them all to be clear)

transmission oil)
