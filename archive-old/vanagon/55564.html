Ahh, yes, the Classic Urban Legend;

1)  It happened to a friend of a friend...

      &quot;At a company where a friend of mine works, a co-worker of his
       received one of these calls&quot;

2)  It involved new (and untrusted technology)

      &quot;The company name that they give is usually a big well-known
       software company, and they usually say that they are doing the
       survey because they want to give out free software. They want
       to know what would be a good time for someone to come from their
       company and install the software on your PC at your home.&quot;

      &quot;they should have your address (we think they're getting it off
       the internet)&quot;

3)  It involves a fairly reasonable warning or moral message

      &quot;I want to make you all aware of the situation and the potential
       danger involved in giving out any information like this over the
       phone.&quot;

For further information, see any book by Jan Brunvald.

&gt;     &gt;Be aware.....
&gt;     &gt;
&gt;     &gt;
&gt;     &gt;
&gt;     &gt;There is a big scam going on where a person calls and says &gt;that they
&gt;     are doing a computer survey from a company.  The &gt;company name that
&gt;     they give is usually a big well-known &gt;software company, and they
&gt;     usually say that they are doing &gt;the survey because they want to give
&gt;     out free software. They &gt;want to know what would be a good time for
&gt;     someone to
&gt;     &gt;come from their company and install the software on your
&gt;     &gt;PC at your home.  They also ask questions about income, etc. &gt;&gt;
&gt;     &gt;During their questioning, they find out what time you're &gt;usually
&gt;     home, what kind of computer equipment you have and &gt;all sorts of other
&gt;     valuable information.  At a company where a &gt;friend of mine works, a
&gt;     co-worker of his received one of &gt;these calls, and he was robbed the
&gt;     very next day (of course, &gt;when he was not home).
&gt;     &gt;&gt;
&gt;     &gt;I received a similar call yesterday afternoon. Fortunately, I &gt;knew
&gt;     about this ahead of time, and we didn't provide them with &gt;any
&gt;     information.
&gt;     &gt;&gt;
&gt;     &gt;I want to make you all aware of the situation and the &gt;potential
&gt;     danger involved in giving out any information like &gt;this over the
&gt;     phone.  The people sound very genuine, and &gt;very few people are going
&gt;     to question receiving free &gt;software.  I would advise you, however, to
&gt;     tell the people &gt;that if they have your phone number, they should have
&gt;     your &gt;address (we think they're getting it off the internet), and
&gt;     &gt;they can mail you any free software they might be offering. &gt;You may
&gt;     even want to tell them you don't have a home &gt;computer. Whatever
&gt;     you're comfortable with.  Please don't &gt;give out any information that
&gt;     you may regret later. Pass &gt;this information along to friends and
&gt;     family members, as &gt;well.  The fewer people they are able to scam, the
&gt;     better.
