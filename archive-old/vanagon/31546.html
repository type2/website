My brother (gjander_at_warren.med.harvard_dot_edu) is a recently declared
wanabus.  As he is a bit shy, he asked me to ask you guys what models
would be most suitable for a trip through Mexico and central America.
I.e. we are looking at issues of reliability and availablility of parts
in those areas.

Also, if anyone knows of a suitable vehicle available near boston,
please let him know.

Happy new year, all,

Albrecht
