Howdy!

	Last night, I rebuilt a 28 PICT-1 carb a friend of mine gave
me.  It was working on his bus, but I rebuilt it before I stuck it in
mine.

	The problem I'm having (I think) is getting the mixture right.
I putzed around with the screw on the left side of the carb for a while
(RIR) and although it started right up, it kinda ran rough and I was
getting black soot out the exhaust.

	I had it so it would idle well, but taking off I had no power until 
I got going pretty good, and then it was like a bat outa hell.  I turned
the screw out some, which seemed to improve the lowe end, but the high and
mid parts kinda pooped out.  I settled on turning it almost all the way in,
and it seems OK, but now I'm not really impressed with the performance.

	Any ideas on how I should set this baby up?  I lent out my Idiot Guide...

	My old carb had this weird problem of gas in the vaccum line.  WHen 
changed distributors a while back, the diaphram was _full_ of gas!  Good
thing I didn't have a hole in it!

	I have another carb I'm gonna rebuild, that I got at the junkyard, but
I noticed that it has a lot of play in the throttle shaft, so I may 
finish it and pawn it off on someone else....
