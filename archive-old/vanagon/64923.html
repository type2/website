&lt;&lt; Some scum sucking %$#%$#%$%$%$%$$$%%%% stole, torched and put our TRISTAR
 over a cliff yesterday. Wife had it down the local shopping centre came
 out and it was gone. Insurance wanker said lucky it was is insured and
 they will pay up - how do we find a replacement - anyone got a TRISTAR
 for sale? Have to go and cry myself to sleep now. &gt;&gt;

and beat the remnants up w/ a sledgehammer!!
