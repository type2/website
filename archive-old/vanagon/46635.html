Subject: Tire Question

        As I will be getting new tires for the front next week I just
wondered if anyone knew anything about the Michelin Kevlers? The are on
sale right now at Tire Warehouse here in Edmonton for $69.00/each
(installed and balanced), and were regularly $108. It seems like a great
deal , and they have them in my (or should I say 'our' size which is 185 R
14).

        And if anyone can suggest something equally good yet still
relatively inexpensive I would be much obliged. I do realize that my life
is riding on these things, but at the same time I only have a certain
amount of money to spend. Its kinda like how I buy generic Noodles and
Cheese instead of the good Kraft stuff.  :)

TIA
mike
