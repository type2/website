Well, I leave for Mass. from San Francisco on Wed. and was looking at
getting some last minute tips for my Westy...

It's a 77 (78 engine) that recently had new P's &amp; C's, and rebuilt Mark
Stephens heads. I've put about 1000 miles on it since then and was
considering switching to Synthetic. I have no oil leaks at all, and in
those 1000 miles it used about a half quart of 30 weight. I was thinking
the synthetic might give slightly lower temps. Any answers to that? And it
would be less likely to break down in the higher temp range?

I plan on doing 60 or so to keep the temps down. At what temps should I
pull over and let it cool? I don't have the time or money right now to add
an outside oil cooler. I think I might drive at night mostly to keep it
cool, but drive during the day coming back since I'll be with my brother
and we're going to do alot of stopping and sightseeing.

So any and all advice appreciated as to what I should bring and look out
for driving this thing 7000 miles in 3 weeks. Wish me luck!   Tom

P.S.- Oh yeah, on the way back we'll be towing a small 4 x 8 utility
trailer containing his stuff. Nothing heavy, mainly stereo stuff, TV,
etc...anything to look out for towing this?  Thanks

&quot;So you're going to take us for a ride eh?&quot;
&quot;Yeah, come on&quot;
&quot;Well I don't have a sister!&quot;
&quot;That's ok we no gotta car!&quot;
