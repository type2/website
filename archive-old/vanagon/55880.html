Subject: Re: engine running too cold

&gt; 
&gt; my 90 carat runs too cold.  On days when the temp. outside goes below freezing, 
&gt; the beast will operate correctly and warm up is normal.  However, while 
&gt; cruising _at_ 65 mph the engine will cool dramatically and actually fool the 
&gt; engine to go into a cold start senario. the result is a mixture rich enough to 
&gt; force a pull over to allow the engine to heat up agian. T-Stat Right?  Nope. 
&gt; The new Thermstat failed to correct the problem. obviously over heating has 
&gt; never been a problem even while pulling a 67 beetle in august with the AC on 
&gt; and a small pit crew aboard.  Any Ideas?  Thanks.
&gt; 
Another listee mentioned certain brands of t-stats which had weak 
springs, causing them to stay open too long at high rpm. (65mpg = 
~3500 rpm....) 
What brand did you use?
