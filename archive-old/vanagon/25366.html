Subject: A crazy idea: put AFC injection on my 71.

What is the concensus here?

Me thinks:
Advantages
Better mileage.
More HP.
More reliable, wouldn't have to search for good, German 34-pict3's.
Won't have to adjust my old junky 34-pict-3's every month.
All of the parts would be on a 75- bug engine.
Something which is neat and nobody else has.

Disadvantages:
Expensive (and how).
Time and labor to set up.
Will it even work?

Well, I have a late model bug in the area which might have FI, so parts 
might not be a problem.  I also know where there is a 74 bus with FI, so I 
could get a gas tank with the fuel return fitting for the bus.  I am really 
not a FI type, but I am being persuaded by a guy with a 72 T3.  It seems to 
run real well.  I guess the idea was sparked here.  VW got a good bit of HP 
out of the T3's with the older system.  I was wondering if the AFC system 
was all that good as well.  This should be the same system which is on all 
the T4 engines, i.e. 74 on, right?  I know that some of the parts are 
different, like the ECU and the injectors, but the principles are the same.  
I guess that the other question is will all of this fit in the engine 
compartment of my bus?  I was looking at a picture in &quot;Fix your Volkswagen&quot;, 
and it looks tight in the top side of the engine.  

All of this really hinges on finding a junked donor vehicle.  Just having to 
buy one of the parts new would really set me back.  It seems that futting FI 
on a VW engine is taking another of those steps which will allow it to be 
real reliable and trouble free.  Or is it?
