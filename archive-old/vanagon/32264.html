Wasserboxers:

Don't let the ASCII art scare you, it's just a poor
representation of the heater cable plate graphics.  The air
cooled folk seem to think that once you're cooking with
water, all your heating problems are over.  Actually, it
just means it's time to figure out what four dots is the
international symbol for.

Mark McCulley (aka raven) was asking about fresh air.  Steve
has had limited, low tech success with some mods.  So I
offer the following bits of information for review and
laughter.  First the easy ones.

Lever 2 opens/shuts the water valve to the heater core(s).
All the way left is shut.  All the way right is open.

Lever 4 is to control the direction of the fresh air.
Apparently four dots is the international (VW) symbol for
the four vents in the ceiling.  When Lever 4 is to the left,
fresh air is directed to the ceiling vents.  When Lever 4 is
to the right, fresh air is directed to the front heater core
box.  Apparently there is no way to completely stop this
fresh air from entering, short of physically blocking it at
the source.  I'm sure this is some crazy safety issue.

Lever 1 is for defrosting, as witnessed by my (poor)
imitation of a windshield on the right.  When Lever 1
is right, air flow is to the windshield.  When Lever 1 is
to the left, I assume it goes wherever it can,
possibly as determined by Lever 3.

Lever 3 is the most confusing.  My &quot;V&quot; symbol is
really a little triangle in a box.  Maybe it's a
down-arrow.

When it's cold outside, I use the following approach.

For *STARTUP*, 1 and 3 to the right to force all air to
windshield (and off of my feet).  2 to the left to close the
valve and let the engine warm up faster.  4 to the left.

ONCE WARM, (when the temperature needle is up to the second
mark) I reverse all four positions.  1 and 3 to the left
push heat to my feet. 2 to the right opens the valve and
lets the hot water to the core.  4 to the right to close the
ceiling vents.  And, I finally turn on the fan.

If you're still reading this, you must already know that the
fresh air vents at both extremes of the dash must be closed
during all of this.

Now, does anyone know anything about the (rarely used)
little sliding vents in the doors?

Toasty, but confused,
