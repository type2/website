Subject: FF: Buses for Everyone!

Just spent the last two days cleaning out the garage in anticipation of my
new bus from Bob Hufford. You'll all notice that we haven't heard from Bob
in two days. I'm pretty sure that's because he did win the lottery and
he's been tied down with the lawyers and such, making sure he can get
enough money together to buy us all busses in the first year. You know,
they always try to spread the cash out over 20 years so they can make the
interest on the money. That will leave Bob with a dinky $2.75 million 
this year...barely enough money to finish Rusty's Resto ;).

Well, I'm looking into a sweet '53 Camper Deluxe (small pop top with
tinted skylights all around). It has been converted to a Porsche
six-cylinder and has the camper interior, safari windows, etc. The body
has no rust and original paint. The guy found it in a barn a couple years
ago where it had been parked and covered since the original owner died in
1954. He wants $2500 for it but he'll throw in the original, working
engine (which only had 3400 miles on it) and spare window seals. I'm hoping 
Bob will spring for the full amount. 

Happy Friday! Hope you all have your eyes on a new bus! 8) Joe
