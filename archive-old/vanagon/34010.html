I didn't want to paint it the original Coral Red/Poop Brown.  His reaction
was along the same lines as if I'd told him I was going to cut the
roof off, lower it, and then turn it into a &quot;shortie.&quot;  I want to paint
it the early 2-tone green, its a light green on the bottom and a dark green
on top (I have a picture I'll put on my web page) and he thinks I stark

sounds like your friend is what is known in some circles as a &quot;Vintage
Pervert&quot;
one of those people who gets all excited over original buses, knows and cares
about true to year and model pieces  and colours, has memorized, or wants to,
the entire Parts List,  etc etc.  Will go to the VW museum and notice the
wrong parts on the cars in it (yes, really - the curator types are not VPs).
 Often anything later than 67 is not a 'real Volkwagen&quot; and dont even mention
water cooled!

funny enough, a lot of these people dont have old vws as their daily driver,
but a subaru or ford.

Its a lot easier to find a customized bus than an original one.  In fact it's
really rare to find one.   And a lot of the time, OEM and NOS parts ARE
better.  Sometimes NOS is gNarley Old S$%#.   Im really disappointed with
repro rubber, and in a rainy place window seals are crucial.   Peaple say
that German mufflers are higher quality   Repro safaris are notoriously bad.
 I really enjoy Vintage Meet in Seattle.   The other shows around here have
these lame buses, but not as bad as california.  So Kewel, lowered neon green
21 window with chrome chrome chrome.   Those people tend to have, IMHO, bad
attitudes.  I was also pleased to note that the bikini contest at the Bug In
died, as no one entered.  (I thought of entering in greasy overalls)  I'm
also thinking of getting my bug painted red, then putting black spots on it
 :)

But whats important is enjoying your vw

by the way, that's &quot;Sealing Wax Red/Chestnut Brown&quot;



(don't you all know what sealing wax is?  It's what you put all over your
restored vw to preserve it forever.)
