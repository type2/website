Subject: Bus gurus needed


Got a lead on a 67 camper (not pop top). The guy seemed kind of bummed.
Knows nothing about VWs, bought it from a friend who was in a bind. Now he
thinks he got a lemon 'cause the bus may need a clutch. I had stopped in
to see if it was for sale and by the time I left it was ;) but we didn't talk
$$.

I looked it over from the outside yesterday and with the exception of
some mid-west metal rot in some areas along the bottom it is straight
as can be. The owner says the inside is the best part. But it was locked
up at a different location and the bus window curtains were drawn so I
couldn't judge for myself.

I have no experience with buses either. I need a bus guy/gal to contact
me directly and give me some key tips on what is a critical rust problem
and what I can live with or is an easy fix.

Is Rusty Von Bondo still on the list?  Thom Fitz ?
