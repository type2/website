Subject: Back home, back on the list and an airbox Q:.

Hello everyone,
        I finally made it back from school and put about1500 miles on my bus
coming home and vacationing for a week.  I am using my parents email account
at home.  Currently I am trying to scrounge up enough money to put my bus in
for the 30,000 mi treatment.  I finally found a job so, that should come
soon enough.

        A question for a friend.  My good friend also has a 1985 vanagon
which just had a tranny rebuild and new heads/gaskets done.  The problem
that just popped up is the van is sputtering/bucking in the 1000 to 2000 rpm
range.  The shop said it was the air box so we took it home and threw my
airbox in, no change.
        What probably went wrong is the fact that i dont know what an airbox
is, just to check, is it the sealed box which is right after the air filter
housing?  If it is i undid the screw clamp and the flip clamps on the air
filter and put mine in her van, same problem was there.

        I hope everyone's summer is going great and drive safely.
