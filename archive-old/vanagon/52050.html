     Hi All,
     
       The phone number for Type II Enterprises listed in some information 
     I received from a list member did not work.  The incorrect number 
     listed is 714-895-1164.  What is the correct number?
       Moreover, The person I got when I called the incorrect number seemed 
     like she got a lot of them.  Can someone search the Faqs list to see 
     if the incorrect number is listed and remove it so we can save this 
     woman some aggravation
     
     
     Vince,
     '85 VW GL Westy (My girlfriend wanted me to mention that she is half   
                      owner of this vehicle)
     '90 Mit. Eclipse GSX
