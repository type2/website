Bruce,
I've owned 2 '93 Eurovan MV's, one I bought new, the other used. The new
one I bought was a reliability nightmare. The battery and fuel pump
stranded me twice, rear AC went out,surging engine,bad paint,etc. What
caused me to get rid of it however was the inept VW service dept. They
caused half the problems. VW bought the van back from me. I must say
they treated me very well(VW not the dealership). What caused me to buy
another one? The Ford Aerostar(my first and last non-VW) was an even
worse nightmare. At least I liked driving the Eurovan. After talking to
other Eurovan owners  I decided I had a lemon. This isn't to say they
don't have their problems. AC electrical problems and poor paint is a
recurring theme. My second one now has 96,000 miles on it and that
engine runs like it was brand new. I truly expect to get at least
160,000 miles out of it. The previous owner did have AC problems. Twice
it was a relay($50) and the last time it was the rear control valve
relay. I have noticed the paint on this one is excellant. It's Carribean
Teal which is a non-clearcoat. My first van was a blue clearcoat which
didn't seem to be as durable and had numerous flaws.

&gt;I'm an unhappy Eurovan owner!  I'vew owned a VW since I was 16!
&gt;But buying a 93 Eurovan ranks #1 in mistakes I've made thus far.  It's
&gt;been a nightmare.  What do you know about these vans?
&gt;
&gt;Here's a list of problems I've had:
&gt;A/C blew up twice
&gt;Rear A/C replaced twice
&gt;Headlights collect water (replaced 3x)
&gt;Body panels rusting at the seams (painted 2x)
&gt;Paint peeling off (gettting ready to paint again)
&gt;Side window decals &quot;balling up&quot; (replaced twice then repainted &quot;dull
&gt;black&quot;
&gt;A/C makes a &quot;wheezing noise&quot; (usually before it BLOWS UP)
&gt;
&gt;I should've pursued the lemon law on this one....oh well!
&gt;
&gt;Any advice or similar stories?
&gt;
&gt;Regards,
