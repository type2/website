Subject: Re: Paint removal-Best way?

i've heard people talking about 'media' blasting.  Instead of using sand,
which can eat the good metal,  using 'agricultural media', a fancy term for
walnut shells, which gets the rust, but is easier on the metal.

sanding sanding sanding - how tedious.  There is a reason god created
electricity.
