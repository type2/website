Subject: Re: Transporter Ute

a Ute is short for &quot;Utility Vehicle&quot;. The vehicle is a cross between a car
and a truck, sort of the precursor to Chevy S-10's and Ford Rangers. The
vehicle is basically a mid to full sized sedan, except behinf the front
seat, a pickup truck bed has been added, and the rear passenger sear
removed. Most &quot;utes&quot; would be very similar to an El Camino or a Ford
Ranchero. Remeber those beasts from the 70's?



&gt;And what, praytell, is a UTE?
&gt;To us North Americans, it is a native tribe,
&gt;and somehow I don't think that's what is meant here...
