Subject: '85 Cluster

Listies,

Here is my situation, hopefully I can get some insight from some other 
members.  I have a dying engine in my '85, as well as a stuffed-up cat 
(converter, not pet.)  As we all know, I'm looking at big bucks here - 
Please no flames from the aircoolies.

$2400 Longblock
$750 Labor
$800 Cat. Convert.
------------------
$3950 (plus other extras probably)

Which option do I take.

A) KEP Subaru Conversion Kit, (if it ever passes emissions)

B)Above New Parts Route

C) Used Complete 2.1 from newer vanagon/with full exhaust system, FI 
system

D) Sell for parts, use money to create &quot;I was waterfooled&quot; foundation, 
serving the interest of prospective wasserboxer owners.
