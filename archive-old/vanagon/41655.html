&gt;Hey, I was wondering that myself.  When I bought my '71, nothing was hooked
&gt;up to it either.  I just plugged it so that air that might be used for
&gt;cooling wasn't being released from it, but I'm kind of curious.
&gt;
&gt;

That 1/2 inch pipe on top of the fan shroud is used to assist puging the
fumes from the carbon canister.  The other end of the canister eventually
goes back to the air cleaner so the fumes can be burned off.  I believe this
was used on all 71+ bugs and buses.
