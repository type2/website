&quot;Driving home on a sunny day (actually yesterday), the turn
signal/flasher relay began making an awful lot of noise.  It was a hight
pitched buzzing and some clicking in there.  Well, I figured that the
relay just died on me and I needed a new one.

So went to the FLAPS and got one.  Unfortunately, it didn't fix the
problem which is still pretty much the same today.

Symptoms:
When the turn singal lever is moved to the on position (doesn't matter
which side), the relay clicks on, the indicator light lights up and stay
steadily lit, and the outside lights do not come on.  When the lever is
moved back to the off position, the indicator light goes out, the relay
emits a high-pitched buzz for a second or two and then clicks off.

When the hazard flasher switch is pulled, I hear a click but there are
no visible signs of activity.  The indicator light in the dash does not
come on, and neither does the red one in the switch.  Also none of the
outside lights come on.  This is an improvement as doing this yesterday
caused the fuse to blow.

you dont mention the year of your bus (Please, guys),  but i'd check all the
light bulbs.  i know this sounds dumb but i have this little memoory saying
if a bulb burns out it affects all the other functions routed through the
flasher box
