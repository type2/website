&gt;   Very interesting Robert.  I've been interested to hear a report from
&gt; someone who's dumped substantial engine heat this way.  Your oil cooler's
&gt; location makes it especially subject to becoming covered with mud or, if
&gt; oily, oil soaked dust.  Have you experienced much of this kind of fowling?

	I expected it to get covered with mud and dust too, bu it dosent seem to.  About 
once a month in the summer I hose the cooler off with a high pressure washer, but it 
dosent seem too necessary, the cooler stays pretty clean.
	I would recomend looking at the spot you have in mind for your cooler before 
installing the cooler.  Is it relativly clean(I don't mean spotless I just mean no caked 
on mud and crud)?  If so, anything you put there will probably look the same as that 
spot in a year.
