Subject: Books: Another Bentley Lift

Derek's message reminded me about a set of books I got with my bus (Clymer
Publications). These include wiring diagrams, etc. just like those seen in
Bentley. They're not as good as Bentley in some respects, but better in
some areas. Lots of pictures, details missing from Bentley in some cases
(e.g., includes text and pictures about backup light fuse in uprights...so
THAT's why I don't have backup lights.) Good series to watch for at yard
sales and used book stores. Probably would go cheap. 8) Joe
