&gt; Here's an interesting 'for sale' from the local paper;
&gt; 
&gt; Mercedes 207D (Westfalia camper), 1984, 5 Spd., 40K Kms, 7 pass, 
&gt; sleeps 4 adults, exc. cond.  Never winter driven, very rare. $42,900 
&gt; neg.  (514)-533-5535
&gt; 
&gt; Now I wonder, did Westfalia convert this like a standard VW 
&gt; Westfalia?  Has anyone seem one of these things?

Westfalia makes campers on Mercedes and Ford chassis's. Maybe other 
vehicles. I think that's been true for many years. Also, for a very long 
time (perhaps explaining their horse logo), they've made horse trailers. 
I've heard these are highest quality.
