&gt; &gt;         I personally don't like the pancake heaters, they are huge, and the 
&gt; &gt; massive surface area coupled with air flow/slush etc under the van means 
&gt; &gt; that they lose most of their heat before it even gets to the inside. It was 
&gt; &gt; a half-assed solution to getting extra heat to the defrosters for stop and 
&gt; &gt; go traffic and during warmup. Lousy altogether for camping.
&gt; 
&gt; My '79 has a steel plate under the belly, which protects the heater from the
&gt; elements.  The plate covers the area between the parallel chassis bars, and
&gt; runs the length of the center floor area.  You might try to find one of these
&gt; to keep salt and crud from destroying your heater.
&gt; 
&gt; My heater really puts out the heat.  It's a 6500W Bosch unit.  If only it
&gt; wasn't so smoky. :-(.  Works fine when you're parked, as well.  Just turn on 
&gt; the timer before you head out for the morning commute.

I believe I have the same unit, but I'm not sure. The vanagon factory 
manual has oodles of pages on troubleshooting these units, if you don't 
have one it may be worth beg, borrowing or stealing one to help cure the 
smoke problem... (heater exhaust entering the intake possibly?)
