Subject: 21 window 


the scoop as i know it is that he bought it from 
its 2nd owner.  the paint is rough, its got a little
rust but it is solid, he mentioned some under
the front driver side window rubber.  its got a knock
in the front driver side which resembles an inverted
hub cap kindof dent.  he intends to push that out.

two full width seats in back, with the middle seat 
equipped with a flip down back in the position near
the doors. its got a new exhaust system he put on 
yesterday, and he drove it on a 400 round trip
journey from raleigh to va beach this past weekend.

he bought it two weeks ago from the garage owner
who was moving to florida, i think. 

i don't know about the tires, or mileage, the interior
is clean although not restored. oh, and its got the 
big rag top which he replaced last week after the
original blew off while he was driving it home after
buying it.  with the top open its like a big old
peanut hopper.  

a very cool bus,  he didn't give me a price for it, 
as i mentioned, he hopes to get that early westie.
find the poor guy a westie will ya???
