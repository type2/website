&gt; ok, gang ... see what you think is missing (needs to be added) or is just
&gt; flat wrong (needs to be fixed).
&gt; 
&gt; Dictionary of Terms          from the Bus/Vanagon List
[...]
&gt; BRICK       1. Vanagon model Transporters.  2. any VW Bus or Transporter
I for one don't like this one. Where I come from, a brick is a
'60s era International Scout. I might be a little out of touch
with recent usage, however....
[...]
&gt; CV-JOINT    one of the small circular devices at an end of an axle on
&gt;             a bus. Microbuses have only two of these, Buses, Vanagons,
&gt;             and Eurovans have four, while Syncros have eight. these
&gt;             are necessary to allow the axle to move up and down while
&gt;             still turning to propel the car. the joints need to be
&gt;             keep greased to function properly. when they are worn, they
&gt;             make a knocking-noise that strikes fear into the hearts of
&gt;             bus owners everywhere.
Swing-axle VWs don't have CV joints. They have boots at the rear
which may look like a CV boot, but the stuff inside is different.
[...]
&gt; KOMBI       generally accepted to mean a mid-range trim model of a
&gt;             Volkswagen Transporter. that is, NOT a utility/commercial
&gt;             truck, and yet NOT a Deluxe model with all the bells and
&gt;             whistles of luxury and convenience. usually, a Kombi has
&gt;             windows along the side, seats, and some side paneling.
You might get some discussion on this.  General usage is probably 
a pre-68 with three windows on each side, regardless of the interior
appointments.
[...]
&gt; SPLIT       the Microbus, made from 1949 to 1967. also called a
&gt;             Split-Window.
I don't like referring to pre-68's as split-windows, because of
the confusion with the bugs with the split back windows.

[...]
&gt; TRANSPORTER any of Volkswagen smaller trucks and vans. known as Type 2,
&gt;             they evolved through four (4) 'generations': T1, T2, T3, and
&gt;             T4. but the entire line of vehicles has always been called
&gt;             'Type 2'.
Is this generally accepted? I've never heard of a type 3 type II.
[...]

BTW--did anyone call them Westphalias before the Vanagon era,
when they emblazoned them up on the front of the fiberglas?
I don't remember that term used in period....

All opinions are those of a middle-aged fart from the Southwest
who has been with the VW bug for about 25 years....
