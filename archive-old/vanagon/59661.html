&gt; Greetings,
&gt; 
&gt; Just purchased my first vanagon, an 87 westie synchro.  I Have a few
&gt; questions:

Congratulations!!

&gt; &lt;SNIP&gt;
&gt; 3.  Where can I find the EPA emissions label?  I bought it out of CA
&gt;     (where i live) and am trying to find if it was ever certified for CA
&gt;     emissions (will save me $300).

Pull down the rear license plate door (where, conveniently, you can
check/add coolant and oil).  The sticker should be there.  And, I
believe I read somewhere that all 87's met CA EPA stuff and said so on
the label (I know mine does and it's lived it's whole life in
Louisiana).
