Subject: Last Sunday's North Houston VW Club's show

Just a quick round-up of last weekend's Bug Splash 7...

Not being a veteran of many VW car shows, or even car shows of any
sort, I had a hard time wiping the grin off my face as I walked from
one car to the next.  People must have thought I was balmy.  Saw all
sorts splitties, barndoors, breadloaves, Westies, and yes, even a couple
of Vanagons (one was water-cooled, can't remember the other); not to
mention a large assortment of bugs and bug derivatives.  Not much in the
swap part of the meet, though.

The absolute jewel of the show was a 66 bug that was entirely original
equipment!  The guy bought it off his in-laws and it has only 5900 miles
on the clock.  Even has the original tires on it (yikes!)  

You know, you think that a 30 year old car is old, but that makes it
only 12 years older than my 78 Scirocco...does that mean that my
beloved Scirocco is heading toward middle age?  Sniff.

A few cars were for sale...the going asking price seemed to be $5000.
Too rich for me.  Unless of course that 66 were for sale...  

Even saw that one of our venerable list members was a member of a local
club.  None other than Unca Joel, even though Alybamy must be at least
800 miles away!  Small world.

Gotta go,
Joachim (who is still smiling like a mug)
