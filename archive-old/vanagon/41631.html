Subject: Head corrosion

Mike West wrote about the idea of neutralizing any electrical imbalace between the head and 
cylinder body to prevent head corrosion.  A shop here in Seattle, Connecting Rod Inc. (I think 
that is the name)claims that they do this on all their rebuilt enginges with success.  Has anyone 
out there had any experience with them??  Long term, did this help??
