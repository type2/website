&lt;&lt;Hi: Sounds like the 2nd gear slider. You need a rebuild. I had mine done
for about 900$ with all new German bearings and wear parts.&gt;&gt;

Hey Todd,

Who did you have do the work?
My clutch, which is original, is starting to slip badly
dealer estimates were around $800-$900, Precision Auto $500-$600.
Any thoughts?

BTW I've got some pictures of my van at the Oregon coast if anyone is
interested.
