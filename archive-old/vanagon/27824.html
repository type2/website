Subject: Re: WTB: clock for breadloaf (or a tach)
Date: Tue, 31 Oct 95 21:00:28 EST

&gt;   I thought about putting a tach there, but I've decided that a clock
&gt;   would provide more useful information - besides, the engine gives an
&gt;   AUDIBLE report on it's activity on a continuous basis.

Bah, I always coveted one of these till I finally got one in the '78
then realized that there was no way I could sleep in the Bus with the
damn thing ticking.  May just be me though, I got to have quiet, of
course so does my SO so I took mine out and put it in the parents,
installed an old radio with a digital clock I had about.  But on the
other subject, I would sort of like a tach for the hell of it, does
anyone know of one that will fit the opening nicely?
