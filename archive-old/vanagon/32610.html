Subject: Texas camping-repost

Hey now,
        Just want to make sure no-one missed this when I posted earlier
this week. If anyone's interested, just meet us up at the lake, we're in
the primered '70 transporter w/ the cocker spaniel.


INCLUDED MESSAGE:
Hey now,
        Seems that the weather will be warming up this weekend. With that
in mind, myself and the S.O. are gonna head for the hills, for some fishing
and possibally canoeing(if we can afford a rental). Inks lake state park is
the destination. It's up around Burnet, TX-about 1 to 1.5 hrs from Austin.
If anyone wants to join, come on along. Drop me a line if you want more
info.

Peace,
