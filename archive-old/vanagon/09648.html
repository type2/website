Subject: Porsche 6 in late bus
Date: Tue, 10 Jan 1995 16:52:10 -0600 (CST)

If I remember correctly, Bill Kennedy once mentioned that some Porsche
engines are too tall to fit into a vanagon without removing the lid
over the engine compartment and building a box. Such a modification,
however, is no longer needed if one uses a 3.2 liter or later Porsche 6.

It now occurs to me that Bill probably said that with reference to the
80-91 vanagons. The late (68-79) busses have a much higher engine
compartment, so maybe on older (and hence cheaper) Porsche 6 would fit
without such a change? Is this correct?

Thanks

(Bill: I misplaced your e-mail address, so I sent this question to the
whole list, thinking that others might also be interested. Sorry.)
