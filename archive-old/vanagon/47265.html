&gt; musty (pretty gross) smell.  Is there the &quot;wonder cleaner&quot; out there that I'm
&gt; missing?

    Working in a repair shop we have our share of tracking dirt and 
grime in and onto peoples carpet occasionally,  what I've found that 
works very well is Resolve.  Check it out it's worth trying once!
