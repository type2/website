&gt; How do you know that it is running hot, anyway?  Touching the dipstick?  Or
&gt; do you have oil temp and cylinder head temp gauges?  If so, is it the oil
&gt; or heads that are too hot?
&gt; 

Hmm... Actually, that's a good question. I guess I was relating the
smoking to mean it was running hot. Are bus engines supposed to run hotter
anyway? (than bug engines?) Also, supposeing I wanted to pull the flaps
off and see what that helps. Would I be removing the long rod that is
connected to the thermostat wire?? I've got still more engine cleaning to
do on the engine - I found more oil INSIDE the fan housing.. It spilled
there when the seal blew.....

Thanks!!
