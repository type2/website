&gt;&gt;This might seem like no news to you west coasters, but this is the first
&gt;&gt;Vanagon with square headlights in the Philly, Atlantic city, New York
&gt;&gt;area.

I'm out here Near Valley Forge PA and I see at least one late model Vanagon 
daily.   Now, split windows, that's another story, I think I saw one last 
March....
