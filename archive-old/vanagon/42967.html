Subject: Re: about &quot;Under the Bus&quot;

hmm.. i wonder if i could put hinges on my baywindow...and somesorta 
holdupholdown item too...&lt;i have considered making the rear window of my 
74 super a hatch for some time now, just for ease of getting stuff out from 
behind back seat..&gt;

&lt;thinking! since i haveto do major work ANYway to this thing..&gt;

or would it put undo stresses on the winsheild? &lt;then epoxy supports on 
it....&gt;


ok! i gotta STOP thinking here..
