&gt; 
&gt; 	So I am trying to buy a '71 bus. It is missing the camper top and 
&gt; there is a 3 X 3 foot &quot;hole&quot; in the roof. My question is, can I take the 
&gt; camper top off a '73 or '79 and fit to the '71? It looks like it wouldn't 
&gt; a problem but I have seen the small pop-up tops and am wondering if this 
&gt; is what I need to get. Thanks. I need to act fast because this kind of 
&gt; hardware dissapears as fast as the busses do!
&gt; 
The small square pop-tops were only used until '67. After that, from
'68-'73, the tops hinged from the front, and had a small cot up top.
&gt;From '74 on, the top hinged from the rear, and had a folding double bed
on the roof. I would try for one of the later models if you can get one,
but any of those years will fit. (I have a '70 top on a '78 bus)
