Subject: Re: why we do it  (long)

          oh, i don't know why i'm picking up this thread except that
          like dave easterwood says &quot;it's a hippy karma thing&quot;.

          Bravo, Dave!!  of course we help people when we can and when
          it doesn't get in the way of our own important projects or
          family life, job, etc.   if we did wrenching for a living,
          it would probably be a different story and rightly so.  but
          we don't.  althought i'm not even sure about that last
          statement.  my motorcycle dealer works 60 hours plus at his
          trade but often comes over to the house on weekends to see
          how i'm doing when i'm working on my bike.  sometimes he
          gets in there and gets dirty with me, sometimes he drinks my
          beer and talks me through it.  same thing with my friend who
          works on vw's as a part time job.  i teach and you can often
          find me in my lab at night or on weekends doing workshops,
          special sessions for my students and sometimes their
          friends.  because it's what i like to do.  i have no desire
          to keep my knowledge secret or always get monetary
          compensation for it.  there are many forms of compensation.
           you all know this from your own experience but we all need
          to be reminded from time to time so we don't get like
          scrooge and lose our soulfulness.  my wife and i took all
          our spares to the NEATO tampa meet last month in hopes of
          selling/trading them for stuff we needed/wanted.  we sold a
          few nice items at very low prices to people who were
          actually installing them to their vehicles on the premises,
          that was a thrill to see.  at the end of the day we had many
          items left and since we were determined not to take them
          home with us we walked the grounds looking for vehicles that
          needed these exact parts and then handing them over to
          surprised but pleased bus owners.  it was like playing santa
          and felt very good.  we got some heartfelt handshakes and
          even a couple hugs.  made the day well worth the trip.  i
          know dave to be a generous.  many times we've exchanged
          goodies and knowledge with no expectations from each other
          than appreciation.  if we didn't all feel this way to some
          degree, the list wouldn't exist either.  that's what we do
          and why we do it.  now, i'm down off the box and feeling
          groovy.  hope it lasts a while.
