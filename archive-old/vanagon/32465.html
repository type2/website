Hello all,
What are recommended spares to carry around that are vw specific.  My 87 
syncro is pushing 135kmi and I'd like to put together an emergency kit so's 
my chances of being stranded are reduced.  some ideas i've had (with the 
help of previous browsing of the list) are:

starter relay (what other relays or electrical components should be incl.)
a section of coolant hose and some couplings
belts
coolant
????

==========================

   fuel pump relay
   main relay
   fuses
   hose clamps
   duct tape
   distrubutor rotor
   brake light/turn signal  bulbs
   throttle cable
   voltage regulaor w/brushes for alternator
   handful of assorted METRIC nuts and bolts
   main headlamp bulb
   water (potable, just in case)
   a quart or two of oil, crankcase
   blanket
   a cheap set of metric wrenches and sockets (they only have to work one
time!!)
   Phillips head screwdrivers
   Metric allen wrenches
   fuel filter
   Optional, spare fuel pump (the electric Bosch pumps for FI systems are not
always readily available and are expensive )
   fuel pressure regulator
   lenghts of vacume and FI (high pressure)  fuel hose
   fire extingusher
   first aid kit
   Bentley Manual
   test lamp or meter
   coil of electrical wire and tape.

change belts and hoses as preventative maintenance, throw the old ones (still
good) in the car as &quot;get me home&quot; spares.

Some of these spares you may not want to put on yourself, you may have access
to a mechanic, but if it is Sunday eveing out in the boonies, you still need
the parts!

Harvey
