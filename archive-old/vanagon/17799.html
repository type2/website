&gt; My engine runs warm - like 350-375 cylinder #3 temp (VDO guage).  Why is 
&gt; this, right after a rebuild?  So i took it to a local VW man.  He said 
&gt; that the engine itself checked out OK.  He said my high temp (which he 
&gt; argued was not close to overheating, which is like 450....)

If your sender is at the spark plug, the temps sound about right.

&gt; 2- the engine seal.  My engine seal is about 2' short, and I happened to 
&gt; leave the gap in the rear of the engine compartment.  (front is front)
&gt; Right above the muffler.  So when the engine doesn't get air from the chutes
&gt; (See #1) it gets hot muffler air. 

Which is all of the time, since the opening is so close by.  I would fix
this first.

&gt; Finally, he noted that I used the orange RTV stuff to seal the crankcase, 
&gt; as recommended by another VW guru at the time.  This VW man said that 
&gt; this kind of RTV left too big of a shim, and would cause early (about 40k 
&gt; miles) wear  on the bearings and case.  He recommended some kind of 
&gt; aviation RTV.  I do not buy this arguement.  What do you think?

He is right.  The case was designed to mate with no sealant at all!  When
I did my rebuild I was told *not* to use that RTV stuff.  I used some kind
of special stuff that was supposed to be okay (if used very sparingly, which
I did).  Don't know if it was avation RTV or not.  It was a dark brown
color and did not smell like it was silicon based.  If you want I can dig
out the can sometime and see what it's called.
