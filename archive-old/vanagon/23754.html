&gt;         It all works now! New grease lightens up the feel of the stick and I 
&gt; can reach all gears without effort. Worth being covered in moly slime for 
&gt; the morning. Tenacious stuff. I hope this survives a few good rain storms 
&gt; however. White grease (in a spray) I used a couple of months back was 
&gt; basically gone, no trace!? It had worked for a couple of weeks. Maybe CV 
&gt; joint grease is better?
&gt; 
White Lithium Grease is not water resistant and is no longer
recomended by VW for shift linkage lubrication.  VW says to
go with the CV stuff or cheaper generic Moly EP but remember
lithium and moly greases are INCOMPATIBLE and all the lithium
must be cleaned off the parts first.  Lithium also has that
annoying tendancy to turn into a rockhard sticky glue like
substance after 5+ years, check out any Bus shift linkage.
I highly second this advice, change to moly based now, and also
as a great lubricant for sliding door rails.  BTW somebody
once mentioned a spray moly EP grease for something like
motorcycle chain lubrication but I haven't been able to find
the stuff, anybody got any ideas?
