&gt;&gt;THATS IT!  If Ford enthusiasts are Fordnatics, that must mean that we're
&gt;&gt;VANATICS!
&gt;&gt;It has a certain ring to it doesn't it?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Yes it does!
&gt;
&gt;But one little glitch...
&gt;
&gt;VW is the only company that makes Vanagons, of course.
&gt;But it isn't the only one that makes vans. The name might apply
&gt;to Chevy vans, Ford vans...  Hmmmm...
&gt;
&gt;Vanagonatics?  Kinda long.
&gt;Vanagatics?   Nope.
&gt;Busnatics?   A stretch.
&gt;Vanageeks?   No thanks.
&gt;StreamlinedAsABrick?   REAL long.
&gt;
&gt;All IMHO, of course.
&gt;
&gt;How about it, sports fans? Get your entry in now before the deadline!
&gt;Win valuable prizes, not sold in stores, limited time only...
&gt;
&gt;BTW, even if we get something we like, who says the name of the list
&gt;has to change? Maybe the list administrator should have 51% of the vote?
&gt;Subject to appropriate pressure, threats, and bribes from interested
&gt;parties, of course.

How about Vanamaniacs?
