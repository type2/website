Subject: Re: what is the correct part number????

&gt;&gt;        I discovered a small leak by the rear heater in my '85
&gt;&gt;and dutifully called up and read about the &quot;new&quot; metal plug
&gt;&gt;............
&gt;&gt;The number I used is N 902 061 01.  Does any one know what the
&gt;&gt;CORRECT part number is?

&gt;according to the last fiche i have (for 1985 buses) from 1993, the part
&gt;number is on Frame 36-40 of the fiche, and is  861-819-039 ... that's the
&gt;bleeder screw. the sealing washer (under it) is 897-819-037.

&gt;get him to check it out and let us know if these new numbers are right (so
&gt;we can change the Tech stuff on the gopher).

	I saw the part he had in stock and it was a WHITE PLASTIC
jobber-doo.  I do not remenber the part number.  The part he had 
did look different, but it was still not a metal one like was mentioned
as a replacement.  He also checked for what was used in later year
models; same as what he had.  All on page 36-40 item #4.
