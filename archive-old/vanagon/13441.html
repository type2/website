Subject: friday funnies


Ok, ok, I know it doesn't have ANYTHING to do with vw's or even cars,
but I just couldn't resist, being that it's &quot;almost&quot; Friday:

---------

The results of the Spam Haiku contest!!!!!

  Cold, Pink, gelatinous mass,
  The potted meat for which I crave,
  Warns of impending earthquake.

  -----

  Ears, snouts and innards,
  A homogeneous mass.
  Pass another slice.

  -------

  Pink tender morsel,
  Glistening with salty gel.
  What the hell is it?

  ------

  Cube of cold pinkness
  Yellow specks of porcine fat.
  Give me a spork please.

  -----

  Old man seeks doctor.
  &quot;I eat SPAM daily&quot;, he says.
  Angioplasty.

  -----

  Delighted!
  I am flattered
  And overwhelmed to Pink.

  ------

  Highly unnatural,
  The tortured shape of this &quot;food&quot;.
  A small pink coffin.
