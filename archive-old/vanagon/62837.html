Subject: Re: Where to put VDO gauges

&gt;The only place on the dash that seems suitable would be on top of
&gt;the present instrument cluster. Unfortunately, wiring three gauges
there
&gt;would make removing the cover a minor nightmare.

No, it's not such a big problem. This is where I mounted my gauges in a
3-gauge VDO console. I just used enough wire so that the console can be
removed and set aside. I also used a Molex-style connector (from Radio
Shack) so that I can disconnect the whole thing if necessary.
