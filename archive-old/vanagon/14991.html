&gt; the Outer Banks, we all stay together a good long time, and people

&gt; Just my ramblings as usual

&gt; (lets see if I take the Corrado and a tent I can get back at 90 mph)
&gt; 
Just being a touch picky (It is the town I grew up in) Waynesboro is the 
town where the Skyline Drive meets I64 (Okay really it's Afton).  I 
actually prefer the Blue Ridge Parkway which is the Skyline Drive 
continuing south of I64.  The skyline drive is in Shenadoah National PArk 
which has cost disadvantages.  There are several really interesting stops 
on the Parkway - Raven's Roost, Peaks of Otter, ...   It would be 
possible to take the Parkway all the way to the Smokies.  I64 to the 
Cheasapeake is BORING.  Once you pass Charlottesville it is nothingness.  
A more intersting route might be to take 460 (think I got the right number) 
across the bottom of Virginia from Roanoke to Norfolk.  

It might be interesting to creep up the Bay side of the DelMarVa Penn. to 
DC then skip over to Bal'mere before heading north.

What criteria should be used to choose a route?  The Parkway is hilly but 
I've been up and down it in both a '69 and a '72 Westy when I was a kid.
