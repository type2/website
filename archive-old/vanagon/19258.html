Subject: American Science &amp; Surplus

&gt;I got the light fixtures from American Science &amp; Surplus (3605
&gt;Howard St., Skokie, IL 60076.  (708) 982-0870 )  The part number
&gt;for the lights is #10572.  Cost was about two bucks.


I live near this place and can not recomed it more.   If you are every in
this area you must visit it.    The store is someplace in chicago on
Northwest Ave near Milwakee Ave.   They also have FREE catalog that is just a
stich to read.  Each item has a brief and some what accurat description.  If
the original use and origin is know it is stated otherwise that just make
sumthing up.  Also included are silly suggestions.
This is a must the the do it your selfer you can get all sorts of weird and
useful stuff.

The Howard location is new to me. I will have to check it out.
thanks bob
