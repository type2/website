&gt; Has anybody done any mild customizing to their Vanagons? I'm
&gt;  looking for tasteful bolt-on dress up things like chin spoilers, ground
&gt;  effects (do the fiberglas rockers from '88 on fit the older vans?)

Yes. They'd fit, but unless you discover a special source for them, they're
very expensive.

&gt;  and wheels. I've looked for cast wheels locally, and from the Tire Rack,
but
&gt;  the best I could do were older Mercedes replica wheels (uglier than my
&gt;  current VW wheel covers) or the 5 spoke VW Weekender wheels (gorgeous, but
&gt;  $500 cdn).

These can be found used occasionally.  They typically sell for $100-$150 each
for ones in good condition.  I heard that Campbell-Nelson had them.  Mark
reported in March 1996:

&quot;A dealer in the Seattle had a number of brand new four-spoke alloys for 
$150 each. Lug nuts run another $40 per wheel. The dealer is Campbell 
Nelson VW, used parts department, phone 206.778.1131. Used alloys are very 
difficult to find. - Mark McCulley&quot;
