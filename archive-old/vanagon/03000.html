Subject: Re: Hard to read oil level?

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I, too, have noticed that it is VERY difficult to read
&gt;&gt; the oil-stick exactly!  All hints appreciated....
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Martha Martha...
&gt;
&gt;  I know at least 5 people on the list who have *no* problem
&gt;reading their oil-stick. You see, the oil-burners have a very
&gt;nice cap with a straight stick easily accessible from behind the
&gt;license plate..

I think the original question was about the gas engines.  Our 85 has
the dipstick that can be reached behind the license plate but it
bends toward the oil.  This makes it hard to see the level on the stick.
One side will show no oil while the other side will show the level.
I can't think of any solutions to the making it more visable except
to check both sides of the stick and check several times to be sure.
