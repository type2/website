&gt;Anyway, when parking, I pulled on the parking brake like I usually do and I
&gt;got a POP and then noticed that the handle went up a lot farther than it
&gt;used to.  I immediately suspected that I broke a cable and decided not to
&gt;use the parking brake until I got it figured out for sure.
&gt;
&gt;During lunch at work I crawled under the van to see what I could see (my
&gt;work clothes allow for that, I work in a tire shop :-) I could not see any
&gt;evidence of a broken cable.  Where the cable comes from the handle to the
&gt;equalizer bar is OK, and no real obvious looseness when I pulled on either
&gt;of the parking brake cables.  So I figure that rather than a broken cable I
&gt;may have a &quot;stretched&quot; cable, and one that stretched rather violently. 
&gt;Probably like the clutch cable on my old '78 Bus did.

Personally I'd *highly* recommend pulling both rear drums &amp; make sure you
don't have a problem with the e-brake linkage to the shoes - a 'pop'
indicates something letting loose (&amp; possibly temporarily catching on
something else) as opposed to stretching... btw, B4 letting her down off
the jacks, always apply the foot/hydraulic brake &amp; re-check that the wheels
turn with a slight scraping sound; allows things to settle into running
condition, which is often tighter than you may desire.
