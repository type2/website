I have had these exact symptoms with my clutch in my '86. I had the
original replaced about 15k ago, but the problem was not immediate nor
consistent. It seems to be fine now, but on warm days in stop-and-go
traffic it gets pretty bad.
I'm not sure that mine is a Sachs, but I will check with my mechanic.
