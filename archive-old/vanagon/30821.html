&gt;I have an early 80's Vanagon gas heater (BA-6) installed in my '65 Deluxe.
&gt;Its a flat muffler-looking unit that sits midships under the bus.  The
&gt;heat outlet connects directly to the main duct that runs forward to the cab
&gt;area of the bus.  The exhaust is vented to the side and slightly back on the
&gt;passenger side.  (This exhaust helped me un-freeze my tire pressure gauge
&gt;last night).  It draws air from a port under the rear seat/bed such that it
&gt;reheats the air from inside the bus.  Also the heat exchangers can be connected
&gt;to this system via port to the systems blower motor.
