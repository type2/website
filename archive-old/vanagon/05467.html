Ok,

	I went and traded my battery in on warranty this afternoon, and then
yanked the engine to replace the starter bushing.  The starter bushing
was _definitely_ hosed, being worn almost all the way thru on one side.

	I tested the starter in the bus before I put the engine back, and it
spun merrily along.

	I put the engine back in (new personal best time - 6 minutes!)  and
went to crank it over - it works!  Well, the starter does, anyway, the 
motor wouldn't start.  I think by now I'm out of gas!

	I fiddle with everything some more, and now its gone back to the starter
not doing anything and just hearing the relay click.  Probably another loose/
bad wire!  Oh well, until next weekend...
