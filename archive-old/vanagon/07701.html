Subject: Help me!  I've just purchased a pit to throw money into!

Our new baby ('81 Westy) just got its report card from the mechanic.  I
lost track of the dollar amount that it is going to run, but I think it's
safe to say we won't be going on that round the world trip anytime soon.
Actually, there is little wrong with the engine, per se (except some
misguided previous owner removed the cooling flaps from the engine and to
replace them is $350), but the fuel lines need replacing ($375) and the
brake rotors need replacing (I'm not sure how much this is going to run
us).  Plus we need a lot of other long term stuff done (front shocks, etc.)

He mentioned a few things that are just expensive because VW parts are such
a rip-off.  Does anyone think I would have much luck getting the following
things from a junkyard?

Driver's side window regulator
Sliding door locking mechanism
replacment muffler (can we replace the muffer ourselves or is this a pro job?)
EGR box
windsheild (we have two small cracks in ours)
engine cooling flaps

I would appreciate advice from the wise ones on the net as to which if any
of these parts will be practical to get from junkyard dealers.
