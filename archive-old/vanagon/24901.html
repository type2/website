Subject: Change the Stats - '91 MultiVan Purchased

Hello from north western Minnesota everyone,

No, the lakes aren't frozen up here yet, but it is time to
start preparing for winter.  That's one of the reasons
I recently bought ourselves a project Vanagon. It's a
wrecked '91 MultiVan without the engine, transmission,
power steering rack, fuel tank and fuel pump.  You might
just say all of the most valueable and popular parts were
taken off of it during the time it spent at the junk yard I
bought it from.

It needs alot of work and $$$$$$$$$ to fix it up.  We
bought it mostly for the interior to be transplanted into
our low mileage '87 Syncro but I am having all kinds of
thoughts about fixing it up.  So, we don't know yet what
we're going to do with it until we determine what the cost
will be to convert the '87 Syncro into a MultiVan with a 
pop-top using the '91 MultiVans' pop-top and interior.

I'm open to any ideas and suggestions anyone might have
as to what they would do.

Joel, for now, if you allow wrecked Vanagons in the stats, you
can add a '91 MultiVan.
