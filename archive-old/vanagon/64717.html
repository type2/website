Subject:      Poptop Skylight Update

Well, it looks like I came up with a hot one here.  :-)  As expected, I
have had more than enough response to sell all of the &quot;B-stock&quot; skylights
the that are coming.  I believe that I have confirmed directly everyone who
is getting one.  There is one person who has not yet confirmed his order,
but I already have an alternate in case he doesn't confirm.

As promised, I will honor the $93.50 price on brand new, perfect-stock ones
for people who missed the B-stock deal.  But frankly I'm not making much on
them at this price, so I'm going to limit that offer to the first ten
orders placed.  The B-stock skylights will be here towards the end of next
week, with the first quality ones expected to follow several days later.

Thanks,
