Thanks Jeff, 
&quot;Highway Locomotive&quot; huh? Sounds appropriate.  The van we're looking at 
has a VW extended warranty (12 months bumper to bumper) and does not 
sound like a diesel - all good things! 
Thanks for the input, if we get this then we'll be a three VW family (two 
Passats and a EV). 
 
Regards, 
Chris L. Miller
