Subject: It wasn't The One[tm]?

	Well, I saw it this weekend and the decision was, &quot;No.&quot;
It was freshly painted and looked like compentently rust-repaired.
It was a 63 crew cab, with a rebuilt engine. It was in regular
use by the owners, charming people. However, 

	The heaters weren't hooked up, some pieces missing
	The turn signals didn't work, probably the stalk switch ($$$)
	The brake lights didn't work reliably
	The void under the bed was full of water because the wooden slat
	attachments (rivets) hadn't been replaced, and so the holes were
	just open.
	1/4&quot; inch of standing water on the rear passenger compartment
	floor from same cause
	Original windows had been replaced with Safaris, which leak
	No metal cover under the pedals, master cylender, etc, up front.
	Visible rust damage under the new paint where the battery goes
	One bolt missing from reduction box on passenger side.
	Underside paint all original- with surface rust in many places.
	Hard to start
	Bottom of engine black with leaking oil, little drips on bolt-heads.
	Bottom of tranny brown with leaking oil, little drips on bolt-heads.
	Various small bits were shot or missing- air-cleaner boot, engine
cover hold-up spring or whatever it is, license plate lamp cover. Bed slats
were warped and aging from water exposture- they're still raw wood, not
finished.

	In short, not what I consider a $4900 restoration.

	Steering seemed solid, it drove ok up to freeway speed, it
stopped reasonably well. But for a guy with a full time job, the deep
electrical needs (dome light didn't work either), lack of heater and
water problems in the back seat foot area and the void under the bed
were too much. At half the price, I would have bought it anyway, but for
the full $$$, well, I'd have to spend about $2K for parts and labor
to have the obvious problems taken care of. If I tried to do it myself,
I might still be at it in 1996!

	It was white originally, and they've painted it an authentic
VW dark grey, one of my favorite colors, actually, with a beautiful
interior re-do in matching grey vinyl and light grey piping. Someone
with time on their hands or who doesn't want to use it regularly 
could be well-rewarded by checking it out. I'll post the phone
number if anyone wants it.

	So go ahead, tell me I blew it. I have to belive that $5K, 
even $4K, buys a better crew-cab transporter.

	Sigh.
	Bill
