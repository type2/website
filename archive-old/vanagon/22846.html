I found this little goody at the listed address... 

is joel moonlighting as a consultant to the British Army?  is he holding out 
on us with the development of the newest Westfalia?  A Six All-Wheel 
Drive Vanagon?  is THAT why he's been so quiet lately?

&gt; Swamp Walker
&gt; 
&gt; HONITON, ENGLAND--A little-known truck is bringing new meaning to
&gt; the phrase all-terrain vehicle.
&gt; 
&gt;  [Image] Six-wheeling Supacat uses dual steering system to traverse
&gt;          inhospitable terrain.
&gt; 
&gt; Used by the British Army, the 6-wheeled Supacat can handle anything
&gt; from deep mud to hard ice. It climbs 100% gradients and negotiates
&gt; sideways slopes of 40%. It can even float.
&gt; 
&gt; Supacat's signature technology is a unique handlebar, which allows
&gt; two types of steering. Conventional steering turns the front two
&gt; axles. By pulling back on either side of the handlebar, the driver
&gt; activates skid steering, which brakes the three wheels on one side
&gt; of the vehicle to permit tight turns and extra traction. A
&gt; turbocharged VW diesel engine supplies the pull, and wide
&gt; low-pressure tires avoid tearing up the ground.
&gt; 

gee-  i bet derek would like one of these to uh, field test.  :)
