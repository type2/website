Subject: part for sale: coolant temp sensor
Date: Mon, 15 Jul 1996 12:36:04 -0700

I have a new coolant temp sensor for sale, VW part # 025 906 041 A. I 
believe this fits 86-91 non-syncro Vanagons. Can't use it on my Vanagon 
because it's a syncro. This is the sensor that goes in the thermostat 
housing and connects to the ECU. $12 including shipping.
