Subject: Who needs Gas Heater service manuals?

I went to the copy center today to have a gas heater manual xeroxed, and, 
since a few people have asked about them, I had them run a couple extra 
copies of each.  If you need one, it's yours for the cost of the copies and 
postage.

One is the service manual for a BA4.  This is the heater from a 411/412, 
and is virtually identical to the BA6 heater used in a '76-up Bus and 
Vanagon.  Only real difference is the size of the chamber.  Includes 
testing, troubleshooting, repair procedures, schematics, etc.

The other is a pair of shop manuals for the earlier BN4 bus gas heater. 
Extremely complete, and cover both early and late versions.

Both these manuals are roughly 50 pages.  I paid the printer about $5 each 
for the photocopies, and I'd guess postage will cost about $2.  If you need 
one, e-mail me (first come first serve).

Thanks,
Ron Salmon
