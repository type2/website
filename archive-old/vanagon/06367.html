Subject: anybody know of problems with '93 EV brakes?


My wife and the local dealer are having a friendly 'war' on the 
matter of the EV brakes.  She thinks that they are not functioning well.

The dealer says he thinks they feel they they should when they test drive the
EV.  In all fairness, it could be the difference between the '87 Vanagon
braking and the EV braking -- I had noticed that the EV brakes felt a lot
tougher compared to the vanagon's, when I drove it the first time.  I had
quickly found out that the EV brakes were nearly impossible to lock, even in
snow, so I had attributed the different feel to a 'feature' and not a 'bug' 
(pun NOT intended)...

In any case, has anyone heard anything like a recall or a murmur about the EV
brakes??? I'd appreciate any and all help...

BTW, the Brake fluid is O.K., and it is not getting low or anything.  When I
     drive the EV, the brakes definitely feel different than the 87 Vanagon, 
     but I do not know what to make of it...


Thanks,

posting from the state Ric should be proud of right now -- Rick Santorum
was just declared that he upset H. Wofford for US ssenate, and T. Ridge
was just declared the winner in the Gubernatorial...
