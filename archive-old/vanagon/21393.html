1.  Drop the spare and then remove the 4 ten mm nuts holding the tin box
surrounding the shifter from underneath where the spare was.
Have your friend wiggle the shifter and you will see a sloppy pin.  I
replaced mine with a bolt.

2.  Go to the fwd end of the tranny from under.  Remove the 19mm nut that is
holding a 4' long pin the shift rod slides on.  Remove the long pin and you
will see a plastic bushing.  Remove that bushing to take to your local VW
outlet and say, &quot;I want one just like this, only different.&quot;

If you don't want to wait for this little part, just replace the plastic
bushing with a 1/4&quot; long piece of 5/16 fuel hose.  That will work for several
months while you wait for the part, and have to crawl under again.

If you buy the whole pin with bush and boot from a dealer, it's about $60.
 The bush is a buck, the boot is $6 at my local Vdub store.

These two little steps will fix your sloppy shift!
