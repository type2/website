Subject: Fans,

	Cetin, Dave,
	Fans don't cavitate, they stall. Cavitation is when pressure
drop on the front side and tips of a propellor in water causes gas 
bubbles to form- cavities. You could get something similar in air
if your fan were supersonic.
	Just like a wing not going fast enough, or going at too steep
an angle, the stalled fan blade is just thrashing in the air
	Otherwise the analysis matches my experience- the fan
goes faster AND uses less energy if it isn't able to pump air.
Makes sense. Electric motors have their highest draw at stall, don't
they? 

	Cheers!
