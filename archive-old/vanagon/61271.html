&lt;&lt; Also Ed Berroth (aka EdBuzz_at_aol_dot_com) described an in-dash unit last Fall
 (1996).  If anyone has any information on this unit or how to get in touch
 with Ed please let me know.  I've tried email and phone directories but
 I've not been able to reach him.

Listmember William Kennedy ( of '81 3liter flat 6 Porsche powered Vanagon
fame) had some info on this in-dash A/C unit.  It was the same as used on
some of the Porsches.
Listmember Tony Moore has a friend who has a '81 sunroof Vanagon with this
unit installed. You lose your in-dash radio, as this space is now taken for
A/C vents, and you also lose some of your glovebox storage as the evaporator
is mounted behind the glovebox. The radio was mounted in a compartment behind
the shift lever (it was a automatic..yeah, I know, AT and AC in a aircooled
Vanagon...real speed demon...:&lt;)
It was well installed, and to the average person, it wasn't even obvious that
the Van even had a/c, and the radio being at floor level was also a theft
deterrent. 
Neat setup, the only one I've ever seen.
