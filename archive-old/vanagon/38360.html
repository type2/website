Subject: fuel problem?

Hi.  I'm about to embark on an enless journey, but I need some help for 
my '79 westy before I go.  

There is some sort of intermitenet fuel problem.  It can happen when the 
engine is warm or cold and at various speeds.  Here's what it does:
As I'm driving along, it will be as if all of a sudden I have no more 
fuel than at idle speed.  Then within a half second to a couple seconds, 
the fuel kicks back in.  Sometimes it just happens once, like a burp.  
Other times it will happen a few times in a row.  I can drive many miles 
without it happening as well.  I've tried throwing it in neutral as it's 
happening and revving the engine a bit.  Sometimes it will rev normally, 
and sometimes it exhibits the same symptoms - something like 1/2 second 
of increased engine speed followed by idle speed....with the gas pedal 
depressed.  I should note that the engine sounds great at idle and at 
faster rpm when the fuel is being delivered.

Anyone have any ideas?  I've changed the fuel filter even though I was 
pretty sure that wouldn't solve the problem.  Could it be bad gas??  

I would appreciate any help with this as I'm anxious to hit the road.  
Thanks ahead of time for all replies.
