&gt; The thing that's always bothered me about my paint jobs is the brush marks.
&gt;  By the time you get them all rubbed out you're just about down to bare metal
&gt; again.  And don't talke to me about spray-paint, I tried it.  Don't work.
&gt;  The nozzle clogs up about once a minute and your arm gets tired of pumping
&gt; before you got the job half done.  Besides, nowadays you can't hardy find a
&gt; good fly-sprayer, everybody using those spritz cans.  Oh, I tried them too
&gt; but don't see the sense of it.  Soon as you get the top off the stuff gets
&gt; all over you.
&gt; 
&gt; Sponges.  That's the ticket.  I don't know why I didn't think of it sooner.

 I had a housemate once that bought a very delapidated (sp?) Capri, with 
 rust holes all over it and appalling paint. Cost about 50 quid. 

 First he filled all the rust holes with some expanding foam stuff, the
 sort that builders use to fill gaps in under windows etc. It expands 
 amazingly and goes quite hard. So he cut the excess foam back to the
 body level and then using a paint roller, did the whole car in black
 enamal fireplace paint. Gave the car a `textured' finish. It actually
 didn't look to bad provided you just glanced at it from a distance. ;)

 He drove it around for a few months, re-rollered it black (easier
 than washing it he claimed!) then sold it for a fairly large profit.

 All true I'm afraid...
