Subject: Re: EV Piston Slap Questions

&gt;I know that this has been covered before but I need some questions
&gt;answered.  Hopefully some of the been there, done that's can help me.
&gt;I made an appointment to take my 93 EV to the dealer next week for a
&gt;possible piston slap problem.  Symptom is the van sounds like a diesel for
&gt;about ten minutes after starting. 

Hmm... I can't believe I'm answering an EV post, but.....

I have an '84 Audi 5000 S turbo with 135k mi. that I drive daily. (then what the
hell do you do with all those VW vans?? - Yard Art....ya know... :&lt;)  Anyway, I
bought the car when it was 4 yrs old and had approx. 50k mi. on it. When I got
it, in the morning when the engine was cold, the lifters would tap for a few
minutes until it warmed up. 
now at 135k mi. the lifters still tap when the engine is cold - no more, no
less. It is a charachteristic of the 5 banger, and is no cause for alarm.  At
135k mi., the valve cover has never been off this engine, and probably won't be
for a loooong time. The 5 bangers are virtually indestructable.  Head gaskets??
What are head gaskets??

Hmmm.... maybe I'll save up and order one of them brand new South African
&quot;Vanagons&quot; (actually they call 'em Buses) that have the 5 banger in the back. 
A Vanagon that you'd never have to do head gaskets on....imagine......
