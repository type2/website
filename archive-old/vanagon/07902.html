&gt; Anyways, if you plan to go above 60 mph...don't get a pre-67 bus.

&gt; Sorry my posts are obscure...ask for a translation...will oblige.
&gt; I can go 60 in my bus...55 is the SPEED LIMIT...so I'm OK.

&gt;  My memories of my '64 are very much in agreement with what Eric says here.
   Also, IMHO, the handling, brakes, and crosswind stability are so bad on 
   the old buses that pumping up the horsepower for higher speeds would be
   unwise without modifications to substantially improve those attributes.
