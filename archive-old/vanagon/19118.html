Subject: Re: fix the plug!!!


Hmmm....  I've got a real tight (and, methinks, seized) plug on #2 in my 
'76.  This is a plug I did the Big Trip on, so it's got about 16,000 
miles on it now.  I'm only going to be driving the bus until Sept (when 
it goes into storage), and I use it only for camping/fun trips, so I'll 
only put another 1,500 or so on it before winter.  

I wasn't really too concerned about it (I'll get to it this winter), then 
Michael &quot;No-one-waves-to-me&quot; Wagner seems pretty concerned about this 
problem--in other people's buses, anyway.  :)  

Should I take care of it sooner?  Seems like a lot of work for something 
I'd take care of in another 1,500 anyway...  Opinions?
