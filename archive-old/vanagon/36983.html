&gt;	We have the ultimate, a lime green '78 Westy as our chariott. 144,000 
&gt;miles on her. For the most part we are VW rookies and WE NEED HELP (with 
&gt;our van). Problems/Questions we have:
&gt;1) Below half a tank our fuel gage doesn't work! (arrgh!)  

Replace the fuel gauge sending unit. The engine and fuel tank should be
removed for this operation.  Maybe wait 'till your clutch goes out on you
and do this while the engine is already out of the car.  Until then, stop
every 225 miles and re-fuel.
 
&gt;2) High Beams occasionally stick &quot;on&quot;.

Get a good wiring diagram and continuity tester. Check the wiring and condition
of the turn signal switch on the column and the hi-beam relay.

&gt;3) Seal for pop-top is beyond hope.

Replacements are available for $50-75 range.  Check the VW enthusiast magazines
for recent advertizments.  Do not get this thing from the dealer it's over $200!

&gt;4) gas-tank filler spout seal (at top where you fill'er up) leaks. (we 
&gt;have it sealed with silicone for now.)

You need to replace that rubber seal with a new one.  The job is difficult unless
you have tiny hands and are very limber.  While you're at it, replace all the fuel
line and fuel tank vent hoses.  After &gt;144,000 miles, the rubber is dried out and
brittle.  Gasoline will explode/burn.

&gt;5) What's with the superfluous muffler?

Most everything that VW put on the vehicle is there for a reason.  Perhaps what you
see as a muffler is an auxiliary gasoline heater.  Then again maybe your seeing 
straight and you have major exhaust leaks, leaving the muffler out of the exhaust 
system altogether.  Fix any exhaust component that has failed.

&gt;6) Heater box has holes in it.

How often do you plan on using the heater on this trip?  Replacement heater boxes
are available or maybe you can weld patches on the old ones.  Check the VW mags for
aftermarket parts (see #3).

&gt;7) She has 195/R14 tires (is that strange?)

No.  The '78 bus has 14 inch rims and I think that 195s are not too wide
that they would rub the wheelwells.

You're going to have to do basic maintenance on this bus or it's going 
to break down on you eventually.  Get a couple good shop manuals and a 
tool kit with some spare parts.  Parts and services may not be available
down south so do all you can to get things ship shape before you go.

Cheers,
