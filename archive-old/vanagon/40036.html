Subject: Re: bastard  model 235

and  mjhenks_at_engr.csulb_dot_edu (Matthew Henricks) thus wrote about Micheal
heron's new 1960 type 235 bus' poor motor:

valve covers                  (only if you use &quot;bastard&quot; heads)
28PCI carb.                   (manual chock)
intake manifold               (only if you use &quot;bastard heads)
distributor.  VJR 4 BR25      (cast iron body, centrifugal advanced)
cylender head tin             (has a raised section right by the head ID#)
fuel pump               (the feul out line is straight up, not at a angle)


that is all you rreally need to make it look like the motor.  if you can
get ahold of a case, then there a alot of other parts you will need.  I
know where you can get most of these parts if you are going to try and
build one.

My bood has alot of specific charicteristics of this motor.  if you need
any other info, let me know.

ps.  Not wanting to rehash a old subject, but does this sound correct to
     you clara?
------------

yup-   I too have a bastard motor in the garage.  It was in David Glass' 53
truck when he got it, and i was persuaded against my better judgement to haul
the d$#% thing from Alberta to Western Washington.  Well, it turns and seems
to have sompression so some day I'll start 'er up and see what gives.   

I also know someone who has some NOS tin for same motor.
