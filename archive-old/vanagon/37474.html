Subject: Re: Vanagon Westy Accessory Boxes..

When I converted a vanagon to Westfalia I found these &quot;black accessory 
boxes&quot; for about $15 each at a trailer supply wholesale outlet here in 
Seattle.  The place is now out of business, but this is at least a frame 
of reference.  By the way, the trailer parts dealer said the black boxes 
were poorly made and he talked me out of using them.

&gt; Hi Everyone.  I was doing some checking while I was at the dealer today 
&gt; about the costs of these black accessory boxes.  I couldn't believe 
&gt; the costs of these parts.
&gt; 
&gt; City water .. $162.34CDN
&gt; water tank    $163.97CDN
&gt; electrical       $212.35CDN (for Canadian Westy's only)
&gt; the above includes gaskets
&gt; 
&gt; Yesterday, I received a fax from Euro-American RV Products (Delta-Six 
&gt; Industries). This is the company that makes the parts for 
&gt; VW/Westfalia.   Here are their prices:
&gt; 
&gt; city water  $29.50 US
&gt; water tank $35.50 US
&gt; electrical    $32.50 US (for US Westy's only)
&gt; electrical    $34.00 US (for Canadian Westy's only)
&gt; gaskets       $4.24 US each
&gt; 
&gt; So, hmm.. even with a 35% exchange rate, shipping, even duty.. errr.. 
&gt; there's a bit of a savings here!!!
&gt; 
&gt; For those new to the list, Euro-American can be reached at:
&gt; 
&gt; Euro-American RV Products,
&gt; 5517 Cleon Ave,
&gt; North Hollywood, CA  91601
