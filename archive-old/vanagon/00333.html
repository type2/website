I wrote this about a week ago before the power thread got rolling hot 'n' 
heavy, so I guess I'll post it now.
---------
I find the discussion of power rather humorous.  I've got an '84 with a 
1915cc engine, and I've never experienced a power problem.  It goes 65 on 
the highway and accelerates up the steepest hills in St. Paul, MN.  No 
mountains, certainly, but I think power is overrated.  Unless I'm
pulling someone out of the ditch or pulling a trailer over mountains, 
this'll be plenty of power for me.  I drove with 6 adults and two 
childern around town this past weekend (over 1000 pounds) and it drove 
just like it did empty. My Toyota has a 2000 cc engine, is a LOT smaller, 
and when I get 5 people in it, I KNOW it. I used to own a Chevy cargo van 
with a 350 cubic inch engine, and it went 65 on the highway too.  It IS 
the speed limit here.

Afterthoughts:
I've only glanced at the Eurovan -- not ridden one, so I'm not an expert,
but if I remember, there isn't the storage space behind the last seat like
the vanagon (Please correct me publicly if I'm wrong on that).  I guess,
for me, that makes it a minivan.  Consumer Reports also lists it as &quot;Body
style: minivan&quot;  What make it different from the Vanagon is the nose. That
engine takes up precious passenger and cargo space. The competition for 
the Eurovan on body styles alone in the U.S. is still the other minivans 
in the public's eye.  Technically right or wrong, that's the perception.
