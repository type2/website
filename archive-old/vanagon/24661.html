Subject: Re: Re: Waving Vanagon drivers (again)

I wonder, when I wave to the breadloaves here in Columbus (ie Ohio State
U.) I get a blank stare for a reply.  Even from other VW campers.  The
splittys always wave back.  The Vanagon-no Vanagon Campers yes.  We even
stopped and exchanged names/numbers.  i have only encountered on EV Westy,
but we were in the same parking lot.
