Subject: Re: No go on ice


&gt;&gt;One tire dealer was trying to dissuade me from adding studs to my new 
snows.
&gt;&gt;His argument concluded with  &quot;... and besides, studs are only useful on 
ice.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;And forget about adding fog lights--the're only useful in fog...

May as well lose the engine too... it's only useful when speeding up.  :^)
