Subject: Advice on buying 86-on Vanagon

I am looking for advice reguarding switching from an 85 Westy pop-top
weekender to a non-westy 86 on vangon.  What about automatic vrs man.
transmission? Power differences? I found out I am not the camping type and
would like to make this switch.
Thanks,

Bill Lund
