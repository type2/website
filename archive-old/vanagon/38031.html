&gt;Forgive my split ignorance, is the parcel shelf the one under dash? I
&gt; saw something in the WCM catalog , part # 211-110 $125 for 68-79 that
&gt; was described as such. If they are that handy I may whip something up.

Sure, under the dash. We essentially have the same cab interior they do,
it's just our dash is uglier (OK, I covet the metal dash, too). ;)
