&gt;Bob's original point was that the alternator wouldn't charge the battery 
&gt;and power all the super spot lights.  That is not disputed is it?


To All,

I'm sorry to have left the above impression.  The point I was trying to make
is that if you suck 60 amps continuously from a 60 amp alternator (which I
think will absorb about 5 horsepower), it will drastically shorten the life
of the alternator.

Regarding the original post, the gentleman may have misunderstood some early
(mid-1950's) hype in the automotive magazines about Volkswagens getting their
electrical power for 'free' since the generator was used to drive the fan.
 The use of 'free' was unfortunate since they obviously didn't mean it in the
mechanical sense but in the engineering sense, in comparison with a
water-cooled engine that (usually) has completely separate cooling and
electrical generation systems.  (The water-cooled Fiat  600 drives the
radiator fan off the end of the alternator.)

If you wish to see just how much energy is being absorbed by your blower and
alternator, disconnect the fan belt and go drag racing.  You'll be in for a
nice surprise.  (And a burned up engine :-)  Bug Eats Lexus - News at Eleven!
