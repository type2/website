&gt; Hello to all,
&gt; 
&gt; I have a '65 split window, original paint, original interior (excpt 
&gt; uplstry), only a little rust (under the battery), with a '71  1600 SP, 
&gt; original leaking trans, original leaking weather stripping. It sounds 
&gt; pretty desperate but it runs well and looks pretty nice too.
&gt;   My wife and 
&gt; I are planning to move from Western Colorado (Dry) to the Twin Cities (Wet).
&gt; I am continually wrestling with the idea (and the cost) of a complete 
&gt; restoration, but sometimes I feel that it is necessary in order to keep 
&gt; this 30 yr. old vehicle on the road.
&gt; I would like to hear some opinions regarding the restoration of such a 
&gt; vehicle (the guy who sold it to me felt it should be placed in a museum) 
&gt; i.e. NOT DRIVEN, but he also pieced together the enging using misc. parts 
&gt; which I have subsequently removed and replaced-  so he really showed some 
&gt; inconsistencies.
&gt;  Where should I begin?
&gt; Are there any anti-rust compounds (I've heard of a zinc/nitro mixture???)?
&gt; Will a move to Minnesota be the death of my bus? 
&gt; Should I stop driving it in order to save it-  This doesn't seem to do 
&gt; her justice.
&gt; Any advice or philosophical discourse (to drive or not to drive) (to 
&gt; restore or not to restore)  would be greatly welcomed.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks, 
&gt; Corbin Connell

OPINION TO FOLLOW:  Please find your grain of salt now.

The concept of a volkswagen is utilitarian.  Within reason my thought 
would be to keep your bus useful.  VW itself has a museum - not EVERY old 
bus or bug should go into a museum- that would be a waste.  Utilitarian 
implies useability.  Modifications that make a VW more useable make sense 
- hacking the body to put Baja Tires on a street vehicle does not.  I'd 
keep stock what you can but not sweat what you can't.  DRIVE IT.  I would.
