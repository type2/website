&gt;         So now I have an RPM gauge...but.....I need to know what sort of

&gt; some kind person could gimmie that peice o' knowledge I would be much
&gt; obliged.
My rules of thumb:
Flat level driving above ~2300 rpm in 3rd/4th
Climbing hills, above ~3000 rpm
Shift at around ~4500 rpm, although up to 5000 or so required on 
steep hills to avoid lugging in next gear.

&gt;         I also managed to get an oil change done, although Id like to
&gt; strangle the punk who tightened the oil filter on with a 2km long leverage
&gt; bar. AAAAAArgh.
This is what they make those big Craftsman screwdrivers for - punch 
it through &amp; turn... ;)

&gt;         And on a bad note I managed to strip a wheel bolt. I freind kindly
&gt; told me come by his place of employment later this week and we'll re-tap
&gt; the top, screwed up(no pun intended) part.
I *always* use a torque wrench on mine now, after having them almost 
sieze before.
