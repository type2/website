Subject: Vanagon/Eurovan rentals in Colorado?

Randy,

Not aware of any locally, but as I recall there's a guy on the list that 
does rent VWs out of Albuquerque.  Hopefully he, or someone that 
remembers his name, will forward the info on to you.  He may know of 
someone hereabouts that does do rentals.  A call to a local dealership 
turned up zip.

And no, you can't rent mine...;).

Jack
