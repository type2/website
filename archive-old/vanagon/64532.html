Subject:      BN-4 heater FS

i am selling my BN-4 heater.  i was going to put it in my vanagon but
 realistically won't get around to installing it. it is a very nice
unit.

Price: $330 firm.  i pay shipping and COD charges to anywhere in
the 48 US states.

Sales Pitch/Hype:  the late model BN-4 is a marvel of
electromechanical engineering.  it has multiple redundant safety
controls, temp control, and is very serviceable by the user.  these
heaters put out an estimated 4,000-16,000 BTU.  they are designed
to be used while driving or stationary.  i have completely
disassemble the unit, cleaned it, adjusted the switches, and set the
fuel pump. it works wonderfully and puts out of gobs of heat on very
little gasoline-- it will run between 6-16.5 hours per US gallon of
gasoline.


Description:  this is a BN-4 from a Type 181 Thing.  it is the late
generation with the metering style fuel pump (vs float type) for best
economy and combustion.  it is about the size of a 1.5 lb loaf of
split top wheat bread :-)

Included:
- copied portions of heater service manuals including detailed
installation instructions from Espar.
- exhaust pipe for 181.  the key part here is the flange and clamp
that attaches to the heater as it is very unique.  an exhaust system
can be fabricated from this flange.
- intake hoses for fresh combustion air
- plastic fresh air intake and heated air shrouds.  the exhaust piece
has been modified by me for attachment to ductwork.
- heated air thermostat
- a brand NEW VW timer switch (the Green Knob) that is wonderful.  it
can switch the heater on while the ignition is on or just run the
heater for 10 minutes while the key is off.  this is an incredibly
expensive dealer item.. i was quoted $165 from the dealer.
- a baggie of spare motor parts eg points, condensor, etc. if i can
find it in my garage
- 4 rubber mounting studs.

i will include a wiring diagram of how i intended to hook it up in my
'87 Westy utilizing the timer switch.

if you are interested, please contact me directly as i am not
subscribed to this list anymore.
