&gt;&gt;I measured the resistance of the coil to distrib. wire at 1000 ohms.  
&gt;&gt;Bentley says 2000 -+800.  The spark plug leads measured at 3500 ohms, 
&gt;&gt;and Bentley says 6000 -+1000.  These measurements are from end to end 
&gt;&gt;which includes the resistors.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Since the resistance I am getting is approx half of what it should 
&gt;&gt;be, is this good, bad or OK?  Is it time to get new wires?  The van 
&gt;&gt;has 112500 km (70000 miles) on it, and is 5 years old.  My 
&gt;&gt;multi-meter isn't the best in the world, but I'm sure it couldn't be 
&gt;&gt;that far out (I properly calibrated it, etc).

I happened to measure the ignition wires/rotor/coil resistance of my 84
vanagon a month a go. I did get all resistance within the spec the Bentley
manual says. The van is 10+ years old.
