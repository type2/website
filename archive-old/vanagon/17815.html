&gt; 
&gt; I'm looking for an awning with a side tent/room for a Eurovan.
&gt; 
Well not a tent/room solution but for an easy awning try this.
A friend of mine with a late model Vanagon Westy had a
real cheap and easy idea for an awning.  He bought a better quality
plastic tarp, one of the silver ones to resist UV with real brass
grommets (could use a canvas one but they are heavy and $$$) and
3 of those collapsible tent poles with the little push button height
selection at a RV shop.  Now how he attached it was what I thought
was swift, he took three 3-4 foot sections of probably 1.5&quot; PVC pipe
slit em down one side on a table saw so there was a 1/8&quot; or so slit
missing then would simply put the tarp over the drip edge of the rain
gutter and pop the PVC tube over the edge and it would be retained
nicely by that little plastic edge covering, then he set up the three
poles in front and some guide lines and whalla, instant cheap awning. 
In fact if you could get the poles at a yard sale, just really the
price of a tarp.  Of course this could all be mute, does the EV have
a standard old VW style drip channel or did it go the way of everything
else in the FWD redesign?  BTW Martha, the whole package only took up
say an area, 4&quot; in diameter by 3' long when rolled up, a reasonable
loss for the convenience of an awning IMHO and certainly less than a
genuine tent, and as this guy (retired) did some major trips, like
Florida to Alaska and back one summer, space was of prime importance
to him and his wife.
