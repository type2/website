Subject: Dreamy New Tires &amp; Pressure Inquiry

Hi All,

I broke down and bought a new set of tires for my 84 GL &quot;Brownie Bus&quot;
Vanagon.  The Continental Contact &amp; Transport 185 14's served me well
until the right front blew on me while transecting Kansas last weekend. 

After consulting the tire FAQ and the local ads, I opted for a set of
Michelin XC LT 4's (same as XCH 4).  Sears had them for $68.99 in the
195/75 x 14&quot;, load range 'C' (6 ply).  They handle like a dream!  Quite &amp;
smooth with a semi-aggressive tread.

They put 35 lbs of pressure in them.  It maxs at 50lbs.  I took the air
pressure up to 40lbs all the way around.  Any input as to the optimal tire
pressure on an 84 Vanagon?  I do a mix of driving and pulling and load
hauling.  TIA,
