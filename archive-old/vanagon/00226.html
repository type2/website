&gt;Jim &amp; Dean, I'm also very interrested in everyone's responses as I have a 1987
&gt;that exhibits a similar behavior (I think).  That is, when idling, the
&gt;RPMs will increase to about 2000 momentarily and then return to proper
&gt;idle speed.  Really weird the first time this happened while driving ...
&gt;I also have another problem that may or may not be related.  When I
&gt;first start the car in the morning, the idle is very rough and slow
&gt;(about 500 or so).  Sometimes the engine will stall, so I press the
&gt;accelerator slightly to keep the speed up. After a minute or two of
&gt;running, it's OK.  If it stalls though, it is very hard to restart and
&gt;sometimes there is the faint smell of gas.  Is it possible for it to be
&gt;choked too much ??!!

Now THAT's the behavior of a bad temp coolant sensor! and if you drive off,
it will stall/die at stop signs and red lights.  that's just about exactly     t
&gt;&gt; &gt; hurt) and the Van now has gone into it's idle hunt mode twice on Saturday,
&gt;&gt; &gt; and twice today (Monday).  It seems to be running better (when it runs
&gt;&gt; &gt; right).
&gt;
&gt;Yea, BIG bucks here.  Doesn't the dealer have the diagnostic equipment to
&gt;determine if the ECU is bad or not?
&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; you by replacing the whole wiring harness?!?
&gt;
&gt;If the dealer suggested to me a complete harness replacement I'd think
&gt;it very unprofessional and would interpret it as their way of telling
&gt;me they can't fix it.
