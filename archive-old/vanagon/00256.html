&gt; MSDS is Martin Schreiber Designed Systems. He has kits to put 911 motors into
&gt; Vanagon. He also has a neat grill guard for Vanagon and some other neat
&gt; stuff. There are 3 problems with his kits. Firstly, the 911 motor is
&gt; expensive ($5,000+? used). Secondly, you have no heat, which is unacceptable
&gt; to me as I drive in Vermont a lot in the winter. Thirdly, he put his motor
&gt; into a Syncro and went through two transmissions fast. He invented a mod you
&gt; all should do on your syncro transmission any time you go for a rebuild. This
&gt; mod will allow the transmission to last longer and stand up to bigger motors.

Another source for this kind of thing of almost urban-myth proportions is
Kennedy Engineered Products.  They are really great.  For some reasonable
cash, they sell mounting plates and flywheels to mount just about any
type of engine to a type 2 tranny.  I helped a pal put a Toyota 3-TC into
his '76 westy.  I think the last time I spoke to him, he was getting
better than 30 m.p.g. and almost never had to downshift heading down into
Cal over the Siskiyou passes.  I kept blowing up my engines and I was
going to put a '63 buick super engine (251 cid aluminum V8 -- bought by
ROVER) in it until I changed my mind and bought my '84 gl.  They had kits
for lots of inexpensive motors.  The only problem with the Vanagon is that
it only has 12-1/2 inches clearance so every motor but the Subaru engine
required some fabrication in the rear deck area.  I heard that someone
else got around this by lowering the whole rear end (or raising the body I
guess).
