Subject: Piston slap/VW warranty coverage

Hi y'all,

I've been talking to a VW dealer in the Seattle area (Carter's) about
piston slap as a problem on some '93 Eurovans. I'm pretty sure mine has
this problem and I'm taking it in on Wednesday for a check.

Anyhoo, the maintenance manager told me he is aware of the problem, in
fact, the VW regional service rep had new pistons and sleeves installed in
HIS Eurovan because of piston slap, and it most certainly is covered by the
the 5 yr/50,000 mile powertrain warranty, therefore any required repairs
would be free.

Thought some of you might be interested (well, about 14 of you
anyway--that's about how many EV owners are on the list these days, right
Joel?).

Jeff
