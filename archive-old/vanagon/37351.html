Subject: re: '90 distributor cap

Harry, 

You probably got an answer to this one already, but I thought I'd 
share this: my Dad's 16V Jetta has the shielded cap with ground strap 
- the dealer sold him a plain Bosch cap &amp; said to swap the metal 
shield. It was *very* tight, but the cap did eventually slide out of 
the *top* of the metal shield. I think my Scirocco also has this 
setup. I still haven't found the cap on my Jetta Turbo Diesel, 
though... ;-)

Good Luck.
ps: Thanks for the info on the tires - I'm trying to find a local 
shop with a good price on them now.

I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
