Had a Syncro Camper sold out from under me last Summer.  Here in the Pacific
Northwest they seem to be rather rare and priced accordingly. Ended up
with a Westfalia 2 wheel drive automatic. Never had a slush bucket since my
'53 Ford Victoria (sold for $35).

So, Syncro syncophants, what's so hot about your rigs? And if they are so
good, is it feasible in the future when my automatic packs it in, to
convert a 2 wheeler to a Syncro, using wrecking yard remains? I know the
gas fill is located differently, but what else is different?
