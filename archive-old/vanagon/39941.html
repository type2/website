Austin inquires:

&gt; what is .../EDL?

I believe that would be Electronic Differential Lock, which, I guess,
is the nerdic equivalent of Traction Control System...  Anyway, if
you have ABS, and your name happens to be Ric and you're teaching
your son Erik how to late brake for an offramp, but he overcooks 
the apex and gets a wheel or two onto the loose stuff, the ABS/EDL
system is supposed to apply braking to the wheel(s) w/ less traction
and divert more power to the wheels that still have traction in an
effort to make one look like J M Fangio at his best...   ;-)

Now, I know Ric knows where I'm coming from, but for others who
read this as a personal attack, it is not...so there...

&gt; - 33k cash inc t &amp; l out the door

A bit rich for my tastes; for that kind of money I'd rather get a used
100CS Quattro wagon and have some coinage left over for gas.
