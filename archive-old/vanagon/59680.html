&gt; Good chance to meet listmembers from all up and down the east coast - we
&gt; should set something up where listmembers can meet at a specific time and
&gt; location on the show grounds.

Hear, hear.  It would be cool to get a good group together, could all 
meet for instance at Ron's Bus Depot booth? (I'm sure he'll have one) 
at a predetermined time.
