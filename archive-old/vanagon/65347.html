Subject:      86 ignition timing

----------
        Sorry for the such basic questions,however after reading several posts in
the archive and putting a timing light on my van I am confused.

        Should the v notch on the pulley line up with the case split at 2000-2500
rpm as the Bentley discribes page 28.42? My 86 is 8 degrees before this and
it runs good there.I did have temp sensor 2 pulled for this check.

        With temp sensor 2 connected and 3k rpm I have 44 degrees before the case
split.Is this ok? Seems about right to me but this was the first time I
have put a timing light on a 2.1L.

        Is the split in the case the same as tdc??
