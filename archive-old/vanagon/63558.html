Derek,

I put into the Calculator a 16&quot; rim with 235/80 tires (about 31&quot;
diameter) and a 6.13 final and got 73 mph _at_ 4000 rpm. With 25&quot; tires
(185/78x14) and a 4.86 final 4000 rpm I got 75.7 mph. Using my other
program it would take a 32&quot; tire to get to 75.9 mph. Is that what you
are looking for?

Scott 


&gt; Cool! But what I want to do is find out what size tires the factory
&gt; 6.13
&gt; gear ratio gears would cause us to purchase to have the van have the
&gt; same
&gt; characteristics as the 25&quot; tires that are original to the 4.86 gears.
&gt; 
&gt; I couldn't find out how to do this with the gearing calculator, so can
&gt; you
&gt; help?  ...or anybody else, for that matter?
&gt;
