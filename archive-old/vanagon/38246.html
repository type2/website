Subject: Timing marks question

According to Muir, my type I 1966 engine (the ID # starts with an F) should be 
timed to 7.5 degrees BTDC. The problem is, in the table that shows where each 
year is to be timed, it shows mine as having three timing marks (TDC, 7.5BTDC, 
10BTDC) but my pulley only has two marks. What do these stand for? TDC and 
7.5BTDC? Which one should I time to?

Thanks,

--Jonny
