&gt;What is with fart jokes...  My seven year old tells fart jokes! In fact =

&gt;the more times the word fart appears the funnier the joke seems to get. =

&gt;So Lay off the fart jokes.

I believe it was George Carlin in his &quot;7 words you can't say on =
Television&quot; routine that made this observation first: &quot;Farts are =
funny...one of the funniest words in the English language...&quot; he goes on =
to describe the &quot;between the cheek sneak&quot;...the &quot;under the armpit fart&quot;, =
etc...

I guess the only difference between me, your son and George Carlin, is =
that George Carlin has made tons of money because of fart jokes.
