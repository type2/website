 &lt;&lt; In all oppsed engines, exceeding 4000 rpm for any lenghth of time will
heat up the oil and
&gt;&gt;pound out the main bearings.  This pounding even happens to Waterboxers.

Why then do so many aircraft engines have horizontaly opposed engines? They
run at that rpm for long periods.  Also why has porsche used horizontaly
opposed engines for so long if there was an rpm limit so low?  I read in
Marks Engineering Hand Book that horizontaly opposed engines have the same
benifits as a v type engine.  A horizontaly opposed engine is a V with
180deg between banks.

If you can't dazzle them with brilliance,
