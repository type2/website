Neil Wigley says,

&gt;I agree that the man's behavior was unconscionable, but, &gt;again, I don't
&gt;think race has anything to do with it. Nor should it be &gt;reported by the
&gt;narrator.

It made the story funnier and besides it's a common stereotype that black
guys like to drive those big cadillacs.  No one is trying to make a racial
issue out of it except for you.  Get a life!

   ditto! nicely put...
