&gt;Hello everyone,
&gt;	I have an '86 Westy with 140K miles that has developed the dreaded
&gt;head gasket leak.  After looking through the archives it seems that there
&gt;are four options:
&gt;	1)  AlumaSeal/Bars Leak
&gt;	2)  Repair heads/Replace Gaskets (J.B. Weld)
&gt;	3)  Replace the heads/Gaskets
&gt;	4)  Replace engine
&gt;The main contingency is that I'm planning on driving down to Cabo San
&gt;Lucas at the tip of Baja.  I'm just guessing, but it seems that trouble
&gt;with the wasserboxer en mexico would be a major nightmare.  I also have
&gt;a %15 off coupon for the local VW dealer, which will bring the cost of a 
&gt;newly rebuilt engine to $1955.  I'm looking into replacing it myself as
&gt;I have time on my hands.  It seems as though replacing the engine may be 
&gt;easier than R&amp;R the heads.  At 140K miles is it just time to replace the 
&gt;engine?  Any comments greatly appreciated!

140,000 is a bit high, time for a rebuild.  Besides most of the expense
will be in the
heads anyway.
