So Norman Leong says:
&gt; 
&gt; 3) Picture this: you and the family are out for a nice Sunday drive in the
&gt; &quot;new&quot; 944 when you spot an EV in the Used Car lot of the (dreaded) VW 
&gt; dealer.  Curious, you stop to look it over and notice that it only has 
&gt; 10K mi. on the clock, and the tires, Michelin MXLs in 205/65/15, all look
&gt; &quot;almost new.&quot;  Drawing on all your lawyerly traits and ingratiating skills,
&gt; you manage to take the EV out for a test drive, alone, and inexplicably
&gt; find yourself in your driveway....
&gt; An hour later you're back at the dealership, telling the salesperson that
&gt; the EV wasn't really what you were looking for, that you were more of a 
&gt; Ford Windstar kind of car shopper....
&gt; Best of all, your tire dilemna has been postponed, oh, say 30K mi. or so.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; OK,OK, so #3 above is really a JOKE; I couldn't think of any more witty

Joke?  I thought that was the best idea by far!  Why didn't I think of that?
Why didn't Ric think of that?  Or Joel?  That sounds so cool, I've got to
try it.  But I already have reinforced tires on my van.  I'll need a set
to replace the ones taken from the test drive van.  Hey Ric!!.......

And now back to your regularly scheduled vanagon list reading program..

;)

&gt; options for Ric to pursue in his tire search, which must really be 
&gt; taking a toll on him, as he just hasn't been his ol' self since dukin' it
&gt; out with those Vintagevw folks last week...   :-)

Oh, I think Ric is just fine.  It just a while for the pot to simmer. ;)
