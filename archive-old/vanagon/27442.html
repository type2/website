SO if you the synchro bonks you on the head, is that why they call you
synchro head?

A similar problem exists with the hood shocks on the 911.  A popular solution
is to install 2 sets of shocks, ala off road race cars (yeah, I can see
coil-overs on your hatch with 28&quot; of travel!)

I don't know if this is feasible or not, but I thought it might be something
to look into.

A friend of mine has a 280Z, and it bonked me GOOD one time.  I was unloading
some stuff, so I raised the lid, and bent down to get the stuff.  It delayed
just enuf to get my head lined up under the latch before it came crashing
down.  &quot;I _like_ stories!&quot; - H. J. Simpson
