Howdy,

	I delved into my brakes again tonight, the problem I was trying to
solve was too much residual pressure in the system, caasing the brakes
to drag and the brake light to stay on.

	I took the master cylinder out and was going to replace it with 
one my friend gave me, but the resevoirs were incompatible so mine
had to go back in.  I cleaned it up real good in alcohol first, though.

	I noticed what I _thought_ could be the problem - the MC pushrod
was almost all the way out, ie preloaded.  St. Muir could only tell me
what to do if the brakes needed to be tightened, not loosened, so I
loosened it up to where I though the preload was right, and put it back 
together. Bled the brakes.  Now I have almost no brakes!

	I now know that I hafta screw it back in, but I'm wondering exactly
how far.  Until I get the right pedal feel and the brake light still works?

	Any ideas appreciated!
	
Thom
