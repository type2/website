&gt; UHhhhh   -- sorry folks.  By definition,  dielectric grease is a
&gt; non-conducting material (at least for direct current and any &quot;low&quot; frequency
&gt; alternating currents).

I _know_ this to be true, I just had to pass on my experience with the 
grease.  If anyone's got a logical explanation for why this would happen 
(current bleed across a thin film of dielectric grease), I'd love to hear 
the explanation.  This just happened to me last week so the experience is 
still fresh.

Who knows, maybe I got the &quot;electric&quot; grease and it was just mislabeled :).  
I'm going to check the resistance of the grease tonight and let the list 
know what I find.

Jack
