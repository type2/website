Subject: Re: oil galley's or galleries?

&gt;Hey you English majors, 
&gt;	What is the proper way to use this word?  Some write galley ---others
gallery.   I think its 
&gt;galley myself.   BTW can some one explain to me, step by step the properway
to install a threaded oil 
&gt;galley plug.  Should I purchase an aluminum,  brass or steel plug  with a
half inch standard American 
&gt;pipe thread?  What size drill bit should I use?   I guess  I will need to
buy a half inch pipe tap also.  
&gt;Should I use Teflon tape when installing or gasketcinch or nothing?  How
many plugs will I need for a 82 
&gt;Westy case? 
&gt;Thanks

Use green locktight, or at least red, for most any VW bolt or fitting
application.   Do not use the teflon tape, you can easily strip the thread
or break the case around the fitting without major effort.
