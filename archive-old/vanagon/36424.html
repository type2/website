&gt; a shopping centre parking lot.
&gt; So the bug unit can attach to the towing eyes with U-bolts.

TOW DOLLEY method, I have seen some very strange ways of towing 
cars&amp;buses but it is much safer to do it correctly than not.  Maybe 
there is a reason why a bus tow bar is made of unobtainium?

   I know HWY 17 &amp; you are a brave soul to have done that, I'm just 
trying to figure out which parking lot!
