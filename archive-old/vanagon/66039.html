Greetings
I have just noticed the unmistakable hum of wheel bearing wear out.  When
travelling at 50mph
the noise stops if I make a turn to the right but not if I turn to the left.
Is there any way to locate the offending wheel?  I am not even sure if it is
front or back.

Thanks,  Lloyd       dad_at_together_dot_net
