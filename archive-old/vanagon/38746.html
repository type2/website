Don't know about the V-8, but I'm driving a friend's &quot;73 that has a 2.? 
911 conversion for a few days. What a kick!  There's a *really* confused 
kid in a jacked up, early Mustang out there. It was almost pitiful to 
watch him. Hard to shift {it's got a 914 tranny}, but well worth the 
trouble! I want it!!!!
