&gt; &gt;Once a guy made a still for the purpose of fermenting cow sh*t. He would
&gt; &gt;shovel cow flops into this little still and add water and let them rank,
&gt; &gt;and he rigged up a valved system to capture the methane in inner tubes.
&gt; &gt;Then he injected the methane into the throat of the carb on his lawn
&gt; &gt;tractor and rode around on it for about one minute until the tube went
&gt; &gt;flat.
&gt; 
&gt; the visual imagery conjured up by the above paragraph absolutely boggles my
&gt; mind. i can just picture the guy's neighbors, looking out of their windows
&gt; at some hick with an inner tube tied to his lawn mower.  :)
&gt; 
&gt; i tell ya, folks ... the government is putting something in our water!! it's
&gt; affecting everybody!!!!

I guess you could say he literally drove the shit out of his lawnmower!  ;p
