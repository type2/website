DG&gt; All,
DG&gt;
DG&gt; Tonight while watching CNN, they did a story on the latest Nobel
DG&gt; Peace Prize winner Josef Rotblat. At the ceremony he arrives in
DG&gt; none other than a brown Vanagon.

        And I remark-glad to see that someone else caught that one. The
camera angle didn't make it too easy, but my SO can testify I was more
interested in the Vanagon that the guy. Although no nukes is a good
thing...

Peace,
