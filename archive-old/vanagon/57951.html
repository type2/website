&gt; &gt; I'm personally glad that your brit-ass is off this volkswagon
&gt; &gt; list....I'm not racist, i'm just tired of seeing ads from across the
&gt; &gt; sea with vehicles I can't afford to buy because of shitty shipping or
&gt; &gt; travelling costs..........no offense
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
Charles White,
What the hell is this crap??  Sounds like someone needs to realize that
there are more countries in the world than the USA and they have
Volkswagens too.  Speaking of Volkswagen, learn how to spell it, for
God's sake, it's written on the back of EVERY ONE!  

You're tired of seeing ads from across the sea for vehicles you can't
afford.  Well, now that's really too bad.  We'll have to all make sure
that no one that doesn't live in the US ever posts again because we
really wouldn't want to offend poor charles.  God forbid Charles would
have to see an ad for a vehicle he can't afford :-(

I'll be personally glad when Charles White's ass is off this list.

Sean
