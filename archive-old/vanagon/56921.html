Update on our CCCUs group trip to Pinnacles, March 21-24:

First of all, BIGJthanks to Ron Lussier, who, in his customary
great leadership role, has researched and arranged much of this trip.
He has kindly taken care of reservations for us at 
the group campground.  

Listed below are those I have signed up
to attend, but you need to confirm with me ASAP for a head count.
Reservations are for Friday night and Saturday night.  (Sunday
night is catch-as-catch-can, for those of us wishing to stay
that extra time. JIt is  Sunday evening that the celestial events
are supposed to be most observable, btw.).  Camping fee explaination
follows.  

PLEASEJNOTE:  We all need to reimburse
Ron at the site.  As Ron has coughed up his own personal $$s
to reserve this place for us; please let us not to exhibit our
usual flakiness - decide whether or not you are going and
try your best to stick to that decision.  As you can understand,
this can get tricky when obtaining group camping facilities, based
on head-count.

Ron arranged to get an entire RV loop reserved.  This loop 
holds 12 RVs, and 24 of us.  The cost is $6 / person / night, 
with a maximum charge of $24 / site / night.  This is a
little complicated, but here are some sample scenarios:

     Site contains:                         Charge / night:
     --------------------------------       ---------------
     2 vans, 1 person each                    $12
     2 vans, 3 persons total                  $18
     2 vans, 2 persons each                   $24
     3 vans, 4 adults and 2 kids              $24

Get it?  If we get more than 24 vans, there will be plenty of 
'overflow' sites, just not in our loop.  This is probably ideal 
for those who like a...ahem...quieter site.

Electricity will be available for those who wish to use it (one 
hookup / site).  The surcharge for electricity usage is $4.

SPECIAL NOTE: that the campground gates close at 11pm, so get 
there before then or you'll be camping on the street - literally.

DIRECTIONS:

To get to Pinnacles Campground from the Bay Area, follow route 101 South to
Gilroy.  Just south of Gilroy, take route 25 south.  Follow route 25
through Hollister, Tres Pinos, and Paicines.  Roughly an hour south of
Gilroy you'll see a large sign for Pinnacles National Monument and a road
to the right.  Take that road.  The campground is just before the park gate.

To get to Pinnacles from the southlands, you'll want to look at a map.  You
can take either 101 north to San Lucas, and then cut over to 25 north, or
take 5 north to Coalinga and 25 north.  Again, look at a map.
