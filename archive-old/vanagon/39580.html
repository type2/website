Subject: 1971 bus vs vanagon - dimensions?

Hi Vanagoneers,

I've tried to find this on various FAQ's and can't turn it up -- what are
the dimensions of the 80-83 (air) Vanagon vs. a 71 stock-body bus? 

The question here is garageability in a narrow garage. The bus *just* fits
-- the sideview mirrors clear by about an inch on either side. How much
wider is the vanagon? Would it fit in the same space if its mirrors were
rotated flat against the body?

There's also height. The bus has a plastic Pla-Cool fan cowling that sticks
up about 6-8 inches above the roof line. Would a Westy vanagon be any
taller? A non-Westy?

I realize that, given my vague descriptions, any answers might have to be
ballpark.

Thanks.  And thanks for your Pla-Cool Origins answers a couple of weeks ago.
