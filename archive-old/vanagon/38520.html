Subject: folding gas can

For those of you who's gas gauges work about as good as mine....

Several months ago, someone (it may have been Martha) was looking for a
folding gas can to stick under the seat for emergencies.  Well, while
looking thru some newsletter about Volvos (no, I don't own one and I don't
know how the newsletter came to me) I found an ad for one for $7.95.  It
looks pretty cool and I think I'm gonna get me one.  This thing says, &quot;The
Gas-O-Haul stores flat and opens up to hold about one gallon of fuel.  The
disposable carrier uses a metalized bladder inside a fiberboard case.&quot;
1-800-444-6473.  I think its from IPD in Portland, OR.

&lt;no, I'm not associated with them, I just thought I'd pass it along&gt;
