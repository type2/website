Subject:      Info for Inuvik possible-trekkers ...

for those of you planning or thinking of planning to go on the Inuvik
Northern Stampede and Thanksgiving Massacree, some recommended reading is

The Milepost,  $19.95 US ($22.95 Canadian), published by Vernon Publications,
Inc., 3000 Northup Way, Suite 200, Bellevue, WA 98004. (800) 726-4707,
(206) 827-9900, Fax (206) 822-9372. Visa/MC accepted.

this is THE information on the roads and sights and places to stop. mile by
mile (or km by km, if you prefer). admittedly, it is loaded with ads from
commercial businesses, hoping to get your business, rather than a lot of
stuff about free camping and such. but it is still really neat to look at
and read. and the editor drives a white syncro camper. :) &lt;and some pictures
of her and her bus are in the articles&gt;

and each issue comes with a big fold-out map of Alaska, Yukon, British
Columbia, the Northwest Territories, and Alberta.
