My Bus's DPO built a wooden shelf which runs from the instrument pod's
right side all the way across to the right side of the dashboard. Its
back rests on the dashboard (just in front of the defroster vents), and
its front has hinges that are attached to the front edge of the dashboard.
It is hinged so that one can get to the ashtray.

The shelf has a raised border, so things laying on top can't roll out. And
it has six holes of various sizes for cans, bottles, coffee cups, drink
containers, and hairbrushes. Also two tiny holes for pens.

It is unpainted and stained with coffee but is tremendously useful.
Adds a bit of rustic charm to the interior.
