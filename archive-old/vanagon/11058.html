Subject: Re: Synchro trans leak

&gt;On my 86 Synchro, I've replaced the seal around the drive shaft that
&gt;comes out of the transmission to the front differential.
&gt;
&gt;I still have a leak from this seal. On my garage floor, I get about a
&gt;quarter sized drop once a week.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone have any ideas why this seal continues to leak?

Seals need to 'weep' a bit to keep the edges lubed and working, but how much...?
 I can't guess either, but fluid making it to the ground instead of being 
soaked into the dirt on the tranny sounds like too much. Did you seat the 
seals well, no pinching/folds/cuts and tears? How long did this take you 
BTW, my '87 is leaking there also. TIA.    tim s.
