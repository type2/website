Subject: f/ Distributor cam lube.

someone had made a joking reference that one tube of this stuff will 
last a lifetime and can be handed down to future generations...

well, i have a tube of Ignitionlube (TM) that my father DID give to 
me.  very old. still plenty left.  probably last my lifetime too,  what 
with the advent of electronic ignition on everything from chainsaws 
to Vanagons.  but it is there when i need it.

I can just see it now...my  post funeral estate and will reading.  
Attorney opens a grease stained envelope and pulls out the crinkled 
tube reading   &quot;And to my eldest child I give.....&quot;

SHOOO-WEEE folks.  it Friday!!
