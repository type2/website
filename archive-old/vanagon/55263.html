&gt;This is exactly right.  The heated air from the dash vents was one of the
&gt;enhancements in the 1988 model year vans.

I have an 87 GL, I can get hot air or outside air out of the adjustable
dash vents, yes the air is HOT, not just warm, I have to close the vent it
gets so hot.

The van was purchased in St. Louis, Missouri, the last 6 digits of the VIN
are 060438.
