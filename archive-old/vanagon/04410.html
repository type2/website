Subject: Another Heating system Q.


In stop and go traffic in the summer, the rad fan spends a lot of time on 
and never gets the temp. guage needle down to the verticle position that 
I think of as &quot;comfortable&quot; for my 85.  In an attempt to help the rad out 
a little, I like to turn on the rear heater fan and blow some heat off of 
the coolant that way (all the windows are down anyway, It doesn't really 
heat up the interior too much).
I was wondering if it is possible to, instead of moving the lever which 
cuts off coolant flow from the heater block, to cross wire the fan so 
that it is in effect pulling air out of the cab (like the door vents  :) 
)  taking heat off of the coolant and releasing it to the outside.
Which brings up another Q.  Where does that air come from anyway?
So could that fan be run backwards, or would that screw it up, or are the 
fins/blades curved in such a manner as to make that useless?
I've never had that rear heater open or apart, so I'm not at all familiar 
with what it's connected up like.
If anyone has done work back there and understands what I'm trying to 
acheive, Please let me (everyone perhaps) know.

Thanks in advance.
