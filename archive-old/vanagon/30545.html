Subject: Re: Gas Heater Thermostat

&gt;I have a gas heater in my '71 that looks like a factory installation, 
&gt;but I can't find a manufacturer's name or model # anywhere, so I'm 
&gt;not exactly sure what I have.  It's a grey clyinder about 15&quot; - 
&gt;18&quot; long, and 6&quot; in diameter with a piece of sheet metal 
&gt;across the top that looks to have a reddish orange switch or 
&gt;somthing on it.  There is no thermostat; I just have the 
&gt;&quot;Temp&quot; knob on the dash.  The heater is mounted inside the 
&gt;engine compartment, and it vents to the passenger compartment.  It 
&gt;does not have it's own fuel pump (gets fuel from a T connector from 
&gt;the engine fuel pump), and I'm not aware of any coil to give it spark. 
&gt;It looks entirely self contained.  
&gt;
&gt;My questions are:
&gt;
&gt;A)  What do I have???

sounds like an Eberspacher model BN4

&gt;
&gt;B)  Is there any way to adjust the temperature?

If it is a stock installation, there should be a cable going from the
thermostat control box in the gas heater ductwork (to the left of the gas
tank) to below the front drivers seat (next to the push/pull button that
controls the valve that redirects heat from the main heat tube to the rear
of the bus).  If the cable is there and works, pulling the knob out will
mean more heat, pushing in will reduce temp.

&gt;C)  What is the little orange switch/knob for?

It's a reset switch--works like a circuit breaker.  Use it if your heater
has shut itself down (can occur if the heater is on for awhile and fuel is
pumped, but there is no spark) or if the electrical circuit is shorted
(heater is exposed to some moisture from rain or snow). You use this switch
to reset it once it has been dried or after you find what caused the shutdown.
