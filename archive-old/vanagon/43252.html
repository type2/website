Subject: Re: Syncro Fan!!!

&gt;I'm in need of a cooling fan for a Syncro!  I've posted once and only 
&gt;got 1 response.  HELP we all know how important it is to have proper 
&gt;cooling!
&gt;
&gt;   We had coolig problems wth our syncro, especially in traffic jams in hot
weather.  We found out that the automatic fan switch didn't come on soon
enough, so we installed a manual switch and a water temp guage. The fan is a
2 speed fan, so we put a 3 pole switch in so we can control what speed we
want. I didn' know the fan has a high speed until I installed this switch.
It only came on on low speed when it came on automaticly. It still comes on
automaticly but now I have the option of turning it on when I want(need) to.
