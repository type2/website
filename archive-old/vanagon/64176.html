Subject:      My Experience on FRIGIC /FR-12 from Penzoil

Hi Guys,

I have an 84 westy that is lacking freon.  I talked to my mechanic about
converting it to R134A. He said it would cost about $400 and that in his
opinion was less efficient than freon.

When I saw the link to the Penzoil site I went there to investigate.
The list of sites are distributors.  I finally talked to one here in
Lexington.
He seemed pumped on the product, but only had trucking companies and body
shops using it.
He gave me the number of one of his customers a truck repair company and
said give them a try.  I kept asking why there were no automotive air
conditioning shops were I could get the product. He said FR-12 had not
caught on yet.
So I called the trucking service manager.  He said he had tried it, it
worked well, it had to be recovered like freon, if it was contaminated,
they wouldn't buy it back, so he gave up on it.

Sweatin' in steamy  KY.
