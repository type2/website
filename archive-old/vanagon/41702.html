Subject: Re: Help!: Passing CA smog with a modified VW engine

.  Last time I was inspected 
&gt;they failed me for not having an unleaded restrictor in the fuel filler neck.
&gt;The tailpipe emissions were well within the limits for a '78 engine.
&gt;Ticky-tack.

Last time I checked, leaded regular wasn't even available in California. 
Got to love that bureaucracy...

I grew up in California and having dealt with the idiots at the DMV on many
occasions, it was an experience that I grew loath.

When I bought my bus I was living in Georgia.  I had had it well over a
year before i decided to let the DMV know.  I was expecting the worst and
got it.  After waiting in line for two, maybe three minutes I was told that
since I hadn't registered my vehicle within 90 days, I would have to pay a
fine.  Hmmm, no problem , I'm prepared for that.  It was the magnitude of
the fine that caught me off guard.  Registration cost me $11 instead of $8!
