 I have noticed that the gauge on my 82 sometimes &quot;seems&quot; inaccurate, that
is it follows mileage/consumption for the first half, but on the
&quot;bottom&quot; half the gauge can move around a couple of needle widths, or
even stick at the beginning of the red zone. Maybe the sender arm thingy
needs work, but I'll tackle that when I eventually drop the tank and have
everything cleaned. Until then I rely mainly on the trip odometer, I seem
to get a consistent 360 miles to the tankfull.

(also my fuel pump buzzes when I'm really low, kinda built in warning device)
