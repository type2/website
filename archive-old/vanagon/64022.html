Chris:
You have two oil pressure sensing switches.
The low pressure switch (4.4) must open between 2.2 and 6.5 psi.
It is located between cylinder 3 and 4
The other switch (13.1) must close between 10.9 and 14.8 psi.
It is in the vicinity of the oil pump.
The flashing LED is associated with the 4.4 sensor.
The flashing LED and the buzzer occur with RPM&gt;2000 and no switch closure
from the 13.1 sensor.
A loose connector in the engine compartment gave me the LED/Buzzer
symptom. Follow the wire from the sensor near the water pump. The first
connector you come to is where the corroded connection was.

Drive Safely &amp; Good Luck

&gt;For what it matters, I've been having the exact same problem w/ my '89
&gt;vanagon as several people have been reporting. 
&lt;&lt;snip&gt;&gt;
&gt;Since it's much more infrequent now, I guess I'll live w/ it, but it
sure 
&gt;would be nice to know exactly what's going on.
