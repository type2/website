&gt; Would someone give me a brief description the following so that I may recognize

&gt; 
&gt; Barndoor
&gt; Splitter
&gt; Breadloaf
&gt; Crew Cab
&gt; Single Cab
&gt; Dual Cab
&gt; others?
&gt; 	Check out the Vanagon List Archives.  I think there is a dictionary of bus 
terminology in the Files section. Sorry, I don't remember the URL off-hand.  I'm sure 
you can find it in Yahoo....and I'm sure someone else will post the same information.  
So, I really am just wasting bandwidth here since someone else will give you more info.
			Oh Well!
