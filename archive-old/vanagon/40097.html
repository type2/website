&gt; &gt;Here in San Diego, CA, gasoline has jumped up to $1.50 per gallon

&gt; &gt;HAve other parts of the USA had such a large increase?
&gt; 
&gt; well, not THAT much ... but it jumped from $1.19 to $1.29 in one week for
&gt; regular, and $1.27 to $1.41 for premium. in some places, it's already as
&gt; high as $1.45/gallon for premium. and the tv news folks say it's going higher
&gt; this summer.

      It's more like $1.50 to $1.61 in San Diego. And it's April.
