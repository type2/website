&gt; My question is---am I being too ambitious, biting off more than I can chew?
&gt; Or is the procedure really as uncomplicated as Muir's book paints it out to
&gt; be?
&gt; 
&gt; Also, could anyone tell me a good place to acquire the necessary Phase II
&gt; tools?  Would these be available at any good hardware store or auto supply
&gt; store, or is it going to require a ittle more searching than that.

 Hey Ben,
I think you should just go for it.  It's almost all in the books and it 
seems to make sense as you doing it.  Just take your time and don't drink 
too many beers in the process.  Definitely label everything!!!  Even if 
you wear your fingers down doing it.  Always ask for advise and then make 
up your own mind afterward.  You can sink a lot of money into an engine, 
but the experience is definitely worth it.

  Don't go too cheep on tools, just get the basics and borrow.  Yeah, 
your friends will frown at the idea but they usually give in.  It's just 
that the cheap ones will bend and break on ya and you'll be springing for 
more.  Plus, where would a man be without his tools... &quot;don't leave home 
without them.&quot;

  My brother and I have rebuilt two engines one of them out of a '73 rusty  
This one has 20k on it already and it's still running great. (knock, knock)
We even took about 4 months to do it in and moved the parts many times. 
(bad mistake in the end, but I don't mind visiting the junk yard for 
small stuff)  You'll love it.

 '73 rusty (westy)
