Subject: Westy RV battery question (fire concern)

I have a deep cycle RV battery that I store in a plastic case under the rear
seat of my 87 Westy to power a portable 9&quot; tv/vcr combo.  I just connect the
+ and  - poles to a BASIC DESIGNS12-volt cord (alligator clips and cigarette
type lighter adapter) and then plug in the tv 12-volt cord.  Well I just
tried this with the BASIC DESIGNS power shower and fried the cord!  Nearly
started a fire!  Was this just because the BASIC DESIGNS alligator clips
which connect to the battery are so &quot;wimpy&quot; or is this inherently dangerous?
 I don't want to fry my tv.  Worse I don't want a fire.  Any suggestions? I
try to avoid using the dashboard lighter plug for obvious reasons

Thanks
Craig
