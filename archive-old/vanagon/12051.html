&gt; You used to be able to buy r12 in one litre _at_ liquid bottles
&gt; but the govt. of Canada has disallowed this, I don't know about the
&gt; states, but I assume that it's the same there.

yup.  the only way to get it now without all the necessary 
certifications is in the large 20 lb cylinders, at least it used to 
be but those may have the kybosh put on them now too.  Price:  about 
$200 for the 20 lbs.  the gummint won't let one buy the 12 oz cans of 
freon but you can buy the 20 lb lots... go figure.

BTW, I have about 5 - 12 oz cans of the bad stuff BUT IT'S MINE, ALL 
MINE HA HAHA HA HA HA!!!! ... :)
