Subject: '79 Bust - No power cont.

I posted several questions some time ago about my '79 and its lack of power
and rough idle after it's  warmed up.  Someone told me to check the valve
covers and make sure they're well seated on the heads.  I just replaced the
gaskets so I guess it's possible there's a bad seal.  But (maybe this
belongs under the heading Idiot Factor) not knowing any better I coated the
gaskets with a touch of motor oil before putting the valve covers back on.
I read in Bentley or somewhere that you can put some sealant on the valve
cover side of the gasket but not on the cyl. head side.  Now what?  Should I
pop the valve covers off and wipe them clean or beat myself upside the head
with the old gaskets and order a new set?

I haven't checked the fuel pressure yet, I need to find a pressure gauge.

Feelin' stupid,

Bob J.
