The other car that also uses lug bolts are SAABs.  They went from lug bolts
in the old days, to nuts and studs in the 70's and are back to bolts again
on the 900/9000 series.  Go figure.  BTW my '84 Vanagon has bolts all around.

I always put some copper never-seize on my wheel bolts.  Tends to make it a
little less impossible to remove later.
