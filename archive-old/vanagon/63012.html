Subject:      Re: Well Done!

I too wish to  offer a big &quot;thank you&quot; !!  It's great to be on a list so
well administered, hardly a blip in the transfer too.

Thank you Gerry Skerbitz, Ron Lussier and Christopher Smith.

If it's still accepted, where do I send my donation ?

&gt;It being Friday, I wanted to shine Ron and Chris a little. List admin stuff
&gt;is not too important to anybody but list admins (probably because, well,
&gt;it's dull ;). But I can tell you that these guys took your donations and
&gt;went out and got you the best list processor in the universe, the best SMTP
&gt;server, loaded it into an extremely muscular machine, and gave it its own
&gt;trunk. If this list were a car it would be a Mercedes 6000-series. I envy
&gt;it.
&gt;
&gt;They weren't daunted by Listserv's hairy learning curve, either. My
&gt;compliments.
