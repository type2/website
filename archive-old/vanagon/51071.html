Hey all,
Well, It finally happened.  Today I made it official and bought a 1981
Vanagon Deluxe Westfalia camper from fellow listmember Rick Koller, of
Silver Spring, MD.  It is a BEAUTIFUL camper and cost me $3500.  It is
that nice blue color and everything is in WONDERFUL shape.  

So, now I have to sell my '78 Bus.  See the next post.

Sean :)
