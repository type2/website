Subject: Westy Furnace Suggestion

As I am new to the group, I have probably missed great suggestions in the
past, but here goes-

I have had an '84 and now have a '90 Westy.  I'd love to know some ideas on
incorporating a furnace for those cold roadtrips.  I have kept my eyes out
for a thermostatically-controlled one that I could tap into my existing
propane system, no luck.  Or how about some sort of freestanding unit that is
safe a doesn't require tons of ventilation?  Any suggestions would be greatly
appreciated.  If you could email me directly at ewilcox_at_aol_dot_com because I am
:( temporarily having to unsubscribe from the group, it too would be
appreciated.  Thanks - Eric
