Since we've had threads about mail order stuff, I'll throw my two cents in.

Today I received some stuff I ordered from Wolfsburg West.  My evaluation
of them is that they are reasonably priced, prompt, and when I mailed in
my order, I'd requested that they call me when they got the order and 
when they would ship it out, which they did.

For my '56 bus, I bought:

left and right rocker panels, including the extra little pice for the right
side, behind the cargo door.  The right rocker tkankfully includes
the inner rocker, but why can't they do that on the left side?  They appear
to be the proper guage metail, although the left rocker seems to be a 
little thinner, but that could be my imagination.

hinge carrier, which seems a little rough, especially in the area where the
seal will go.  Maybe thats why.

Outrigger - this is one of the support crossmembers for underneath the bus.
It seems to be the proper thickness, but I'll check when i get it home.

Battery tray - complete with the holes for the support!  
The packaging on the rocker panels could have been better, the long one was 
bent 'cause there wasn't anything 'cept cardboard protecting it.

All in all, this was a good mail order experience.
