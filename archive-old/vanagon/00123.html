&gt; i know for a fact that double sliding doors WERE available for the 1971
&gt; model year ... cause when i bought mine, i *almost* ordered one that way.

 My folks bought a double door bus in '76 with vinyl seats and a bench in
front. I don't remember whether there was a long wait for it but there could
have been. It was off-white. I don't remember looking underneath it but I
would expect it had the extra stiffening panels under the floor. I'm pretty
sure it had a 2.0 litre engine.

Cheers,
        W.
