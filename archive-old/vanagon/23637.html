Subject: waterboxer vs. vanagon

Thanks for the extensive information about waterboxers...very informative
and helpfull.    Yes, the main reason for getting a newer van is to have the
ability to haul more stuff, just as important I want more power.  Having
said that,I don't want to pay large amounts of money (thousands) to keep my
waterboxer alive.  What would you say is a realistic estimate for
maintaining a waterboxer per year? 

I am intrigued by your comment concerning the '82 vanagon. Since the
vanagons were made from '80-'83 ...why the '82?  The air cooled engine in
the '80-83...
is it as reliable as my type I 1600 in my '71?  What problems do they have?
I appreciate your opinion/comments...as well as any others.

Martin
