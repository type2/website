Subject: Re: Color sanding? good/bad?

Jim, I have had a hellava time with the color coat on a 57 vw.  Even with 
1500 grit if you arent careful you will go through.  Also another thing 
that has been a nuisance is solvant bleed thru.  It creates a bunch of 
little pits.  Cant get the damn things out.  I have been using SIKKENs brand
paint (supposed to be about the best).

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Color sanding with 600grit?  The very least you should use
&gt; &gt;on any acrylic product is 1200, 1500 is better.  You will
&gt; &gt;NEVER buff out the scratches created with 600 or even 1000
&gt; &gt;grit.
&gt; 
&gt; I have no reason to doubt you.  It *has* been a few years
&gt; since I did my body and paint work.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Also you MUST use water when using 1200 or 1500 grit.
&gt; 
&gt; No question.  All of this work should be done with as much
&gt; water as possible.  Goes without saying, as I was dumb
&gt; enough to write.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Just a thought.
&gt; 
&gt; Actually, several thoughts, and good ones.
&gt; 
&gt; As I said, it *has* been a few years since I went through
&gt; that process.  I really do not remember which grit I used,
&gt; but I know I had a few runs that I sanded flat before
&gt; proceeding with a finer grit.  But then again, I did not
&gt; have this list back then.  :)
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the tips.
