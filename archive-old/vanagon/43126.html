Subject: Re: Hoo Boy! (Was: Corrado Powered Westy Syncro -


JW&gt;Hey all, 
JW&gt; Wouldn't a Diesel Westy transmisson be geared way too low to implant a 
JW&gt;Corrado motor?  Make it work mighty hard.  If not I'll put one in my 
JW&gt;RADHAUS when the old diesel dies!

Well in fact it would at that in some ways in some ways not, yes it
would
still rev real high to go 65 mph, but boy you would get there quick,
plus
a typically chipped G60 revs to 6500, a tad bit past ye old diesel mark
so although not great for mileage, you would not be really overtaxing
the engine remarkably.  4th is usually a 0.85 overdrive but I'm not sure
of the final on the diesel 4 spd, but still with the new redline and
considering
my Corrado does 3000+ for 70mph, 3500 for 65mph in a Bus would be an
OK thing if you had plenty of power.  The G60 BTW makes best power
and torque from 3000-5500 rpm, aside from supercharger propganda, in
reality you got to have her spooled up pretty high to get the power, and
in that range particularly pulling from 3500-5000 or so its power is
tremendous.
It would be a very worthwhile effort IMHO, and in fact, my mechanic just
took in a meticulous '82 diesel westy, with gas heater and a blown
engine.
HMMMN.
