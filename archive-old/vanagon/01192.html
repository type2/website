Subject: Source required for engine rubber seal

I require the seal that goes around the outside of the engine tin 
between the engine and the engine compartment (body).  The local VW guy 
here in Guelph (Ontario, Canada) wants 90$.  I find this alittle high for 
this peice of foam rubber.  Anyone know where I could get it cheaper or a 
way to substitute?  TIA

My van is a 74 with 1800 dual carbs.
