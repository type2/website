Subject: Approximate Value

1974 bus windowed with two bench seats.  Looks like good condition (not 
cherry), there is some obvious bondo near the base and some rust under 
the sliding door glass.  Automatic.  Cursory check of the undercarriage 
looks rust free.  Is it possible that this may be air-conditioned?  I 
need a ball-park figure to start with.  Thanks for your help.
