Subject: World Wide Day of the Beetle Party


The following letter came in the latest edition of the CVA
Connection:

&quot;June 22 - World-wide Day of the VW Beetle


Beginning in 1995, all of the following June 22 days will be
considered as the &quot;World-Wide Day of the VW Beetle&quot;, a date in
which to celebrate this dear, charming and useful car.

Why June 22nd? Naturally, for on this date, in 1934, a contract
was signed between the German Automobilistic Industry National
Association and Dr. Ferdinand Porsche. By this contract the Eng.
F.h.C. Porsche GmbH sought to develop the Volkswagen, and submit
for consideration the first prototype in 10 months form this day
on. That was the day in which the successful saga of the VW
Beetle began, a day in which everything started. As it is meant
to be a world-wide date, one has to take into consideration the
climatic conditions of the Earth. The climate in June is
convenient int he northern hemisphere, and it is agreeable in the
most part of the southern hemisphere. This speaks in favor of
June 22.

What is intended by this date? It is aimed at having a fixed date
to celebrate the best selling car of the world, the car that was
elected as the Car of the Century, and the car that was chosen by
thousands of admirers to be their prized possession.&quot;



And now on to the party! As most of you probably know, June 22 is
the &quot;birthday&quot; of my '56 Beetle. This Beetle has been special
since birth, in fact its serial number 1226221 contains its
birthday in both US and European format. I was planning on having
a 40th Birthday Party for my bug anyway. Now that June 22 has now
been declared &quot;World-Wide Day of the VW-Beetle&quot;, what better
excuse to have a MAJOR party!

Over the next few months, I will be working with various clubs
and organizations to put together this bash! You are all invited
to come and celebrate this day, June 22nd! More details will
follow.

P.S. I probably will need a little help with this. If you can
volunteer in any fashion, it would be greatly appreciated.
