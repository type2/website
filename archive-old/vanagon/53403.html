Subject: Re: '97 Euro's

Hi Volks,
  I was reading the posts about the '97 Euros.  Good to here that the
dealers are geting repair manuals for them.  I reciently paid a visit to
the VW showroom and had a conversation with a salesman there.  He was quite
helpful.  Showed me the sales specs on it.  Some of the Standard features
include: VR6, Automatic, A/C airbags and ABS.  I asked him about campers
and at first he said he thought that they would be coming from Westfalia.
But after studying the literature it turns out that VW will continue
suppling Winnabago with Eurovans.=P I really would like to see a Full Westy
camper.  Weekenders will be available from Westfalia. Still no real date
set for reintroduction, but he seems to think it will not be too much
longer.  That all I know. Take care.
