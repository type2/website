Subject: PopTop Seal Update 

Well, my wife and I turned our living room into a poptop-seal packing 
facility on Saturday, and sent out the rest of the seals (or at least, 
those that have been paid for so far). The exceptions are two Canadian 
orders (going out tomorrow), and someone with a '78 camper in Milwaukee 
whose name was not on his note. I'd hoped to get the seals out a few days 
sooner, but as part of the lower price I worked out, I had to agree to 
take the order in bulk and split it up myself.  This took longer than I 
thought, and a shortfall of boxes didn't help.  (If your seal was one of 
the last ones Evon and I boxed, you'll know, because your &quot;box&quot; will 
pretty much be random scraps of cardboard haphazardly taped together :)

If you did not reserve a poptop seal, but still want one, e-mail me for 
info. I do have a few extra.  (Again, they're $38 for a complete set, 
compared to about $100 for a West Coast Metric set, and fit all years.)

If you ordered a seal, but have not yet paid for it, please send your 
check soon, as I have already paid for your seal and am holding it for 
you.  

Thanks,
Ron
