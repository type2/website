Subject: coolant advice needed

Hello All,
          Having been exclusively an air-cooled vanagonaut until August '95,
I'm still learning of the vagaries and mysteries of the wasserboxer engine.
My questions to one and all concern changing the coolant. I'm planning on a
yearly regimen for this job and have scanned the archives and technical tips
files and found good descriptions on draining, flushing and bleeding the
system. The method described by James Lu seems very simple but he describes
manipulating big hoses on the left side of the engine. On my syncro the two
main big plastic hoses to and from the radiator are on the passenger side.
Do I disconnect and drain where these two big plastic guys connect to rubber
ones?
         Also since I haven't owned a wasserboxer very long, I don't have a
clue as to how the coolant should appear after sustained use or time. I
syphoned some out of the primary reservoir (not the overflow) and it appears
very clear and blue with a neutral pH ( I used pH indicator strips from my
Lab) Should I leave it alone a little longer or is this a case of a wolf in
sheep's clothing? TIA.
