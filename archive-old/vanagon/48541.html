Subject: I'd like to thank...

I'd like to publically thank my beautiful (at least I think so) '65
bus for carrying my sorry butt all 2800 miles or so from Portland, OR
to Pittsburgh, PA last week.  I knew as I was leaving that one of the
valve seats in cylinder #1 is almost shot, but I absolutely _had_ to
get on the road so I can make it to school here.  Considering this
neglect, it still performed like the champ that it is - I made the
whole trip in a week, while giving myself two to get it done.  So
anyway, thanks a million, and now I'll make good on all those
whispered promises I made to you as we drove across - really.

Which brings me to my next question...  These old busses are pretty
rare around here (actually, extremely rare - I've never seen another
splitty here), and I'm feeling a little lost.  Any local Pittsburghers
(even CMU students like me?) want to drop an email or get together or
something to talk shop?  I'd love to talk to you if you have any old
VW, not just a splitty.
