Subject: Transporterfest and Web site updates

Hi Volks,
  Just dropping everyone a note to say that I just did a big update to the
LiMBO Web Site. For those who have been there before it may look the same
but look closer and you'll see alot more info stuff into those pages.   If
your surfing the Web why not drop in to : http://www.bcn_dot_net/~limbo/    I
also did some link updates.  If you find a link that doesn't work or is
outdated please let me know.  If you would like to have your web site added
to the link page please e-mail me and I'll add it.  All I ask is that you
do the same for LiMBO.  Thanks.
    For those who live in the Northeast, Transporterfest is going to be
held this weekend at the Brookfield Orchards in Brookfield, MA.  Just
minutes from the Mass pike.  I hope to see someone come out.  Take care.

                        Keep on Busin' -Jim
