&gt;&gt;Ummm... I think $750 would be a bare minimum to rebuild his engine.
&gt;&gt;Probably $9-1200, based on my experience, but I guess it depends on your
&gt;&gt;definition of &quot;rebuilt&quot;.  Not counting labor costs, of course, which
&gt;&gt;would be &quot;free&quot; if you do it yourself.
&gt;
&gt;I thought his was a Type 2! Why does it say [T2] at the top? Is there
&gt;something going on I don't know about again?


Didn't Schwarzenegger rip an engine out of a VW with his bare hands, and
light it on fire (a la Bradley) to finally &quot;terminate&quot; the Liquid Metal Man?


Oh... never mind
