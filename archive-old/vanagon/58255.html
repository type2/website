Subject: Bentley EV manual - updated release date
Date: Thu, 10 Apr 1997 11:13:44 -0400

Hi, listers!

I've been gently dogging Bentley for several
years now, calling them from time to time to 
find out when the heck we'll have a Bentley 
manual for the EV.  The date's slid a number
of times.

Around October I called them and they said the
new (and they said, fairly firm) release date was 
to be right around now (April or so).  I was told
they'd been waiting to decide whether to include the
VR6's in the manual, had decided not to, and thus
were planning to go ahead with a comprehensive manual
covering all the 5 cyl EV's (Caravelles to all you
non-US folks).

Called this morning, saying &quot;is it time?&quot;  They said
yup, we have a firm date now (drum roll)

September 1st!  (cymbal crash)

Seems they reconsidered and have decided to include
the 97's after all.  The lady said this really is a firm
release date now.  No announced price yet.

Stay tuned (as it were).  Maybe this time it'll really
happen.
