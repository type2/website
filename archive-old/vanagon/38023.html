&gt;First, moralists will argue right/wrong
&gt;over just about anything but as Socrates stated in  one of his little known
&gt;treatises &quot;The Nature of the German People's Car&quot;:  &quot;moral debate does not
&gt;apply to VWs&quot;.

Wow!

You wouldn't last two rounds with the Cruise Director, but *I* am
impressed. My last spin doctor quit over the fallout from the Statuatory
Incident. You want a job? We'll go on the campaign trail. Or trial,
whichever.

My handlers suggest this slogan:

&quot;Hooper. Jiminy thinks he's a Real Live Boy!&quot;

Whaddya think?
