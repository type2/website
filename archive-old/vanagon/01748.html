&gt;From: RGOLEN_at_umassd_dot_edu

&gt;5. Number of drunks carried at one time

I had four once during my college days...

&gt;6. Number of drunks carried at one time WITHOUT anyone tossing
&gt;their cookies in the van.

Does having one toss their cookies with their head out the window
while doing 60 mph count?

&gt;7. Highest number of people carried in the van

Had 10 one time but I see others have topped that.

&gt;I'm sure we could come up with more!

1. Number of times friends steal it.
2. Number of times friends keep your right foot down on the gas pedal.
3. Number of beer bottles that roll on the floor before cleaning.
