Subject: Thanks - Alloy Wheels 

I'd like to thank everyone who responded to my posting asking
about what people have paid or sold their Vanagon factory
alloy wheels for.

&gt;From your responses I decided to offer $450 for a set of four
without tires.  I'll let you know if I get them for that price.

Thanks everyone.
