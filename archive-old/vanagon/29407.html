&gt; My, how PC.  Who am I to buck this ever-so-benificent trend?

before you get too cute :), Medi-Van runs the largest fleet of vanagons 
in the nation used in the transport of people for medical 
appointments.  it is based in Detroit Lakes, MN and is a VW force to 
matched by none.  they infact snatch up most of the nice vans in MN 
for modification and use in their business.  they show up at vans 'for 
sale' like Sluggworth at a winning Wonka Bar.
