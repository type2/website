Subject: (fwd) Rooftop carrier FS

Seen on the Vancouver forsale newsgroup, thought of the rooftop carrier 
thread from a few weeks ago.  If anyone's interested or has any 
questions, please contact the original poster (Peter Findlay) DIRECTLY, 
not me or the list.  All the usual disclaimers apply, plus a few others 
I've got up my sleeve at the moment...
