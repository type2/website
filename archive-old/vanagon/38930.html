Subject: Re: WOW!  Miracle MPG improvement


&gt;my '87 Westy finally broke the 20 mpg barrier!
&gt;
&gt;previous to my recent head work, i've approached 20 mpg but never 
&gt;actually hit it.  19.8 was the highest i've seen, and that was on a 
&gt;*long* trip.  the last two tankfuls, which are the first two since 
&gt;the engine work, have seen  20.3 and 21.2 mpg on open road trips of over 
&gt;200 miles each.
&gt;
&gt;ever diligent to explain unexplainable phenomenon, i *think* the 
&gt;difference is attributable to:
&gt;	1.  a new thermostat that replaced one that obviously ran cooler
&gt;	2.  decarbonizing and lapping-in of the intake valves
&gt;or maybe
&gt;	3.  Joel sneaking over to my house at night and adding a bit of gas 
&gt;to my tank.
&gt;
I just got a new engine, and my gas mileage is still in the 16.5 to 17.5 mpg
range.  I got new valves and a new thermostat in the deal.

This truly is a miracle.

Perhaps the Coen Bros. can make a sequel to &quot;Fargo&quot; called &quot;Vanagon of the
Cities.&quot;
