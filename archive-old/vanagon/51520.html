&lt;&lt; Please help a poor college student out.
 
 Does it sound like I need a new alternator?  Or could it be that I need a
new
 voltage regulator?  Will a new voltage regulator come with a new (or
rebuilt)
 alternator?  Should I stick with a rebuilt bosch unit if I have to go that
 route, or has anyone had good success with another aftermarket brand?
 
 
 Thank you so much for your help.
 
 If the voltage regulator goes, should the symptoms be overcharging of the
 system?  It appears that my problem is under-charging.  Voltage at battery
 never gets above 12.8 V.

May also be loose belt or bad wire connection..  If alternator is working
properly, it will maintain 13.5 to 14 volts.  Check at terminal on back of
alternator with engine running. Be careful of moving parts.  Low output could
be caused by bad winding or diode in alternator.  This alternator is the same
as used in late Golfs and Jetta's.  It shopuld be available at a FLAPS.
 Going price for econe rebuild is between $85 to $150.  Beck Arnley and Bosch
both carry premium lines with good warranties,(Beck two years with labor
allowance) at fairly reaonable prices.  Although, compared to local rebuilds,
I thinmk you are paying for the warranty.  Any way, never test the alternator
by disconecting the battery with the engine running.  That can ruin it
instantly.
