Subject: The EcoVanagon is finally home!

Hi all! After one year carefully seeking and bothering you guys with questions
my friend Pucho (the Vanagon guru in Puerto Rico) spotted a nice looking 1985
Vanagon GL, for sale. After several days Pucho listened to this radio station
announcing the same van and inmediately he called me, gave me the owner's
phone number and then I contacted him. The owner was asking $3,500 for the
van, that is pretty reasonable for puertorrican standards. Later just by chan-
ce I met the guy in a Boys Scout meeting and he showed me the vanagon. At that
time I didn't have the money to buy it and decided to sell quickly my Mazda
Pick-up truck, but unafortunately I had to wait two months. When I got the
bucks in my hand (much less than $3,500) I called the guy to see if he still
had the van. Surprisingly he said YES! My friend and me went to see the van
again (three hours of driving from San Juan to San German) and found minoral
problems like: the vanagon made a clunk noise when we started it and that the
engine supports were worn out. In the other side, the engine was completely
rebuilt including new heads (by the way the heads were made in Spain and they
have better design and keep the engine more cooler) 6k miles ago. The body is
pretty solid, it doesn't have major dents, the original paint is like new and
the interiors are more than in mint conditions. Everything in the van works.
After two hours of dealing the wife of the owner came and reduced the price
down to $2,300 and I almost died of a heart attack when I heard that. She told
me that the van was brought six years ago from Massachusetts (Hi you all UMASS
fans!)  and showed me the sales' bill and the title. She decided that I should
have the van because they didn't have space and use for the van. After a week
the Vanagon had new engine supports and now it purrs like a cat when I drive
her to work. Since I'm an ecology professor my kids decided to name her the
EcoVanagon. So now in our garage sits my lovely and reliably (not to mention
that she is my relaxing machine when I go camping) 1978 Westfalia and the
1985 EcoVanagon GL, the new member of the family. Oh well, enough is enough,
thank you for your patience and for understanding this VW freak.
             
Saludos!
