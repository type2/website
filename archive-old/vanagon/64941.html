Bill,

Did you try replacing the pressure cap?   Could be that the relief valve is
weak.   Happened to me in exactly that way.

&gt;Took VAnagon to mechanic who leaned it out so I could pass inspection.
&gt;When it came back and the guy shut it off I heard the sounds of coolant
&gt;boiling.  Overflow tank was overflowing!  Turned it back on and checked
&gt;the temp needle.  A little passed center, hot but it's been lots
&gt;hotter.  Heck, the fan wasn't even on.
&gt;So, kept on trucken, but it keeps happening.  'Course when cold the
&gt;overflow tank is dry, so I add water, so it can overflow again...
&gt;
&gt;Think I ought to get my ratio of anti freeze to water back up again?
&gt;
&gt;Now I realize that running leaner means running hotter, but still..
&gt;Also, he advanced the timing further than I had it...
