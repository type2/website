Subject: response summaries (no vw cont)

An observation: Of the two queries I have posted, most responses have come
to my personal e-mail account.
I suspect that many people who ask for info probably also receive many
responses to their personal mailboxes. Unfortunately, some of these topics
are pretty interesting, and may be so to many people on the list. Direct
responses save bandwidth, and that's a GOOD thing, However, it also limits
the good information provided to the list as a whole. 
I would suggest that people post response summaries if they have information
which may shed light on their particular problem; providing it hasn't
already been exposed to the list.
Just a thought.

Pat
