Subject: Westfalias FS Denver CO


Hey wannabussers,  these westfalias struck my interest as being a little
out of the ordinary so I thought that I would post them:

'89 WESTFALIA like new, 30K mi, $12,900. (303)438-1839, (303)421-5283

'88 WESTFALIA Full Camper, 4 spd, 73K, priced to sell $9995 #6083 Dlr.
	(303)601-0664

'86 SYNCRO WESTFALIA, 5 spd, exc. cond. $11,750. (719)742-3808

That last one is someplace named LaVeta, not sure where it is though, but
syncro westfalias for under $12,000 are extremely rare around here.
Unfortunately I have no connections to the aforementioned busses:(
