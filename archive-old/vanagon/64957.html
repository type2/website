1989 Vanagon Carat  $10,995
Silver, still shines. front bumper needs refinishing, (dealer will do
part of deal)
Engine clean &amp; runs great, shifts great(stick)
83,+++ miles. NEW NEW NEW tires! Very NICE tires, the big knobby all
weather type.



I HAD to look at this box and it's gorgeous! The guy said he'd take
my present Vanagon for $3-4000 (also '89, straight GL model) and drop
the price and make my payments $150-160 mo. He sure made it damn
tempting. Im still thinking about it really bad. I want it!!  I'm in
LOVE!
I want the table, I love that! I haven't any use for the seating I
have right now. I could take out the little single seats; have my bed
in back and put my laptop on the table &amp; play games.(my Vannygon is
my 2nd home!) I want all that room!! Oh who knows...if my current bus
roue goes up to 8 hrs. soon it's MINE.
