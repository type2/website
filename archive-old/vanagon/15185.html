Subject: Do I need a new coil????

I was driving home the other night and my '73 Bus started backfiring and
lurching forward instead of accelerating smoothly.  I stopped immediately
(of course) and checked the engine compartment to find wires attached to the
coil smoking and sparking.  I found one wire that had fallen off the coil
and replaced it.  I went to re-start the Bus and the key wouldn't even turn
in the ignition.  

I replaced all the wires running to the coil and tried starting it
again......still couldn't turn the key in the ignition.

I couldn't find any in-line fuses from the coil to the ignition but I
checked the fusebox fuse and it was fine.  

What do you think my problem is?  Is it the coil, the electric part of the
ignition cylinder on the stering wheel, or something else.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!!!! ;-)

Peace,

Mark
