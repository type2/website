&gt;  Hi all, 
&gt;  
&gt;  Looking for a jack for Syncros and others 4WD. I've seen on a brochure
that
&gt;  this model comes in 3 heights, 900, 1200 and 1500mm. I think these jacks
are
&gt;  manufactured in Canada but I'm not sure. 
&gt;  Anybody on the list? I'm looking for addresses, phone/fax numbers and
prices.

This sound a bit like a jack I have called a Hi-Lift Jack.  All the 4x4 parts
in the USA sell them, usually in the 48&quot; (1200mm) size.  They cost about $50
each, but since they are heavy, would cost a lot to ship overseas.  Try
looking in your area under the name Hi-Lift and see if you can locate one.

However, they will not work very well on a Vanagon without an additional
adapter.  The Vanagon bumpers are too weak to lift the van from and are
poorly shaped to fit this jack on.  I had an adapter made to use the Hi-Lift
Jack in the standard Vanagon jacking points.  You slide the adapter into the
jacking hole in the van and then apply the jack to the adapter.  The jack
faces either toward the front or rear of the van, whichever is convenient.

The adapter is made of 1.25&quot; (about 32mm) diameter steel bar, about 15&quot;
(380mm) long.  Welded onto the jack end is a pair of rings to hold the jack
from slipping sideways into the van or off the end of the bar.  Each ring is
made from a disk and has an outside diameter of 2.25&quot; (64mm) and an inside
diameter of 1.25&quot; to match the bar.  The thickness of each ring is about
.375&quot; (10mm).  The end ring is very near the end of the bar, leaving just
enough room to weld the ring to the bar on the end.  The other ring is about
2&quot; (51mm) from the first ring leaving enough room between them for the jack.
 The welds are not placed between the rings, since this would allow a bit of
ramp area for the jact to possibly creep up and over the the ring.

If you don't have any luck with the Hi-Lift name, let me know and I'll bring
do a bit of digging and get you a few names/addresses/phones/faxes here in
the US.

Good luck,
Jim Davis
