Jack:
I would first have the battery tested. Most auto supply stores will do
this for free.
If the starter IS indeed the culprit I would not hesitate to take it out
and operate. This is a rather simple job. Usually the only parts
required are brushes. Clean, lube and reassemble. While I was at it I
would replace the starter pilot bushing in the transmission case.
Good Luck.

when the engine is hot it will not start and has difficulty in turning
over at all. Let it

&gt;I'm told this is the signe of a starter heading south.  At $210 a pop
&gt;for a replacement, I'm not impressed.  Any other possibilities out
&gt;there...like maybe coil?
