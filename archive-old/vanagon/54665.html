Subject: Re: Wheww!!! Have I got gas!!!!!

&gt;Help,
&gt;
&gt;Today i changed the fuel filter on my vanagon.  In the process my clothes
&gt;got covered with gas.  Anybody got any great ways to rid my garments of this
&gt;offending smell.  
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;

Ahhh.. brings back memories.... like laying under my '79 westy in 30 degree
weather  (FULL tank of gas -oh, yeah, that was real smart....) and clamping off
the rubber fuel line in front of the fuel filter in preperation to change the
filter,  and having the fuel line basically disintegrate wherever I put the
clamp...... gee....gas is really COLD when it's pouring all over your face and
arms and soaking down into your clothes....doesn't taste that great either.... I
can remember trying to shove different sized bolts, screwdrivers, or whatever I
could grab, to try to plug the line to no avail... All this as I'm frantically
running around trying to find some sort of leakproof container to catch the gas
streaming out of what was left of the fuel line... finally resorted to dumping
garbage out a Rubbermaid trash can onto the driveway and using the lid to catch
the gas, then dumping it into the trash can. All this was fuzzy as I nearly
blacked out from the fumes...oh, and I also remembered what I had for lunch,
though we won't go into that....

Not fun kids. I nearly got frostbite on my fingers, and my arms and chest were
red for a few weeks and after 2 hours in the shower  - and even using the ol'
tomato paste method, and countless showers after that,  I still stank like a old
gas tank (tried cologne to mask the smell, but it was worse...)

as far as clothes? Well I was so sick of gas fumes, that I just pitched them.
(it was an old work jacket anyway) 
 
2 yrs later there's still a huge black stain on the driveway from the
disaster.....
