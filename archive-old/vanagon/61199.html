Subject: refill viscous....


 ok, it's been awhile since i was able to talk with my friend at
 SDP, so i was able to find out that normally the VC's are not refilled,
 but replaced, but they can be refilled at the factory. here's
 the catch, they have to be in production inorder for SDP to refill.
 as of today, june 10,1997 the factory is not setup to produce VC's
 so right now even SDP is not set up to refill VC's and
 i was told thatthere is a good supply of new VC's in their
 warehouse at the factory, so they may not go back into production
 for so time...

 also i was interested to learn that SDP is not really working with
 VW so much any more...i can tell you that SDP was upset with VW
 that they dumped the VW T3 16'...SDP wanted to continue to produce
 a version of the VW syncro 16' but VW refused to allow them to use
 the VW chassis design...SDP at the time already had an order for
 their version from the soviet union for a few hundred vehicles..
 SDP really felt like they lost out big...

 i was able to see information regarding the Pinzgauer which
 had been one again redesigned and it is really tough...i'll
 take the six wheel drive version...

 when i am able to get more specifics i'll post more...
later
