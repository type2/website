&gt; I was thinking about running a piece of flexible conduit under my bus to 
&gt; allow for the many wires I'll be running for the gauges.  Has anyone done 
&gt; this, or better yet how and where do you run the wires for the gauges?  I 
&gt; saw some stuff called &quot;ENC&quot;, which stands for electrically non conductive 
&gt; conduit.  It was $2.50 for 10 feet.  There are some connectors and such made 
&gt; for this stuff as well.  All in all, it would only cost around 6 bucks to 
&gt; run the length of the bus.  What do you think?

I think I did this and it was a frigging nightmare.  I couldn't find a ten
foot piece of the stuff, so I used three 4-foot pieces and some twist ties 
to hold them together.  I ran the plastic conduit and 4 wires through the
holes in the frame rails and then through a hole in my engine tin.  One of
the dirtiest jobs I have ever done, cause dirt kept falling in my face as I
lay on my back under the bus.  It probably would be a cakewalk if you could
put your bus up on a lift, though.  Goggles are a necessity for this job.
