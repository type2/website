Joel,

You had mentioned a few months back that the Stalling at Idle when cold
problem I am having may be a result of a dirty idle stabilizer valve.

Last night I took a look at it.   It does not appear to have any &quot;guts&quot; to
it.  It has an electrical connector the puts out ~13.00 volts when the car
is on, but the inside of the valve is just a copper tube with a copper
plate with a hole in it.  The copper plate appears to be soldered to the
copper tube.

Also Bently only shows a picture of the &quot;idle stabilizer valve&quot; with no
exploded view/explination or procedures for checking.


SO far I have replaced the temp sensor II, distributor cap, rotor(retimed
according to bently), coolant level sensor and still appear to have the
Stalling problem.

Do you have any comments or suggestions?
Thanks,
Dan
