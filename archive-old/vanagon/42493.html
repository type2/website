Subject: 	Squeaky Clutch Pedal


After putting it off for a couple of months I decided to eliminate the
annoying squeak I was getting every time I pushed down the clutch pedal.
So, as normal, I first checked with the Bentley manual to become familar
with the mechanism and found that the repair would be a piece of cake. 
 Uuh,
maybe not.  What Bentley doesn't explain is how to get at the mechanism. 
 It
would appear that the instrument panel would have to be remove, which I 
have
done, however that then presents the problem of having to remove the brake
fluid reservoir.  Is this in fact the next step, and if so can I assume 
that
the brake lines will have to be bled when the reservoir is bolted back in.

Thanks to any anyone who can help.
