Subject: Oxysensor reset location?
Date: Wed, 27 Apr 94 15:13:00 CDT


Greetings,

I'm a newbie on mailing lists, but here goes:

I have an '87 Vanagon Westfalia Syncro and I need to reset the dashboard 
oxysensor light (LED).   From the FAQ I know that I need to look for a 
 reset switch (small black box w/button) on the speedo cable.
But the FAQ didn't mention where on the cable said box is! Can someone point 
me in the right direction?  Thanks.

Also, what's the best way to establish the selling price for such a beast? 
 The NADA book and the Kelly Blue book vary all across the map on 
price/value?

Are (short concise) &quot;for sale&quot; postings OK in this list?

Thanks in advance.
