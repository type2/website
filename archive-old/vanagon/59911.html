&gt; &gt;&gt; Ron asked:
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;What *is* a GIFI outlet?
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Ground Fault Interuption Circuit (GIFC) Opps, looks like I did the accronym
&gt; &gt;&gt; wrong.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;It is really GFCI or ground fault circuit interrupter.  They can kill
&gt; &gt;power in 1/40th of a second and will &quot;Trip&quot; if there are slight current
&gt; &gt;changes (Or a big one).  Excellent idea.
&gt; 
&gt; Closer, but I still don't think this is an accurate description.  In a
&gt; 3-wire household electrical system, the hot wire and the neutral wire
&gt; are the normal source and sink of the electricity (since it's A/C,
&gt; they take turns as source and sink of current).  The ground wire hangs
&gt; around as a protective path to ground, and it's usually used for
&gt; grounding appliance housings and such.  The ground wire is not
&gt; actually *in* the path of the electricity flow at all.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, your household circuit breakers detect over-currents through the
&gt; hot and neutral wires.  The only way a panel breaker trips on a ground
&gt; fault is if the fault drains enough current through the hot wire to
&gt; throw the breaker, and then only because the over-current is being
&gt; supplied by the hot wire, not because it's being drained to ground.
&gt; 
&gt; But the point of a GFCI outlet is, NO current is ever really supposed
&gt; to drain to ground.  Even a few milliamps to ground could signal that
&gt; something is wrong.  A 20A circuit breaker isn't going to notice when
&gt; a 5A appliance suddenly starts drawing 5.03A and draining 30mA of it
&gt; to ground.  The GFCI outlets have sensors in them that detect even
&gt; very small currents going down the *ground* wire, and trip the
&gt; internal breaker regardless of what's going on with the hot and
&gt; neutral wires.
&gt; 
&gt; -Rodney
Excellent description.  Just hope I don't have to be a ground wire some
day!
