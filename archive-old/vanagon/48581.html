Subject: Re: Use of Tow Dolly to Move a Vanagon

Hi.
I assume you did this by pulling the Vanagon front in front (forward).
I can see two big problems with this method if you tow backwards:
1) incredible fishtailing
2) too mouch centrifugal force on the transmission from going 55 mph
   in reverse (just what Eric Zeno experienced).

if you lift the rear wheels off the ground, you will still have #1 problem.
(I know from experience -- once I tried this and gave up).
