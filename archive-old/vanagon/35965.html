&gt;When the engine is cold, it appears that the right flap is almost closed

&gt;gets longer, the right flap goes up (opening) and the left flap goes down,
&gt;opening the air flow up to the cylinders, while CLOSING OFF THE OPENING TO
&gt;THE
&gt;OIL COOLER!  This bothers me immensely.  Is there air flow here that is not
&gt;obvious? Does the air flow to the oil cooler actually decrease at high temp?
&gt;This is really bugging me. Somebody straighten me out please!

The airflow is actually directed to flow throughthe cooler.  There is a
cutout in the flap for that air.  If you remove the flap, all air will go
through the cylinders and only part of the cooler.
