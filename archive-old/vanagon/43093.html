Hello list members. I'm the proud owner of a just resurrected 74 Camper 
Deluxe. Living in Grimsby Ontario Canada we've had the camper for three 
years but have only just completed (?) a restoration that mainly entailed 
replacement of numerous corroded body parts and a brabrake rebuild. Though 
it hadn't run for ten years the engine is as sweet as a nut after minimal 
attention to leaky muffler and carb syncronisation. I look forward to a 
useful and mutually beneficial time with the list. I have some questions but 
will wait a couple of days to see how the traffic is before posting these.

Trevor Easton 1974 Camper DeLuxe, 1962 Land Rover Series II, 1974 Land Rover 
SIII, pair of Golfs, 1964 Vespa 90SS, 1970 Vespa 200 (now 290) and a ford. 
(Family vehicles)
