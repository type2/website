Subject: Phoenix Bug (Honda)-o-Rama Tomorrow

Phoenix Bug-o-Rama will be held  on Saturday April 13, 1996 (tomorrow) at
Firebird Raceway in Phoenix, AZ. Travel on  I-10 to the Maricopa Road exit.
Proceed about 1/2 mile to the west. Firebird Raceway and Maricopa Road is
located generally in the southeast portion of the Phoenix Metro Area. If
coming from Flagstaff or California take I-10 as if you are going to Tucson
(I-10 East bound). If coming from the south (I-10 Westbound) simply watch
for the exit as you approach the Phoenix metro area. $15.00 entry $5.00
parking  $30 swapspace wich includes one person's admission.

This is the first major &quot;VW&quot; event to include minitrucks and minicars. This
has caused quite a stir in the local scene. Ellis has very little to say
publically other than (1.) The promoter as a wise businessman needs to go
with the market direction in order to survive. (2.) If we sell all of our
parts and cars to foreign interests and exporters then we get what we
deserve. (3.) What goes around comes around (4.) In my opinion, Mixing
minitruck-minicar and VW crowds is like mixing the KKK with a million man
march (5.) Pomona mixes all types of vehicles and is real successful~I hope
this goes well (6.) I'm sorry to see it happen (7.) I see it as a trend and
a sign of the times (8.) Ellis will be at home working on his VW getting
ready for the VW (only) Classic Weekend in June.
