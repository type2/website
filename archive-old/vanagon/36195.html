Subject: Air escaping (?) in '78 Westy

     been going back and forth on whether to sell this bus I bought about a 
     month ago.  In the meantime, been doing work on it here and there.
     
     1) Put alternator in and replaced all the shrouding around the area.
     2) Couple of new hoses that seem to be related to the emissions 
     control:  they run from the engine to a cylinder near the battery in 
     the extreme passenger rear.  One hose hooks on top, one on bottom
     
     3) New cap/rotor/plugs (wires pending)
     4) Extensive brake work at a shop
     
     
     My question: it starts well and sounds fine, 'cept there is a force of 
     air coming out of somewhere from around one of the plugs (number 2, I 
     believe).  It is not from the heater blower (which is off, and missing 
     hoses right now).  It seems to be coming from the top of the engine 
     but I can't trace it.
      
     The plug and wire lacks a seal, could it just be this?  Or might it be 
     a more significant vacuum leak somewhere, or something worse??
     
     '78 Westfalia, 122K, new battery, new fuel pump and filter.
     
     Any input appreciated.
