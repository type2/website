                      RE&gt;&gt;Methyl hydrate (was: CO Emissions...       10/23/95

The problem with Ca emissions testing is it is handled by bureaucracy.  It
therefore suffers all the ills and evils of any other bureaucratic  endeavor. 
(This is not to be misconstrued as a defense of bureaucratic structures!)

In any bureaucratic endeavor, it is taken for granted that the individuals
subject to or implementing the endeavor have no intelligence, no common sense,
no understanding of the fundamental objectives sought, no judgment, can't be
trusted,  and will lie, cheat, and steal.  Initiative and independent thinking
are qualities that are not to be encouraged. (Hence originates the familiar
statement, &quot; I just follow the rules&quot;.)   Therefore:  to foil all of these
humanistic shortfalls, they attempt to cover all situations with hard and fast
rules.  Of course, with all of the infinite possibilities available in life,
it is impossible to have a set of rules sufficiently detailed to cover all
situations and still result in obeying rules of logic and common sense, even
to the extent of obviating the basic objectives that the rules are
&quot;attempting&quot; to obtain.  If individuals attempt to circumvent the rules in
good faith to meet the basic objectives, and are caught, they are obviously
not following the rules, and therefore punishment follows and  more and more
restrictive rules are implemented to quash any attempt at initiative in
solving the real problem, because otherwise, that challenges the
authority/bureaucracy!  Hence we get stupid decisions that waste resources and
frequently fail to meet the basic objectives.   Note that I have not even
attempted to address efficiency in the above. 

(This all leads, I believe to the following attitude - true story, I was
there, I heard this with &quot;mine own ears&quot;. ---- As a very juinor Lt, some
almost 30 years ago, at a govt. sponsored two week course  describing a a
certain procurement discipline, it was repeated pointed out to the class  that
new updated rules were on the way, and some examples were introduced to the
class.  One of the people in the class was a senior civil servant.  Near the
end of the two week class, he asked with obvious exasperation and impatience
in his voice that although these new procedures and rules were fine and should
improve things, &quot;I just want to know when they will be available in a book so
that all I have to do is look it up and not have to think!&quot;    I kid you not!)

This applies to all things bureaucratic, including Govt. procurements, Public
Education, and of course, smog rules.

Sorry about the bandwidth, &quot;venting off&quot;
Harvey
