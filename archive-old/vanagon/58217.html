Subject: RE: running board for Vanagon Westi

I found this about another running board for sale:

*Part: running board step 
*Component: Body 
*Type: Vanagon 
*Year: 1991 
*Person: Cris &lt;bsutton_at_gladstone.uoregon_dot_edu&gt; 
*Description: Running Board (step) that fits under Vanagon's sliding
door. Came with my '91 Westfalia, looks very nice and serves its
purpose. It is attached to the body through the jack brackets; no need
to drill the chassis, etc. Looks to me like an &quot;official&quot; accesory.
Aluminum.

(disclaimer:  I don't know the person...just thought anyone interested
in obtaining one might try contacting the person above)

&gt;&gt;That would be me, and I still have it. The problem is that I haven't had
&gt;&gt;any time to figure out how much this thing costs. It is a high quality
&gt;&gt;part, aluminum. Does anyone else have one of these? Is it a VW part?
&gt;&gt;(looks &quot;official&quot;)
&gt;&gt;The reason I don't want it for my Westie is because it limits clearance
&gt;&gt;if I am in a off-road/camping situation. Also, at 32, I am still able to
&gt;&gt;get into the vehicle without the need of an extra step... :)
&gt;&gt;I will appreciate any suggestions as far as price for this. I do have a
&gt;&gt;couple of pictures of the running board that I would like to put in the
&gt;&gt;net, but have no idea how to do it. (I guess I need a scanner?)
&gt;&gt;Thank you.
&gt;&gt;Cris.
&gt;
&gt;Hi Cris,
&gt;
&gt;haven't seen any responses to you yet wrt price, and i certainly have no
&gt;idea.  am glad to see that you're in OR, as if we can come to a price, i
&gt;will be driving up there in late May, and could avoid shipping.  I think
&gt;i've seen one of these on, and it did look &quot;official,&quot; but i hope not
&gt;*really* expensive.  I do plan to be camping, but not really much off-road.
&gt;Even tho i'm 57 and disabled due to a lung condition, i'm capable of getting
&gt;into my Westi.  Just thought the step might make it a little easier to get
&gt;some of my oxygen equipment up and in, and also be easier for my 14-y/o dog.
&gt;
&gt;So, you don't really need to get a scanned image, unless you think it's in
&gt;your interest  to open it up for bids, maybe.... I imagine someone will know
&gt;what the price range should be.  
&gt;
&gt;btw, i *still* haven't managed to figure out on what website I saw it --
&gt;some kind of classifieds, i think, from a whole list i found once and not
&gt;since.  Can you tell me where it was?
&gt;
&gt;Hoping to hear from you and that we can work out somethng helpful to both of
&gt;us,
&gt;
&gt;Gail
