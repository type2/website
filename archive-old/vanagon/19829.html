Hi!

Since I just went through what you're no doubtedly experiencing right now, I'd
be *more* than happy to send you my 15+K, compiled checklist (and general
rigamarole) on how I approached searching for an aircooled type II (bus).

It's bombastic and not incredibly organized, but it might just help answer some
questions that you're tentative to ask... I probably embarrassed myself already
by doing so for you! Perfect; insight at someone else's expense... the best
kind!! ;-)

Or, if there are enough responses, I could just send it to the list.

Take care,
Scott
Ms. Moneypenny, my '71 Westy
