&gt;     Hello out there, BusBoys, Jim can you hear me.
&gt;     
&gt;     I've been trying to email BusBoys for a while with no response, but
&gt;     my mail isn't bouncing. 
&gt;     
&gt;     Have they got a new email address?
&gt;     
&gt;     If you're listening Boys please email me, it's about my order.
&gt;     
&gt;     cheers,
&gt;     
&gt;     Lee.

I've been trying the same thing about a catalog I ordered.  Since I, too, am
on AOL I can check sent mail and it keeps saying &quot;Mail not yet read&quot;.  Are
you there, Jim?
