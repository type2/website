&gt; The Bentley manual is the best Vanagon manual for doing repair work. It's 
&gt; not cheap, ($65-$85, depending where you get it). They are advertised in the 
&gt; VW mags.

As I've said, these are available for nothing $10-$20 on microfiche if
you are lucky enough to beg borrow or steal a reader, a reasonable
alternative.

&gt;3) What are the best floor mats?

Try the heavy duty rubber one's from the parts place, will last forever.
