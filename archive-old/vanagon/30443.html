Subject: FI computer Eproms

Does anyone know if there would be any benefit to putting a newer 
(90's) eprom in the FI computer in my '87 vanagon?

I would hate to think what it would cost to buy one, but if I could 
borrow a new eprom I could read it in my Eprom programmer, and then 
burn a new eprom with that code in it. I've already pulled the eprom 
in my van and saved the program onto my hard drive on the 486. Maybe 
I should try to run it on the 486. :-) Naw, it would probably make 
the 486 idle too fast or something. 

Later. . . . .. . Brad
