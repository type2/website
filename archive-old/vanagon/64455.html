Subject:      Vanagon on X-Files

Hey all,
Saw a Vanagon on the X-Files last night, I didn't watch the whole show,
just the very beginning.  In the very first scene the camera shows
headlights coming down the road at night, you can tell by the placement
of the parking lights that it's a Vanagon, then it turns the corner and
stops right in front of the camera.  Looked to be air-cooled, as there
was no lower grille and it had round headlights.

Pretty cool!

Also, where is everyone?  My posts seem to be getting through but list
volume seems to be extremely low.

Sean
