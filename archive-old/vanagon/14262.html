&gt; with the air flow meter box on right with a long 2.5&quot; or so copper
&gt; tube routing air over to an elbow off the manifold, standard diesel
&gt; exhaust.  Get ready for impressive results, the last one I helped with

No , no. Go with a Digifant system with the O2 sensor, knock sensor. Keep
the stock intake manifold but use a Dasher exhaust manifold and instead of the
stock airbox, use a K&amp;N conical filter. Don't forget the diesel
oilpump/pickup (or you'll be pumping air not oil with the diesel pan).
If you change the transmission or just the ring and pinion for better
milage and top end, install an adjustable cam sprocket to shift the torque
curve to restore the snappy accel. In the vanagon, you want more low end
torque, it is tiresome to be always winding the motor out to extract the
best performance.
