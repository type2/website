&gt; I saw a Vanagon today on a for sale lot with rocker panels.  It didn't have

&gt; the little Wolfsburg Edition seal (like on my old '89) and wasn't a Carat.
 
&gt; It was a GL, and I could tell by the 7 headrests visible, that it had the 
&gt; traditional seating arrangement like my 93 EV GL.
&gt;  
&gt;  My old '89 Wolfsburg had rocker panels, and it was my understanding that 
&gt; only Wolfsburgs and Carats were available with these trim pieces.  When did

&gt; the GL get them?  

1990 &amp; 1991.

&gt; Also, when I bought my Vanagon they were selling both 
&gt; Carats and Wolfsburgs that were practically the same model.  What was the 
&gt; difference?  I bought the Wolfsburg because I was able to special order it 
&gt; with different options than the standard ones had and that was the only 
&gt; reason I got it instead of a Carat.  What is the difference?

The 1989 Vanagon GL WLE version had unique grey multi-stripe velour
upholstery, a two tone gray &amp; black dash, leather wrapped steering wheel,
unique Star Blue Metalic (or Pastel White) paint &amp; and standard AM/FM
cassette stereo.  Other than that, they are the same model.
