Subject: Re: Gas Caps???

&gt;So harmon seaver says:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Does anyone know of a source for locking gas caps for a '73 bus?
&gt;&gt; 

The locking gas cap for the '73 (&amp; '72 as well) is the same as the one for a
68-Early '72 Bug, Original OEM 211-201-551H (now supered to 803-201-551A I
believe).

We get $19.95 for original German Blau units, but most any parts house will
have an American-made one for probably half that.  We carry the German ones
for the fanatics :)

and thats my cent and a half :)
