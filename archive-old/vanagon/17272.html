Subject:      Re: Directional Signals

On Wed, 10 May 95 Dean Aukes replied to what Lewis Horn said:
&gt;&gt;Has anyone had a problem with the front turn signal(amber) housings
&gt;&gt;filling with water after a heavy rain?  Ours has filled on several
&gt;&gt;occasions causing corrosion of the wires and damage to the bulb socket.
&gt;&gt;Does anyone know if a good after market gasket is made to fill in the
&gt;&gt;small space between the body and the lamp housing?  Thanks!
&gt;
&gt;Lewis,
&gt;Please let me know if someone posts a solution to this directly to you.  I
&gt;have the same problem on my '73.

one quick and very dirty solution is to remove the turn signal lens and
drill a small 1/8&quot; hole in the bottom edge of the lens housing ... to allow
the water to drain out.

note that this does NOT &quot;solve&quot; the problem, but only allows the water to
exit ... so it cuts down on the corrosion.

one solution would be to hit the junkyards and see what you could find, or
buy some tubes of rubber gasket stuff, make a big bead of it around the
back of the housing, let it set up and dry, then put the housing back on.
