&gt; Hello all:
&gt; 
&gt; Started the &quot;Road Hoopty&quot; up this morning (84 VW Vanagon with 110K on it),
&gt; and heard clicking noises. Went round the back and confirmed that it was
&gt; mechanical in nautre and not a loose fitting in the exhaust. It seems to be
&gt; coming from the left side of the engine. So, could it be valves, or push
&gt; rods? Would taking a rubber mallet to it help? Any help would be great.
&gt; 
&gt; thanks
&gt; Matt

        Just drive it, get it hot, it will go away.
