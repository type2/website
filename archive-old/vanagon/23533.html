Bill's reply to WHellmer - 
&gt; I take issue with the following statement from WHellmer_at_aol_dot_com:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; the change in magnetic strength in your alternator
&gt; &gt; does not dissipate horsepower from the engine or produce 
&gt; &gt; signifigant additional &quot;drag&quot; as some seem to believe. it is 
&gt; &gt; important to understand how a bosch alternator functions in 
&gt; &gt; order to further explain.
&gt; 
&gt; The force on a current carrying wire in a magnetic field is proportional
&gt; to both the magnetic field and the current.  I.e. you increase the torque
&gt; of the alternator by drawing more current or by increasing the field. 
Adding
&gt; a load to the alternator increases both.  When the current draw is higher
&gt; you need more force to push the wire through the field and this force must
&gt; come from the engine, slowing it down. 

  [I concurr - Harvey]

The enigne spins the alternator or generator whether or not it is 
charging the battery.  The engines forces turns the mechanical part, it 
doesn't vary based on the electrical characteristics. 

 [I disagree - if the mechanical input was not proportional to the electrical
output, you could then extract more energy than you put in - NINIVA - free
energy!!  - Harvey]

&gt; &gt; 2. how a bosch alternator works:
&gt; &gt; [ generally correct description removed to save space ]
&gt; 
&gt; OK, this is almost exactly how the large generators at your neighborhood
&gt; nuclear power plant work.  If what you say is true, if we could get that
&gt; thing spinning with my 2.0L VW engine, adding the city of Chicago to the 
&gt; output wouldn't significantly load down the engine.  I think I better call
&gt; the DOE!

Sure you could power the city of Chicago for exactly as long as the 12 
volt battery could power the city.  Again the mechanical force needed to 
turn the alternator doesn't vary.  But once the battery is discharged the 
engine will stop without sparks.  

[that's why the alternator is there, to convert mechanical rotational energy
into electrical energy to recharge the energy drawn from the battery - Harvey]

&gt; &gt; now back to the point. the mechanical energy consumed by the rotation of
the
&gt; &gt; alternator does not increase as electrical output increases. your engine
&gt; &gt; cannot tell if the alt is outputting 20 amps or
&gt; &gt; 55 amps. now for those of you theorists who are waiting to drop the
&gt; &gt; &quot;increased resistance to rotation as a result of induction&quot; bomb,
&gt; &gt; this effect would be similar to lightly rubbing your finger against the
fan
&gt; &gt; pully and would definately not be measured in horsepower;
&gt; &gt; inch-ounces perhaps :)
&gt; 
&gt; Lets see:  20A * 12V is 240 Watts which is nearly 1/3 horsepower.  At 60A,
&gt; you get nearly one horsepower.  So, neglecting inefficiencies in your
&gt; alternator, you would need 2/3 hp from your engine to get 40 more amps for
&gt; your stereo.  You do agree that the energy has to come from somewhere,
right?
&gt; And, since the alternator isn't all that efficient, it probably is more 
&gt; like 1.5 or 2 hp.

[Absolutely! Right On! -  Harvey]
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone is not clear on the above, please don't hesitate to ask.  I'm
&gt; pretty confident in my EM theories.  Generally, or alternately ;-)

Your EM theories are not the problem.  Check the mechanical forces 
involved.  The alternator will spin the same rate the engine pushes it 
regardless of whether the battery needs charging or the electrical 
gadgets are running.  If the mechanical spin force is not converted into 
electricity it will dissipate as heat. 

[not quite - that's why a voltage regulator is part of the set-up.  When
electrical load demand is low, the regulator reduces field strength in the
alternator so that the alternator produces less electricity and thus requires
less mechanical rotational energy input(torque) - so although it is true that
the alternator rpm is mechanically tied to engine rpm, alternator torque
demand is a function of electrical load demand.  What changes in the output of
an alternator as a function of it's rpm is the pre-rectified alternating
current FREQUENCY, faster rpm, higher frequency and vice versa.  Since the AC
output is rectivied by 6 internal diodes to yield direct current and the
ripple in this rectified output is smoothed by the battery, the frequency of
the alternator's pre-rectified output  is not of concern (technically there
are some issues of concern, but they are handled via the integral design of
the alternator itself -has to do with inductance and hystersis ). - Harvey]

Of course I could be wrong also... [in this case, 'fraid so -  Harvey]
