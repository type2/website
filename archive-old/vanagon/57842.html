&gt;Lately when I have been running the A/C on my 88 Westy the unit has been
&gt;blowing out bits of a black plastic material that looks like it is from
&gt;some kind of air filter that has been chopped up by the A/C fan.  The
&gt;A/C seems to work OK but I wonder if I should be concerned about this,
&gt;what is goning on, and whether I should have it fixed.

it's not getting  &quot;chopped up&quot;, it's just falling apart. and mine has been
running fine without it for about three years now. the biggest concern i
had was being careful about drinking anything in an open cup while the a/c
was running! :)   i haven't tried to replace the filter cause the a/c housing
is such a pain to lower. and it's VERY heavy. :(

&gt;Also is it possibe to upgrade the A/C on an 88 Westy to run on the new
&gt;(R134?) refigerent? Are there kits available and who should I have do
&gt;it. Hopefully not my VW dealership.  As you may know the A/C on an 88 is
&gt;different, the entire unit is in the rear roof with outlits in the rear
&gt;only (beacuse of the pop-top).

no known kits yet. VWOA claimed they were looking into it, but the price/cost
of the R-12 has dropped back down, so you'll probably be better off money-
wise just getting the original system fixed and recharged. what i've found
over the years is that if you run the system at least 15-20 minutes EVERY
week or ten days, it'll stay lubricated and keep its Freon for a lot lot
longer.
