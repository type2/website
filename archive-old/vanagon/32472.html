Subject: Re: the all euro engine swap

    I have an 82 Volvo GLE (would have been a 264, but Volvo didn't have #'s
    for a few years).  It's the super loaded model with leather, air, heated
    drivers seat, and power everything.

    I traded a 486SX/25 computer worth about $700 at the time for it.  It
    needed brakes, an exhaust leak fixed, and the cams and rockers needed to
    be replaced.  Body and interior were imaculate/perfect except for a
    crack in the grill.

    All the Volvo mechanics quoted me around $12-1500 to do the work.  They
    all said the Volvo V6 had a lubrication problem in the top end and this
    was a common problem at around 100K, but the bottom end was rock solid,
    no one recommended doing the bottom end.  I priced the parts through JC
    Whitney and the cams and rockers were around $700.

    I finally found a mechanic at a shop who offered to do it at his house
    for $650.  He said he would drill out the oil galleries, use a re-ground
    cam/used rockers from the junkyard, and it would last 2-3 years
    depending on how often I changed the oil.  He also said he could get the
    cams out w/out pulling the heads because he cut a hole in the firewall
    and took them out through the cabin.

    My wife drives it mostly, but in the winter we use it for family outings
    and it has about 5K on since the work.  It runs smooth, always starts,
    and I'm impressed (was quite sceptical about buying a Volvo, but the
    wife wanted one and I wouldn't have to work on it).  According to the
    Washinton State Highway Patrol, it will push the car to 82MPH, but I
    don't know for sure, the speedo has a hard stop at 85, but there is
    still plenty of pedal left.

    Short opinionated version:  The Volvo 6 has a tendency to go through
    cams and rockers _at_ around 100K miles.  Bottom end is solid.
    Cams/rockers are expensive.

    BTW, if anyone wants a recomendation on a good Volvo mechanic (Portland,
    OR), let me know; I've got only good things to say about this fellow.

     I have been reading posting here on and off for the past few
    months.  Great stories about engine swapping.  Has anyone considered
    using a Volvo V6.  They had a 2.7-2.8 liter motor in their Volvo 260
    from the late 70's into the late 80's.  There has got to be a pretty
    good supply of them here in the states.  They run on Bosch Jetronic-K
    CIS fuel injection.  I think they were rated at about 125 HP.  The only
    bad thing I can think of about them is that they are actually of
    Renault/Citreon manufacture.  I saw a rusty 260 in the sunday paper for
    about $500  'runs good, but very rusty'

Anyone have any comments on what would be necessary on a conversion like
this?
