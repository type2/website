&gt;&gt; Maximum speed on flat ground? 95mph on I-10 East in Calif.

&gt;Wow!  My top speed of 90 was on a *steep* downhill of I-15, and only for
&gt;an instant.  At that rpm the motor sounded like it was about to fly
&gt;apart.  My top speed on level ground is about 78 mph.  How did you get
&gt;going that fast??  You must be running nitrous and using 275-80-14 tires!!
&gt;Or maybe you have teensy weensy little front wheels?  :) :)

The motor did rev very high and I'll probably never do it again.
I'm running a stock 1700 w/dual carbs and a new 4-speed tranny.
Also, stock 14&quot; rims with Michelin 185SR14 radials. The needle on
the speedo was pointing at the 'H' (as in MPH) when I backed off
the throttle.

&gt;on a more congenial note, that is actually NOT a bad color to have a car
&gt;painted. one, you can ALWAYS find it in the mall parking lot. two, very
&gt;few people will park next to you. three, other cars can see you very well
&gt;on the highway, in all sorts of weather.

That's why school busses are orange and black, very high visibility.

&gt;my sister had a volvo station wagon in that color (factory paint, no less!)
&gt;and, while not being the most attractive shade, it was very practical and
&gt;useful. i would recommend one small change/addition: paint the roof white.
&gt;this seems to make it even more noticeable (while reducing the heat intake
&gt;of the bus).

Mostly stock, the Fiberglass pop-top is sort of a white color, as are 
the bumpers. I painted the rims and hubcaps black, just like the cops'.
