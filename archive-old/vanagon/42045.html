Subject: Dreams for Sale

After many years of threatening to just get rid of all the VWs and buy 
one good one, it's finally happening.  I leave for Connecticut next week 
to pick up an '80 Vanagon Westfalia (am I nuts, or what?).  I realize now 
that I *really* don't have the time (or money) to bring the dreams of 
Splitty restoration to fruition.  Everything in my .sig is for sale.  
E-mail me privately for details or stay tuned to AIRCLDVW for the sale 
notice.  I will continue to drag them in and pass them along ...
