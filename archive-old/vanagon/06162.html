Well, looks like we may have quite a gathering!  About 20
people so far have indicated interest in participating in
the &quot;western&quot; version of this idea.  There are a few wimps
out there, however, who don't seem to like the thrill, risk,
adventure and pure pleasure of severe cold and snow, so I'm
going to begin looking for campsites at slightly &quot;lower&quot;
elevations.....  :(

If you would all just consider wearing extra layers of flannel,
our realities might be limited ONLY by our dreams....
