Subject: RE: What is that thing under the seat?



Many thanks to you all for the help.  Particularly you, Joel.  You seem to keep
coming to my rescue and I keep thinking I should be able to figure these things
out myself but only after you've already explained them.

OK, so now the question moves to what is a good setup for charging batteries
when your plugged into outside power.  Is there an easy one step solution to not
having to run the engine when your parked for more than a day or two?
