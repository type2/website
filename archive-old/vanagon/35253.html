Subject: Re: Why was #820 11 pages?

For anyone who hasn't dealt with uuencoded binary files, the pages that 
look like gibberish is actually a binary file encoded to allow sending 
via e-mail.  If you run it through a decoder (like Wincode) you will get 
a nice clear image.  Hope this didn't cause you all any probs.
