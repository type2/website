Subject: Can vanagon parts list on microfiche be purchased

Does anyone know if VW sells their parts list for any of their cars on
microfiche?  And if they do what dose something like this would cost?  I
know that wiring diagrams, tech bulletins, and manuals are available
through their product service publications.
