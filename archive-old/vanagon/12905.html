Geoff, 

L&amp;T enterprizes in my area has quite a few Westies and they would carry
the captain's chairs Jon is talking about.

If you are desperate, give them a call to see how much they want for them.

610 264 9191 (L&amp;T)


(They do not ship; but do take plastic.  If you decide you want one of
their stuff, let me know, I'll pick the seats up and ship them for you).
