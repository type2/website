That is a little on the low side.

&gt;&gt; One contributing factor might be that it has the wrong tires --
&gt;&gt; 205/70R14 car tires, max load 1400 pounds.  It should have light-truck

I have pirelli 205/70R14s on the '87.  I keep them around 38 psi.

&gt;My '88 w/165k on new engine gets 21-23 hwy, worst case about 19mpg 
&gt;hwy. I don't think tires should make that much of a difference if you 

Same here. '87 with 135K miles.  I consistently get between 20.5 and 21.5
highway mileage.
