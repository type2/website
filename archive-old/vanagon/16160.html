&gt; Ok, folks with Gnatt and Bodega coming up, I can't help but think
&gt; we need to start &quot;considering&quot; what we're interested in doing next.
&gt; This recent post about Baja prompted B. Prunehead to mention that
&gt; a trip there would be fun, which I agree.

Ah yes, Mexico.  But isn't that too long of a drive for a weekend?

&gt; I assume we're talking about something more extensive than crossing
&gt; the line into Tijuana, so need some suggestions for places in Mexico.

I know a nice spot near Ensenada called the Bufadora, which is a place on
the ocean where the surf shoots up through a hole in the rocks about 40
feet high.  Nice for a stop, at least.

There is also a little town between TJ and Ensenada that is famous for
Lobster.  I think it is called Puerto Nuevo.  We went there and got a
complete 1-lb lobster dinner with a margarita for $8.  

These places are not even 100 miles into Mexico, not true &quot;Baja&quot;, but they
are nice places to stop by.  Lots of people here like to go to San Felipe,
which is about 200 miles inside Mexico on the Eastern side of the Baja
Penninsula.  I haven't been there, though.

&gt; 
&gt; Secondly, which months?

Well I don't know about everyone else, but I am going to be short on
vacation hours after GNATT, so the later the better for me.  Early October
maybe?  I think it will still be pretty warm then.
