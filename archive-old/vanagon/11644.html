I'm having some some idle problems on my '87 Westy. After looking through
the archives, I've decided to change the coolant temperature sensor and I have
one on order from Parts Place. I looked in my Bentleys to see where the thing
is and I can't find it! Can anyone tell me where it's located? Any hints
about swapping them?

Thanks in advance!

Jeff

ps - We plan on getting to the East Coast gathering sometime on Saturday
