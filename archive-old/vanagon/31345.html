Has anybody had problems with starters in '92 Eurovan--

I got a rebuilt starter from a rebuilder it had the wrong shaft diameter--
I then went to the VW dealer who got one from VW 
it too was the wrong diameter (loose in the bushing) The dealer is now
frantically looking for a proper one (no help from VW.
