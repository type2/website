Subject: [F] my trip home....

I was undergoing the trip from Portland to Seattle (home), when the front
end basically fell out of my bus around Lacey,WA. I eventually steered the
wheels correctly (thanks to the vanagon list!) and plopped gently onto the
shoulder of I-5. I was lacking most basic tools at this point, so I 
referenced my personal vanagon archives for this feat. I first assumed
that the bearings failed--per RGOLEN, and some others, but that proved 
not to be the case. Upon further inspection, I thought the tires were
suspect --per MANY, MANY posts--but my tires were brand `new' bias-ply,
so I ruled that out.
   Next, I checked my kingpins/linkpins... AH HA! These had fallen out
of their sockets after about 30 years of use! So I was bent upon find-
ing a way to replace these alongside I-5. I referred to a post on the
vanagon archives by VDUBBER_at_AOL_dot_com, that said I could make a 40-ton
kingpin press from chewing gum, paper clips, and normal flora, so I proceeded
to do this, and had the new kingpins successfully in place in no time.
   A couple miles down the road, my tranny went out--no response in ANY
of the gears. I accessed the vanagon files once again, and found a post
by Rusty, that fully explained the proper use of bungee cords on a stubborn
transmission. I then, using this wisdom, went merrily along my way.
   Later, I actually had the bad luck of running out of gas--ARRGH!!!!!
I utilized microfiche that I'd obtained from Joel to fabricate my own
oil rig, using only the rear seat from my `66, some rocks, and the
pitch from the douglas firs along the road. I was soon on my way yet
again.
   Amazing stuff you learn from the vanagon list, huh?
