Subject: 87 GL Power Brake Problem


Hello to all-

I'm a new subscriber and would greatly appreciate any help or advice-

The brake pedal on my 87 GL has started &quot;going to the floor&quot;.  The van has 
no problem stopping, just seems to have lost the power assist.  I've 
verified that there are no fluid brake leaks.  I've checked the &quot;check 
valve&quot; per the Bentley and it checks OK.  When I check the &quot;booster&quot; per the 
Bentley, it does not check OK.  Anybody ever experienced this?  I'd like to 
be sure that it's the booster before disassembling the dash to get to the 
booster.

Thanks-
