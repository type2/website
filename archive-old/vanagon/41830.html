Subject: Abject Apologies/last send

 The so called &quot;Test pro- - -fuel injection was a total screw up.
 I know better so it's just stupid on my part. 

 Now I just got message from a mail demon saying I've been spamming
Dave Goldberg for four hours with &quot;I'm sorry.&quot; That one is out of 
my hands. 

  If any of the rest of you are wounded, I really do apologize.

 Information content:  The screwed post was a procedure for using
 your vom and dwell meter on various sensors etc. in testing out 
 and &quot;tuning&quot; your FI. I straightened it out and sent it off to
 &quot;gsker&quot;_at_lenti - - . re: continued engine troubles&quot;. If he finds it 
 of any use, I'll repost in standard &quot;read&quot;.         west
