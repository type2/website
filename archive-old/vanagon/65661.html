Dennis, et al,

I know that this is not your rule, so I don't expect you to defend it.  I
mean no offense by being tenacious about this, but I am a bit confused.

 Comment: I believe that it is a leap to conclude that a truck tire
          is abused more.  In safety issues, worst case needs to be
          considered, not a trend.

Question: So, if it is a truck tire (i.e. load range &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;,
          etc.) is the maximum weight capacity printed on the tire
          correct (already de-rated), or must I de-rate it?

My vanagon owner's manual describes two tires acceptable for my '84.  One
is a reinforced passenger car tire, so it would not be de-rated.  The other
a truck tire, so it would be (or need to be) de-rated.  However, both have
virtually the same weight capacity as printed on the tire.

Thanks,
Mike
