Subject:       Westy bed hinge fix, dirty spark plug holes

It was warm enough to work on the van today and i found something out 
about bed repair.  the previous owner's son had broken the bed 
plywood by reefing on it when he was opening or closing it.  i 
re-glued the laminate with Elmer's wood glue and clamped it for a 
couple days.  looks good.

BUT, i found out why the kid broke the wood.  the bed wasn't 
folding/unfolding smoothly. the round part of the hinge that glides 
on the hinge base was catching on one of the phillips scew heads 
causing binding (not unlike a certain discomfort from Japanese car 
seats).  the cure was simply to bend the rounded 'cam' of the hinge 
inward so that it doesn't catch the screw head.  i hate to think how 
long the P. O. had lived with it like this (he said 'you have to be 
careful when unfolding it' and did tell me about the broken wood).  
took about 3 minutes to fix.

on an unrelated note, i changed spark plugs and discovered gawd awful 
amounts of crud on the seat of the spark plug hole.  now i know 
they're not easy to see but it ticks me off when mechanics do a plug 
change and leave all that grunge in there.  it was so bad the plug 
gasket on the old plugs wasn't even making full contact with the 
head.  it's sooo nice to pay a professionally trained dealership 
mechanics to do the job 'right' as the P.O. did.  arrrgh.  anyway, 
they cleaned up okay with LOTS of scraping and blasting with 
compressed air.
