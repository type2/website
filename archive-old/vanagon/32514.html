If it's the complete set, I'd think it's very reasonable. If I were you, 
I'd buy it and offer what I don't need to other list members, 
distributing the expense. What years does this include?

I'd buy the fiche for '71 in a heartbeat! And if they'd offered me that 
deal, it'd already be in my hands....of course, I'm an information addict 
as well as a VW addict, so that kindof explains my attitude.

Thanks! Joe
