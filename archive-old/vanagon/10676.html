&gt; I'm about to install a new swing lever shaft and bushings in my '65

&gt; do this I need to ream the bushings to the correct size prior to pressing
&gt; them in.  Brookland's give 0.9449 to 0.9457 in (24 mm?) as specs for the 
&gt; diameter.  My buddy is going to bore the bushings for me on his lathe to
&gt; 0.946 to accomodate the compression of the bushings after installation.  My 
&gt; question is does anyone have an idea how much compression the bushings 
&gt; undergo after pressing them in.  What diameter should the bushings be bored
&gt; to prior to pressing them in.  The other option is to press them in after
&gt; they've been bored conservatively, buy a 24mm ream and hand ream them after
&gt; they have been pressed in.  Any insight would be appreaciated.

Well, I was going to try to take your option #1 approach a few years ago 
and the machine shop/garage I was dealing with advised me against it.  He 
said he could guess the amount of crush required, but ultimately the real 
test was when the bushings are installed and how well the pin aligns with 
the bushings.  I would recommend option #2.  BTW, I found a complete set 
of adjustable reamers at a swap meet for $22.  Although they were old, 
the larger reamers (3/8 to 1&quot;) were barely used.  Good Luck!
