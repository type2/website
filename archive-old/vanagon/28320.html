Subject: Webber Carbs manual

All,

I think I've seen this mentioned before, but since I did not have a Webber
Carb I ignored. My Westy has been converted from FI to Carburation by the
OO(Original Owner) when the brain box died(who knows if it did or not, he is
dead, and wont tell).  He replaced it with a Webber Progressive (that is
all the info I have about it).  What I want is a book for Webber Carbs that I
can use for maintence, dialing in, etc.  All info will be appreciated.


Cheers,

David
