Subject: disk/gopher/ftp

Ok, the disk is up and restored.  My restore was from November 1, 1994, 
so we've lost any changes to the ftp archives since then.  I'll be going 
through and finding out what got lost today and this weekend, and I'll be 
asking people who contributed to do so again.

In rebuilding the archives of the list (which were not lost at all) I cleaned
up the gopher version.  You will find reading messages much cleaner as I got
rid of all the routing information and now I only retain the fields &quot;From &quot;,
&quot;From:&quot;, and &quot;Subject:&quot; from the mail messages.  If there is a critical field
that is not being included there, let me know.  If you need the full text of
the message, you can get it by downloading the month's archive from the ftp
site. 

Thanks for your patience.  Enjoy!
