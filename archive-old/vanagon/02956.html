Hi Vanagon owners,

I've got an 1987 Vanagon GL, Wolfsburg Edition with (almost) all options.
Unfortunately, this Saturday while on the freeway, I think I popped the
engine.   Loss in oil pressure, clanking sound from the right side 
(possibly a collapsed hydraulic lifter under the valve cover?) ...

Or, possibly the engine sucked a valve or thrown a pushrod.   They all sound
the same, to me.  No black smoke, just a terrible clanking sound from the
right side.

It sounds like a rebuilt engine will cost me around $3000, including
installation.   Is this reasonable?   The body and interior of the car
is still in great shape.   Has anyone else had this experience with
their Vanagon?   If it is only a collapsed lifter, then the cost will
be more in the $200-$400 range.

Suggestions?

                                      Thanks,
                                      ~Keith...
