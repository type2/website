Subject: Wiring A 2nd Battery/Isolators

&gt;&gt; DO NOT USE A DUAL BATTERY ISOLATOR ON A VW BUS! Sorry to shout but 
&gt;&gt; this point seems like it needs repeating as the isolator thing keeps
rearing
&gt;&gt; its head up. The reason is that a VW alternator doesn't put out as much 
&gt;&gt; voltage as an American alternator and you therefore shouldn't make it 
&gt;&gt; fight its way through the voltage drop that an dual battery isolator 
&gt;&gt; entails (typically 1 volt).  You can do it, but it will take a long 
&gt;&gt; time to recharge your batteries. It is much smarter and cleaner 
&gt;&gt; to use high current 12 volt operated relays instead.
&gt;         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

&gt;Thats strange.  I ran a simple RV isolator in my notchback for quite a
&gt;while and didn't have any problems.  What gives?  I had a monster stereo
&gt;in it, and ran the stereo of battery #2.

&gt;What would it take to install something like this?  How would it be wired 
&gt;and how would you choose a relay?

&gt;Very interested!

A vw alternator puts out something like 14.4 volts. After the isolator, you
are 
going to get about 13.4 volts. This is a mere 0.8 volts above 
the full charge level of a battery (12.6 volts). No automotive 
designer would try to charge a vehicle battery with such a 
tiny amount of pressure. You can get away with it, sure, but 
why effectively shrink your alternator down to motorcycle size? 

This point is especially important, because a certain percentage
of charging voltage is employed in trying to overcome 
the internal resistance of your battery. Scant charge is left to for 
real charging.

A person with a sedan may not notice this as fast as a camper 
owner because the sedan owener is more prone to drive his car 
and so is charging his battery a lot. A camper owner especially 
is likely to park his car and use his batteries more, so a dual 
battery isolator is an especially questionable tradeoff for any camper.

Put your hand on a dual battery isolator in operation and feel those
huge heat sinks. They are there to dissapate heat. That heat is 
power being wasted needlessly.

I use relays instead. They turn my two batteries on and off at various 
times because of the way I wired them. When the car is running 
both batteries are connected and both are charging. When the key is off
only the deep cycle marine battery is connected. When the key is 
in the start position the automotive battery is switched on to help with
the starting. When I am winching my van out of a mud hole, I have 
the option to switch either battery on or off, depending on which one I 
want to run down and which type of power I want.

Both relays are rated at something like 300 amps. 

I bought them both from the aforementioned Wrangler that I mentioned
in my earlier post.

I realize that 10 people with dual battery isolators are now going to 
logg onto the list and proclaim that they have been using them with 
no problems and that is fine. It is just that if you were going to design 
a system to add a second battery from scratch relays may be a
better choice.
