Subject: '67 Westy Resto from H*ll Update

Was at the bodyshop last night and the '67 bus was getting a wipe down with
&quot;ting&quot; and the grease and shmutz remover. Will wipe it down again and spray
the pearl on the interior and top half tonight. Velvet greenage should go on
(the way this guy works) by first of next week. Will drop the suspension and
detail the appropriate areas in between. The bus looks great at this point~
and is gonna get better... I have a feeling that it just might take more
than a casual afternoon to assemble ;) ~| Phoenix Bug-O-Rama XX Nov.3,4,5 |~
Looks like I will put the thrasher singlecab in the parts swap area (loaded
with UFOs) instead of the '67 in the show area.
