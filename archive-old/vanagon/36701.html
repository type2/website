Subject: Re: 6 cylinders (phooey)

&gt; &quot;I hope people don't judge me based on one example of my behavior,&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; The one example of Steve's behavior I find annoying is his CONTINUOUS
&gt; reference to 6, count them, VI, SIX, &lt;puts on little  girl's voice&gt; SEE --
&gt; ICKS, cylinders. I have always been attracted to the character and
&gt; personality of VW's not their cylinder endowment. More power to ya Stevo
&gt; (Pun intended), but don't think your little plan to encourage cylinder envy
&gt; has gone unnoticed.

Come on boys don;t fight.  We can compromise with a five cylinder engine 
like us EV types have....
