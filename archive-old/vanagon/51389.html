Subject: Re: New Book Examines Volkswagen's Nazi Years 


Ummm...
So...  If I start a small company and get govt. support, then my country's
government commits an atrocity...  People who buy my company's product in
50 years should feel guilt?

I'll bet Chrysler recieved govt. assistance in the early 60s, then the
U.S. pulled that COUGHshitCOUGH in Vietnam...  So...  people who buy
chryslers, now, ought to be considered totally offensive to asians?

No, I'm not saying the Vietnam conflict is similar to the Holocaust of
WWII, but...  I suppose I am saying, &quot;Get a grip on reality&quot; the people
who systematically practiced Genocide in WWII, are all now dead or so
close to it that they can't possibly matter anymore.

I'm sorry to rant to the list with this No VW content crap.
I'll shut up now.


Cheers.
