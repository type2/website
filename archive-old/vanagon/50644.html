&gt;Can anyone tell me if there were any diesel syncros ever made?  I believe the
&gt;diesel Vanagons were last made in about 82' and that syncros began production
&gt;in about 86'. Any thoughts?

as far as i know, the only syncro diesels were the turbo diesel syncros
made by Oettinger, an after-market customizing company in germany.

but the diesels did NOT end in 82 ... that was the last year diesels were
imported into the u.s.  canada and europe and the rest of the world kept
on getting diesels and turbo-diesels all the way through the rest of the
&quot;vanagon years&quot; and into the Eurovans. but the u.s. didn't get them. :(
