So, Jim Bryant wrote:

&quot;I find it's a good practice to subscribe with a slight
variation in mailing address for each magazine, so when
something comes in that you didn't expect, you can tell
where the information was sold.&quot;

Well, I follow this practice as well.  I recently decided
to subscribe to something using the name of my dog, Phoebe.
Now, I'm just waiting for someone to offer her a credit card.
