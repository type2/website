Subject: valves tightening?

Poor Alyce has been in the shop for 2 days (fuel injection nightmare - another
story for another day).  The mechanic said part of the reason she ran rough was
because &quot;the valves tightened up again&quot;.  The valves had just been adjusted 2
weeks ago (by the same person at the same shop).  Has anyone ever heard of
valves tightening up like this on their own?  What causes it?

Thanks!

Tam

'76 Westy (aka Alyce)
