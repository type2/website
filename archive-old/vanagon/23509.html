Reminds me of a news item in the paper not too long ago entitled &quot;Turkey
Shoots Hunter&quot;.  Went something like this:

Joe hunter shoots a nice fat turkey.  He returns to his truck and throws
both the turkey and his weapon in the back seat and drives off.  After a
while, the turkey - which is not quite dead - starts thrashing about and
manages to pull the trigger on the shotgun and shoot the hunter in the 
knee.  Ah, sweet revenge!

Friday after all,

Cheers,
Albrecht
