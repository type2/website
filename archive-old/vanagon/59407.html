thanks pete I was just going to ask about a/c stuff my 89'westie &quot;money
pit&quot; has an A/c problem (along with a bad synchro gear) I was working at
the local toyota dealer and had them charge up the A/C while I was
there. The mech was nice enough to tell to drive it in, I completely
befuddled him when I showed him where the engine was.(He thought it was
strange,have you ever seen or worked on a Toyota van? You cant even
check the oil without 15minutes of preperation)any way he said he could
not even drain the system (to vacuum check the lines). We saw compressor
oil around the compressor clutch (not a good sign) we did not detect any
leaks even with their super-dooper sniffers, but apparently there is
constriction in the line or compressor. Anyway &quot;money pit&quot; is only 48k
old and I have had her 5 days..I hope this is not the shape of things to
come.
