&gt;I am having trouble (potential) with Vroomhilde, the '71 Bus.
&gt;
&gt;When I am lugging the engine, in 3rd or 4th, but even a little 
&gt;in 2nd, I get a pulsing sensation, at about the engine speed.
&gt;It is not a sound that can be heard, but really only felt.
&gt;
&gt;I dont notice any sounds that sound like the tranny, so I
&gt;do suspect the engine. It is terrible in 4th, unless I 
&gt;am coasting downhill.

Engine sound that is felt more than heard,  Need to check main bearings.
 Case is probably shot.  Rod noises are obvious. Mains or worn case give the
sensation you describe.
