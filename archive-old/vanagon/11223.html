&gt;dumb previous owner, who we refer to as &quot;boy blunder&quot; forced a ginormous
&gt;battery into the shelf, probably by jumping up and down on it.  It was
&gt;almost impossible to remove it and alas, there was no handle.  Alice and I

Talk to your local fire department and see if you can borrow their Hurst
tool (Jaws O' life) :0

I know someone who did this before.  When I was a fireman, a co-worker
rear ended someone.  He couldn't get into his engine compartment anymore,
and needed to check his oil, water, etc, so he pried it open with the jaws.
