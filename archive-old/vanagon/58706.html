Subject: No Start/Start - rough running 86

Hi all. A strange problem has evolved with my 86 Westy synro. On Saturday,
which was dry, it started just fine. Sunday when it had been raining a
little overnight and the temp was about 30 F it would not start first thing
in the AM around 7:30. What happened was just a whirrrr whirrr and no sound
of any firing at the engine, but plenty of whiirrrr. At about 11:00 AM I
tried again got a prtail enagage , some attempt to fire, but no start. At
about 1:00 PM tried again, fired right up and ran fine. Went out this AM
and he fired right up. At about 2:00 PM went out and he would not start,
whirrrr whirrrr, we had a Little rain at this time. Tried again about 4:00
PM and got a start but he did not respond to getting any gas well. He
sputtered, finally caught and he seemed to be okay. Is it the barometric
pressure? Or, serioulsy, that little amount of rain could wreak havoc? Let
me know what the assembled multitudes think - I'm puzzled!!! TIA
