Subject: Re: Squeaking suspension

Haven't noticed anything on the rear, but my front left squeaks over 
bumps also. I think the list has covered this as an A-arm bushing 
problem, but more of an annoyance than anything. ie: It is safe to 
ignore it for a while. (which is what I've done.) Haven't noticed any 
extra &quot;play&quot; in the suspension, so I'm not worried.

&gt; Rear:
&gt; The rear suspension squeaks whenever it goes up and down especially at low
&gt; speed over speed bumps. Could it be the shock absorbers? What happens when
&gt; shocks begin to wear out eg do they get harder or softer?
&gt; 
&gt; Front:
&gt; The front also squeaks when going up and down but because of the higher
&gt; pitch and shorter duration I suspect springs rather than shocks. I can get
&gt; this by pushing down on the wheel arch. In comparison the rear is more like
&gt; a long woosh than a quick squeak.
&gt; 
&gt; What is the story on suspension squeaks? Rubber bits? Springs? Shocks?
&gt; Grease needed?
