Subject: Re: Archives

     After trying to access the archives all day yesterday with no success, I
laid it to so many bored people home on New Year's Day clogging the net.  It
is now 5:22 EST a.m. Jan. 2 and I still can't access the archives.  The error
message says, &quot;Too much traffic, try again later.&quot;  I don't buy it.

     Does anyone know what the trouble is?
