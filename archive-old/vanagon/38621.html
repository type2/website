Dennis, your comment &quot;GL-5 or better&quot; implies that GL-5 is a superior 
lubricant compared to GL-4. I thought that the difference was that GL-5 
has additives that may be corrosive to VW syncromesh rings (they are made 
out of brass or some such alloy?). GL-4 is recomended in the VW (and 
BMW325) owner's manual for the transmission,  and GL-5 
for the differential (where applicable).

Have you seen any trannies that have failed syncros and you can attribute 
the failure to GL-5 lubrication?

nit-pickingly yours,

alistair
