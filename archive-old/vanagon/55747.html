Subject: ATTN German &amp; Japanese Listmembers who e-mailed me!

Sorry to post this to the whole list, but this morning I received an e-mail 
from a German individual who wanted info on shipping a floor mat, water 
pump, and Bentley manual to Germany, and a Japanese individual interested 
in a floor mat.  For some reason, when I moved both messages to my File box 
they got destroyed.  
Both messages were in response to my post to the list, so I'm hoping you're 
out there and can e-mail me again.
Thanks,
Ron Salmon
