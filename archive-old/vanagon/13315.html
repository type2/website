Subject: Re: Oil leak problem---help!!!

&gt;while driving my bus today i noticed a significant oil leak over the left
&gt;exhaust manifold.  

Sounds like you have a leaky valve cover gasket.  Check, and replace.

If this is the problems (likely) you have no worries.

Good Luck, and a Happy Road,

Wolf
