So Patrick Walters says:
&gt; 
&gt; I am new '77 Westy owner and I think its lame to ask this question, but
&gt; is there a way to insulate my engine compartment to dampen some of the
&gt; engine noise?

Yeah, turn the ignition key to the &quot;off&quot; position.  (Buddump-bump-crash)

Seriously now....

Make sure you have a good seal for the top access lid as well as around
the window hatch.  After that, you can throw down a carpet, then some
thick comforters.  You might try those foam things that you're suppose
to put on top of your mattress that have those ripple things.  Put it
in so the ripples face down.  They are in the cone shape that tends to
trap noise.

Turn up the stereo?   :)
