&gt; There seems to be an unusually large number of people who are reporting
&gt; gas tank leaks, myself included. From what I can tell it seems that the
&gt; problem is a design defect - not a consumer defect. Has anyone ever
&gt; called the NTSA hotline (1-888-DASH-2-DOT) To see if they would be 
&gt; interested in investigating the problem as a candidate for a recall? 

&gt; Seems like a legitimate concern to me. 

I would agree that it is most definitely a design defect.  The trough
running down the center of the tank is the perfect place for dirt and
water to collect for the purposes of rusting the center of the tank.  Add
me to the list of complainants, should you (or anyone else) choose to
follow up on this.

PS--the wasserboxer head gasket issue should be added to the complaint as
well, even though it doesn't affect my van.
