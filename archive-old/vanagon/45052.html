Subject: 86 Westy Oil , trip summary

We just got back from a 800 mile round trip from New England. Before we left
I put in the 5w 50 oil. It seems to have made a world of difference in the
pressure . The gauge ran about 27 psi the whole trip, even after running at
about 70 mph for 3 0r 4 hours straight. 
     So another round of heartfelt thanks go out to everyone who helped with
tips and suggestions.   Heck I might even start sending you people
postcards......
