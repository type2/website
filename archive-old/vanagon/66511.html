    I second this problem, with the Platinum plug. I have seen to many
    problem with them. Besides, the regular super plugs are only$.65,
    at trak when on sale.

&gt; &gt;Jack,

&gt;   What plugs did you use?
&gt;
&gt;   If you used Platinums that's the direction I'd go after.
&gt;
&gt;    In the years that I've been servicing VW's I've Always stayed away
&gt; from those plugs.  I like the Bosch Supers.  They seem to be a better
&gt; plug.  I'm sure that I may take some heat on this topic, but I CAN'T
&gt; count how many running problems have been fixed by REMOVING the Platinum
&gt; plugs in a customers car and installing the correct heat range Super in
&gt; the vehicle.
