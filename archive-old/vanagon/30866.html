Subject: VW sighting (Field of Dreams)


	Sorry if this is basic information, I just saw Field of Dreams 
today for the first time and Kevin Costner drives around in a red VW 
bus.  I read the book that this movie was based on (Shoeless Joe 
by Ray? Kinsella) a couple of years ago and really liked it, so I never 
watched the movie because I didn't think that I would like it as much.  
All in all I thought it was a pretty good movie.
FWIW,
dave.
