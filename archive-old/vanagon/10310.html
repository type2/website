Al, 75 cents is a bit on the high side me thinks.  At the university 
here you can do it for 15 cents a page if you are willing to do it 
yourself.  Try the microforms room at your friendly local neighborhood
library.  A public library would probably have one.  You might also 
check a university or college in your area as they might be cheaper.
