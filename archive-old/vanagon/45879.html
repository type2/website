but was that axle rusty under that ol' nut.  The nut is still in
pretty hard shape...as I mentioned in my original post, it looks as
though it had been beat off/on the last time [so Clara, I may take you
up on that offer of a new Nut].

getcha nuts here, getcha nuts here.  plenty for everyone.    i tried plabting
them to see if volswagens would sprout, but only one did (it was a 59 nonn
sunroof deluxe!)  The bigger nuts were completely useless.  i was thinking
about watering them with motor oil, but my ecofreaker friends would beat me
over the head with slugs.

but seriously, if you want one...

&gt;Of course, now I am faced with the dilemma of how to coax those brake
drums off...The &quot;beat the back of the tyre with a rubber mallet&quot; trick
that was successful with the front drums had zero effect on these
babies.  I am thinking about having a couple of pieces of curved flat
stock drilled so that I can bolt them onto the drum and hook a two
armed puller under them [I cannot locate a drum puller for the life of
me ....damn disk brakes..the local FLAPS no longer sells drum
pullers].

try banging on the front, back, and all aroung the round with a big METAL
mallet. (with tyre and rim off)  if this doesn't work, i suggest renting a
puller to get the drum off.   try soaking the axle with penetrating oil for a
while though, hoping it will seep all the way through the meeting surface.
  i once renting the kind of puller that screwed in with the lug nuts, and
well, it pulled the lugs right out of their holes, thereby trashing the drum.
