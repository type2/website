Sami-
don't try this until we get the proper rebuttals from the list but 
how about this 'solution' to unclogging an absorption type system:

maybe, just maybe, heating an area of the condensor with a heat gun, 
heat lamp, or judicious use of a propane torch would drive the system 
pressure high in one area and maybe force the blockage thru... kinda 
like passing a kidney stone.

acually, the most effective area to heat would be something low, 
where liquid NH4 would most likely be.  so maybe heat the low part of the 
condensor?  and maybe gently tap-tap-tap on the plumbing whilst 
things are heating?

maybe your fridge just needs the proper sacrifice and blood-letting.  
try gashing your hand on that turned up piece sheet-metal the PO 
mangled when he/she took the fridge out.
