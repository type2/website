Well, I have a couple left over Halon extinguishers. They are almost
exactly the same size as the Kiddie 110 (I have a couple of those also),
but are only rated for 5-B:C.  Weight is about 4 1/2 lbs.  Cost, priceless
since they can no longer be purchased, or recharged.  The extinguisher
says: &quot;Warning: the concentrated agent when applied to fire can pruduce
toxic byproducts.  Avoid inhalation of these materials by evacuateing and
ventalating the area.  Do not use in confined spaces less than 311 cubic
feet per extinguisher.&quot;

So I guess it should be effective in my little engine compartment.  If my
bus has a fire I plan on using the halon, but if I'm helping someone else,
they get the powdered extinguishers.
