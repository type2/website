Subject: Re: '87 Syncro Westy for sale

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Well I hate to do it but I'm afraid that I'm going to have to sell my '87 
&gt; Syncro Westy GL.... :-(((
&gt; 
&gt; It's currently in St. Louis, MO (missed BBTA because of timing conflict with 
&gt; my sisters wedding, it was a tough decision).  I've got an offer for 
&gt; $10,000. Is this fair? or should I hold out for more, the buyer seems 
&gt; especially interested in the syncro (he already has an '88 westy).
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
&gt; 

I find that the selling price goes up or down depending on how urgent you are
to sell your baby.  If you want more money then hold on to it until you get a
reasonable higher offer.  Also, there are not that many Syncros on the road in
the first place.  In any event, I'd definately lean toward the high end blue-book
or even more depending on the demand in you area.
