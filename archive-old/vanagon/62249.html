Never, ever re-use a window seal.  Seems no matter how much silicone or
other sealing agent is used in the installation, that window seal will
always leak, especially windshield seals.  Having made window seals for
Bugs and Buses since 1976, I learned this the hard way when the old/used
seal looked in good shape to re-use.

Vanagon window seals are notoriously expensive.  Hopefully I will be
intro'ing USA-Made varieties in EPDM when all of the dies I'm having made
are finished.  Should be late this summer, early fall.  Projected price
of a Vanagon Windshield Seal (No Chrome Groove) is anticipated at about
$49, but this is subject to change (I have to order 200 pieces at a time
to meet minimum materials requirements at the extruder).  EPDM material
is far superior to the factory rubber and it's not only nice and soft,
but it doesn't rot either.

Besides, I wanna re-seal all my windows on my Westy before the next rains
hit this coming winter and only do it once.

I've never had to use a special sealing agent with my seals.  But it
wouldn't hurt to do it.

&gt;Does this mean that the rubber seal  is not resuseable?
