&gt; Hi,
&gt; I like to know if there is gonna be serious safety implications if I use
&gt; different tire sizes between the front and rear.
&gt;
&gt; I have 215/60 14&quot; at all 4 corners now, I am thinking of putting 215/70
&gt; 14&quot; sport utility tires at the back to improve traction in snow.
&gt; Thinking of the Dunlops Rovers or the Goodyear GS-A tires.
&gt;
&gt; Any advice?
&gt;
