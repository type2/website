Subject:      Email Opinions

This isn't exactly Vanagon related but it is list related (sort of) and it
is also Friday.

I am looking for new email software -  freeware, shareware or $$$ware.  Any
passionate or expert opinions out there?  I have checked some computer mag
reviews but can't seem to decide.

Please spare the list and reply directly to me.

Thanks
