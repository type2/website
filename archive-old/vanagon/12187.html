I haven't tried that yet, but doesn't it look like you could fit a second
tank right behind the original?  If it fits, you would put tees in the
vents, outlet, and filler tube, since both tanks would be on the same
level.  I'd have a muffler shop make the filler tube tee.  A syncro tank
should fit, too, but it might be a little cramped changing the next
starter.
