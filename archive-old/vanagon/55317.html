Subject: Occasional Sticky Lifter 87GL

I am having an hydraulic lifter sticking on the 87GL once a month or so.
I usually does this when cold but will also when started hot. It does it
when cold and had not done it when last turned off, and vice versa when
turned off hot (read warm) and started warm. The guy I bought it from
said it did it ocassionally, but did not until lately, and only very
intermittently. I use synthetic oil w/Prolong and added a little Marvel
Mystery on the last episode and it did help. Any ideas? Can this lifter
damage anything while in the &quot;sticky&quot; mode and tapping around. Otherwise
the Vanagon runs excellent. Any and all ideas and comments appreciated.
Regards
