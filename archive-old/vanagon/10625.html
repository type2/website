Subject: Windshield washer resevoir

     Having recently obtained a new '81 camper and having even more recently 
discovered the location for filling up the windshild washer fluid (in the driver
side doorframe under the carpet), I gave it a try the other day.  (This was not 
on my list of things to check before buying.)  The wipers work fine and the 
fluid comes out as it should, but when I went to fill up the resevoir, I 
discovered that most of the fluid was pouring down the filler tube and from 
there directly through to the ground below.  Is there a seal between the filler 
tube and the tank which has gone bad?  If so, is it easily obtained/replaced?  I
assume that the tank still holds liquid since I am still able to clean the 
windshield.  Any suggestions or advice would be appreciated.  I guess I should 
be thankful - at least all the expensive things work.
