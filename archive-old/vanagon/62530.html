Subject: Re: Thule roof racks for Westie-Help?

     Falconer,
     
     You should call Thule.  I'm sure they have a customer support number 
     on the boxes and will be willing to help you.
     
     What they probably mean is that the gutter mount towers will fit a 
     westy if you buy those seperate gutter brackets.  You will probably 
     have to drill holes in the side of the top to mount those brackets.  
     Should be less than 10$, or so.
     
     I have a yakima system, and I had to drill the sides, but that is the 
     way I wanted it.  I wanted to be able to raise the roof w/out removing 
     the rack.  If this is what you want, you should mount the rack toward 
     the rear, so it is easier to lift the top when weighted.  Measure 
     twice, drill once.  Seal the holes with silicon.  I've been very 
     pleased with my system.
     
     Yakima definitely has a really tall gutter mount that will clear the 
     pop top.  You can always return your Thule rack to REI and exchange it 
     for a Yakima. 
     
     You're right about the folks at REI.  Now, you are an expert.  But, 
     they do have an excellent return policy.  
     
     Good luck.

Just purchased Thule racks for my Westfalia. The parts list says that 
the No. 300 raingutter foot pack fits this vehicle. Too bad I didn't 
open the box at the REI store.  When I opened the box at home it was 
obvious they were too short to clear the roof. I immediatly went out to 
the vehicle to confirm it. Does anybody know what's up?
Anybody have Thule racks that fit the Westie? The folks at the REI store 
don't seem to have a clue. On the other hand maybe I'm not very bright 
either and can't figure out how they are supposed to work.
