Subject: Yokohama Y370's $

Thanks to all who helped identify the Yokahama Y370 tires.  I finally found a
local dealer who can get them and knows what they are.  Unfortunately he
claims they will be U.S.$109.00 each.  That's US, not Cdn.

I tried Discount tires direct, Tire Rack, and Tele Tire.  None carry them.  A
couple of people on the list bought them for about 80.

Does anyone have another source where I can get them at a better price?
 Maybe I need to go to Montreal and get them for $109 Canadian :-| ?
