If anyone has need for speed 2 you can drive the Vanagon Westy!  All you =
do is go to the main setup screen and type &quot;vanagon&quot; then hit race.  It =
is REALLY slow, and the shift points are accurate, except that it has a =
5 speed instead of a 4 speed, 1st gear shifts at 22mph just like mine!  =
It does cool burn outs too.  There are other cars that you can drive =
also.  To get all of the codes go to this page:
