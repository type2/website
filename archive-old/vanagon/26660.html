Okay, I once had 28 passengers in my van...

Anyone had more?


I also once had 89 bundles of 12 phone books each, which completely 
filled the 85 floor to ceiling back to front with only enough room to 
drive and see thru the windshield, and both outside mirrors.

That was not a nice drive.. For me or the van.


Cheers
