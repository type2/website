  OFFICE MEMO          Thank You Washington                   Date:11/14/95

Thanks to our fearless leaders in Washington, I'll be off the list until the
furlough is over. I can deal with an involuntary, unpaid vacation, but they're
depriving me of my vanagon mail, and that _really_ pisses me off.
Hoping to be back soon.
