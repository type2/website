So Dan Houg says:
&gt; 
&gt; Cetin asks:
&gt; &gt; Maybe the more important question is: why waste the propane when you
&gt; &gt; have another source of power that is immediately available and does
&gt; &gt; not tax any other resources (while the engine is on)?  am I missing
&gt; &gt; something?
&gt; &gt; Cetin
&gt; 
&gt; well... the interruption in the cooling cycle by switching between 
&gt; 12v and propane causes a 'lag time' before each respective heating 
&gt; method fully kicks in.  This increases the fridge temps and it seems 
&gt; they are hard to get low again once they've warmed up.  Additionally, 
&gt; being new to a Westy propane fridge, i have mine running continuously 
&gt; just to see how long a tank will last.  So far, i'm at 9 continuous 
&gt; days.  Environmental ethic aside (yeah, which it probably shouldn't 
&gt; be) the cost factor for propane seems negligible ($3 for a total 
&gt; fill-- 3 gallons).  
&gt; 
&gt; i'm doing some 'experimenting' with the condensor fan.  i've hooked 
&gt; it up so that it runs continuously... that really seems to help keep 
&gt; things cooler at low to medium ambient temps.  60's-80's.  at higher 
&gt; ambient temps, having the fan run continuously doesn't seem to change 
&gt; the fridge temp, probably 'cause it would've been running all the 
&gt; time anyway.  haven't had a problem with battery drain, using the van 
&gt; daily. 

I think the VW intended the DC fridge option to conserve propane with
the thinking that users would use the propane for the fridge as well
as the stove.  I think on extended trips, the DC option would come
into play more often.  For short trips it's no big deal.  I would 
presume that they're probably also complying with some safety issue
and are covering there butts too.  I don't see that switching between
the two is going to loose you that much cooling any more than when you
open the fridge to get something out.  The damn thing is so small, you
may as well change it over.  I really haven't worried about the cooling
down aspect when switching between the power sources.  It's cooled down
things quite well on all of my trips.  Nothing was spoiled.  I do prefer
to bring along an ice chest as well just because the fridge is too
small.  Even for weekend trips.  I usually use the switch over option
when I'm driving.  I have enough to worry about and don't want a propane
leak/fire possibility added to the list.

Just my $.02
