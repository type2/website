Subject: flush kit woes
From: kdlewis_at_juno_dot_com (kenneth d lewis)

greetings,

	Has anyone had any luck with those flush kits that require you 
to install a T in the heater hose. 
	 My 86 crewcabs' temp was fine. Then, just for preventive
measures I did the flush kit thing on it and added new coolant. Almost
immediately I noticed the needle in the temp gauge ride at a higher
average  position. Upon removing the radiator and flushing it a ton of
junk came out! 
	Could it be there is something peculiar about the design (HA!) 
of the cooling system that causes flushing, with the conventional
method, to cause more harm than good?  Has anybody had any luck with a
different method?
