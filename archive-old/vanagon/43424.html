Subject: Bike Carrier and Westfalia Roofs-Question

I'm trying to figure out if there is a way to fit a Yakima bike carrier on
top of my 90 Westfalia.  I would like to have the ability to carrier up to
four bikes at a time or two bikes and a canoe.  I realize that it would be
a pain to remove all the carrier hardware everytime you wanted to pop the
top but it may be worth it, if I can carry all this stuff.  I would
appreciate any suggestions on how folks carry this type of gear.  I have a
lot of Yakima hardware from the past and would like to utilize it if
possible.  Is a tailgate carrier a better alternative for bikes?  Or maybe
the trailer hitch type?
