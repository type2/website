Subject: Re: Westy Roof Storage Questions

&gt;&gt;Anyone have suggestions on what might be a good way to keep clothes and
&gt;&gt;equipment dry that one would store on the top storage area just above the
&gt;&gt;driver and passenger of a late model Vanagon (1990 in my case).  Does
&gt;&gt;anyone make a large waterproof bag that would fit that storage area.

&gt; While touring on Vancouver Island B.C. (beautiful place) a couple of years
ago , I saw a Westy go by that appeared to have some sort of luggage in the
top storage area. The luggage fit the space perfectly, as if it were custom
built for that purpose. There were two pieces and they sat side by side.
They were constructed of somthing ridgid like fiberglass and were the same
color as the Vanagon (grey). I always wondered if they were offered as a
option somewhere. Porsche offered custom luggage for the early cars, so it
might be something someone in Germany might do. Unfortunatly the bus was
just driving around the gas station I was at and didn't stop so I couldn't
ask the owner anything about them. Anybody know anything about these?
