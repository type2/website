For whichever two or three of you don't already get the JCWhitney catalogs,
phone 1-312-431-6102 or mail this card today.  This card says Free Subscrip-
tion for one full year, and the code they may ask for is A490.  Tell them
you have a VW bus or Vanagon, even if you don't; that'll prompt them to 
put/keep more VW stuff in the catalog.
