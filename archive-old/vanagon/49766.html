Congratulations on the 50K!   May the next 150K be as uneventful.  Now that
your 50K powertrain warranty is up (sorry!), did you have the dealer check
for the dreaded piston slap, and if so, how did they do it...by ear?

My EV is at 44K and so far so good.  The next thing is to replace the tires.
I've got the orig. Goodyears on there now.  There's still plenty of tread but 
they're noisy.  I'll be checking out the Tire Rack option soon.  Hopefully 
there will be someone around that can do a good balance and install job in my 
area (central Mass.)  What size did you get?  205's or 195's?
