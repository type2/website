Yo,

	Well, night before last I got my new hatch on and aligned, and did some
blocking on various parts of the bus.

	Last night, I did a pre-un-assembly dry run, whihc basically consists 
of making sure all your bolts and screws will come loose when the time comes.
Keeps you from getting stymied at the last minute!

	I also did some work around the front lip of the roof and the frontmost
portion of the roof itself.

	I then blocked out the nose and front doors, and re shot them with
the PPG Prima with my new gun.  It works great!  And the finish on it
makes it real easy to clean up.

	I did put a nice gouge with the sanding block, which I have to get
out now.  Those things just don't do tight spaces.

	What _does_ do tight spaces well is a foam sanding block.  I got some of 
these a while back, which have 80 or so grit on one side and 100/120 on the
other.  Great for getting into tight spots on the bus nose!

	Today, if I can get it in gear, I'll get some more primer and continue
to block out the rest of the bus.

	Anyone have a long range forecast for the Sacramento/California area?
I wanna strip this bus down real bad.  If I can continue my present rate
of progress, I might be able to paint next weekend!

Thom
