Subject: MUGS-LAST CALL/PLEA

Howdy all, The time for printing mugs is very near, but as of yet, I only have
about 20  orders for each of the 3 designs. I have minimums of 36, 48, and 144
mugs to meet for the designs, so I thought I would put out a near-final plea
for orders. I will probably put the order in the next week or so, but at this
point I'm looking at a substantial personal investment which I really don't
want, which will also put off any new t-shirt and sticker printings until I
have cleared out a lot more of the mugs. Anyway, thanks to those who have
ordered, especially a couple big spenders! :)


Ok Gang, I am taking the plunge into the exciting world of coffee mugs. Due to
trying to make everyone happy, I am producing 3 styles- Netvergnu:gen 4 bus
design on either ceramic or plastic insulated travel mugs, and Air Cooled
Search &amp; Rescue Team on styley Ironware mugs. Here's all the information below-
but first a little disclaimer for the many newcomers who may not have heard
about me and my official list merchandise.
  I am in no way a professional merchandiser or printer. I am NOT doing this to
make money. Rather, I'm just a struggling college graduate who loves Busses, as
well as the neat people who drive them. I also like neat bus stuff, like
t-shirts, stickers, and all that stuff. So, over the last couple years, I've
printed and sold t-shirts for the Bus Lists. People send me the orders and
payment, I buy everything, and mail it out. I've never (knock on wood) been
burned by anybody, and in general tend to be very trusting. Anyway, over 100
folks out there in list land have received, and been pleased with my stuff in
the past. So, if anyone has any questions, feel free to ask someone.
  One reason I am mentioning this is that the prices for these mugs are
probably more than you would pay in a store. The main reason is this- I wanted
to get the 3 different designs, so I'm ordering *very* small quantities.
Printed merchandise is pretty cheap when you order 1000 items, or even 200, but
when you order less than 50, it gets expensive... So, please bear that in mind.
I actually have certain minimum orders to fill, otherwise they won't print
them...

OK-here they are:

1. Classic 4-bus Netvergnu:gen ceramic coffee mug. This is the same design as
    the list t-shirt, with front views of all 4 generations of busses. The
    design has 4 colors in the busses, and wraps around the mug. (the front
    views are all side by side, instead of 2 by 2) the words &quot;Netvergnu:gen&quot;
    and the Vanagon_at_Lenti address, and the http://www.type2_dot_com address are
    printed above the design. This is a standard sized, white, ceramic coffee
       cup, nice for home, office, or wherever. I have to sell 144 of these, so
    feel free to order several!!!!

2. Classic 4-bus Netvergnu:gen insulated plastic travel mug. Again, the same
   design as above, but printed on a larger sized, insulated plastic travel
mug,
   with lid. Perfect for taking in the bus without spills on the perfect
   upholstery! :) (another white mug) (min - 48)

3. Air Cooled Search &amp; Rescue Team Ironware coffee mug. This design is the
    basic 4-pointed fireman's cross, with a VW logo in the center. There is
    a line drawing of a Splittie on one leaf, a Beetle on one leaf, and the
    words &quot;Protect&quot; and &quot;Save&quot; on the other 2 leaves. The words &quot;Air Cooled
    Search &amp; Rescue Team&quot; surround the design. The design is red and
    black, on a granite colored (gray with darker and lighter striations)
    ironware standard sized coffee mug. A definate looker...(min 36)

Pricing-
   Designs 1 and 3 cost $7.50 each, plus shipping and handling, for a total
   of $11.50. The travel mugs, number 2, cost a dollar more, due to their
pricing from the printer. Unfortunately most travel mugs aren't available in
quantities less than 144, so they cost a bit more as this is the only place
that will sell in lots of 48. (The reason I'm going with 144 for the first
design is that the artwork is *free* from that company, so it's totally the
best deal for those)


Non-USA orders please note- I need US cash from you, please, well-hidden in the
envelope. I also have to add $4.00 for foreign postage as well...

Ok then, here's how to order:
Send a check or money order payable to Richard Palmer, and an index card with
your name, address, e-mail address, and number and type of mug ordered to:
Richard Palmer
121 - C Park Ave
Raleigh, NC
27605-1832
USA
The costs are again:
Mug 1 - $7.50 + $4.00 s/h = $11.50
Mug 2 - $8.50 + $4.00 s/h = $12.50
Mug 3 - $7.50 + $4.00 s/h = $11.50
Non-USA orders please add $4.00 for foreign postage

I realize this may seem a bit high, but that comes from not ordering thousands
of mugs at a time...
(If anyone is ordering several mugs, like 5 or more, there will probably be a
break on the shipping)
I will leave this offer open until the first of April. At that point, I will
print up the number of orders I have. So, please don't wait. I don't have these
in any kind of stock. I'm going to print them up, in pretty much the quantity
of orders I receive. Please order as soon as possible. I'll put the order in
the first of April, and will then ship them out priority mail as soon as I
receive them.

Ok, I think that's it. I really need to meet those minimums, sp PLEASE help me
out here...
Many thanks to all the folks who already agreed to buy them. Hey, don't forget
I have all those e-mails, so I'll write you if I don't hear from you! (kidding,
of course)
Seriously, though, please start those orders rolling in. If I can't meet the
minimum, I can't afford to order a lot of extras, so I just can't do it.
Ok, Happy Friday!!!
