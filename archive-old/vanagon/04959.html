Subject: Re: Five Year Dream Car Pick



Will Self sez:

&gt; Okay, everyone, I think we should have our own &quot;Five Year Dream Car Pick.

&gt; 3. they had to drive it daily to work, to the 7-11, across the country, and
&gt;       through michigan winters.

Gee, can I still ride my bicycle to work?  If I *have* to drive this car to
work, that would make a big impact on my choice.  (read, need good gas milage)

Hmmm, has to be a new car eh?

Hummer and Unimog are fun choices, I don't know if I could afford to run the
beasts.  That EuroVan Winnebago conversion looks nice and I could afford to
take care of it.  The only problem is the ground clearence, very little.

I would probably pick a nice big 4WD pickup with some kind of camper conversion
in the back, maybe one of those Dodge trucks with the turbo-diesel engine. 
There are campers for pickups that pop-up when you want to use them but stay
folded down for better highway milage. (total cost, about $33,000)

If'n we can choose a used vehicle, I would be sorely tempted to get a
perfect early 60's 23 window deluxe microbus (guess I'm not too original ;-)
I *do* like to travel however and this would make for rather slow trips
to backpack in the Sierras and to go skiing up in Colorado!

Cheers,

 -Dyer
