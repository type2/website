Subject: Re: Late Split VDO Clocks...

     &gt;The VDO (Kenzle) clock.  I took this puppy apart last night.  Some 
     &gt;sand grains were found in the casing.  I got it to werk almost for 
     &gt;about 50% of its &quot;stroke&quot;.  THis is where the ingenuity comes in.  It 
     &gt;appears to me the clock operates via a contact (point) system similar 
     &gt;(visually) to the points in the distributor).  As the clock ticks 
     &gt;along the gap between these &quot;points&quot; lessens until current is 
     &gt;transmitted across the gab to reset a lever (for lack of a better 
     &gt;word) against a tension spring. The lever and spring unit becomes 
     &gt;engaged into a gear which provides the potential energy for the 
     &gt;intricacies of this clock... And the gap closes..
     
     it really is an amazing device until 30 years later the contact points 
     get burnt because you run the thing on 12v instead of 6v which it was 
     designed for :(
     
     solution, run is on 6v that it was designed for, or perhaps add a 
     capacitor accross points the like in the distributor to avoid sparking 
     (burning) at the contacts :)
