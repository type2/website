Subject: placement of list stickers?


I think it would be good if we can decide collectively where to place
the beautiful new stickers.   That way, when passing each other in
opposing freeway lanes at 74 mpg, we'll instant recognize the other
as a list member, rather than get into an accident trying to figure
out where this one member may have decided to put his sticker.  Top
middle of the font window maybe?  Dunno - suggestions welcome -
