Subject: Low mileage 81 Westy for sale

For sale 81 Westy at local vw dealer. Spoke to salesman who told 
me: Beige, 59,000 original miles, pop top with all camping except stove
(looks like it never had one). Smith VW is located in northern Delaware 
near where I live. If anyone would like more info I will try to get over 
to drive/look at it. If interested call Pat Smith at Smith VW (302)
998-0131. $7900.00 Pat says is in great condition in and out and why
would a salesman lie?
Dave 84 westy (same color)
