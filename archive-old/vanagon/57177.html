What do you keep in your bus?  My 1967 VW Riviera Camper has:

 A &quot;monkee hammock&quot; from Fisheries Supply:  Hangs along the side window behind
the driver, perfect for throwing bug spray, toys, maps, anything.

 A tow strap.  Stores in the spare tire well along with the jumper cables.

 A spud gun: Made from PVC pipe, an aerosol can &quot;handle&quot; attachment for a front
grip and a pistol - looking sparker thing for barbecue lighting, it will (with
a small does of the cheapest non-scented hair spray available) launch potatoes
about 200 yards.
