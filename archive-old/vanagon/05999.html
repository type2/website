Subject: Stainless Steel exhaust

Hi everyone.  The exhaust tubing (headers) for the Vanagon
are horrendously expensive ($1400 in Can.), even the muffler is $600!!  This
is unbelievable.  This is what my friend paid for his '88 a year ago at the
VW dealer.  It seems that with the Vanagon, one MUST use VW headers and
mufflers.  At the prices that VW charges for these parts, this is ludicrous.
They should have been stainless steel from the factory given how these pipes
are continually battered by road debris from the wheels.

Does anybody know of a maker of an exhaust system for the vans (mine is a
'90 Syncro) that makes a system from stainless steel?  I am trying to do
some research before I am forced to buy more VW shares!

Any feedback would be appreciated.


Thanks,
Harry.
