Subject: Be careful with your dipstick!

For some unknown reason the dipstick in my 85 sticks in the tube if it
hasn't been removed for a couple of hours.  The first time this
happened, I gave it a good yank and the bottom part of the dipstick
broke off at the upper notch and fell into the motor.  It took a while
but I was finally able to remove the 3 inch piece with a magnet after
unbolting the oil filler pipe from the block.  Some time later I
discovered another broken dipstick that the PO had stashed under the
front seat.
What could cause my dipstick to stick?
