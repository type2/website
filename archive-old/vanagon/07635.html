&gt; &gt;  A simple question for any one with time on their hands...what effect
&gt; &gt;does running a larger tire have on the odometer, speedometer and trip
&gt; &gt;meter? If for example there are 195s instead of 185s on the front wheels would
&gt; &gt;it be necessary
&gt; &gt;to increase the distance travelled and speed by say 18% (the difference
&gt; &gt;betwen 185s and 195s)? I am curious and also looking for an excuse why my
&gt; &gt;mpg is lower than it should be. TIA - DC
&gt; 
&gt; well, this is what my dippy little program puts out.
&gt; assuming we have a 185/70R14 ... it has
&gt; circumference of 76.02 inches, makes 833.50 rev/mile, indicated 60 mph = 60mph
&gt;   (assuming NO speedometer error. ;)
&gt; now, changing only the width of the tire to 195/70R14, we have
&gt; circ. 77.75, 814.94 rev/mile, indicated 60mph = 61.37 mph actual, 2.28% off
&gt; which is not a whole lot off. and, given the normally erroneous low reading
&gt; of most car speedos, it might actually be more correctly indicating the true
&gt; speed.
&gt; if you change the tire again, to 205/70R14, we get
&gt; circ. 79.48, 797.18 rev/mile, or 60mph indicated = 62.73, 4.5% off.
&gt; 
&gt; this is what my calculations indicate. :)

Joel: Thanks :) - so does this mean that I can inflate my mpg figures by
2.3%? 

Just
got back from a 600 mile trip and noticed that cruising above 60mph and
the mpg drops dramatically, below 60 and it goes back up to 21mpg. Now
that the rings have finally &quot;settled&quot;; the engine seems to run well above
65 except for going up big hills and against the wind... DC --
