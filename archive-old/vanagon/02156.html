Subject: Re: da trip ... and things to carry on it



&gt; ham radios would be much better (clearer, longer range, and less bozos on
&gt; the freq), but are much harder for most of us to get, and much more
&gt; expensive. however, like the cellular phone, a couple of 2m-band radios
&gt; could certainly come in handy. :)
 
I for one am working on my Technician's license at the very moment
and plan to have a 2-meter handy-talkie by Christmas.  Perhaps I am
not the only one?
