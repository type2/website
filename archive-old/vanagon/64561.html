Subject:      Crashworthiness JPEGs

Hi All,

Since this seems to be a current topic, I've scanned 2 pix from '94 VW-SA
vanagon brochure.

One is an impact of vanagon against a wall, with those crash test dummy
targets all over the van.  The other shows all the structural beams that
help it stay vanagon shaped.  Any takers for these illicitly scanned images?
Lemme know, about 75K total.  Tim
