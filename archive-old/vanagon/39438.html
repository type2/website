Subject: [68-91] limited slip diff


&gt;Weddle Eng. sells LockRite auto-locking rear diffs for buses, 1968-1991 for
&gt;IRS bus or vanagons.  2 models, #1310/1311, for 2 or 4 spider gears (4 is
&gt;stronger than two) price was $311/$345 (or jobbers prices $264/$293).  I
&gt;think the install costs about the same again.

Cool! Those aspiring to own the bottomless money-pit called the Syncro,
such as myself, take note:

This will get you about 90% of the potential traction of the Syncro
(because a viscous coupling is not capable of transferring full power
forward, it's rare to lose traction under more than two wheels, &amp;c.). For
about $700 installed, Tim sez. A locker is the primary performance upgrade
among serious offroaders, and a 2WD with a locker will out-perform a 4WD
with open diffs under most offroad conditions.

This opens up the possibility of a serious offroad aircooled camper for
about seven hundred dollars (er, not including the Westy you already own).
This is exciting...
