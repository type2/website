Subject: Trans ?, No Rev, HELP needed!


Hello one &amp; all;

My 86' Westy decided it doesn't like to shift into reverse anymore. I've
only had this baby (my 1st water-cooled VW) for a few months, so I'm a bit
apprehensive about making any diagnostic guesses as to it's current
problem. With the engine on and the clutch pedal fully depressed, if I try
to shift into reverse (normally) it grinds gears big time (so I let up
trying to complete the shift). If I forcefully (=fast) shift it into
reverse, it goes into gear with a big thunk! and will subsequently move in
reverse no problem. With the engine off, I can easily shift into gear, and
when I subsequently turn the vehicle on (with clutch depressed) and
then release the clutch it moves in reverse no problem. The &quot;reverse&quot; 
happened all of a sudden (no obvious sounds or pattern of harder
shifting). I've noticed no gradual grinding or problem with the tranny.
I should also note that it is also difficult, but doable (without any gear
grinding), to shift into any of the 4 forward gears. 

I checked the the shift linkage (components in the box on the underside
of the shifter) and connection to the transmission case at the other end.
Nothing seems to be broken, worn, or out of place. So the problem seems to
be in the tranny itself ?

Any comments, suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

I've worked on many a VW in the past, but never a power-assisted, water
cooled VW, and I've always shy'ed away from transmission work. Looks like
I'm going to start. As with my other VW babies, I suppose I'd need to drop
the engine for any internal tranny inspection/repairs. My Bentley and
Haynes will provide a lot of help, unfortunately they don't tell much
about what a worn &quot;part&quot; (a.k.a., gear) looks like or what subtle damage
to look for (hairline cracks ... where most likely). Obvious worn
gear teeth I can easily identify, it's the subtle stuff I'm concerned
about.
