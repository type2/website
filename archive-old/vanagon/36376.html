Subject: Re: split window price?

&gt;&gt;originally from Germany
&gt;(redundant)
apparently the original owner bought the bus in germany, used it in Europe,
then brought it to the US.


&gt;If it was a kombi, it never had interior.  Does it have headliner clips and
&gt;glue remnants
&gt;up on the top?  Then it was a standard.
there are glue remnants.  So I guess it is a std.

&gt;
&gt;&gt;It seems like $2000 is more appropriate, but this bus is really rust free.
&gt;
&gt;Depends.  Whats the body like?  How's it run?  Tranny?  Steering/Suspension?
The body has 3 small dings, about the size of a tennis ball or smaller.
Runs strong, steering is straight - doesn't fight.  
The tranny is a little noisy, quiets a bit after warming up.  When first
driven the tranny/diff howls a bit.

Thanks for the info.

Brian.
