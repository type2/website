&gt;I see you all have been talking about the mildew problem on the pop-tops.
&gt;I posed this question about 2 months ago.  Can you tell me the findings

Funny you should mention that, because I just cleaned my pop top
yesterday. X-14 works great! I did half the roof and ran out of the stuff,
Went to the store, but they didn't have it in stock and I took some
substitute containing bleach. It didn't work at all. So X-14 rules. Don't
forget to hose off all that nasty stuff afterwards, though. It's probably
not too good for the paint.
