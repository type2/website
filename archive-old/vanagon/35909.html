Subject: replacement shock confusion for 87 syncr


hello all,

Because my van is porposing and rolling some I started researching shock 
replacement on my 87 syncro.  I read the recent post about procedures to 
replace, but the syncro rear suspension configuration is different (is the 
front?)(i've just been pricing the shocks--haven't checked Bently for 
procedures yet).

Also,  I searched the 95 archives and found a post that recommended calling 
Burlington _at_ 800-343-3033.  They do have good prices:  $38.98 ea. (local 
FLAPS $69 ea.)  for the rear KYB gas-adjust and will pick up the shipping 
(they do charge $5 HAZMAT shipping).  BUT, the book didn't have a KYB for 
the front.  In reading recent posts and checking the archives, GR2's were 
recommended for the front, but Burlington couldn't confirm this.  Rich _at_ 
Burlington recommended the BOGE for the front, but they cost     ****** 
   $80.25 ea.   *******

Can KYB GR2's be used on the front of an 87 syncro van?

thanks,
Fred Porter
