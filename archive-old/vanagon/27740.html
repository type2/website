Subject: Thanks...

Just a note to thank everyone who responded to my end-play question. The 
end-play on my '71 was way out and everytime I adjusted it near spec, it 
caused a bind which kept the engine from turning. Turns out it was the 
rear main bearing moving back and forth.

Bottom line, for those of you who remember the $50 engine, I'm working on 
the spare now. I'm trying to get the engine together and back into the 
bus for a trip to NC (from Arkansas) next week, so I don't want to try 
splitting a case just yet (a little too far beyond my experience base to 
tackle on such a tight schedule).

I'll keep you all posted. I'm sure to hoot and holler as soon as I'm 
successful. Again, THANKS for your help!

Joe Fournier
