Subject: re:Question re: engine removal

In our 78 Westy, the transaxle is supported by mounts both front and rear so 
it does not need any additional support.  I have found that it is easier 
(IMHO) that it is easier to pull the engine and the transaxle in one unit and 
then seperate them on the garage floor.  This also gives you the chance to 
clean up the transaxle.
It is easier because you can drop the whole works straight down and not fight 
the engine off of the transaxle input shaft or more importantly try to line it 
up when reinstalling.

 I am about to pull the 1700 engine from my 73 so I can overhaul it (inside)
over the winter.

Can someone confirm for me that it is NOT necessary to support the
transaxle with the engine pulled?

In the back of Muir,  I think it says that there is a transaxle support
above the back of the transaxle, but I can't see it.
