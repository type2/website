Subject: Split Case to Tunnel Case Conversion

Ok,

	Here's the deal.

	I have this '56 bus with a split case tranny that works real spiffy
but for one flaw:  reverse is kaput.   

	Let me back up a bit - it works, but pops out, and seems to be getting 
worse as time goes by.

	I would like to upgrade to the later transaxle, but nobody has been
able to give me a good, solid answer on what changes are necesary.  

	I went to Bugformance here in Sac yesterday, to get my window seals,
and I asked the guy about this.  He led me straight to a little adapter
widget (couldn't find the resources definitition) that's s'posed to
do the trick.  I'm a bit suspicious, though, because this little gadget
was only $10.  He hadn't actually done the conversion so he didn't know
if that was what O needed or not...

	I called Bus Boys once and they guy didn't know.  All he wanted to
do was sell me their swing axle kit (to lower it - uggggg!)

	Does anyone have any experience with this?  Is this my bear to 
cross for having the oldest bus around?

Thom
