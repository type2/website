Hi folks,

Speaking of real German fuel hose with reinforced webbing--I was at my 
local VW dealership last weekend to buy some of this and was told that they 
are no longer supplied with this stuff--They did sell me some nice German 
hose made of real beefy rubber that I was content with.  Anyone else heard 
of this change.  I recall buying the webbed hose not too long ago, but I 
don't remember if it was from the dealer or not.
