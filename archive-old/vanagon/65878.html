Subject:      Re: D'OH (metic) fridge

It will take much longer than 2 hours for the fridge to cycle and start
cooling.  You need to fill the fridge to hold the cold.  An empty fridge will
immediatey dump all the cold air upon opening the door.

&gt;The fridge seems to be unable to get lower than 20-degrees cooler than the
outside air. I had it on 110V for 2 hours and all it seemed to be able to
do was hold 70 degrees in the 90 degree temp in the van. Ideas?
