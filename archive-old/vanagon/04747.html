&gt; &gt; I live in a similar neighborhood. Call it the neighborhood of fine 
&gt; &gt; rides.  Not only are scrillion watt systems cool, the coolest thing is to 
&gt; &gt; put small diameter superwide wheels on your shitbox.  

	Well, yeah. Puperty does weird shit to some folks.

&gt; Sorry to further digress from VWs, but I can't get over the 4X4 pickup
&gt; trucks that are lowered to the pavement.  One bag of cement in the bed
&gt; of these things and the muffler hits bottom.  Great idea.  Very
&gt; useful.
&gt; 

	I also live in an area of town (Vancouver WA) that's populated with 
	lots of rigs that thump in the night and their nuts are close to the
	ground. I tell people at work I live in the Heights....White Trash
	Heights :-)

	Yeah, the rigs seem so absured, but I attribute much of it to
	being either poor or there's not much happening at home. So, home is
	their rig, socially. They're sort of extensions of their clothes.

	Most, if not all, people on this distlist are prone to favor function
	and utility and practice that via VW ownership. The thumpers and nuts-
	to-the-ground crowd are pretending they don't have to work. They're
	dressed to party.

	So, when I walk over to the grocery past the thumpers with chrome nuts,
	I just smile at'em. But, I have to confess, there are some late
	nights when a thumper cruises by my crib, I do fantasize a bit about
	positioning myself in my guest room window with a 30-06 and a Ludwig 
	scope and takin' out their tires:-)
