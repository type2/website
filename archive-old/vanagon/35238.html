     Hi there, VW-ites!
     
     I am new to both the listserv and VW ownership.  I bought this camper 
     van for a planned move cross-country, but plans may change 
     dramatically (not due to the purchase, by the way).
     
     The specs:  1978 Type II, air cooled, fuel injection, Westafalia
     
     Good/new stuff:  New fuel pump and lines
                      Tires are all good (I guess less than 5,000 miles) 
                      Spare is spanky new
                      New battery
     
     Engine sounds good, starts fine, runs well; engine seems remarkably 
     good for an 18 year old car; low miles for its age:  122K   
     
     Interior is good, but a bit dirty;  pop-top canvas is good, one small 
     hole in side (about 1/4&quot;), also a bit dirty; cabinet work, etc. in 
     good shape;  recently installed stereo/tape deck; heat transfer boxes 
     in good shape;
     
     Work needed:       Brake work is needed; not sure yet to the extent; 
                        may just need bleeding/cleaning and pads, its been 
                        sitting a while;
     
                        Some rust, most significant around battery tray and 
                        right rear side reflector fixture (no surprise, I 
                        guess); other smaller (1/4&quot; to 1/2&quot; superficial)    
                        cosmetic rust around body; rubber seal around 
                        bottom of camper top is toast (saw one for
                        ?69 in JC Whitney, about ?80 through 
                        West Coast Metric)
     
     Interested??
     
     We're asking for ?1,700.
