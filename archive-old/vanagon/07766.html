Subject: Today's problem: heater fan won't run
Date: Wed, 7 Dec 1994 17:40:36 -0700 (MST)

I know that soon, there simply won't be any more new problems so the
group will have to be happy with re-runs.
Today's problem is this:
I switch on my heater fan motor and nothing happens.
Yesterday, there was an indication of coming events:  I switched it on
and it took a second or so to start running.
As usual, my question is: anyone know where the relay is (if there is one)
that controls this thing.   I have the bentley book and looking at page
97.39,  one sees the indication of a relay.
Oh, no blown fuses .... that's the first thing I checked.  I don't know
though, if that relay were not working it seems that the wipers would
not work either.  But the wipers do work.
Thanks.
