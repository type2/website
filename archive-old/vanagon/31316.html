Good to hear that the MXLs work well in snow;  in case anyone's interested,
don't try going up a dirt and gravel 20+ percent grade...'results in zippo
traction and lotsa blue smoke...   ;-)  

Ahh, where is that Syncro model when you need one...

Oh, BTW, last week there was a thread about recalls on EVs; the following
recall campaigns apply (at least) to stick shift EVs w/ power windows, OK?:

Recall Campaign SW
Recall Campaign SP

One is for the power window regulator and the other is for the improperly
torqued shifter nut.  E-mail me if you want the gory details.
