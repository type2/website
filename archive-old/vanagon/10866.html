I believe the technical term is &quot;Elephant Snot&quot; -- I forget what 
exactly the actual name is, but my buddy who works at Fruehof
went into the local FLAPS and asked for it by that name when
we did the side door seal 5 years ago.  Nary a problem since.
Comes in a tube, maybe a Permatex product.  I'll see if I have
the tube at home, if you need an actual product ID...
