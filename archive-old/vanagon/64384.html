Subject:      Batteries

Well, my current battery is clearly going south.  I remember several people
saying they had adapted the spiral cell gel batteries to fit into the
Vanagon's cramped under seat position.  How is that working out?  I think I
am going to put in two batteries, although there doesn't appear to be any
wiring under my driver's seat.  I am open to suggestions.

TIA
