Subject: Re: stripping the undercarriage

&gt;&gt;Sami,
I spent three weekends (both days) sandblasting the undercarriage of the '67
when it was in a shelled state. I made sure to plug every heater, and shift
tube port etc. I would suggest not to sandblast the torsionbar/spring plate
area too close to the connection between the two. DONT disassemble the area
that I'm mumbling about before you sandblast- I think you'll find sand
between now and dooms day. Do what ever you can cover this area or really
really clean the area afterwords. I had the engine, tranny and the front end
on the other side of the planet when I did this chore. Sand blasting is a
claustrophobic mess but works well. I used 30 grit and tried to be careful.
Make sure to primer the areas right away to prevent rust from starting
again. Ask youself how badly you really want to strip the under carriage
before you get after it. Bottom line is that there is no painless way to do
this. If you find one please tell me about it. Good Luck!


&gt;So I got myself a quart of POR-15 and decided to spend Saturday prepping
&gt;the undercarriage  by removing dirt, loose rust, and the old, crackled,
&gt;layer of tar-based undercoating.
&gt;
&gt;Well, with a plastic scraper, a screwdriver, and a wire-brush, it took me
&gt;3 hours to clean up, oh say... 10% of the area. :( At that rate,I would
&gt;have to spend *every* Saturday for the next 2 months, just to strip all
&gt;that stuff. 
&gt;
&gt;Would anyone know of a better method? Heat? Acid? Sand blasting?
&gt;Vibrating and Shaking? Ultrasound? Driving through the Sahara? Let someone
&gt;else do it?
&gt;
&gt;I'll be glued to the monitor, waiting for an answer. Thanks in advance!!
