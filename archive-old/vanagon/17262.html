Subject:       Re: Fuel Capacity: (was Re: Speaking of Vanagon Shocks)

Hi Drew.  In my '90, the fuel gauge seems calibrated correctly.  I am 
in Canada, and I fill in litres.  I have had it into the red zone, 
and put in 63 litres once (just into the red zone).  The tank is 70 
litres, so I would think that the gauge is accurate.

 
&gt; Here's question for the other Syncro owners.  When my gas gauge reads 
&gt; almost to the bottom of the reserve area, it only takes about 16 gals 
&gt; to fill the tank.
