We've discussed heaters a number of times before, but for those who may 
be new, another option is the Olympian Catalytic heater which runs on 
propane and puts out 6,000 to 8,000 btu's.  I have had and used one for 
several years in N. California. Within a few minutes the entire van is 
toasty. Even in snow at Lake Tahoe it keeps me warm...quite warm. I think 
it was about $300 or so. A result of using it is some condensation on the 
glass inside if cold outside.
