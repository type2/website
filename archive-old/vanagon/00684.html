Sounds to me like a Westy Regrigerator/Flue/etc. FAQ would be a great 
asset for many members of this list. I'm amazed at the similarity of 
problems and the innovative solutions people have come up with. It is 
just so great. I have given up on my frig. until hearing these stories.

Thanks to everyone for thinking it through so far!

James Cook
