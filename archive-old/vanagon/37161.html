Subject: Re: Aurgh! Vanagon climate controls make me mental

Hi Rich.  For the rear heater there is a 3 speed fan switch next to 
the steering column on the right side.  This controls the fan speed 
only.  Under the rear seat there is a valve that you can adjust for 
warm, and warmer air.  It's quite efficient.  Move the lever to the 
front of the van for maximum heat.

Hope this help.
Harry.

&gt; OK, so I have only had my '89 Westie for two days, but you'd think that by 
&gt; now, having read the appropriate section of the manual numerous times, that 
&gt; I'd be able to figure out the convoluted climate controls.  No such luck, so 
&gt; I have a stupid question for those in the know:
&gt; 
&gt; First of all, my Vanagon has A/C but no auxiliary heater.  My question: How 
&gt; the heck do I get heat to come out of vent under the back seat?  The heat up 
&gt; front is just fine thank you, but those sitting in the back are finding 
&gt; their feet to be a bit numb.
