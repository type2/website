Subject: 84 VW Vanagon  $1500
Date: Mon, 29 May 1995 14:43:12 GMT


&gt; 1984 model year
&gt; Water cooled, 2 litre, 4 cylinder engine
&gt; 150,000 miles and still going...
&gt; Next to no rust
&gt; I have owned it for 5 years and brought it to Canada in 1993
&gt; We have bought a newer Toyota van and we don't need two.
&gt; I would rather keep the VW, but my wife wants the Toyota. So,
&gt; its gotta go.

I'll admit that although, it's still runnign the engine is getting 
close to needing some valve work.  Otherwise it's in pretty good 
shape.

As is: $1500

Days: 993-1313
nites:1-613-774-0316
