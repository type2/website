Subject: Sprung driver side door--80 vanagon.

From: Mark Howser &lt;mchowser_at_3rivers_dot_net&gt;

Hey folks,

The chinook winds really did a number on my driver side door.  It is sprung
to the point where it is difficult to close.  I have to slam it hard to get
the latch to catch.  Everybody knows you don't slam VW door and it's making
me sick.  

I tried loosening the hinges that attach the door to forward panel.  Seems
there's really no adjustment or play to help realign with latch.

Anyone fixed this b4?
