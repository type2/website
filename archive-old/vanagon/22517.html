&gt;My father had one made for his early '60s Bus.  I still have it somewhere
&gt;around the side of the house.  It's heavy as hell and reaches way back
&gt;somewhere to be bolted on.  I remember towing a small pop-up camper trailer 

&gt;with it to and from Bif Bend in about '65 or so.  The main 3&quot; x 5/8&quot; part
&gt;of it covered up the drain plug, though, as I recall.  Oil leaked all
&gt;over it when doing an oil change.


If it's still around... wanna sell it?
