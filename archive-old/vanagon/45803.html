Subject: More Syncro Abuse and Mid-Atlantic photos
From: tforhan_at_usa.pipeline_dot_com (Tom Forhan)

I just uploaded a trip report on the Peters Mill Run Trail that Derek and I
ran in our Syncro Westies 
during the Mid-Atlantic Camping trip. Lots of action photos, be patient
with the download.  
 
There is also a group photo of the nine busses that attended the campout.
(Steve Dolan has more photos from the campout that we are waiting to 
see...)
