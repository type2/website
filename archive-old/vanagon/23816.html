Subject: Black junk on left side of engine

I happened to be looking in my '87 vanagon engine compartment yesterday and
noticed what appeared to be black sticky junk splattered on the left side of
my engine compartment. Not alot of the stuff, just enough to be noticable and
of course it caught my attention. Does anyone know what this stuff is and where
it came from? So far my engine appears to be running normally, no bells and
whistles going off in the idiot light/gauge area. Am I worried over nothing, or
is it the dreaded piston-slap/disintegrating solenoid/leaking oil-cooler/head
gasket coolant-leaking-into-the-oil problem?

Many thanks in advance for your thoughts on this subject.
