&gt;
&gt;&gt; Agreed.  You can get a center seat row (short one) out of a Vanagon and
&gt;&gt; mount in the area between the rear and front seats.  The short center seat
&gt;&gt; mounts on rails and can be removed when not in use.  One think to note is
&gt;
&gt;	The center two-passenger seat with the flip-down backrests from the 
&gt;	Weekender work better in this application than the normal center 
&gt;	seat with fixed backrest. I have two of the latter (one is totally 
&gt;	unused) left over from my experimentation with seat configurations 
&gt;	in Flora, our '85 ex-Westfalia.
&gt;
&gt;	I also have the Westfalia's single (swivel) center bucket mounted 
&gt;	in our '86 Jamboree mini-motorhome in the middle behind the driver
&gt;	and passenger captain's chairs...
&gt;
I would love to have one of the flip down backrests, however, I have been
unable to find them.  Normal center seats are readily available for under
$75.  Do you know where I might find the flip down type?

Thanks,
Bo
