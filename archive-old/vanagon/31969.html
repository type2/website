Subject: re: Subarus in VWs ?!!?

&gt; converted diesel vanagons only. You need the diesel trans/bellhousing to 
&gt; mate with the golf/jetta engine. (plus all the parts you mentioned and the 
&gt; exhaust manifold from a Dasher?)  A very doable swap, for the diesels they 
&gt; rev too high, lower gearing. I don't know of a wasserboxer to jetta 
&gt; conversion yet. I like this as it opens up lots of options, 
&gt; turbo/diesel/VR-6!  Tim Smith

Well, I have seen a VR-6 in a Rabbit, so you never know...
I'd be most interested in a turbo diesel, but I think the injection pump 
may not fit, since it is higher than the regular diesel... The TD has 
about the same HP/torque as an 2.0l AFC, so wouldn't be too bad...

I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
