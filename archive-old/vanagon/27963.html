Subject: RE: Shocks for '71 bus


&gt;Anyone know of a cheap shock for the front end of a '71????
&gt;(preferably from sears since they owe me some cash).  I don't care
&gt;about stock, I just want to save my front end.  Any ideas/
&gt;reccomendations?


I bought some of the ones made by Gabriel and marketed by Sears. The red
ones-- sorry, I don't know exactly what Sears called them. They bolted
right on (I shot the old ones with WD-40 and let them sit overnight),
and I had no more front end vibration problems. I recommend them. I
think they were $13 each.
