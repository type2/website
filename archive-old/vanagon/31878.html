Subject: '53 Deluxe for sale

Hi All,

  I'm putting this msg out for Tom Brouillette who's the editor for the
NEATO NEWSLETTER. Many of you may already know his stories of his beloved
&quot;April.&quot; Those of you who don't, then ask. He'd be happy to tell you.

  Anyway, if you're interested, please email him directly. His address is
located at the end of this message.

'53 Deluxe. Oldest and best preserved in the world. Has been restored. ZERO
rust and 99% complete. The 25HP engine is not the original but the engine
was made within one month of the van. His price, $28,000.00 OR he would be
interested in trading for a Eurovan Westfalia.

As I said, email him directly.
