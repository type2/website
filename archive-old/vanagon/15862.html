&gt; I was wondering if there are any other road trippers without money out
&gt; there?  If there are, where do you camp for the night while you are on the
&gt; road?  Rest Stops?  How much is a state park per night out west?  How much
&gt; are national parks?  Are there any other options?  Can I write anything but
&gt; questions?
&gt; 
Just to add my bit about sleeping on the road, I highly recommend truck
stops. Most of them even have a separate area for cars, so you're not
lost in a sea of semi's. There you also can get gas in the morning, have
a shower for a buck or two, and usually get a hot meal. 
As an alternative, you can also sleep in hotel parking lots, as long as
you leave fairly early in the morning...
I've slept in all the above, and also rest stops, all in a brightly
painted '67 &quot;hippie-mobile&quot;, and never really been hassled too badly.
