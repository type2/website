&lt;&lt; Hi Folks,
 
 Thanks for all the advice on my waterpump replacement. 
 There was a lot of good information. I think I will get the dealer to do it
 since it is a tight fit and I dont have a lot of metric tools yet.
 
 
 Thank Again &gt;&gt;
It will cost a lot less to buy whatever tools you need than having the dealer
do it.  You will also be prepared to do this and so much more in the future

You can do it!
Dennis.
