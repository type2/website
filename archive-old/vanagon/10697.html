Remember that game I tried to start a while back, guessing how much I
have sunk into my bus?

Well, last night, I added in the shox and stuff I bought recently,
and the total is now a tad over $4100, and I still have about 
$500 in rubber to buy (window seals, etc) and I'm budgeting $400 for
paint!

For all intents and purposes, I have completely restored it mechanically,
and am about 3/4 - 4/5's done with the cosmetic restoration.

Also, on the T handle latch question and the ignition switch question I
had previously:

A locksmith is making me a key right now for the T handle - $18, including
the new key.

They can't re-key the ignition to the other lox bagel the keyways are
too different.  Anyone want to unload an early ignition switch?
