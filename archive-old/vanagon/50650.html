Subject: Reet-reet-reet (solved) '83 Vanagon noise

VanBondo was wondering lately regarding a noise which was emitting form the
passangeer side rear wheel. Several suggestions were given. Thanks to all on
that point.
Time was found to investigate and for once the answer turned out to be low
buck. &lt;hooray!&gt;

Answer: A streched E brake cable was rubbing on the half axle just behind
where the wheel bolts on. Temporary fix was to simply move the cable out of
the way. The *correct* fix will/should be to replace the ebrake cable and
adjust appropriately.
 Thanks again for the helpful suggestions.
