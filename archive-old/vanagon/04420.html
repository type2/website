&gt; 
&gt; Excuse me, but piece of shit????  Most of the major changes to the
&gt; VW vans...or VWs in general which made them difficult to work
&gt; on or less reilable (ie: wasserboxers) were the result of US
&gt; mandated emission controls, safety equipment, etc.

	Yeah, good stuff like mandated emission controls, safety equipment. No?


 One could
&gt; also say some of the changes were mandated by the market place...
&gt; because of increased competition from Toyota, Nissan, hell even
&gt; the US manufacturers...
&gt; 

	Sure. Other manufacturers saw the light regarding smaller cars, but
	also developed ones that were quieter and cleaner.


&gt; The beetle was taken off the US and eventually the European market
&gt; not because VW didn't want to sell it....but because the competition
&gt; was able to do, what the average driver wanted, better. The same
&gt; applies to the vans...the average driver just wants an appliance
&gt; like that piece of shit Caravan.
&gt; 
	I think the Beetle left the US because its' air-cooled thang was
	not going to meet EPA spec. and the Rabbit was its' replacement.
	Mexico City still enjoys the Beetles' contribution to its' air.

	Well, yes, it is depressing about the existence of those average
	drivers, but some us do have to live with them. Hell, some of us
	are even related to some.

	Why is the Caravan a POS? It does well what it's designed to do.
	Or is it a POS specifically because of the people it was designed for?
