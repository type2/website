We used the jump seat for our baby seat until Alex was two years old. Its an 
ideal position, considering seat manufacturers recommend you face a baby 
seat backwards for the first six months or so. We used a Century 2000 seat, 
put it in on the passenger side jump seat so all we had to do was pop open 
the door and reach in a little and in Alex went.
