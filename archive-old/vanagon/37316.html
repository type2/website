&gt;I saw an ad for a 1.7 L Porsche 914 motor and was wondering if this would
&gt;fit in my '79 Bust.  If it would fit, is it a bolt up, plug in the Bus FI
&gt;stuff and go job or something worse.  The guy says 'Runs well, $250.'  Is
&gt;this a good idea or should I invest $250 in the motor I currently have.  I
&gt;haven't taken it apart yet to see what's wrong with it.  My compression test
&gt;was less than inspiring (0 on 1 and 3, 70 &amp; 110 on 2 and 4) so I'm weighing
&gt;my options.

Real big difference in performance of 1.7 versus 2.0.  Try to find money for
the correct engine.
