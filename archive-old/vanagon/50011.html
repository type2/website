Subject: Low speed fan resistor


Greetings-

Someone previously posted information about the location/function of the low 
speed fan resistor for a 1986 Vanagon.  I own a 87 Vanagon and my Bentley 
schematics do not show this resistor.  Does anyone know if this resistor is 
only used in some years or just not shown in the Bentley?

Thanks again-

 Vic Welker
