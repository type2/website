Subject: Re: '87 Vanagon Power SteerProblem

&gt;Well, I guess I'm the only one who's ever had any problems with the power
&gt;steering ? 

So far Frank, (it's only a matter of time).

 Lot of bucks for a pump ?  There is a
&gt;kit to rebuild consisting of seals, bearings and gaskets that I was
&gt;quoated from $140. to $63. 

                ^^^^^^^  this looks promising.

The Bentley manual is quite detailed on the test/rebuild procedures for pump 
and rack. I can xerox/fax pages if you wish?   tim s.
