Yep, Thom posted a nice big thing on how he did his.  I have it archived 
somewhere if you can't find it in the list archive.

Simply, yes, there are 3 pieces of rubber.  There are screws that hold 
the frame together... soak 'em in something to loosen 'em up.  The 
carefully try to get them out with out stripping the heads.
