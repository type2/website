Subject: RE: Lighter tyres for lighter steering? 

Lionel,

I don't see how changing you tires will have an affect on your steering.

In a previous message we where discussing the use of 205/70R14 tires vs.  
185R14.  The 205 mm wide tire will increase steering loads because of the 
torque required to turn the tire.  The contact patch of a 205 mm wide tire is 
&gt;10% wider than a 185 mm tire.  Therefore, the torque required to turn the 205 
mm tire will be about 10% higher than the 185 mm.  A 205/70R14 tire is heavier 
than a comparable 185R14 tire.  Most of this weight is around the 
circumference of the tire.  While spinning, the gyroscopic effects of the 
205/70R14 tire will be greater than the 185R14 tire, thereby resisting changes 
in direction more and increasing steering loads at speed.

Lionel, you can't go to a smaller tire since you are already using 185R14's.  
At best you might be able to go to a slightly lighter tire by buying tires 
with less reinforcement, but the effects would probably be negligible.  Also, 
your handling response will be reduced.

I don't recommend a change in tires.  The heavier steering effort is probably 
due to either a design change in the steering and/or your steering has some 
worn components.

To answer your other questions, see my posting titled &quot;RE: more on 
tires/pressures&quot; dated 25 Feb 97.

&gt;My 1982 aircooled bus used to have such light steering that people thought

&gt;This tyre talk makes me wonder whether changing the tyres may lighten the
&gt;steering. Is this true? My tyres say: 185 R14 C, 102/100, 65 psi max, max
&gt;single load 1873 lbs. Label says Southern. The other front one says almost
&gt;the same thing except label is Firestone, load is 1875 lbs and it also says
&gt;P 8 PR. I wonder where I can find out what all this means.
&gt;
&gt;1. Can I change to a lighter tyre or a better brand?
&gt;2. With a max of 65 psi, can I pump up a bit higher - I've got it on about
&gt;42 at the moment? The handbook says 35 front and 47 rear, the door sticker
&gt;says 36 front and 48 rear. I would never be taking the tyres to anywhere
&gt;near their limits of load, acceleration or speed.
