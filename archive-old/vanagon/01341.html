Subject: Re: gopher archive search

&gt;
&gt;The gopher archive search is currently broken.  We're working on it.  
&gt;I'll post a note when it's fixed.
&gt;
&gt;Sorry for any inconvenience.

Ahh...   Thanks for the note Gerry.  I thought it was just
my ignorance and inexperience.  Um, on that note, are there
any other owners out there who are terrified of doing things
to thier vehicles other than change the oil and such for fear
of screwing it up?
I've been collecting the repair books and now have the Haynes,
the Bentley, and the Muir bible.  I re-read them and I'm still
too afraid to even take the spark plugs out for fear of stripping 
their seats.  I have a ritual that I follow every time I start 
the beast ('74 station wagon (what a name), Kombi):  I sit there
for a few heart beats and mentally say the mantra;  please don't
die, please keep running...  
Well, my wife and I, *did* change the clutch cable when it broke.
And I was *so* proud afterwards...  And I *did* check the pressure
relief valve and that other one which I can't remember now... 
But I want to do more for the thing.  I bought feeler gauges and
a torque wrench so that I could adjust the valves and clean out
the oil sump plate.  But while I'm working up the courage to adjust
the valves (I think I can, I think I can);  I just look at the 
torque wrench and imagine myself destroying the case by applying
9.5ft pounds instead of 9ft pounds to the sump plate.  Arghh...
I've got to get over this fear.  Any one else out there with
this irrational state hanging over them?  How did some of you
beat it?  (Repeat after me:  Please don't die.  Please keep running.)

    --Ralf
