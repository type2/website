Subject: New Westy Camper due in US?
Date: Thu, 29 May 97 12:44:03 -0400
From: Dave Mancuso &lt;Mancuso_at_etown.k12.pa_dot_us&gt;

A friend of mine is a VW Service Manager at a local dealer. He told me 
that Westfalia is coming out with a new Camper that all the dealers can 
sell.

Now, he is not a Westy fan, so he may be thinking of a weekender, but he 
thought it was a full camper.

He said it was built on a eurovan, but couldn't say whether it will be 
the longer wheelbase fo the Winnegbago version.

He did say it would have sliding doors on both sides. (?!??!) Sounds more 
like a Sharan, doesn't it?

BUT, I have an old sketched plan from Westfalia for the Eurovan Camper 
that had the kitchen stuff in the back of the van (no back hatch). (I 
should scan this plan and put it on my web page, I guess. A VW rep gave 
it to me before Westfalia gave up the Eurovan Camper to Winnie).

This &quot;camper&quot; is probably not the full camper I'm hoping to see, but I'll 
let you know more as I find out. Someone else may know more about this on 
the list. I'm afraid that this will likely be a weekender type package.
