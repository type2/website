Hi,

	I have a bunch of parts for sale, from a '67 bus.
	
	I have two very nice doors, no dings or dents and good paint.
They have elepant ear poles on the top hinge.  I also have two 
elephant ear mirrors, one good, one cracked.

	I have the two-piece split bench seat, the tops of which are a little 
singed :( so they would probably need new covers, but the hay (?) inside is
still good because they'd been professionally redone already.

	I have an almost-complete set of door locks, all with the same key,
and includes an ignition switch.  The only think missing is the engine
lid latch :(  I really don't want to split the set up... 

	I also have a good speedo &amp; gas guage,  turn signal switch, 
headlight switch, wiper switch, flasher switch, '67 wiper motor 
and arms (12V-rare), steering column with real good (tight) steering box, 

	I also have a good under-dash tray.

 	Make me an offer on anything you think you're interested in,  we'll 
talk, and then I can COD it.
