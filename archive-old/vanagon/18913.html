Subject: Good Idea...Bad idea.

In the spirit of Firdays, how's this one:
        Bulli Racing.  Picture yourself in the Miller Lite add, with the 
choice of Monte Carlo racing or a local VW show (Yea, I know it doesn't 
happen, but it _is_ Friday).  You'll know the trick, with the slam of a beer 
bottle, you could have bus racing.  Me thinks that we could have categories 
like T1 vs. T4 engines, and maybe we could have a loaded class where the 
busses were loaded to some weight like say, 1000 pounds.  I don't think this 
activity would be for the faint of heart, though.  You would be motivated to 
fix the shifter, though.

My first fun Friday post.
