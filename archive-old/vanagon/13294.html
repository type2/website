Subject: Re: Tight Suspension...Too tight!

i have a 65' westy, and while i wouldn't classify the suspension as being
&quot;hard&quot; i would classify it as being bumpy! If you go over a set of train
tracks, you really bounce up and down in the cab! i have a beat up 85'
honda accord, and it just cruises over this stuff. Same too with my 73'
westy (it doesn't notice the bumps as much either).

I attributed part of my 65' bumpiness to the fact the swing axle
suspension, and now i take it easy over the bumps. wouldn't mind a ride
improvement if it didn't mean sacrificing the stock nature of my bus (no
i.r.s. suspension puh-leeze!)

michael (who has hit the roof literally!)

&gt;I have had my '67 Microbus for 3 years now, and have finally come to the end
&gt;of the road.  No not that I could ever sell it.  Or think about that!  (The
&gt;two weeks when I was redoing the brakes was toture not to be able to drive
&gt;it!)
&gt;
&gt;Anyhow, the front suspension feels like I am riding in the back of a 1 ton
&gt;Chevy pickup.  It is terribly hard.  I hadn't really payed much attention to
&gt;it until my friend picked up a '64 bus.  His suspension feels like a car!!!
&gt;Smmmmmooooth as can be.  I immediately turned _GREEN_ with envy!
&gt;
&gt;So I went to the local VW shop and got some shocks, and went about replacing
&gt;the ones that I had.  Of course I am no car mechanic, but I managed to change
&gt;them.  Thinking the old shocks were not the right type, and the new ones
&gt;would cure it sounded plausable.
&gt;
&gt;Well to my surprise, there was harly even a noticable difference.  I think I
&gt;was acutally _imagining_ a difference to hide my disappointment.  So when I
&gt;hit a crack in the pavement, it still feels like I just hit a small horse.
&gt;
&gt;The Question:  Is there something else to adjust!?
&gt;
&gt;Question #2:  The bus has a sway bar.  I noticed my friends '66 and other
&gt;friends '64 don't.  Is this aftermarket?  Would it make the suspension _that_
&gt;much tighter.
&gt;
&gt;Question #3:  What are your busses like out there?  Am I just whiney?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!
