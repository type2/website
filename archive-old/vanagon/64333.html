&gt; BTW -- It seems the fuel pump from virtually any F.I. Bus or van, Type 2,
&gt; Type 4 would fit the bill for this, as long as it could reach and sustain
32
&gt; lbs psi, and ran on 12 volts. Any thoughts or experience? I could bring a
&gt; Bosch from a '76.


The fuel-injected busses ('76-up) and the Vanagons take the same fuel pump
(Bosch GFP301 or equivalent).
