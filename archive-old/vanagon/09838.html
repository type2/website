&gt;also check the rotor and inside of the distributor cap ... mine get really
&gt;burned every 25,000 miles. this can also mess up the running.

&gt;also a vacuum leak, caused by a bad fit on the rubber boot from throttle
&gt;housing to the air-flow meter is really hard to find ... cause it's adding
&gt;air AFTER the air-flow meter has already measured what it thinks is right.

&gt;and, last but not least, even though it's common, it's often overlooked:
&gt;changed the air filter lately??

Joel,

I've just about replaced all the items you mentioned.  When you say to check the
rubber boot, is that the circular rubber gasket where the throttle body meets
the air distribution box?  I agree with you  that since the idle does not
increase i think the problem must be after the air flow meter.  Could there be a
leak at the seam where the two halves of the air distribution box come together?
I'm really reaching here!!!  I had a VW mechanic tell me that it was common to
find vacuum leaks at the junction where the intake manifolds bolt to the heads.
Mine appear ok and tight.  Looks like I may have to spend some time looking at
all the grounds and electrical contacts, and possibly remove the entire air
intake system and check for leaks...  all for now.

Thanks
Mike
