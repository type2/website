Subject: Westy Sighting -- Bethlehem, PA area

Well, yesterday when we were driving through downtown Bethlehem we saw
a very pretty white Westy ('88?) that looked a little different even from a
distance.   The pop-top was quite a bit higher than what we see around
here, but it was a pop-top allright.  It had the 4 secure fasteners on
the side.  The interior looked well dressed, too.  Even though it had
Maryland license plates, it also had some stickers, one of which was a
country sticker: IRE !!!!

They happened to drive in front of us for a mile or so, and looked
like they were trying to find a place.  We stopped next to them at a
traffic light, and noticed that the steering wheel was right-handed...
The two young women in it were looking for a local hangout of Lehigh
students, and we tried to help them as much as we could --
unfortunately we could not lead them there, since our kids were
waiting to be picked up, and we were already late.

Well, if anyone knows these people, invite them to the list!!!
