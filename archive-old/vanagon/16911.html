Subject: Rear heater core-how to get cover off??

 Greetings all!
   Well I'm back on the road and , tired of my wife complaining out clothes
smell like antifreeze, finally looking at that rear heater core.
As I look at it there are 6 screws [removed]. The cover is loose but cannot
be lifted because it catches on the plastic heater duct directing louvres
sort of things.
  I know this has been rehashed every  month of so [sorry i wasnt listening!]
Could someone please email me how to disassemble the cover?
 Thanks in advance,
 Bill Layton
