&gt;&gt;My topic for yesterday was toys, today it's power.


Well:

My first day on the list, my first post, and it has to do with something I 
was just looking into yesterday.

I own a 1990 &quot;westie&quot; synchro.  A Very Cool Vehicle.  I like it a lot.  It 
is, however, Gutless.  So I started calling around.

Finally ended up speaking to a gentlemen namen &quot;Socrates&quot; (I swear to god!) 
at someplace in Costa Mesa (phone and name later?) who proceded to give me a 
fairly well reasoned approach to the Wasserboxer stock problem.  We 
discussed things like cam shafts, overbores, horsepower and torque; he felt 
that the stocker produced good Hp, (90 or so, in my year, less in 
earlier...) but poor torque.  

His (Expensive!) solution to this minor problem was a forged (stock is cast) 
stroker crank, and replacing the &quot;Beetle&quot; conn rods with forged rods.  Parts 
cost: about $1600 (rods and crank).  (puls, of course, the Normal Things).  
Not a lot was availible in terms of the bolt-on improvement; in fact, there 
is very little.  A Big Bore throttle body may help (I have a number of a 
company who custom manufactirers these....modifying yours... in Southern 
California.  But I havn't called them yet to see if the VW is Doable).  The 
real increases are going to have to come from inside; personally, I suspect 
the Camshaft is a significant constraint (anybody have the specs on the 
cams?)

He then proceeded to ask &quot;how many miles&quot; I had on my Synchro, and when I 
mentioned &quot;ohh....about 125,000&quot; he proceeded to bet me that my motor would 
be failing (rod bolt breaking, fractured case/crankshaft/heads/225 lb 
paperweight), and I became slightly alarmed, especially when he followed 
this point up with a mention of the difficulty in finding rebuildable 
cores....He even bet me $100 my engine was Not Long For This World.

So:  More Power is availible. (at least more drivability....if not more raw 
Hp)  How much do you want to spend?  The guy I talked with seemed very 
knowledgable, and he hit all my former professional mechanic/current 
engineer buttons for saying the right thing.  I would be glad to continue 
this discussion on list or privately..... 

My return question:  What is the Mass Experience with catastrophic failures 
in the Wasserboxer engines?  
	-What mileages did your failure occur at?  
	-What is your driving habit (Long periods at 75mph?  lotsa around town?
	-How do you maintain the engine (3,000 miles between oil changes?  or:  
Oil?  What oil?)
	-Ever overheat the engine?
	-What was the root cause of the failure? (conn rod bolts, timing gear 
failure)

I will collect the results and post them back to the list.
