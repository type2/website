Got a call from a local fellow (Walter R. Ernst, Ph.D., Professor 
Emeritus, Physics, to be exact) looking for a Westfalia Pop-Top Camper.  
He said he was willing to spend upwards of $10K for one.  It had to have 
automatic (for his wife) and be in good, functional condition.  I gave 
him a rundown on the pros/cons of the various generations.  I think he 
now has a fear of wasserboxers (oops, sorry).  Feel free to offer up 
any/all fairly priced, post-'67 models that you may run across.  Call Dr. 
Ernst at 417-881-6719 or e-mail me.  We are in Springfield, Missouri, USA.
Thanks! :-)
