&gt;Do these porsche list holders have a www site or anything like the site that the
&gt;vanagon list has?  I don't have a porsche but I would like to scan for equipment
&gt;and stuff in common with my bus without subscribing to a list.  The vanagon list 
&gt;provides sufficient distraction through the day.

He'll only let you into his FTP site if you're on the list.  You can sign
up, grope thru the FTP site, and then sign off...
