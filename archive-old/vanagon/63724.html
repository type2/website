Subject: 87 weekender problems

Volks,

Over the past few months I've compiled a small list of things that
need to get fixed on my '87 wolfy.  These include:

	- PS rack - Leaks on both ends
	- Ball Joints - Thumps on bumpy roads
	- Windshield washer motor (front) dead.
	- Dead temp gauge - Just died a month ago. Radiator fan still
         cycles on/off. Sender good and gauge dead? or?
	- A/C - With the AC running, fan will switch to full (setting 4)
         and then the A/C can't be shut off, even with the engine off and
         the key removed.  Pulled the fuse to kill it. Put back in and it
	  was working OK.
	- A/C leaks water in the rear of the van, getting cushion wet. Drain
	  plugged up somewhere?
	
I don't drive the van much as I ride my bicycle to work, but these things
seem to be adding up. I'll deal with the rack and ball joints next month,
but I'm looking for suggestions on the dead temp gauge and the gremlins in
my AC.

Thanks in advance,
Sebastian Hill
