The Great Galvo said:
&gt;Just how do you define 'fiasco'. In Ireland, Opel regularly 
&gt;swap number one seller status with Ford (bleah!) and Toyota 
&gt;(urrgh!). In England, they are a solid number two to Ford and 
&gt;making good money in the process. They were operating at a loss 

Weren't Opel labelled Vauxhall in Ireland and GB? Or did they close the
factory?

driveway in France &lt;sigh&gt; :( )
