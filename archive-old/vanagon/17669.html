&gt; Hot VWs. The article should contain pictures of their conversion kit.

&gt; I'll cover your cost. Thank you.

I suggest checking out your local public library.  If they don't carry 
the magazine, they might be able to get it for you, or tell you what 
library has it.  My mother (a library type person) said that if I told 
her the page, another library would copy it and send it, gratis.  So... 
I'd like to remind everyone that your public library can be a valuable 
resource that is likely underutilized.
