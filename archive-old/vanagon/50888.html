Subject: Propex/Carver Furnace Follow-Up

Ron Katz said:

&gt;I had written to Propex requesting infor,and their regionla acccount &gt;manager sent back a letter saying that the Compact 1600 heater is &gt;&quot;about to be susperseded by an all new propane blow air heater-the &gt;Carver P4&quot; 

I called the number Ron suggested. Though the rep was very
knowlegable, he knew nothing about a Carver P4 or anything like
it. We did talk about Propex, this outfit carries in stock a larger
Propex line, the Propex X-1, 17x10x5&quot;, available in 1600(5200BTU) and
2600(8000BTU) models. Cost is 589.26 and 721.00 respectively. 

Note the BTU figure, since Chris Gibbs and others were unsure of the
Compact 1600 output - the 1600 translates for us metrically challenged
folks to 5200 BTU. Yet another trip to the archives locates several
happy campers with 5-6000 BTU units of various types. Incidently the
Eurovan Winnie uses a 12,000 BTU Suburban unit. 

So it sounds like I'm still on track for the Propex Compact 1600.

Later,

Tom F.
