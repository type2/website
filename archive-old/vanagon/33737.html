Hi folks,

Speaking of cold weather engine troubles, I'm reminded of a bug I saw on the
shoulder of the highway a few winters ago late one evening.  I was driving
my 70 Westy when I spotted this bug (68-70) on a quiet part of the highway.
It was cold and lightly snowing, but I was happy to stop for upright
engine-kinfolk.  I pulled up behind the bug and saw there were two people
inside.  I went over to the driver's window and asked if everything was
alright.  The driver (20ish male) told me that everything was fine, and
proceeded to explain to me that old VWs run poorly in cold weather and that
when they stall, it's necessary to pull over and wait awhile before
restarting.  Aha...

He was very confident about this VW knowledge (maybe he read it in his
owner's manual??!) and I really didn't wish to engage in a roadside
discussion of maintainence/repair since he seemed to have accepted the fact
that his car was behaving normally.

I just got back in my bus and drove on, thanking my lucky stars that my
engine wasn't &quot;normal&quot;.

BTW, the first time I ever broke down with my bus (I had ignored the
thumping of an outer CV joint for awhile and the cage snapped, allowing the
axle shaft to beat the balls out of shape and scar the hub before I came to
a full stop) an aircooled vanagon westy stopped for me.  I was given a tour
of the vanagon (never saw one up close before that) and my breakdown turned
into a real treat!  Wasn't too far from home, and the kind vanagon owner and
his wife gave me a lift.  Having spare parts, I was able to get it back on
the road the same day.  Sometimes it's fun to break down!
