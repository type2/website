&lt;chorus&gt;
Oh, I don't want no more this Camping Life,
Gee, but I want to go, But they won't let me go,
Gee, but I want to go home!

They say that in Volkswagens, The heat is mighty fine,
Well, I can't say that I agree, Cause ain't no heat in mine!

&lt;chorus&gt;

They say that in the Buses, you have a lot of room,
Well, just to keep it clean inside, you need a mop and broom!

They say that in the Campers, it's all so very nice,
They've even added cabinets where you can keep your spice!

They say that at the Campground, where Bradley lurks behind,
You never look straight at the fire or you will soon go blind!

When Buses get together, and gather round the fire,
The Rangers start to worry, as flames get higher and higher!
