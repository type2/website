Subject: Re: Modifying driver seat bac...

I would *love* to modify my van seats so they go back further in my 90.

I want to know exactly what you did to accomplish this. 

I had in mind adding some more notches in the metal there near the pivot so
that the seat could have more notches to go back in to but I haven't
dismantled things sufficiently to see if such a plan will work.
