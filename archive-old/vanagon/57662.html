After a top end rebuild, my dipstick decided to do the opposite, 
migrate out of the tube.  I fixed it by making some gentle bends in 
the dipstick to slide against the tube.

As to what my cause it to stick.  The tube enters the case with the 
tube engaging the case for about 1/2 inch and an o-ring sealing it.  
If the tube has pulled out, an edge of the stick might be sticking.

Is the stick bent?

I think a previous post is most likely, a piece of another stick 
broken off in there and jammed into the hole.

&gt; What could cause my dipstick to stick?
