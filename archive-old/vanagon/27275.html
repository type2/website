Subject: re: BRAKES FIXED...DUH! *BANGING HEAD*

vw_at_gulbransen_dot_com (Vw) thus decreed:

&gt;By having the vacuum flow regulator backwards you ran the risk of
&gt;having gasoline enter and even fill the brake vacuum assist unit.
&gt;That will ruin the irreplacebale diaphragm.  That happened to us when
&gt;the vacuum flow regulator froze in the open position. It let gasoline
&gt;flow through the vacuum hose, when decellerating, we suspect. To check
&gt;yours, and avoid the $200 or so that it will cost to get a new vacuum
&gt;assist unit, crawl undr the driver's seat and take the vacuum hose
&gt;off the vacuum assist unit. Smell for gasoline fumes. Leave the hose
&gt;off on a warm afternoon in a dry dust-free area. Good luck.

how long did you run like this? do you know? i only drove with the flow
regulator on wrong for about an hour. i'll check it out this evening. drove all
weekend with no problems. dust free area? hehehe this is fall in nc...ragweed
season if my nose ain't lying. *achoo*
