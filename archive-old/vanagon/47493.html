so true.

i'm having frustrations and fenestrations over trying to obtain some 
replacement electronics parts for a rummage sale  scanner i bought.  
Radio Shack has pared down their parts inventory so extensively to 
make room for their other crap i hardly bother going to them.  

&quot;But we can order it for you.  Should be here in 4 to 6 weeks.&quot;  for 
a lousy 2.1 ohm resistor.  What they don't realize is that electronic 
gizmo types as myself want their part NOW.  Needing a replacement 
part means you have found a problem and could get the #$%# thing 
fixed NOW if you had the $0.39 resistor.

I am having great luck with parts with the independent repair shops.  
Those guys are usually so glad to see someone walk in that isn't 
saying &quot;can you fix this for under $10&quot; that they practically give 
the parts away.  Actually, that happened last nite with the 2.1 ohm 
resistor.  :)

VW Content:
the 3 pin dash voltage regulators are available thru electronics suppliers 
for about $2.50.  I don't recall the voltage spec they need but 
typically the part #'s are 7805 for a 5 volt, 7808 for 8 volt, 7812 
for a 12volt etc.

-dan  -- thank you, i feel better now.
