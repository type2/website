&gt;Did anyone catch 60 minutes last night?  During
&gt;the story on Russian Nuclear Warheads, there was a brief
&gt;shot of the interviewer talking with a general and behind
&gt;them there appeared to be the sliding door side of a two-tone
&gt;Orange/cream vanagon bus.  Did anyone else see it.  I wasn't
&gt;absolutely sure it was a VW though.

it was a russian copycat van. it's called a Babushka (made by the laid-off
workers from the MiG factories near Mokba) ...it runs on vodka. Biiiggggg
fuel tank.

only problem is that when you go on long trips, after about ten gallons of
fuel has been consumed, the van weaves ALL over the road, and starts
stumbling and stuttering and singing &quot;Volga Boatman&quot; and &quot;Meadowland&quot; and
songs like that.

&lt;it's a Joke! get it! a Joke!!&gt;
