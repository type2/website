Subject: Recharge AC every year??


I used my AC at least once a week during the winiter to keep it running 
well, but after letting my vanagon sit for the last week, I turned on the 
AC, heard a little high piteched noise for a couple of seconds, and felt 
cool but not cold air coming out.  

I was going to ask the list about this today, but it seems that it's 
already a topic of discussion.  Among those of you thtaat have AC, do you 
find that you must recharge it every year even though there are no leaks?

I paid $12.99 for a recharge in TX for my volvo back in '89.  What does 
it cost for the R-12 now?

Thanks,
david
