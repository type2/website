Interesting problem. Do you have OEM lights? Check the ground cluster
near the fuse block first.Next I would clean up the fuses. Then the way
I would proceed is to get out my volt meter and check the voltage drop
across the switch. With the switch closed (on) the voltage should
ideally be zero. What about the bright lights do they act the same way?
If not I would suspect dirty contacts in the dimmer switch.

&gt;        Is the headlamp switch dis-assembleable? Any ideas?
