Subject: '61(?) Crew cab For Sale...

To all who are curious:
        I have a friend who is trying to sell a '61 (I think) Crew Cab.
Interior has been refurbed and is clean.  Exterior has some minor rust
perforation, some minor dents.  Has a Bug rear-end installed (don't ask), a
good upright 1600 installed too.  Unfortunately, there is no accounting for
taste.  He has painted it fire-engine red, with a black stripe all the way
around where the windows are.  This truck is a good project.  Runs and
drives now, but needs more TLC.  My friend is a mechanic and doesn't have
the time for it anymore.  He is thinking of asking $3000, negotiable.  All
responses need to be sent to my e-mail.  Thanks, and sorry for the
broad-bandwith..
