Subject: RE: aftermarket seats


&gt;Bill Kennedy asks how I like my Volvo seats. They are not ideal as they do
&gt;indeed sit somewhat higher than the stock seats, which can be a problem
&gt;for anyone shorter than I (177cm, 5'9&quot;?), as their feet would dangle like
&gt;those of a five-year old without touching the floor. The thicker backrest
&gt;also forces the seat further to the front, which might force a *very* tall
&gt;person's knee caps against the dash. 

 I've got seats out of a Rover, which are a little like well-stuffed
armchairs. I have no problems with the thick back rest but the thickness of
the squabs is a problem. In fact, most of the seats I have seen have squabs
that are thicker than the standard bus seats. My SO can't reach the pedals
properly but my 6'4&quot; bod (most of it legs) fits quite nicely. A friend has a
pair of Recaros in his double cab and I am planning to get some similar
ones. They are very thin ( which gives more rome for adjustment) and hard
but much more comfortable than mine. Recaros are available here quite
cheaply second hand because a lot of European cars came with them as
standard. New ones are mega-expensive though.
