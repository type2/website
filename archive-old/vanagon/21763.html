Subject: Campmor Catalogue (v. cool)

Don't remember if it was suggested by magnesium fire Martha and too lazy to
check the FAQs, but she'd definitely dig it. 

I just received the free catalogue from CampMor. As mentioned on the list a
couple of weeks back, the catalogue is filled with tons of camping, hiking,
biking, climbing, etc. items. It was well worth the effort to get.

HALF TENTS
Included are several mini/half tents that are shown attached to the arse end
of a Dodge Mini/Baby van, GMC pickup trucks with shells, OJmobiles, etc.
These are intended as extentions of the camper shell config. looks like it
could work similar to the early rear located privy tents. 
AWNINGS
Several temporary awnings that attach via feeding a rope that is sewn in to
the hem throough a rain gutter railing.  Looks like they'd work great. 
FULL TENTS
Another item shows a stand alone tent that &quot;sleeps 4-5&quot; and has an opening
in one side with a big gusset that allows direct attachment/sealing to the
rear of yet another Dodge minivan. It looks like it would work well for any
of our creatures- possibly to the usual side position.

For CampMor's free catalogue and pricing call 1-800-226-7667
