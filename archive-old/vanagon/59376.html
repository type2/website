Hi All,

There is an 86 Syncro GL near where I live that is still for sale.  It is
ready to drive anywhere, but you'll need to keep an eye on the coolant, or
add some Alumiseal as it has developed an external head gasket leak.

Original owner, 127k, Buckskin brown with a nice interior (backseat folds
flat), newer tires, some new exhaust parts.  Drivetrain is fine, 4 speed
w/ granny low, no differential lock on this one.  There is a little seam
rust starting and the sliding door was grazed a little.  It's still shiney
and looks and runs well, but nds some attention.  It can be driven and is
a good deal for someone, esp. if they have h2o Vanagon mechanical
experience.  I am passing on it as is is not feasible for me to get it at
this time.  I am test driving it tonight and the owner needs to sell it
badly.  $2500 firm, a great deal!  email me for more info.  I'll need to
know asap if there is something you'd like me to look at when I inspect it
tonight (Monday, May 5th).
