Darie etc.,

I am not qualified to comment on most of your questions.  However, I do 
know that any time you open the brake system you must bleed the system. 
 You have described exactly what brakes feel and act like with air in them. 

You probably only need to bleed the circuit to the wheel that you worked on 
though.

Mike
