Subject:  P.I. 2082 - Accelerator cable change

A modified accelerator cable has been introduced in production, as of
VIN: 25 JH 062 158.  The modified cable is available through the Parts
Deivision.  Although the part number remains the same, the improved
cable can be identified by a white plastic sheath enclosing the length
of the braided cable.  This sheath protects the braided cable from
outside elements.

When repairs are necessary to the accelerator, ensure the following:
*  The boots that cover the ends of the cable housing are installed
   and not damaged.  Replace if necessary.
*  Check the hose that joins the housings.  If not intact, replace it
   and install hose clamps on both ends.
*  Install improved accelerator cable.

then i looked a couple of the microfiche and got these:
part numbers for reference:                           check with the
Accelerator cable:  manual trans - 251-721-555 Q      Parts Dept. to
                    auto trans   - 251-721-555 E      make sure these
Rubber boot (rear/engine):         251-723-580        are correct.
Rubber boot (front/pedal):         251-723-580

note: that VIN is a 1988 model vanagon, so all pre-1988's have the old style
cable. 1989 and later have the new one. 1988's will have to check their VIN.

point being that it might be worthwhile to replace that noisy cable with the
new one.
