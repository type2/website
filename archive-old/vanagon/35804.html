Subject: VANAGON digest 831VWoA

On Dan Herbert's note, and the Response from VWoA:

How about someone drafting a nice letter to VW of A and VW Germany
which basically suggests they fire all their lip-service people, pay
for a few more *mechanical service* people, and use the leftover money
to satisfy more of their loyal customer base???

I think a nice letter from a list this size would go a long way to
convince VWoA / VW Germany...

It is quite disturbing to see the same kind of problem already
plaguing Corp. America to be prevalent in VWoA as well -- we have one
person do the rowing, 8 people do the steering and communicating, and
when we lose the boat race, we fire the the rower, give the remaining
8 awards for saving money due to cutting costs, i.e. firing the
rover... 

Sorry, this must be venting day....l
