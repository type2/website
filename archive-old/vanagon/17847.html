&gt;&gt;&gt; On the rear brakes of my '85 vanagon there is a spring loaded clip on 
&gt;&gt;&gt; each side shoe.  Once you remove these three or four times (don't ask) 
&gt;&gt;&gt; they aren't so hard to get back replace.  Basically, I took a pair of 
&gt;&gt;&gt; pliers half opened and pinched the little metal &quot;shield&quot; and spring in 
&gt;&gt;&gt; one hand.  Then reached around and held the little pin in place with the 
&gt;&gt;&gt; other hand and ....PUUUUUUUUSHED...  
&gt;
&gt;I use my trusty 6&quot; vise-grips adjusted to just the right size to hold the
&gt;round spring keeper, not bend it, then push the pin through and turn the
&gt;vise grips.

I am not exactly sure what your talking about becouse I only work on 
pre-79 buses, but if they are similar I have had great success using 
my 6&quot; needle-nose vise-grips just as eugene has.
