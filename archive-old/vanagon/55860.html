Subject: Corona de Tucson ~ more directions...

Arizona Bus Club will be holding the &quot;Winter Jerome Jamboree&quot; aka Corona de
Tucson IV on Feb 22-23, 1997 SE of Tucson.

VanBondo has been getting a lot of correspondence from California, Texas and
New Mexico as well as the given Arizona &quot;Monkeywrench Militia.&quot;

Corona de Tucson is a smallish community located about 15 miles SE of Tucson
on I-10. I think that there is a signed exit.  Directional Ques according to 
http://www.mapquest_dot_com/cgi-bin/ia_find?screen=wm_view&amp;link=ia_find&amp;uid=e01a
brd0806very

indicate to exit I-10 at hwy 83, and continue (South) to Saguaroita road and
make a right (West). Flounder from there looking for the VFW. Look for the
&quot;bitchenest&quot; '67 camper that you ever did see! Bring Beer, Bratwursts, and
your Bug/Bus and Babies!
