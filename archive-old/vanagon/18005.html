Subject: Re: New life for worn out air flow meter

Here's the latest in my attempts to repair my rich running van. I had
suspected the ignition system but replacing the cap and rotor and plugs
failed to give relief and pursued other possibilities (one is listed
below). So, being a little more thorough this weekend I ohmed out the 
spark plug wires and found a huge resistance in the coil wire (like off
the scale instead of the 2k per Bently). Today I will buy new plug 
wires but in the meantime I was curious about the resistance of the 
primary side of the coil. Bently says it should be ~.5-.75 ohms but 
I measured 1.5 ohms with an accurate digital meter.  Should I also 
replace the coil? If the plugs and coil don't help I've got to decide 
to either replace the air flow meter or take it to the shop.

Thanks for any help and sympathy,

Steve

&gt;I'm the one that complained about poor idle on my '85 van. It's always
&gt;fun to go down various paths to attempt a fix:) I thought my idle
&gt;stabilizer had gone out and was in the process of trying to prove it
&gt;when I discovered the van was runing very rich. Hmmm... this was always
&gt;a symptom of a dirty resistor substrate in the air flow meter. But I
&gt;had already cleaned it to no avail. Well I took a closer look and found
&gt;that a couple spots were worn through. Yikes! These things must cost 
&gt;a zillion bucks so I wondered about alternatives. That's when I noticed
&gt;that the substrate is attached by three screws. Two on one side and one
&gt;on the other. Well I took the one screw out of the one side and was 
&gt;then able to pivot the substrate so that the wiper came in contact with 
&gt;non worn substrate.
