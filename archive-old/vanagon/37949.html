Subject: Thanks and Bye (for now) 


	Well I am going to unsubscribe for a while and then I should be 
back soon.  I am subscribing to a non-VW list (punk-list) and the 
combination of the two is giving me about 200-250 msgs a day, so untill I 
figure if this other list is worth the hassel I am going to limit myself 
to one.
	I want to thank the members who responded to my problems with my 
wing window, and possesed fuel gauge.  Reading this list had given me a 
lot more confidence in my bus and my ability to do things to it. Thank 
you all, and good bye (for now).
