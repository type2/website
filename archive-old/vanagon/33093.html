&gt; Probably a modern-day Mexican Kombi...

Saw one of these vans, a Mexican Caravelle, just last weekend here in
Santa Cruz and talked to the guy driving it.  I've seen millions in Baja
and Pacific Mexico but had never seen one in the states.  It was a '91,
with the big black radiator in the front.  He didn't know anything about
the engine specs to tell me, except to say it was gas-powered, and I
didn't have time to check.  The body is straight out of 1978, kind of
cool looking with that black thing up front.

You can buy them today in Mexico brand new for less than US$10,000 with
the peso the way it is - the trick is just getting them in (I've checked
it out, and it's heinous to do legit.)  The driver of this one was a US
citizen with a permanent residency permit in Mexico, and the van had
plates from Guerrero.  He says they just wave him through at the border,
and he's had it here for up to six months at a time (has homes both here
and there.)

I don't know how much his permanent resident status figures into it, but
it seems like the trick is basically just to keep the registration up to
date in Mexico and you can drive it indefinitely here.  If you had a
buddy in Mexico to act as your front for the purchase and registration
(wonder what the insurance requirements are there?) you might be able to
pull it off...

Actually, more interesting (and relevant) to me now that I've got my
Syncro wasserboxer, is whether any of those Mexican-mfg'd engine parts
would be drop-in replacements for a 2.1L with Digifant.  Anyone want to
hazard a guess on this?  Could be extra motivation for a Baja-moto this
winter!
