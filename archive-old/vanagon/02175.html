&gt;But which type is better in terms of distance (sensitivity) and chanel
&gt;separation? Mine are actually walky-talky CBs. They were used only a few
&gt;times since I bought them new 10 years ago. Since I have only 2 channels
&gt;installed and they are not adjacent channels the crosstalk between the
&gt;two channels is nonexistent.

my experience has been that the crystal radios are not as good as the 40
channel jobs. i've had both, and the distance is basically a function of
power (how many watts), but the sensitivity (IMHO) is better on the
newer synthesized 40 channel models. plus the cost of those crystals got
too expensive for me (plus i couldn't change channels quickly).

for those of you contemplating buying a cb, you might want to check on one
of those emergency kits ... it comes with a cig lighter plug, magnetic
antenna, and the radio. it's not handy for rolling down the road, but it's
designed to be used for emergencies.
