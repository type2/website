Subject: 80 Westy Odometer Problems

I have a 1980 Westfalia Vanagon that has a broken odometer (speedometer
works fine) and I have been reading recent e-mails about how to fix the
odometer.  I took my speedometer out of the dash and found that sure enough,
my odometer gear had a small crack in it and that it had slid off the shaft
enough to not engage with the other gears.  After attempting to glue the
gear and keep it from sliding off the shaft, I decided that it was time to
get a new gear as the old one was obviously to worn to keep using it.   

Does anybody know of a place where I can purchase this gear?  I really would
like to get one.  Also, until I can get a new gear, if anyone knows how to
keep the old gear on the shaft, glue, pin etc, let me know.  My gear and
shaft keep moving back and forth.
