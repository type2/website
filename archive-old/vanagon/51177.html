Subject: Re: Joel's Friday Stats...

:So Joel...
:
:When you post the stats about what state has how many list
:members and what types of VW thay have...
:
:How do you get that info?  I have never seen anyone sending it
:to you?  When people subscribe to the list, does their
:geographic location somehow get stored as well?
:
:Don't tell me you just make it up??

Is this a trick question?

I think it would be great if you just made it all up Joel. Sort of
like the way the government operates.
