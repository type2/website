Hi all,

I finally got around to reading some of my Vanagon digests...I've been
lurking way too long.

Hi Stephen,

You can get a replacement switch from Radio Shack. The switch that you
want is a 'micro-mini, PC-mount, SPST switch. Costs less than a couple
of bucks. Don't bother asking the employees for help unless you're
looking to buy a portable CD player. I like to ask them technical
questions just for fun, &quot;Scuse me, could you tell me if this will work
with a 4017 decade counter/divider chip?&quot; hehehe

'PC-mount' just means that it has pins on bottom as opposed to tabs so
it can be soldered to a printed circuit board and 'SPST' means single
pole, single throw or 'on/off'. A single pole, double throw should
probably work as well. 

It's easy to install, you just remove the two screws on the panel and
unplug the little circuit board from it's harness under the sink. The
whole unit comes right out for easy desoldering of the old switch and
soldering in of the new one. It helps if you have experience with
soldering when you are working with those tiny pins, but it's basically
a simple task.  

I replaced mine with a SPDT with a center off position so that it could
display the status of my secondary battery as well. 

HTH,
Noel
