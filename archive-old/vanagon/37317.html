Thanks to all those who responded to my posting &quot;Aurgh! Vanagon climate 
controls make me mental&quot;.  I now have tons of heat pouring out of the rear 
heater.  Of course, I do have one more (unrelated) question:

Sometimes when I make a turn in my '89 Westie, I hear a &quot;ping&quot; sound that 
seems to be coming from the rear.  It sort of sounds like a piece of metal 
is flexing.  I thought it might be part of the camper gear (maybe the top of 
the stove) but it really sounds like it's coming from way back in the van.

Any ideas?
