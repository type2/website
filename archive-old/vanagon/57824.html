&gt;I performed a tune on on my van last week and would like to know if I
&gt;missed any parts. We are planning tons of camping trips this summer
&gt;including spending the whole month of August in Alaska!
&gt;
&gt;Parts Changed
&gt;
&gt;* cap &amp; rotor                           * oxygen sensor
&gt;* spark plugs &quot;bosh&quot;                    * changed oil in manual trans
&gt;* wire's                                * K&amp;N air filter
&gt;* fuel filter                           * Rad flush
&gt;* water pump belt
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Did I miss anything?

Flush, change the brake fluid.
