Subject:       Axel swapping

Not to be confused with other forms of swapping... :)

Just a quick note on 'swapping sides' for the benefit of CV joints. 
Remember, if you swap sides, ie take the left axle and put it on the
right, you've gained nothing.  One needs to swap ENDS of the
axle,with it remaining on the same side.  It does work BTW, if the CV 
joints are just border-line.  If they are trashed, buy new ones.

This is a picky-picky distinction but it may save someone some 
confusion and fruitless work.
