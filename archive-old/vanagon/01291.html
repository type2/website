Subject: Body parts for 78 Westphalia

I have just acquired a 78 Westphalia that requires the usual replacement
of the rocker panels, and wheel wells etc. I am looking for a good
west coast source if possible of mailorder parts. Any suggestions as to who
is a good source, and has a good catalogue available. Any info would be most
appreciated. Thanks in advance.
