Subject: Overheated with strange oil light flicker, 85

Recreation called today and drew me into the deep country to go hiking, the
last stretch of road was a muddy uphill &quot;road.&quot;  Not much traction, quite a
bit of spinning, but constant motion, i was never stuck.  Before hitting
this road the vanagon's temp gauge was on the white line at the bottom, nice
and cool.  After driving up this muddy uphill road for awhile the temp got
up to the mid mark, which is the highest I have seen since the summer.
After awhile the oil light started to flicker.  I do have 20w50 in there
(and enough of it too, checked it before i left), so that pretty much rules
out that cause (it wasn't idleing either).  I immediatly shut it off and
went to the engine compartment, it smelled burnt, checked the oil, looked
underneath for drips or flowing oil, looked in the coolant tank for any oil,
as best as i could, anything which could be the cause the loss in oil pressure.

I did my hiking all the while worrying and came back and crossed my fingers
and it started right up and no problems at all.  I don't think i really
overheated it, but the flickering oil light was the big question mark.

A friend of mine who drove the same stretch of road had the same exact
problem, mid range coolant temp and an oil light, however his vehicle was a
70's dodge volare.  I did also see a caravan/voyager on the side of the road
with the hood up, probably over-heated also.

ideas?
