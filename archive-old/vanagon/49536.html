Subject: F.S. '85 Westy GL  4spd A/C $3500 o.b.o.

Theres a really nice metallic brown '85 Westy GL with a tan velour interior for
sale near me. The owner , a older gentleman, has owned it since it had 6k on it.
It now has 160k on it but has been excellently maintained and the body and
interior are spotless. It is a 4spd and has a new clutch. The A/C works fine.
The poptop was only ever opened once. ( the man says his wife would rather sleep
in a motel)  The power steering rack was replaced and so was the waterpump. the
front and rear bumpers are completely straight and the paint is nice and shiny
with no body damage or rust.  $3500 seems like a reasonable price since the van
is in excellent shape. The camper is located near Allentown Pa.   If interested
e-mail me and I'll give you his home phone#.
