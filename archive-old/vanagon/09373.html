&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello,
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; ------------ reference to stall experience deleted ----------------
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; So, is the cure low risk and worth the effort?
&gt;&gt;&gt; 

I had the exactly intermittent misfiring experience on my 84 vanagon. In one 
occasion it was so bad that the engine finally came to a stop and could not be
restarted. I had the vanagon towed home. Once it got home it restarted fine.
It continued to work fine for sometime including a trip to Yosemite National
Park. But then the problem appeared again once a week or so.

I began to swap all ignition and FI components from a 83 westy. It ended up
more confusion to me as to what caused the problem.

Finally I stopped going to ARCO gas station in my neighborhood. Instead I
returned to Shell at a cost of 10 more cents per gallon.

The misfiring symptom has been gone for at least 4 months since then. My 
believeing is that ARCO gas has something in it which upsets vanagon's FI
system. If I remember correctly I began to have the problem only when I began
to buy ARCO gas. Once I return to Shell the problem is gone.
