Subject: understeer solution?

Whilst driving on the highway 101 in California last week I noticed
quite a bit of understeer at speed.  I'm running a stock suspension
and KYB gas shocks.  It's a bit loose in the corners.

I was thinking of going over the front end to find weak points and
fix them.  (I've seen the rubber boots on the tie rod ends are split.)
After that I may add a front &amp; rear sway bar kit. 

Does the vanagon collective have any advice in this area?

TIA,
