Subject: Re: Bad fuel pump?
Date: Thu, 17 Nov 94 10:48:43 PST

&gt; 
&gt; My bus was acting like it was out of gas when the tank was about half 
&gt; full. I read in the Muir book that the first half of the tank flows out 
&gt; with gravity and the second half reqiures the pump. So I put in a brand 
&gt; spankin' new pump, everything's fine for about 2 tankfuls, and now it's 
&gt; doing it again! Assuming the pump is fine, what could be going wrong?
&gt; 
&gt; Any help appreciated,

  There is a screen _in_ the tank at the fuel outlet fitting. I took mine out
  about a year ago and it was COVERED with rusty crud. To clean it, first 
  drain the tank by some means, then remove the nut that holds on the outlet
  tube. The outlet tube comes right off - pull on the things that looks like
  a washer/gasket- the screen is attached to it and should come out. 

  With the rumors that the oxygenators being put in some fuels now are more 
  corrosive, this may become a regular maintenance item on older buses.
