Derek,
Its not all that critical as long as itfits where you want want it Radio
Shack is an excelent sorce for the colored diodes Just to be sure try to
measure the votage at the conecting wires to give you some Idea (it will
be very low) also  make sure that the diode is put in with corect
end/wire to ground as they are Directional and wont work the wrong way
