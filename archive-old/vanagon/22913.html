&gt; In the meantime, if anyone has any suggestion on how to remove residual 
&gt; silicone from the fiberglass top, I'd love to hear...

go to a FLAPS and get a can/jug of PrepSol (TM) degreaser used to 
remove waxes/grime before autobody painting.  also, you may want to 
warm the decals with a hair dryer, after application, and rub them in 
to the pebbles of the fiberglas real well.
