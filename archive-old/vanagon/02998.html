&gt; I, too, have noticed that it is VERY difficult to read
&gt; the oil-stick exactly!  All hints appreciated....


Martha Martha...

  I know at least 5 people on the list who have *no* problem
reading their oil-stick. You see, the oil-burners have a very
nice cap with a straight stick easily accessible from behind the
license plate..

  ..Of course, adding oil to the sump requires a funnel, since there
ain't enough room for a plastic oil-can  (I bet the old metal spout on the
oil-can would work just fine)
