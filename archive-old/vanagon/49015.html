Subject: leaking gas tank on fillup

Has anyone else had this wonderful experience? Upon filling up the gas tank
of our 89 Westy, hear and smell gas trickling, look underneath and gas is
spilling from all around the gas tank, as if the seams have burst. In
reality only about a quart? of gas is spilled and flow stops by itself. Get
home and try to find source, but no luck. Logic would point to a loose
connection in the overflow system but nothing obvious can be found. Any
insights into this condition? Of course we are scheduled to leave on a ten
day trip in two days.
