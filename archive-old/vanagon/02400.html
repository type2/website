&gt; 
&gt; I would like to extend an invite to any and all of you that make it
&gt; all the way to No. Calif to stop by for Suds+Steak catered by as many
&gt; of the locals as I can get together. I figure we can put it on at one
&gt; of our great parks..should be a hoot.
&gt; 

I vote for any recommended stops that include Suds (beer/ale that is).  :)

Although I do plan to do some laundry on the way.  I guess that's the
down side of the trip. :(
