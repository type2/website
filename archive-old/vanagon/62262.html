&gt;Helmut:

&gt;What's the electric water pump for?

It keeps the coolant circulating AFTER the engine stops.
Prevents overheating during a warm start.

&gt;I know that the vanagons in Europe could be had with a 1.6 TD.
&gt;Did they ever sell them with the 1.9 or 1.9TD? Why not?

Sorry, I was wrong. Thought about the 1.6 TD.

&gt;I've never seen a 1.9 or a 1.9 TD here (in Rochester, NY), but I
&gt;know they were sold in Canadian Jettas. But if you get it out of
&gt;the Jetta, won't you have the same interference problem with the
&gt;turbo and the vanagon motor mount as with the 1.6 Jetta TD?
&gt;(This is, I understand, why listmembers have used Quantum manifolds)

I heard about the interference, but couldn't figure out why. Both
manuals, Golf and Vanagon, are showing the same picture about the
charger setup. Do anyone have a drawing about this?

&gt;Bob:

&gt;Where did you get the 1.9?
