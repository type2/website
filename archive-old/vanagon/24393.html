Subject: Clutch cables

&gt;Even so, you can still have problems.  I got a new clutch cable for my 
&gt;bus, and it had larger threaded end for the wing nut.  The original one 
&gt;was a little smaller, and just had a double nut (old system).  So I took 
&gt;it back to the VW store and told them of the problem, so they said I 
&gt;needed a new boden tube.  So I got one, and it still didn't go through.  
&gt;So again I returned and told them of my problems, it seems that where the 
&gt;end of the clutch cable is crimped on the end of the cable was to wide.  
&gt;And all of the cables had the problem.  So I had to file a little off to 
&gt;make it fit.  That's aftermarket parts for ya.

When I had the '63 bus and had to replace the clutch cable, I drilled out
the ends of the bowden tube to accept the cable that works with the much
easier to use wing nut.
