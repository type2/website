Subject: RE: Duplicate postings - me or you?


&gt;I see dulpicate postings several times a day - mostly together, but
&gt;sometimes separated by several other postings.  Is this something any of 
you
&gt;are experiencing or is just me?


I see those too, from the vanagon list. But my own posts to the list,
have never been duplicated.
