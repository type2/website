Subject: Sliding side door stuck...



Perhaps someone on this list can help me out with this.  Whenever,
the weather turns colder after a warm spell or the cold is combined
with high humidity, the sliding door on the van seals itself shut.
No amount of coaxing with free it.  The rear portion of the latch
releases but that is it.  I think that the rubber seals may be
adhereing (sp?) together and was thinking of maybe putting on a thin
film of vaseline.  Any ideas or solutions would be appreciated.
