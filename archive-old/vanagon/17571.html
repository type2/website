Hi Harry,

Thanks for your response. I'm not necessarily worried about running the battery
down. I'm concerned about using an alarm that is triggered by voltage fluctuations.
Normally a voltage drop occurs when a door opens and the dome light comes on
and this will trigger the alarm. Based on your info, I'm wondering if the refrigerator
cooling fan will trigger the alarm when it comes on. This would be a problem.

Does the Clifford alarm detect when the doors open by sensing voltage fluctuations?

Thanks,

Jeff
