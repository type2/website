Subject: Tents and Fridges

Hi all,

Starting with tents - someone spoke of a canopy type that goes over the end
of the vehicle. I've seen those here, but it seems to me that they're gonna
fill up with exhaust fumes when you drive away. Do they have something to
prevent that?

Moving on to fridges, mention that Westfalia (?) are going over to
compressor fridges. Are these 12V? Anyone measured the current? My
absorbtion 2-way Electrolux takes 10-12A on 12v (100W nominal), so I just
don't bother with it on DC. 

Regards,
