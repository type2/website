Hello Derek!! It=B4s Peter here!!

My present VW is a =B494 model. Therefore it is the T4 model as=20
it is called in Europe. We had an =B488 crewcab before (our company, but=20
it=B4s &quot;my&quot; car) but the 1.6 litre diesel was a little to weak for driving=
=20
underground. It was 2nd gear and top revs, so the cylinder head=20
overhauled. I have no doubts about your pics in the snow, with the old=20
syncro i droved in snow up to the doorhandles and it flowed at the sides=20
uptil the windscreen. The T4 has a 5cyl diesel and it is a little=20
stronger, it can go up from the mine in 3rd gear and 3000revs. It gives=20
a more relaxed driving. It is dark metallic blue with aluminium bed with=20
foldable sides. I have mounted wooden steering wheel and dashboard. In=20
the front factory mounted fog lights, and black coulored turnsignals.=20
I=B4m not sure about the gear ratios, but i suppose you thought i had a=20
transporter like yours. I can thou tell that i miss the terrain gear and=20
lower geared reverse. With the T4 when you start in steep upphill, you=20
have to have high revs and be careful on the clutch. Please write if you=20
want to know more about the new syncro, or about working in an=20
underground. We have three shotcrete rigs, eight concrete trucks, three=20
concrete pumps and rockbolting rigs and so on.
Regards Peter
