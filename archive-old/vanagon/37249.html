&gt; 15&quot; wheels.  I would like to keep the bus as stock as possible but would it be 
&gt; better to go with 14s instead?
&gt; What are the advantages if any?  Any reply would be greatly

I thinkg 15's are better because you can run taller tires=lower engine
RPM.  You're also better situted for checking out women at stoplights:)
