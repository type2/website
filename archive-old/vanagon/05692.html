Subject: EuroVan Fog Light Switches


For any EVers out there who are thinking of putting fog lights
on your EV...guess what...VWUS does not sell fog lamp kits or
fog light switches (to match the dash) for that matter.

I think part of the problem with the fogs is that they are expensive
little suckers....at least the ones that are supposed to go into
the bumper. The VW dealer in Wolfsburg wanted $270 for the pair!
Hopefully over the next couple of weeks I can find a set that will
fit into the bumper area.

I went down to the dealer, and yep...no fog lights, but also
no fog light switches! But not to fear. The switches (rear
defrost, air recirculating, etc. are straight out of the
91 thru 94 Passat! So are the fog light switches for the
EV. There was a 93 Passat on the lot with fogs, and 
the switch matched the EV switches (size, face plate, etc).

Well, they almost matched. The Passat switches are placed in
the dash horizontally, while the EV switches are vertical. Other
than the &quot;pictogram&quot; on the face of the switch being 90 degrees
off, Passat fog light switches will fit an EV!!

call me the Joel Walker of the EV world)!    Ric
