&gt;questions: i'll be receiving a rebuilt motor (30,000 miles ago) for
&gt;my 81 in a few weeks, and be faced with my first engine
&gt;removal/installation.  the motor currently in the vehicle is the california
&gt;model, and i'll be replacing it with the non-ca model.  1) what are the
&gt;differences (i'm familiar with some), which might cause complications,
&gt;and  2) any suggestions as to what should i check out/do to the 'new'
&gt;motor before installation, while it is easy to get at, in addition to
&gt;replacing
&gt;front seal, checking crakshaft endplay (which i still haven't quite got a
&gt;grasp on)?  i would like to do the job correctly, and spare myself future
&gt;hassle by being thorough.  i am not afraid to learn, so any wisdom
&gt;sharing would be appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;thanks from matthew and mobius the 81 adventurewagen 

The exhaust is the major difference.  The CA model has the cat in a different
place and uses an O2 sensor.  If you delete the CA exhuast, you will need to
replace the computer.  Some of the tin is different around the exhaust.
 Scavenge and reuse the EGR parts if possible.  These engines need the EGR to
keep them from melting down.
