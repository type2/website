Subject: T-shirt

To honor 30 years in business, Eastern Mountain Sports has produced a
commemorative T-shirt featuring an artist's rendition of a 1967 VW bus. The
cartoon print has a yellow kayak, green canoe, blue tent and camping
equipment all strapped to the roof of the classic red-and-white bus, a
mountain bike on a front rack, skis hanging out a window and a couple of
&quot;interesting&quot; looking guys in the front seats. There's a long-eared dog
sticking his head out of a side window and this slogan scribbled on the
side of the bus: &quot;Make Smores Not War.&quot; We bought shirts for our two small
children today; they love 'em.
