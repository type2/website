For sure it's the slave cylinder. That oil stuff you see leaking is
brake/hydraulic fluid, which should be forcing the slave cylinder to disengage
your clutch. Time for a quick look I'd say, to decide if it's a loose
connection or a shot cylinder. Sorry to hear that, trade you for my 78; it
doesn't have a hydraulic clutch system! :)
