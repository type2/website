This stuff is called Permatex 3H Aircraft sealer, or something like that. It 
comes in a little white plastic bottle with a brush on the lid. Good Stuff! I 
have heard the same argument about what to use on the case half mating seams, so
I used the 3H. (And with no oil leaks, I might add)

&gt; &gt;You mean the Permetex stuff?  It's what I use, comes in the 
&gt; &gt;'enough-to-build-a-million-engines' bottle.  About 4 ozs I'd guess.
&gt; 
&gt; This is what I've also used, comes in the can with a brush attached attached 
&gt; to
&gt; the cap.  This stuff spreads so thin as to be non-existent, but provides a 
&gt; nice,
&gt; yet breakable, seal.  Never hardens, quantity oulasts the can or your ability 
&gt; to
&gt; open it (it IS a sealant, and it tends to seal the cap on).  Absolutely
&gt; impervious to solvents, so it makes a mess that won't clean up wherever you 
&gt; put
&gt; it.  But at least you can get the Permatex off your hands with the Sta-Lube
&gt; waterless soap.
&gt; 
&gt; Just MHO.
