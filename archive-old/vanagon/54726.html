Subject:  dieselalternator, same?

Another problem for me! Yea! :(  simple question: is the alternator in 
my diesel the same as the gas models? If not, is it the same as a diesel 
jetta?  The local electric rebuilder wants $90 for rebuilding it, but I 
probably could get a used one under $50 (I hope).
TIA
