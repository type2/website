Subject: Front end collision (was seat belts)

There is a junk yard that near me that has a 73 that was involved in a 
head on, don't know the speeds but it held up well.  There was still 
enoungh room for legs down by the petals.  i was also in a bus that was 
hit head on by a person doing 40-50 mph, we were doing about 5-10 mph and 
the frame was only crimpled slighly, of course the sheet metal was 
damaged badly.  they seem to do well farely well, at these speeds anyway.
