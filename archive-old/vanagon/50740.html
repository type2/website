Josh says....
I have an '81 Vanagon L for sale in Denver. The motor, trans, outside
sliding door handle, and turn signal assemblies are already
gone, but everything else is still there. It has no rust, but some
slight damage near the left turn signal. I am asking $350, it has a
clear CO title. I would also consider parting it out.
Please E-mail if interested.
Thanks,
Josh

Are the auxiliary/passenger heaters the same on '81 and '84 models?  I need 
to spend time taking care of mine ('84) because it's getting chilly in 
MPLS....  If they're the same, how much do you want for yours Josh?
