Subject: RE: Negavtive current from my generator !!!?????

Hello,

My vanagon has an alternator, but I still remember the days of replacing 
generators.

It seems that replacement generators used to come with instructions of how 
to &quot;polarize&quot; the generator before installing.  This meant to ground the 
generator and momentarily touch the field lead to the hot battery 
connection.  Some residual magnetism would then be retained by the field in 
the correct direction.

The theory:  It seems that the field current of a generator is supplied by 
the generator itself (self exciting).  What this means is that some 
residual magnetism in the field causes a small voltage to be generated when 
the generator is spun.  This, in turn, is fed back to the field by the 
regulator, and a stronger field is produced.  This quickly bootstraps up to 
the correct field current and strength.

It seems that if the residual field is the wrong direction initially, the 
generator will just bootstrap up with the wrong polarity.  Thus the 
instructions to &quot;polarize&quot; a new generator when it is first installed.

I hope that my memory serves me right and I am not misleading you.  Give it 
a try.

Mike
