Subject: ? more leaky heads...

I'm still ruminating and meditating on what to do with my 85 vanagon with the
major head leak.  It was on the driver's side and had gotten to the point where
the van wouldn't crank because water was getting to the plug (cylinder closest
to driver).  I pulled the head off that side (here's where the meditating and
ruminating began).  With 150K, I began to wonder if JUST redoing the heads
would be worth it.  I began to think that a rebuilt long block may be in order. 
(Interestingly, I wrote to about five rebuilders, asking questions,
etc., and only heard back from one, who doesn't do waterboxers).  That, in
combination with the horror stories on this list concerning rebuilts, started
me ruminating again.  Now, I'm back to JUST redoing the heads myself.  I'll
send the heads and cylinders off to have them checked and fixed if needed, and
I'll do the rest (I have Bentley).

Now for the questions:

As a beginning mechanic, am I crazy to do this?

Is it REALLY necessary to do BOTH sides?

Does one HAVE to remove the pistons to do this?  Bentley says so..., but it
sounds kinda tricky.

Any other comments, suggestions, etc.?  Tell me something inspirational!!!

P.S.  Is there anyone out there who has done this job that would be willing to
serve as an e-mail consultant if I have questions?


Happy holidays, David
