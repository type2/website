On the junkyard thread, I was travelling through southern Ohio in early June
when we came upon several acres of bugs and vans.  It was off I-66 in Cambridge
Ohio, called the Beetle Barn.  The man had several buses ready to do restoratio
n on (I assume waiting for an order) seemed in very good shape.  Also many olde
r not so good shape.  If you are in the area it may be worthwhile.

                     Beetle Barn Automotive
                     61581 Vocational Road
                     Cambridge, OH
                     (614) 685-6566

As I am very new to this I have no way of judging prices.  But I paid $40. for
a bumper for a '79 camper.
