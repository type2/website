&gt; &gt; Hi Tim.  I have the Yokohama Y370 tires on my Syncro.  They are a 6 
&gt; 
&gt; Are these similar to the Yoko Y356 or Y376 (I can't remember) that
&gt; Tire Rack Sells? if not where did you get them?
&gt; 
Hi John.  I don't know the Y356/376 line.  As far as I know the Y370 
is a different tire.  The Y370 is an LT (light truck) tire with 6 ply 
rating, 1765 lb _at_ 65 psi max load, and a load rating of  'D'.

I got them locally (BC) at a Big-O Tire store.  Quite a few tire 
shops carry the Yokohama around here.  Even Costco carry some Yoko 
lines.

Hope this helps.

Harry.
