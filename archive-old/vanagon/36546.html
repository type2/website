&gt;a used trans?
&gt;
&gt;  Any advise would help me out alot.  I hate not having something to drive.

Sounds like the 3/4 synchro hub is damaged and the keys are floating around.
 They will get into something else and destroy the works eventually.  Some
one experienced in these tranies can repair easily before it blows.  Fix it
soon or save ypur money.  Used trans worth considering, but I'm finding them
to be tired and will need work soon anyway.
