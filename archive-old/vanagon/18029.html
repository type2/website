Subject: Re: '92 Westphalia - Safety Net

&gt;Can anyone help me locate a safety net for my '92 Westy, for use accross the 
&gt;opening to the upper bed, and used to prevent children from falling through 
&gt;the opening?  The VW Camper Supplementary Manual makes reference to this 
&gt;accessory however the dealers in B.C. here are unable to locate.
&gt;
&gt;My 2 year old son tends to move through the night and I'd hate to see him 
&gt;drop through the hole.  
&gt;

Quick introduction to the 'I'm flying' dream.   Try one of the bed rails by 
Gerber or FisherPrice. I think one of them folds flat when not in use, for 
easy storage. You might have to work out some kind of anchor, bolt+wing nuts 
etc, since the foam matteress won't hold it down too solidly. Should fit 
across OK. 
Our 5 year old sleeps happily in a canvas front hammock, sags down enough to 
keep him centred.   tim s.
