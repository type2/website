HI,

I'm afraid I'd disagree.  Though technically not a traditional head
gasket, what most folks are referring to are the large odd-shaped rubber
gaskets which ARE visible externally.  Also, they MUST be replaced anytime
the heads come off; so, if you replace the thin aluminum seals and the
small o-ring gaskets on the cylinders, you should replace the &quot;head
gaskets&quot; as well.
