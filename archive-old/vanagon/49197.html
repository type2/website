Subject: Re: Vanagon parts in Germany - long

Tim asks about prices for the brush guards etc. that I mentioned seeing
in Germany.  
brush guard mounts to stock front bumper - DM840
Seitenrammschutz (side crash protection) - DM590
rear spare tire mount (swings to open rear hatch) - DM350
front spare tire mount, only usable WITH brush guard above - DM450
front brush guard looks like a catcher's mask - DM1190
Projektzwo also has extremely serious-looking double-pipe bumpers that
replace the stock bumpers, but they're not in Winkler's catalog so
I don't have prices.

PS -- as I should have mentioned in the original posting, the DM is 
currently around 1.4 to the dollar.
