Subject: question about van shopping


I'm in the market for a used Vanagon, which will be my first, and I have 
a couple of questions for you seasoned veterans: 

1) I can spend $5000 including tax. Do you think I'll be able to find a 
van that feels new to me, is an '86 or newer, and has &lt;100 K miles?

2) Would it be better to buy one with a rebuilt engine or at least the 
heads redone, assuming that it usually needs to be done somewhere around 
100.000 miles?  Or if it has had this work done is it a sign the little 
pup has been driven too hot and other things will go wrong?

3) I heard there is no &quot;Idiots Guide&quot; for the Vanagon-is this true? I had 
one for a Rabbit and for a Toyota truck and I saved myself big bucks with 
the easy instructions.  

4) Lastly, does anyone have Vanagon to sell me that is within a couple 
hours of Seattle?  

Thanks!!
