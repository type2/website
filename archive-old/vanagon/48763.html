Subject: Bleeding cooling system

I just replaced the belt for the power steering pump and in doing so I had to
disconect a small coolant hose which I think is some kind of vent to the main
reservoir, do I have to bleed the cooling system? By the way the pump looks
crooked, the pulley is off line with the crank pulley, but nothing looks
bent. Has anyone seen this before or have any ideas?
