Subject: Re: Eurovan Catalytic Converter

&gt;      I have been considering trading my 1986 Vanagon GL for a 1993 Eurovan 
&gt;      and while doing some research via the Internet, came across an unhappy 
&gt;      Eurovan owner. Among other things, this individual states that as a 
&gt;      result of the catalytic converter being beneath the passenger 
&gt;      compartment, it heats the interior of the vehicle, which requires 
&gt;      running the air conditioner constantly.
&gt;      
&gt;      Has this been your experience?

Nope.  Or not that I've noticed anyway.  Course I'm always in the drivers 
seat.  Kids are usually telling me to turn down the heat or A/C as they 
work so well in the back.  Not sure where under the body the catalytic 
converter is.

Most of us with EV's are quite happy I think...
