Subject: Re:Seat Belts

&gt; All this seat belt talk has made me a little nervous. Right now
&gt; my '65 bus has the lap belt type.  I would like to put in the shoulder
&gt; belt type in the front seating area but haven't found any that would
&gt; fit or could be attached.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone know where or how I might do this? Could a later model bus's
&gt; shoulder belt be attached?&gt;

i put the automatic belts from my 84 rabbit into the bus (73 model).
everything fits, even the attachment bolts are the same ! feel a bit sorry
for the rabbit though...
