Subject: '85 Vanagon woes...

For the 6 years I have owned my 85 GL Vanagon, it has from time to time 
decided to leave me stranded by not restarting.  The usual symptom is 
that it simply will not restart after being stopped (when warm).  Each 
time I take it to the dealer, it restarts for them (because it has sat 
for a few days), and they have never been able to figure it out.  Once it 
even would not start in their driveway, but they still failed to figure 
it out.  Last summer it died in the Oregon desert, this summer it died in 
the Nevada desert.

Has anyone had a similar problem, and been able to determine the cause-

I'd love to keep the car, but my family is getting tired of rides in 
tow-trucks.
