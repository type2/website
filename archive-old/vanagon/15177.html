Well all you Roadtripping VW Van Nuts, If you don't live in Eastern
Canada or near New England, Sorry, this probably isn't for you.
But,  Christian, David Carment, Other Easterners...
On May 5th or 6th I will be setting off from Toronto in a squeaky
85 Vanagon on my way to Boston Massachusetts (or vicintity).
Now, I know very little about that area (the main reason for the trip 
is to visit my Brother in Boston) but I would love to postpone seeing
my brother until the weekdays if it meant catching a campout with some
of you folks around Cape Cod (Christian... Suggest somthing else if
you know of anything better.)
Mr D. Carment,  Can I meet you in Ottawa? Gananoque (sp) ? or somewhere?
and have company for the trip?  
Michael Heron... Are you sure you can't be convinced?
Don't worry Michael, It's east, Your bus won't have to climb the Niagara
escarpment or anything.  :)
Frank C... How about it?
And I know that there are at least 8 other Ontarians on this list...
How about it folks?
Vermontians?  New Hamsters? New Englanders?

Let's give it a shot.


Cheers
