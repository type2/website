Subject: Insulation?

I recently went to a VW junkyard looking for parts and found a bus that 
had the inner panels removed and appeared to have house insulation 
between the outer wall and the inner panelling. Anybody ever heard 
of/tried this? Being in Seattle, I'm looking for any way to stay warmer 
this winter.

Thanks,
