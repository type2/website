Subject: Lansing MI 3/3 show reminder

Hi Volks,

        just a quick reminder:  we'll be meeting at the Big Boy restaurant
parking lot on westbound Plymouth Rd. at highway 23 (exit 41) in Ann Arbor,
MI at 9:00am this Sunday, 3/3.  We'll hit the road for Lansing by 9:15,
making a pit stop in Webberville to pick up Dan Z. &amp; friends.  I'll provide
maps to Dan's place so's nobody gets lost. :)  Should show up at the
Lansing Center round 'bout 10:30 when the doors open.

        (Doug C.:  should we page you?  Will you be there?  Anybody else
coming from a different direction &amp; want to meet up?  Drop me a line!)
