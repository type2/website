Subject:  high idle all of a sudden

went on an adventure in the adventurewagen this weekend in northern
michigan with my mom - she loved it!  (when i was little, mom &amp; dad used
to have a bored-out 69 bus with home-done conversion, she liked my
homebrew pseudo-westy conversion better).  roamed around, enjoying
the vertical relief of the 'back roads'.  hiked and found a blueberry patch
and saw other cool stuff (including an earlier wasserboxer with alaska
plates, whose driver waved!).

unfortunately, i noticed that my idlle was around 1500 rpm,  most of the
time.  also, i noticed the beginning of an exhaust leak on the passenger
side (a tapping noise coupled with an intermittent chirping while
accelerating in 1st and 2nd).  could these phenomena be connected in
some way, or do i have two distinct problems?  what might be a direction
for me to pursue in checking out the idle?  i have no experience with this
sort of stuff and am kind of overwhelmed by the amount of stuff in the
manuals, want to learn but need some direction.  thanks again to those
who helped me with the pilot bearing problem last time, and thanks in
advance for any suggestions this time.
