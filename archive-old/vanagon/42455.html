Subject: wheels &amp; oil temp. gauge

Hello all,
Today I finally got around to painting my bus's wheels.  All the paint was
pretty much gone except for what was covered by the hubcaps.  I went to Advance
Auto and got some plasti-kote acrylic enamel, in silver.  Matched the original
beautifully and now the wheels look really really sharp.  Makes the bus look
great!

As it gets warmer out I'm thinking more of installing an oil temp gauge.  Two
questions:  where should I locate the sender?  I want a location that will
report a fairly accurate oil temperature but that will not be too much of a pain
to install.  I would also prefer the gauge to read high than to read low, but
accuracy would be a plus.

Second:  where should I locate the gauge?  I like Sami's setup, with the gauge
in the space above the ashtray &amp; below the radio, but I'm not into metal cutting
(this is a '78 by the way).  Mounting it under the dash to either side of the
steering column is no good because the steering wheel blocks my vision there
when I'm driving straight ahead.  Any ideas?

Thanks,
Sean
