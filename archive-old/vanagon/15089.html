Subject: Leaky Heads Revenge

I have some hard info on the head fiasco, although I apologize for not being
able to find my paperwork.  If I run across it later I'll post it.

There is possible reimbursement from VW for the leaky head gaskets.

VW went to binding arbitration in the late eighties in lieu of (or maybe
because of)a class action suit.  It seemed that all the WC vanagons started
leaking by 100,000 miles.  Worse, an electrolytic action was pitting the heads
at the gasket so deeply that they could not be machined and put back on.  New
gaskets are $1000 (around here, installed and warrantied), and new heads and
gaskets was $2500.  Ouch.

There is a mediation program available through VW usa (1-800-822-vwus) that
follows their secret reimbursement plan.  A friend of mine was reimbursed for
a portion of his gasket replacement cost on one side(maybe %25), and the full
gasket and head cost on the other side, where a small casting crack was
discovered during repair.  He had an 86 synchro with 82,000 miles on it, and
it was 1989 when the engine failed.

My 1985 Camper head gaskets failed in 1990 at about 90,000 miles, and I had to
replace both heads and gaskets. By the way, NEVER OVERHEAT THE BUS!  STOP
DRIVING IMMEDIATELY!  I saved my block this way.  Anyway, I got the
documentation from VW but was discouraged from expecting response because of
the high mileage.  I never sent it in.   In retrospect, I should have followed
through, which is why I'm writing this to you...

If you run into this problem, or have recently had it, call 800-822-VWUS and
ask for customer service and the arbitration claim forms.  Do not let them
tell you that they don't know what you're talking about.  A dealer cannot help
you, but it helps, for reimbursement purposes, to have had the work done at a
dealer.

They will ask for all pertinent records (reciept for repair performed,
possibly service records).  It may void the warranty to use non-VW antifreeze
in the bus.  Standard antifreeze is supposed to be corrosive to the Vanagon
Waterboxer.  Don't use it.  Don't tell 'em you did.
(Maybe somebody here can enlighten us on this point.)

For those of you who have read this far, a survey.  Howabout a post about the
history of your leaky (or for the lucky, non-leaky) waterboxer.  May I suggest
this form.

In the body copy, be sure to include present mileage, and any subsequent
head/gasket replacement.
