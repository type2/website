Subject: Rotating Front Seats

The Westy front seats do get difficult to turn due to sand and grit in the
tracks.  It is easy to slide the seat out of the forward/aft tracks and
remove the bolts holding those tracks.  Lift off the steel plate and clean
the circular groove and coat with grease.  Replace and it will rotate
easily.  When I did this on my old 84 both seats revolved so well that they
went from side to side about 1/4&quot; as we went around corners!  Go easy on
the grease and do not tighten the hold down blots too tightly.  Use those
bolts to adjust to a satisfactory firmness of rotation.
