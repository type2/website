&gt;Do I have to purge out all the old stuff, or can I simply drain it,
&gt;and pour synthetic stuff in?


There isn't any compatibility problems with mixing 'regular' and the 
synthetic oils, however, just for peace of mind it would be nice to 
get as much of the old 'worn and contaminated' oil out as possible.  
I see there's some suggestions coming thru  on how to get the oil 
into the tranny.  I've done it by attaching a piece of flexible hose 
to the spout on the 'squeezable' quart oil bottle and just squeezing the bejeebers 
out of the container.
