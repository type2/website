Mark,

If you make your Vanagon so that it is not worth stealing, it probably 
won't worth having either!  Your comment makes me think of a car that I saw 
at the grocery store the other day.  It was a banged up and rusted Buick Le 
Sabre (fwd type) that had a &quot;club&quot; installed on the steering wheel.  I 
laughed because just the look of the car was enough of a theft deterrent. 
 I can't imagine what they were trying to protect.

Volks,
I have thought about this, the theft situation and Vanagons and am
considering installing right-hand drive from South Africa to make my
Vanagon undesirable to a thief. Not only would my Vanagon be undesirable
to steal, but -if- stolen, I would merely find out which mailman could
not be accounted for at the time my Vanagon would be stolen! Clever huh?
What do you Volks think?
