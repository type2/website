Please tell me its got grey headrests in the back seat....

Somehow the previous owner of my '87 weekender lost a headrest.
My back bench/bed has room for three, but only has two....Big deal you
say???.... Me too!!!  I don't know why it bugs me cause i never sit in the
back, but almost every time i look in the rear view mirror, i mentally count
to two!!!
