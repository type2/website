&gt;if the bus has original safari windows (w/ corresponding wipers that fold
&gt;down to let you open the windows) these are *highly* desireable. they go
&gt;for about $450.00 us for the aftermarket repros. FWIW safari windows are
&gt;known to leak.
&gt;
&gt;from what you describe the bus sounds worth the cash the guy is asking.
&gt;straight unbent/rusted gates are preety hard to come by too.
&gt;
&gt;no major rust on theis baby?? has it been repainted??

Hi Michael,

        I couldn't find any evidence of rust anywhere except for the crack
or separation at the bed deck / side wall seam.  This looked a little
suspicious, as the entire length of the drivers side showed a crack at this
point where body and bed come together.  Some evidence of bondo in this
crack, but I couldn't probe around.  Everything felt solid, though.

        Has a nice two-tone paint job that is definitely recent, but nicely
done.  I was able to look at the undercarriage while it was on the hoist,
and saw no visible signs of corrosion or sheet metal failure.  I think that
the brake fluid resevoir cover is missing, but that's about it.

        The leaky safari windows may pose a problem here in the northwest. &lt;g&gt;
