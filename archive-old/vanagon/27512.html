Subject: re:Camping and the Military (was vanagon heat)

&lt;snip some stuff about loud generators,and being heard rather than seen&gt;
&gt;Let's take a poll.  Any vanagon list people veterans of Army or Marines
&gt;and still interested in camping?

Actually I still like to camp.  I was in Air Defense (Stinger Missile
Crewmember)  We were in a team of 2 people in an M113 Armored personnel
carrier.  These things are designed to carry 13 people and all their
gear, so we had more than enough room. Though in the winter it would be
colder inside than outside due to all the thick metal.  Unfortunately
though I did sleep in one of those monster tents only one time. We towed
my APC out to the field once because the mechanics were more likely to
get parts to fix it out in the field, than back on base.  In fact, we
could take any parts we needed from other units out in the field, when
ever we needed. Only if VW garages, and junk yards worked the same way
:-(

Cheers,

David
