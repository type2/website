I went to pass emmissions with my 78 westy stock, with the exception of
mufflers.  The testers were extremely incompetent, as one couldn't figure
out how to run the computer, and the other entered my car as a 78 rabbit
truck.  During the test, the operator could not get my car to go over 40
MPH on the dyno!  The screen flashed &quot;underpowered, test canceled&quot;!  After
this, they tried to take an idle sample.  The screen this time read &quot;sample
dilution&quot;  after 15 or 20 minutes of this, the manager told me either my
exhaust was bad (brand new) or my mixture was way too rich (18mpg).  On the
way out the operator took me aside and told me for $50 the car would pass,
and that he would take care of it tonight.  Can anyone smell a rat?

I am going to my garage to verify my idle mixture, and then am calling the
state to file my charges.  

Also on the way home fronm the garage, some moron hits me and bent up my
new exhaust &quot;i've got a welder at my shop, let me put a bead on it!!&quot;  I
dont' think so!

hope everyone else is having a better day
