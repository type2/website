Subject: 1987 High Idle

Hi all,
On Monday morning I started my '87 Syncro to discover an &quot;idle&quot; speed of 4400
RPM.  I drove the van for close to three hours and the problem was
consistant.  I've switched out the Idle Stabilizer Control Valve with one
known to be good and had the same problem.  Next I disconnected the pair of
wires attached to the Idle Stabilizer Control Valve and the van idled
normally while warm.  I suspect that this means that I have a problem with
the Idle Control Module or perhaps the throttle position switch. 

Any suggestions, other that these two items?

Thanks,
Jim Davis
