Note:  My home server is down indefinately, so I can only give updates from
work.
	
	Friday night:  Blocked out the nose and driver/passenegr doors, shot
surfacing primer on them, pre-dis-assembly dry run (made sure things I 
want to take loose will come loose when I need them to) 

	Saturday: Bought the rest of the paint and supplies (minus some stuff 
like cleanup thinner and tac rags) so I am just need to get the body prep
done.  Here's my paint shopping list:

	2 quarts  Deltron DBU Cessna Vestal White    $60
	1 gallon  DRR Reactive reducer
	1 gallon  DAU 8200 Clear                           
	2 quarts  DU 5 Hardener                      $75
	1 gallon  DT 1170 reducer     
	1 gallon  DEL-SEAL sealer                    $45
    1 quart   glazing stuff w/catalyst           $20
	
                                       Total:   $305
	
	I then napped the afternoon away.

	Sunday:  Helped friend with datsun roadster bodywork, welded and filled
holes in dash, removed bed, sealed floor-wall joint that was behind the bed,
miscellaneous spot painting inside, caulked up area under bus behind the nose
where the floor meets the front.

	The paint guy talked me into getting the DAU 8200 clear instead of the
DAU 82.  Its a higher solids product, dries faster, and is s'posed to
be harder.  It was also $10 cheaper.  I figgure if he sells it so hard,
and its less money for him, there  must be a reason.  Other clears available
are the 2020 and 2001 clears, but they dry slow and very slow respectively,
which gives them more gloss, etc, but you need a booth to get it nice.
