Subject: Re:  cruising speed


&gt;That was an informative reply to the question about reasonable cruising 
&gt;speed in an air cooled vanagon.  Could you share some thoughts with the 
&gt;list about reasonable speeds for the water cooled crowd?  
&gt;
&gt;In my ignorance I've adopted the magic number of 62 mph as a 
&gt;zero-headwind cruise speed, with a downshift to 3rd (and drop to 50 mph) 
&gt;when I can't hold speed on a grade with less than 3/4 throttle.  This 
&gt;&quot;feels&quot; safe for the engine, if feelings count for anything, but I'd be 
&gt;curious as to your (and other's) opinion as to where the danger zones 
&gt;start (in terms of rpm and engine load) for the wasserboxer.

I own an 86 Vanagon syncro 160,00 on the clock. I driver to and from work,
25 miles one way.  I run between 70 and 75 most days.  If weather is bad or
windy (head wind) I run at 65.

     I realy enjoy the list, don't change a thing.  Its amazing how much in
come we have.  Anyone for eggs and spam?
