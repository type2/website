Subject: Re: Low RPM drift/surge, what is it?

I concur on idle speed at about 800-900 rpm.  I am pretty sure this is stated
in Bentley, as well.

Tonya, maybe your idle speed is set too high?

&gt; &gt; &gt; I have an '87 GL Wolfs. I have not had it very long. It seems to run
rough
&gt; &gt; &gt; at low RPMs. It idles at about 800. If I try to nudge it up to 1100 or
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1200 RPM it seems to drift and surge.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Is this characteristic of anything in particular?

&gt; &gt; Gordon,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The idle should be at about 800-900 rpm, trying to force it to run
&gt; &gt; faster will confuse the electronics.

&gt; Are you sure about the 800-900?  Mine idles around 1100-1200 (when it is
&gt; behaving).
