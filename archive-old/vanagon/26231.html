&gt;Does anybody know if one of these shop air compressors you're talking about
&gt;will drive a pressure washer??

?? i thought the &quot;pressure washers&quot; had little compressors of their own ...
which was why they cost so much.  not so?  anybody seen an accessory for
a shop air compressor that would turn it into a &quot;pressure washer&quot;??? i sure
could use something like that. :)
