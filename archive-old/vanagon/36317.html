Clara,
	The mystery bus is RHD?  This could be the clue to the story.  I 
have a RHD 1966 Westfalia that has the emergency flashers, tail 
lights,bumpers and other details included only (I think) on North American 
Westfalias.  It was built some months later than many of its parts.  
Maybe RHD buses were cobbled together at some far corner of the plant in 
Hanover as the market required them?  I got my '66 from the original 
owners here in Christchurch.  They bought it new in Germany and shipped 
it to Montreal for one year before it came to NZ.  Maybe it needed to 
have the US DOT equipment in order to be used in Canada?  I've never 
checked all of the numbers to deepen the mystery of my bus.  I am 
planning on shipping it back to the States when I move back home in 
July.  Gary Gibson
