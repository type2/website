Subject: Joel: Change the Stats &amp; Mainshaft ?

Hi Vanagon Listers,

I just ran across a cheap 84 Vanagon with a bent mainshaft (4-speed).  
All else appears to be fine.  The tranny's partially disassembled and the 
wasserboxer is still in the van.  Hopefully it won't take too much work 
to get it back together.  I've yet to get an understandable reason from 
the PO on why the mainshaft became bent.  Anybody ever run across this 
problem?
