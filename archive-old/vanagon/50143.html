Subject: Syncro Driveshaft Questions

After searching the archives about Syncro driveshaft vibrations I've come to
the conclusion that I'm gonna need to replace mine. I already changed the UV
joints, and the vibe. is still present. What I'd like to find out is where I
can locate a replacement.Do Ineed to go to a dealer or is there an after
market source?
 Any help or even any other tips are as usual greatly appreciated.
