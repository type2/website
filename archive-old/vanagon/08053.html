Hmmm...

Well, I am officially looking for a Syncro Westy, (west of the Mississippi,
if any one knows of one) and was thinking I should stay away from dealers
to keep out of the poorhouse. Maybe I should stick WITH dealers, and
buy a used car warrantee to keep out of the poorhouse....

&gt;The first syncro westy I had was an '87 and I had about $20,000 of warranty
&gt;bills on it before I crashed it into a deer and it was totalled. (all the
&gt;parts are now in the attick)

&gt;The second syncro westy I had was a '90 and I have had about $15,000 of
&gt;warranty bills on it so far, including a brand new syncro trans at $4,000.
&gt;Needless to say, I don't have to pay these warranty bills.

&gt;I have another three years left to go on the warranty and will attempt to
&gt;drive VW out of the US market paying to fix my van.

&gt; I love this car to death.
