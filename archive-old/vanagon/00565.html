&gt; just my $.02 - i think any competent locksmith could handle rekeying event he
&gt; 'older German cars' someone posted recently -

 I did this myself on my '71 camper- the aircooled VW locks are pretty simple
and it isn't that hard to do. I used the ignition key as the starting point,
because I didn't fancy disassembling that cylinder, and reset the rest of my
locks to match- it's great to have just the one key!

Cheers,
        W.
