Subject: Re: Power &amp; Heat;89Vanagon

&gt;1988 Caravelle 2.1litre 7 seater bus&lt;
same as mine a year older
I didn't thing the 2.1 could tow so much, but still..in this yukky 
SoCal heat..I wont chance it!
&gt;
When not loaded or towing, pushing the excelerator hard is quite
exhilarating as the van roars away from traffic lights etc.&lt;

tell me about it! especially a stickshift. I fly past people all the 
time. And there are some bozos here who drive them like they have no 
power! Im flying by _at_ 80 on the freeway, and they're putting _at_ 60 
unloaded!
