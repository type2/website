Subject: Re: Clutch pressure plate

     

     
     In your description of working on the clutch you mention this:
     
     &quot;It keeps it free from rust and sends a subtle message to the guy doing the 
     balancing.&quot; 
     
     I put a long block in recently, and changed the throwout bearing, and both plate
     and disk.  Should I have had them balanced before sticking it back in ?
     
     'yikes!'
