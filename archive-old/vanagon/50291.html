Subject: Re: SOund/heat insulation

&gt;     I did the same thing. The only thing I thought of later is will
&gt;     the insulation settle? But in the mean time it works great!

I've used household fibreglass insulation,R-12,  3.5&quot; deep, 15&quot; wide batts
48&quot; long. Fits all vanagon cavities perfectly, just cut to shape.  I've also
used 'real' sound deadening FG insulation.  It's about twice as dense.  The
household stuff is light enough that the pieces don't slump. The
soundproofer was too heavy and pulled down a bit.  The presence of
condensation moisture will increase the weight of both dramatically and it
will slump if badly wet.

  I always use a vapour barrier, 8mil or even 12 mil polyethylene, held in
place via double sided tape 1&quot; wide, then snap the VW panels back on.  Seal
the cavity as tightly as possible, if you need to overlap pieces duct tape
the seams.  This is important unless you like rust, oh... and spray the
cavity with a non-hardening oily type rust proofer a day ahead and let it
seep well in. Later you can see it seep out via those body seams we see
rusted along, so you know it's working. My van is a bit messy there between
washes, but no further rust developments. tim
