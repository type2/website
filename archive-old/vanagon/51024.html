Subject: Re: Unstick Lock Key Holes?

VW lock tumblers are easily fixable. Although sometimes it is not so easy
removing them to work on them. On the Vanagon remove the inner door panel
and in the area of the handle from the inside of the door there are 2
screws that hold the handle on. 4mm allen I think. Remove the handle. On
the inside of the handle you will see a phillips head screw, it is opposite
of the key. remove this screw and the tumbler assembly should come out of
the handle. You will probably have to play with it to get it out because of
the key not going all the way in. You then see the little brass tumblers.
Work on them to get them to move. DON'T mix them up. There are small
springs in under the tumbler so watch out. After you get them all to move
freely insert the key, if none of the tumblers stick out of the tumbler
assembly grease it up and reinstall it. If some of the tumbler are still
sticking out you have a few choices. Replace the tumbler piece, not the
assembly, VW does have them available but I don't think any dealer will
have them. File down the tumbler until it is flush with the outside of the
tumbler assembly or remove the offending tumbler and discard it. The last
two choices do make it so some other keys will also work, the file method
is less likely to have the other keys work. But, like I used to tell my
customers, who is going to try their key anyway. And the ignition key will
still be fully tumbled.

&gt;My newly purchased '85 Westy has door locks that will work from the

&gt;and to just keep squirting WD-40 into them untill they freed up then use 
&gt;a good lube spray.  I have tried this several times-no luck. The only way 
&gt;I can lock up is to lock the two front doors &amp; slider then crawl through 
&gt;the back hatch and lock that (thaat one works!) Not a pretty sight!
&gt;Any suggestions?  (Was always parked near salt water)
