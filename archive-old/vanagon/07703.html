&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Okay! I called the dealer (Lasher VW in downtown Sac.) and he has the original
&gt;&gt;plastic screw and the metal screw that is suppose to replace it.  However,
&gt;&gt;the parts person says that he would he wasn't crazy about putting in a 
&gt;&gt;metal screw for fear of damaging the plastic casement.  Any comments on
&gt;&gt;this?  I'm going to buy both since they're only $7.15 all told.  Anybody
&gt;&gt;out there have any problem with the metal screw.  I could see it if you
&gt;&gt;torqued it to tight, but if it's just snug I don't see a problem.
&gt;&gt;

I had a metal screw put in there a couple of years ago. The original plastic
one had a minor leak. It broke up into useless when I tried to tighten it.
My dealer gave me a metal one. I thought it was over kill but put it on
anyway. I think it works fine.
