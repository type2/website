Dull and boring?!  I think not!  :)

Unfortunately I am a recent member and I don't believe I was included in this 
count.  I am in San Jose, CA and have a '64 Deluxe.  I would love to know some 
of the other people in the bay area who have split-windows.  Send me private e-
mail and maybe we can swap parts and info.
