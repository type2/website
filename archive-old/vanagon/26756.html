Subject: Re: Maintenance Intervals

&gt;One of the surprises when I bought my 86 GL new almost a decade ago was the
&gt;lack of a specified service interval for several items.  I have noticed
&gt;discussion on this lst recently about the lack of a replacement interval for
&gt;coolant.  There seems to be consensus to do it (but less on what to do it
&gt;with).  Incidentally I decided to replace mine every three years, and use
&gt;the VW stuff, and have had only a few tiny leaks.

I found a small, but costly item to check on a regular basis: the
windshield washer fluid container! It can build up a algae growth and clog
the pump motor if you don't take out the container and clean it every once
in a while, and fill with fresh cleaner fluid.
