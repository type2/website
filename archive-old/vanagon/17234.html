Subject:      syncros for sale: already sold :(

ok. being the incurable snoop that i am, i called that number in kentucky
and sure enough, that's the place. the bad news is: they already sold both
syncros. :(

they did say that their old 1983 camper is still in Louisville, KY and still
for sale (at the dealer? i guess).

sorry to get your hopes up, folks.

you'll never guess who bought BOTH of them ... Tom Brouillette (sp?) of
that rent-a-camper Roamin' Holiday bunch in new mexico!! :)
