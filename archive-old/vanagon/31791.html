Subject: heaters and propane

Volks,
	I've been wanting to install a vented propane heater in my bus for
some time.  One thing I am wondering about though.  Those of you that
have installed them, are you using the stock propane tank?  The little
dinky one?  My '73 Safare has a slightly larger tank than the Westy (3
gallons) but I don't think I could get more than two nights worth of
heat out of it.  If I'm camping in the snow in the boonies for a week,
how the heck am I gonna get propane?  Has anyone installed a larger tank
in their bus?  I was thinking about installing another small tank on the
other side of the bus, opposite the existing one, for maybe 4 nights
worth of heat, but even this is not ideal.  I'd like to have 1-2 weeks
worth of heat.  What to do?

-David
