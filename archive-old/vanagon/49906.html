Hello,

I am now the very happy owner of a 1982 Bus (sometimes known as Caravelle
in the UK, Vanagon in the US) with 9 seats, air-cooled 1970cc engine with
124000 miles, and two sunroofs! Interestingly all its past (and present)
owners including the dealer are Christians. I would usually buy privately
but Bilbo (the dealer) gave a 3 month warranty and part exchanged my
Citroen CX 25 (8 seater). I had been looking for this vehicle for over 2
years. The seats are for wife, four kids and 3 spare for friends.

How feasible is it to convert the 4 speed manual gearbox to an automatic?
This is the only feature stopping this car from being 100% perfect.

BTW I am aware of a recent split of the group - where does air-cooled
Vanagon fit in: under Type2 or Vanagon or both?
