Subject: towing

I was wondering if anybody had any experience with towing any VW bus or
truck.  I am seriously considering buying an old 1958 split window
doublecab.  It is in pretty rough shape at the moment.  I am currently at
college, and would like to tow it home (about 600 miles away).  Where could
I get a tow bar cheap? (uhaul?)  How much strain would the VW put on the
tow vehicle?  What would I have to check before leaving so something like a
wheel doesn't fall off?  Would there be a problem of the wind blowing the
VW around?  I would have to traverse the 5 mile mackinaw bridge, which is
usually extremly windy.  Also, as a side note, I was wondering what parts
place or catolog is a good source of parts for the older bus's.  Thanks for
any help.
sincerely,
derek harris
