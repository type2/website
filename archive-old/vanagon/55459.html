Not &quot;so&quot; simple. Machining the sealing surface decreases the combustion
chamber volume which increases the combustion ratio. How will this
affect FI system? Both heads would have to be done ,in equal amounts, to
keep them balanced. How will this affect valve train geometry and valve
to piston clearance?
Just wondering...
Good Luck
