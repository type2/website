Subject: Re: Roof rack?  BRIGHT colors?

for the quick release section of the roofrack, why don't you try getting
some old quick release hubs from a bike store? If the centre axle in them
is bent or broken, the stores just throw these out.


&gt;&gt;What I'm looking for is a roof-rack (it's not a pop-top) for
&gt;&gt;it, to handle the canoes, the kid, etc.  Anybody got one
&gt;                           ^^^^^^^
&gt;Yep.  I feel like tying them up there sometimes -- except they'd enjoy it...
&gt;
&gt;Seriously, we use a pair of ($22.95) roof racks from Hechingers' -- a hardware
&gt;chain up her in the Notheast.  I use a pair of strong tie-down straps to
&gt;hold the canoe down.  It is a 17' aluminum one, and the racks ave held up
&gt;well so far.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Oh, Yes, you'll need a couple of Neon colored spray paint cans for color...
&gt;
&gt;BTW, anybody know what I can do to get my bikes up there without paying
&gt;$300.00 + on the real roof racks for bikes?
&gt;
&gt;Cetin &quot;damn, it's too great a day outside to work&quot;  Seren
