Subject: RE: Sodium Valves: Your Ticket to Fame and Fortune! or something.

HHHmmmm

I have a No.3 exhaust valve and a pot with a very sizable hole sitting on my
desk 8-{.....I have pulled down a couple of 'original' 1700 Type IV engines and
found sodium valves in both of them.

I'm not sure that I'd subscribe to the theory that No. 3 valve failure was a
problem that was cured in Type IV engines......

My own personal experience with sodium filled valves suggests that a fair
proportion of them seem to break at the base when they fail (disastrously) in
Type IV engines, and that they fail *a lot*....it could be there is an inherent
weakness at this point because they are hollow???? I don't think I would ever
advise anyone to even do one grind/reseat - replace the buggers at every
available opportunity....
