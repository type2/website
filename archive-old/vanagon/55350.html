Subject: Mail Order Parts???



I was wondering if anyone knew of any companys that sold VW parts out of 
a catologe type of a setup.  I've got a 1980 Camper, and I'm sometime 
looking for parts.  Any info would be great.  

Right now I'm specificly looking for the plastic pieces on the right side 
of my van that hold the water, electric, and water tank hook up.  Mainly 
I need like two of the flaps that cover the hook ups, but it would be 
nice to just replace the whole thing on all three.

If you have any info on this or any companys you can hook me up with it 
would be greatly appriciated. 

later,
