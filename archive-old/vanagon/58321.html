Howdy Volks:

Some questions please:

1) Would you all please recommend a reputable dealer/mechanic in =
Flagstaff, AZ to have a Westy checked out? I need a really good one.

2)  I need to take a 60&quot; x 22&quot; x 48&quot; piece of furniture for a long ride. =
Would someone out there please tell me if it will fit in a Westfalia?

TIA
