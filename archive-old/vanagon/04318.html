&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Can someone tell me exactly what the vents at the bottom of the front
&gt; &gt; doors are for?  Should they be slid to the front or back to keep the air
&gt; &gt; flowing or warm the bus up? 
&gt; 

Ha!  We now have a few answers:

A.  They do nothing
B.  They blow out air similar to the dash air
C.  They suck stale air out of the cab

Well, I can say (again) that on my Syncro, they definately suck air from the 
cab and the air goes &quot;somewhere else&quot;.  It sucks enough to blow out
a lighted match at low speeds, and will consume all the smoke from a
cigarette (when traveling at high speeds, and the cig is within 6 inches
of the open part of the vent).

I've looked all around the seams of my doors, and can't find anywhere 
the air could be flowing to...  Except the Bermuda Triangle.  Maybe
someone who's vents blow _out_ could reach in and pull out Amelia
Earhart, or Flight 17, or the crew of the Mary Celeste...
