&gt;Your chassis and gen info plate does not tell you a lot; but there is a second

&gt;you can determine the EXACT date a Split rolled off the,assembly line and how
&gt;your van used look.
&gt;THis second plate can be found riveted to the bulkhead behind the drivers
&gt;seat...unless some nurd removed it in which case your stuck!

Usually referred to as the &quot;passenger seat&quot; in the U.S.  :-)

&gt;SSVC and NEATO are hoping to put all this info, including paint codes etc into
&gt;a booklet, with a lot of help from our friends in Bulli Kartei!

I've put the list published in NEATO a few months ago on my web page
http://www-personal.umich_dot_edu/~mjanello


&gt;Hopefully you can now determine whether a van is late 65'/early 66 or if it
&gt;really is 1952 not 1953......
&gt;I have a load of stuff about all this and mention it as often the exact spec
&gt;and date of a bus is wanted by people - eithr to restore or, as in my case,
&gt;just to know its past!
&gt;Happy Farghesting........Dave.
