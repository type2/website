Subject: Re: Puddles inside the bus

&gt;&gt;Hi all, new subscriber here. I need to get all the window
&gt;&gt;seal replaced (and some body work done) on my '66 bus.
&gt;&gt;Sigh, I know it's gonna cost me...does anyone have tips on
&gt;&gt;where to get the seals cheap? I've found a good, reasonably
&gt;&gt;priced body shop to do the work.
&gt;
&gt;West Coast metric makes all sorts of seals.  All of the mail order places
&gt;sell them, but they seem to be cheaper at WCM.  They also have kits,
&gt;fro various diiferent body kombos, and can put kits together for your
&gt;specific needs.
&gt;

They really are reasonable and from what others have said they are the only
ones that truly fit.

John
