Fellow List Members:

A few days ago I noticed a collection of tiny wet spots on the driveway
where I park my 91 Vanagon MV.  So I look underneath and sure enough there
appears to be a drop of coolant dangling from the right cylinder head area.

I looked all around the engine compartment and could not find any leaking
hoses or pipes, so I must assume it is coming from the lower part of the
engine.

Doesn't seem to leak much.  I assume 1 or 2 drops a minute while driving.

What is the diagnosis??  Head gasket?  

I'm the original owner and she just turned over 60000 last month.

If it is a head gasket, are we talking big bucks??
