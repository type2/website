to paraphrase Gen. Sheriden, &quot;the only GOOD politician is a dead one.&quot;
or at least, one voted out of office. :)

i, personally, believe in the one-term rule: you had your chance, now get
out and let someone else try to cheat the taxpayers.

so, after many, many years of frustration and anger at the politicians who,
in my view, have completely lost sight of the original purpose of this system
of government, i have developed a system of my own:

vote for whoever is NOT already in office.

it's that simple. i doubt that it has any effect, but if enough people did
it, perhaps the bastards might begin to get some ideas about who they are
supposed to be representing!!!

Thomas Jefferson was right!!
.... end of diatribe ....    :)
