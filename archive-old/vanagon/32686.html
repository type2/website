Subject: Call for Papers: Journal of Vanagon Addiction

Okay, now that I've got your attention...

I was just sparked with an idea. I wonder how many of you would be 
interested in seeing a brick-oriented journal. If you've ever read a 
journal, they're filled with &quot;scholarly&quot; articles and such that try to 
expand thinking about a particular field.

I enjoy reading journals because they offer snapshots current (or past)
thinking in a discipline. Wouldn't it be cool to have a brick-oriented
publication that came out twice-yearly, written by people who really had
something to say about bricks? I guess some of the newsletters do this,
but since I haven't yet joined limbo, I don't know how detailed they get.
I used to belong to SOTO, but well, you know, the newsletter seemed like a
one-van show back then. 

Topics might include particular or obscure mechanical procedures, 
reviews of particular year-models or particular features, tire selection, 
why vanagon addiction occurs more in certain geographic regions, 
coffee-making...you know, the kind of stuff we talk about here on the list.

Well, anyway, it's an idea. I'll be happy to pursue it a little further if
there's enough interest. The one catch I can think of is the cost. 
Journals tend to be expensive and I don't have any relatives in the
printing business. It would seem that it might have to be one of those
&quot;vanity&quot;  sort of publications where people pay to have their own books
printed.  The other option is to make it an on-line journal. I'm sure that
would be possible...and we could even provide printable files for people
to FTP and print their own formatted copies. 

You know how it is, sometimes an idea just sparks you and you toss it 
right out into the wind. Some float. Some fall. Such is life.
