Subject: Fw: Captain's chair for sale!...
Date: Mon, 2 Jun 1997 19:42:01 -0400



----------
&gt;
&gt; Captain's chair for sale!
&gt;     ---------------
&gt; We recently purchased a wonderfully cared for 1986 Westie, but have no
&gt; need for the captain's chair (removable middle seat in the rear). It is
in
&gt; great condition. We are asking 200.00, but will consider all offers.
&gt; Please call (310) 589-0992 and ask for Steve or Kim. We are leaving to go
&gt; cross-country July 1, so please call before then. 

This individual called me earlier today, asking about selling his center
seat from a Westy, and now I see that he just posted it on the internet. 
If he weren't so far away (California), and if it were gray instead of
brown, I'd have bought it for myself.  I thought it might interest someone
else on the list, as it's been mentioned on the list many times.  PLEASE
CONTACT SELLER DIRECTLY, NOT ME.
