Subject: Vanagon U-Joints (Ad in VW Mag)

I could hardly believe my eyes to see the follwing ad in one of the current
VW mags: 

------------------------------------------------------
ATTENTION VANAGON OWNERS! 
DON'T GET THE SHAFT!
IF ALL YOU NEED IS NEW U-JOINTS
Volkswagen does not sell just U-Joints. If you break, crack or wear out a
U-Joint on your Vanagon the dealer or your mechanic will tell you they have
to replace the entire drive line for about $500.  Don't let them do it. Six
States Distributors now offers replacement U-Joints for Vanagons. 
NOW ONLY $49.95
Call Toll Free 1-800-453-2022
----------------------------------------------------------

This ad is silly because: 

1. So far as I know, only the syncros have U-Joints, not other Vanagons, so
most people reading this ad wouldn't know what they are talking about.
2. You don't have to replace the &quot;entire drive line&quot; (god forbid!)--they
mean &quot;drive shaft&quot;
3. They will get *no* calls on this ad (I bet) as very few syncro owners
read this magazine and happen to have a bad drive shaft at the same time.
They will feel frustrated and stop trying to market this item. 

So write down the information now cause you probably won't see the ad again. 

Anyway, Dan, this would be a source for you. But you've already replaced
yours so don't bother.
