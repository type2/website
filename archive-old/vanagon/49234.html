&gt; &gt; &gt; Greetings from the red neck riviera,Panama City ,FL.  has anyone
&gt; &gt; &gt; addressed the misting or haze that developes inside vanagon headlights
&gt; &gt; &gt; and how to clean it out. :-)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;    I have had the same problem in my Syncro. I just removed the lens,
&gt; &gt;    pured  windshield washer cleaner into it, shook it real good, washed
&gt; &gt;    it out with a water real good. Dryed it with compressed air, and it
&gt; &gt;    looks as good as new!
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; ERIC: thanks for info, did you take the lens off the metal frame or just 
&gt;  remove the headlight asb.,remove bulbs assembly?
&gt; 
     REmoved both lens (high and low) and metal frame assembly all
     at once.  4 screws will do that. 2 wire plugs: 1 for each bulb.
     The low beam: it's just a 9004 bulb(simple). The high beam
     gets a little more complicated. Don't touch the bulbs! Handle them 
     by the lamp base. Touching the bulb will cause premature dead to
     the bulb.
                  Have fun      Eric Zeno
