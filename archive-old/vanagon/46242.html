&gt; Subject: VW credit card
&gt; Got a call over the weekend from MBNA and accepted a credit card that
builds
&gt; toward a $3,500 potential rebate on a VW product. Normally I blow these
things
&gt; off but since the &quot;new beetle&quot; might be a real car, and Lord knows I
charge
&gt; enough, and I happen to have a newly teen-aged daughter, I thought that
&gt; possibly all these threads might converge a few years hence.

Poor Richard &quot;Wandering Hippie&quot; Palmer turned me on to this VW Visa this
past
year.  Be sure to get the &quot;standard&quot; and not the &quot;gold&quot; card - the VW
graphic on
the card is much better!  I don't use it much but do show it off to other VW
owners.
RMMW has one too.
