Subject: Questions, questions, questions

I'm new to the vanagon world (but have owned a '65 and '67 bus, but that was
decades ago) and would like to toss this out to the experts.
I'm looking at an '84 Westy, 120k miles, heads redone 2 yrs./20k ago, 4
speed, very straight body with only one little bubble of rust at the corner
of a side window, nice interior, unsure of the poptop (I'll know more
tomorrow when I drive it), owned past several years by a couple in their
70's, A/C hasn't worked for ~5 years.  I've crawled under and around it and
there are no signs of leaks, bottom damage, etc.

When I go to drive it, what specific things should I look for?  What are '84
Vanagons known for having problems with?

The asking price is $6500, which seems a bit high, but this is the Seattle
area.  What do you think of the price?

I plan on driving across the mountains, so power, handling, and braking will
need to be at their best.  What modifications/additions can I make to improve
these?  Will parts from later models fit (i.e., wider alloy wheels, largers
brake discs)?

Suggestions?  Comments?

If any of you Northwesterners are near Bellingham and want to offer 'personal
service', let me know.  I'd sure appreciate it.

Thanks,
Tom
