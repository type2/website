Speaking of too much heat...

When I had my '80 Vanagon a few years ago, I mounted one of those Ebenspacher 
BN-4's under the rear most passenger heat. I added a T-fitting to the fuel line 
before the pump, and ran the wiring up to a switch that I mounted on the side of 
the passenger seat base. The exhaust was vented out through a hole I drilled in 
the floor. It worked wonderfully! In fact, when I sold the Van, you had better 
believe I took that little gem right back out!

For the question of how to adjust the heat on those BN-4's:
There is a small set screw on the side of a fuel regulator that sits on top of 
the heater. Loosen the lock-nut and turn the screw *slightly* to change the rate 
of fuel delivery. The more fuel, the hotter it runs. Don't allow too much in, or 
you will get clouds of black smoke from it burning too rich.
