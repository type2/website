Subject: 87 vanagon exaust ??

I went under my newly acquired '87 Westfalia last evening to change the
two $10. gaskets between the manifold pipes and the right angle connector
piece and ended up removing the entire exaust system.  The pipe to the
catalylic converter was broken at the flange, the rear manifold pipe was
broken at the connector flange, the muffler was quite rusted everywhere,
the tail-pipe was quite not there and the muffler straps were, well they
wer not is better.  So...... my question to those of you in the know for
CANADA is where do I get a complete, new exaust system at a resonable
price.  I'm sure the VW dealer is going to ask in the thousands of dollars
for all those pieces, especially if the gaskets are $10.00 each and the
tail-pipe is $65.00.    Gotta be a jober supply somewhere, I HOPE !

Cheers,

Frank
