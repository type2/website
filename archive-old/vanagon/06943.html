&gt;who knows of what magazines out there, specifically 
&gt;ones dedicated to vw's (and buses if you know of one)?
&gt;i know there is a british magazine

Allow the TGIF runner-up to announce that 'VW Motoring' is a 
superb read.  It's a British mag, covers all things VW (from 
air-cooled to ... anything beginning with Z.)  It's monthly 
with a useful problems page and, I'm delighted to say, covers 
Transporters and campers quite often.  I'm addicted to the 
writing style.  It is really well written.

Another one is 'Volkwagen Audi CAR' (capitals intentional) 
which covers much the same type of stuff.  I feel that it is 
more suited to the drivers of smaller Veedubs (Golfs, Jettas, 
Audis, etc.)

I can post the direct snail-mail addresses for these mags if 
you wish.  I'm sure that they would air-mail them directly to 
anywhere in the world.

After Joel's comment (thanks, BTW.  Made me feel good!), here 
is a pronunciation guide for my TGIF entry :)
Taim : Tau-im
Gluaistean : Glue-ish-tau-in
Innealtoir : In-ill-tore
Freisin : Fresh-in

Perhaps I'll win it next time! :)

Shponfirkle,  (Tazmanian Bushrat word - can mean anything!)

*** Ennis, Ireland.  A weird place to live.
*** Viva the Bushrats!    ***   Go Dale, #3!
*** So, we've no government.  Yippee!
