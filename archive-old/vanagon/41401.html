Subject: LiMBO Rites of Spring...

Those of you on the list who didn't make this.... you missed a 
good time... Rics' Transporter Brown Ale was kick butt!! prudently 
waited till I got home ( after he said not to drink it on an empty 
stomach)... Geez... What a kick... Very smooth Rich flavor... Great 
stuff Ric... many thanx... Met another member of the List whose name 
escapes me( most abject apology... I'm terrible with names and somewhat 
hard of hearing, I worked with Jet aircraft too long...)saw two list 
Tee-shirt, makes me wish I had ordered one now...
	Met Several members of LiMBO Dale, Stan, Scott, and the fella 
with the beautiful Maroon EV ( show co-ordinator for Ben &amp; Jerrys this 
year) Beach was really nice, wife enjoyed taking our Beagle pup for a 
walk... Heard someone say that 35-40 Type IIs showed up over the course 
of the afternoon along with another 1/2 dozen or so other VWs...
	negotiated long and hard for the '69 Dormobile that showed up.. 
owner really doesn't want to sell, BUT... he has my card...and for those 
of you that missed it, he has a southwind gas heater mounted under the 
passenger side dash in a very slick looking install( stainless steel 
tube that the exhaust is ported thru was very very clean fabrication...) 
even the OEM stove under/behind front passenger seat worked... while 
exterior of Bus was kinda rough and interior wasn't in much better 
shape.. it was definitely a candidate for a complete 
restoration...Frame and undercarriage were Rock solid...
	oh well maybe someday...
		
		Hope to see of you Stay-at-home List Folks at either Ben 
&amp; Jerrys in VT on June 8&amp;9 or Hopkinton Fairgrounds for the NHVW club 
show June 29th &amp; 30th...
