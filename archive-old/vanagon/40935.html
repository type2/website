Subject: Re: aerodynamics (Seriously...)


&gt;Posit two Beetles. Both are identical mechanically, they have identical
&gt;bodies and they are driving down identical, perfectly flat roads. One
&gt;Beetle weighs a hundred pounds and the other weighs a thousand pounds.
&gt;
&gt;Disregarding the friction in all internal mechanical
&gt;components--considering inertia only--once they reach a certain steady
&gt;speed, will they get identical gas mileage?


Yes.
