So Mark Sabourin says:
&gt; 
&gt;  Howdy, all...
&gt;  I am a bit concerned about a part on my engine that I am unable to
&gt; identify. I have a 1.7l pancaker with dual-carbs and the part in
&gt; question is some type of heat-switch located under the engine on the
&gt; passenger's side. It's a round thing with a cable coming out (which
&gt; isn't presently connected to anything. Should I be worried about this?
&gt;  Is it part of the heating system? If so, it won't be much help any
&gt; more. (I just finished manufacturing a *COMPLETE* exhaust system out
&gt; of a set of headers, thus no more heat exchangers to worry about...)

That do-dad is the thermostat that is temperature sensitive and the
cable it is connected to is suppose to operate the flaps that direct/
restrict air from the fan housing to the engine.  I'm a die-hard fanatic
about having those flaps hooked up and working properly.  On colder
mornings it allows the engine to warm up ASAP which reduces engine
wear.  I strongly recommend that you make sure that it gets hooked
up and working.  The Bentley manual will give you the details you
need to do this.  Your gonna hear from others out there that don't
think it's worth it to hook up, but I just feel it's worth the 
trouble cause it's not that hard to do and it's not that complicated.

Cheers!
