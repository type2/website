&gt;&gt; the alternator in my 79 is about to die.  I have called around to get
&gt;&gt; price quotes on rebuilt ones.  Pep Boys has one with a lifetime
&gt;&gt; guarantee for $62.  It is not Bosch, though.  Another place has a 
&gt;&gt; Bosch one for $131 plus $30 core charge.  I then called to get a quote
&gt;&gt; on a used one from a VW mechanic.  I told him about the Pep Boys
&gt;&gt; product and what it cost, and he basically screamed saying &quot;They
&gt;&gt; just keep breaking and cause harm to the fuel injection system.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;I will never buy anything at Pep Boys again.  I've gotten too many
&gt;rebuilt parts from them in the past that have been worthless junk.

The problem of low quality rebuilds is not unique to PEP Boys.  Actually us
consumers created the problem by always looking for the cheapist way out.
 This compitition has caused all auto part suppliers to cut corners and have
the customer be the quality control department.  Think about this.  It
probably takes two hours to rebuild an alternator on the bench.  Any good
mechanic costs about $20.00/hour with benifits,(very conservative, good
benifits add cost of38% to base pay).  Now, if you can get alternator for
$60.00 and two or three suppliers handled it before it reached you, how good
can it be? I have solution to most alternator problems.  Take care to never
overload it, and every 70 to 80K, replace the brushes and inspect/replace the
bearings.  Worn brushes are usual case of failure anyway.  After two or three
rebuilds, the rotor will have to be replaced or new slip rings will need to
be installed on it.  Otherwise, an alternator will last forever as long as
the widings are not abused to cause the insulation to fail.
