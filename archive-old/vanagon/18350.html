Subject: Re: '71 Timing

&gt;OK, we're getting ready for the trip to South Carolina with the two 6 
&gt;week old kitties. Everything is pretty much set. I have a question. I was 
&gt;out working on Blushie (my '71 pop top) and installed new points, 
&gt;condenser, &amp; plugs. I think I remember somewhere that the maximum amount 
&gt;of advance at hiway speeds is 28 degrees BTDC. Is this correct? I've also 
&gt;heard a figure of around 34 degrees. I'm running a stock 1600 dual port 
&gt;with a stock carb and an 009 distributor. I set it up to go no farther 
&gt;than 28 degrees at speed and the idle kicks in around 6 degrees.
&gt;Any suggestions would be helpful. I'll be setting my Vanagon list to 
&gt;nomail sometime Friday evening, or Saturday morning, so if you would 
&gt;please e-mail me directly in case my carrier doesn't pick it up till it's 
&gt;too late. Thanks a bunch, in advance.

Captain,

Many theories abound, wanna hear some?  First off, the stock dizzy on a
stock '71 is supposed to be set to 5 degrees AFTER top dead center, this
with California smog throttle positioner.  It actually runs pretty damn well
like this.  However, and then some, most 7.1-7.3:1 engines I've seen were
set to 5-7.5 degrees before TDC, and maybe 9 degrees if the owner promised,
cross yer heart hope to die, to use premium and drive mostly on the highway.
28 at the highest advance (~2500 rpm) ain't that much unless the engine is
set-up for high compression (7.8-8:1 or higher), the dizzy alone advances 28
degrees.  So I say fooey on a 0 degree static time, (28 full advance) run
the engine till it's warm, loosen the nut, advance till it feels good, back
it off a little, lock it, check it, if it's within reason, drive it.  I use
a vacuum gauge as well.  If it pings or the temperature goes nuts, back it
off, if it doesn't, drive it, check the plug color, etc., etc.  Many
thoeries abound, all of them assume the proper valve settings, carb tuning,
fuel supply, point dwell, spark gap, etc, etc.  Bottom line; it depends on
the compression.

Eug,
'71
