&gt; &gt;Query: What are three main causes of problems or restarting an
&gt; &gt;aircooled Vanagon engine? The engine is equipped with an OXSensor and
&gt; &gt;I am wondering if the problem relates to the sensor's age (no idea),
&gt; &gt;electrical (ie coil) or the FI system (lack of fuel)? Thanks in Advance -DC
&gt; 
&gt; change the fuel filter. do it anyway.
&gt;

I bought a fuel filter that the guy at Kohlweiss said was the proper
one. It is huge and metal  and round as opposed to the original filter
that was plastic square and small. It seems to work well (about 5
dollars extra on the market). The only problem is that the ends did
not quite match the tube from the tank so i needed to usextra clamps
to get a tight and proper fit.

The OXS sensor sounds more likely or possibly that diaphragm you were
discussing. Any way to test each of these. ie How does one &quot;test&quot; and
OXS sensor and what do they cost to replace?

PS- the engine has only 8 thou on it. but all the elctrical and FI
stuff was taken from the old engine. FI injectors work well (spray is
misty and fine).
 
&gt; ~~~also check all the little electrical connectors in and around the engine
&gt; area. you might be just getting some corrosion on the spade lugs.
&gt; 
Hoipefully no corrosion .....yet.

&gt; &gt;I have noticed sometimes if I let the engine idle a few minutes before
&gt; &gt;shutting down that chnaces of a resstart are improved.
&gt; &gt;The engine start first time when cold BTW.
&gt; 
&gt; well, there goes my theory about the thermo-time switch.
&gt; 
&gt; i'd replace the oxy sensor just for paranoia's sake. it sort of sounds like
&gt; the quick shutdowns might be loading up the sensor with unburned fuel or
&gt; something like that.
&gt; 
&gt; there is one other little thing ... a little round can on the fuel loop
&gt; that runs around to the injectors. it is a pressure regulator that lets fuel
&gt; go back to the tank. if it gets weak, it can leak the pressure in that loop
&gt; and the fuel pump has to run a while (cranking) to build up the pressure.
&gt; but the slow shutdown kinda doesn't sound like this.
&gt; 

Any idea what these cost?

&gt; change the fuel filter and the oxy sensor. what the heck. they needed
&gt; changing anyway. :)
&gt; What is their expected life span- will idle and fuel consumption
become less reliable over time if they are not replaced?
Thanks - DC
