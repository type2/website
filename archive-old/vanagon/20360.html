Subject: Re: Midwest Gathering

&gt;&gt;Did I miss something?  Is this actually going to happen?  If not, may I 
&gt;&gt;suggest we meet a BBTA on Labor Day weekend.  Can't get much more Midwest 
&gt;&gt;than that and it is already an established Bus gathering.  If we want to 
&gt;&gt;meet sooner, Iowa sounds good to me.

Help me out here, I am still green to this VW thing, what is BBTA and were
might one be found.  Depending on location Labor Day weekend sounds
interesting.
