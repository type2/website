I'm back :)
Over my break I tryed to get the Retrowestie finished for its first major 
trip (New Mexico), which has been postponed until May.
First I fixed the leak in the rear heater (finally!)- I installed a new 
core ($150 don't do this unless you're sure it's the core which is 
leaking)The problem on mine was the connection between the core and the 
valve. there are two plates, the one connected to the valve has a 
partially inset square-section o-ring which I replaced ($2.50) and just 
to be sure, I put some Blue Goo around the rest of the connection 
Sofarsogood :)
Next I took to fixing the front blower motor- I won't go into detail 
about taking off the dash unless someone asks, suffice it to say, it's a 
royal pain where the sun don't shine, and i don't want to have to do it 
again....
When I finally got the motor out, i cleaned it and soaked the bearings in 
sewing machine oil overnight.  it took a day or two for the bearings to 
loosen again, but it seems to work now!.... or it did until yesterday:
something is wrong with the circuit running the fan motors F&amp;R and the 
window washers/wipers. I warmed up the bus last night and they worked, as 
I was loading it with my stuff, and the fans had stopped, but when I 
drove off everything worked again. This morning everything worked until I 
drove off and for five and a half hours from Hartford to Syracuse I had 
no active heat and no way to wash off all the salt spray the Trucks 
splashed on my windshield.....the fuse is fine, could it be a relay or a 
loose wire? Where?
