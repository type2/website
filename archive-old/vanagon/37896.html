Subject: Re: Pros and Cons: Eurovan Camper, '95 &amp; '96

&gt; It would be my primary vehicle as well as my camper. I'm not a power demon, and
&gt; the V-4 seemed OK. (Though rumor has it that a V-6 is in the offing for later
&gt; this year.)

V-4?  Not the In-line 5?

&gt; Price being flung about is $32K. This, of course, includes the Winnebago
&gt; conversion.

Sounds like a reasonable price - but that is pure guess...

&gt; Are you happy with your Eurovan Campers?  Do they suffer from the electrical
&gt; problems that seems to have plagued earlier Eurovans (info from Consumer
&gt; Reports)? 

Never trust Consumer Reports.  Electrical problems?  There are other 
problems but not electrical that I'd heard of. (well minor one Ric had)

Don't have the camper conversion.  With that one check the rear 
heating/cooling based on another list member.
