&gt; Subject:    A toast to Bob &amp; Grendel

&gt; All,
&gt;
&gt; Since it is appearent that Bob is going to be departing in a day or so
&gt; (if all goes well), I propose, partly to Bob, and mostly to the rest of
&gt; us mere mortals, that say 10 - 15 minutes before Bob fires up Grendel
&gt; for the trek into warmer (drier?) climes he should send out a message to
&gt; the list saying something to the effect of &quot;10 minutes and counting&quot; and
&gt; give the local time.  We all then get a glass of Beer,Wine,Cola,
&gt; whatever your poison, and when 10 minutes, or whatever interval
&gt; (probably should be closer to 15 or more), elapses we all hold up our
&gt; glasses and say &quot;Good Luck Bob &amp; Grendel&quot; (if someone could translate
&gt; that into german it would be all the better).  With the sudden
&gt; outpouring of good VW karma, a new sense of being should flow into her
&gt; and be more than enough to carry her and Bob through the trials and
&gt; tribulations of the trip home.
&gt;
&gt; Just a thought

...sounds good, i'll be ready and waiting with a bottle of hefeweizen. and
since you asked: the translation of your toast would be &quot;viel gluck Bob and
Grendel&quot;...
