Subject: is my '75 a 2 liter?
Date: Tue, 24 Oct 1995 12:53:34 -0500 (CDT)

As I am still waiting for the rebuilt heads, I did some cleaning of engine
parts (there are so many of those scattered around the basement that I
sometimes wonder whether I will ever be able to put them all back
together?...). As I scraped off the heavy carbon buildup from a piston, I
uncovered the stamped-in piston diameter and --surprise-- it said 93.97
(mm). 

So I take it these are 94mm pistons, the same used in 2.0 liter engines
(the 1.8 liter engine has 93mm pistons). Went back to the old paperwork
(which is complete), but saw no evidence of the pistons having ever been
replaced, even though the last rebuild required a new (rebuilt by VW of
Canada) shortblock. Very odd.

Will check some more serial numbers tonight. One more tidbit: the gap of
the upper ring is 0.070&quot;, i.e., *twice* the tolerance limit for old rings.
Could someone have fitted 94mm pistons with 93mm rings? Mmmh...
