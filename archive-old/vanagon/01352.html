My solution is to have three cars.....one for the wife...and two
for me! Actually, I like to have as many cars as the wallet
and wife permit...or as many as I can get away with.

Cars are sometimes like mistresses...don't treat them right, and
they get downright bitchy. When they are treated right...they
make you feel soooOOOoooo good.

Another observation....some cars have built in sensors, especially
the later computerized types. One sensor is attached to the 
steering wheel, and measures the amount of moisture on your
hand, the stiffness of the grip and your pulse. The other
sensor is on the back of the front seat, It measures your
respiration rate, and quantity, and the amount of sweat
eminating from your back.

When the moisture, pulse, and respiration increases the computer
in your car's engine management system goes into anxiety mode.
The computer then references its own internal records regarding
repairs, oil change, praise, nasty words, etc. It manipulates
this information to arrive at a &quot;treatment&quot; value. If the
treatment (or sometimes called respect value) value is low
and the anxiety measure is high, the  computer goes into
a &quot;F.Y.&quot; mode and shuts everything down. This renders
the car undriveable.

The only solution is to heap money at the car until the computer
goes out of &quot;F.Y.&quot; mode.
