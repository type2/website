     &gt;This is probally a Joel question, but after rains and car washings, 
     &gt;water collects in the trough area around the FI computer and dumps 
     &gt;out when I drive up an incline. I am thinkings there is a drain that 
     &gt;may be clogged by the driver side rear vent, but I can't see one. 
     &gt;Help. Sooner or later water and electronics don't mix.
     
     I've got the same question. On my '84 there is a hole in the bottom of 
     the drain pan below the computer, but it is plugged with a small piece 
     of rubber.  Same on the passenger side.  My neighbors '87 doesn't even 
     have the hole.  Where is water that collects there supposed to go?  I 
     may just remove my rubber plugs.
