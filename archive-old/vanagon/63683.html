Subject: Roaring sound  : 0

Last night after driving approximately 40 miles, a whumpa, whumpa sound began that 
sounded sort of like we were driving over ripply pavement.  It wasn't very loud until we 
began our return drive home (56 miles).  It increased to a sort of roar and worsened on 
acceleration (it got better when I slowed).  I stopped a few times and felt the shaft 
where the wheels were attached (I thought it sounded like it was coming from the front 
of the vehicle and those riding in the rear said it sounded like it was coming from the 
rear) and didn't notice any heat or hot smells.  I was about half-way home so I decided 
to drive slowly (about 40mph) and try to make it without having to have her towed in.  
By the time we had traveled about 15 more miles, the sound had stopped!

What should I have checked tomorrow?  The wheel bearings?  I had the drums rotated and 
it all greased up less than 9 months ago (and since then Jiffy Lube--don't give me a 
hard time about having them do the job--greased it).  I had noticed a funny clicking 
sound coming from my odometer after they replaced the little wire part that fits into 
the wheel shaft that works it and probably should have mentioned it to them as soon as I 
noticed it.  The clicking stopped about the same time the funny sound last night began. 
I'm beginning to wonder if there is any connection between the two.

Also, my muffler is MUCH louder as of a couple of days ago.  Could be a hole in it but 
I don't think there is a connection here to the other problem.

Any help would be very much appreciated whether private e-mail or on the list.

Thanks!
