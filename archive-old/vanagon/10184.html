The brake fluid is leaking out of your clutch (that's why it only drops so
far) and I would hazard a guess that the master cylinder is leaking all over
your carpet!!!
Take a look under the carpet by where the steering column goes under the
floor, my guess is that you will find a puddle/wetness of brake fluid under
there.  The carpet hides these kind of leaks pretty well.
