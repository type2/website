Subject: Vanagon tire ?
Date: Mon, 18 Jul 1994 06:40:37 -0400 (EDT)

What tires are best for '87 Vanagon Westy ?  There are LT's on it now
which the PO had put on and they will need-a-changing soooon.  I was
thinking to go with a good passenger car tire to keep the road noise down.
But, maybe they are not strong enough ?  Are LT's neccessary ?  Any and
all advice welcome.   PS.  I'm still looking for a used but not abused,
original side tent for a Westfalia and an original hubcap.  Oh no not the
hubcap story again ! {:-)

Cheers,

Frank  '87 Westy
