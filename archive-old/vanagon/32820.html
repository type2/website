&quot;but if you are in an accident&quot;

My '72 Fiat 128 came that way from the factory.  I always thought that it 
was to stop the engine if oil pressure was lost due to an engine failure. 
 I like your interpretation better.

Actually I really liked my Fiat 128 and kept it running for about 14 years. 
 I was very impressed by the engineering.  However, the materials were low 
quality.  I remember the year that little springs started to break.  Door 
handle springs, clutch return spring, etc..

When I got introduced to VW, I was impressed with the quality of materials, 
but disappointed in the engineering (compared to my Fiat).  I can 
understand making errors like deflating the spare to wash windows, or 
putting the oil cooler in the wrong place and changing the timing on one 
cylinder to compensate.  But, to perpetuate the error year after year?

In the end, I do prefer the VW quality though.  In the first few years of 
my Fiat's life, I had the fuel pump, the oil pressure sender, and that i  
nterlock relay fail.  Each time, the car stopped dead.

Mike
