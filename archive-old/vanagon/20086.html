To All:

There's really a very simple way to avoid ALL possible road hazards.  That is
to maintain the proper number of car-lengths between yourself and the vehicle
in front of you.  This is the Officially Approved Method in California and is
found in the Approved driver education materials and in the test.  They even
provide a Handy Distance Calculator so you can figure out how far behind the
truck you SHOULD have been when the plywood blew off the rack.  

Let's see now... to deal with ALL road hazards...  ummm... divide by the
square root of pi...   Oh?

Well, maintaining a 3000 mile interval does seem a bit much but if it saves a
few lives...
