Subject: Head Case

After having new heads put on  my 87 Synchro, is there a need to
retorque the heads after a while.  I remember recieving a recall for
this same beloved van that required a retorque.......
Also does anyone make an attractive &amp; functional Brush guard, bumper
enchancer etc.
Also also thanks for the tire advice. Ordered YOKO Y370G  $85 each.
Can't wait to get these slippery Coopers off.
