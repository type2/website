You must keep in mind that some of us own several Volkswagens and that some
of us may even drive the dreaded water cooled ones.

Speaking of inventing things, did you know that Chrylser invented the
mini-van?  I haven't seen a pre '46 model driving around recently, but I'd
sure like someone to point to a web site so I could check one out...
