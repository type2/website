Subject: Nice Heater boxes from Nat Carscadden--THANKS


ron,

i just clean up and looked at the heater boxes you sent me...all i can 
say is WOW! thanks man! they look great...better then the ones i had to 
put on the van...i degreased them and they are just barely barely surface 
rusted...you can barely even tell. i'll get that cleaned up and put them 
on soon! thanks bunches...whoever would thought such nice boxes woulda 
come from the rust belt! (Canada no doubt!)

btw, once they are clean..do i need to paint them or just put them on?

thanks again!
