Subject: WTB: Vanagon Bently book

Hi fellow Bussers! Any of you guys have an old beat up copy of the 
Vanagon Bently book you wanna get rid of? I'm wanting to learn the 
secrets my 89 has and I can't afford $70-$80 for a new copy!  Anyone 
got a copy cheaper?!!??!?!?!?!  I can go up to maybe $25 or so.
Buslady &amp; the pretty shiny Vanagon :D
