I always thought that GVWR is a fully loaded vehicle, passengers and all the
other stuff included?

&gt;Hey,
&gt;All right, one of you gurus explain to me what the gross vehicle weight
&gt;rating (GVWR) found on the sticker in the doorjamb really means.  Is it
&gt;the actual weight of the vehicle?  My '81 Westy has a GVWR of 5093 lbs.
&gt;
&gt;If this is not the actual weight, what is? 
&gt;
&gt;Thanks folks,
