Subject: &lt;syncro/all&gt; setting up R+P gears

Hi folks,

any advice/tips on setting up the ring and pinion in a diff?  Happens to be
the front diff of my Syncro, but should apply to all trans.

the situation...  (have almost) swapped over locking diff components,
including bearing races/adjusters from scrapped Syncro trans into my front
diff. I did not disturb the pinion setting at all in the front, BUT had to
swap ring gears on the diff carrier to maintain a matched set. 

so....   I need to set the side to side position and preload, and check
turning torque, all without the snazzy VW tools shown in the manual.  Some
string and a fishscale to measure the bearing torque is shown in an _old_
bug repair manual I have, any other thoughts?  ie. see the dealer!


Thanks all, Tim
