Subject: Part 2 87 Vanagon FS

-- 

  I got Quite a few requests for different parts.  I also got a couple 
of requests for the Van in one piece.

  I'll keep you up to speed on this matter, and I should be making my 
decision during the next couple of days.

  Antbody else that hasn't let me know what they might want off of this 
van, Let me know.
