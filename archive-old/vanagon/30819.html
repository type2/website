Subject: RE: 1989 Westie - What's a good price?

     Not too bad pricewise Paul, but what about that Syncro you found?
     100K miles could be ok, but read the archives on head leaks.

     Also, while you are there, check the recent archives, there is
     a very nice sounding Syncro Westie, 86 (or was it 87) with 85,000
     miles, known history since new, for $12,500.  In New Mexico,
     but that shouldn't stop anyone chasing the ultimate VW Bus.
     Besides, they'll work out delivery!
