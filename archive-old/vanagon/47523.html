Subject: RE: '87 Cup holders

I believe that the stock cup holders were mounted on the passenger seat
pedestal.  I got look alikes from FLAPS for ~$5 each.  I mounted them on
plastic heater vent in the center of the cab on my '84 westy.  Seemed a lot
more convenient than the seat pedestal position.  Also, there are less
likely to brake there.
