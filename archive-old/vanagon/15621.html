&gt; A Dodge?  Outhandle a Vanagon?  I don't think so.
&gt; 
&gt; I rented one last summer for a 3,000 mile trip.  On smooth roads it 
&gt; handled well.  On dirt roads, rough roads, changing camber and decreasing 
&gt; radius turns it drove like a pig.  You need a damn wide road to make a 
&gt; u-turn, too.  My Vanagon handles as well on smooth pavement and way 
&gt; better on everything else.
