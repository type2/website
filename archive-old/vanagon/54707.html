Subject: Seat covers for 86 Bus Plus

I'm looking for replacement seat covers for rear three-across seat (that
pulls out to form a bed with the foam cushion over the engine cover), as
well as for the single rear-facing seat behind the driver's seat in '86 Bus
Plus.

I've checked Kragens/Grand Auto/Pep Boys chain stores, and they don't list
covers for this model

FYI, the Bus Plus is a Westy w/o appliances, except for a removable 12/110V
Dometic refrigerator behind the passenger seat*, and a pull-up table
between the back seats. I prefer it to the full on conversion, because the
rear seat is as wide as the van, hence, like a couch for that person to
stretch out while playing cards with the person in the rear facing seat
(that seat lifts up for great storage space). Full conversion is only two
across in rear, not enough room for a couch: love-seat? Being Californians,
my ms. and I prefer to cook outside anyway, and have a portable propane
stove with 1 gal. refillable tank, and one of those cool folding picnic
tables to put it on. Also works fine inside if weather is inclement.

*I removed the refrigerator and use it at home for storing beverages: works
much better on 120V than 12V, where it's only good for 8-12 hours running
on auxiliary battery.

Thanks!
