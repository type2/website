&gt;Now that summer's finally arrived, this problem is more noticeable.  Even
with
&gt;the heater contols all the way on cool (blue), warm/hot air comes in.  Is
this
&gt;relatively easy to fix?  Will I need to do major dissassembly of the heater
&gt;unit?  Again, any tips or hints are wlecome.  Thanks.

This probably isn't a problem with heat so much as it is with hot outside
air coming in.  On my '85 (as I've brought up on this list a few times) the
outside air cannot ever be shut off entirely making our vans feeble air
conditioning work that much harder.  I have resolved this by stuffing the
outside air intake with foam packing material for the hot months, removing
it in the cold months when I need the fresh air to heat for winter.

One of these days I'm going to disassemble the dashboard and find out
what's goin on in there, maybe this winter as my fresh air fan is squeaking
and probably not long for this world.
