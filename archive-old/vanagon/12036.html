Subject: 85 Vanagon AC


I bought my 85 Vanagon about a year and a half ago.  The AC has never 
worked and I am interested in getting it up and running again.  Any 
suggestions as to the least stupid strategy to attain this goal?  I 
merely want some guidelines to assist me when the dealer begins to take 
full advantage of my ignorance  ;-).  Many thanks.
