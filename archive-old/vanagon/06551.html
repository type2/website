Subject: camper tops vs the weather

Two more questions for the list dwellers:

- the first is a simple one: anyone know either what kind of plastic the
camper tops are usually made of, or better yet, any good ways to repair a
couple of small cracks in it before they turn into big cracks? I say
usually because this is a non-Westphalia camper conversion, made by VSI in
Calif.) I've thought about metal plates drilled through but I'm wondering
about alternatives.

- the second one is harder. Remember that leak I was talking about awhile
back? (in case you don't I've been catching drips in a pan under my
dashboard lately.)
I thought it was the windshield - but close inspection of the top shows me
that the rear right corner is lifted up about 1/4&quot; - thus allowing water
into and I suspect under the camper top, where it *may* be flowing downward
into some other path to come out under the dash. I'm not sure yet, but I
found that placing a few bricks on the top effectively sealed it up - last
nights rain did not cause any leaks. (Tomorrow's storm will help me test
this hypothesis further!)
So anyway, has anyone have an luck manipulating the metal struts to pull
the top down tighter? Or have any other good ideas for accomplishing the
same task?
(Now I think I know why Westphalia went with the pivoted top instead of the
lifted one!)

btw: the bricks on the top of my van are particularly weird looking. No
comments from the neighbors yet though...

just trying to keep dry,
