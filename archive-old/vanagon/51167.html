Subject: '87 factory radio/cass.

Hello to all--

My 87 vanagon has a factory am/fm/cass radio.  The radio instruction
booklet was not included when I bought the van.  The dealer has given me
the electronic lock-out code and a copy of the page of the instructions
to let me reset it whenever it's disconnected from the battery. 
However, I have no clue as to how to set the stations on the
programmable buttons. If anyone out there has one of these, could you
please enlighten me. 

For the last nearly two years, I've been living with the stations that
the previous owner listened to.  Fortunately, we had similar tastes in
music.  However, two of the local stations have changed formats and I
don't listen to them anymore.

Thanks in advance.
Tonya
