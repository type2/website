If anyone is bringing pet(s), you need to have a current rabies 
vaccination, etc.  I think your local vet can make sure your pup/
kitty/turtle has all the right shots and paperwork.

However, at the Blaine crossing (I-5 between seattle and vancouver)
they are/were pretty mellow.  About 4 years ago, my wife wanted to buy some
duty-free makeup for her mother in Japan.  So we filled up the van with
my mother, two sisters, and my mom's dog.  After going on a spending spree
buying makeup and alcohol, my mother realized (too late) that we had
forgotten the papers for the dog.  At the canadian border, we told 
the guard the usual story (day trip to Stanley Park, not carrying
an gifts for anyone in Canada).  No questions about the dog. Once across 
the border, we made a u-turn, and headed back towards the USA side, 
hoping they weren't going to quiz us about the purchases at the duty-
free store and the undocumented doggie.

At the border, we answered all the questions truthfully:

What did you do in Canada?
   Go sightseeing. (so what if it was only a 25-second trip?)

Are you bringing any gifts for anyone?
   No.  (well we interpreted this to be gifts for people in the US. The
         booze was for my sister's personal use, so it wasn't a gift. The
         makeup was for my mother-in-law in Japan.)

And the guard waved us through.  Didn't even ask if we were all American
citizens (my wife isn't).  I think it's always best to tell the truth. :-)

PS.  My mother did get detained once for about three hours, because the car
she was driving (the squareback killed by the bull) resembled a stolen
vehicle they were looking for.
