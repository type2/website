&gt;Today was fun.  I got to see a 1987 DoubleCab (and discovered the
&gt;same interior appointments my Kombi has) and got to show mine off to
&gt;two people that actually seemed to appreciate it.  I still want to
&gt;find and examine a TriStar...
&gt;
the fellow who imported my 86 double cab was selling a TriStar.He advertised in back of Hot VWs.The company was called Iadho Importers.
