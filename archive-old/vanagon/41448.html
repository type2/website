Subject: Re: deep cycle battery

I just had an Interstate Battery rep walk into my office.  We got to talking 
about this thread and he claims (as any good salesman would) that Interstate 
makes several wheelchair batteries that would fit.  All I could tell him was 
that it would have to be smaller than a series 42 (which means nothing to 
me...I got that from an earlier discussion on this list).  He says if I can 
get him SPECIFIC measurements, he'll let me know what he has that'll fit 
(along with all the techincal stuff if I want it).  

So, does anyone know the measurements of the copartment under the seat?  My 
van is at home, so I'm at a loss...
