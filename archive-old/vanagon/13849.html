Subject: Re: Porsche 914 List?

Do these porsche list holders have a www site or anything like the site that the
vanagon list has?  I don't have a porsche but I would like to scan for equipment
and stuff in common with my bus without subscribing to a list.  The vanagon list 
provides sufficient distraction through the day.

&gt; &gt;Do any of you know whether folks interested in Porsche 914's have a mail 
&gt; &gt;list?  Real Porsche enthusiasts seem to hate the 914, but it does have a lot 
&gt; &gt;in common with the bus, so I thought that I'd ask here.
&gt; 
&gt; Try porschephiles-request_at_tta_dot_com
&gt; 
&gt; Send him a message with who you are, what you drive, etc, and he'll get 
&gt; you set up. 
&gt; 
&gt; Bruce Anderson, Henry Pellow, and they guys from Automobile Atlanta 
&gt; (914 gurus) are on this list.
