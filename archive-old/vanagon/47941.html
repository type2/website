&gt; Has anyone else seen the new Speed Racer spot that's running? Its quite   
&gt; good.  it shows Speed and his chums poking about a smoking Mach-1 which   
&gt; has been sabotaged.   A mysterious man steps forward giving Speed a set   
&gt; of keys to a new GTI.  Speed of course wins the race with all his buddies   
&gt; in the car with him, all the while singing the praises of the GTI.  
&gt; Sorry no bus content...
