Subject:      PNW Camping

The Wetwesties are about to do it again! After a succesful first
camping trip to Eastern OR, where we met splitty, breadloaf and brick
owners from ID, WA and OR we are already thinking about the next one. I
encourage everyone in the PNW area to check the Wetwesties mail list to
see what is going on. Jack Maynard has contacted the Crandalls in
Drain,OR., who are well known for their impressive collection of rare
and mint split window buses. The plan is to have an event in their
property, OCT. 3rd, 4th and 5th. They have several camping spots by the
river and &quot;an apple cider press or two&quot;.
        The camping at Catherine Creek was a lot of fun. Barbara and I
(w/Fafner) met Kim (with her &quot;new&quot; '78 Westie), Tom and Jack Maynard
Friday evening in Corvallis. Camped near Sisters for the night.(The
available solar showers just didn't do it, the sun was barely out when
we left). After travelling most of Saturday through eastern OR, (awesome
landscapes and very small towns) we made it to the campground. We were
pleased to see a lot more people than expected! Even though they had
been told about the event the day before, the loyal Idaho crowd managed
to caravan to Catherine Creek (two splitties and two breadloafs). Jim
Arnott and family were also there, with their '78 Riviera camper. Curt
Long from WA. was also present, with his mint '87 Syncro Westie and a
whole bunch of interesting gadgets (trailer with dirt bike, awning,
laptop with GPS, etc.) Lots of VW talk, live music, good food, frisbee,
pictures (which we hope to make available in the net), etc. Definitely
worth the long drive.
See you in Drain,
Cris.
