Subject: Bone yards near upstate NY? Need sway bar ('82 vanagon).
Date: Wed, 10 Jul 96 18:37:52 EDT


The front sway bar on my '82 Westy is broken. The link next to
the passenger side wheel snapped next to where it bolts on.
I was hoping to find a used sway bar from a parts van. It looks
as I only need to unbolt the tosion bar, and the left and right
side links. 

Where can I get the sway bar? Anybody knows of any bone yards
with vw's near upstate NY (I'm in Rochester)? And how much
should I expect to pay in an unbolt-it-yourself place?

(Sorry, no experience with junkyards here yet, and no luck with
random calling to places listed in the yellowpages. In Sweden
this would have been a non-problem, since vanagons are plentiful there)

Is the sway bar needed on the vanagons? My front wheels seem 
misaligned (wears inside of tires more -&gt; toe out, right?),
but other than that, I haven't noticed any problems. Should I expect
any problems if I just unbolt the broken sway bar and do the
wheel alignment?
