Subject: my answers to the EV questions

Hal,

It sure seems the first half of my gas tank is larger than the second half 8^)
so you're not alone in that observation.  I'm just glad I'm not having the
other guage problems being reported.   I don't know about the dipstick, but
I am hoping that there isn't more than one quart difference between the top
and bottom of the crossed section.  I just try to keep mine topped off.

Wax has been leaking out of my door since last summer but the reduced weight
hasn't seemed to affect mileage, and I haven't had the problem of water
collecting in the hood.

BTW, any of you EVers out there contemplating how to find out if you have
the piston slap problem - before the warranty runs out?  I think mine sounds
OK, and I'm afraid the dealer would ruin my engine if they started fooling
around with it.  Scary....
