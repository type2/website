&gt; Well, I just replaced the shift couple on my '65 deluxe.  I had to sissor-
&gt; jack up the transmission inorder to line up the new coupler. Humm....
&gt; I didn't think it should have to move so much for alignment.  I lowered the
&gt; jack and shifting is really stiff.  The shift rod is bottoming out on the 
&gt; guide.  somethings not right.  I think I have a broken front transmission
&gt; mount.  Since I don't have a Bentley (but I'm right behind Bentley College)
&gt; could someone help me out?  What does the front trans mount look like?
&gt; Mines got a rubber mat between two steel plates.  The plate next to the 
&gt; transmission is not fixed to the rubber.  I think it should be.  When I 
&gt; lower the trans. the plate slides down the rubber mat.  I think my 
&gt; transmission is merely leaning against the rest of the mount because it
&gt; can't fall lower.  It also explains the weird oscillations I get in low
&gt; gears as maybe the trans/engine is bouncing up and down and pulling on
&gt; the accellerator cable.  I've lived with this and learned to drive her 
&gt; w/o causing this to happen.  Is my front mount busted?  I don't see any
&gt; other means of keeping the trans elevated/oriented properly.
&gt; 
Funny you should mention this, as I plan to replace mine this evening.
Iordered a new mount from The Bus Stop (RMMW), for like $6.00. It's a
good idea while you're under there to replace the rear trans mounts,
too, since it will be fairly easy at that point. Mine has been getting
progressively worse; you can hear and feel it clunk when you release the
clutch, and shifting is getting worse. If UPS gets the stuff here today,
and all goes well tonight, I will let you know the results.
