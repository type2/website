Subject: Adjusting Valves on '77

Greetings Volks,

My '77 does not have hydraulic lifters (I think they started in '78) so it's
time to adjust the valves. I have taken it to my mech. in the past but decided
to become self reliant and try it myself. 

The Bently book is self-explanatory but does not mention putting the gaskets
back on. Do I need to but a sealant on the gasket when installing? Are there
any other tricks to remember or be careful of??

TIA for any votes of confidence/advice.

P.S. Why isn't there an &quot;e&quot; in vanagon instead of an &quot;o&quot;...as in Volkswagen?
