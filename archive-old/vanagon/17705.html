Subject: 71 bus question
Date: Wed, 17 May 1995 10:10:29 -0400 (EDT)

Brother Muldoon can you spare some advice,
With every new nook and cranny I look in my recently purchased 71 bus, 
I'm finding major problems (brake system, suspension) :( .  The engine 
seems very good (now that I've put 009 distrib. and new carb) and is 
purring.  I must now consider perhaps keeping the engine and finding a 
new body for it.  What other years of bus will this engine fit into 
without major modification??  TIA!
