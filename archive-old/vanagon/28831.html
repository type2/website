&gt;I have never seen the underside of a 65 splittie and would be
&gt;most gratefull to anyone who can advise.

Since the bus is &quot;nose in&quot; and the rear bumper is
questionable, I would suggest you do not *hook* the chain to
the bus, but that you wrap the chain around the transmission
support and then hook the chain back on itself.  You may
also want to put a piece of carpet or throw rug on top of
the chain to protect anything on the bus the chain contacts
when you pull it tight.

I have three '67 buses, have had to pull them with a chain
from time to time and always use the tranny support for the
back with no damage.  Anything else you might &quot;hook&quot; to may
be too rusty to take the stress of pulling the bus out of
there.
