Subject: Another replacement tire for EVers?

Greetings, all

'Finally got to see the '97 Winnie/EV in the sheetmetal,
and the part that intrigued me the most were its shoes(!)
It's got Goodyear Cargo tires in a 205/65/15 size, which
happens to be the same size as the OEM shoes on my EV now;
have we hacked the merits of this tire to death yet?...
Has anyone had any experience w/ them?  I imagine they must
meet the basic qualification for VW &quot;truck&quot; use, i.e. the
sidewalls are reinforced, blah, blah, blah...
