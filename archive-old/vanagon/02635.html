Well, I think that &quot;seeking professional help&quot; may be a little extreme.  :)
The determining factors to me were price, and legality.  Considering it
would cost me $35 to rebuild my dual Solexes, versus paying at least ten 
times that much for new carbs (and possibly more for manifolds), and then
not being able to pass a smog check, it seemed ludicrous to even consider
*not* rebuilding the stockers.  Sure, I might be able to eek out a few
more horses with an aftermarket setup, but I have already accepted the
fact that my bus will never be a hotrod.  A few extra horses are not
worth all the extra trouble and expense.  Besides, my mileage would
probably suffer, and who knows how the extra power would affect engine
life?  I luv my Solexes... 21 mpg highway... fly through smog...  NYAH!
