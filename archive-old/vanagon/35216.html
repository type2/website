Subject: RE: Wanted:  Subaru 2.2 sources


&gt;P.S. - I can make it down the coast to pick up an engine if someone
&gt;there is able to do the install while I'm there.  Any list members up
&gt;for a project?  Steve M?  Hmmm...?  Just *pretend* it's a V6 :)

It's not my engine-- I'm not the one who has to do the pretending.  :^)

Keep in mind that it's not just an &quot;install&quot;, even using the Kennedy
kit. Many things are not supplied: Radiator, radiator mounts, hoses,
rear engine mount (for '68 and newer), heater if any, temperature
gauge if any (I recommend this), radiator fan, switches and wires to
hook it all up, and a partridge in a pear tree.

The PO who did the conversion on the V6anagon, did some fabricating
of many items, which you'll probably have to do too. I've heard that
Kennedy is now starting to offer some of these parts-- call them to
check your particular application.

A note on the 135HP of the Subaru, vs. the advertised 112 of the V6anagon:
The smaller the displacement of the engine, the faster it has to turn to
produce horsepower, generally speaking. The V6anagon has wonderful
low-end torque, but isn't really used to turning 4000 rpm in 4th gear
to do 75 mph. Some smaller engines may be different-- designed to
turn fast to produce power. Thses could be an excellent match for
the VW bus, since the VW tranny lets the engine turn fast.
