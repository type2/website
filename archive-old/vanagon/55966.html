Subject: '91 Syncro suddenly won't start

Oooops, was so whacked out by my near-perfect new '91 Syncro Westy not
starting, that I spaced out saying what vehicle it is.  So here's a repost
with more details:

'91 Syncro, 2.1 engine, 49k miles, two month old battery, outside
temperature in the forties with strong wind, driving at an elevation of
about 6,000+', wet snow on the road.  

After driving a couple of hundred miles today, the final stretch of about 80
miles after having stopped for ten minutes, I turned off the engine, and a
few minutes later it wouldn't start.  There was spark, it turned over,
didn't sputter, just wouldn't start.  After about 30 minutes it started up
again and ran fine.  What's up?

I'm on the road away from home (Colorado) and my trusty super-hero mechanic,
now in Northern AZ and hopefully headed for Tucson tomorrow AM, then after a
few days, on to Mexico.  Had the van thoroughly checked out before leaving
home and was told everything was in excellent mechanical condition.  I'm a
mechanical nincompoop and don't want car problems down there!  What should I
have checked out?  Anyone know where between Holbrook and Tucson there's a
reliable and good mechanic? (Assuming I can run tomorrow to get it to
someone.......)
