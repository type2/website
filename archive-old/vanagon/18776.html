I was just wondering, I figure most of these being seen were
imported in the late '80's by a company in the midwest, that
used to advertise in VW Trends and Hot VW's.  Every month there
was an add back in the classifieds with a picture of a crew cab
syncro Vanagon, I think they were coming from Australia or somewhere
where they were quite common, the add used to say they were available
with ridiculous options like leather interiors and full power
crap and I think the price then was about $25k when a normal syncro
in '87 or so was probably going at what $18k or so?  Anyway, does
anybody remember these adds and know anything about the company?
I'm wondering how many came in and when it becam too hard to import
them to make it worth while, I think the black market on euro
BMW 7's and the like closed down in about 87 or so as it had become
nearly impossible to bring non US market cars in.  Is it still
possible to import these things?  Were they sold new in Canada and
would it be possible to procure them there and bring em in, inquireing
minds want to know.
