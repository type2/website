Subject: '75 Westy (FS)

There is a '75 Westy for sale here for $400.  I haven't looked at it, but 
the owner said that he had the parts to rebuild the motor, that the 
canvas is good, and the components are there.  Some rust in the passenger 
floor and in front of the rear wheel on one side.  I was hoping to look 
at it at noon today, but the battery in my wifes car exploded (!?) so I 
had to rescue her instead.  I'll try to look at it tomorrow and keep 
y'all posted.
