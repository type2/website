Subject:  Oil Cooler seal leaks in extreme cold

Extreme cold weather can harden and split the seal between the engine
block and the oil cooler thus creating an oil leak:
*  An improved cold-restistant seal was installed in production as of
   02/87.
*  The new seal can be identified by its silver-grey appearance and is
   available through your parts department, Part No. N 901 814.02.
