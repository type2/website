&lt;&lt; This may be the dumbest question yet(if it is I should win a new vr6 or
 at least one of those 5th seats with the strong box underneath), but
 what purpose are the white knobs just above and behind the driver and
 passenger seats for in my 84 westy? They are not needed to hang the
 curtains and seem to have little to do with the fuel infection system.

YES!!! THAT IS THE DUMBEST QUESTION EVER ASKED ON THE VANAGON LIST!!!!

LOL.....   :&lt;)

just kidding. 

they're &quot;coathooks&quot;.
funny thing is, that they are the ONLY part that is the same ON ALL
buses/vans from '64 to '91...
I'm serious...

I took a coat hook out of my '87 vanagon and matched it up with the coathook
in my '67 deluxe microbus, and it's THE SAME THING!!!

kool, huh??
