Subject: Vanagon

Hello!  My name is Matthew Schiebout. The reason i am writing you is
concerning my pending purchase of a 1987 Vanagon GL Syncro.  Here is a low
down on the vehicle low miles, manual trans, roll up windows, manual locks,
alloy rims, always stored inside, never used off-road, rear locking diff
(it works i tested it).

My questions are

1) what is a good deal as far as price goes

2) what problems should i look out for

3) Another question is if a second locking diff for the front was available,
even if it is more recent models, how much it would cost for used parts (if
available) and the cost of installation.  

Thanks!
Matthew Schiebout
