Subject: Re: Why me?


~~I know where there is a 68 bug with a AE motor from 1971 in it.  I was
!!considering buying it and scrapping the body, it is in very bad shape.  I
_at__at_did a compression check on the motor, all were 115-120 PSI.  The only
##problem is the motor has no crossmember holes.  I know I heard some people
$$talking about some adapter or some such thing, has anyone ever really used
%%one of these things for a long period of time?

My '70 originally (when I saw it) had a &quot;B&quot; series motor with a really 
1/2-assed welding job on the crossmember to hold it in place.  It did 
work, but I feared NOT FOR LONG.  So the &quot;new&quot; '72KG motor went in, 
already had the mounting holes.  

While the bug motor is out, how about having the FLARS tap the mounting 
holes?

GOOD LUCK!!!  A dead bus is a sad thing. :-(
