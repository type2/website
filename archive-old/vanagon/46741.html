Subject: syncro mystery noise

Fellow syn-cronies,
                    The noise I'm referring to is a regular fairly loud
clicking that sounds like a stone caught in the right front tire tread
(there are none). It only becomes audible at 50mph or above driving straight
or turning. I have begun a diagnosis by checking for obvious play, loose
stuff etc. in the driveline up front, I pumped some cv grease in the right
front outboard cv. Braking doesn't affect the sound except for slowing it
down. So far no good! Any clues from  learned listmembers would greatly
appreciated. TIA.
