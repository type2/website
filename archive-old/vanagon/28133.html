Subject: EV tires, Rims?

Hey Now,

RIMS
I'm looking to get an extra set of rims to put my winter tires on on my EV.
Do the same rims that fit on older VW's also fit on the EV?
TIRES
 There is a manufacturer 'Haakepelitta&quot; that makes snow tires which,sold by
Greer Enterprises (414)747-0996. I saw them at my buddys house and they look
rugged.  Anyone hear of them before? Any experiences?
