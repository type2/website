Subject: Re: Anyone know how to tune a judson supercharger?

&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm not sure if your judson will work on the 1500cc engine...or
&gt;&gt;&gt;at least work to its full potential. From what I recall the
&gt;&gt;&gt;Judsons were set up for the 1200cc 36 and 40hp engines. Those
&gt;&gt;&gt;uses small manifolds as well as the 28 PICT carbs.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;1500 cc engines used a larger manifold as well as a larger 30pict
&gt;&gt;&gt;carb. If you use the 28PICT carb on your 1500 cc engine, then you
&gt;&gt;&gt;are in effect chocking off the air to your engine, and probably
&gt;&gt;&gt;won't get the full effect of the supercharger.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Ric

Ya' I do believe they were for the 36 and 40 hp engines, but
I do have a 30PICT on the supercharger, and the pully I had modified
is a full size pully (same size as the one that drives the generator)
so I am running a higher ratio than the Judson origional pully,
and therfore it should produce more boost than with the origional
pully (If the little information I have found is correct, with the
smaller pully it produced 6 psi of boost).  As far as what effects I 
will gain with this set up, well, I won't know untill I get the
engine running as to weither this set up is advantagous or not.
The price on the supercharger was right, and I always like having
something different (hell, why else would I want to drive a volkswagen
and suffer all of the indignity my friends subject me to!!!).

&gt;From what I have read on superchargers in general, you jet the carb and
set the idle with the drive pully disconected, then reset the idle
with the pully on, but I'm not 100% sure this is corect for this
paticular supercharger.  Any help on that matter??
