Subject: Re: Hello, and thanks in advance!

This was also my thought!

BTW, I want to say a public &quot;Thank you&quot; to all of the replies I have gotten
from my post.  I have checked the undercarriage and it is pretty prestine
(well, some gunk but no rust).

All of the replies I got very not only nice but very favorable which made
them doubly nice.  There seems to be a much nicer 'tone' if you will on
this list than on some other non-VW lists I am on.

Thank you and hopefully, someday, I will be able to repay the hospitality.
