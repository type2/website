&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't think this would work so well as I'd be constantly opening 
the
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; fridge to get another beer! ;)
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;

&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Hopefully not while driving.  Although if you can manage that
&gt;reach-around, I'd
&gt;&gt; &gt; like to see a picture.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; You really gotta want that beer...  ;p
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Steven
&gt;&gt;
&gt;My trick is to get the beer to want you. Then it comes right on out of
&gt;the cooler and into your hand. No strained muscles attempting VW
&gt;gymnastics or anything...

I've often tried that on my 13mm combo wrench while under the V6anagon
working on the throttle linkage or whatever.

Hasn't worked yet.   :(
