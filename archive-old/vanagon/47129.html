Subject: Re: '83 H2O head gasket advice needed (long)

&gt;blue colored chemical. Well, they say there is combustion gas in the 
&gt;coolant and say this is also why the fan isn't coming on, something 
&gt;about the sensor.

sometimes the internal leak can be fixed with retorquing of the heads, 
sometimes.  Once you've done that try the bleeding again.  Are you sure the 
bleeding is really working well!! Replacing the head gaskets and the 
cylinder end gaskets (kit is $190 for both sides) may be needed.  Job takes 
a FULL weekend. Not technically hard, lots of plumbing to get out of the way 
etc.  Check the archives, Dan Houg, I and Herb Harminson have all posted 
procedures for the job.  Only 'special' tool needed is a torque wrench. Try 
a treatment (or 2) of BarsLeak if this doesn't clear up with retorquing, you 
have nothing to loose!  Tim Smith


&gt;
&gt;So, I desperately need advice on verifying this. Did I forget anything? 
&gt;Should I recheck? A second opinion? A local vw specialist (not a 
&gt;dealer) said it would run about $1000 :( I've never done any kind of 
&gt;repair to this scale but I'm not afraid to learn and try. Should I be? 
&gt;I've printed all the applicable articles from the archive, got my 
&gt;Bentley. Anything else? Any advice or opinions would be greatly 
&gt;appreciated!
