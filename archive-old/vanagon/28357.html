You mean not everyone igorned that thread like me?  8-)  (sarc. intended)
&gt; 
&gt; Amen!
&gt; 
&gt; So, can anyone tell me when European busses ceased to have 
&gt; semaphores.  I saw a green kombi with the same taillights as my '57, 
&gt; but not turn signals, and I couldn't see any semaphores by the doors.
&gt; 
&gt; Odd!

I'll guess that they stopped the same year as the bugs--1960
