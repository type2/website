 NOTICE ! DWEEB ALERT!
  
 For those of you unfortunate enough to have seen the new June issue of
 VW Trends, their vintage oriented issue, a novel concept, and brought
 out just a month ahead of Hot VWs July issue - they certainly are trend
 setters all right.
 
 Well it seems there must be another VW-illiterate at the helm of Trends,
 either that or sabotage due to the fact they are the major sponsor of
 the other event in the area. Either way, the facts are that VW trends
 decided on their own two years ago that they did not want to be a
 sponsor of the VW Classic, and so HVWs stepped in as a major sponsor,
 prior to that both magazines were handled absolutely equal. In the
 coverage of the Classic that year, the author made some unnecessary
 negative comments, and last year I decided not to even advertise the
 Classic in Trends. Trends, in turn, decided not to cover the event,
 understandable maybe, but one of their staff had to attend anyway and
 walk around all day and tell people that Trends wasn't covering the
 event, which is bull shit. By the way, Trends also neglected to cover
 the Bug-O-Rama held in September until now - 8 months later. The
 Bug-o-Rama just happens to be another HVWs sponsored event . . . . and
 the largest, longest running, probably most prestigious fricking VW drag
 racing event there is, at least on the West Coast. Makes you go mmmmmmm,
 don't it?
 
 This year, unbelievable as it may seem, I decided not to advertise in
 Trends again. The Classic got bigger last year with out them anyway, so
 guess what? The event section of their latest issue has the Classic down
 for the Monday after the Fourth of July. I don't know why I didn't think
 of that date before . . . . A Monday show.  Gee, maybe I could be a
 trendsetter too.
 
 Actually the correct date for the VW Classic is still JUNE 8th, a
 Sunday, the second one in June, as it always has been during the last
 half a dozen or so Trends editors. Evidently the folks over there have a
 bone to pick, or they're just dweebs. I appologise for their inconvience
 and please don't change your air line reservations.
 
 I hope to see you all at the Classic . . . ON SUNDAY JUNE 8TH
 
 RICH KIMBALL
 
 PS, if you think you know anyone else who may have been unfortunate
 enough to se a copy of that fish wrap, please feel free to spam this
 notice along. &gt;&gt;
