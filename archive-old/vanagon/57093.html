	Reason for Selling the van:  I have to many toys and not enough time to
play with them.  The van served me very well, but no I longer have the
time to use it as it should be used.  I would like to sell it and let
someone self enjoy the van.  If not it will sit in the drive way and
remind me of the outings I am missing.
