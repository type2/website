Subject:  Re: VW 3 : Locksmith 1

Once I was locked out of my '73 bus/camper in the rain.  I was out late
and didn't want to face the possible truth that my keys were actually
inside the bus and that I was diligent in locking every single door.  I
was planning on sleeping in the bus that night since it was in my mother's
driveway and I decided that it would be more comfortable than the couch.
After many unsuccessful attempts to get the vent wing open with a bent
coat hanger I convinced my skinny friend John to try the final solution.
I got him to crawl up through the engine compartment and open the top
hatch.  Then he squeezed into the &quot;bed&quot; area and went to the front to open
the door for me.  Lucky for me I didn't have an engine in the bus!
