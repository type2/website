I did this last year with a 79 westy, so if you have any questions, pass 
them along.  By the way, the first step is to call VW in the US and ask 
for a certificate of conformity for the particular vehicle you'd like to 
import.  You'll need the VIN.

&gt; 
&gt; I need some help and I can't seem to find the right place to get it so
&gt; I'm asking for your help please. I am investigating the importing of a
&gt; Westfalia van from Alberta, Canada to Montana, USA. Will vans sold in
&gt; Canada from 1980 to 1990 meet US EPA and DOT standards for US
&gt; importation? Maybe you might know or direct me to someone who might.
&gt; Thank you in advance for any help you may be able to provide.
