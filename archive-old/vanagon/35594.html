Subject: Re:Which tires? 185 or 205

&gt;&gt; I was thinking about making the switch to 205's, looking for smoother 
ride,
&gt;&gt;more traction in mud &amp; snow.  And frankly, the westy looks like it's 
standing
&gt;&gt;on birdlegs on them skinny tires.
&gt;
&gt;I don't think wider tires will give more traction on snow. On the
&gt;contrary: wider tires offer more surface for the snow to lift the vehicle
&gt;up from solid ground. Same as aquaplaning.
&gt;
&gt;Ideally, I'd like a set of wide wheels for the summer, but keep the stock
&gt;wheels w/ 185ers for the winter.

 Wilma likes her 185 with stock rims, as well. These are (not so cheap) 
Sears RoadHandlers M+S by Michelin. Very nice if I may add.
