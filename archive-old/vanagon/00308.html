Subject: 72 &amp; 73 Camper questions

 Hi all. I've got a whole slew of camper-related questions. Answers to _any_
of them would be much appreciated.
 1. We have a 73' poptop with the 1700. When we first got it, the Solex carbs
seemed to be hosed, and I replaced them with a Weber from JC Whitney. This
carb sits atop a manifold that runs to the ports on each side. I works well,
but required that I remove quite a bit of the emissions (fresh air-pump lines
,etc.). I needed to plug the ports where thery entered the engine. Aside from
getting it through inspection (I'm in MA, so it's not _so_ bad), will this
affect the way my engine runs at all? Also, the linkage where the gas pedal
cable attaches is in a different place. Had anyone had any experience moving
the tube through which this runs to the back of the van? As silly as it
seems, nowhere in the documentation that came with this carb (or on the box) 
did it identify what model Weber I have ... Does it sound like a progressive?
 The compression on the right (passenger's) side of the engine is great, but
the two cylinders on the driver's side are terrible. It's also very noisy
over there when running, and I can hear air hissing. What I'm hoping is that
the head has come loose ... After removing the rocker arms, I've discovered
four bolts that seem to hold the head on. Are there another four under the
sheetmetal that is directly about the head? Should I removeit and tighted them as well?
 2. I also just picked up a '72 bus with the camper interior. It was too cheap
to pass up ($200), and parts are hard to come to here in Mass. The compression
on this one is great, but I am yet to get it started. Is tehre a better way to
test for spark at the plugs than by holding them to the block &amp; turning the
engine over (as per Muir manual)? This never really works for me very well -
even on vehicles that run. This vehicle has been converted to electronic
ignition, and I'm thinking about undoing that ...If the carbs were shot, would
I at least be able to get it to catch using starting fluid?

 Sorry to be so long winded ... any help is much appreciated.
