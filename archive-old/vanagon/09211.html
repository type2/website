&gt; &gt; Somone's clogging up the bandwidth with irrelevant trivata?

&gt; I guess it's my birthday, (and my list) &lt;big grin&gt;.

Maybe if you would say &quot;It's my birthday and I'm having an
engine pulling party this weekend and you're all invited,
bring your coveralls and your tools and no beer until we
get the darn thing back in.....&quot; it would be closer to on-topic.
