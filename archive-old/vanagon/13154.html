Subject: Re: peeling wallpaper


Hey (to anyone facing a re-papering job)-

	I am finishing up the interior of my 78 Westfalia, and recently had
to deal with the dangling wallpaper syndrome.  My answer, after looking
at both standard wallpaper and contact paper was uhh... NOT.
	I opted for a removal of the papered panels, pulling off of the old
paper, and a couple coats of Navajo White interior semi-gloss latex paint.
This will fare well against extremes of wet and warmth, I believe...

			Jeff.
