Subject:       Re: Mo' buses in da movies

&gt; Was watching the 'boob-toob' last night when an ad for the
&gt; new Winona Ryder movie came on.  Her boyfriend was driving
&gt; a 66 or 67 Microbus.
&gt; 
&gt; BONUS ROUND:
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone guess how I was able to place the year of the 
&gt; bus in the 2 seconds it was on screen?

Umm.  There were winshield squirters on it!  Hmm.  Probably too small 
to tell on TV.
