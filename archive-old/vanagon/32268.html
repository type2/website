Some lightly misinformed vanagoneer mentioned.

With Jap bikes developing one hp per cubic centimeter, pulling 200 hp out of
a 2000cc engine falls into the 'So what?' catagory.  But run the engine for a
hundred thousand miles and it may be an article worth reading.

Dyno testing is lots of fun but those suckers don't handle very well in
traffic :-)

Lemme see a 50bhp Suzuki 50cc triple.  Not quite but close.  Look up the
50cc triple in your archives.  Awesome bit of watercooled two-stroke 
engineering by the finest in the business at the time.  banned from GP 
racing as too powerful.

maybe bobo means 100bhp/litre. 

I think a 23hp weedwhacker would do serious work on gophers.  Like the
famous hotsaw competitions at loggers rodeos the mere thought of a 23hp
castor oil lubricated expansion chambered 23cc weed whacker boggles the mind.

As a previous owner of the meanest in the jungle (Kawi 750cc Triple) a 
750HP bike would be unmanageable except at the 1320 shootouts and bonneville 
but the rush...
