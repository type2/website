&gt;Can anyone comment on the Carlisle Imports show and swapmeet coming up next
&gt;weekend?  Size of swap meet, type of cars to be seen, relative incidence
&gt;(both in show and swap) of chrome plated plastic versus cheap greasy steel.
&gt;Anything to help me determine whether a 2-3 hour drive each way would be
&gt;worthwhile.  Thanks!
&gt;B.

This is usually a great show. I will be there along with members of Limbo.
 They have great Bathroom shower facilites on the the gronds and you can camp
there overnight.  In fact I usually stay parked right on the show field
Saturday night.  Ther are allways a number of VW vendors such as East Coast
Joe's and 4ever4 there.  Ther are also plenty of food vendors to feed your
family.  This is one of our favorites.

Dennis.
