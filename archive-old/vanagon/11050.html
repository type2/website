&gt; 
&gt; On my 86 Synchro, I've replaced the seal around the drive shaft that
&gt; comes out of the transmission to the front differential.
&gt; 
&gt; I still have a leak from this seal. On my garage floor, I get about a
&gt; quarter sized drop once a week.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone have any ideas why this seal continues to leak?

  Because it hates you, of course. More seriously, if dirt got into the seal/
  shaft interface it may have worn a groove in the shaft which will contribute
  to the problem. Another thing to check is the breather vent for the trans-
  axle - If this has become clogged with grunge or mud [been out 4-wheeling?]
  the pressure increase inside the gearbox when it heats up may drive some
  oil past the seal. 

  Hope this helps,

  Dave
