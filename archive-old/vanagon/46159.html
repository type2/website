Subject: A serious plea for help.

You guys have to help me, you must restore my faith.  I have three
Volkswagens (2 busses and a Squareback) and I spend almost every
non-salaried minute of my pitiful life working on them or studying about
what I'm going to try next.  None of them will start, I'm starting to get
sick of it.  Why must I drive a front engined, front wheel drive, water
cooled Audi to work every day?  Someone out there has to remind me why I
am doing this.  Has anyone out there been on the brink of throwing in the
towel and had a revelation at the last moment?  My friends think I'm nuts
over the Volkswagens and I'm starting to see their side.  Help me before I
lose it.
-Erik.
