&gt; Hi folks,
&gt; 
&gt; I picked up a Petersen's VW magazine dated 1973 at a flea market last
&gt; weekend.  It has many neat black and white pictures of vw parts in
&gt; junkyards, speed parts, and various buses and bugs.  In the speed section I
&gt; saw I photo of magnesium rockers. 

Buy some and bring them to a CCC meet...

Bradley Prunehead will look after 'em.

(But you're right they won't last long.)


Cheers,
