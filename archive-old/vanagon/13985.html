Not that we have the loss of power problem; but I am wondering if the pot
should be cleaned periodically with alcohol or something along those
lines? Should the metal contacts be cleaned periodically ala the trackball
in a laptop?
PS We did have the loss of power problem and I traced it to a plugged
cat... which I replaced. DC
