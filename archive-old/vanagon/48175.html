Subject: Mailing list for Sea to Mountains Trip et al

hey now,

i've gotten many replies to the idea of this trip. i'm open to anything
really. as long as someone has CO2 system for my keg of beer! :-)

okay, i've decided to start up a list of folks who might be interested in
discussing and planning this trip. if you want to be on it, please send me
an email with &quot;VW TREK LIST&quot; in the subject line.

i'll then put everyone on a mailing list and keep ya up to date and all that
jazz. of course i'll post to the lists as well. and if someone wants to set
up a homepage...well, that would be groovy.

i'm still at work now...ah, 2nd shift sucks. Rumba sits in the parking lot,
waiting to go and play with all the other buses at the NC VW campout
tommorrow. maybe i can get them to mount her gauges to the dash, put the
spare tire on front, wash her windows...etc. heeheheheh muahhahahahahah

take care,

jonathan '74 Retrowestie (Rumba and The Flowers of Power)
