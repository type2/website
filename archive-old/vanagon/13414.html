Subject: Rusty Needs Whatnot

Please Help! Groveling for Mercy, Bowling for Dollars (Facing East)/Wolfsburg

My source for interior parts to go into my '67 Westy just called and
informed me that the What-Not cabinet that he was going to nab for me got
nabbed by someone else. Maybe it's the will of Allah ;) but I need a
What-Not cabinet!!!!  What is a man without a What-Not cabinet? I have all
of the parts for my resto from hell except the flippen cabinet (and a
bodyman with a work ethic). I'll flame the bodyman some other day.

Possibly Allah is in Ohio?
