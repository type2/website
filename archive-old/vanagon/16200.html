Subject: Re: Westy tent /Vanagon tent

Hi, it MAY be worth it, mildew turns canvas to powder, so I wouldn't pay 
anything until I'd put it up once and really checked it over. The corner 
pieces of the frame crack through and bend, so check them out. They can 
easily be brazed (cheaply), BTDT. The vinyl seal for the rain is essential, 
stabilizes things really well really makes the tent into an add-on room, not 
just a tent 'real close by'. You may have some tailor work to do, but mildew 
is structural rot to a tent, so beware.

And for vanagon owners..... there is a German made Vanagon tent available, 
I'm trying to deal on one now. Owner bought in Germany in 1984, same tunnel 
connection to rain gutters, but... it's bigger, has no floor (this is 
typical of Euro tents) a 'room' with floor is suspended inside. Front 
completely rolls up to make dining/shade area or when down has door and 
window. Poles are shock corded spring together type. The owner wants me to 
buy the '83 H2O Westy also.

If this deal goes through OK I will sell my breadloaf tent, it is in very 
good condition, I swear it. No rips/holes/leaks top or bottom, all 
zips/poles OK.
