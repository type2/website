Subject:      oil leak source

Hi all,

Last month I discovered an oil leak asked the list for potential causes
(so I wouldn't get shocked totally when I brought it in).  Well, I
finally got the oil changed and asked the dealer to find where the leak
was coming from.  They did, and it's an oil pressure switch (whew!).
Great news, they said part $18, labor $45 (something I think I'm willing
to pay cause I'm sure that it's probably a messy job--plus oil is too
important to mess up on it).

Bad news, they said there are 3 different switches and they don't stock
any of them.  They won't know which switch I need until they pull mine
out, at which time, they can overnight me one in and leave me stranded
without my van for a night.  Does this sound reasonable?  It sounded to
me like they didn't have a repair manual.  Surely, there's a diagram
somewhere that says what is where.

I really don't want to be without my van for a night.  It'd also be real
inconvenient as the dealer is an hour from my house.  How hard are these
buggers to replace?  Any dangers in a novice doing it?  (i.e. will I do
irrepairable harm to the engine?)

Thanks all!
