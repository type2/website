Ron,

The '85 Westy has rails so a seat slides in and then bolts down.  Takes
about 10 minutes.  I have a two person seat and another single seat.  The
wide seat blocks opening the refrigerator door.

The childs bed is two rails with a canvas bed like a camp cot.  It reaches
from the drivers door to the passengers door and slides into brackets
screwed to the door frames.  It has cloth sides which pull up and fasten 
to the top of the doors so the kid can't roll out.  This was original
optional equiopment.

&gt; &gt;This bus has an extra seat so can seat 6, plus an additional extra single

&gt; 
&gt; I'm confused.  Do you mean you took a middle seat out of a 7 pass van, and
&gt; bolted it to the floor?  So I guess it fits in there, but you just can't open
&gt; the fridge up?
&gt; 
&gt; Regarding the single seat - is that one of those removeable jumpseats that fits
&gt; behind the front pass. seat out of like a wolfsburg van or something? Wouldn't
&gt; it be a grey velour?
&gt; 
&gt; the childs bed across the front seats - did you add this out of a '70's westy??
&gt; I've never heard of a Vanagon westy w/ a childs cot.
&gt; 
&gt; interesting custom options.
&gt; good ideas though!

Has anyone else ever seen a childs cot for a Vanagon Westy? 
I didn't know they existed.
