Hey all --

Just received this from by web site -- any body have some help for him?

&gt;
&gt;I just returned from alaska and did a little travel on the marine highway. 
&gt;My impression is the the use of a small van like the volkswagen van you are
&gt;traveling in would be a useful machine for a return trip.  I could be used
&gt;very effectively on the boats and carry the camping equipment and other
&gt;travel accessories as well as provide a place to rest for the evening.  The
&gt;marine highway includes most of the allutian (sp) chain of islands and not
&gt;very accessable mainland.  I would like an older van with enough horse
&gt;power for the trip.  Do you have any recommendations for me.  
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
