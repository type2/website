Subject: Re: abbreviations

Can I ask that this thread be extended a bit?  I would love a glossary of
some of the terms used here.  For instance, I assume a Devon is a
Westfalia in England, but until Thom said &quot;no, no&quot; I always assumed that
&quot;barn doors&quot; were the double side doors that opened out from the center on
busses thru '67.  OK, I'll play ignorant (it's a natural talent for me),
can we write a VW glossary?  If not this Friday, then next?
