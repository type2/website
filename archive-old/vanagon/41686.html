Subject: 87 syncro: fully synthetic
Date: Thu, 9 May 1996 07:53:40 -0700

This past weekend I replaced the gear oil in my syncro's final front drive 
with Redline MTL synthetic. The vanagon lubrication is now fully synthetic 
with Redline MTL in the tranny and front drive and Mobil 1 in the engine. 
I'll keep the list posted with results (hopefully there won't be anything 
to post and the van will run forever!).

I've had Redline MTL in the tranny for 6000 miles now with no detectable 
seal leakage or degradation in performance.
