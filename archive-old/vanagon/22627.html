Subject: tire dilemma
Date: Sun, 13 Aug 95 9:09:19 EDT

About a week we had a blowout on one of our rear tires while driving down
the highway. Unfortunately the tire is beyond repair. On the other hand
neither of the rear tires owe us anything. We picked them up at A and A
Auto Import an Wreckers outside of Son Jose for 45 a pair and they lasted
for 15000 miles. The van is an 82 Westfalia

Here is the dilemma: The rears are both Michelin X's 185R14 C rated tire (a
precursor to the XZX reinforced tire I guess). The fronts are a no name
&quot;Aspen&quot; 195R14 non reinforced tire. The fronts have some good tread left
while the rears have less tread left but have the advantage of being a)
the size the manual calls for and b) reinforced. I have narrowed my tire
choices down to either Michelin XZX 185R14 to replace the fronts or
Yokohamas LT 195 75/14 for the rears. Both tires have had good reviews from
the list. So would it be best to go for 195s all around (keeping the
Aspens) or go back to the 185s (and keep the Xs on the rear) and have
reinforced all around? 

Thanks for any ideas.
David C.
