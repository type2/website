As a new comer to this forum, i apologize in advance for my ignorance..  PS&gt;
Thanks heaps to those of you that share your knowledge. I am too becoming an
on-line junky.

Living 1hr SW of Denver - Bailey -  we have a hill or two to negotiate, and
am considering an upgrade - non VW - to the engine.

I understand i have several options 
1. Porsche Carrera 2 from MSDS
2. Subaru from ?

Any one out there with experience with either ?  Other recommendations ?

Thanks, Adrian
