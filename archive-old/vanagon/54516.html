Subject:      95 Rialta FS, in Alabama.

the ads says:

1995 Rialta 21RD by Winnebago, 7K miles, self-contained, all extras,
like new, only $31,900. (205) 825-5386.

in the Auto Trader for 21 January 1997.
FYI: the 825- prefix is Dadeville, AL. it's on a direct line between
Birmingham and Auburn/Opelika (Columbus, GA). it's a small town, close
to a big lake over there. i have no idea what a VW/Winnebago is doing
in a town that size. but the ad has a picture and all.
