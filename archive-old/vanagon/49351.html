Subject: Re: Dogs on CCC's Mammoth Trip
From: Mark &amp; Kath &lt;markath_at_qnet_dot_com&gt;

&gt;     Dogs should be on a leash all the time in any outdoor enviroment.
&gt;     Why you ask?  Simple dogs have a BIG advantage over all nature:
&gt;     living with humans, getting feed well, in warm homes in the winter.
&gt;     Then for a monent they are let free in the wild, they really cause
&gt;     great harm to nature, just there smell on a trail is enough to
&gt;     keep most other animals away for a week. 
&gt;
&gt;     If you go to parks with your dogs, keep in mine many other animals
&gt;     are trying to servive there.

*******************************

This is NOT a &quot;park&quot; - This is public land that is administered by USDA 
Forest Service where the rules and regulations are completely different 
from those on public lands which are administered by USDI National Park 
Service. It is important to remember that all public lands are not 
administered by the same federal agencies and that these two agencies 
have completely different management philoshophies. Having areas, on 
USFS lands, that allow people the freedom to hike with their dogs is 
part of the plan. If members of the public prefer not to be around 
other people's dogs, they should spend their vacation time on National 
Park lands where dogs are strictly prohibited anywhere except in 
developed areas - where they must be leashed at all times!

Just to clarify the rules on the INYO National Forest, where this trip 
is taking place, dogs need to be on leashes that are no longer than 6 
feet in length while they are in developed areas, such as campgrounds, 
Visitor Centers, Interpretive Sites and in areas that are posted as 
such. Dogs are allowed to be off leashes on trails as long as they are 
controlable by sight or sound.

Hope this helps!
