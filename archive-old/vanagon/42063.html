 &gt; &gt; 4.  Where is a good place to get the 12 point tool for removing CV joints
 &gt; &gt; with the dreaded connections?  Thanks
 &gt; 
 &gt; I've used a 6-point metric allen wrench with no problems (I think it was
 &gt; 6mm but it could have been 7mm). You can buy the whole set of metric
 &gt; allens for under $10 or pay $12 for the one 12-point tool (and I'm only
 &gt; quoting a price I heard..I don't know of a source). 
 
Oh, dear, no.  I've never had the allen wrenches work, adn the K-D tool you 
can get at FLAPS is, well, I ruined three of them. 

Take $20, go find a Snap-On truck and get the tool from them.  It will last 
forever, which is probably longer than you need, but more than that it will 
not break under the van, so your knuckles, your blood pressure and your kid's 
ears will all be safe, and you won't have to swear, crawl out, clean up, go to 
FLAPS, get another cheap tool, come back, crawl under, break it again, 
swear....

Snap-On.  Just do it.  Ordinarily I don't buy tools from Snap-On because I'm 
not a pro mechanic relying on his tools all day every day, but for this 
particular application I recommend them without reservation.
