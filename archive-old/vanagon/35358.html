Subject: My Vanagon got wacked 

Hi folks

I am new to the list, and this is just great.
I was involved in an accident where someone hit me from behind with a large 
truck an d crashed in the drivers side rear corner of my 1984 1.9 liter 
Wolfsburg Vanagon. This vanagon has 160,000 miles on it. I am worried that the 
insurance company will try total my van.... I love my Vanagon!!!! I put alot of 
work into this baby... I just want it back to the way it was. This was a large, 
tall, truck , so when it hit it did not do any damage to the motor that I can 
see.   Does anyone know how the insurance company value this vehicle at this age 
and mileage????

Thanks in advance
