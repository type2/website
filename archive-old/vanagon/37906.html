Subject: OH NO!!! (was: howabout a new category on the stats?)


&gt;hey now,
&gt;
&gt;why not have RetroWesties added to the stats...RuMbA wants her own 
category!
&gt;
&gt;jonathan ('74 RetroWestia...RuMbA..)

Uh-oh... don't start such a dangerous trend! Nex thing you know, people
will want seperate categories for retro-sunroofs, retro-deluxes, and
(shudder) retro-engines!

Please, please don't turn that blabbermouth Steve with his V6anagon loose
on us again! All he does is talk about how great the engine in it is,
how macho he is as a result, etc. etc.!
