&gt;I cant answer your questions about the per-mile cost of a water-cooled
                                                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^

                                       ^^^^^^^
&gt;actually don't drive a bus because of parsimony, I drive it because I adore
&gt;the _ethos_ behind its design; but your questions are economic in nature
&gt;and on economic terms I don't believe that the bus can be surpassed--if you
&gt;will maintain it.

The Type IV engine, used in 1972-1983 VW vans, is air-cooled, and a much
sturdier,
                                                  ^^^^^^^^^^
more powerful and longer-lasting engine than the pre-1972 VW engines.
