&gt; Now I've noticed two electrical items that don't seem to have any purpose and
&gt; can't find any reference to in any manuel.  On the dashboard, to the left of
&gt; the heater controls (whats to control?:) there is a small, unmarked aluminum
&gt; socket with a wire coming out behind the dash.  I haven't been able to trace
&gt; the wire yet.  Does anyone know what that thing is?

Congratulations!  You appear to have found the &quot;silver socket&quot;.  Tho I own
an older vehicle {'78} there was a long thread on this many months ago. 
The final upshot of which was that no one knew what it was for.  The most
likely function was that the socket was for a plug-in seat heater that 
was only available in Europ{. 
 
&gt; Also, on the sink cabinet (I have a standard model - no stove or refrig),
&gt; there is a panel of LEDs.  On the left are water tank indicators and on the
&gt; right are battery indicators.  Between these there is one green LED which is
&gt; unlabeled.  No reference in the manuel or elec diagrams.  Anyone know about
&gt; this one?

I dunno.  Maybe someone else?
