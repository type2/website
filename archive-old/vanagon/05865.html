Subject: dim lights when revved

Well, now I'm starting to have doubts about my auxiliary battery charging
system, or least the capability of the alternator to deliver enough current
to handle both simultaneously.
Reason being - I've noticed at night that the Batt and EGR lights are
barely glowing, but the weird thing is that they both go out when I'm
idling - its
only when I'm actually driving under load that I can see this.
So far I've not noticed any problems with the charging, just this weird
light behaviour. I'm going to have to get some gauges installed in this
thing!

Anyone with clues let me know. In the meantime I'll go out and haul in the
manual and see if I can figure anything out from schematics...
