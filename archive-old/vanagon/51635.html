Subject: Re: 87 Vanagon GL Fuel Starvation on Down Incline/Gas tank overflow

&gt; On another related subject, the PO had the gas tank replaced just  
&gt; before we purchased the vehicle.  I can't for the life of me prevent  
&gt; the tank from overflowing when filling up, unless I use miniscule  
&gt; pressure at the pump.  Does anyone have any pointers as to what, if  
&gt; anything, may be wrong.  Or is this a feature?
