Subject: '81 Vanagon parting out in Denver

I have an '81 Vanagon L for sale in Denver. The motor, trans, outside 
sliding door handle, and turn signal assemblies are already
gone, but everything else is still there. It has no rust, but some 
slight damage near the left turn signal. I am asking $350, it has a 
clear CO title. I would also consider parting it out.
Please E-mail if interested.
Thanks,
Josh
