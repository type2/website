Subject: Re: Knock, knock (who, or what's there?)

&gt; I'm scared to ask, but...
&gt; 
&gt; The last couple of times I've started my 85 I've heard 3 or 4 &quot;knocks&quot; as 
&gt; soon as the engine turns, then it stops.  I don't hear it at all after 
&gt; that.  Is something terrible about to happen?!?!?!
&gt; 
Sounds like lifter noise. Have you taken a few short trips lately, or 
not run the engine at all? Three things which seem to affect lifter 
noise: frequent short trips; letting the engine sit for a week or 
more; dirty oil.

I changed mine to synthetic Mobil 1 oil and noise went away - only 
time it comes back now is if I let the engine sit for 1-2 weeks or 
more (the oil drains out of the hydr. lifters)

It's not a big problem if it's only occurring for a few seconds at 
startup - but it's wise to try to reduce / eliminate the problem 
before it gets worse. Take the van for a good long drive to heat up 
the oil, then give it an oil/filter change. Try to avoid short trips 
where oil does not get hot enough to burn off combustion by-products.
