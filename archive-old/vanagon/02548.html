Subject:      staying awake (caffeine, ephedrine, accupuncture, ...)

well ... what i do on long trips (or used to do, anyway) was to set a
cooler right behind the front seats (but within easy reach), and fill the
cooler with ice and pepsi and little 'snack bags'. each snack bag was a
zip-loc sandwich bag with gum, snickers, and maybe some life savers, a ham
sandwich, or an apple in it. the pepsi and caffeine would keep me awake.

only trouble was, after about 500 miles of chomping on that stuff, there
was no way i could get to sleep that night! 8(  it's better (Hindsight
talking here) to go shorter and take more stops.  but then, i do most things
a lot slower these days. :)
