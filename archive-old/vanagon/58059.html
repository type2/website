Subject: Re: throw out bearing

&gt;About 18 months ago I had my clutch replaced with a new sachs unit. and 
&gt;all was ok untill wendsday when it went south on me. The shop that has 
&gt;the van now showed me the problem with the old clutch, the throw out 
&gt;bearing did not match the pressure plate.. Is it possible that the other 
&gt;shop tried to bluff there way through the instal by placing a beattle 
&gt;t/o bearing with a vanagon pressure plate?? 

Actually, a Vanagon *does* use the same throwout bearing as a Beetle.
