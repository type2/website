Subject: 84 dont smoke no more


&gt;
&gt;The story so far:  about two months ago a sudden increase (or should it be a
&gt;decrease?) in mileage from 27 mpg to 10 mpg. About a month ago, increase of
&gt;about
&gt;ten thousand percent in black smoke emission.  (Sure discourages tail-gaters!) 
&gt;Lots of excellent advice and suggestions from you folk, change of ECU and Temp.
&gt;sensor 2, adjustment of AFM.  Minimal improvement.
&gt;
&gt;Friday, finally took it to a mechanic.  It took him three hours to figure out
&gt;what was causing the problem and I think it was a great piece of detective
work.
&gt;
&gt;Wire coming from the O2 sensor on the 84 is a single lead that plugs into
&gt;another
&gt;lead coming out of the wiring harness.  That harness lead goes into the
multipin
&gt;connector.  For reasons known only to themselves, VW engineers made that
harness
&gt;lead a co-axial cable with the shield grounded.  Somewhere along that lead,
&gt;inside the harness, the insulation around the inner wire broke and allowed the
&gt;signal to ground on the shield.  
&gt;
&gt;The mechanic, Niel, took endless trouble to explain the operation to me.  Seems
&gt;at 600 degrees the O2 sensor generates a 0.5 volt signal to the computer.  Over
&gt;that voltage indicates a rich mixture and the ECU decreases the fuel flow.
&gt;Under
&gt;0.5 volts indicates a weak mixture and the ECU feeds in more gas.  A grounded
&gt;wire will produce a 0.0 voltage so guess what the ECU does?!!.  Niel simply
took
&gt;apart the multipin connector and checked the voltage at the pin, then cut
&gt;off the
&gt;faulty lead and replaced it with a single wire lead.  Now ole Smoky purrs like
&gt;a kitten and I am looking forward to 27mpg. again.
