Subject: Distributor Numbers &amp; Questions

I have two Vacuum advance distributors, but they look a little different. 
My Bentley doesn't identify either of these on it's sparc advance curves 
tables. The part numbers are: 

113 905 205 AN
and
039 905 205

My bus is a '71. Bob Hoover told me to look for a distributor marked 
-205P, which I will do.

The 205 AN dist. is in pretty good shape, so I'll probably use that one 
for now if I can get it adjusted to run right...also the 039 905 205 has 
a different vacuum setup, so it's probably not right anyway.

My questions are:

1. Can anyone identify the right year models for the dist's I have?

2. If I use the 205 AN, should I set it to the specs for the 205P, since 
it's going in a bus designed for the 205P?

Barring any advice to the contrary, my plan is to just use a timing light 
and dwell meter to set it to ~25 degrees dwell and 8.5 to 11 degrees 
advanced (from the 205P specs).

Thanks! Joe
