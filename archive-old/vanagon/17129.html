Subject: Re: dashboard fan?

Martha Rubin says:
&gt;saw an ad in one of the VW mags in the last year advertising
&gt;from Barney's a VERY powerful dash fan.  I would think the more
&gt;power the better, as the air circ. in these cars is otherwise next
&gt;to nothing.
&gt;
I noticed in the latest HVW that it appears that they are selling their 
inline heater helper fan as a 'poor man's air conditioner'.  The price is 
$56 and it flows about 200cfm (I think - all of this from memory, mind you). 
 As we have discussed on the list, you can probably get a like fan from West 
Marine for $19.  BTW, thanks to whoever told us about their neat catalog 
(was it you, Martha?) - lot's of cool stuff!
