Subject: Re: Cheapo Oil Thermometer ???



Mine is a lab-thingee, all stainless steel, dial gauge, probe about 7&quot; long.
 Acquired... surplus, I think.  This series of posts caused me to go looking
for it.  Couldn't find it, which means they probably aren't available as
surplus any more and probably cost the earth new.  (I only used it to check
the accuracy of oil temp gauges.)  I got a humungous mercury thermometer
(also surplus) for a steam system but the sensor is about an inch around and
the linear scale STARTS at 200.

J. C. Whitney has an oil temp gauge for about $25 (gauge + sender).  I'll get
one, see how accurate it is, post the results.
