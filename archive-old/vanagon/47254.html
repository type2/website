Subject: That damn cooling system !
Date: Mon, 22 Jul 1996 23:51:11 -0400 (EDT)


Help !!! Tim Smith &amp; Joel Walker,

Had just returned from a trip and that darn coolant was spewing again
from the rear coolant reservoir. I must say I was doing over 75 mph
with the aircon full blast. This happens when you park the vehicle after
a hard run. 
I dont seem to be able to get Barsleak at my local autoparts store.
Is it known by another name also ?
I am going to use it and retorquing. Looks like no other way out.
Hate to get stranded half way between New Jersey and Florida.
Planning to make this trip shd ortly.
By the way does one use any kind of sealant between the heads and
the cylinder liner ? I noticed the seal , like the aircooled, is
only a metal gasket. With the water-boxer this dont seem like too much
of a seal. When the engine runs hot the damn thing will surely expand
and with two different metals iron  vs aluminium I cannot see how
a reliable seal is possible although the standard recommendation is
torqueing to the right specs.
Will you VW experts pls comment since this seems to be a common
woe amongst us Vanagonites since most repairs are only short lived
and the thing leaks again e.g. after 20K+ miles.
