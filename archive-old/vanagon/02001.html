Continuing the orange discussion well beyond what it's worth...

&gt; back in 80-83. just like there's blue, and then there's Blue, there are
&gt; different versions of Orange.  even Bobo would have to agree with that. :)
&gt; 

Yes this is true.  And Bobo even contains two versions of orange himself where
the previous owner (rightly) decided that the green engine hatch clashed with
the overall paint scheme and painted the engine hatch orange.  Unfortunately,
the only orange paint he could get his hands on was some cans of orange spray
paint.  Even though he did a truly professional job (no drips, runs, or
orange-peels), Bobo's butt is definately a different shade of orange, as is a
spot on his nose.  It DOES look better than green, but if it's daylight you
can tell that the colors don't match.  Oh well, it adds personality.

So if you see an orange and white `74 bus with a lighter-orange engine hatch
driving around in Oregon it might be Bobo.

Hey, that reminds me of another data-base item that Joel should keep track of:
bumper stickers!  Why, you could fill volumes with just the Grateful Dead
bumper stickers people have on their buses!  I saw a great one the other day,
it said &quot;Who are the Grateful Dead and why do they keep following me?&quot;  The
only sticker I've been willing to paste on Bobo so far is a &quot;Fukingrueven&quot;
one, figuring that's as close to Fahrvergnuegen as he'll ever get...

Well, enough drivel for now.
