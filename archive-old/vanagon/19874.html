Subject: RE:Blowing Coolant Hoses Right and Left (VW Service)


&gt; Sergio...please do not make generalizations that ALL new VWs are
&gt; pieces of shit...or do not last 200k miles like old beetles etc...

&gt; I'm sorry that you have had tons of problems with your VW...perhaps
&gt; you have a lemon...perhaps its bad karma...or VANma as the case
&gt; may be...but your sample results don't jive with my sample results...
&gt; therefore IMHO, your sample results are not valid!
&gt; 
&gt; Ric
&gt; 

Ric, I agree with you and some others that my problem should not be a generalization. Sorry, you
are wrong about my sample results not being valid. I may not have enough sampling but I can tell
you that from all the VW's I had, only the 2 new ones gave me trouble. It's not karma, It's just
frustration dealing with service because as all of you mentioned.... MY PROBLEMS, I believe, is 
the incompetence of the dealer mechanics, because I loved this van when I bought it until that 
FI recall.  Could that have been extorsion ?... you know... An induced recall to get business?

OF course, always, and forever, this and all my other messages are my opinions, mine and only my opinions! 

Thanks for sharing your opinion!
