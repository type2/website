 I believe you, really I do, but I've looked inside 3 quatro 4000's in the
last
 2 weeks, and didn't find a single one with a gauge panel that could fit into
 SyncroBeast.  Did I miss something, or what?
  &gt;&gt;


funny you should say this...
it doesnt have to be from a Quattro, but the Audi 4000 S console gauge
cluster from about a '81-'84 4000 S will fit right into the Vanagon &quot;heater
duct&quot; cover panel right behind the shifter. the VDO gauges are already even
tilted towards the driver.
I think they come w/ the VDO voltmeter, the h2o temp, and the oil psi gauges.
(you can change or add others to your liking)

when installed it looks stock!!
