Subject: Re: tank key



&gt;I recently bought an 83 Westie ... but the key to the water tank is
&gt;missing. I tried the paper clip trick to open it, but it didn't work.
&gt;Does anyone know if this is a &quot;generic&quot; key or are they all keyed
&gt;differently? Is there any other way to open it?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks

The story, as I understand it, is that on early to mid 80's models, 
Westfalia used a German lock cylinder that had been built for postal boxes 
in Germany.  Besides requiring metric tools to make a key (which US 
locksmiths generally don't have), apparantly key blanks were never made 
available for German postal security reasons.  

When I bought my '85, it was missing the key.  I could not find a locksmith 
who could make a key (although I think someone once posted to the list that 
they were able to get a duplicate key made at a locksmith). I finally ended 
up having the locksmith simply pick the lock for me and remove the cap, and 
eventually I replaced the recepticle. New replacement recepticles come with 
a plastic key like the late 80's Westies, but at $50 that's an expensive 
solution.
