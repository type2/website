Subject: Re: Rear hatch lock question.

Do you have power door locks? If you do, when the key slot is left in the
horizontal position, locking either front door locks the hatch lock. You
can use the key to open the locked hatch by turning the key all the way to
the right, a bit past vertical and then push the key in and the hatch will
open.


&gt;The rear hatch lock does not seem to unlock using the key. The key can't
&gt;catch the lock for some reason. The only way I can get it open is from
&gt;the inside by removing the plastic latch cover on the door and pushing
&gt;on the metal bar inside.
&gt;
&gt;Can anybody famaliar with this problem suggest a solution?
