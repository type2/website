Subject: Re: Paul's starter problems


I guess I had better put the new starter bushing in then....
It's funny how so mnay of these threads apply to one or another current 
projects of mine.  Maybe that's because I seem to be having to fix 
everything...

What's the best way to drive out the old starter bushing? Screwdriver and 
hammer?

Greg
