So after the two of us spent an hour getting the gods-rotted heat
riser tube bolted together, I find that the flange that holds the
exhaust manifold up against the exhaust port is welded on at an angle
-- with the stud nuts tightened down all the way, one side of the
flange is flush, and the other isn't.  Looking down at it from the
top, it's obvious that the pipe itself is pointed straight at the
head, and the flange is at an angle.

AAAAAARRRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHHH!

Since the old muffler is in several rust-ridden pieces, this means I'm
bus-less until I can get a replacement shipped to me and installed.
Guess I'll be making some calls tomorrow....
