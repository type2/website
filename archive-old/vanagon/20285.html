Subject: hello

Umm... Hello to all out there.  This is my first time on the             attempt at sending
a message I hope it is correct                     .  I have been reading the \\    is list for a couple of days
and quickly came to realize that this list would be most suitable.
I am currently an 84 Vanagon owner.  I have owned two be usses in the
past both air cooled       cool     cooled.  Needless to say I learned a lot about
German endineer      gineereing    ing     ring          eg ngineering and decided to venture into the more modern
version of the bus.  
	When I purchased the 84 It was not running.  After spending
many hours With Bently and Haynes I finally pinpointed the problem
to be a &quot;shorted f  &quot; fuel injector.  Well Now the van     bus runs quite well   l, plenty
of power and all                    of poe wer.  The only problem now is that it seems to be running a bit rich.
The symptomes         indicators are smelly exhaust, and a bit of black smoke.  This is botherd some tome I am wondering if any  one has some suggestions to put forth.
Things I have done:
All new ignition
Checked for vacuum leaks and replaced rotted tubes.
Replaced fuel injector (with used one)
New pr  fuel pressure regulator.

Just to name a few.

R Thank you 
Robert Copich
