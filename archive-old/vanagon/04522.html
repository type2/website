&gt;Hmmm, the weakly list shows FOUR Eurvan Campers!
&gt;Would these be MV Weekenders, or are there four Winnebago Campers on the
&gt;net already?
&gt;Or are these European owners, who probably have had Westfalia Eurovans for
&gt;YEARS now?

actually, there are three weekenders and one winnebago camper (the 95).
at least, that's what i thought he said.  i couldn't figure out whether to
call the weekenders 'campers' or not, then decided that what the heck ...
they've got the bed and the pop-top and the curtains and all the stuff that
an old 60's series 'camper' had (in the el cheapo model), so why not.
