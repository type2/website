So it's too hard to sweevil the seets eh?  Try this.  Slide the seats out of 
the tracks by sliding them forward until they latch and then releasing the  
latch.  Now you have a seat in your hand so set it down and you'll see that 
the sweevil is bolted to the underpinnings.  The nuts are retained so you
can safely remove the bolts.  Now you'll notice that the sweevil comes 
apart and you can see the bearing surfaces.  Clean them well with a non-
recyclable t-shirt or your favorite wiping thingy.  Lube sparingly with 
white grease or your favorite non-runny lubricant.  Reassemble and voila'
sweevils are swivels again.

For a fun time, Rain X only the drivers side of a friends car in a surreptitious
manner.  The next time s/he drives in the rain with a passenger...sheer terror.
