Subject: RE: Fridge removal in 1991 Westy

OK, from recent memory (Bently is out in the bus):


Detach and remove the fridge vent cover plate on the left side of the bus.
Make sure the vent itself, is not hung up on the body, so it is free to
follow the fridge when 
you pull it out after all the other steps are done. While you are there,
make sure your propane is turned off.

Remove the fridge door, and the drawer and the doors from the cabinets
on both sides of the fridge. 

Remove the shelf from the forward cabinet, you need to pull out one or two
of the small rubber things that hold them  down, I pulled them out gently by
twisting with a pair of pliers. You'll see its really held in with a small
nail in the center of the rubber molding. Once you can remove the ones on
top of one side, pivot the shelf  up and
remove it, leaving the other rubber dealies undisturbed.

Unplug the 110 fridge power line from the outlet at the upper back of the
forward
cabinet.

Disconnect the two plastic 12v connections, one big and one smaller, you see
up near the 110V power cord. 

In about the same space, disconnect the gas line junction to the fridge, its
the one toward the back of the cabinet, the stove line is in front (toward
the center of 
the bus). No need to disconnect the stove.

While you still have you head in that cabinet, remove the two small screws
that are
aligned vertically, about eight inches apart, on the side of the cabinet that is
against the fridge.

Get your head outta there! Face the fridge, and remove all the little gray
rubber
screw covers you see, use a flat blade screw driver and pry, but please be
gentle.
Then remove the screws.

Remove the panel, I think you have to tilt it from the top first, if I
recall correctly.

Go round to the cabinet behind (to the left) of the fridge, and remove the
two small
screws in the fridge side panel, aligned vertically, just like the ones in the
other cabinet. (Note, these are countersunk, and one of mine was buried in
sawdust,
I could not even see there was a screw there, but by probing I finally did
find it.

That should do it! Now, gently pull the fridge out, toward the center of the
bus.
Geeze, sure is dirty back there! After you clean that mess  up, its a good
time to
examine the back wall of the bus, behind the insulation, for rust!

On the Propex installation in general, I made quite a lot of progress
-almost finished- in spare moments yesterday and today. I'll post an update
tonight.

Good luck,

Tom F.
