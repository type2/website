With reference to the review of the '95 Teeforabago -

You must have sore fingers after that - it was a good read.

&lt;munch&gt;

&gt;... (The Camper will be the only '95  EuroVan sold in the 
U.S.,
&gt;and it will be available only at 110  dealerships.)

Am I reading that right?  There will be *no* other T4s  sent 
across the Atlantic Puddle?  No vans, Kombis, et al.?

And is this Winnie a conversion of a pop-top LWB T4 or a 
back-pack squatting upon the basic chassis of a Transporter? 
(like those things I see in '70s detective shows ...)

&gt;The momentumcreated by all that  weight might also explain the 

&gt;noticeable brake fade, which is generally  uncommon in 
&gt;German vehicles.

Hah!  My T4 does that!  Mind you, I've never changed the brake 
pads.

&gt;Curves in the road emphasize the Camper's poor roll 
&gt;control - at  least compared with the modern minivan 
&gt;standard.

I was going to mention the optional front and rear anti-roll 
bars, but I don't know anything about 'em and my blue thing has 
fared quite nicely without 'em, thank-you-very-much.
