&gt; To change the subject a bit, Why don't Vanagon drivers wave?

Whaddya mean we don't wave?  I wave at every other Vanagon I see and get
waves back about 1 of 10 or 12 times.  I'd certainly wave back at any
Splittie/Loaf/Eurovan that waved to me.

On a recent trip I even got 2 waves back out of 4 initiated.
