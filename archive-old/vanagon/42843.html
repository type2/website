Subject: Re: The Yellow-striped Modulator 

&gt;you sent me a part #003-325-391, I can get that part but it has an A 
&gt;at the end of the #.  I'm not sure if this is going to work for you or 
&gt;not.  The part without an A is not availible to my knowledge.
&gt;
&gt;  I didn't research to see if these parts are the same but I think they 
&gt;are.  The part with an A at the end is $40.00 plus tax, shipping &amp; 
&gt;handiling.  Let me know if you want to try this option.

  In case anyone else is laboriously tracking this thing down for
 me, it's been found. Jim _at_ Bus Boys should have it here tomorrow.
 Right Jim? Kyle found another one in his pile. I'd like to thank
 everyone involved. All seven hundred. There are 4 import shops around
 my area and one VW dealer. They all told me it was a dead part with 
 no replacement. Back in the old days that would have been the end of
 it. &quot;Who you gonna call?&quot; This net and the &quot;groups&quot; just jacked my
 status up to &quot;Wizard&quot;.       _/\_    west
