Subject: FS: '85 Westy

I have an '85 Westy for sale in Bedford, Tx (Dallas/Ft. Worth area).
I am the second owner, have owned it since August, 1987, and have done 
all of the maintenance myself.

Brown, tan poptop (original)
96,000 miles
5 new Michelin XZX 185R14 tires (3 months, 3,000 miles)
steering rack just professionally rebuilt 30 days ago
New upper ball joints and tie rod ends
within the last 5,000 miles:
  - new CV joints from Transform (their most expensive)
  - new front rotors
  - front calipers rebuilt
  - new front bearings and races
  - new front pads
  - new rear drums
  - new rear shoes
  - new rear wheel cylinders
Refrigerator just removed and serviced
Has trailer hitch
Interior is in very good shape, though carpet in the front is a 
little dirty

Problems:
  - paint needs to be rubbed out and waxed (I've done about half of 
    it and it looks good, just haven't been able to finish it)
  - Poptop seal needs to be replaced (I have the seal, don't have the 
    time)
  - Numerous rock dings on the front end 
  - Front poptop screen has 6 or so 1&quot; tears (were there when I 
    bought it)
  - two cigarette burns in the driver's seat (also there when I 
    bought it, hasn't been smoked in since)
  - the air conditioner compresser froze up several years ago and 
    hasn't been fixed
  - outside window plastic trim discolored due to local sun and heat

Will include the Bentley manual, poptop seal, and some miscellaneous 
stuff.  I'm asking $4,500 for it, and probably will stick close to 
that.  

By the way, I just drove it from Dallas to Asheville, NC last week 
and back pulling a small motorcycle trailer with a 500+ lb. motorcycle on 
it.  Ran 65 to 70 most of the trip, ran flawlessly.  No problems.  I 
wouldn't hesitate to take it anywhere immediately.

This has been a tough decision, but lifestyle changes force me into this.
I have owned seven busses and Westy's continuously since 1966, and 
had expected to own this one for a lot more years.  Hate to see it go.
Email me if interested, or phone at 817-354-5969.  I'll probably put 
it in the paper this weekend at $4850.
