Subject: Window trim...this just in...


I bought new wiper blades today at a autoglass shop and I asked the guy
behind the counter about the rubber window seal trim. He said that it is
impossible (Hmmm) to replace when the glass is still in the car. Unlike
other trim, the vanagon trim fits into a very thin slot in the rubber and
is held in by a barb. The tool I described in an earlier post will not
work. But the good news is that the trim does not exert any appreciable
force to keep the glass in place (unlike thicker trim).
