Subject:      Vanagon books

Without much luck, I've been looking for a supplier for two vanagon books
that I've heard about.  They are:

&quot;The Pocket Mechanic, Volkswagen Transporter 1.9 and 2.1 Liter Water
Cooled From 1985&quot; by Peter Russek Publications, Ltd out of England

and

VW Bus Custom Handbook by Laurence Meredith, from The Red House, ISBN
1-870979-47-8 by Richard Kurtz

If anyone out there knows how I can find these books, please let me know.

Thanks,
Ivan
