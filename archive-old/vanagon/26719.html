&gt; &gt; Yes yes, I know that Bob Hoover recently wrote a very informative spiel 
&gt; &gt; on this very subject but I was wondering if I SHOULD replace my brake 
&gt; &gt; lines.  You see I bought this '66 Westy with no brakes ('cept hand 
&gt; &gt; brake).  I look in the master cylinder and jar, and both are bone dry.  I 
&gt; &gt; removed the master cylinder and had no fluid come from any of the 
&gt; &gt; three(?) lines at all (which reminds me-why are there three brake lines 
&gt; &gt; coming out of the cyl.?).  This bus hasn't been registered since 1983 so 
&gt; 
&gt; 2 lines to the front, 1 to the back, which splits on the driver's (LIL) 
&gt; side of the tranny
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm none too surprised.  Here's the question, should I try to flush out 
&gt; &gt; and use the existing lines or should I just replace the whole system?  



You may have a much larger problem then you expected.  When a system 
is run dry, it tends to distroy the master and wheel cylinders.  This 
is because with out the fluid to keep everything lubricated the seals 
dry up and crack.  The first order of business would be to find out 
where the fluid leaked out in the first place.  fill up the resivoir 
and let the fluid sit for a while.  then, do your standard counter-
clockwise gravity bleed on all four wheels.  again, just let it sit 
while the seels soak up some fluid.  When you are finished, very 
gently bleed the system the rest of the way.  Then you can asess the 
damage.  If no fluid ever got to any of your cylinders, even with a 
vaccume bleeder, then replace the line.  flushing is just a &quot;duct 
tape&quot; solution.  it is nearly impossible to remove all the crud and 
it will eventually all end up in your cylinders.  If you don't find 
any line leaks, it is in your cylinders.  remove each tire and pump 
the brakes. check to see if propper stoping power is applied.  Do NOT 
pump the brakes once the drums are removed or you will end up with 
cylinder parts everywhere and a big mess.  If no leaks are obvious 
yet, check the wheel cylinders.  if you can, pull the boots back 
far enough to see under them and check for fluid.  if there is any 
dampness, replace the cylinder.  if they are the type that the boots 
cant be pulled back on, watch closely for any oozing.  
    As far as the three lines are concerned, this is pretty normal, 
it sounds like a standard 3 channel system.  Most cars have 
independant front brakes and a single line for the rear.  This is 
because the fronts provide 60 to 80% of your stopping power and need 
to be a little more reliable.
  be prepared to replace the master and At Least one wheel 
cylinder.  
    Good luck.
