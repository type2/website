Subject: Re: DaBoat 2-liter update - it lives! (long)availability of Cofap piston/liners

Your comment about Cofap going out of the VW piston/liner bussiness just about 
gave me a heart attack since I was going to rebuild a 1800cc this winter 
sometime.  I checked with my part supplier (Bow-wow parts in Surrey BC Canada 
1-800-663-6822) and they have lots of Cofap piston/liners sets.  His supplier 
gets them directly out of Brazil.  My current 1700 uses them and I have no 
complaints.  Of course I was paranoid enough to weight all the pistons, and 
check the piston cylinder clearances and the ring end gap but that is just my 
way of rebuilding things.  About your hydralic lifters, I got a kit from Weber 
cams (Not Web-cam) and the instructions stated to run them with air in them from
 about 20 minutes with a 0.006 inch clearance (like solid lifters)  After the 
 air was out ( ie unable to compress them at all by prying on the rocker arm 
 with a screw driver) they could be adjusted to zero clearance.  They were 
 somewhat vague on the preload idea so I adjusted them to zero clearance with 
 the engine as hot as i could get it.  This made them too tight when cold but 
 at zero lash when the engine was hot.  I will probably take them out and look 
 at them next summer to make sure that they are OK.  Can't do it now since the 
 wife needs the other car (it is cold in Alberta these days) and the van is 
 needed for the car pool to work.

Does anyone know the 800 number for VW of Canada.  I have a 88 Fox and though 
there is somesort of recall on it the dealer has been sitting on his hands 
about it.

Bye for now
