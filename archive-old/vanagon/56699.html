Subject: Search for a bumper!!

To Whom it may concern out there,
I currently own a 1990 Vanagon Camper. It needs a new or used rear 
bumper. It could be partial or whole. If you have one, or know of one, 
please contact me.
                                  Yours Sincerely,
                                           BUMPERLESS
