Subject: Re: Flaky fuel gauge


&gt;Maybe You can help me with mine then.. I replace the float on mine, 
&gt;replaced the fuel gauge and voltage stablizier, and still refuses to 
&gt;work.. but, if I take the float out of the tank and ground the top of the 
&gt;sender, I can make it work just fine.. So I figured, bad ground, right?  
&gt;So I did the same thing when it was in the tank, and still wouldn't 
&gt;work.. It would just always read full... :(

If it reads full I think that means there is a ground somewhere where there
shouldn't be, like you say. Have you checked the circuit with a multimeter?
If it all checks out OK, maybe something's obstructing the float when it's
in the tank.
