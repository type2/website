&gt;&gt;Full of useless information that will never lead to financial gain,

&gt;
&gt;Great little table, IMHO.  Financial gain?  Are we in this for 
&gt;financial gain?  I thought we were in this because we love doing it,
&gt;and because among the list members there are answers which may help 
&gt;other people who love it.

BELIEVE me when I say I am not in this for financial gain.  Although
I do buy &amp; fix up &amp; sell several buses, I do it for my own pleasure.
I would rather sell a part for a fair price, or horse-trade, or give
it to someone if I felt it would give them more pleasure than it
ever would me.  I could never walk away from a deal snickering over
how I raped someone on the price.

People have asked me why I would rebuild an engine no-charge for a
friend who couldn't afford to pay, or drop &amp; install a transmission
for someone I had only talked to over the phone once.  My only
answer is 'this is what I enjoy doing'.  If I weren't helping them
work on their bus, I'd be working on one of mine anyway.  I'd like 
to think if I ever needed help, someone would be there to help me.
(stupid hippie karma thing)

It really bothers me sometimes when I see the prices some of the
'shops' charge for service, or the prices some of the 'pros' ask
for their wares at swap meets.  I then realize that is what these
people do to earn a living, and they have every right to.  I don't
have to patronize them, but sometimes the little guy does.

What I do with volkswagens is my hobby, and I don't have to answer
to anyone other than myself.  If I were to take money from someone 
in exchange for helping them it would take all the fun out of it, 
because then I would be working for them.

I have to step down from my soapbox, because the altitude is making
me dizzy.  I also can't remember what my point is, if I ever had
one.

&quot;If two spacecraft were both travelling at light speed, but in one
 of them a man was eating an ear of corn, I don't think it would
 make a difference.  What I'm trying to say is, corn is good isn't
 it?&quot;
