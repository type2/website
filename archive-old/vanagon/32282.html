&gt; (No, I'm not going to be demonstrating anything, I'm one of
&gt; the guys that makes the lights flash.)

Isn't that the way it always goes, the really important
people stand behind the light while the one in front of
the light gets all the glory.

&gt; At any rate, ETKA products will be shown alongside ADP's
&gt; other automated parts catalog offerings.

Have I buttered you up enough?  No one on THIS list would
ask you to do anything untoward, but if they're handing
out free samples that have a V and a W in a circle, I'm
sure somebody here could find a use for it.
