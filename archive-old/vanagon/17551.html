Subject: Re: Installing swivel seats in '73 Bus

i too am unsure about whether or not the bulkhead behind the seat of my 73'
provides any structural strength. anyone out there with a 77' or something,
please check out your swivel seat and tell us &quot;swivel seat wannabes&quot; if
there is any other structural metal welded into to your busses to
compensate for being sans bulkhead.

p.s. i am considering doing the same surgery on my 73' to install a swivel seat.

&gt;&gt; So, do we know it is OK to remove that thang? Doesn't it provide some sort
&gt;&gt; of structural support, or is it a useless evolutionary remnant?

&gt;All the '78 or '79 I've seen with the Vanagon style seats simply
&gt;looked like it was never put in at all with no other changes so I
&gt;say it does nothing for the body structure, my only question though is
&gt;the floor sufficient to support a self supporting seat, I know our
&gt;drivers seat doesn't touch the metal wall, but in a collision it would
&gt;be there for impact resistance, does anyone with a real late Bus know if
&gt;the seat mount area got reinforced upon the fitment of the later seats?
&gt;In fact did it maybe become flat like a Vanagon? with a piece welded
&gt;over the little dip down area? I looked at one a few years back but
&gt;can't remember.
