So Norman Leong says:
&gt; 
&gt; A couple of thoughts on this matter:
&gt; 
&gt; If I recall correctly, you have a '91 T3, so unless you've been abusing
&gt; the arms, it's probably in OK shape.  I read somewhere on the Porschephiles
&gt; list that you can check your blades when you get home at the end of the
&gt; day and press the blade edge against the glass in the opposite direction
&gt; that it's starting to get a bias towards, so that it has all night to try
&gt; and &quot;straighten out&quot;

Ja, Ja, I like this idea better than twisting the arms.  Less chance of
me screwing them up. ;)

&gt; Since you're going to be wandering around &quot;recycling&quot; yards in RC (are
&gt; you breathing through a snorkel yet?) searching for that hi-beam lens,
&gt; you might want to be on the lookout for a LH arm off a GTI/GLI/? be-
&gt; cause they have the built in deflector on the arm to increase the down-
&gt; force against the windshield.  I'm not saying that the arm(s) will fit
&gt; interchangeably on the shaft, but if they do, it might be worth a shot.

Blub....Blub..... well, that's a good point since Sunrise and Fitzpatrick
were under a bit of a deluge.  I already have some kind of air foil on
my drivers side wiper arm, so I don't think I need the foil for that.

Regarding triple blades, I think I'll wait till they come out with 
pentium blades so I can be Intel correct! ;)

(I'm now putting up my Pentium joke deflector shield :O )
