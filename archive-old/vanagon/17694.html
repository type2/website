Subject: Is this vapor lock ???
Date: Tue, 16 May 95 21:27:27 CDT

 Hi,

	I might be encountering a mild case of vapor lock, but i'm
	not sure, so here I am .  Its a warm day, i am cruising
	thru town , stopping and going, stoppping and goin again
	because of all these stop signs; after about 1/2 hour of
	this, and a particularly long idle at one stop sign, I
	step on the gas and it putters out (ie. the engine quits)
	I try to start it again , and still , it turns over,
	but nothing ignites. I roll to the side of the road, wait
	a few minutes, and then I start it up by really slamming
	on the accelerator repeatedly, then it slowly gets going.
	this happened to me three times already. I'm thinking that
	for sure my idle is set too low, and I am flooding the manifold.
	Is this vapor lock ? Its a WEBER progressive (i think DFEV).
	I have to go thru chicago this weekend, and I don't want
	to stall out on the Kennedy or something ! Wizards, help !
			thanks, guntram
