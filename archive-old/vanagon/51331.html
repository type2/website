Subject: Broken Sliding door handle--80 vanagon
Date: Wed, 06 Nov 96 14:13:02 -0500
From: Mark Howser &lt;mchowser_at_3rivers_dot_net&gt;

I have a broken sliding door handle(outside handle) on my 80 vanagon.  The
internal parts, including the lock core of the lock, are ok.  The handle
itself has been stressed to the point where it just fell off.  

Anyone know a good source for this part.  Also, how much is too much to pay?

Thanks, 

Mark
