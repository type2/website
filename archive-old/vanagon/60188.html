Malcolm, Wow !  First of all ,  thanks if I could buy you a beer I would.
 The CV's all seem good at the moment.  Probably could use a repack.  The van
is very nice , straight , rust free.  Everything works.  I took it to Fred's
garage in Redwood city CA which comes highly recommended by many members on
the list.  When I inquired about the compression check he said he could tell
it had good compression by driving it ..bad!!!  Guess thats what you get for
$25 on a busy monday.  Said he needed to do further diagnosis on the front
diff but not today.  I'm pretty sure it's going.  They estimated $1500 on the
trans but  I'd guess that is without the clutch bits.  $1300 replacing the
heads with used.  $1000 for the front diff.  $500 for misc stuff .  Grand
total $4300.  The asking price is $5k.  With the body and interior being
exceptional plus a working diff lock and AC.  107k mi.  Here comes the
relative value question?  What's she worth??? $1 to $2k???

Thanks much, Pete
