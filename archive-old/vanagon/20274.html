The silver socket is in the dash, below the glove box.  Some on the list 
have said it is for a heater or an air compressor.  some busses have it 
and ome do not - my '76 Camper does, Scott's '76 bus does not.
 
&gt;   Do you or Scott have the never-seen table??? Any chance I could get
&gt;   its dimensions to try and fabricate a replacement???

You must mean the bracket on the corner of the cabinet by the ice box - 
yes I have the table that goes there, and will measure and post details 
for you.
