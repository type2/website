Subject: List Split Announcement [IMPORTANT]

Dear List Members, 
 Due to the incredible traffic on this list and the fact that many people have
signed off because of the volume, and the time it takes to run it, I've
accepted an offer by Ken Hooper (bighouse_at_socomm_dot_net) to host an Aircooled Bus
list.

I've really enjoyed the nature of this list and I hate to see it split in some
ways, but I'll still be *on* the AirCooled list, I just won't be running it.
I believe that this will be the best good for the most people.

The plan is to split the list based on Joel's stats.  AirrCooled bus owners
will end up on the new list (called type2_at_primenet_dot_com), Watercooled owners
will stay on the Vanagon list.  If you have both, you'll be on both.  If you
are a WannaBus or Sniveling Unknown Lurker, then you will stay on the Vanagon
list.  This transformation will happen sometime in the next couple of days. 
We will be sharing more details soon. 

Please show Ken the respect and appreciation you have all shown me.

Thanks!
