&gt; Hi all,
&gt;         Just a quick question about where is the best place to hook up
&gt; the red wire from my aftermarket electric fuel pump so that it goes on
&gt; when the car is on.  It's going into a '73 bus with a 2.0l engine
&gt; (carburated).  Thanks.

Find the fuse that is on when the key is in the cranking and running 
position and hook it there.  Make sure the fuse is the right size and 
tap the wire close to the pump.  I don't know the electical schematics 
of that year off hand, but I think the best bet would be the ignition; 
then you could tap into the wire right at the engine.  Is this an 
auxillary pump, are you going to maintain the mechanical pump?  Is the 
engine a rebuilt 1.8 or something different?
