Well now that it's certain Joel has left his area ....

I'm on my way to that area and plan to view the facilities of the infamous
Monsta, Mayhem and Madcap Corp while there.

At any rate I'll not be back on the 'net' for a week so.

I hope you folks will be conservative about sending messages all over
the place.

Getting back to read a 'thousand messages does not seem like an
after-vacation fun thing!

Considering there's going to be a Friday AND a Monday during my absence ..
oh boy!!!

DON'T LOOK MARTHA!!!! (or was that supposed to be Ethel).
