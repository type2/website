Subject: Brakes Fixed...duh! *banging head*

hey now,

on thursday i posted that my brakes weren't working properly. i found the
problem. late wednesday a vaccum hose had come loose so i went ahead and
replaced it. there is a little round thingy-ma-jig (i think it's some kind of
air flow regulator) that i put on backwards in the dark. duh! it has an arrow
pointing towards the engine. so thursday when i crawled under the van i looked
at the hose again and saw this was on backwards. brakes are back and working
great!

went to the LEAF festival this weekend...it was great! camped with a bunch of
vws...big potluck on Saturday...met Stefan from the list...very kewl bus.......
love the compass he has mounted inside. Met folks from Beaufort, NC also!

hugs,

jonathan
