I wouldn't think that &quot;regular&quot; gas would be at the root of your problem.
I had another car that had a tank (or two) of bad gas, like water, or some
other contaminant mixed in, and the engine'd cut out, but it would always
restart from engine compression after a second or two...  Perhaps your
first tank of regular gas was really &quot;watered&quot; down...hmmm, that doesn't
explain the clock being off, though....

Oh, so I was going to say that I've always fed my EV regular unleaded
because,
uh, well, it's like a 21 gallon tank and at $1.40-$1.50 a gallon, it was,
like,
uh, going to be a bunch of bucks, yeah, that's it, it was going to be a bunch
of $$ !  Now, the wife's car ('91 GLI) gets nothing but Chevron 92,
regardless
of price.  BTW, my brand of choice for the EV is Shell 87, only because I
have
one of their wretched MC credit cards...

I hope the dealer does you right and you get your EV back soon!
