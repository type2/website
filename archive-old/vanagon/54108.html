&gt;&gt;When getting a price from the dealer for a rear seal (crankshaft pulley) I

&gt;&gt;that runs about $15. He had no explaination for the difference. Has anyone
&gt;&gt;had experience with this and could a regular seal be used.
&gt;&gt;This is a VW reman. engine, what are the odds that the PO (probably
&gt;&gt;unknowingly) installed a regular engine, can I tell from the engine number?
&gt;
&gt;This is a really good point, what IS the diff between Syncro and 2WD that
&gt;needs this kind of seal? Only thing I can think of is for Syncros deep water
&gt;fording, which would be pretty valid reason too!!  Anyone else?  Tim

Deep water is relative.  I don't think that you'd want go any deeper than
the bottom of the sliding door would you?  I have heard the same thing
about the Syncro engine though.
