Subject: RE: aftermarket seats

I would love to hear that there is a reasonably priced aftermarket seat
choice for Vanagon, but I recommend that you find a way to try before
you buy -- at least to the point of setting the Flofit seat the same
height off a showroom floor that the Vgon driver's seat is off the van
floor.  VW made the Vgon seats so uncomfortably short in the thigh for
a reason: the sharp angle at the knee compared to most cars.  I meant to
try Sami Dakhlia's Volvo seats when I saw his van, but forgot.  Other
replacement seats I've tried in Vgons were not only too tall for decent 
headroom, but so long in the thigh that they threatened to put your
calves and feet to sleep.  Sami -- how'd the Volvo seats go in, and how
are they?
