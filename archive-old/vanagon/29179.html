Subject: Re: The Value of Splits in Time

&gt;Splitters, Splitterettes and Speculators:
&gt;With some slight of finger, I offer the following ASCII
&gt;graph of the Condition 1 value of a 1967 Deluxe bus over the
&gt;last decade:
&gt;
&gt;1986 4,800
&gt;1987 *|
&gt;1988 **|
&gt;1989 *5,400
&gt;1990 ****\
&gt;1991 ******\
&gt;1992 *******7,600
&gt;1993 *************************\
&gt;1994 **************************************\
&gt;1995 *************************************************21,500
&gt;    4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22
&gt;                Thousands of US Dollars
&gt;
&gt;Did you REALLY want to know this?  Not sure I did.  When I
&gt;saw the post that ONE PIECE of green glass for the roof
&gt;windows of a deluxe was going for $125 and that it would
&gt;take $1,000 to replace them all (minus rubber of course) the
&gt;future of our *hobby* came into focus.  I have never been in
&gt;this for the money but you have to know there ARE people who
&gt;are.  There are also people who have finally realized what
&gt;we knew several decades ago but they now have the money and
&gt;desire to pay for what they once considered to be junk.

Expect to see the same phenomenon happening with the 2nd-series Bus as time
goes on, too. (Though I notice that the two major VW-collector magazines
rarely feature the post-'68 Buses and I've never seen one on the cover. . .!)
