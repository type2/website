Subject: Re: how does this sound???

&gt;
&gt;In my search for newer brick to replace the '82 westy diesel,I came 
&gt;across one:  
&gt;
&gt;'91  Westy
&gt;123,000 miles, NO A/C
&gt;
&gt;they're asking approximately $5,900.00 ...
&gt;
&gt;sounds like a good deal, but...
&gt;how much would it cost me to put A/C in it?
&gt;when would the engine need rebuilding, and how much would it cost me?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I'll appreciate any ides, insigths, etc...
&gt;Thanks,

This strikes me as a MAJOR bargain, since those beasts go for $17-20,000CDN 
up here in the far North. Get a friendly good VW garage to look it over, and 
fast. You have a lot of headroom for repairs at that price. The recent 
thread on Synchro rebuild tells it all, but a 1991 with 123K miles has spent 
a lot of time on the highway, nice and easy on the running gear usually. If 
it drips antifreeze from the heads it's going to cost you however. The 
exhaust system may be cooked, 123K miles is a lot of heat! And if you're not 
buying, send me the phone #. asap! I can live without A/C!   tim s.
