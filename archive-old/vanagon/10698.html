I'm new to the news group.  Please, some advice/opinions. 

I am thinking about buying a vw camper.  A friend just bought an '81, but
his wife hates it; no heat.  He bought it because (1) they're cheaper than
water cooled, and (2) he heard bad things about head failure in the water
cooled.  I'm leaning towards a late 80s, perhaps a weekender rather than a
camper.  My wife wants the extra seats for kids, and a poptop.  Is the
syncro good, reliable, maintainable? 

What should I look for and definitely avoid?
