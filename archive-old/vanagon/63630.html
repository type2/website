&gt; 
&gt; Remember the 'Porsche' 914 with the VW Vanagon engine ? - &amp; the VW dealers
&gt; would then have the audacity to tell prospective buyers that they were
&gt; getting a Porsche engine in the Vanagon (made me want to puke).

-    Well, at least the heads of a 2liter 914 were only particular to 
914's only. Porsche must have requested a redesign.
