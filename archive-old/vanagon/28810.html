Having had nothing but bad experiences with J.C. Whitney, I have to
suggest finding an alternate source.  Admittedly, they're usually the
cheapest option, but you get what you pay for.

As one suggestion, Rocky Mountain Motor Works has new heater boxes for
$104.49 each.  I ordered two sets (four boxes) today, so that the
interiors of both my busi will be A) warm, and B) CO free.  Hopefully
this means I won't be getting a headache within a few minutes of
starting to drive any more.

And yes, I realize that sometimes, the difference from $75 to $105 is
more than is reasonable, no matter what the quality difference....
