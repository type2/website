Hi list Volks,

Marc Magee and Randy Newell are perfectly allright - the 4x4 Mercedes Van is 
pretty expensive, because the conversion is beeing done aftermarket not at VW 
/ MB. (Iglhaut GmbH, Wuerzburg, Germany). So a James Cook Camper 4x4 as shown 
will be about 120 000 DM. 

But as you know from the customer survey about 4x4 already mentioned on the 
list a few weeks before, VW is thinking about a new off-road vehicle too.

Last week brought some clarification about that project: AUDI are planning on 
an off-road version. It looks like something in between A6 Avant quattro and a 
Jeep Cherokee. They say that it has not been finally decided if it will go 
into production (survey !!) but if so it would be available in late 1999 with 
the new V6 TDI or a V6 gas or even the V8 from the A8. They estimate figures 
of some 10 000 a year and see market chances especially in the US market (!!) 
and in alpine countries. 

This is good news because according to the platform strategy the next 
Transporter - which is due to be presented by the turn of the millenium - will 
probably share drivetrain componenets and engines with the AUDI A4 / A6. Just 
like the first VW Buses did with the beetle and the Eurovan does with the last 
Passat models. So probability is high that it will no longer have a 
transversal engine but a longitudinal one (tech. term ??). So there might be a 
nice combination between the A6 4x4 componenets and a future Transporter.

All we have to do is demand it :-) (And hope for the best)

Comments on the customer survey were forwarded to the VW customer mag - who 
were very astonished to recive letters from the US, Canada and Australia.
