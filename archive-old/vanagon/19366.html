To All:

Trying to re-enter the US on a Sunday evening at the Tijuana border crossing
can take up to four hours ( early Monday isn't much better).  Wednesdays are
good.  

(For feefty dolla' I know a fellow he can get us all across the border and
our buses too with no waiting.  But you gotta have good tires &amp; four-wheel
drive :-)
