It was never decided hands down about anything Tom.  Where did you get that
idea?  Just because it was on a &quot;FAQ&quot; on a web page?  It's always been hotly
contested and there are lots of opinions. Just because someone puts it on a
pretty page doesn't mean it's a fact.  


&gt; Any other opinions out there?
Lots.
