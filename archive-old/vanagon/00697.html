Subject: Replacing Coolant... Tips Anyone? 
Date: Tue, 3 May 94 11:04:32 PDT

Forwarded message:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I'm going to replace my coolant soon, and although I've read the 
&gt; Bentley description of this little chore, I was hoping some netters
&gt; who have already done this could offer some tips or gotcha's.
&gt; 
&gt; I remember reading one poster describing the process as being 
&gt; &quot;black magic&quot;.  I've got three bottles of the VW anti-freeze, and
&gt; will be out searching for distilled water again.  Is it just California,
&gt; or is distilled water no longer sold at Kmart?  All they have have is
&gt; mineral water.
&gt; 
&gt; If there's any good tips out there, maybe they should be added to 
&gt; that ever-expanding &quot;faq&quot; that exists somewhere near Joel.
&gt; 
&gt; 

I'd also like tips on this also.  I am a little leary about doing this
after reading about how tough it is to get the air out of the system.

Thanks,
