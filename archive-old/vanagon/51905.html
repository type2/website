&gt; - Greg Daughtry -
           It's easy- remove the electrical connection from the
   sensor. Measure with an Ohm meter the resistance. At a given
   temperature you should measure specific Temps.
                       temp.      Ohms
                         212      200
                         194      250
                         176      300
                         158      400
                         140      600
                         122      775
                         104      1050
                         86       1500
                         68       2500
                         50       3500
                         32       5500

    Measure cold. and check to air temp. Run the engine for 15 min.
    and check again. I should be in the 775 ohm to 200 ohm range. I
    found that it will run well even if its off by 300 ohms.
