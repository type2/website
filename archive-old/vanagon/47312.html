Peter:
This EXACT symptom occurred to my 86 Transporter about a year ago. After
I tore down the trans axle and pressed off the gears from the main shaft
did I find the Synchronizer hub for 3rd/4th had broken.MAJOR pain in the
gazotska.Requires a special tool to get into the gear box,luckily I was
in good with the service manager who let me borrow it.
(onecaseofbeerfortheshopreward).
 email me for more details.
