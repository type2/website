&gt;  Cutting made little broken bits on the edges, (which were not exactly
&gt;straight anyway, so i sanded with a  piece of 2x4 wrapped in sandpaper).
&gt;  This happened whether i had the wood good side up or good side down, so go
&gt;fiure.  Id cut it a little bigger, and sand it down next time..

I think it's cool putting the wood in the cab doors, I'm gonna do that, too.

Re the chipping, next time get some heavy, sticky brand-name masking tape
and stick it around the perimeter you're going to cut. Then burnish it
(with a burnisher--whodah thought?--graphic arts store or art supply store,
about two dollars. It's a little hard roller with a handle) to stick it
down very tight.

If you use a new, fine-toothed blade and go slow, it won't chip at all.
