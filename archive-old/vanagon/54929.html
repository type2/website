&gt; &gt;Concerning the engine lid though, all later models (87+) I've seen came wth
&gt; &gt;the plastic lid, while and 82 diesel's I saw came with the heavy metal lid.
&gt; &gt; I think VW changed over sometime between 82 &amp; 86 from metal to plastic on
&gt; &gt;all the lids.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Does anyone know when this change was made?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm fairly sure that my '90 has a metal lid.
