Subject: Re: Vanagon H20 cruising speed

In a message dated 96-05-02 18:56:05 EDT, you write:

&gt;That was an informative reply to the question about reasonable cruising 
&gt;speed in an air cooled vanagon.  Could you share some thoughts with the 
&gt;list about reasonable speeds for the water cooled crowd?  
&gt;
&gt; I've adopted the magic number of 62 mph as a 
&gt;zero-headwind cruise speed, with a downshift to 3rd (and drop to 50 mph) 
&gt;when I can't hold speed on a grade with less than 3/4 throttle.  This 
&gt;&quot;feels&quot; safe for the engine, if feelings count for anything, but I'd be 
&gt;curious as to your (and other's) opinion as to where the danger zones 
&gt;start (in terms of rpm and engine load) for the wasserboxer.
&gt;

Many thanks for your compliment Ed.

As far as I know, the watercooled vans have no speed limitations (besides the
obvious) like those of the aircooled motors.  The only problem that I know of
is the obvious problem of trying to bail coolant back into the Wasserboxer's
cooling system fast enough to keep it going down the road. ;-)  That is
purely a corrosion problem, though.  Leaking heads aside, I think that the
use of synthetic oil and a good thermostatically opened oil cooler would
allow Wasserboxers to be driven at a speed of 75 MPH before significant wear
started to occur.  The jugs are completely surrounded by coolant.  The
coolant affords an excellent heat sink transferring the heat to the air at
whatever rate the stock motor could require.  The only wear factor is the
steady directional wear of the rings from constantly pushing that huge nose
through the wind at high speeds.  Naturally, very high speeds (pushing wind)
will wear any motor at an increased rate.  I would say 75 MPH in WIND SPEED
is a safe brisk cruising speed with the Wasserboxer.  That means that with a
20 MPH headwind that speed is 55 MPH and vice-versa if you can afford the
extra points.

The Wasserboxer can be charged up a hill in top gear without downshifting
(with premium fuel) as long as speed can be maintained  You should not worry
about increased wear under these conditions.
