I live in a similar neighborhood. Call it the neighborhood of fine 
rides.  Not only are scrillion watt systems cool, the coolest thing is to 
put small diameter superwide wheels on your shitbox.  The trick is they 
have to be offset totally out of the wheel wells to clear the brakes.  
This treatment really adds a touch of class to any nissan sentra !
