Subject: Re: Rusty Coolant and PS pipes on '85

Biggest problem with repalcing the power steering lines is the need to drop
the fuel tank.  The lines are meteric and are a bear to get in the proper
diameter.  The dealer gets ridiculous money for these things.  If time
permits, find a set of lines at junkie.  Return line can be replaced with
short sections of hose as needed.  In fact there is a hose splice from the
factory.  The plastic lines from the later years are a different diameter so
some hoses will need replacing.  Although they don't rust, the ends split off
and the do crack unexpectedly.  I do not know what is worse, a small rust
leak, or dumping the coolant all at once.  Another money saving idea gets us
again.
Dennis.
