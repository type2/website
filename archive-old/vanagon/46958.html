Subject: Westphalia Dormatic fridge and sink bowl trouble

I've owned my 81 VW Westphalia for 11 years and have taken it from Yukon
Territory to Matzatlan Mex.  For the first time my propane mode fridg won't
remain operational during the night and the sink drain plastic housing to
hose has broken making it kaput for use.  Any advise on repair of both would
be appreciated.  Found a RV center who will for $150 service Dormatic fridge.
 thanks

Chris from Calif
