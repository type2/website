Subject:       Re: clattering scare

Gerry says:
 there was this quite pronounced knocking. 
It sounded serious and continued the 4 or so miles to the library and
back.  I was pretty sad and scared.  Then, as I idled it, it started to
clear up.

On my '85, the lifters, well actually it seems to be just one, will 
occassionally 
clatter on start-up and disappear (the noise, not the lifter!) upon 
warmup.  It's definately a CLACK CLACK CLACK, deeper than tick tick 
tick but certainly not KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.  (Gawd, I love these 
descriptions!)  The only thing that went KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK that I 
just KNEW was my engine self-destructing was when the water-pump went 
out.  This sound however did not go away until I did the dirty deed.  

BTW, I bought a NAPA rebuilt to save a few bucks and was very 
disgusted with the unit.  Poor quality castings, rough o-ring 
channel, bolt holes not the stock depth and juuussst a little off of 
alignment of where they should be.  I should of returned it but I put 
it on, anyway.

You may want to try one of the miracle lifter cleaners you add to the 
crankcase oil.  They work but I question their effect on our fragile 
seals.  Maybe that 'Rislone' product is safer, I've used it several 
times and it isn't quite as strong of an organic solvent (seems to be 
more of a detergent than a solventf) but I felt better.  That's what 
we're really buying with all those automotive chemicals anyway, 
right?  Something so WE feel better.

Someone once suggested using ATF fluid as a crankcase cleaner...  
could that person elaborate?  Did it work?  One quart per 4?
