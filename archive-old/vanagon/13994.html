Well,

	I've been slaving over the nose of my bus, hammering out everything 
as much as I could, and then sussing it up with some filler here and there.
	
	I thought it was looking pretty good, so I sanded it all down and 
put on some surfacer/sealer last night.  Egads!  this stuff shows each
and every flaw in astonishing detail!

	Looks like I have some some work to do!  A few high spots to beat down,
several low spots to bring up, and a lot of sanding!

	I haven't done the guide-coat trick yet - I'll hold off on that until
I'm in the finishing stages and I have all of the bits (lights, windows,
etc) removed.

	( the guide coat trick is where you spray on a contrasting color, and
then sand it down.  The low spots will show up because the paint won't
be sanded off.  )

Thom
