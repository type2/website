Subject: FS 1988 GL Westfalia camper

I am selling my 1988 VW camper I have used only infrequently over the 8 years
I have had it, and will entertain reasonable offers (In Colorado recently 
a dealer said I might start at $14,999, but that was Colorado, and seems very
high for Maryland.) It is a very clean vehicle, and I bought it new in 1989. 

Specifics: 

Camper location: Glyndon, Maryland (20 mi north of Baltimore, MD)

1988 GL (NOT a snchro) Westfalia Camper with all standard camper gear: 

63,000 original miles. Water-cooled. Cruise control. Heated mirrors. A/C that
really works. Automatic Transmission. Rear heater with fan. New exhaust
system (complete). New heads (the infamous coolant gasket deterioration
problem...)

Camping gear: Dometic refrig., stove (both propane), sink, water tank, water
pump (needs new pump), cabinets, pop-top with dbl bed, 2 tables. Good canvas.
Small hole (1&quot;) in mosquito netting (easily repaired.)
