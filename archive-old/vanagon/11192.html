Subject:       Re: Parts cleaners



&gt; &gt; I use paint thinner. I have many reasons to use the stuff, like it's 
&gt; &gt; cheap($1.60/gal),  dries to leave a totally clean, not greasy at all 
&gt; &gt; surface.  
&gt; 
&gt; I have found that Acetone, while slightly more expensive than paint thinner,
&gt; works even better!

Isn't acetone bad for your liver? You can inhale and absorb 
significant amounts through your skin. Nasty stuff.  :-P
