Subject: Re: Bentley Manuals Cheap / Vanagon Roof Vent
Date: Mon, 14 Jul 1997 19:57:25 -0400


&gt; For those of you that have not yet purchased (or inherited) a Bentley
&gt; manual for your Vanagon yet (it's THE factory service manual for all
&gt; model years of the Vanagon), you can order one from Barnes &amp; Noble off
&gt; their web page. My VW dealership wanted $95 for this, B &amp; N charged me
&gt; $67.96 plus $7.95 to ship it second day air (less $ if you can wait) and
&gt; no tax :-) Check it out. 
&gt; 
&gt;Anyone know where to get after-market replacement sunroofs for a
&gt;Westfalia. This is the squareish grey plastic roof on hinges that screws
&gt;up to let air in. Mine is disintegrating and the dealer wants $240 for a
&gt;new one!!! Has anyone tried using RV parts up there?

I have been offering Bentley manuals to the List for $62.95 for about a
year now (plus $5.50 postage), still the lowest price going.  Also, I have
original replacement roof vents for $119.95 each with List Member discount.
 Admittedly a pretty pricy piece of plastic (say that three times fast :-),
but there is no aftermarket replacement that matches the dimensions, and at
least it beats $240...
