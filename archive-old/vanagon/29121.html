Subject: heater tube


&gt;&gt;&gt;And David Preston thus wrote:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; While in the process of installing an in-line blower in my 1972 Pop-Top, I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; managed to break off the entire tube (the tube that runs from the junction
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the heat exchangers and the front of the van).  It was a litttle more rusty
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than I expected.  Any thought on fixing this?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;We put a piece of PVC pipe in my friend's '59. Works a treat - he never
&gt;&gt;&gt;realized he could have that much heat!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Is PVC acceptible for this application in terms of vapors it may give off
&gt;&gt;when heated?  It's really convenient to use, but I'd like to be sure of the
&gt;&gt;safety factor first.  In any event it might be safer than the original
&gt;&gt;rusted out pipe with asbestos fibers leaking in from the gaskets/insulation.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;my friend used a stove pipe and then wrapped it in insulation. looks OEM!!
