Subject:       Vanagon coolant leakage

Import Service, March '90  Vol3, No 3

&quot;A damaged plastic coolant return flange located at the rear of the 
right cylinder head can cause coolant leakage on 86-88 models.  The 
plastic flange is close to the engine's drive belts and can be 
damaged by a loose or broken belt.  Engine orverheating can also warp 
the sealing surface of the flange, causing coolant leakage and more 
overheating.

To correct (or avoid) these problems, replace the damaged plastic 
flange with a metal coolant return flange, P/N 025 121 160 D, and 
gasket P/N N 901 685 01.&quot;
