Subject: Feeling like Charles Kuralt (friday)

Inpursuit of going totally nuts I am trying to kick the Tobacco/caffeine
&quot;jones.&quot; After nearly a WHOLE week w/o (big deal)  I woke up this AM feeling
like the road that Charles Kuralt has been riding for all of these years. I
had a postal moment wondering why smoking and bad breath are bad for you and
starting your day at 05:00 and running five miles is supposedly &quot;good&quot; for
you. 10:30AM, Captian Kangaroo, and a Budweiser/Marlboro breakfast woulda
been much better this AM.
(I think I'll give up whining for Lent...) ;)
