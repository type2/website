Subject: Re: Does JCW sell exhaust for '84 Vanagon?

Ric rote:
&gt;Would someone who has a JCW catalog handy check and see if they carry exhaust
&gt;systems for the '84 Vanagons.

Yep, on page 26 of the JCW Volksie catalog you can get an '83 - '85 muffler
and tailpipe. Go to the JCW web page and you can order their VW catalog
free. Or call 321-431-6102 (I have no connection to this, or any other company.)
