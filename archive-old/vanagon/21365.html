    Subject: *URGENT*  Regarding Olga
    Date: Fri, 21 Jul

    
    I've been poking around a bit, trying to track down the account 
    responsible for the Olga posts.
    
    Mark Jurras was able to dredge up an old copy of the first post, 
    that actually had the account name...thanks, Mark!...and I'm in 
    touch with the postmaster there.  Naturally, it's an anonymous 
    account, in fact it looks like a hacked account rather than a 
    freely granted anonymous account.
    
    I want a full electronic copy, including headers, of the message 
    that hit the list server. I've saved *my* copy, but it only has  
    headers of the e-mail message the list server sent me.
    
    And I haven't saved any information about who runs majordomo
    at datsun-roadsters_at_triumph.cs.utah_dot_edu!
    
    In fact, I seem to recall that the guy in charge said he's 
    leaving town for a week or two! Making it pretty hard to get 
    him to look in the next few hours, in case he archives for a 
    day or two!
    
    Anybody know who I might contact, or how I might get at it?
    Any help appreciated!
