&gt;DOPPLEKABINE the German name for Double-Cab Pickup Truck.
&gt;DOUBLE-CAB  the VW Pickup Truck characterized by seating for six and
&gt;            three doors. a 1/2-ton vehicle.

&gt;PICKUP      a model of bus that had a flat load bed with no fixed roof
&gt;            over the rear half of the vehicle. see Single-Cab and
&gt;            Double-Cab. also called Pritschenwagen. an optional canvas
&gt;            cover for the rear flat bed was available.

&gt;SINGLE-CAB  the 3/4-ton version of the VW Pickup Truck. seating for
&gt;            three people.

Single Cabs are also known as Pritschenwagens. Don't know if that applies
to doubles, too.

This is based on the ads I've seen from the early 50's. The one in
particular I'm thinking of has a very early Single Cab P-wagen in green
with a couple of guys loading it. Surrounding that picture are other
depictions of various tradesmen.
