Subject: Interstate battery charging question.

Fawning over my recent purchase, i realized i don't know what 'type' 
my new battery is.  I have an Interstate MT-41.  is this:

1- a 'conventional' battery?
2- a 'low maintenance' battery?
3- a 'maintenance free' battery?

I'm trying to figure out which final charging voltage to run my 
charger at.  It has a 2 position switch for conventional/low 
maintenance/gel and then a position for maint. free/deep cycle.  The 
final charging voltage on the maint. free setting is higher than the 
conventional position.

The charger tops out at 14.5v on the conventional setting and then 
goes into the float mode to keep it topped up but not overcharge.  
this is the setting i use, and i believe is right.  BUT if someone 
has some literature that could confirm this i'd be tickled.
