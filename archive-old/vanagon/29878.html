Howdy All!

Glad to have found this group. My first car was a '69 Transporter. Ripped 
out the seats, built a bed in back, drove from NY to California. Ahhh, 
the memories.

Now I've got a family and want to buy a camper model for skiing and 
climbing trips. But I can't stand the thought of another winter road trip 
with no heat, so it's got to be a water boxer. I'm thinkin' around '85. 
Should be clean too. I'm not really interested in a &quot;project&quot; ;)
