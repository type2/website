     So...
     
     Who's correct.
     
     Gerry says it has phosphate; Mark says it's phosphate-free.

&gt; my '84 Westy, including  the flush product and the hydrometer (?) used to
&gt; test, and to date, after about about six months, I've had no evidence of
&gt; any deterioration. If you are still concerned about rust and corrosion
&gt; inhibition,  ask her for a source for comparative data and information,
&gt; which I assume she has available.

But it's NOT Phosphate Free.
