&gt;How do I recognize possible &quot;arcing of spark plug wires?&quot; I read something
&gt;about it on the purchased box when I replaced my plug wires, but it
&gt;still quite didn't get through to me.

well ... i always just go look in the engine compartment, with the engine
running, at night. in the dark. no flashlight. :)

no, really, that's how i've done it ever since some idiot (who shall remain
brotherless!) told me, &quot;just grab hold of the wires ... it won't hurt you!&quot;
ohyezzzz ... if they're arcing, you might be sparking, when you grab. ;)

but if you look on a dark and stormy night, you will see little blue
lightninganing on the wires.
