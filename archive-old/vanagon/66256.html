Subject:      Wheels...Again

Hey You All,
        I,m really having problems finding 15&quot; wheels that will fit my '91
vanagon. The Tire Rack says that the only wheels they have that will fit
are the Borbet Replica II's. I know that there must be other wheels for
this car, but their database only has cross-reference information no
specifics about offset, center bore dia. etc. I have seen so much wheel
info on the List in the past  and have loked at much of it again, but to no
avail. Can anyone out there give me the real poop? Mabye someone can
sugggest specfic wheels that will fit.
Thans
Dave
