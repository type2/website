&gt;The manual shows a socket-on-extension easily reaching between the push-rod
&gt;tubes to drain the fluid from the heads.  I found only sheet-metal covers
&gt;preventing any access to this region.  They were bolted to the bottom of
&gt;the case (much like on an air-cooled engine) and also had tabs that were
&gt;under the bottom exhaust port stud nut (and I sure didn't want to open
&gt;another can of worms by altering the exhaust system's integrity).  Are
&gt;these not-indicated-in-Bentley dirt shields common or weird?

that's the normal sheet metal shields for the push rod tubes, just like on
the air cooled. and, yes, you have to undo the nuts on the exhaust studs to
take them off. it's not THAT bad and the exhaust doesn't move about. but DO
use some penetrant oil. it helps.
