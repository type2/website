Subject: 12th Annual Vintage Volkswagen Weekend

Here's a chance for a mid-west get together!

WHAT:  See the subject line. I'm not going to set here and retype that thing
all over again.  Oh, I've already typed more than if I'd have just put 12th
Annual Vintage Volkswagen Weekend.  Oh well ;-)

Where:  J.A.C. Auto Repair &amp; Service, 6336 Highway 10, Anoka, Minnesota.
 Just northwest of Minneapolis.

WHEN:  19 &amp; 20 August 1995

This is an air cooled show, but ALL aircooleds are welcome.  Hopefully mine
will be back on the road and under its own power by then.

For more details call 612-421-2705.
