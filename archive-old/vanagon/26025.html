Subject: Heater cable connects to valve... how?

I have finally decided to fix the heater cable connection to the coolant
valve on my '85 GL.  I have a coolant leak in the plastic &quot;T&quot; piece next to
the overflow tank in the engine compartment so I wanted to order both parts
from Ellis at the same time.  Surprisingly, this plastic &quot;T&quot; piece was only
$10, I can't be surprised at how expensive parts for this car are, but I was
surprised that this part was so cheap.

But I digress.  The fiche does not show the clip that connects the cable to
the heater control valve--it does show a clip that fits the cable to a lever
under the dash.  They sold me this clip and said the piece works on both
ends.  I can't figure out how this works, can anyone explain?  It's not cold
here yet (Atlanta) but it is just around the corner (not meaning to make the
Minnesotans on the list laugh too hard).  I'm not sure that this piece is
the correct clip for the job.
