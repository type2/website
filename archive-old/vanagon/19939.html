Subject: Refurbishing Pop top (Martha)

I tried sending this direct, but it kept bouncing.  The good news is, it's
bus related.

Martha,

I was just catching up on the digests since I've been away and saw your
posting on sealing your top.  This is a topic I'm very interested in since
my top is showing its age (71) and I'm about to install a new top seal.  I
have a few questions if you don't mind:  What was the quote for gel coating?
(Just curiosity, something tells me I can't afford it anyway)  Did the Kool
Seal paint leave brush marks or does it smooth out as it dries? Does it ever
harden, and/or how elastic does it stay?

If this stuff works well it sounds like $30 is a real bargain!

Thanks!
Ron
