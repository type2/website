Dan,

I used 'Ultra-copper' on a lot of engines and liked it, except for the latex
base.  As a sealant it was better than Permatex since it formed a thinner
seal, but as an assembly component I didn't like the way it would sometimes
peel off the case due to an accidental touch.  Permatex would smear but there
was always some left.  I started using the Loctite stuff because it not only
formed the thinnest seal I'd ever seen (thinner is better when there's no
gasket), it was at least as tenacious as Permatex; you didn't have to worry
that an accidental touch would force you to clean &amp; recoat the parting line.

But as I recall, the thinner for both Permatex and Ultra-copper was something
so potent it made boy-mechanics have two-headed motorcycles.  I wouldn't put
Loctite on a bagle but otherwise it's fairly benign; Hypolon has some
trichloroethane, the other compounds are mostly silicones.

One note of caution, and the reason I've made this a general posting:  If
you've got to fix it and drive on, USE PERMATEX.  But if you're building
engines in the privacy of your own bedroom, with lots of time between
assembly and test-running -- at least 8 hours (more is better) -- then use
the newer sealants.  The have a required CURE TIME.  The only guys I know who
don't like them are the types who never read labels; don't give them a chance
to do their job.

If you think about it, outfits like the Loctite Corporations are to be
numbered among the Good Guys, white hats and all.  They'll never tell you red
cars or faster, or waste your time expounding on the virtues of 500 watt
stereo systems in a bug.  The value of what they sell is obvious.  And if
you've got some sexy sealing problem, they'll usually offer some free advice
on what might work. (This is mebbe a sermonette but I won't call it that.)

ps -  I use gasgacinch for some things.  I also use lots of plain old
fashioned Indean Head gasket shellac.  Sometimes the cheapest thing is good
enough.
