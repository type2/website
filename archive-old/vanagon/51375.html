&gt;&gt;The glow plug light on my '82 Diesel Westy (35K) comes on to show that it

&gt;
&gt;        There is a Temperature sender in the engine (I think that it is on
&gt;the head) that goes to the glow plug control relay.  Where on the west coast
&gt;are you? it may just not be cold enough for it to stay on for long.  Does
&gt;the van start OK?
&gt;
&gt;        My light didn't stay on for long above 50F back when I had a
&gt;controll relay(that was before the fire).
&gt;
The glow plug relay controls how long the glow plugs are active.  Thru the
'70's, there were slow glow plugs and relays.  Gradually Bosch changed to
fast glow plugs and relays.  There is no correlation between the engine
temperature, the air temperature and the length of time the led stays on.
