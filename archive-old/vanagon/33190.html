My children think it's funny that their dad has names for all the VWs.  I 
will admit it's out of character.

So the family is:
Opie - '68 crewcab pickup
Beatrice - '73 Campmobile
Rusty - '68 window bus

What's even more interesting is how the name reflects the character of the 
vehicle (or is it my imagination), like Thom's Tetnaus.  Opie's kind of a 
good old boy, Beatrice seems to be a formal, old and friendly feminine type, 
and Rusty is just a happy guy, not too hung up on appearances.

Boy, does all this sound silly.
