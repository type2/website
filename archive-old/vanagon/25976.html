Subject:       re:heating ideas

one more thought.
    This actually works.  as a kid, I discovered on a winter campout 
that by lighting the tips of my shoes on fire, it kept my feet plenty 
warm.  the rubber burns slowly and radiates a lot of heat. needless 
to say, my parents werent any too happy.  Reboks work best.
   strange kids make even stranger adults.
   
    I think i'll go now.
