Subject: Re: Insulation?

Well, now, I just had to get a `64 bus *crushed* because of this.....
the insulation gathered water, and toasted all the panels (RUST! ROT!
DOOOOMMM!!!!) But it might work, if you inspected now and then....
Mabey someone else has a different viewpoint.

&gt; I recently went to a VW junkyard looking for parts and found a bus that 
&gt; had the inner panels removed and appeared to have house insulation 
&gt; between the outer wall and the inner panelling. Anybody ever heard 
&gt; of/tried this? Being in Seattle, I'm looking for any way to stay warmer 
&gt; this winter.
