Subject: Distributor clamp bolt
Date: Wed, 6 Sep 1995 09:32:51 -0500 (CDT)

On my new engine I installed just about new everything.  One new thing
was the dist clamp.  The bolt running through it from the back was 
tack welded to the clamp somehow.  Last night I managed to break that 
weld loose.  I got it going with the use of a couple of lock washers 
and a hose clamp.  Don't laugh.  I would however, like a more 
permanent solution.  I guess I could pull the thing off and take to 
the local welding shop.  Anybody know of a quicker way using the right
combination of washers or something?  I am loath to start pulling my 
dist and such out again.  Come to think of it, maybe I should.  Jim
