Martha Rubin coughed up:
&gt; 
&gt; ...................................  That some stupid racoons happened to 
&gt; traipse thru these cheesecakes during the nite is a commentary on how 
&gt; wonderfully resilient and strong they were.  ,............................... 
Which?  The cheesecake or the 'coons?  Those musta been some tuff 'coons...

I also noticed that there was no mention of the borscht.  Any reason?

&quot;Don't accept borscht from a woman who is eating chicken&quot;  :)
