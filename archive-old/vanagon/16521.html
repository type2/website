&gt; I'm missing what I believe is a &quot;sink cabinet&quot; assembly for my 71 which is 
&gt; supposed to go right behind the fron passenger (U.S. :-)) seat - am I correct 
&gt;and does anyone have advice on how I'd go about finding one?  Anyone seen them 
&gt; anywhere, other than the obvious luck of stumbling onto one at a junkyard 

I wouldn't bother if I were you.  In the seven years I have been camping
in my 73, that space behind the passenger seat has become very dear to me,
and I just recently ripped out the stove-fridge unit that was there and
moved it to the other side of the camper (behind the driver).  I am sick
and tired of having the entrance to the sliding door blocked.  Of course,
if you are trying to restore the camper to original, then disregard all of
the above.  :)

I have seen lots of those units in the junkyards over the years - if you
check them often you will find one eventually.  Be persistant!
