Subject: Re: &quot;Roadkill&quot; sound proofing

Heh, I wanted to find the other one to see the RvB Vanagon... the 
Roadkill ad is opposite page 78, look for the lurid magenta/black 
Photoshop &quot;noise&quot; effect (and the crappy typography). Sounds like an 
intresting product, if it works. The ad says &quot;consumer inquiries: 813 572 
9255&quot;.

&gt; Does anyone have the phone # or address where I could speak/write
