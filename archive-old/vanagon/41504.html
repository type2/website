Subject: Orcas Island vw survey

This weekend I went camping on Orcas Island, ' jewel of the San Juans', with
a couple friends.    Saturday Jan, Irene, &amp; I drove from Olympia to Anacortes
in Bugster (goes faster :)).  It has a  roofrack.  Amazing the amount of
stuff we put in it.  With three people and stuff, including a pack on the
rack it topped out at 83mph.   :)  The motor (1600SP) has over 100,000 miles
on it, so I'm not complaing    (knock on wood).   On the way, we counted vws.
 saw one split screen, a green and white 21 window, I think around Tacoma.

We took the ferry to Orcas and hitched around the island.   We had way too
much stuff.  It was a great weekend for it, sunny and warm.   People were
really friendly.  There are only 3500 year round residents on Orcas, so they
must like someone new to talk to.   We  were going to go to Doe Bay, but
ended up with the best campsite at Moran State Park, next to the lake, in the
sun.    Saw  lots of bugs and buses on the island, but only one split, a late
'60 (would have come with a 40hp motor, had the shifter in the forward place)
blue double doors both sides Riveria camper.  It was nice, the guy had bought
it from a friend whose family had it for 22 years.

      Unfortunately, the next campsite had a dozen small boys, but i think we
out rowdied them.   Jan kept feeding the local bunny, and a racoon visted
too.   We made a campfire and cooked stuff.  The yams got burnt.   I wish we
hadn't pitched the tent on those tree roots.  The boys stole out marshmallows
while we slept. 

In the morning we went into town.    But first we visited  Rosario,  Robert
Moran's mansion that is now a resort.  It's a pretty interesting place, but
isn't that a terrible name?  Anyway. they have a swimming pool inside, with
old tiles on the floors mosaic style, and windows looking out over the water,
and a sauna, and a big pipe organ, and all kinds of nifty stuff. In Eastsound
 Jan's search for a cheesy touristy ashtray was fruitless.   They sell shot
glasses, though.   Then we went to the top of Mount Constitution, which has a
tower from which there are great views.  The islands look like lumps in the
water, with green all over them.  It was neat.   They were all  made by
glaciers.

Went back to the campsit for our stuff, and to toast the island, etc. with
the last of the beer.   Finally got out of there (we did have the best
campsite.  It was beautiful.  The lake was on three sides.)  and got a ride
in a pick up to the ferry terminal.  Flatbedding is fun, makes me want to get
a single or double cab.  The ferry dropped us in Anacortes about 10:00
Sunday.  Back to Oly!   Saw one split on the way back, an 63 or earlier one
in Mount Vernon.   i didn't get a good look.

MORE VW CONTENT:   The  survey results were 3 split window buses, 29
baywindow buses,  and 27 beetles.    This was mostly on the way  north, and
on Orcas.  we didn't count Olympia VWs, and it was too dark on the way back
to see much.   Wierd to see more buses than bugs, i thought .   Anyway, it
was a great trip, and the first time i had  tent camped in ages.    Thinking
about going to Vancouver Island in a couple weeks,  to trade Jan's two
fastbacks for a 63 beetle.   The guy supposedly has a parts barndoor bus,
too.
