Subject: westy canvas

I need a replacement canvas (one or three window) for an '85 Westfalia.

I'm working on an '85 Westfalia that has been sitting for nearly two 
years. Aside from the typical mechanical problems, which are in 
remarkably good condition, I've spent a tremendous amount of time 
repairing mouse damage. It is absolutely amazing the destruction that 
mice can do to an automobile! 

This van must have been a five-star mouse hotel. They stripped the 
insulation from the front ceiling and dragged it, via fresh air ducts and 
under the pop-top, to the rear and into the AC compartment and the 
canvas. The AC blower was packed with insulation and mouse crap, and the 
entire van smells horrible. The canvas now has about a half-dozen fist 
sized holes, including some through the front screen and zipper.

I've managed to strip the entire van, clean the miles of duct work, and 
deoderize as much as I can. However, the canvas is beyond repair. Does 
anyone know where I can get a new canvas? I found a canvas in a JC 
Whitney catalog (I've never bought anything from their though) for $350. 
Is this good? Are these quality canvases?

Thanx for the help!

Michael K.
