Subject: Re: Need ref# for KYB shocks for breadloaf

Sami (&amp; Info to V_at_L &quot;Volks&quot;) -
68-79 Breadloafs do have different KYB numbers front &amp; rear

Gas-A-Just Shocks - Heaviest Duty
KYB KG4521 Front Gas-A-Just  (Our ZAP-41311 BBI Price 34.95ea)
KYB KG5530 Rear Gas-A-Just (Our ZAP-51312 BBI Price 34.95ea)

Gas Rider 2 (GR2) - Softer Gas Ride
KYB 343144 Front GR2 (Our ZAP-41321  BBI Price 29.95ea)
KYB 344045 Rear GR2 (Our ZAP-51321 BBI Price 33.95ea) *See Note*

Note:  Rear Shock 344045 Requires KYB #107 Bushing Kit to mount properly with
stock 12mm Bolt - we make and supply the correct bushing along with the 12mm
flat washer required - KYB's kit supplies all kinds of different bushings,
along with the correct ones needed - you'll throw away 3/4 of this kit
provided.  KYB almost charges 9 bucks for this kit (kit does both sides) - we
supply with shock (hence the 33.95ea price).  This kit is not required on the
KG5530 Gas-A-Just Shock.  Why do they do this?  Because KYB's 344045 is made
to fit all kinds of other car makes and applications, not just VW Breadloafs.

Why do we have a unique number for these rather than KYB's?  It's so all the
KYB part numbers can sort together in one group on the price list and it
makes it easier for me to keep track of KYB's ever changing prices.
