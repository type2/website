Subject: Re: Transmission ID

Thanks again for the info, Joel!  I'm starting to wonder if this transmission
actually came with the camper.  I know that the engine that was in it did
not.  It was a 1600cc DP with a generator.  I have a 1700cc that I took out
of a '73 that I rebuilt to put in it.  This means that I have an extra 1600cc
sitting around that I had better sell before I find something else to put
around it. ;)  I also took the wiring harness from the '73 to put in the
camper as the prior owner did a butcher job on the wiring in the engine
compartment putting the 1600cc in.  I also had to replace the stock ignition
since he put a new one in the dash.

Thanks again, joel!
