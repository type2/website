&gt; Ideally, I'd like to get my hands on a basic, clean, and reliable model (of an

&gt; concerns for speed, torque, synchro (due to $), or highly priced options...
&gt; call me the turtle, I guess, from the race with the hare. *But*, a camper rig
&gt; is right up my alley, tho. I think you understand. Anyway, I know of the basic
&gt; historical changes in design ('49, '67, etc...) and believe that the third
&gt; (late '70s) will start to be out of my price range. I'm willing to spend
&gt; between $2000-$2500, maybe more if a peach materializes.
 
You should have no problem getting a late 70's Westy for that much.  They
are a dime a dozen around here (San Diego).  You might even get lucky and
find an 80-83 Vanagon Westy for that price, if it is needing some work.

&gt; ps- Not that it should matter, but I'm an employee here.

Cool!  I have some friends that go to Dartmouth... could you, like,
hassle them for me?  :)
