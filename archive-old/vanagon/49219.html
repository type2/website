Subject: RE: 2.1l beyond red line

Hi Tim
      What happened to the rev limiter.  My '86 has a computer controlled
rev limiter set to about 5600rmp.  Seems that the computer should have shut
down the injection system before the motor got above the first part of the
red zone on the tach.  I have missed a shift merging into traffic and over
revved the engine enough for the limiter to function.  The engine just dies
out and a red light comes on inside the tach.  
     Do all 2.1L use a rev limiter??
