Subject: vans for sale

Have seen two East-Coasters shopping for vans on the list today, so I will
mention a friend's shop that has some for sale.  They may have other
pieces I haven't noticed, but for sure they have:
.  80 Vanagon with eight-passenger seating, air, automatic
.  71 Westy with beautiful new white paint, nice interior
.  84? Diesel Vanagon

The shop is Sportwagen, ask for Rory or Robert, 201-489-7828, in Hackensack
NJ.  Mention my name if you like but I *still* won't get anything out of 
whatever deal you make.  I don't know how much they're asking; sorry.
B.
