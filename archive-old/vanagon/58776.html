Subject: Syncro For Sale- still

Hello All you syncro wantabees,
	I still have an '86 Syncro GL to sell. It's a syncro vanagon with 128k
miles on 
it. It's silver with blue interior, has the 5 speed and the diff lock,
seats 7 and is in good condition. The rear seat folds into a bed, the
middle seat backs fold down. 
There is some seam rust on the left side.

	I've been asking 4 thou, but I'm will to listen to offers. It's located in
Traverse City Michigan.
