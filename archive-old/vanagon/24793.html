Subject: Re: Attention all '71 Bus Owners

I was torn between a 1641/87? and a 1776. From what I've heard /
read...Running a large engine
is going to die quicker than a smaller stock engine but the trade-off is
less power! There seems
to be many after market pieces however it seems that they are not as
reliable as stock.
        My ideal engine might be a 1641 with 34-3 carbs and a deep sump oil
pan with
connected extenal oil filter. I might put some of that dryer tubing for a
little extra cooling ;)

&gt;Dear fellow '71 bus owners
&gt;
&gt;I am starting to put together my dream engine.  What I want to know is...
&gt;
&gt;what size(cc), carb (single/dual), heads etc have worked and NOT worked for
&gt;
&gt;your bus.  My main concern is overheating.  Thanks for the imput.
&gt;
