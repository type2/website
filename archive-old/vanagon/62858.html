Subject: offer to bring parts to NE

My wife and I will be driving our van up to the Saco, Maine 
(near Kennebunkport) area from eastern PA at the end of August.  
Since I'm near Ron's Bus Depot (25 minutes) and I'll be picking up 
some parts in the near future anyway, I thought I'd offer to bring 
any parts that people in the Boston/Cape Cod/southern Maine area 
might need from Ron.  No charge...just giving back to the list.

I won't get involved in the payment, esp. since I'd have to pay 
sales tax, but if you work out the payment FOB and this is all 
kosher with Ron, we'll drag them up.  We'll be in the Boston area 
visiting with a former colleague, then Saco, then down to listmember 
Wendy Silva's in Falmouth on Cape Cod. We're running pretty tight 
schedule, so we can't come too far out of the way, but we'll do our 
best.  Also, the van will be fairly full, so no requests for engines, 
please.  :-)  

E-mail me and we'll see what we can work out.

Regards,

-Karl
