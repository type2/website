Subject: Oil pressure
Date: Wed, 12 Apr 1995 16:48:16 PDT

I suppose that oil pressure in general is FAQ-like, but what I'm looking
for is this: Have a lot of you installed &quot;real&quot; oil pressure gauges and
did you like the brand you got? What's a good kind/type to get? Do you
install them in other spots than the regular spots? 

If you're wondering about my interest, my Eggnog A-1 (Rabbit, or Golf I
to some) GL needs both of its oil pressure switches replaced as they both
were sending erroneous signals and one was even leaking oil!

$115 at the F.L.VW.Dealer, because I'm not experienced with oil and I
do not know which local VW shops are reputable yet...

However, my '89 Vanagon may have oil worries someday and I'm interested
in diagnostic tools being installed before they become necessary.

ObVanStory: My 15' canoe has passed its third month of being tied to
the top of my Van. It's amazing how much aerodynamic stability a keeled
aluminum canoe gives a Vanagon... although it is loud in the rain.
