Subject: Turn Signal Flasher Replaced-Wipers NG

(I'm away from my Bentley, so can't refer to wiring diagram.)  Last
weekend I replaced the turn signal flasher unit in my 84 GL with a new,
electronic unit that I purchased at the FLAPS.  Upon removal of the old
unit, I was surprised to note that the new one only had three terminals
while the old one had five or so.  (Yes, I kept it, just in case.)  I
installed the new one anyway (it plugged right into the socket), and
tested all the turn signals and the four-way hazard lights too.  All
worked fine, so I thought, oh well.  It didn't occur to me to try the
windshield wipers.  This morning there was lots of dew on the
windshield, so I tried to use the intermittant position on the wipers to
clear it.  It didn't work at all!  The wipers will work in the low or
high speed position, but they don't &quot;park&quot; when the switch is turned
off.  Now I think I know what those extra contacts on the old flasher
unit were for!  Has anyone else been down this road before?  Has anyone
dealt with this by making their own programmable delay circuit for the
wipers to allow the delay interval to be varied?  Willing to share the
schematic?
