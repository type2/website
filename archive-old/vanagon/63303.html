&gt; Howdy all. Anyone within Driving range of Raleigh, NC is welcome to join
&gt;together for some camping and bus sharing this Saturday night, at the William

They say love your brother, but you will catch it when you try.
Roll down the line, boy, drop you for a loss;
Ride you out on a cold rail road and nail you to a cross.
