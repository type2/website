Subject: Re: Thermostat

I contemplated the value of the thermostat quite seriously during my
recent (and first) rebuild, mainly because I questioned my own ability to
install and adjust it. In the end, though, there really was no question as
to whether or not it should be included. I wanted to do the job right. In
my book, &quot;right&quot; means not second-guessing the engineers who designed the
engine for this versatile, durable family of automobiles. 

One of the best outcomes of the recent rebuild (even though it was top-end
only) is a broader knowledge of the engine and a better gauge of who's
really a mechanic and who's really a hack. I'd be cautious of the latter;
they can do more damage than good. 

Thanks! Joe
