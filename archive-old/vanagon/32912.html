&gt; Martha,
&gt;
&gt; You woulda loved that Coleman catalytic heater! I used to have one and
&gt; here's how you light it: Pour raw Coleman fuel over the catalytic &quot;felt&quot;,
&gt; put a match to it and STAND BACK. This is to get the catalyst hot enough to
&gt; work which leads to your real question....

&gt;
&gt; By the way, although you can't see the catalytic heater burning, they still
&gt; are using up just as much oxygen so all the concerns about proper ventilation
&gt; are still very pertinant.

I used to have a Coleman handwarmer as a paper boy in Illinois.  Worked on
the same principle, about the size of a cigarette pack.  It had a cloth
case and a hole in the metal to light a cigarette.  Used to carry it in my
pocket on sub-zero days and it worked great.  Wish I still had it, but I
doubt if it is EPA or OSHA or FCC or SEC or FDA approved.  Maybe GOP will
bring em back.
