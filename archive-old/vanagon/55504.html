Subject: VW Alloy Wheels

With all this talk about Alloy wheels, I would like to ask one question -

Is there any problem with or adjustment needed when putting standard VW
Westfalia Alloy wheels on a VW that came with steel wheels? 

I am purchasing a '91 Westfalia with standard steel wheels and am planning to
upgrade to VW Alloys that were an option for that year. I was assuming that
this would be 'easy' but discussion on this list has me nervous now!

Thankx-
	Kenyon
