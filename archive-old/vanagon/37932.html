Subject:  Random musings? 

What the !_at_#$%^! is a bay window?

Where does one get these vanagon stickers?

Regarding the who owns the Earth comments, I saw a good sign up at a
Sugarbush I visited last weekend. &quot;We didn't inherit the forest from
our forefathers, we have just borrowed it from our grandchildren.&quot;

Please respond in the first 1/3 of the digest, as my mailer only lets me see
the first 30Kbytes( ;-) )**2

Any Ideas where I can get a head rest, and the piece of plastic that covers
the back of the passenger seat, and keeps all the hay inside in beige for a 76?
If I get these, my van is 'up to factory spec'?
