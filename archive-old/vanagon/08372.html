&gt; &gt;Also, a call for opinions.  This group seems to always have
&gt; &gt;plenty ;)  so I figured this is a good source.  I want to
&gt; &gt;repaint the 68, top to bottom.  Right now it's a pretty dull
&gt; &gt;white.  I'm thinking about painting each below-window body
&gt; &gt;panel a different primary color.  The roof, posts, etc. would
&gt; &gt;be white again.  The rest of it would be, bright, shall we say.

&gt; &gt;You could also mimic the local transit company's bus paint scheme
&gt; &gt;(something that I'm seriously considering as Mr. Bozo's next coat of
&gt; &gt;paint).  The Houston buses say &quot;METRO&quot; - I'll make mine say &quot;MICRO&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; Local transit company?  No no.  We live in a town of 68 people.  Having
&gt; 2 Busses makes us the local transit company.  Therefore, anything goes  :)

with two transit buses, then does this mean that the buses are twice as late?
