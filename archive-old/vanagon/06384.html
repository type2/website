Subject: RE: Wear Index

Those of you with a basement full of old Road &amp; Tracks have Dave Kautz' wear
index already calculated for a lot of cars.  It was on the old-style black
grid data page of Road and Track's road tests.  I'll post some examples if I
remember to venture down there.

(MY basement, not yours, I mean.)
