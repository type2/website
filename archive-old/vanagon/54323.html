&gt;You dog!  Heated seats?  Is there anyway on earth the rest of us mere
&gt;mortals could aquire such a luxury

Factory heated seats??  No.  Buy a Tri-Star.

Aftermarket heated seat covers?? Yes, Martha posted something a month or so ago
about some seat cover kind of things she picked up somewhere that you could plug
into your ciggy lighter. Seemed like an good inexpensive alternative to the real
thing. 
Martha, care to enlighten us about where you got them?
