Subject: Excellent Automotive Books--Add these to book Database

Hi folks,

I discovered two automotive books at my local library that are worth
recommending.   Whoever is in charge of the recommended book archive should
add these to the list.  They are not VW-specific, but would be invaluable
additions to your personal automotive library (or at least worth checking
out of your local library).  The first is &quot;Tuning New Generation Engines for
Power and Economy&quot; by A. Graham Bell (1988, Haynes Publ., ISBN 0 85429 609
3).  Each chapter is devoted to explaining theory, operation and tuning of a
specific engine component, accompanied by relevant specification tables and
very clear line drawings.   There are also detailed descriptions on porting
and polishing heads, among the other useful engine building tips.  Bell is
also the author of &quot;Performance Tuning in Theory and Practice--Four Strokes&quot;
published by Haynes.

The other book is a training manual for automotive technicians.  It gives
very detailed descriptions of component and system functions as well as
troubleshooting training for all automotive systems.  Below, I've included a
description of this book which I took from the publisher's website
(http://www.thomson_dot_com/cgi-bin/plweb/search.cgi).  I usually don't
recommend &quot;generalist training&quot; books like this one, but it's so clearly
written and organized and is so comprehensive in its detailed descriptions
of the latest auto technology that I'd imagine someone from any level of
experience would gain something from it.

I'd love to own both of these, so once y'all pull your pennies together just
let me know, I'll post my address and you can send the books to me--sorta
like a finder's fee ;).
