Subject: 84 vanagon sticking in 3rd



My 84 Westy got stuck in 3rd twice a couple of weeks ago.  First time
I got it unstuck by hitting the selector with a wrench and the second time
it shifted when I tried crawling very slowly in 3rd.  It has been fine for
the last two weeks although its been a little notchy in 3rd ever since
I bought it 10,000 miles ago (mileage app. 150,000).  I have talked to 
some experts and they say that the 3rd &amp; 4th Gear bearing are going and
that it will soon stick permanently in 3rd.  I cannot find a used tranny but
I have found a tranny shop that will fix it (replace all major bearings) for
about $900 including labour (200 less if I take it out myself).  My questions
are:
1. Anyone else had this problem? what happened?
2. How difficult is it to take out the trans?
3. Does this seem like a reasonable price?
4. How much and where can I get a rebuilt trans?
Any info appreciated
