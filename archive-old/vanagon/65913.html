Subject:        fuel injectors

Greetings and salutations:
I am currently replacing the high pressure fuel lines. There is an inch
of hose connected to each injector that does not appear to be easily
replaceable. Has anyone had any success removing and re-attaching hose to
the injector body? I hate the idea of renewing all that hose and having
one burst.
I also noted the old hose which had a plastic sleeve over it was more
flexible(less hardened) than those without it. Of course the replacement
hose is wider than the old ones and does not fit in the old sleeve.What
did you do there?
Good Luck &amp; Drive Safely
