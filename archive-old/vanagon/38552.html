Subject: Re: JC Whitney orders from Canada?

&gt; 
&gt; Any fellow Canadians tried ordering from JC Whitney? I'd like to get
&gt; some interior lights (fluorescent type, like in earlier Westies) to
&gt; go in mine, and I can't seem to find anyone else who sells them.
&gt; 
&gt; I was thinking of trying JC Whitney, unless someone can suggest
&gt; another source...
&gt;

*florescennt* lights?!   what year are you talking about.

As far as i know, the interior lights came either 6V5W or 12V5W and had
plastic covers.
