Subject: An Excerpt

The following is an excerpt from the Jeep list I've recently 
subscribed to.

**snip**
On the main road between Keflavik and Reykjavik, I started spitting and 
sputtering (read BRONCO), and all of a sudden a KEBLANG!  Nothing.  Being 
the trail boss, I pushed over to side of the road, and tried a road fix.  
Couldn't get the thing to run, and antifreeze was spewing out of the 
overflow tank and radiator.  I told the rest of the group to go on (not 
the politically correct thing to do when you're the leader), and wound up 
getting towed back to the base by a VW bus.  EMBARASSING!

Hehehehe.
