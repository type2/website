My wife wouldn't travel without one. No smell if used according to 
instructions.  I built a box for mine with a padded seat for use as a 
extra seat behind the passenger.  Box holds TP, chemicals, 
Porta-Potti, etc.  Shop around, one can sometimes find them on sale 
at sporting goods places.  Mine has two sections, one for clean water 
and one for the other stuff.  Push-on pump for flushing.  One bottle 
of goo lasts for about 4 or is it 8 porta-potti filllings (bottle 
made for full size RV's).  I mounted TP holder inside lid so's it's 
available when lid is up.  Lacks privacy, but we're family anyway.
Should be mounted to bus so it won't move around, but I'm lazy 
that way.  Only difficulty is emptying it.  Easiest to empty straight 
into a toilet.  Messier if using an RV park's dump station.  Used 
ours for our 4 month travel/honeymoon.  We have had it for over 13 
years now. No problems.  Remember air pressure changes when changing 
altitude.  Always open then close valve BEFORE settling into position, 
otherwise a rude/wet awakening from the bottom end pressure and 
residual water in the top end.  YEE HAH !

&gt; I'm thinking of buying a porta-potti for the old westy!  I was wondering
&gt; what those of you who have one think of them (especially, Inuvik
&gt; veterans who had to live with them for 3+ weeks)???  Do they smell up the
&gt; van?  Are they easy to operate?  Are they worth the space?
