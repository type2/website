&gt; &gt; To be considerate, I take lightly traveled trails.  Sometimes I pass
&gt; &gt; two people going the other way, but usually I see no one before or

&gt; &gt; BTW, the tuba sounds great in a vanagon, slightly muffled though since
&gt; &gt; the bell shoots straight up into the ceiling.
&gt; 
&gt; Ah, therein lies the virtue of the roof hatch of the Westfalia!  I
&gt; crank mine wide open (or as wide open as it goes), point my
&gt; euphonium (which is a tenor tuba) in that direction, and it
&gt; works great, except when it's raining.
&gt; 
&gt; Hmmm... that makes at least three brass players (Harold, Grungy,
&gt; and myself) on the Vanagon list...
&gt; 

Hot Damn!  I could just see it on the 'da Trip'.  Picture this now:
An open area in some campground.  A bunch of Type II's, beer keg(s),
and a bunch of people doing a polka with the 'Type II (Brass) Trio' 
providing the music!  

It could happen.....
