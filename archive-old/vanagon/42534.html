Subject: Fuel Injector System

While changing the plugs on my 86 Syncro I noticed that the fuel injector was
just kinda hanging in the port. What actually holds the injector in place?
 There seems to be a couple of o-rings and some sort of gasket. Are they
replaceable  , or do I need to get a complete injector assembly?
       P.S. 
  I was out in Moab Utah last week mountain biking and saw well over 100
different VW vans and campers.  It was kinda like a mobile history of VW's ,
all years and conditions right up to Canadian EV camper that was brand new.
