Subject: Re: $2000 paint job (L)

Rusty replied:
Naw, forget the asbestos, I agree witch ya! I'm just poking fun at myself
and the crap that I've gone thru just to do a once over on this POS bus
o'mine. My original budget was $3,500. for the whole thing. Figuring $2000
for body and paint plus $1500 to cover the engine rebuild and tranny
tweaking. We (my wife and I) didn't want to get sucked into the billion
dollar resto crowd that never drives it in the rain, trailers it to the
event, only if it's sunny and in the mid '70s with low winds from the south.
What we found is that it adds up. The reality of it all is that in order to
get a splitties rockers, fenders, bumpers, rust repaired, redo the rubber
bits, do the tranny and engine correctly, R&amp;R the front end and steering,
brakes, paint, exhaust, etc, etc ,etc. you're gonna spend some bucks. Unless
you get real lucky, cut corners, or are a journeyman jack of all trades the
average person is gonna spend some bucks. The trick is to get a bus that is
dry and sttraight. No flaming retort intended but, I propose that you start
a &quot;virtual&quot; resto and add up the pieces. Don't halfaz the job and do a
complete, thorough, professional job and see how available every little
piece is or isn't. Just see how reliable and affordable every subcontractor
is. See how patient and understanding your SO is. See how your savings and
mothly budget stands up. Tell your self when to draw the line when your
loved one is gonna drive it as a daily driver. It's the story about the
porch and the big dogs. Arm chair quarter backing is one thing and being a
bif or buffy and doing a 'jewel' that's never driven is another. They both
suck. Now go do a bus, do it right, and then use it when its done. That is
what I'm doing. The point is to have fun and enjoy the buggers (or bugs) ;).
We are not rich pukes that pour easy money into our toy for status. We saved
our butts off for years while we drove used up, breaking every day (but
enjoyable) POS's. What we didn't realize was that it costs alot do one nice.
To give a clue, I have more invested in my unassembled '67 Westy than I do
in my '83 Westy that we use every day. We stole the '83 for $4200 with 23800
miles on it. I wouldn't dream of restoring it.
We are doing ONE that's it. Then we're gonna use and enjoy it! (Hopefully
meet and camp with list members). =)))

When we're finished we will be able to say **We did our bit to save a split**

It would be easy to get offended/defensive about armchair quarterback
judgements but I would rather encourage and hopefully help othem to do what
they want in the tiem, manner and budget that they choose. My original
comment about the $2000 clearcoat paintjob with graphics was on target but
out of context. Steve Maher was trying to have fun. I guess I accidentally
blew his high. I didn't intend to bring anyone down. Cool, Thanks to Steve
and Coyote Ron for bringing up very valid points.  This frustrating subject
could and probably will be debated forever. What would be bad is failing to
air our views.

&gt;&gt;Hey, these are cars, not jewels. You know, open road, dust, rain,

&gt;&gt;After that much for materials, I'd have to spend $5K for labor, thus
&gt;&gt;tripling the value of my car. And then I'd be terrified of driving it,
&gt;&gt;for fear of getting the least ding or smudge. Thus I would wind up
&gt;&gt;reducing its value to ZERO!
&gt;
&gt;I have to admit to mixed feelings about this.  I absolutely agree with Steve
&gt;about this, but I do hate to see a new ding on my beautiful van, but I don't
&gt;want to be like those 4x4 owners who hate getting their car muddy (Hi
&gt;Brian!).  Yet I *do* wash and wax Beethoven religiously.  (I even took off
&gt;the luggage rack and cleaned out a ton of crap.  How do those things get IN
&gt;there?)
&gt;
&gt;So I'm going on the Inuvik trip, though it will probably put several years
&gt;on my van... I bought this dream car of mine to get OUT, not to look at and
&gt;sigh.  Inuvik might add several hundred chips to the paint, but my van will
&gt;be doing what it was born to do... fly through the wilderness and provide me
&gt;with a warm bed at night.
