&gt;This may be nit-picking, but just trying to CMA!
&gt;
&gt;For my 85, in doing the heads, I forgot to note where the following ground
&gt;wires were attached.  Can someone help?
&gt;
&gt;There are 3 together in a bundle--I think these go together on the top of
the
&gt;head.
&gt;
&gt;Another 1 comes from the connector mounted to the water pump assembly.
&gt;
&gt;Another 1 is connected to the distributor cover.
&gt;
&gt;Also, there is a 1/2&quot; flat braided strap, about a foot long, grounded to the
&gt;body under the ignition coil.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;If anyone can tell me where these go, thanks-- I'm about ready to turn the
&gt;key 
&gt;(after 6 months!)

There are two 6mm bolt holes in the top of the head on the right side  Split
the wires and bolt there.  Ground strap goes from there to the bdy by the
ignition coil.
