Subject:       commuter dressing-rooms, hormones

I used to commute in one of those Dodge Ram 15 passenger commuter 
vans, 20+ miles (that's 35+ red lights) up route 1 here in NJ - we 
saw drivers doing everything you could imagine - trimming toenails, 
reading, one guy with a laptop computer strapped to his steering 
wheel, the usual hair fixing (including someone doing her own french 
braid), shaving, eyebrow tweezing, eyelash curling, mascara and other 
makeup - but my very favorite was the guy who, stopped at a 
stoplight, unbuttoned his shirt from the bottom up, leaving the top 
button and tie intact, applied his deoderant, then rebuttoned. 

A couple of days ago someone mentioned that hormones that might be 
eaten in treated turkeys revert to their &quot;component proteins&quot;. NO, 
NO, NO! These things do (sometimes) get chemically modified by the 
metabolism processes, but for the most part, they get pissed away - 
they're steroids, not proteins - that's how they do steroid drug 
testing on athletes, as the steroid (sometimes modified) comes out 
the other end.

A note for Joel - I've tried to send this to you without success, but 
you already have my '88 vanagon in your list - I've just changed jobs 
(and therefore email addresses) and no longer have to face route 1.

Happy New Year to all,

Mary Baum
