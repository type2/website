Subject: Re: baja update

Roy,

Don't be too quick to paint Baja with the mainland-Mexico brush.  Once you're
away from the border towns you're in a different country.  They don't vote
the same, they don't think the same and the Federales are very careful about
stepping on toes, since the major land owners in Baja have names like
Melling, Smith and Roberson, all multi-generation Mexican citizens.
