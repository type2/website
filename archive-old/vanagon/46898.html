Subject: Re: fridge problems

I start the frige with propane at the begininng of a trip and shut it off
two weeks (or whatever) when I get home.   The last thing I'd want to do is
worry about the frig tmp every time I stopped!

&gt;Thankyou to all who responded to my query on fridge pilot light going out
&gt;while driving.  I would say that about half of responders drive with propane on
&gt;and half with 12V.  My fridge is so hard to start on propane that I don't
&gt;want to restart it every time I stop!
