&gt;&gt;States.  I drove across from Ontario to B.C. in December halfway through the
&gt;&gt;States, and found that for food and accomodation, we were the same in either
&gt;&gt;country, and gas was cheaper in the States. :-(
&gt;
&gt;Micheal, shame on you for bringing up crass monetary concerns about the
&gt;price of fuel for heaven's sake.  Sure it's a bit cheaper to the
&gt;south but is it really that important?  By the way, how much did you
&gt;spend for gas on your trip form Ont to B.C.?  ...

&gt;  This is said in the spirit of discussion and shouldn't be
&gt;construed as a flame, eh?  --Ralf
No offense taken.  I just wanted to avoid any grumblings if we Canadians
assure everyone of a cheap trip through Canada, and there were no savings.
I definitely think that there are parts of Canada that shouldn't be missed
in a 'round the continent' tour.

The trip across was done in a Volvo.  We went through the States to save
time in going from southern Ontario to Saskatchewan.  We acquired the van
after arriving here on Vancouver Island.
