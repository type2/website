I just finshed swaaping a tired(130K+) 1.9l in my 1985 Camper with a
fresh(46K) 2.1 from a 1988.
Boy, what a difference. I am having a slight problem. After the engine
warms
up the idle
pulses up and down. It doesn't feel like it is going to stall, but it did
not do it in
the van the motor came out of. I believe that all the wires are
connected(no
extras).
I am using the 1.9 ECU and distributor. All plumbing was modified for the
2.1 motor. Has anyone
had a similar experience with their motor.
Any suggestions?

        Tim,
         Out of all the Vanagons I've seen this is a common problem.
         If you elliminate the Idle Stablizer temperarilly the trouble
         goes away. This leads me to believe is it a design Flaw!!!
         If you locate the problem please send the info to the list
         so everyone will benifit.
