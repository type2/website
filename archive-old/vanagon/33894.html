Subject: Old Bus Review Teaser

NonNEATOites:

Snow-turned-to-sleet-turned-to-rain-turned-to-tundra last
night and I trudged over the frozen slush to the mail box
this morning to find the January/February 1996 Old Bus
Review waiting for me.  I plan to sit down in a warm place
and read ink on paper instead of pixels for a while.

But, before I do, just wanted to pass along one brief quote
from the &quot;In This Issue&quot; table of contents:

&quot;And perhaps the largest *Swap Area* ever published in OBR,
pp. 14-20.&quot;

See what you missed by eschewing that snail-mail, send
in-a-check, only-comes-every-two-months, low-tech membership
of $20/year!  I suspect most of you spend that on America
Off Line every month.  He-he-he!

Oh, and the phone is right next to my comfy chair.  Guess I
will have to be the one who calls about the 1966 Single Cab
for $700.  Have I no shame?

Enjoy the glare on your screen....
