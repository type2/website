&gt; 
&gt; Hi, James, 
&gt; Let's just get this straight.... I'm not a &quot;animal right's activist&quot;  I was just
&gt; remarking that it was just kind of unpleasant to see a dead deer hanging off a
&gt; car. I find roadkills just as unappealing. When I was younger I used to go
&gt; hunting w/ my grandfather myself.  I've had quite a few &quot;close calls&quot; too, and I
&gt; used to work part time at a body shop a few years ago, and have seen what a deer
&gt; can do to a car.  I guess as more new development of their natural habitats
&gt; increases, especially in rural woodand areas like that in N.E.  P.A., then this
&gt; problem will rise. Too bad there is no real solution. Hunters don't even really
&gt; make a &quot;dent&quot; in their population. I have read some study that said in the last
&gt; 10 years, the  deer population is actually increasing.
&gt; 

The easiest best solution is to decrease the human population.
