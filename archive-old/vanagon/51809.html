Subject: Re: Ignorant glow plug question

&gt; Please excuse this question as it is easily answered by the manuals, but I do
&gt; not have any yet and am in the process of ordering several.
&gt; On a '82 diesel Westy, what does the pull out cold start lever actually do??  I
&gt; looked at the injection pump where the cable attaches and did not see any
&gt; electrical connections.  I used to think that this lever actuated the glow
&gt; plugs, but now I don't see how it could.  What does it do and are the glow
&gt; plugs controlled by a relay, independently??
&gt; 
The cold start advances (or retards, I'm not sure) the timing to 
promote smoother cold running. In newer diesels, it is a two step 
know - first stop does timing, second one boosts idle by about 300 
rpm. In very cold weather, the engine may actually fire quicker withe 
knob in, then pulled out quickly once the engine's started. (My 
experience, anyway. This is only at temp's below 0 C (32 F).
Glow plugs are controlled by a relay which is activated by the 
coolant temp sensor on the trans end of the cylinder head.
