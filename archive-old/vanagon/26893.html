There is an urban legend of a guy strapping a JATO unit to the top of
a chevy nova out in the desert.

ran out of &quot;runway&quot; and slammed into a cliff at better than 300mph.

The authorites that scraped him off the cliff (ala Wiley Coyote) thought
it was a plane crash at first...

(I can see this thread already:  &quot;A JATO unit would have been pure _luxury_
for use; we had to use a saturn V booster rocket...)
