Subject: Friday and no Vanagon list mail? has the world come to an end?



Really, where are the Friday sillies, poems, songs, etc..???
for a change this is one Friday I do not have too much to do :-),
and everyone else on the list seems busy :-(

Or is it just that everyones out driving their bricks and enjoying the
sun???
