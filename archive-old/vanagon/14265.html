&gt; Jon Christensen responded to my transaxle woos - suggesting my reduction

&gt; a 74 westy interior kombi camper.  My split is new to me (since Dec.).
&gt; What kind of job is it to R&amp;R the reduction gear? (I didn't bring my manuals
&gt; to werk.)  Does it make sense that the noise would cease when I press in
&gt; the clutch?  BTW, the transaxle has a slow leak but the fluid level checked
&gt; out ok.  Also, the noise seemed to be loudest near the rear pass. side.  
&gt; Thanks Jon, I'll look into the RGs first

You're welcome!  8-)  I see nobody else has come forward to answer your 
R&amp;R on the reduction gear ?'s, so I'll take a stab at it.  This requires 
some oddball tools.  The nut on the back of the reduction gear (RG)stub axle 
needs a ?size metric socket to remove and it helps to have a big clamp.  
I'd like to offer some advice to supplement a manual which really is 
needed.  Loosen the axle nut before getting started.  Jack up one rear 
to get one of the rear wheels and drum off and use a jack stand on a 
steady surface to secure the van, but do not jack it up very high. After 
draining the tranny &amp; RG lube, remove the backing plate and RG housing 
bolts.  Use a large c-clamp around the outer RG housing and the spring 
plate to make the springplate bolts easier to remove w/o stripping the 
threaded alloy material (easy mistake to make).  Once this is done, 
you'll have to remove the plug in the RG housing that was behind the 
spring plate.  It is usually difficult to remove this nut.  I've had to 
re-bolt the axle housing's frontmost bolt onto the rearmost bolt hole on 
the springplate and then put the wheel &amp; brakedrum back on the splined RG 
stub axle to hold it in place to remove this nut.  You'll be frustrated 
at first, but you'll find it satisfying to get the thing off--just make 
doublely sure that the van is securely jacked &amp; stable. The rest of the 
job will seem easy as long as the bearings are willing to be removed from 
their bearing 'nests'.  If they're badly worn, sometimes it is difficult to 
remove them, but be persistent.  That's all my advice for now!!  Good Luck!
