Subject: Re:Save your balls from busted rubbers (?'s)

Yes me to. The upper boots on my westy cracked,joints still good, also tie
rod ends boots.I like Martin suggest with the tape repair, where do you get
the rubber tape?
Have any of you tried putting grease fittings on the all the ball joints
and the tie rod joints? Can it be done with them still on the bus? (Room to
drill holes for fittings etc.) I know I had a datsun pick-up for years with
busted boots just pumped in new grease at ever oil change, never replaced.

Also the boots on my rebuilt power steering gone to hell. PO replaced unit,
maybe the mechanic used the old boots or the after market boots poor
quality of rubber.(?) Should I buy boots from VW or any good after market
boots available?
