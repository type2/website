Subject: A RIGHTEOUS RIDE

My wife and I just did a 3,000 beautiful Fall trip up to Illinois for my 30th year High 
School reunion.
We camped and saw wonderful Fall foliage from the windows and camping room view of our 
1969 VW Pop Topper.

We camped by lake, streams, in national forests, etc. the whole trip.

The trip was just too cool, even if.....
Both rocker arms came loose from the engine during the trip,
Valves needed adjusting during the trip,
New points and plugs had to be installed,
Engine had to be pulled,
Fly wheel came loose from engine,
New fly-wheel had to be put on put on the engine,
Auxiliary oil sump came loose from the engine belly,
etc.

IT WAS A RIGHTEOUS RIDE, MAN !!

WE ARE READY FOR ANOTHER TRIP RIGHT NOW !!
