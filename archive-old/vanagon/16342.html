On Gerry's suggestion, here's the text of the flyer:

Busses by the ARCH
1514 Wild Goose Run
St. Charles, MO 63303

(Mark your calendars: BBTA #9 is September 1, 2, &amp; 3, 1995.)

BBTA #8: Fort Zumwalt Park, O'Fallon, Missouri, May 26, 27, &amp; 28, 1995.

Come join us for the upcoming &quot;BUSSES BY THE ARCH&quot; camping weekend
sponsored by NEATO/LIMBO. This family camping event will feature a
gathering of Volkswagen Transporters of all types and eras from all over
the U.S.A. We are looking forward to seeing both you and your type II
amidst all the &quot;Split-windows&quot;, &quot;Bubble-windows&quot;, Vanagons and other VW's
this spring!

&quot;BUSSES BY THE ARCH 8&quot; will be held rain or shine Friday thru Sunday, May
26, 27, and 28, 1995 at scenic Fort Zumwalt Park in O'Fallon, Missouri.
This well wooded, grassy park is located only 1/2 mile off Interstate 70
and about 30 miles west of downtown St. Louis and the Gateway Arch. Most
any convenience you might ever need is within a mile of camp. Domino's
will even deliver pizza to your campsite!

On both Friday and Saturday evenings we plan to have campfire activities,
volleyball, raffles, parts swapping and VW videos in addition to the
&quot;site-to-site&quot; socializing and &quot;bus-banter&quot; that NEATO/LIMBO events are
famous for. Saturday we're planning another of our famous scenic caravans
with a picnic stop. Yes, we plan to return to our very popular &quot;Double
River Crossing&quot; tour on the car ferrys. There will be owners choice awards
presented on Saturday evening. It should prove to be a Spring weekend full
of great Volkswagen experiences and new friendships.

The camping facilities at Fort Zumwalt features 40 spacious sites in two
separate grassy and wooded loops. Camping loop #1 is where our busses will
gather. We are near Lake Whetsel (no swimming and fishing) and it's a
short walk to the shower/bathroom facilities. A few campsites have
electric hookups on loop #1. Campsites can't be reserved in advance. Site
selection is on a &quot;first come, first served&quot; basis. The earlier you arrive
the better. Only VW's camping at the event will be allowed into the event
campsite loop. A onetime fee at registration of $20 covers your campsite
fees (whether for one night or all three!), raffle ticket for lots of door
prizes, and event fees.

We're looking forward to your arrival for a full weekend of Volkswagen
fun. Please pass the word around to your VW friends about our NEATO/LIMBO
event. Wipe down and pack up those Transporters for the cruise into St.
Louuis for the &quot;BUSSES BY THE ARCH 8&quot; campout on May 26, 27, and 28, 1995
in O'Fallon, Missouri.

Note: I will still send you the original flyer if you would like to
redistribute it, for example. FAX is probably not a good idea after all,
because of the small print. Sami
