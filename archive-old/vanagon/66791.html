I have an EV MV 1993 and have been basically pleased...especially to have a
HEATED VW van for my three kids.  We paid as much as the price you listed for
an EV with 75,000 miles so it sounds like a great deal to me.  Only concern
might be to find out if the AC has gone yet and been replaced.

'78 Pop top
'93 EV MV
'79 bus/shed
and alas...our first non-VW ever...'88 Toyota Corolla our neighbors &quot;gave&quot; us
for $400.  We retired our Rabbit to the woods for the second and last time.
