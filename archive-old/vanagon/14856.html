&gt; &gt; &gt; Just wanted to peg the speedo so I could say, &quot;I pegged the
&gt; &gt; &gt; speedo!&quot;.  You get the idea.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Can't you just hook the Dremel to the speedo cable and do
&gt; &gt; the same thing??? [grin]

But - if you chuck the end of the speedo cable up in the dremel you
be lugging it (the dremel) trying to get the tire spinning too. 8^)....
