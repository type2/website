Subject: Re: &quot;Bird Nest&quot; Air Filter

&gt; Just a hypothetical question...
&gt; 
&gt; What would be the effect on performance if the regular air filter in a 73
&gt; Westy was supplemented by an additional  &quot;medium sized bird nest including
&gt; a few baked feathers&quot; filter, underneath the pleated paper filter.
&gt; 
&gt; Was this a factory option, or was it more likely to have been installed by
&gt; the dealer?   Can I still get parts (twigs, wool) or will I have to replace
&gt; the entire &quot;bird nest&quot; as an assembly?

I've tried to get individual components for this module and can't find anyone
who supplies them anymore.  Apparently back in the 70s, when yours was
installed, there were quite a few people specializing in supplying small parts.
Once the manufacturer stopped using the modules, these guys found other
niches to fill.  You'll just have to go to the dealer and pay the piper.  Sorry.
