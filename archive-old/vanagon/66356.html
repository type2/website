Subject:      Phosphate-free anti freeze

Is it really essential to use phosphate-free anti freeze?  I am due for a
change and am pretty sure that the PO used a typical ethylene-glycol brand.
 My local VW dealer has some official phosphate-free for
$ 14/gal.  Is there any other brand that is appropriate at a more
reasonable cost?
