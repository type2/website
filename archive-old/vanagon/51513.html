Just curious, but should not camber remain the same with any vertical
wheel travel on this rear  independent suspension?

&gt; A couple of weeks ago a list member posted questions about the
&gt; Vanagon rear suspension.  The poster was experiencing excessive wear
&gt; on the inside of the rear tires, and wondered:
&gt;
&gt;      1) could worn springs affect the rear camber to such an extent
&gt;         to cause this wear, and
&gt;      2) was it possible for the shade tree mechanic to fix this
&gt;         condition with new springs?
&gt;
&gt; I only saw one reply posted which suggested getting some gas shocks
&gt; for the rear.  The reply _suggests_ the answer to 1) is &quot;Yes&quot; and the
&gt; answer to 2) is &quot;No&quot; (or &quot;it's too hard&quot;).
&gt;
&gt; Since I'm having the same rear tire wear problem I thought I post the
&gt; questions once again.
