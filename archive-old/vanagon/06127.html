Subject: RE: Original license plate mounting 

&gt;From: Ken Wiebe &lt;kwiebe_at_pipeline_dot_com&gt;

&gt;Anyone know what the original/official method was to mount the 
&gt;front license plate on the 71 bus?  All the owner/sales photos 
&gt;(etc.) show the bus (of course) without a front plate at all.  
&gt;Real-life buses I've observed employ a myriad of bumper styles 
&gt;and methods for mounting.  (BTW, I believe mine is the original 
&gt;bumper, a simple 'blade' with a slightly convex front surface)

I remember our 72 bus and 85 vanagon both having the blade that you
mention.  The center being attached to the bumber with two bolts
and the ends holding the licsence plate.

Years ago I took off the blade and put in a license plate frame that
looked much better.  I was worked at a vehicle processing plant where
one of the items I did was to check what was the final destination for
the cars.  If that state required front plates we had to put in a license
plate frame that came with the car.  If not, it went with the cars trunk
for later application.  One day I found a bent one in the trash.  I took
it home and straightend it.  Drilled two holes on the front and two on the
bottem of the bumber.  Pop riveted it in place and attached the license
plate in place.  I looked like a factory item instead of the old way with
the plate sticking out.
