Subject: Gauges Again (was: warr/heads/gasket/oil leaks)

David, where are you planning on mounting your gauge(s)? I've been contemplating
adding the magic trio (oil temp, press, cyl head temp), but haven't finalized my
decision on where to stick them. Anyone, anyone?

While we're (I'm) on the topic, for those of you that have build home built 
gauges (DVM with appropriate senders), does anyone have any resistance vs 
temp/pressure curves for common (like VDO) senders? Are they linear, at least 
over the range we'd be interested in?

I've never seen any published, and would be really useful for the resourceful 
(and slightly nerdy) VW owner...

One idea would be to put small digital or bar-graph displays right in the middle
of the Vanagon instrument cluster where the small rectangular dummy indents are.

-Erik (_not_ counting myself in the slightly nerdy group... well maybe slightly)

&lt;Good stuff snipped...&gt;

&gt; As for the cooler it is somewhat jury rigged: an empi cooler mounted above
&gt; the tranny with &quot;homebuilt &quot;fan and switch. It works well. As of now I am
&gt; installing an oil temp gauge so I will have some answers for you. If you
&gt; areoverheating this may be a way to go ....as for heads consider GEX or
&gt; someother outfit in CAL. I have some addresses if you need them Regards -
