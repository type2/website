                    Minding Your Own Business

Growing up in a small central California town during World War II
had a curious effect on my age.  If you were big enough to do a
thing, you were expected to do it and your age wasn't a
consideration.  That rule saw me driving a tractor when I was
eight and piloting the Model-T into town on errands, a feat that
made my older cousin David wild with envy for he couldn't crank
the T-model, nor was he tall enough to reach the pedals.  He
assumed the role of co-pilot.  I was a big kid so the cranking
and driving fell to me.  I didn't think it exceptional, it was
the natural order of things.

A typical chore was picking up chicken mash at the feed store, or
repair parts from the Ford dealer.  Once we carried home an
irrigation pump from the machine shop where it had been fitted
with a new impeller.  The pump was so heavy the front wheels of
the Model-T came off the ground when I crossed the railroad
tracks.  Naturally, we had to back up and try it again.

Such errands never involved money.  Back then, the economy of
every small town ran largely on trust.  Everyone knew my
grandfather, who paid his bills promptly the first of each month.
When running such errands we were always admonished to 'mind to
your business.'  As my grandfather's agents we were duty-bound to
make no side trips and to offer no rides, other than to ladies
burdened with packages.  We couldn't even buy ourselves an icy
Dr. Pepper unless the necessary nickels needed to do so were
provided along with our instructions.  Yet getting there and
getting back was up to us.  We were told what had to be done and
left to get on with it.  Our 'business' was to make a safe,
successful trip to town and back.  And we took our business
seriously, aside from catching a little air now and then.
 
After bringing home a rebuilt or repaired part, the next step was
to dismantle it in order to clean it.  New, ready-to-use parts
were rare things during the war and even those required cleaning
since the cast iron was usually coated with protective grease. 
Aluminum parts were unheard of.  Like the chrome-based green dye
on packages of Lucky Strike cigarettes, aluminum too had gone to
war.

The need to clean a part before installing it remains valid today
although many aluminum parts are wrapped in protective paper
instead of being coated with preservative.  But a heavy
preservative similar to Cosmoline is still used to protect new
sets of Volkswagen cylinders &amp; pistons, and it must be removed
before the parts can be used.

About twenty years ago I saw a fellow rebuilding a Volkswagen
engine at a local garage.  He was plucking cylinder assemblies
right out of the box and slapping them on the engine.  No
cleaning.  No inspection.  Thinking he didn't understand, I
pointed out the need to clean them and was told to mind my own
business, along with an ear-full about the hundreds of VW engines
he had built and his years of experience.  The fellow was perhaps
twenty years old, half my age at that time.  The garage is no
longer in business.

I was reminded of the incident today as I was scrubbing a
new set of forged Mahle pistons destined for Bob Polys' engine. 
The pistons and other parts are going to the balancing shop
tomorrow and it's important that every trace of the heavy
preservative be removed.  And there was a lot of it, more than
the usual amount.  It looked as if one of the pistons had been
dipped in the stuff.  A mere rinse in the solvent tank didn't
begin to remove the gummy tan grease, it took a lot of scrubbing
with a fiber-bristled brush and running a bore brush through the
oil scraper holes before it came clean.

Free of the heavy grease and blown dry with compressed air, the
gram-scale showed only a few tenths difference across the set of
four pistons, close enough for a regular repair.  But the two-
liter Polys engine will spend much of its life above five
thousand rpm so the pistons will be matched to a tenth of a gram. 
A tenth of a gram of aluminum, not grease.  

Had the pistons not been cleaned, the heat of running and the
constant spray of oil from the journals would eventually remove
the heavy coat of Cosmoline.  But in the case of the piston with
the blocked oil scraper holes, I doubt if the engine would have
broken in properly.

I've already posted an article about jugs, explaining the need to
scrub the cylinders and paint them, and to clean the pistons and
rings, even though the parts are brand new.  But having led the
horse to water, the rest of the job depends on the horse.   

The growing popularity of the Internet is causing many Volkswagen
owners who have never heard of the various VW-specific mailing
lists to discover the archive of postings maintained by Richard
Kurtz.  Sometimes they're happy with what they find.  And
sometimes they are not.

Recently, a fellow purporting to be a mechanic happened across the
archive and took me to task over the 'Jugs'  article saying many of the
same things I heard from that other fellow twenty years ago.  (This fellow
referred to my continual emphasis on attention to detail as 'anal
retentive' which shows he knows even less about psychology in
general and the theories of Sigmund Freud in particular, than he
does about auto mechanics.)

This fellow's main complaint seemed to be that he had not seen 
any of my suggestions '...in the magazines' or manuals.  I've no
idea what manuals he's been reading but when it comes to
'magazines' I can make a pretty good guess.  

My response was to direct him toward another source providing the
same information.  Although I couldn't find a reference to
painting cylinders in Tom Wilson's excellent &quot;How to Rebuild Your
Volkswagen Air-Cooled Engine,&quot; I notice the engine pictured on
the cover of the book has painted cylinders.  And on page 132
under the heading 'Clean Parts' Mr. Wilson says what all
competent mechanics say -- scrub the jugs.  &quot;Such parts are
shipped with dirt-collecting grease and oil, and are never
cleaned at the factory with engine assembly in mind.  That is
your job.&quot;

                       Sermonette

Free advice being worth exactly what you pay for it, when it
comes to overhauling Volkswagen engines, if you've never done one
the wiser course is to seek the widest possible range of
opinions.  And if someone offers an opinion, they should be
willing to support it in the form of additional references and so
forth.  A few questions will be enough for you to tell if the person's
opinion is based on factual experience or second-hand
information, perhaps gleaned from one of the VW-specific
magazines, whose primary business is selling magazines rather
than overhauling engines.  

Automotive engineering is a mature technology with a relatively
narrow range of acceptable procedures for doing any given job. 
As you gather opinions on how best to do something you should see
a distinct pattern, in that professional, experienced mechanics
and engineers tend to do a given task in one particular way, and
will offer a sound, well-reasoned justification for their chosen
method.  These are people who know their business, and no one can
properly teach a subject they have not themselves mastered.  In
that regard, I think it would be best to use magazine articles
for their illustrations and to discount their textual content
unless it can be verified by other, non-magazine related sources. 
When it comes to engine overhauls, magazine writers and editors
can surely teach us all a great deal about selling magazines.  

When you overhaul an engine you are the Mechanic in Charge, the
success of the job is up to you.  For the duration of the job you
are in the engine overhaul business.  And it always pays to mind
your own business.
