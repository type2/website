Subject: RE: Confession and heat


&gt;WOW, what a difference it makes to have heat in my Vanagon.  The heater for 
&gt;the front of the van never did throw off much heat.  I've felt like I'm 
&gt;driving around in a  small drafty cave for the past two years.  Now that 
&gt;there is heat in the van, it feels like a modern vehicle.  Wow, it's really 
&gt;nice to have heat.  What a difference! Ya know, these Vanagons are OK....

I guess TC, that you did not evolve with the line of VW vans from the 
 old Type II air cooled systems to these nifty waterboxers.   You could 
 never get any heat but there were plenty of drafts. 
I recall driving from Utah to so Cal. in my 72 Westfalia, with full ski 
 gear on, sleeping bag wrapped around my legs with the zipper allowing 
 my foot on the gas pedal, down parka and hat, and shivering all the 
 way to LA. Brrrr.
