Subject: Hard Shifting..sometimes

&gt;    Since acquiring her, Ramona has always displayed hard shifting from time
&gt;to time. Sometimes, she's smooth, and sometimes I can't even downshift from
&gt;3rd to 2nd. She just won't go. I've had the trans gear oil
&gt;checked/drained/replaced, but that didn't make a difference. My question is
&gt;this: when I have the engine out and her guts exposed, how do I check on this
&gt;problem? What do I look for? Is it something that I can check before removing
&gt;the engine? Any ideas or similar fiascos? Y'know, she doesn't pop out of gear
&gt;ever, but this thing with the tuff shifting is getting me all worried.
&gt;HELP!!!!!!!sos!!!!!!!
&gt;Again, thanks.  Rach
&gt;
Yep, sounds just like what I have with my 71.  I think that the problem is 
with the guide bushing on the shifter.  I replaced mine, expecting the 
shifting to improve, but to no avail.  I was expecting the slop to be gone 
too, but again... NOT.  The only thing that you can do is to adjust the 
shifter's guide plate, which will hopefully make some difference.  The idea 
is to push the plate over to the right so that you can't pull the shifter 
toward you (ie. left) any more than is needed to engauge 2nd.  I know that 
someone mentioned the guide bearing which for us upright fan guys probably 
isn't a problem (IMHO).  When I had my engine out, I noticed that the pilot 
shaft had lots of play in it, ie. side to side, but I don't know if this is 
related or not.  I have talked to my local VW shop about this, and he says 
the VW shifter is junk anyway.  His solution is a Gene Berg shifter which he 
says is worth every nickel.  I think like $135! (Eugene, care to comment?)   
I dunno.  Personally, I think getting a new guide bushing machined out of 
brass or bronze would make vast improvements in the shifting.

Hope this helps.
