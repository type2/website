Subject: It's been lonely...

After the VW Classic I *thought* that I resubscribed to the list. I finally
decided that I was way too productive at work and that I was not getting my
usual five billion VANAGON messages per day. After quick scientific
methodology, I figured out that I must have pushed Big Gers hot button or
forgot to resub. So here I be. Back to haunt y'all!
