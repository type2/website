&gt; &gt;Any advice as to the problem? The thermostat is removed, and there's a 2
&gt; &gt;inch gap in the engine seal near the rear that I plan on fixing, could that

&gt; 1.  Thermostat??? In an air cooled engine?  Maybe its just late and I'm not
&gt; thinking clearly.

Yep, there's a thermostat that controls some flaps.
I just found that the flaps on my bus didn't have the spring that is
supposed to hold them open hooked up... so I guess the flaps were flapping
around.  I also checked the thermostat, and it wasn't functioning.  $25 for
a new one... a bit more than the $5 for my Chevy.  But at least now it's
all working ok.
