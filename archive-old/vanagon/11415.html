Subject: latest on Westy..

Well, I had an interesting discussion with a VW 'expert'.  He is Burkhard
Frannke, has a VW shop in Flagstaff, and claims to have been doin' the
VW thing for forty years.

I dumped all my parts on his garage floor (case, crank, rods), and he 
whipped out his trusty very-near calipers, and started measuring here
and there.  Then he says to me with a sad shake of his head, &quot;git yerself
a new case, a new crank, und start ofer!&quot;  It turns out the case has 
already been bored over .040&quot;, and the crank (the pretty, shiny, expensive,
counterweighted one) has been ground several times already.  He recommended
I get a new Mexican case, and a new stock crank.  This guy claims 'stock'
is the *only* way to go.  He even raised his eyebrows over the machining
I had done for the external oil filter.  He also took me out back where
his stock '71 pickup was sitting.  After sitting 4 months (he claims), it
started right up, and I must say, it was the smoothest, quietist air-cooled
engine I've probably ever heard.  And there wasn't a drop of oil on the
outside of the case anywhere!

So...

Being the frugal, practical (=broke) guy I am, I think what I'll do is
just buy new bearings, slap it all together, and see if I can make it
to Cottonwood and/or Red Rock Canyon and back.
