Subject: 89 syncro, binds in tight turning

My friend has a 89 syncro, just purchased.  When turning tight.  The wheels
bind and have a lurching sensation.  The characteristics seem like the rear
diff is locked.  VW machanic say the CV's are fine.  He said it is a normal
function of a Syncro.  We don't think that is the case.  I Don't have a
Syncro so I can't compare.  Does this happen to other Sycro owners?
