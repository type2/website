Subject: Re: exhaust success

whats the deal with stainless steel nuts in exhaust anyway?

I just finished putting a new 'drop pipe' on my 83 Diesel V. - i used 
a nut cracker and chisels to get the old ones off (any resemblance between them
and new nuts was truly coincidental) - i put SS back on - will these things
still look like nuts whnenext muffler time comes along??

anyone have long term experience here.

They are softer than reg steel so even if i do have to chisel it
should be an easier job :-)
