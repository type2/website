Subject: Re: Seat covers for 86 Bus Plus

&gt;FYI, the Bus Plus is a Westy w/o appliances, except for a removable 12/110V
&gt;Dometic refrigerator behind the passenger seat*, and a pull-up table
&gt;between the back seats. I prefer it to the full on conversion, because the
&gt;rear seat is as wide as the van, hence, like a couch for that person to
&gt;stretch out while playing cards with the person in the rear facing seat
&gt;(that seat lifts up for great storage space). Full conversion is only two
&gt;across in rear, not enough room for a couch: love-seat? Being Californians,
&gt;my ms. and I prefer to cook outside anyway, and have a portable propane
&gt;stove with 1 gal. refillable tank, and one of those cool folding picnic
&gt;tables to put it on. Also works fine inside if weather is inclement.
&gt;
&gt;*I removed the refrigerator and use it at home for storing beverages: works
&gt;much better on 120V than 12V, where it's only good for 8-12 hours running
&gt;on auxiliary battery.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!

Huh?? A &quot;Bus Plus&quot;?????   wot du hek?  

Uh, Oh..... you have just elicited a response from that damned  &quot;Mr correct
terminology&quot; again...

What you have is a '86 Vanagon Wolfsburg Edition (non-GL) &quot;Weekender Westy&quot;.
or affectionately dubbed the &quot;WWW&quot; for short. (no, not world wide web... it's
&quot;Wolfsburg Weekender Westy&quot;) this was a stripped down version of the westy, and
was available in '85 and '86. 
The interior you have is the tan corduroy, which shreds instantly the first time
you sit on it. (I'm serious!!) This was the most lame interior cloth VW ever
came out with (maybe that's why this model only lasted 2 years??) and every
&quot;WWW&quot; I've seen has a shredded interior. 

This non-GL model also lacks a digital clock and tach., among other niceities
available on the GL's. 

Your only alternative is to have custom covers made by hand, for your seats. You
won't be able to buy these in your local Bus Plus seat cover store.......

&quot;Bus Plus&quot; ...........  man... how long did it take you to make that one up????
:&lt;)

Sorry guys....I know it ain't Friday yet.... but I just fired up the
barbeque........
anyone for some ribs??? (or an elbow in the rib?)  nya  nya ....lighten up....
:&lt;)

chris
