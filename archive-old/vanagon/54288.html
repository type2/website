Subject: 88 westie intermittent starting problem





I have an electrical problem with my '88 westie that is beginning to tax
(t'is the season) my electrical illiterate brain.

This happens intermittently.
Turn key, engine cranks but doesn't start.  Give fuse box a minor shake or
two, turn key, engine starts and runs fine.

That solution worked fine until I was 50 miles from home and the shaking
didn't help.  VW dealer I had it towed to moved the power supply to the
fuse box (old port was burned out) and that worked fine for about a week.
Same symptoms, same solution.

Drove back to that dealer to have them relook at the problem and of course
it could not be reproduced.

When this problem happens there seems to be no power going to the fuel pump
( I can't hear it ).

Your thoughts are welcomed,

Paul
