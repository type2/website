	Ok, I just Did It- I'm ordering a turn-key, smog-legal,
1970 Bus motor with hydraulic valves, breakerless electronic
ignition (Compufire) and a dog-house oil cooler. Mark at ECI
is building it for me and it'll cost $1650, delivered to my
door, with a clutch kit. He'll give me $140 core charge for the
ES21 case, rods, crank, heads, rockers, etc.
	I should have taken Former Owner's Friend's $200 offer
for all that stuff- if anyone here wants it, sing out.

	I'd say this is a heck of a deal. The only difficult
part is I won't make it to Big Sur- provisional shipping date is
the 11th.

	I know this sorta goes against the DIY ethos of this organization,
and it sure is a pile of money. I'm sure there's plenty left for me
to do, and life is short. I'd rather drive a bus than fix a bus.
