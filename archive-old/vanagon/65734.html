&lt;&lt; &gt; Bus for sale:
 &gt; Its a 1978 Grand Sport, has an automatic transmission and air conditioning
 &gt; ( which they just had converted to R134 and is pretty much new).  Both
 &gt; the 2000 engine and tranny were rebuilt a few thousand miles ago.   Her
 &gt; and her husband bought it at a show a few years back, but now they are
 &gt; buying a new mazda (some people) and need to get ris of it.  she was
 &gt; asking 4800 but was 'somewhat flexible'. &gt;&gt;

WOW...for $4800 this &quot;Grand Sport&quot; better have the Buick GS V6 engine....
 :&lt;)
