I have a water leak from the little heater under the rear passenger seat. I
replaced the plastic tap and washer as per the Technical Bulletin. However
there is now a bigger leak from elsewhere. The tech bulletins mentioned
another cause as being the T-piece from the feeder hose to the main hose,
but I cannot see how that can cause a leak inside the car since as far as I
can tell the T-pieces are outside?

How likely is it to be the radiator matrix itself, and where would I get a
replacement - main dealer only?

BTW I am really pleased with this heater. The front heater does not seem to
duct towards the back as it did in the aircooled (vents on the floor
between the 2 front seats). Is this for all watercooleds or only the ones
with a rear heater?
