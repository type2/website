Subject: reverse lights - more wierdness


ha ha - you thought my reverse light story was over !!!

Reverse lights on my 83 Vanagon arent working - inspection overdue. Traced
problem to switch by shorting at switch, replaced switch, problem not
fixed.

Yesterday, after doing back brakes on the Quantum, put the V up on the ramps
to have another go at the damn reverse switch. Backed it up, left key on
went back and the lights are shining!

Take it  off ramps and they dont work???????

Upshot is (after driving up and down ramps several times) that when the bus
is inclined the reverse lights work and when its level they dont. 

My guess is its hard not to imagine a trans problem of some bizarre nature -
i dont see how the relative positions of the trans and the rl switch can
be changed by ramping the van....

did spend a good half hour inspecting wires, shaking all the wires with
switch shorted, can say with autority that i dont have an intermittant
wiring problem.

I think i am going to try out putting tape on the switch to extend its reach
a bit, if this doesnt work then i will wire in a switch from the dash...i hate
doing that , its only a few weeks away from the van being on it  top in the
front yard with animals living in it .......:-)

sps
