Subject: Re: FRONT TURN LENSES '72 BUS
Date: Thu, 11 Apr 1996 12:41:21 GMT


You are essentially right from what I have seen. Except there are
a few 1971 busses with the turn lenses just like the 1973 models.
We owned one of these unusual 1971 busses once, and I have seen 
two others.


&gt; Subject: Front turn lenses '72 bus
&gt; 
&gt; Could some kind soul please clear this up for me?  I am at work 
&gt; without all of my jiffy manuals.  Also, I posted this to the group and
&gt; I want to get things corrected if I posted in error.  This would be 
&gt; for U.S. spec vehicles.
&gt; 
&gt; '71 has the low down front turn lenses, several inches up from the 
&gt; bumper.  Also, it has the single  oval red lens in back and the back 
&gt; up light above that, seperately mounted.
&gt; 
&gt; '72 has the same lenses up front and the one piece clear, amber, red 
&gt; tailights.
&gt; 
&gt; '73 has the way up front lenses, on either side of the air intake 
&gt; thing on the front of the bus, several inches below the windshield and
&gt; the same rear lenses described for the '72 bus.
&gt; 
&gt; Yell if this is wrong.  The '72 shares the front brakes with my '71 so
&gt; I keep my eyes open for them.  Calipers and disks for these are tres 
&gt; tres expensive.  Jim
