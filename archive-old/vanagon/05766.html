&gt; &gt; A ford Dealer offered me 10K for my 91 Vanagon Carat that has a wholesale
&gt; &gt; blue book value of 11.8K...Are they trying to rip me off?? They say that there
&gt; &gt; is not a market for VW Vanagons...and didnot believe that the blue book value
&gt; &gt; is realistic....(my van is in good shape).....Does anybody have any advice??
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, it sounds like a rip off. At least here in California. the dealers 
&gt; tell me they can't keep a Vanagons on the lot. A friend in the car 
&gt; business told me he almost always has to pay MORE than wholesale book for 
&gt; clean ones.

The Vanagon market seems to vary dramatically, depending on where you 
are.  Here in Seattle, they're all over the place and want-ads seem to 
last 1-2 days, and the prices seem relatively high, also reflecting 
demand.  I've had at least half a dozen people ask me if I'd like to sell 
my '91 Westy in as many months, and twice in the same period have found 
&quot;if you want to sell your van, call xxx-xxxx&quot; notes on my windshield in 
parking lots.
