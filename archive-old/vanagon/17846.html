&gt;I though I'd let the group know that if you happen to have an unused switch
&gt;slot below the emergency light switch, I have something to fill it with.

just for info's sake: there is an accessory switch (for the fog lights)
that fits into this slot ... i don't have the number handy, but if anyone
wants it, i can find it at home. it's an orderable part from vw parts (some
dealers actually stock them!).

only problem with the switch (if you want to use it for other purposes) is
it's a double ON position. that is, the first click is ON and the second
click is also ON. this is for the red rear fog light to be turned on first,
and then the front fog lights.
