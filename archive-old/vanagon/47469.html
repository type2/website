&gt;What are the pros and cons of tinting the windows in a westy?
&gt;Have you done it?  What is approximate cost?

        I bought my van a couple months ago now, and it came with the back
windows tinted. The PO had simply installed that roll on tinting you buy at
any old FLAPS. It works great, and keeps the temp down quite a bit when the
sun comes up in the morning.
        The only complaints I have about it are that after a while it
easily gets knicks and scratches on it, and there are some places where it
did not roll on perfectly, creating fairly small harmless air pockets.
        The roll on stuff works and is cheap. Actually I think I will be
taking off all the old stuff and putting on some new stuff, to see if I can
make it look a tad better.

my $0.02
