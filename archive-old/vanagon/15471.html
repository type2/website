&gt; don't get me wrong, i'd really like one of these racks, i like vintage look
&gt; as much as the next person, but don't know that i could justify spending
&gt; $400 on a roofrack that can carry less weight than a yakima or thule (which
&gt; can be had for a fraction of the price). ANybody else have an opinion on
&gt; this one?
&gt; 
I got a 2/3 length old aftermarket all-metal rack made out of steel
tubing. I got it at a swap meet for $50.00, and have seen similar for
under $100.00. Although true enough, it is not stock, but if coated
prperly it will not rot, and can certainly carry several hundred
pounds...
