&gt; an engine from one bus in the body of another. The body has 57K
&gt; miles. Don't know about the engine yet bet I'll find out. It's a VW
&gt; repair shop that did the work and is selling it. Good tight steering,
&gt; good brakes and clutch. The motor looked fairly clean, not a lot of
&gt; oil around, but it needs a new rubber  seal. I didn't see any sign

Big red flag #1! Do the compression test. If it's missing the seal and 
sitting at a garage, be suspicious. My2Cents 8) Joe
