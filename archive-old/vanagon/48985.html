Subject: RE: '89 syncro

&gt;&gt; we have just purchased an '89 syncro gl.  we want to do some conversions 
for
&gt;&gt; camping.   does anyone have any good ideas?  are there catalogs that sell
&gt;&gt; equipment?  we also want a manual.  if this isn't the correct way to post a
&gt;&gt; message please let us know at our e-mail address TkJa_at_aol_dot_com

Z Products, (503) 682-1267, makes curtain kits, bed kits, kitchenette module 
etc. to upgrade your Vanagon for camping.  Their stuff is $$$ but it's 
extremely well made.  I had the bed kit and the curtain kit.  The bed kit 
takes a while to install but it's well worth the effort.  I did not get their 
optional mattress for $200 though.
