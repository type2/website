Brian,

I bought a $10 submersible bilge pump from WalMart.  It is larger than
the one mentioned in the archives, they no longer sell the smaller size.
It pumps 360 gph which is a lot more than the original and probably more
than needed.  It also has a larger output tube than the one mentioned in
the archives, I had to purchase a small step-down PVC adapter at a
hardware store for about 50 cents and glued in inside the tube from the
pump and then clamped it to the hose out of the tank.  So far it works
great.  I have seen one in the JC Whitney catalog that looks like the
same size of the original, for $19.95 I believe, you might want to give
it a try.
