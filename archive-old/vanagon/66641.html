Greg,

How much did the new keys cost?
 I have found it very easy and cheap to aquire old lock slugs and make
the locks match in several VWS.  There are about 5-6 different brass
slugs that make up all of the lock combinations.  In a pinch you can
file the slugs to fit.  This is not suggested, but it works.
 The last key I had made cost me $75.  I got ten lock for $10 from the
salvage yard.  They don't mind selling the broken ones cheap.  Each lock
has 5-6 slugs. With 60 slugs I have fixed several golfs, jettas, and
Vanagons. It is easy, but greasy work.

Drop me a note if you want more info.
or call 1-800-264-6757
