Subject: Diesel van availability

I recently joined this list. Though I have been car free since late 1990,
my first car was a used 1982 Vanagon L Diesel. Aside from a bunch of fairly
minor problems it seemed to work well. I don't think a tank ever averaged
less than 30 MPG and the best run was 38 MPG, usually 32-33 average. It was
very slow but fast enough. I thought the worst aspect of it was the
relatively low top gear on the 4 speed resulting in high RPMs and lots of
noise on the highway. I put taller cross section rear tyres on 200
something x 14&quot; and this helped a bit.

I am now finding a need to haul lots of recumbent bicycles around so I am
thinking of buying another. I have the following questions for the list:

1. Know of any diesel Vanagons for sale, preferably in California?

2. Was 1982 the only year diesel versions were officially imported?

3. Were any 5 speed diesels imported?

4. Does anyone know of any turbodiesel Transporters, Vanagons, Caravelles,
Eurovans, or LTs in North America?

The ultimate combination would be finding a turbodiesel 5 speed 9 seat
version. I'd take the back seats out so I'd like to be able to carry 3 up
front. Would prefer a mid 1980s vintage in terms of price. A Transporter
without side windows would be fine also.

Also just from reading these posts I wonder if the waterboxer engines are
really as unreliable as they sound. I never had any engine troubles with
the diesel, just minor accessory failures such as the electrical system,
muffler, a CV joint, and cooling system. I have basically ruled the
waterboxer versions out from what I have read so far.
