Subject: Wretched Excess (engine conversions)

For those of you want to get a few moments of respectful quiet out of
Steve Maher and myself, I saw just the thing today ata Porsche swap meet
in Princeton NJ.  Bruce Abbott (3012-378-6139) is selling an 84 Corvette
V8 all set up for installation in a Porsche 911.  Which based on my 
experience means it would drop right in to a waterpumper Vanagon with
the deck raised a little.

Laughter turns to pensive looks when he mentions the price:   $1500.
Engine has 4x,000 miles on it.  Comes with all you need except the
right flywheel; it's got the adapter flywheel for Porsche, rather than
Vanagon.

Oh, sorry -- phone number is 302-378-6139.  Don't know where that is,
but you can drive to NJ from there, obviously.  Abbott is pretty well
known in parting-out-old-Porsches circles.

I would love to hear, or even hear about, a V8anagon.
