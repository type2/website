&gt; So people go to a junkyard to get the tank.  Well in a junkyard they
&gt; typically move the vehicles around with forklifts.  Well when they lift
&gt; Vanagons with forklifts, they tend to dent up the gas tank on the bottom.
&gt; 
&gt; If they dent up the gas tank on the bottom on the driver's side, then the
&gt; travel of the fuel guage sending unit can be restricted.

	Not the probelm on my '91 Westy...the tank bottom is exactly the same 
	shape as our '91 VanagonCarat.

&gt; I have gotten into the habit though of keeping a logbook for the Vanagon
&gt; and so reset the trip meter every time I fill up with gas.  This way I can
&gt; keep a running total of gas mileage.  Using the trip meter like this also
&gt; helps me avoid running out of gas.

	As I said in my original note, this is StandardOperatingProcedure, SOP,
for 
	ALL my vehicles.

	Thanks for the helpful suggestions, anyway.
