Subject: Dam for sale



Anybody want to buy a dam for yer vanagon? Looks good, pushes cats and
dogs out of the way. Bolts on easily to existing holes, and comes with the
side/wraparound bits.

Interested parties can e-mail their bids to me: ui775_at_freenet.victoria.bc_dot_ca

Alistair

p.s. not approved for off-road or deep snow.
