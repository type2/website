Volks,
	On January 2nd, DaBoat ('73 Safare Custom Camper) passed the
California smog check.  Here are the results:

			Measured			Allowed
-------------------------------------------------
HC (ppm)	77					350
CO (%)		4.21				6.5
CO2 (%)		12.3
O2 (%)		0.2

Engine RPM 1060		Timing 5 degrees ATDC

A couple of noteworthy things.

The engine had 400 miles on it at the time of the check (has 1800 now).

My bus does not have a &quot;California sticker&quot; or whatever that thing is,
in the engine compartment.  I take it to mean my bus was not originally
sold in California, and that one of the PO's must have paid the &quot;Smog
Impact Fee&quot; on my bus sometime in the past.  The good thing about this
is that my bus doesn't need to have all of the equipment that California
required for a 73 bus - only what was required for a &quot;49 state&quot; vehicle.
Or so my smog guy has been telling me for the past 5 years.
The visual check only listed the following things to check for:

PCV System
Fuel Evaporative Controls
Ignition Spark Controls (i.e. vacuum advance/retard on distributor)
Carburetor (i.e. stock dual carbs)

The strange thing about this is that the bus *had* all of the california
smog equipment on it (egr, smog pump) when I got it!  All of it has
since been removed by me.  Judging by the numbers above, it hasn't hurt
emissions much, and it runs better.

Also, the smog mechanic assumed it was a 1700, when in fact it is a
2000, and the jets in the carbs were from the '72 carbs (richer) but I
guess that doesn't effect emissions at idle much or at all.

I guess my point is that there appears to be a lot of leeway in the
emissions requirements for 1973 busses, and one shouldn't have to worry
much about passing if their engine is running right, even if the motor
is non-stock.  People (even VW mechanics) tell me that the 72-74 busses
are horribly difficult to get to pass smog, and that the carbs are
terrible, but that hasn't been my experience.
