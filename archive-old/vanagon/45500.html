Subject: Re: Review of Bus Boys

I ordered some small parts from them last Monday.  Jim was helpful.  Said
that I'd have them on Friday.  I had them on Friday.  So, I guess if you
want to BUY something the guys at Bus Boys are responsive and provide good
service.

TTFN,
Bo

&gt;Great service? Debatable. Two months and counting on catalog delivery. Would
&gt;I trust them if I needed something immediately? No.
