Hey volks!

Just a quick note no let you all know I landed a job at UBC as a research 
co-ordinator on an AIDS project in the Dept of Health Care and 
Epidemiology there.  Cool!

They're going to pay me!  I'm rich!  I'm... well, not rich, and... I 
can't go up to the hotsprings whenever i feel like it...  and I can't 
just take a afternoon to cruise junkyards...  oh, poo!  I hate work!

But hey, I gave me time off for the Inuvik trip!  (I insisted on it!  
Wouldn't accept the offer until they gave me the time, heh, heh.)

ObVW: I can actually afford to do some overdue repairs and have $$$ for 
the Inuvik trip!  Hmmm... maybe I'll take a second look at taking the 
ferry for part of it...

Tobin
