Subject: Re: Fids

Bob,
	Fids is good!  I think that square rigged ships are great.  The 
technology of joining/splicing lines(not ropes, land lovers) reminds me 
of when I was a crane operator in Detroit.  I almost lost a thumb trying 
to splice some uncooperative cable.  Using a piece of brad or wire in a 
nail knot on the end of a weight forward fly line, is about as close as I 
get to a fid now a days.  Man, we are naked without a basic knowledge of 
knots.  I sometimes burn wine corks,and other such servers for heat.  
Usually, I toss them into the garden, mulch, if I cannot make it over the 
neighbours fence(joking).  I risk my family's safety by replacing a 
pressure cooker's fuse with a piece of garden cork and so on.  It may be 
a gender thing about male need/anxity about unstuffed holes.  What do you 
think, Bob?  Gary Gibson
