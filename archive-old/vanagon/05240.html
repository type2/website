Something...)
So, then, Steven says:

&gt;Anyway, you're an Aggie eh?  You scum  ;)

Hey!!  I resemble that! :-)

I am not having a good morning... so far I've been (variously) described
as: &quot;silent smugness&quot;, &quot;cheap&quot; (albeit indirectly), and &quot;scum.&quot;  :-)  :-)

If I may add my $0.02 worth, I have to say that this is a really cool
list in that it has a very good mix in format, much like a well laid
out magazine, with tech tips, features, gossip, ads, centerfol...(whoops!,
sorry, wrong rag!), etc.  Oh, yeah, I can't forget the humor (which I look
forward to, myself)  Humor is a must when working on some VWs!

Like Mike W. said, if this were a huge list, like Porschephiles, you'd
&quot;lose track of everything, get frustrated and unsubscribe&quot; and then where
would you be? (when something goes &quot;bump in the night&quot; (or on a dark road))
How *DO* you handle Porschephiles, Thom?.....

BTW, Pete, you *were* joking around, weren't you?  I noticed Unka Joel's
smileys, but I don't think I saw yours, and I wouldn't want for there to
be a miscomm. (because we'd be down to 7 '93 EV's and Ric would have to
double his coffee intake to make up for you  :-) :-) ).

One last thing, Steven's advice on wrecking yards is right on; it's
really amazing what you'll find wandering through &quot;junk.&quot; 
And the price is right.

Norman
