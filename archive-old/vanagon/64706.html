Subject:      Fuel tank leaks

I just wanted to report to the group a success! My fuel tank no longer leaks
when full. But let me tell you, it is not a fun time doing the repair.

I went to the dealer (who knew the parts to replace from memory - if that
tells you anything) to get the parts.  I wanted to replace everything if I
were going to the effort of pulling the tank, so about $45 later I left with
 4 seals the crossover vent tube. The parts guy suggested using a
transmission jack to raise and lower the tank.

Well, let me tell you, dropping the tank is not the problem so much as how VW
chose to route the vent tubes and the general lack of clearance. It also
gives you a chance to find out first hand how much dirt collects in the
valley in the middle of the tank. Usually while on your back wrestling the
tank out and looking up. (wear goggles)

I also replaced the cloth covered hoses to the vent tanks with fuel-injection
hose and replaced all the clamps with fuel-injection clamps. (Being
determined to erradicate all leaks.)

The worst part was putting the tank back in because you have to route the
crossover vent tube OVER all sorts of plumbing, wires and cables. I am
convinced that black-forrest elves with long, thin arms did this job at the
factory.

It was an interesting way to spend a day. It took me two days to get the
courage to fill the tank up - because I would have gone insane at the thought
of having to do it again if it still leaked. So far - no leaks!!

For those of you considering it, it is not a job for someome without long
arms and patience. &lt;g&gt;
