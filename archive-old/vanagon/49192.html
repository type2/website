Subject: 84 westy - height?


I've got to start a new job next week and the parking lot is underground. 
This is a good thing during Canadian winters!

However, as a veteran of several close calls, I am going to scope out the 
clearances BEFORE I drive on in. I've had too many parking lot attendants 
who need corrective lenses assure me that there is &quot;plenty of room&quot;

Needless to say I need a new skylight/vent to replace the 
cracked/gouged/scratched current one.

Question is: how high is the westy in total? Feet &amp; inches or meters &amp; 
centimeters would be fine.

The Bentley gives dimensions for everything but overall height.

TIA
