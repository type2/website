Subject: RE: WHAT'S  GOING ON? (With bus prices?)


_______________________________________________________________________________

Well, my brother is getting another 15-window deluxe. (To add to his
`59 23-window I guess.) for putting a clutch in a `76 bus. I'm getting
a `71 westy for 50$. Are these prices comparable to other parts of the
country, or are we just 2 lucky bastards?

  YES, YOU'RE A COUPLE OF LUCKY BASTARDS!!!!!!!! Insist that your
  brother doesn't need ANOTHER classic bus. He should sell it to me.
  that would hasten divorce proceedings on this end...
