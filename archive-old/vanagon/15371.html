Subject: Re: Nice Bus, the book

hey sean,
i already filled out the form.  i am ben wechsler's sister's boyfriend.  ben
goes to princeton, he got me the application.  anyway thought of a bit of
trivia, in the movie &quot;delta force&quot; (i think that is the title) chuck norris is
in a vicious chase scene.  the good guys are driving a bus through a middle
eastern town, up and down large stone flights of stairs, through marketplace
stands, etc.  of course chuck is firing a machine gun out of the sliding door
at the pursuing evil palestinian jeeps.
oh yeah. dont forget the classic palestinians in the bus that kill doc brown
in back to the future then crash into or blow up a fotomat, or something like
that.
