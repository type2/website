&gt;They won't admit it but in 1985 or so the Federal trade Commission 
&gt;mandated that VW fix the heads    thru the BBB autoline  you could get the 
&gt;heads done if lucky V W paid 100%  or at least pro rated the repair based 
&gt;on mileage but they did'nt advertise the program   you had to find out 
&gt;about it on your own and then you had to have all your repairs done by a 
&gt;dealer so that the records would be in VW kaputer 
&gt;I used the program twice as my heads go every 35,000 miles BUT the program
&gt;ended in May of this year  

It's only March.  Are you saying the program's on for two more months?
