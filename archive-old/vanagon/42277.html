specifically when he is running at higher rpms, the engine seems

Paul,
	I had this problem with my 1981 Westy Vanagon when I first 
bought it. It was the main reason I was able to purchase it for only 
$900 2 years ago. It took a little detective work but it turned out to 
be a bad ground on the chassis directly under the battery area. Every 
second or third time I drove the vehicle the ground was not good. To 
explain the &quot;surging&quot;, &quot;kick-out&quot; or as I called it &quot;cutting out&quot; 
simply, at high RPMs the alternator was not putting out enough amps 
for the fuel injection gear. When the problem was occurring to my 
van, it would happen at high RPMs in any gear. I was able to continue 
driving by shifting sooner or by turning off all accessories (radio, 
lights, etc.).
	If it isn't happening every time he drives the vehicle- he can 
tell when it will happen. After starting the van turn on the battery 
meter light below the sink. It should be green at idle. Turn on the 
lights and radio. If the light goes to yellow or red you have a problem. 
Either your alternator isn't putting out enough current or like me, you 
have a bad ground somewhere. This is a low tech way of testing your 
charging system.
	Good luck - I hope it turns out to be as easy for him to fix the 
problem.
