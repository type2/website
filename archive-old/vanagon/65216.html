Todd -

Try a marine supply catalog or store for
this kind of hardware.  Just don't go overboard
and replace everything with stainless!
Even if you can't find an exact replacement
they'll have something similar.

My luggage rack (front of the poptop) is missing one of the chrome metal
tie-down hooks. (They are pop-riveted into the top) I asked about
getting one
from the dealer, but everyone in the parts room just laughed. The parts
guy
finally said, after wiping the tears from his eyes, that he would not
even
bother to look it up because it would cost so much, because of shipping
and
handling, that I'd never be willing to pay the outragous price VW wanted
for
it.

So, does anyone on the list have any ideas? Or one of these lying around
that
they do not want?
