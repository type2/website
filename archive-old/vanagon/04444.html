&gt;When I changed tires about 10 months ago, I called VWOA. The &quot;consultant&quot; or
&gt;whatever told me they recommended the Michelin MXLs even though they were
&gt;205s. He said they felt they handled better. I haven't seen anything saying
&gt;they aren't all weather though. They got us through the &quot;Great Snow&quot; this last
&gt;winter. Oh, BTW Joel... the MXLs are 6 ply (I remembered there was a Q in your
&gt;mind earlier). Anyway, I went with the MXLs and they feel GOOD. They have also
&gt;taken The Enterprise (our bus) where no one has gone before :-) Sorry... HAD
&gt;to do that!

ok. then it was the MXV's that were so bad ... and they were NOT 6-ply. the
ones that came on 91 bus with the alloy wheels and were 205 tires were good
tires (the reinforced sidewalls). cause i was skittish about MX? tires, i
took the 91 bus out in the rain on a deserted highway and panic stopped the
hell out of it: no problems.

but those MX? that were NOT reinforced were really really really bad on my
86 bus. they hydroplanned in anything other than a sprinkling rain, and
especially on a down-slope with run-off water running on the pavement. they
just didn't have any ability to get the water out from under the tread.

so then it is MXV that are crap.

and MXL's are ok, good tires.

sigh. it's a hard life when your mind starts playing tricks on you. it was
bad enough when only your friends did it! ;)
