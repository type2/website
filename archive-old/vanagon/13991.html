YAHHHH!  What a bummer, Chris!  
These kind of stories make me very nervous, as I approach the end of
a similar rebuild myself.  I have already convinced myself (with
some influence from my wife) that if something like this happens to
me, I'm just gonna buy a rebuilt engine!
Chris, you seem remarkably poised and in control about the whole thing.
I would be too fried to type!
