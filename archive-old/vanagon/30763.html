Subject: Water in my cooling system


A couple of years ago I was oozing my way across the Rancho Sante Fe ford
when a bozo in a Land Cruiser surfs past going the other way throwing up a
bow-wave higher than my windshield.  The air scoops on my '65 bus did what
comes naturally, gulping about fifty gallons of water into the engine
compartment.  I immediately went blind.

The blower sucked in the water, fed some of it to the heat exchangers where
it was instantly converted to steam that was blown onto my rain-chilled
windscreen.

The engine never faultered and I was able to keep the bus on the paved
portion of the ford but it took more than ten minutes for the bus to stop
blowing steam.  To help the process along I opened both wind wings and keep
the revs up.  I was on the shoulder of the road by that time and several cars
braked frantically as they approached me, apparently put off by the plumes of
steam blowing out each side of the bus.

The Rancho Sante Fe ford is now crossed by a bridge, robbing me of one of the
joys of winter-time California driving.  When the depth of water at ford
reached a certain height they closed the road to keep the cars from being
swept away, but the VW bus is a remarkable mudder, able to chugg across the
ford with the water almost up to the doors.
