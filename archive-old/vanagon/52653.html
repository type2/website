Subject: Engine blown...

'85 Vanagon blues -

Her tale of woe,
fiddling with the radio,
3rd gear at 6000 rpm,
do I need to shift again?
what's that clanking sound
that's getting louder all around?
then there is a bang and a cloud of smoke,
perhaps this is no joke?
lets stop the car and take a look,
why, that is oil pouring out underneath,
the towtruck number is in the book.
Hun, can you fix my car,
I didn't want to go very far...


We like our car, but...
Is there a market in used engines, or is it salvage time for the old beast?

Any suggestions appreciated,
Mark
