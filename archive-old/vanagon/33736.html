Subject: RE: WD40


&gt;I met a guy at Manderfield Reservoir in Utah (anybody else know where that
&gt;is?  I think I'm probably the only one that ever drove a splittie up
&gt;there!), while I was fishing years back.  We weren't catching anything,
&gt;while he pulled all kinds of fish (well, trout, actually) out of the water.
&gt;As he was leaving, he suggested I try spraying the worms with WD-40.
&gt;Didn't have any with me, so I couldn't.
&gt;
&gt;??????

&gt;Okay, so it's a tad off topic!

MANDERFIELD RESERVOIR! I bet it was my brother in law he swears by WD40 
 on lures and bait. I have heard this from a number of folks but have 
 never tried it.
WD40 developed by NASA, tested in Turkish prisons, and proven by 
 anglers world wide.
