Subject: Re: Recommendation on Slick 50 

&gt; 
&gt; I was at the Sydney Motor Show on Wednesday and a man on the Slick 50 stand 
&gt; impressed me with his display of engines parts that had survived extreme 
&gt; overheating because they had the Slick 50 treatment.
I used slick 50 on a rebuild that had its crank split into two pieces 
after 15,000.  the case was not bored and bearings were measured 
correctly.  No explaination was found.  When talking to a friend who is 
a mechanic he said he replace 4 engines over the past year, the only 
replacements he did, and they all used slick 50.  he didn't recommend it 
at all.  Coincidence or not, I don't know, but I figure engines have run 
100,000 to 200,000 mi with out it,
