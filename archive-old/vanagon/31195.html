Subject: Door and Hatch Seals for 80 Vgon?


This may have been hashed over on this list-- forgive me...

Does anyone have an inexpensive source for the rubber (?) seals that
go around the doors, sliding door, and rear hatch of a 1980 Vanagon?

Or, has anyone ever found a substitute that has sealed well, and not
fallen off the next time you opened the doors?
