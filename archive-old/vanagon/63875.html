Subject: Trip and spares 80 westy


Greeting all,

well the maiden voyage of my recently purchased '80 westy will commence
tues, aug 19  from philly, pa area to falmouth, cape cod, ma.

i am hoping more experienced VW travellers (air cooled vanagons in
particular) can suggest spares, tools, etc... that would be good to have.

thanks
