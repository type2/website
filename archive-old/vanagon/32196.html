Subject: What does a bad ground in the tail light mean? what do I do?

Besides my 84 boxer having a lot of engine noise in my stereo.  I guess I
have a ground problem in the eletrical circuit of the tail lights.  I
finally replaced all my bulbs that were out on all my lights.
Now when I turn on my left blinker it bleeds off into one of the other bulbs
in that left rear housing and makes it blink dimmly.  When I turn on my
right blinker without my head lights on they work fine.  When I turn on my
headlights, both the right rear blinker and RR driving lights come on and
keeps my right blinker from working.  
I was told the check the grounds in my tail lights.  
Where do I check and how do I fix it?
Thanks for the help.
Fred

&quot;Looks like I'm fixing my Van-a-gon.&quot;
