for those who take trips in the winter ...
(with apologies to Robert W. Service)

Strange tales are told, 'bout the winter's cold,
In Volkswagen buses so true;
When the wind's fierce howl drowns the tranny's growl
And there ain't enough heat for you.

When that very same wind is trying to bend
The steering wheel out of your hand
And your muscles ache when you step on the brake
To slow the Velocity Van.

With the numbness spread from your butt to your head
Cause the feeling's gone out of your toes,
And you're wondering where, in that junk pile back there,
Were those warmer and woolier clothes.

For the thousandth time, you recite the rhyme
And the reason that caused you to go
On this journey through land made white, dead, and bland
By the hands of ol' Winter and Snow.

But you arrive there on time, in the arctic-like clime,
And relate to them all of the pain
Of the bone-chilling cold, and the driver so bold
To have beaten ol' Winter again.

Through the window you stare at the bus parked out there,
Covered now all over with snow;
And next time, for sure, you swear now to cure
Those heater boxes down there below!

(from The Buses of Sam McGee,
by Robert W. Service-Dept.)
