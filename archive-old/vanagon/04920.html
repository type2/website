Well, I think I'd go for the most expensive car in the world (so to speak),
and it's electric (eco-friendly).

I think only two were ever made.  I want the one that's proven to go
off-road and off-planet.  That's right, I want the moon-buggy that's
sitting up there passing above our heads (at least once a day).

I'd volunteer to go on the mission to retrieve it!

I wonder how many air-cooled VWs you could buy with the cost of

A. building the moon buggy
B. putting the moon buggy on the Moon
C. retrieving the moon buggy.

Probably, all the air-cooled VWs in existence!
