 Hi,
	Information about Oettinger.

&gt; As many know, Oettinger is the big aftermarket VW company that makes the big
&gt; 6 cylinder motors for the Vanagon, and tons of other Vanagon related goodies.

 But not as big as they used to be. Oettinger went bust in March 1992. The
current company was formed in November 1992 and employs only a handful of
people (still has access to the old stock, though).

&gt; 		     ...The quality, and cost, of Oettinger parts is so high it
&gt; is almost silly to call Oettinger an aftermarket company. VW, when they
&gt; wanted a 6 motor for Vanagon, turned to Oettinger to make the design.

 ? The way I heard it, Oettinger bought the unfinished project from VW and then
finished it off themselves. I'm not confident of the source of this information
though. I believe the parts to build a watercooled six are still around, and
presumably available, though. I wouldn't like to think about the cost.

Cheers,
        W.
