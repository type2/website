no, but hanging a bunch of metal pipes outside and letting the wind bang

yup. it's a well-known fact of Lay Medicine (i.e., Root Cellar Surgery)
that eating mushrooms (of any kind) causes brain farts.

and what, you may ask, is a brain fart? it's when you get up to go into
another room to get something, but as soon as you walk through the door,
you can't recall why you came into the room. it's when you do something
and instantly realize that you knew better than to do that. just a little
involuntary expulsion of brain waves. :)
