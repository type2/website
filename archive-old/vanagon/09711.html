&gt;I have a similar problem.  My problem is in 1st.
&gt;They tell me that it might be bushings in the shift linkage, the clutch
&gt;thrust bearing, or the slave cylinder.  A while back, I bled the hydralic
&gt;lines to the clutch which solved my problems for a while.  I now have a
&gt;rebuilt slave cylinder also.  However, I still have problems with shifting.
&gt;My guess is this: try bleeding your lines and double clutching for a while.
&gt;It might get better with warm temps, or it might not.  If it does not,
&gt;it sounds like it is going to be expensive and inside the transmission.

for the 1st gear folks, there was a 'problem' that could be corrected by
replacing that metal box that bolts to the underside of the floor ... you
have to get to it from where the spare tire is.  it had a revised stop-piece
that rearranged something. anyway, i put it on my 80 bus and it helped.

i don't recall when they put it into normal production, but it might be
worth checking on (before you start rooting around inside the transmission).
