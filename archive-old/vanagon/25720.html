I noticed ad in the local AutoTrader last night for an immmaculate '87 Westy
with 28,300 original miles. Purported old man original owner selling. Price
$18,500. I can get phone if anyone is really interested. Honestly, I was
broke to the point that I didn't buy it. Will have to go back to 7-11 to get
the #. Phoenix, AZ
