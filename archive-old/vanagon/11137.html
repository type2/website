I'd love to help you, Harmon, but my brain gets lost in your mind-wretching sig 
at the end of your note. I feel like I'm in hell, trying to count the teeth of a
spinning flywheel, with a drunk gunning the throttle for all eternity....

P.S. I've had the same Type I experience. Maybe your words of wisdom hold true 
with the Type IV's: &quot;All is impermanent...&quot;

&gt; I just crawled out from under my van -- the '81 2 liter I'm putting in
&gt; it doesn't seem to fit. Oh, it goes in, the tran shaft meshes with the
&gt; clutch splines, etc. Then when I try to tighten up the four mounting
&gt; bolts, and it gets down to the last 1/2&quot;, something is binding. I've
&gt; done many a transplant -- but nothing with this new an engine. What it
&gt; reminds me of is when I tried to put a 1600cc in a 1200cc bug. The
&gt; flywheel was just a bit too big, and you had to grind out the inside
&gt; of the transaxle clutch housing --- is that what the problem is here?
&gt; Does anyone know if they made the flywheel bigger between the 1700cc
&gt; and the '81 2000cc??? I hate to pull it all out to look.
&gt;    Or is there some other difference I'm missing? Surely someone has
&gt; done this before. Please e-mail me as I read the list on the web.

&gt; All is impermanent -- but this too shall pass away, and the way of the
&gt; Samurai is death, so speak your mind now, or forever hold your peace.
&gt;  
&gt; The fundamental delusion of humanity is that I am in here, and you
&gt; are out there.
