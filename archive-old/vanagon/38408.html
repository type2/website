Subject: FS: bus parts

I am in the process of stripping a '76 bus and a '78 sunroof bus 
w/AC. (Both have rust and bad motors.) In a week, what's left will 
go to the crusher.  If anyone wants to buy any parts at a 
reasonable price, please e-mail me with needs so I can pull those 
parts before the busses become scrap metal.  (Also, I am parting 
out a '77 Westy, but that one won't go to the yard for a couple of 
months.)

Soon to own 2 fewer busses than I do now
