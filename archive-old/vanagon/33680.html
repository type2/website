Dear Friends:

I've been on the list a few weeks, and I'm very impressed by the depth of
information available here, and the genuine sense of community the list has
(and the generous traffic load! ;) )

That said, with all the buses burning to the ground, engine and electrical
problems I've read about, I'd like for list members to tell us why they
stay with VWs -- some more positive messages, for balance.

I was originally attracted to the bus after realizing that a beetle would
be impractical when I grew my family a year or so ago. Checked into the
internet, to see what resources were available, and was amazed at what I
found.

I had thought that a bus purchase would be fairly inexpensive (compared to
new vehicle prices!) and that it would take a steady flow of cash to
maintain -- but it was do-able. Now, I'm not so sure...

4WD would be great, I thought, so why not a Syncro? Not so cheap, those.

Camping's fun too! -- also a premium.

The fun that can be had is still beckoning to me, but economic reality is
trying to put me in a headlock. I'd really appreciate it if someone could
post what it costs them to own a wasserboxer. Insurance costs, oil/gas,
parts/maintenance, etc. I realize there is probably a premium involved
here, since the *bus* is the thing, not necessarily the economy of it, but
I'd still like to know...

Thanks much!

Jim.
Wannabus (I think...)
