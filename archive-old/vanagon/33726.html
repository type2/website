So Bob says:

&gt; One more day.  I reconnected the #3 plug wire and the bus started faster
&gt; than my '91 Jetta ever could.  Idled great until warm and then it started
&gt; the idle fluctuation thing although not as bad as before.  Still have the
&gt; problem holding a fast idle though.  It sort of chokes, pukes, and backfires
&gt; but stabilizes when I get off of the throttle.  Still no power when it's in
&gt; gear, though.  Oh yeah, after it gets hot it won't restart.  This is
&gt; probably due to my poor battery but maybe it's something worse???
&gt; 

Two things:

#1  Check and clean or replace your throttle control switch.  Make sure it's
    adjusted correctly when you put it back in.  While you're working in that
    area, clean the throttle plate and opening.

#2  I'm not sure if this year model has trigger points, but you should check
    and or replace those if you have them.
