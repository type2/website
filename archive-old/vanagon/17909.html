 I've got the same problem on my '70, mainly on the passengers side
 and middle (so that would be the same side as yours?). Its obviously
 been patched over and over for years, but that didn't stop the rust,
 and it started spreading to the chassis members under the cab floor. 

 Now I've got to replace one bit of the chassis, as well as all the 
 patches, and so I'm going to replace half the cab floor and hopefully that 
 will keep the rust away for a reasonable amount of time. 
 
 So all in all, I would go for the floor replacement rather
 than lots of patches, because sooner or later thats what will
 probably need to be done anyway....  :(
