Subject:      85 westy for sale, Albuquerque, NM

Tom, of Roamin' Holiday, is wanting to sell a very-low-miles 1985 Camper GL
... with NO air conditioning (the reason for wanting to sell ... seems that
Yanquis think it's hot down in NM! :) well cared for, kept in a garage, etc.

anyway, any of you Wanabusers who might be interested, call him at
(800) 969-8040, in Albuquerque, New Mexico. &lt;they rent campers for
vacationers&gt;.

joel
