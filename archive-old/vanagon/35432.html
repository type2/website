        Says thorsland_at_bigvax.alfred_dot_edu:
&gt;Since I am a new list member myself I believe that a lot of new members
&gt;may get the idea that old VW busses (and new ones) are not that reliable.
&gt;Hearing everyone's problems can be somewhat discouraging.  So lets hear some
&gt;good news such as how long some of you list member's old high milage busses
&gt;have run without any real problems.  Has anyone out there been able to go
&gt;one year (everyday driving) with a 15 year old or greater, high milage bus
&gt;without any breaksdowns or problems (besides regular maintanence)?  I would
&gt;be interested in the reliability one can get out of these &quot;classics&quot;.

        Says Songie &lt;songie_at_gate_dot_net&gt;:
&gt;Old buses are not reliable but you can't kill them, the worst thing that
&gt;can happen to them is to rust away .
&gt;They are Family! They will do anything for you but you have got to love
&gt;them for what they are.

        I don't know about &quot;not reliable&quot;. Seems to me that a car is only
as unreliable as the work that's been put into it. Don't do anything but
half-fixes to a car for 20 years, and it will become very unreliable. If
you want to buy a vehicle which will be reliable from the get-go, you will
have a hard time finding a older bus which will suit your needs. They are
there, but those who put good care and love into the maintenance of thier
vehicles tend to be loath to let them go. OTOH, if you don't mind putting
in the work yourself, you can make an ok bus *very* reliable, simply by
replacing any components which are seemingly old or in need of repair. My
bus has been fairly reliable for over 2 years/50k miles now, including
moving from Los Angeles to Austin, TX, loaded to the gills. I bought the
bus for $150 in lousy condition, from a junkyard. I've replaced the
engine,tranny and CV joints and the generator/regulator combination. All of
this probably cost me around $1500-2000, give or take. If you buy a bus in
decent, fairly rustless shape, throw in a rebuilt engine, tranny, and maybe
some brake parts, you'll probably have a very reliable vehicle for several
years. Maybe CV's as well, and check the front-end parts for wear. All of
this can be done for considerably less than the purchase price of a new
econo-box. One note: the upright 1600 engine is *not* a Northstar system.
It was purposfully *designed* to need more maintenance, the trade off being
that it was designed so that *you* could do the maintenance. If you do so,
with attention to detail and do the job properly, it will carry you well
and faithfully. If you don't, it won't.
        So what I'm really saying here is: you'll only get out of it what
you put into it. Up front or later, your choice. Which is not only fairly
positive, but works very nicely for life in general as well.

P.S.: You want a reliable bus? Check out one of Bob Hoover's *finished*
products. I'll betcha thery're reliable...

Peace,
