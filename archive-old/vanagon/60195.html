Subject: Vanagon Video

Any of you catch the evening news last night showing the &quot;high-speed&quot; chase
in Minnesota?  The vehicle being pursued was none other than a handsome,
handy, Vana . . .gone!

For those who missed the exciting clip, the bus was ultimately hit broadside
(all visible from the helicopter shot), by a Chevy Blazer, no less, and
forced into an adjacent building.  The occupants of the bus fled but were
caught soon after.

Other than recognizing the hilarity of the &quot;high-speed&quot; moniker, my family
and I all took note that, in spite of the fact the Vanagon was hit hard by
the Blazer, it retained it's box-like shape and appeared to clearly
demonstrate the benefits of its unibody construction.  Anybody else see this
unplanned video testimonial?
