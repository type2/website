Is it Thom who couldn't get his '56 started ?

I was talking to a VW wise-man last night and he
was telling me that his bus wouldn't start when it
was hot - the start wouldn't turn fast after a long
run.

Problem: The wire that operates the solenoid on the
starter apparently decays and causes this problem of
slow started - I don't see how myself.

Solution: Re-run this length of wire or add a starter
switch in the engine may ie. a wire that goes from the
solenoid to the battery via a switch. Use this switch
to control the starter - with the ignition on as well.

I don't have this problem so I can't say whether it
works on not.
