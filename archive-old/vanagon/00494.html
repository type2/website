Subject: RE: Towing capabilities

Regarding the towing capacity of a stick vanagon;  I have a '86 syncro and
have hauled a Coleman pop-up camper across the US (and back!).  The
van did fine; although the Rockie mtns will cause considerable down 
shifting.  Gas mileage was not significantly effected and use of the AC was
OK.  Now headwinds, thats a different story, although thats true without
pulling the trailer.

The loaded trailer is on the oder of 1000 lbs.  Any trailer shop should be
able to provide a hitch.  The bar is almost the full length of the bumper
and uses the tie down hooks (if thats what they are) and several bolts
directly to the bumper.  Go for it,

Kerry
