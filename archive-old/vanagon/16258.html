Subject: Galvanic rust protection, rust repair

	VW uses zinc gasket/washers between the front fenders and the
unibody on the waterpumpers- A1 and up. 
	I've noticed there are two bright 'silvery' metal bolts that
don't seem to do anything in the leading edge of my Corrado's
door. They COULD be adjustments of some kind- the 914's door-window
channel was ADJUSTABLE for tilt by a nut-and-screw business a lot like
a rocker adjuster at the bottom of the door...
	Or those bolts could be sacrificial electrodes. I should
ask the parts guys.
	A sacrificial electrode on my single-cab would be a good
deal... I'm going to look into it.

	Over the weekend, my gentleman neighbor, Bill, cut out the
rusted through parts of my '70's battery tray and cleaned up the
weld-through where DFO (Dread Former Owner) or someone had re-wire-welded
the air-cleaner support. He said the biggest problem was that the
rust had thinned the metal around the holes, so that when he put
heat on them, they got bigger! But the starboard rear inner fender is
now solid again. And for a bag of sand, he'll sand blast the area.
	Ian says I should then shoot an etching primer for clean metal
over it- he says Eastwood just came out with an aerosol. Call 'em
later today.

	Bill got burned on one finger from melted tar undercoat that
dripped. I owe him big time and plan to start with a nice dinner
for him and his family.

	Incidentally, Bill just picked up the back end of the bus
with his engine hoist- bolted the hoist chain to the outer two holes
where the apron between the engine and bumper mounts, and just lifted it
high enough to put hefty supports under the rear wheels! 30 degrees nose
down!

	I still haven't seen the battery tray repair part from Mill Supply,
but I expect it to arrive any day now. (A package from New Hampsire, shipped
UPS, took from the 6th to the 14th to make the journey earlier this month,
so I guess UPS cross-country is now a two week affair. USPS can beat that
for not too much more money.

	We're going to do the brake system tonight!
