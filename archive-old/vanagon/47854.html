Subject: Broken armrest and oil pressure warning light in 89 Westy

My armrest broke off about two years ago. I fix it and it falls off every
six months since, i have called about half of the junkyards on the list
that Ron Van Ness posted in Aug 95 and have not had any luck.  any hints a
as to where i could locate one.  The dealer wants 120.00.  Also my oil
pressure warning light/buzzer has been going off when i pull off the
interstate.  I can hit the dash and it goes off, or it will go off in
amatter of seconds.  Is this the circuit board?  Oil pressure is fine. 
Thanks for any help is appreciated.
Jeff
89 Westfalia
