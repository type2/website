Subject: Re: Is this normal? (1977 camper advice)

&gt;David says he cleans the screen and I can't argue with him too much.  OTOH,
&gt;I don't.  I have always figured that if the filter didn't catch it the
&gt;screen sure won't.  David, counter please?  You might talk me into changing
&gt;my habits.

All I can offer is that sometimes I do find debris in the screen.  Usually
looks like small pieces of gasket material and other unidentifiable stuff.
If you found any metal in there, it could serve as an early warning for
engine trouble whereas most of us don't cut open our oil filters to see
what they caught...
