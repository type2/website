&gt; Now my question. The driver's vent window will not stay
&gt; open, pushed about 75 degrees to let a nice breeze in, at
&gt; highway speeds. On Prince Edward Island this occurred. We
&gt; were cruising along and plop, it closed. I can't seem to
&gt; find any adjustment or other means of tightening it down.
&gt; I bus, therefore I am

Glad you were able to solve your problem(s) with the O2 and
Idle Solenoid...something to watch out for with my 84.

The vent window is *tightened* via pressure between two
*plates* held together by a phillips head screw which is
only reachable after you remove the interior panel and
probably peel back the plastic stuck to the inside of the
door.  I had to do the same thing to my 84 several years
ago.  Need to do it again now...will be sure to put
lock-tite on it this time.

IMO, your 67 (and mine) has a better setup.
