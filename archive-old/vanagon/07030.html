Norman,

The clips I was talking about are the ones that hold the trip pieces
to the sides of the rear facing jump seats in the MV. I'm not sure
if they are the same on the middle seat of a CL or GL.

As to the &quot;free&quot; oil change, I received a coupon from VWUS 
late last spring for a free oil change for owners of 93 VWs.
So when the EV went in for its 24,000 check up, I did the
oil too.
