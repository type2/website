Subject: WTB source for pre 67 door hinge screws

does anyone know a place to get these?  they are a 8x18 countersunk 
ovalhead philips machine screw.  they hold the doors and gates on to the 
body on early bus's.  i need between 20 and 30 of them depending on the 
price.  any help or leads would be greatly apreciated.  i would prefer 
new ones, but excelent used oned will do.
thanks and God BLess
