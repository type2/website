&gt; 
&gt; Thanks you for your cerebrally-challenged diatribe of your recent
&gt; locationally-challenged venture to Idaho with your botanical
&gt; companion. 

Dear Martha,

What?!?  You actually read that stuff?   Whaddya-mean locationally
challenged?  Oh....you mean like the long exciting desert drive
maybe???

&gt;Sounds like you spent a lot of time being
&gt; vertically- and sobriety-deprived.  As an x-chromosome-deficient
&gt; person of mass, you should realize that most of us gyno-americans
&gt; on the list might find your trip report attentionally-disabled,
&gt; and metabolically-problematic with regard to activities such
&gt; as talking cars, hiking, fishing, and other typical subjects
&gt; that living mass persons with testosterone-poisoning find interesting.
&gt; Speaking for other persons of gender, I think we would now all like
&gt; to hear a little more about other parts/subjects of the trip
&gt; which are not quite so electroencephalographically-flat.  Someone
&gt; who is as chronologically-gifted as you, ought to know that
&gt; we fe-persons (womin?) like to hear about things like cooking,
&gt; sewing, shopping, and interior decor of your vanagon.

The decor of my van?  Sheesh, I thought since everyone new what
they looked like stock.  Cooking?  We made fajita's one night. ;)
Potatoes O'Brien (O'Brian?) one morning.  Ate out alot.  Ummmmm
Yea, cooking...yea isn't that where you put something in a pan
and heat it? ;)  Well, maybe next time I'll do better.

Shopping? I bought a real cool McCall Microbrewery shirt.  Oh Yeah
and another shirt in bend with a real cool picture of a snake 
wrapped around a hikers leg that says &quot;Take A Walk On The Wild
Side&quot;.  Oops!  More testosteroni spillage there...;)  Linda picked
up some nice ones too, but a little more tilted toward the well-
X chomozone endowed. :). 

Sewing hmmmm.... that's a tough one.  I'll get back to you on that.

&gt; 
&gt; Altogether, however, I'm glad that as you took this trip while
&gt; being occupationally-deprived, that it was not a total 
&gt; incomplete success!..
&gt; 
&gt; ;)  /martha
&gt; 
&gt; p.s.:  The next time you decide to become in a relatively
&gt; temporarily inert state, it would be interesting to hear
&gt; more about any bouts of directional non-discrimination you
&gt; undergo, and what you find of interest there....
&gt; 

Well Martha, me thinkest that you are spending way too much
time with your theasaurus and should get into your beasties
engine compartment and really find out where it's at!  ;) ;) ;)


Cheers,

Steven
