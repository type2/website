&gt; I just got off the phone 
&gt; &gt;with Snap-On customer direct order line and this is what I heard.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     			Sears 12 point		Snap-On 6 point
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;30mm or 1 3/16&quot;		$8.99			$22.90
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;36mm or 1 7/16&quot;		$10.99			$27.99
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;42mm or 1 11/16&quot;	$13.99			$37.50
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; but I was wondering if 
&gt; &gt;there are alternatives. 
&gt; 
&gt; Swap meets are good, and you can find good deals at fleamarkets.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
I have the solution on this one for sure, HARBOR FREIGHT TOOLS,
somewhere out ther in CA, I can get the address if anyone needs
it, A set of 3/4&quot; drive sockets from 19mm up to 54mm or so is
only $40, including two extensions, ratchet, and slide bar driver.
Had mine for two or three years, and the things are simply incredible
for that occasional need.  Quality is FAIR, large sizes are pretty
rough and plating and casting could be better but for the normal
weekend mechanic, this stuff is so gigantic, you could NEVER, NEVER
break any of it.  I have removed more front drive VW axle nuts than
you can count and removed Bus and Vanagon axle nuts quite a few times
as well with no problem, all are 12 point, I have used a 6 foot pipe
extension on the ratchet to break stubborn Bus axle nuts on a well
rusted '74 parts bus.  Really the price is entirely deceiving, for
the price of a slide bar and one or two sockets at SEARS you get the
entire (must be 15 to 20 piece) set, and you will truthfully never
break one or round a nut on any VW application, I'll gaurantee it,
best $30 I ever spent (on sale then) I have used these in the lab 
on 200,000 pound load frames where I needed to torque 1.25&quot; bolts into
the 400+ foot pound range on occasion with never a problem, one of the best
when you need it you got it occasional tool sets ever.  Might not be
up to day in day out service on you MACK truck otherwise, save your
money.  (Incidently for normal hand tools I'd always go with CRAFTSMAN
at least or better used SNAP-ON but generally HARBOR FREIGHTS stuff is
worth what you pay for it and they got some really interesting
occasional doodad tools that you might not know exist and make life
a lot easier)
