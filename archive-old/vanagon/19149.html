&gt;This reminds me that on the day I joined this list everybody was talking
&gt;about burning magnesium.  I missed out on how all of that got started.  Can
&gt;someone fill me in?  Burning magnesium is most excellent and I'd like to know
&gt;what you guys were all talking about.

Well, uh, we like, uh, get some really cool stuff, y'know, like ta burn,
uh, and like we, uh, burn it? and there are, like really cool colors,
y'know, and if we like put magnesium, like, put it in the, y'know, fire? it
gets really, like, really bright? and it's like cool.
