Subject: aux. battery
Date: Wed, 30 Oct 96 20:32:55 EST

Hello all,
Ah, the infamous auxiliary battery.  I am seriously considering mountin
one in my newly acquired '81 Westy.  I think I know the basics of wiring
it all up, but I need to know what size battery will fit under the
driver's seat.  I seem to remember Group 41 deep cycle batteries work
well.  I suppose I will also want a relay to switch between the aux.
battery powering my accessories when camping and allowing both to charge
when driving.  I intend to have the aux. battery power the over-sink
light, the dome light, the aftermarket reading lamps, the stereo, and
perhaps also the silver socket and cigarette lighter in anticipation of
future accessories.  I imagine that the sink light and the dome light
are both on the same fuse?  Looks like a lot of wiring coming my way.  

So, who's done it and how easy is it?

BTW, how does one tell if the fridge is working on 12v?  I flipped it on
with the engine running but really didn't notice anything happening.  Is
there anything to tell you it's working?  Haven't tried on propane or
120 volt yet.  

All these questions....but as I become more intimately acquainted with
the Westy, I love it more and more.  Once I get this niggly little
problems fixed I'll be much happier.

Sean
