Subject: '96 EV Camper



Went to the local VW dealer today to get a part (the little 
rubber boot that goes over the shift linkage where it 
disappears into the trans, it cost can$17!!!, why? what do 
you do, you're at the parts counter, you need the part, you 
can't think of a substitute, you're pissed, you pay the 
dammed money), and took the opportunity to look over 
the '96 EV camper. Most of you know that at least in 
Canada, the '06 camper is made by Winnebago and not 
Westfalia. It is easily recognized by the pop top which has 
a little luggage &quot;rack&quot; at the front just like most loafs a and 
bricks, and by the lack of driver's side rear window. The 
white model I squinted at in the showroom had its top up 
and the rear hatch open, which was draped in a pseudo 
tent which formed an extra room/shower stall at the rear 
of the van. Inside the van is quite nice. the stove is right 
behind the driver's seat with the sink adjacent and to the 
rear, fridge below plus a quite large storage cupboard. The 
&quot;info panel&quot; below the stove has LEDs for battery charge, 
water level and propane level. Two ac outlets are on this 
panel also. To the rear on the driver's side is a full height 
cupboard. On one edge of the cupboard I noticed a house 
type thermostat and sure enough, below the rear seat on 
the left side are outlets for a propane furnace. The pop top 
has three screened windows and the gas charged struts to 
&quot;keep it up&quot; ( I wonder if there is a locking device or will 
EV owners in the future complain of sagging tops). The 
upper bunk seems much smaller than the vanagon, but 
there is a built in light affixed to the top.
the rest of the van seemed like the Westy version.
The whole interior design was quite tasteful, no wood grain mactac in sight!
Forgot to look at the sticker, but I think I read that it is around can$35K.
