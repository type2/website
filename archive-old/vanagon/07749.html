&gt;Does anyone have or know where we might find a cross reference for
&gt;Vanagon Syncro parts with the Syncro parts from Quantum Syncros and/or
&gt;Audi Quattros?

hmmmm. for those of you with microfiche, you might check the part numbers of
the syncro parts. what i've seen seems to indicate that Vanagon parts, that
is, parts specific to Vanagons, start with 25x-xxx-xxxx. so if the syncro
parts start with something else, it MIGHT be an indication that the parts
are NOT Vanagon specific.  i think i've got a Syncro car fiche at home, so
i'll look and see what i can see tonight. don't have any audi fiche ... the
dealer isn't nearly as nice and accomodating. :(
