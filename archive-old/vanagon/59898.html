&gt;No. your problem is a new static suppressor wire which you need,it=20

&gt;in between you current wire that is plugged into your air mass=20
&gt;box,cost
&gt;should be about 100.00 at your local vw store you will def need it to
&gt;live and operate your van at that altitude, whats happpening is your
&gt;current wire is allowing your computer on board to get false radio
&gt;signals at that altitude,and the new static suppressor has a 5th diode=20
&gt;=3D
&gt;in
&gt;it that grounds out the radio waves, your  van will operate as if it's
&gt;starving for fuel may even quit on you, ,to get you home ,till you can
&gt;get and add that new wire,when it happens ,just pull to the side of=20
&gt;the
&gt;road and stop ,if you haven't already,shut the machine off for=20
&gt;approx.30
&gt;minutes, then start it up and you  should get another hunderd miles
&gt;before reoccurrence,only takes a moment to install new wire yourself,
&gt;then when you reach your perm altitude wait a couple of days and your=20

&gt;van
&gt;brain should adjust itsself to the additional wire,     Good luck,  =20
