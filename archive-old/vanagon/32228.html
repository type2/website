Subject: AOL E-mail problem

To All:

AOL is having a problem with E-mail.  If you were awaiting a reply from me,
do not resend your message -- everything addressed to me since 1-06 is
hung-up in a queue somewhere in AOL.  No estimate on when it will be fixed.  

Sorry to waste the bandwidth on a systems problem.  

-Bob
