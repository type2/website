Subject: Re: Recommendations on Type IV rebuilds

 &lt;snip&gt;I would like comments on what the different 
&gt; suppliers products are like, how reliable? What kind of quality? Any 
&gt; service issues?

Well Clay,
    I bought a re-manned 1800cc from ATK/VEGE and it lasted just under 1000
miles before it completely lost compression on #3 cyl.  I didn't re-check
the torque on the heads (well why the #%_at_$ should I have to, that's what I
gave them $1200. for) When I contacted the rep. he told me that they don't
warranty their engines against broken or melted pistons or rings.  BTW I
wasn't just your average Joe (sorry Joes) calling them about warranty info,
I manage a FLAPS and called them and later spoke in person to their rep. in
that capacity.  I can't recomend anyone good as I didn't try again.  My best
advice is deal with someone close enough that you can go stand on a few
desks if you need to.  And DOUBLE-CHECK everything you can.
                           Good luck,
                              Doug
