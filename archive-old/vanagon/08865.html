List-Owner:

Please excuse my rude commands above, but I am interested in subscribing to
your VW Vanagon discussion list.  It was mentioned in the &quot;rec.autos.vw&quot;
newsgroup, but no information was given about how to subscribe, except for
your email address.

List Members:

If this message appears posted, then I'm sorry.  It was not my intention to
send this to everyone.

Thanks.
