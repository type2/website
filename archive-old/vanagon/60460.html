Subject: Re: Syncro - a love story

&gt;Down in Canyonlands area, I bolted through a snow-melt swollen stream =

&gt;2.5+ ft. deep (I waded it twice and de-rocked my line) to find a Ford =

&gt;F-250 around the bend stalled due to water in his ?motor.

About 5 years ago I sold my '70 VW &quot;Not a Westy&quot; Camper with 320,000 mile=
s
on it to a young couple for way cheap.  It had just worn me out with brea=
kdowns, =

repairs, and it had no rear seat belts for my just arrived kid.  I told t=
hem
everything that I knew was wrong with it and everything that made me nerv=
ous
about it...they told me they were going to break it in on a trip to &lt;gulp=
&gt;
Mexico!  When they got back, &lt;whew&gt; they said they had driven across a =

beach/road in Baja that is only accessible when the tide is out.  Out on =
that =

beach they ran into some 4x4 stuck in the sand, so they towed him loose, =
and =

continued on their way.  Sigh, and to think I was worried about them...
