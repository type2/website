There were just enough comments about the vw van (watch what you say, big bad
mag!) in this Road and Track article that I decided to post it. I deem the
comments to be neutral, on the whole:



Side Glances
BY PETER EGAN

Invasion of the minivans

For a minute there, I thought it had actually happened: All other forms of
vehicle life as we know
it, save the minivan, had ceased to exist.

I was driving my new blue Ford full-size van into Madison, Wisconsin, last
week on Highway 14
and suddenly found myself boxed in, so to speak, by no fewer than four
minivans. They were all
of different brands and colors, though of course all the colors represented
were from that part of
the spectrum between November Raincloud Gray and Maybe-I'll-Just-Shoot-Myself
Leaden
Metallic Blue. We live in tasteful times. There is no joy in paintville.

Looking across to the oncoming lane of the divided highway for relief, I saw
a white Astro van
come over the hill. Eerie. No other kinds of transport were visible on the
road. Luckily, a few
moments later, an actual car appeared--one of the few Ford Torinos left in
existence, flapping its
nearly rusted-off fenders like homemade angel wings at a grade school
Christmas play.

So we motored on down the road, my entourage and I, in a rolling phalanx of
vandom. Sitting
high up in my big Econoline, I felt rather grand, like the captain of a
steamship being guided into
harbor by tugboats. I hummed a few bars of &quot;If my friends could see me now&quot;
and wondered if
Willard Scott were below deck eating shrimp. As the capital dome approached,
my escort
gradually peeled off into traffic filled with even more minivans.

These things were everywhere.

In fact, it occurred to me just last week that of the six couples we
regularly have over for dinner,
five of them now own minivans. In this mix we have an Astro, a 4wd
extended-body Aerostar, a
new-style Dodge Caravan, an older-style Plymouth Voyager and one of the last
air-cooled
Volkswagen Vanagons made. Okay, the Vanagon is not quite a minivan in the
low, carlike vein,
being a little taller and boxier, but it was bought for roughly the same
reasons as the others.

So what does this say about our friends? Good solid middle-class, middle-aged
citizens with a
house, a dog and 2.3 children? The station wagon owners of yesteryear? Yes,
but four of the five
men in these families hold SCCA Competition Licenses, and the Vanagon couple
are semiretired
rock climbers. And three other people I know are using minivans to tow racing
cars. It's enough
to make a demographer step outside for a smoke break. All kinds of people now
own these
things.

No doubt about it: Minivans are a success story.

That they would become so popular was not necessarily an easy prediction.

It was just 11 years ago, in 1983, that the then-Editor of R&amp;T, John Dinkel,
dispatched me to the
introduction of a new, small van built by Chrysler. The intro was just a
one-morning affair, to be
held at a sprawling but gated real estate development (golf, tennis, stables,
lavish homes,
condos, convention center, free ice) called Coto de Caza, south of Los
Angeles in that newly
developed part of Orange County where the Spanish street names, when
translated, mean
&quot;Ocean by the Sea&quot; or &quot;Doubloons of the Sea Gull.&quot;

It was, of course, the introduction of the Plymouth Voyager and the Dodge Cara
van. A fairly low-
key affair as these things go, but informative. We got to drive the vans, and
I remember thinking
they were quite pleasant. Not terribly sporty or quick, powered as they were
by Chrysler's all-
purpose 2.2-liter transverse-4 or the optional and slightly peppier 2.6, but
not as slow and golf-
cartlike as I'd expected.

After our drive, we had a meeting in which the marketing people explained
this new niche. The
key words, they said, were &quot;garageable&quot; and &quot;carlike.&quot; Seemed many people
wanted a van, but
couldn't fit a full-size van into their garages and didn't want to leave them
parked on the street or
in the driveway. They also hesitated to head into a downtown shopping area
with a large van
because of parking problems and blind backing maneuvers. Women, especially,
disliked driving
something that rode, handled and looked like a truck. The world needed a
compact people-
hauler with civility, easy handling and a low step-in floorpan.

Who was going to buy these things?

Everyone, we were told. Young couples, retired couples, car-poolers, resort
owners, fishermen,
flower-shop delivery drivers and people with 2.3 children and a dog.

Then Chrysler's marketing spokesman added what he believed to be another key
element of the
buying public: the Counterculture.

The folks, he said, who had been buying VW microbuses all these years--road
gypsies, Grateful
Dead fans, backpackers, people who lived and camped out of their buses. One
of the marketing
guys told me he wouldn't be surprised if, a few years down the road, we saw
Voyagers and
Caravans with wild paint jobs and beaded curtains in the windows.

I looked at the Caravan nearby and tried to picture Arlo Guthrie and his band
of Thanksgiving
merrymakers cruising into Stockbridge, comfortably ensconced in those
gray-cloth captain's
chairs. Or filling the velour-lined cargo area with trash from Ray and Alice's
 church, only to run
afoul of Officer Obey. It didn't quite fit.

Would Deadheads just naturally gravitate toward the Voyager as their vehicle
of odyssey from
one concert to the other, or would they continue to show up in VW microbuses,
black '51 Chevys
with hooded windshield visors, old panel trucks, mid-Sixties' Cadillac
hearses, pickups from
immediately before and after World War II and Beetles from the unpadded-dash
era? Would Ken
Kesey and his aging Pranksters (or their younger heirs) see the Caravan as
the next obvious
thing? I couldn't picture it.

The new minivans were many things, but they were not funky.

And they still aren't.

What they are is sensible. So sensible, in fact, that many of the people who
used to belong to
that nebulous Counterculture now own them, having (for the time being, at
least) lost interest in
the mechanical uncertainty, Spartan appointments or cramped quarters of their
old cars and
trucks. Let's face it: If you have to haul children and dog food, pick your fo
lks up at the airport,
take friends to dinner or drive 2000 miles to Disneyland, minivans make a lot
of sense.

So do the also popular sport-utility vehicles, of course, but they tend to be
taller, more trucklike
and more expensive. The famous baby boomers are poised, at this moment in
history, between
two generations, the very old and the very young. And both need to be driven
places and be
moved in and out with the least possible difficulty.

Parents of babies and small children look at a car or truck and what they see
is not sheet metal,
tires and glass, but rather a vivid X-ray vision of their vertebrae and back
muscles twisting as
they try to reach the baby seat. Couples with elderly parents envision the
extraction and boosting
maneuvers dictated by low cars and tall trucks. A small, walk-in bus with a
low floor, tall roof,
wide doors and lots of cargo space is just the thing.

Another virtue that has not hurt the minivans is their looks. Starting with
an essentially honest,
utilitarian shape, stylists have continued to improve the contour and balance
of the small vans to
the point where many are among the best-looking shapes on the road, with the
possible
exception of the Chevy Lumina APV--though even that nose-heavy shape has been
smoothed
out somewhat. For better or for worse, most minivans are also gratifyingly ide
ntifiable in a sea of
lozenge-shape cars, which also helps you find the thing in a parking lot.

So, is there any end in sight? Will the current boomers (what an awful name;
I wish we were
called the Lost Generation or something) continue to own and drive these
things when the
children are grown and the folks, sadly, are gone?

Probably. Utility vehicles have a way of getting under your skin, whether
vans, pickups or 4wd
sport trucks. I like driving my Ford van so much that I often use it for
ridiculously light-duty tasks,
such as hauling a new CD home from the music store or stocking up on guitar
picks. The guitar
picks, especially, could probably be conveyed by something smaller than a
1-ton truck with a 460
V-8. Likewise, a couple of my friends with minivans have quietly confessed
that they &quot;actually
like&quot; driving them, so much that they often use them in preference to a
regular car, even when
they don't need the space or utility.

But minivans are, let's face it, just a little bit numb. Just slightly too
padded and comfortable, too
easy and sane and practical. Automotively, they are a little like going to
the Matterhorn in
Anaheim instead of the one in the Alps, or visiting Water World instead of
rafting the Colorado.
And this in a generation that used to backpack, camp in tents and sleep in
the mud at rock
concerts.

In the mixture of life that is honey and salt, as Carl Sandburg would say,
minivans are a little
heavy on the glucose. They will, I predict, stay in our garages because they
are too practical to
give up. But I think in the coming years we'll see them sharing garage space
with an increasing
number of saltier cars, if you will, sports cars both old and new, and cars
with an edge to them--
Morgans, Mustangs, Miatas, Corvettes, Ford Woodies, TR-3s, and so on. Not to
mention '51
Chevys with hooded windshield visors, mid-Sixties' Cadillac hearses, pickups
from immediately
before and after WWII and, of course, VW microbuses.

We can't have Arlo driving around exclusively in an Aerostar, even if he owns
one.
