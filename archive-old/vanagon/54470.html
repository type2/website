Yep, I know caps are yelling, I AM YELLING!

It's about -5 F w/o the wind chill here in Cincinnati, OH. My '83.5 was
sitting out all night defenseless :-(  I came out of this morning about
6am, hoppped in pressed the clutch and shifted to nuetral, started right
up, got out and took the dog to do his daily, came back in about 5 minutes,
hopped back in and NO CLUTCH! Nothing, the pedal went straight to the floor
with no resistance at all! It felt OK prior to starting.

What gives?

Looked at the Bentley and made out 2 different cylinders. I'm assuming one
of these is the problem?

Any advice?
