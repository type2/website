Subject: Re: Questions about club?

Organization?  Here?  Gerry tries but I don't see this as much organized 
- despite numerous attempts.  

For our questioner though....  This is a mail list not a club really.  
Folks trading email comments about basically anything and everything 
about VW vans.  To subscribe (and be sent LOTS of email) 

All requests should be addressed to listserv_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu.

Have the body of the mail consist of only 

 SUBSCRIBE VANAGON &lt;your name&gt;

Suspect others might have helped as well but had to replay when I saw 
&quot;oraganization&quot; applied to this list.  Subscribe and you'll see why...  

Gotta love it here!
