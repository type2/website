Matt,

You may want to try some of the larger auction houses. It seems that the 93 
EVs that were part of VWs lease program are starting to come &quot;off lease&quot;. I 
was at the local VW dealer talking to the sales manager (trying to find a 
hard date the Concept 1 was comming in....no I'm not trading the EV for 1)..

On his desk was a list of VW lease cars going up for auction at the Mannheim 
Auction down in Pennsylvania. There were VWs and Audis of all types, 
including EV CLs, GLs, MVs and Weekenders. Unfortunately there was no info 
as to price, however when I pressed the issue, it seems that auction, EVs 
are going for $11k and up.
