Subject:      vw dealers refuse to work anyting over 10 years ..

do you folks realize that means they will NOT work on any of the air-cooled
buses or cars? the last air-cooled car was the 1983 Vanagon ... 12 years old
now. :(

i get the feeling that the vw dealers are involved in a conspiracy with GM
... those Chevrolet people in the VWOA started it! ... to just be so mean
and rotten, that they run everybody away from VW.

well ... it COULD happen!!! look at all the other marques that have
disappeared from our shores because of lousy dealers and poor parts service
(which brough on poor sales):
MG, Triumph, Peugeot, Renault, Citroen, Opel (another GM fiasco), Fiat,
Yugo (well ... ) ... any others?

kinda odd that they are all euro-brands. are the Japanese too new to the
scene?

remember, gentlemen and ladies: we shall all hang together, or we shall all
hang separately. ;)  &lt;i.e., we are now in the same boat as the Brit folks
... cast adrift by our dealers&gt;.
