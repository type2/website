Derek,

Sorry to respond on the list but I didn't notice your email
adress in your post, I want to make a first bid on any and
all Corrado specific tools, most importantly shift lever
alignment jig, rear brake caliper piston retractor (for all
recent fwd VW's), any trans tools and anything else for recent
fwd VW's that is Corrado related, maybe some Bus stuff as well
Please email me back with your address and I'll be leafing through
the Bentley manual looking for part no's, may be interested in
anything looking like it's for Quantum Synchro's as well.

Most sincerly
John Anderson
