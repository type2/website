Subject: 85 Motor Question

I've got a bid on a factory rebuilt 1.9L of $2495.  A used engine with 
40k on a rebuild is $1700.  That sounds way too high to me.

I've about decided to get rid of my '85 as being too expensive to fix.  
It has 110k and I've been advised that at that mileage it is due for a 
clutch and CV joints and maybe a transmission.  Any thoughts on that?

In searching the archives for other rebuilders, I've not had much luck 
getting addresses and/or phone numbers of reputable firms.  I'd 
appreciate any assistance there if it's not too much trouble.
