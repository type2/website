Subject: not a failing engine mount :)

Hey all,
Well, I guess the strange noise coming from the rear was not a failing engine mount at all but instead it was the air conditioning compressor mount torquing.

I adjusted it today to make the belt a little tighter and it seems to have fixed the problem, i.e. no more weird noise.  I suspected it might have had something to do with me just being under there.

Anyway, in a/c news, we began to charge my compressor with freon today and eventually the compressor decided to squeal and smoke so it appears to be soon dead.  No a/c this summer, I guess.  Well, at least I still have that nifty fan for a nice breeze :) .

I also blocked off the gaping hole in my tin as best I could, seems to be holding together, we'll see how it goes.  I hope it sticks together ok.

Gotta go, big thuderstorm,

Sean
