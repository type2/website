Subject: Hints on Checking out A Syncro Westie

I posted a note directly to Ric, and then
realized that this was about the third time I
had written something like this. So I decided to
put it up on the Syncro Westie page; you 
can check it out from:
http://pwp_dot_usa.pipeline_dot_com/~tforhan/swhome.htm

I would appreciate any comments on how I can improve 
these hints for syncro westie buyers....
