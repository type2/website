Subject: trip report, sort of

I just bought a '71 Westy and towed it from California to Indiana.  I 
thought others might be interested in hearing about the experience.

Tow vehicle was a '90 Caravan with the 3.3 V6 with factory-installed towing 
package and class II hitch.  I used a tow bar that I got from Pep Boys in 
Sunnyvale for $99.  (It would have cost $166 to rent one from U-Haul.)  I 
bolted the tow bar to the front bumper mounting brackets, which was a 
mistake, since I crunched about four or five of them at various points 
during the trip, usually while turning into a gas station or campsite and 
having to go over an uneven curb.  Fortunately, they are held on by bolts 
and are easy to replace.  It would have been smarter to weld the tow bar 
connectors to the frame, and if I ever try to tow one of these again I 
definitely will get them welded.  

By the way, if you ever are in the San Diego area and need bumper mounts or 
any other used VW parts go to a place called Interstate VW, 1303 Engineer 
St. in Vista (619+598-1376).  The guy who runs it was real helpful, and his 
price was good.

I towed the thing through the Mojave Desert when it was 117 degrees.  The 
tow car got hot on the long grades, and I pulled over from time to time to 
let it (and its aluminum heads) cool.  Other than that I had no problems 
with the Caravan.  Mileage while towing was about 18 mpg, down from its 
usual 23-24 mpg.  Except for worrying about when the next bumper mount would 
break, it was a pretty easy trip.
