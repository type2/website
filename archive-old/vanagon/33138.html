Subject: SSVC/Cool Splitty Stckers/swap

Sitting tonight and blown away by response from the other side of the pond
regarding swapping Splitty stickers...
I can swap any of the stickers SSVC (Split Screen Van Club) make for anything
far out featuring Splitties (I'm too old to say cool, that's my kids
language)..anyone access Endangered Species?
SSVC Club Sticker, or scenes with splits with captions like Pamper Your
Camper, Type 2 owners are nice types too, I did my bit and saved a split, Home
is where you park it, Split Screen Motoring, all are about 3-4&quot; in diameter
and stick inside the glass...in two/three colours. (New ones being decided as
we speak as well..).
You can buy..each is say 4 dollars (incl post) or better why not swap? E mail
me dirct, write via snail mail to Dave Eccles, 93 Dunton Road, Broughton
Astley, Leicester LE9 6NA England. Looking forward to my other sort of post!!
&quot;Old Busers may take a long time to get there but sure have more pleasure on
the way and always arrive in style!&quot;   Dave :)
