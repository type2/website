Well folks, looks like our dreams are coming true, stainless pipes at last.
I hope everyone is flooding this guy with requests, if not, do so!!   You
may not need a set of pipes now, but you will!  And they wouldn't be ready
for a while I suspect anyhow.  If they could be persuaded to make a batch of
say 100 available to list members I'd be happy.  Up here rust takes its toll
pretty fast, 5-6 years max for OEM pipes, 2-3 for the cheapo's.  So send in
your votes!!!! (insert usual disclaimer here)  Tim Smith


PS: anyone know if a complete 2.1 system will fit the 1.9, ignoring old
style mounts.  This would be the best startup choice, 2.1l pipes, if so.
The Syncro front pipe will likely still be NA outside dealer. grrr
