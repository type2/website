&gt;I am looking to &quot;Vent Visors&quot; for my 1985 Vanagon GL.  I have tried
&gt;several places but cannot find s source for these items.  &quot;Vent Visors&quot;
&gt;is the brand name for the things that attach to the front doors and
&gt;let you crack the windows for ventilation.  The ones I have seen are
&gt;tinted.

there is a company in Atlanta, GA called Autoshades who USED to make them
for Vanagons, but has quit selling or even talking about them. :(  the
only place i've seen them now is in the German companys' catalogs.
and the only ones i've seen are plastic/lexan and are definitely tinted.
they glue INTO the window top, and the glass kinda rattles on the plastic
if you don't roll it down far enough. :(

for the breadloaf buses, you have to put up with chrome ones that screw
into the door's sheet metal! :(

now, VW dealers USED to sell the Autoshades ones as an accessory, under the
ZVW catalog (where they have the stuff like floor mats, wooden shift knobs,
and so forth). but no one that i've talked to has them anymore. :(

if anyone finds a source for these, please post it to the list.
