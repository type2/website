&gt; hear the tiny pop of igniting gas when I did this. Hum... wonder if the
&gt; refrigerator vent is blocked? Took off the vent fitting and looked in.
&gt; There was an arachnid condo in there. After clearing the webs out, the
&gt; refer started right up. The trip was saved and I didn't go broke at the
&gt; refrigeration shop. Seems that spiders love gas. I knew they liked to
&gt; colonize natural gas pipes, but they like LP as well.

That's interesting.  I bought one of those mini-LP grills which are quite
a good item to have for camping.  In the manual, it recommended that you
should check the burner tube for spider-web infestations before you start
it up for the season.  Sounds like the same applies to the flue vent for
campers.  Of course, I keep the cover on it.  Anyone know where I can get
a cheap replacement for the flue cover which self destructs after about 
a years use.  They're $18.00 at the dealer.  I keep looking at various
Tupperware type plastic bowls for a substitue, but haven't found any that
fit.  I'm sure VW researched the size of the flue cover so that you wouldn't
be able to use anything but their cover. ;)
