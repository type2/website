Subject: Re: VW Emblem on Front nose of Bus

&gt;
&gt;Thanks to all the comments and suggestions on anchoring my VW emblem to the
&gt;front of my bus. Here is how I ended up doing it:
&gt;
&gt;I went to Ace Hardware and got 4 blue plastic #8 wall anchors. They fit
&gt;perfectly into the holes on the front end. The emblem posts fit the anchors
&gt;like a glove, and the anchors expanded into the hole. I couldn't get it off
&gt;if I wanted to now.
&gt; (the emblem that is) :-)
&gt;
Ha!  GREAT solution to a hard-to-find part.  My emblem's on using old clips
from another bus, but I'm saving your post in case I need some (or know
someone who does) in the future.
