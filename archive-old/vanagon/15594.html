Now you know why Chrysler kicked VW's arse in the van wars.... The 
Chrysler vans hold a bit over 50% of the market. They knew what people 
wanted instead of hanging on to 50 year old technology (rear engine) and 
trying to sell it here in the US.

Believe me I love air-cooled VW,s but a Vanagon cannot even coume close 
to a Chrysler van
