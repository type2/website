Subject: front suspension

Hi there
My 'bus' really needs a replacement of the front torsion bars/springs. It's
sagging quite severely. However, the non-availability of Brazilian bars for
the next 6 months means I will have to find some temporary solution. Someone
suggested I just turn the bars upside down in their tubes and let them work
the other way around. Without getting my fingers grimey plus a lot of
swearing has anyone done this exercise before? Is it technically possible at
all? Any suggestions? Let me know when you wake up on your side of the planet.
Christian
