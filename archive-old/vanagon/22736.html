Subject: Tires for Eurovan

Does anybody have any leads on the Goodyear g60 tires that are original 
equipment on Eurovans?

I need to find four with in about the next month.

The tire man I deal with (typically pretty good) has yet to gome up with 
a source. Everything he hears is the tires are on backorder etc.
