Subject: Re: Why VW's + T&amp;A?

I have to agree with Dan on this and I can't back him up strongly 
enough. I try my best not to deal with those companies which think that 
the male VW enthusiast is so gullible that he would think that their 
product is better because a semi-clothed woman is sitting on or near it.  
Another thought I think we should consider is how female fans of VWs feel 
when they are confronted with these images whenever they want to read one 
of the VW magazines or check out a car show.  We are all in this 
together, let's respect everyone.
