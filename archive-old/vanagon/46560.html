Subject: 	Vanagon H2O pump?

Was in traffic yesterday in my '87 Westy when my alternator/O2 lights
went on, followed quickly by the temp rising. D*mn, lost a belt.
Popped the cover, sure enough there were belts loose everywhere ...
but none broken! Odd. Then I noticed no pulley on the H2O pump! Found
it lying in the engine compartment.
