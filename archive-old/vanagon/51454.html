&gt;The Mustang Ranch offers group rates, or so I hear.  And there's plenty of
&gt;free parking by the air strip.

then Jazzhouse Joel replies:  and the Cottontail ranch had LOTS of free
parking! (but that's ALL that's free!!) ... and it's not toooo far from the
Mammoth campgrounds. well ... as the crow flies, anyway. by road, it takes
FOREVER to get to Mammoth!!! ;)
