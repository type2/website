Subject: Northeast Gathering.....


First, congrats to our more southerly bretheren for putting together
a meet in North Carolina.

However, NC is a bit too far for me to travel for a weekend, and
I suspect others up here in NE. So.....
howabout the handfull of us up here, anyone interested in getting
together?

Ric
