Subject: RE:OK, barndoor nuts! What's this?



&gt; 
&gt; Maybe this is a dumb question...but with the bullet turn signals,
&gt; are you sure this is a barn door? We had a dsicussion about what
&gt; a &quot;barn door&quot; is in this group a while back. And a &quot;barndoor&quot;
&gt; refers to the very large engine lid on the rear of the van. The rear
&gt; window does not have a hatch (a la later vans), and therefore is 
&gt; stationary. You should be able to see the fuel tank and spare tire
&gt; inside the engine compartment.
&gt; 
&gt; The original poster of this discussion thought the term &quot;barn door&quot;
&gt; referred to the two cargo doors on the side of the van.
&gt; 
&gt; Just curious...

Ric,

	I thought about this as well but in Cecil's post it also says 
    that it has semiphors as well, these were eliminated in 1956. In this 
    case a previous owner must of added his own turn signals to the bus.
