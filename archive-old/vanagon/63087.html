&gt;&gt; ps: re: Lugs - Answer?  Testors paint pen!?! give me a break!  I've got a
&gt;&gt; brother named Blaine, he's just like that, he once fixed a windshield wiper
&gt;&gt; with gum, is that you Blaine? when did you get a Vanagon? ;-D
&gt;
&gt;I thought i'd defend dave here.  His vanagon is immaculate (not a scratch
&gt;on it that i could find.) Never seen a wad of bubble gum and he seems to
&gt;take care of mechanical problems as soon as they crop up.  Interior is
&gt;spotless. I had vanagon envy ;) mine is a POS!
&gt;
&gt;Personally, if i had lugnuts that were painted silver by the factory and
&gt;the silver paint came off, id use a testors paint pen too, or any other
&gt;suitable means to replace the factory coating.  His dad had that van for a
&gt;long time so if he says the lugnuts were painted and it came off i believe
&gt;him.
&gt;
&gt;my $0.02

Dave? I hope you and Steve are still pals.  If you'er ever cruising I-55 by
all means stop in and we'll compare Lug bolts or somethin'  :-}
