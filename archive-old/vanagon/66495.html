Subject:      '81 Vanagon Seats Available

Seeing that there's some interest in older bus middle seats (recent
thread on the Type2 list) I thought I might try to get rid of the seats I
removed from my Vanagon 6 months ago, and have been sitting in my
garage ever since.

These seats came out of a Vanagon &quot;L&quot; and have the brown
corduroy/leatherette covering.

Front seats are pretty well shot upholstery-wise, with corduroy pretty
much gone.

Rear seat is fair; splits along the top of the seatback, otherwise intact.

Middle seat might be rated as high as &quot;good&quot;; no splits or tears, one
somewhat worn spot.

Anyway, we have a big trash day coming up soon so I'll pitch them unless
there's any interest.  They're too big to ship, so somebody in the SF Bay
Area will need to pick them up.

Make any offer, or, figure out when my neighborhood's big trash day is
and come along in the middle of the night and snatch them from the curb!
