Subject: Re: Propane going out while driving

Remember, too, that all of you who have &quot;three-way&quot; refrigerators,
can actually make them work a fourth way as well - as an ice
chest.  I've had good luck putting a small block of ice or
frozen blue ice in the westy, so that when I need to stop,
I can turn off the DC, but NOT have to turn on the propane.  As
long as one doesn't open the door much, this seems to work
pretty well even over night.

Then again, you could always wrap things in flannel instead
of plastic for better insulation  ;)
