Morning everybody!

Before anybody asks, yes, I did read the Hoover sermon on these things.  It
seems like a good idea to me and the guy who's rebuilding the engine from
the '67 Rusty thinks so too.  Ok, I leafed through HotVWs and found two ads
that had these things.  One place was Nopi at ~$55 and the other was So. Cal
imports at ~$40.

Does anybody have any reason why I shouldn't put one of these on my bus
motor?  Does anybody recommend a mail-order place to get one besides (or
including) the two I mentioned?

Thanx!

Bob J.
