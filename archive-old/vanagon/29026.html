Subject:       Any Pamona Show-goers?

Just curious if anyone from the list is going to be at the big show 
on Sunday.

Me and a couple buddies are planning to drive down for the weekend 
(from here in sunny warm Salt Lake City).  Unfortunately the Pioneer 
isn't is good enough shape to bring to the show... Maybe next summer, 
and a few thousand bucks later...

Wear those Netsurfnugen shirts if ya got 'em!
