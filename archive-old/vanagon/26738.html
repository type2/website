Subject: Re: Engine transferred, finally !


&gt;Anyway, last week we took the engine out of the '78 and put it in the '71.
&gt;This didn't go as quick as we had hoped. The 'problem` was with the
&gt;transmission. In a '78 the trans is bolted to the chassis, whilst in a '71
&gt;it is not, making it a difficult job lining up the engine (bolts) with it.

I wonder if it is a simple bolt-on procedure to fit the the transmission
support brace from the 72-up European type I engined bus (or a 72-up
American type IV bus) onto an American 68-71 bus.  Do the European and
American 72-later buses have the same chassis design in this area, just
different engines? What would a carrier retrofit entail?  The CVs/rear
suspension is the same on the later buses so I assume the brace doesn't make
a real functional difference--only convenience for engine removal.  Any
insights?
