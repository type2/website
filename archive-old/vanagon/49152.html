I have just purchased a 1984 Westfalia and am wondering if some of you
veteran owners can give me a hand.  The van is in great shape body and
engine wise; however, in the last month it has been popping out of first
gear.  This has only happened four or five times and always on a steep
hill.  Is this just a simple lever problem or is it something more
serious?
