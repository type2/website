Subject: Blinker problems.

I have an blinker problem with my '87 Weekender that I hope somebody can
help me with. The symptoms are:

- When I turn on my right blinker, the brake lights blink in addition to the
right turn signals.

- When I brake, my right turn signals (front and back) light up in addition
to the brake lights.

- When I turn on my emergency flashers on, my turn signals and my brake
lights come flash. I don't think the brake lights should blink.

I've trace the wiring diagrams in Bentley and can't see how stepping on the
brakes can light up the right turn signals unless there's a wiring problem
or a problem in the fuse/relay board.

Somebody suggested replacing the emergency flasher relay. I don't see how
this affects the brake lights unless it's leaking current onto the fuse
board, but its worth try.

Any other suggestions? 

Thanks.
