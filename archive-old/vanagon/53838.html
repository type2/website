&gt; Hi there,
&gt; 
&gt; I have a probem with my 86 Vanagon GL.  It starts right  up, even on the coldest
&gt; mornings, but when it has warmed up, it starts to misfire, running too rich,
&gt; black smoke out the exhaust, and with  no power to pull even the smallest hill. 
&gt; But when I turn the motor off and start it up again, it runs fine for awhile,
&gt; and then the misfiring starts again with the black exhaust smoke.
&gt; 
&gt; The vehicle had been setting for about a year, and I thought it might be bad
&gt; gasoline, but after several tanks, it still has the problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas as to what would cause these effects?

     My guess is a dirty fuel injector.
