Subject: Backward Distributor

In a message dated 96-04-22 11:02:02 EDT, you write:

&gt;The distributor is installed 180 degrees out.  I've swapped the wires, 1 to
3, etc.
&gt; The question I have is this, 
&gt;is there any logical reason why an engine would run any different set up 
&gt;this way?

Yes, and a very important reason, too.  If the engine is fitted the up-right
oil cooler, #3 cylinder is bathed with the heated air coming from the oil
cooler.  This means #3 is going to run hotter than the other cylinders, wear
faster and its exhaust valve will be the first to fail.  To alleviate the
problem Volkswagen grinds three two degrees of retard into the #3 cam lobe on
the distributors used in all engines having up-right oil coolers.  That
translates as four degrees of retardation at the crank and my be observed by
hooking a stroboscopic timing light to #3 and observing the firing point on a
degreed fan-pulley.

When the distributor is installed backwards and you swap the wires around to
make it run, you end up timing the engine using the #3 cam lobe in the
distributor.  Things seem fine but you have just built a time bomb, because
if you time the engine at seven and a half degrees BTDC, cylinders 2, 3 &amp; 4
will be firing at 11.5 degrees.  And at full advance, on a hot engine, with
that much advance you will experience detonation.  At the same time, #3 is
going to be cooking itself to death.  It is just a matter of time before you
trash the engine.

The proper fix is to time the engine to #1, pull the distributor driver-gear
and install it correctly.
