  OFFICE MEMO          RE&gt;EV Pwr Locks                        Date:1/22/96

Rick G. wrote&lt;the power door locks sometimes don't
lock the sliding door until the 2nd time they're activated. The mechanism
goes its grinding, and I can see the lock button wiggle a bit, but it
doesn't go down.

I write:
&lt;  I had the same problem with my '93EV. It turned out it was a plastic
(plastic?!!) clip somewhere in the door (according to the dealer). When this
craps out, the pwr locks don't function properly. If I recall it was a pretty
cheap fix. This may be the problem, on the other hand, it may not be the
problem. Good luck.

Peace

'93EV MV (with operational locks)
