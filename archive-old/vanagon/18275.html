&gt; With regards to #1 above, I think the EV is underpowered with just one in it 
&gt;  ;-)
&gt; However, you could try any or all of the following:
&gt; 1) got a catalytic converter?  take it out...you did say you were in a poor
&gt; country, didn't you?  :-O
      ***poor ...but has unleaded fuel countrywide..save our environment!&gt;
&gt;     you can shoehorn some MB turbodiesel truck engine into your Transporter. 
&gt; Remember,
&gt;     you want big horsepower, and big torque, OK?
         **that's not an easy way,I'm looking for turbo kit for EV.
&gt; 3) what happened to the MB 500 SL that you got the wheels from?...  
	SL got new BRABUS wheel and throw away those wheels.
&gt; 4) sell your Transporter immediately to PJ in Ireland (hey, are you still
&gt; alive over there?),
&gt;     and contact William Kennedy about setting yourself up with a Vanagon
&gt; packed with a Porsche
&gt;     air-cooled flat six, preferably a Syncro.
&gt;         **I will sell it as soon as the VR6 arrive.

&gt; The other thing you could do is bribe some highway construction crew to pave
&gt; the road to your
         *** yeah right,the road here like the moon surface.
