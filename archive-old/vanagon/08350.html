&gt;Also, a call for opinions.  This group seems to always have
&gt;plenty ;)  so I figured this is a good source.  I want to
&gt;repaint the 68, top to bottom.  Right now it's a pretty dull
&gt;white.  I'm thinking about painting each below-window body
&gt;panel a different primary color.  The roof, posts, etc. would
&gt;be white again.  The rest of it would be, bright, shall we say.

well ... Volvo did some research years ago, and found that this sort of
paint scheme was the safest, most visible in all conditions. now what they
found was a white top, orange body, yellow doors and hood and trunk was
about the best combination. but nobody would buy it. :)

i, personally, (since i don't have to live with it) don't see a problem here.
there is a tiny shortened bus running around town, painted up like a rainbow.
and it looks pretty neat ... certainly visible in traffic.

it'll be kinda hard to paint those panels and get the borders straight and
even, though. what about a real challenge: white top, yellow and black
checkerboard below the windows??? :)  can you say &quot;Taxi&quot;???
