Subject: Re:  Q on converting bus to a camper

Brad J Winemiller inquires:
&gt;Hello all.  Any ideas on how hard it would be to convert a regular bus to a 
&gt;camper bus.  I want to convert my 69 to a camper.  I've found an old rusty 70 
&gt;westfalia for parts.  Is it possible, and economical to do this.  Any Ideas 
&gt;what a good price is to pay for the camper interior.  Another question would be
&gt;, if I remember right 71 was the year for some changes in mechanical aspect of 
&gt;the bus, so are 69 and 70 parts for the most part interchangeable, incase I 
&gt;have to buy a whole bus.
&gt;Thanks
&gt;Brad

Shouldn't be too hard at all.  Everything bolts in with the only cutting being
a hole in the driver's side for the outlet connections, a hole behind the
passenger seat for the sink drain and a hole in the roof behind the passenger
seat for the sink vent.  You might want to swap the side windows, which were
louvered on the campers.  I think the mechanical changes between 69-71 are
minimal.  The main thing that comes to mind is the 71 has disk brakes in
front and power brakes.  I wouldn't attempt cutting a hole in your 69 for
the poptop.  If you make a mistake, you're screwed.  It might leak, and I
think the roof around the opening is different than if you just cut a hole
in it.  Eg. I think there's some bracing or extra metal there.  Look closely
at the opening on one of the parts buses first and make sure this is
something you really want to do.  Besides, the poptop was an option anyway.
Not all campers had them.
