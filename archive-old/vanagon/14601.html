&gt;&gt;Nice poem...but if H, B, and M are the three bibles,

&gt;joel
&gt;I'm not a player, but i engineer one at work.    ;)
&gt;

ok, I did...let's take a gander at what it do say...
  1 - writings or statements of dubious authenticity [I'll buy that]
  2 - early Christian writings not included in the New Testament 
      [I always knew we had a religion of our own ;-), pray to St Ferry of
       Porsche, lest he smite thee with a broken gland nut.  Or some such]

So there :-)

saying, 'Oh, Lord, bless this thy hand grenade that with it thou
mayest blow thy enemies to tiny bits, in thy mercy.'  And the Lord
did grin, and people did feast upon the lambs, and sloths, and
carp, and anchovies, and orangutans, and breakfast cereals, and
fruit bats, and large --&quot;

Two points for him/her wot knows wot this came from...
