Subject: Westfalia Questions

     1. Was there ever any factory or dealer option to put an additional 
     single seat in the Westfalia in proximity to the sliding door?  I can 
     see how it might be done with an extra front seet, swivel plate, and a 
     purpose-made pedestal.
     
     2. Anyone know of a source for 1991 Westfalia dealer brochures?
     
     TIA
