Subject: Re: Crashworthiness of Bug Vans


Unfortunately, I have some info to relay about the safety of VW vans,
namely the bay-window busses.  Last week my friend accidentally released
the parking brake in my 79 and she went rolling down the hill.
I jumped in to stop the bus but I was too late, she had hit another car.
Well, if my judgment is correct my bus was going less than 5 mph when it
made impact.  The result of hitting this parked car is I need a new drivers
side door.  Not only was there a huge dent, but it was misaligned so now
it won't open or close right at all.  This is pretty sad for a 5mph 
accident!  I don't want to imagine a 30 mph accident.  
With this in mind, be extremely careful!
