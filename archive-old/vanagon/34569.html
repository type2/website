Subject: Get Yer List Stickers here!!!

Here's the lowdown on the newest fine list product:

Identification stickers for your bus
 Oval shaped, 5 inch major axis, 3 inch minor axis
 Chrome mylar material (i.e. shiny silver)
 Exterior sticker ( because you can stick an outside sticker on a window, but
   you can't stick a window sticker on anything else. I also decided against
   those nifty static-stickers, as they were too expensive)
 The design is that of a European country badge, (as in D for Deutschland,
etc.)
   but with the letters (of course) VW as the &quot;country&quot;, in black ink. Inside
   the thin black border, there is, in 3/16&quot; letters,
   &quot;Vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu&quot;

The costs are as follows:

   3-pack - $5.00
   7-pack - $10.00
   10-pack- $15.00
   15-pack- $20.00
or 25 beautiful stickers for $25.00
additional stickers will be roughly $2.00 each.
(I will also consider trades for rust-free campers...)
:)

So then, here's what to do:
Send a self addressed, STAMPED envelope
(a standard business envelope will be fine, just make sure they'll fit)
to:

Richard Palmer
121-C Park Ave
Raleigh, NC 27605-1832

Hidden inside that envelope, I would prefer cash, but a check is ok. Sending
cash can cause problems, so it's a risky kind of thing.

POSTAGE:
 for up to 7 stickers, use one 32-cent stamp
 for 8-15, use two 32-cent stamps
 and add stamps for additional stickers.

Non-USA orders, please send an extra $3.00 for postage. (in USA cash)

Placement of stickers shall be on the rear left area, either bumper or window,
or somewhere visible to cars passing you, and, if you want, somewhere on the
driver's front side, so cars passing the opposite way can spot you. A big
purpose of these stickers is to quickly identify fellow listmembers.
So, get those orders rolling. I *do* have 500 to get rid of...
Please indeed order, there are PLENTY left...

NOTE:
if you don't send a self addressed, STAMPED envelope (foreign orders=cash for
postage), then I CAN'T send you your stickers, now can I??? Please make sure
you have everything together, and it will all flow smoothly. Thanks for your
help,
and enjoy...
