Subject: Re: Replacement seats

To all,
	Just like to sya thanks to guys who replied to my query about
replacement seats for my camper. The captain seats from an old Westphalia
really seem a good idea. I have a look locally (N.E. UK) to see if I can find
them or if not I'm taking the bus to Germany over Easter so it will be an excuse
to look around some scrap yards over there. I apreciate the offer of someone 
shipping them over but I think I'll look around in Europe first.
	Some one pointed me to the archive material where I found lots of seat 
stuff so I'm sure there is lot of other good stuff there too. I would recomend 
any newbie to point there gopher to it (Gopher://halfdan.med.umn_dot_edu/Miscellaneo
s/Vanagon).
	How many more people like me are preparing there vans for the coming 
season. Maybe I'll even try to improve the heating so I won't freeze next 
winter. I'm looking forward to maybe getting to a few rallies in the U.K..
	I am a German speaker, but I won't offer my translation services, I 
think the current &quot;uebersetzer&quot; are doing just fine.
