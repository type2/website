Subject:      after the Unknowns again!!

 Vanagon Mailing List   357 people,   328 vehicles
   46 Microbus,  123 Bus,  149 Vanagon,   10 Eurovan
   63 Unknown,    14 Wanabus

ok, folks. there are ENTIRELY TOO MANY Unknowns out there!!! :)

all i want to know is what model bus you drive/own/sleep in (and the year)
and where (country/city/state/province) you are in (or reasonably close to)
...

if you do NOT have a bus but are planning on getting one in the next hundred
years, that qualifies you as a Wanabus. :)

thanks.
