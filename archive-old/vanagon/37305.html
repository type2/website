&gt;This new engine is now burning oil at the rate of at least 1 quart per 1000
&gt;miles.  In the last 400 miles it burned 3/4 quart.  Nick Fernandez at Golden
&gt;Gate VW maintains that this is &quot;normal&quot;.  I don't agree with Nick.
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone have any official info on oil consumption?  Has anyone had this
&gt;experience? Any advice on how to get results from VW?
&gt;
&gt;

1 quart per 1000 miles a liitle high but not excessive.  Quart/400 miles is.
 VW claims quart /600 miles is normal but I do not believe that from my own
experience.  What type of oil are you using and what viscosity?  How fast do
you drive?  How full do keep crancase?  I find people tend to overfill.  From
temparature testing, I've determined that best level is between the marks on
the dipstick.  1 extra cup can raise oil temp 40F with every thing else
equal.  This will also increase consumption and do damage due to oil foaming
and puddling at the cylinder botoms.
Dennis.
