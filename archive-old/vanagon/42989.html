Subject: Stranded in MO

I just received a call from a from a friend of mine who is traveling with 
his mother and brother in a recently acquired Vanagon Westy.  They are 
stranded in Colombia MO with a defunct water pump.  Checking the phone 
books, it appears there is a place called Walts VW.  Does anyone have any 
suggestions regarding Walts or a good place in the area to have a 
waterpump replaced?

Appreciate the assistance.

Fred
