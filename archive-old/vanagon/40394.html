Subject: bus with corvair engine

I met today by accident a guy who has an early 70's Transporter with an 6 
cylinder corvair engine for sale. The body of the bus is pretty rusty but 
he wants only $500.00 for it.
I don't know anything about corvair engines. Is this a good deal just to 
get the engine and transplant it into a better bus? How difficult is 
maintaining this type of engines?
Oh the guy mentioned that he gets only between 10 and 15mpg. Is this 
normal or just the result of a poorly adjusted engine?
If there are any corvair specialists out there.....Any info on that would 
be greatly appreciated.
