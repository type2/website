Subject: Re: Eurovan Central Locking

&gt; My 1995 EV-Winne has developed the irritating habit
&gt; of cycling its power door locks locked/unlocked
&gt; continually when the weather is wet.  This occurs when 
&gt; trying to operate the lock.  Once inside with the door
&gt; closed, the cycling stops.  I have to time
&gt; a pull on the door handle in order to get in!  When
&gt; the weather is dry, everything is normal.  Sometimes
&gt; the problem can be overcome by using the lock on the 
&gt; other door, but the problem is not restricted to one lock.

We don't have the power locks so we can't &quot;look at ours&quot; but I would 
suspect that you have a eletric switch that is making contact when you 
turn the key but if its wet the &quot;thin strip&quot; part of the switch is 
getting held to the other part by the moisture.  I think a thin coat of 
lubricant that would pass the current put keep the moisture from sticking 
to the metal parts would help.  Most of the electric work I do is inside 
electronics so someone else will have to recommend a lubricant.  Isn't 
there a lubricant for points that would pass the current but also shed 
the water?
