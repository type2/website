Hi, I hope that by this time you're OK. Sorry for your Westy. Now you're
free for a week, take a plane and come to rest in Puerto Rico. We'll tour
you around the island. Tomorrow we'll have the VolkyMania Festival and in
the 15th the delayed 2nd Bug-In at Caguas. I hope you'll find another Westy
pretty soon. Best regards,

Angel
