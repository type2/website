Subject: message for jwalker, need your help at Graham Salvage 

If you recall, my Vanagon was rear ended in 1/1/96 and you told me that there
was a roll over Vanagon at Graham Salvage. I finally got something back from
other party's insurance ($3,200) but the collision shop said they can't fix
the Vanagon with such a small amount. So I am going to fix it myself.
Now I need help to get the following parts, the rear bumper with both end
caps and branket for the right hand (passenger) side, the rear hatch door,
and this small electonic part that is located right behind the taillight
housing with the VW part # 251 907 393B.
Can you tell me what is the name of this part and what it is for?
Also, for the above parts, can you quote me the price first (with the cost of
shipping to NYC)  since I am not rich yet. :)

Thanks for your help.
