Subject: High Idle Speed Problem

&gt;Subject: High Idle Speed Problem

&gt;I would greatly appreciate any help/suggestions that could
&gt;be offered.

FWIW, I had high idle problems, but ONLY when the
temperatures were at or above 100F degrees last summer.  I
never did track down the problem.  When the weather cooled
down, the problem went away.
