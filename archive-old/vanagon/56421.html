&gt;I agree on this, when I lived in Menlo Park from 91 to 1993, it took me a
&gt;long time to get these very good and nice mechanics. At that time, I've
&gt;owned a '84 and a '85 Vanagon GL. I had misfiring on the '84, sometimes it
&gt;would die completely, I got 2 tuneup at =A7=A3$_at_* mechanics for nothing and=
&gt; at
&gt;Fred's, they found the problem very quickly. The guy just changed the spark
&gt;plugs caps, not even the wires, and the van ran like a dream! I had these
&gt;misfires for weeks before that. The price was almost nothing. Even if you
&gt;live far from them, it's definitely worth the trip as Charles says.
&gt;Right now, I don't have these kind of problems since my Syncro is a TD
&gt;engine. No more misfires, shorts, etc, but still cooling problems anyway.
&gt;The head gasket needs to be replaced, oh  well....:(

One of my neighbors has his own garage, works *only* on American iron; he's
quite  competent working on our US vehicle, but won't touch the Vanagon (&amp;
he's German!).  Anyhow he told me the best/only place in the bay area for
German cars is Fred's in Redwood City, bar none &amp; period. (usual
disclaimers/etc.).
