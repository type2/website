I DO  know of a nice, solid splity in down-east maine.  I live up here too
(Lewiston) and theres _several_ at a guy's place out in poland (Raymond?) 
He's a good V.W. mechanic and rebuilt a lot of it.  needs paint and
engine.  it'd buy it if i had the cash.

more info?  e-mail me at: jandrus_at_abacus.bates_dot_edu
