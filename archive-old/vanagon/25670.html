&gt;&gt; I see dulpicate postings several times a day - mostly together, but
&gt;&gt; sometimes separated by several other postings.  Is this something any of you 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; are experiencing or is just me?

Yeah, me too.  Sometimes it takes an hour or three before my most recent
posting appears in my mailbox.  So, I guess some folks are resending their
posts, thinking that somehow they didn't get posted.
