&gt;
&gt;Dear Derek,
&gt;
&gt;Thank for your informative email.
&gt;
&gt;With help of the information I was for the first time using Internet WWW to
find
&gt;the information yout outlined. I copy a lot of them. But I could't find what  I
&gt;was most intersted of, please help me if you know the source:
&gt;
&gt;I have bougth two used 2.1 engine that I plan to put together to one complete
&gt;engine.
&gt;I wonder if any  that you know have made a practical  detailed instruction how
&gt;to put a complete 2.1 litre engine in parts and put togeteher again. I only
have
&gt;information of air cooled engine and the original VW service manual is not so
&gt;informative of how to do if you don't have all of the special tools the
assume!.
&gt;So far I have built a a Engine holder so it is easy to take the engine into
&gt;parts without crawling around on the floor.
&gt; Of special interest is information about the head gasket and how to fix
them if
&gt;leaking. (The only reason I want to have one extra engine ready, is when my
&gt;original engine sooner or later start to leak on the head gasket (common fault
&gt;also in Sweden,(only real weak part in the engine I belive)) and therefore I
&gt;want to be able to change very quickly to my other engine)
&gt;
&gt;I shall soon subscibe to the mailing list to.
&gt;
&gt;Back to your questions.
&gt;
&gt;My 2.1 liter syncro has 112  horsepower since it has no  &quot;katalysator&quot;
comparing
&gt;to the 95 horsepower version you probely has. Yes my  gear ratio is 4.86. 
&gt;My car is special to, I have both front and rear air differential lock as well
&gt;as original webasto water heator.  I have rebulild it so I have the extra spare
&gt;tire at front. 
&gt;
&gt;I have good news  concerning the repair/parts /electrical manuals !.
&gt;
&gt;I have all original V.A,G. service mnuals in English from VW.
&gt;(I once get the correct order numbers and just order them and strange enougt,
&gt;they deliver !!!).
&gt;
&gt;I wonder, are you working at VW, U.S.A or not !
&gt;
&gt;In Sweden a few 16 transporter are around. I happens to know that one of the
&gt;best sevice expert of VW syncro persons  work at VW headquarter in SWEDEN:
&gt;
&gt;Bengt Soderlund  phone  +46-8-55386750
&gt;
&gt;have  himself personal interest  for this special version , and i think he just
&gt;get one . He plan to cross Russia or something like that with the car, so
try to
&gt;phone him. If not any succes call me again  and I should find out if he has a
&gt;e-mail adress.
&gt;
&gt;Please explain what ADM and ACU stand for 
&gt;
&gt;If you have a fax number I can try to send over a few pictures of the 16
version
&gt;if you want.
&gt;My fax number is +4631993138
&gt;
&gt;By the way I found you list of Technical Bulletins most intersting. 
&gt;I have myself solved the  TB#12 and TB #13 by solder a 0.5$ 10 uF capasitor
&gt;between  the correct pins on the air-flow meter contacts for more than one
years
&gt;ago and then after that I had no problem. 
&gt;
&gt; An other very strange fault is when the car don't start after the motor is
shut
&gt;off after it is warm, that can be the tempearture sensor that has bad
connection
&gt;and hence give a  wrong resistanse value foling the Digijet box to think it is
&gt;something like  30 C degree cold and therefore give to rich gasoline so the
&gt;engine cant start when it is warm !!. Just clean the connector and the car work
&gt;fine again!!
&gt;
&gt;In the TB#xx  list I could only read to number  TB#20. Do You know where I find
&gt;the rest of the list (21 to27 to 60 ??)
&gt;
&gt;Best Regards
&gt;
&gt;Lars
