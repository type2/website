Old Bus Review is the bi-monthly newsletter of NEATO, the early
bus club ('67 &amp; earlier).  I just finished typing six
single-spaced pages of ads for the next issue so I know whereof I
speak.  Editor of the OBR is Tom Brouillette, who puts out an
excellent newsletter.  NEATO originally stood for NorthEast
Association of Transporter Owners.  They have since gone
worldwide and NE is now pretty much Nearly Everywhere.
Membership is $20US per year.

You can snail mail to

NEATO
P.O. Box 4190
Albuquerque, NM 87196
