Subject: Re: New EV Camper (was Weakly Statz ... :)

&gt;Oh Joeeeeel.....! (and list members):
&gt;
&gt;I picked up my new Eurovan Camper yesterday, so you can now add me to next
&gt;week's stats!
&gt;
&gt;It's a '95, and I live in Seattle, Washington. Anything else you need to
know???
&gt;
&gt;Thanks to the many of you who responded to my purchase queries of last week.
&gt;Your advice and &quot;go for it&quot; attitude were big plusses in the decision-making
&gt;process. I am now breaking it in (currently at 113 miles), and my friends want
&gt;me to get a license plate that makes reference to &quot;Megan's Playhouse.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;Now that I'm an owner, am I required to participate in a blood pact or a sweat
&gt;lodge ritual or anything? Or perhaps there's a scarification rite, performed
&gt;with a tool  heated over the two-burner propane stove....&lt;g&gt;
&gt;
&gt;No longer a sniveling lurker---
&gt;Megan
&gt;
&gt;PS--Do the Eurovans typically come with floor mats? Mine didn't, but I'm
&gt;thinking that they forgot to replace them following detailing. I can't believe
&gt;that with a &quot;car&quot; of this price, they WOULDN&quot;T provide floor mats.....

 Of course there's an initiation! Whenever a listee travels to Washington,
you need to give him/her the keys and registration of your vehicle in order
for them to enjoy their stay, have a place to sleep and transportation.
That's all!   ;-)
