&gt; I know we're straying far from VWs but I would have to disagree with the
&gt; statement that EDTA is &quot;extremely benign&quot;. We, that is all living

Another article I read, this time harder to find since it's source 
doesn't readily come to mind, mentioned that you could eat EDTA without 
ill effect, which is where my statement derived from.  Although I haven't 
spent any time running around a little cage lately ;), so I can't vouch 
from personal experience.

&gt; creatures, rely on ions (anions, cations, mono,di and polyvalent) as key
&gt; components in all biochemical events. Any substance that would interfere,
&gt; by chelation or binding, of these ions can cause dramatic effects. Calcium
&gt; ions, for example, are integral to the mechanism of muscle contraction. I
&gt; mentioned the controversial plaque removing treatment involving EDTA, part
&gt; of the controversy lies in the judging of how much EDTA to administer (by
&gt; injection), and not affect normal biochemical pathways.

I'm sure that there's substance to what you're saying, it seems to be 
your business to know.  I doubt that the original writer of the 
aforementioned article really knew for sure what the effects of injestion 
were.  I do know that the MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet, required by 
the Feds of all chemical manufacturers, for those not familiar with them) 
doesn't call for anything more radical than water flushing for eye 
contamination and inducement of vomiting for injestion, but those 
remedies probably apply to things alot more dangerous than EDTA.

I'll spend more time going through my files this weekend and see if I can 
pinpoint the source.

&gt; 
&gt; Please don't take my skepticism the wrong way, I do like hashing these
&gt; things out, I learn more.

I'm not Alistair, I only wish I could relate the facts a bit better than 
I am.

Now, for the guy who thinks I'm pitching a form of Sick (intentional sic) 
50 for batteries, _he's_ another story! (just sort of kidding 8-{) ).  I 
would never pitch something I didn't have personal experience with, in 
particular here, for personal gain.  Hell, would I be driving a pair of 
ancient VWs if I didn't feel that way?
