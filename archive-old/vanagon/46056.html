Subject: Nominations for Best 10 cars....

Hello, gang.

I found this on the Corvair list this morning, and thought that some of
us might like to nominate the Beetle instead of .... well... other
cars..

 Bob.

The Detroit news is having people pick the top 10 cars for the 100th
annivesary of the auto industry.  You can vote for your favorite or any car
you think contributed a lot to further the cause.

Send votes to:  autos_at_detnews_dot_com   OR  autos_at_ic_dot_net
