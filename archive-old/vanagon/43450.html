Subject: Marietta Meet This Month?


Does anyone know if there will be a meet/show at the tech school in
Marietta, Ga.,this month?  Peach State Transporters (Dave Easterwood and
that group) have sponsored one for the last 2 years but I have heard
nothing so far for this year. Any information is appreciated.
