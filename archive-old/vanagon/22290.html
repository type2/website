Best excuse I've ever heard. Have you ever driven in Boston!!!!
I have ridden in a car there and I swear I will never do it again.
I sure as hell won't drive there.

&gt; &gt; My SO needed a car toady (BMW Belly Up Again) so I lent her the 911!  I
&gt; &gt; wouldn't have even _thought_ to let her use the bus.  Is this proof I'm going
&gt; &gt; insane?

I guess I'm lucky that my wife can't drive a stick!
