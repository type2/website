&gt; 
&gt; Hmmm... I thought the only camper option available in the US was the
&gt; &quot;weekender&quot;, which has a small wannabe-fridge under one of the seats.
&gt; It's not a true fridge, but one of those thermostatic or whatever thingies
&gt; that only cools 40 degrees below the outside air temp.  So if it is
&gt; 90 degrees inside your camper your food will spoil :(
&gt; 

Nope, the 95 has a full camper version with the camper part done by
Winebego. I got the mailing last week and went and saw one in Fremont, CA.

It was dirty from the trip and not ready for a drive. For over 30K, I'll
stick to my 82.
