Subject: Drive-in Moo V(W)

John Sharp had an idea...

&gt;fun, any one else up to going to a classic old drive in to see a
&gt;movie?

There's one in Wellfeet, MA (on the Cape).  Would be neat to have 
those nearby get together this summer for a double-feature (that's 
the way they do it)  Maybe schedule a nation-wide &quot;vanagon-lenti's&quot; 
night at your local or near-local drive-in.....
