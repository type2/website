&gt; I'd like to publically thank my beautiful (at least I think so) '65
&gt; bus for carrying my sorry butt all 2800 miles or so from Portland, OR
&gt; to Pittsburgh, PA last week.  I knew as I was leaving that one of the
&gt; valve seats in cylinder #1 is almost shot, but I absolutely _had_ to
&gt; get on the road so I can make it to school here.  Considering this
&gt; neglect, it still performed like the champ that it is - I made the
&gt; whole trip in a week, while giving myself two to get it done.  So
&gt; anyway, thanks a million, and now I'll make good on all those
&gt; whispered promises I made to you as we drove across - really.
&gt; 
&gt; Which brings me to my next question...  These old busses are pretty
&gt; rare around here (actually, extremely rare - I've never seen another
&gt; splitty here), and I'm feeling a little lost.  Any local Pittsburghers
&gt; (even CMU students like me?) want to drop an email or get together or
&gt; something to talk shop?  I'd love to talk to you if you have any old
&gt; VW, not just a splitty.
