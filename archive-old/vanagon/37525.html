Subject: VW Coolant (liquid, that is)

Dave Mancuso recently wrote about a VW dealer putting green coolant 
in his Westy when he asked for blue. The local VW shop here says the 
green non-phosphate stuff is ok also, but I'd still prefer to use VW 
stuff when I change it.

I bought a 4L jug of Autobahn blue coolant from Speedway VW 
for my Jetta last year. Cost $14, made by BASF (in 
Canada) especially for VW. At the time I asked about the Westy 
coolant &amp; they showed me a large metal tin (1.5 liters I think) of 
German VW/Audi coolant which was to be used - cost $30-40 per tin, or over 
$100 for a full change!
I just called now &amp; they said the BASF stuff made in Canada is 
equivalent &amp; ok to use, now at $16.80 per 4L...

I'm wondering why any VW dealer would use green coolant if BASF makes 
the blue stuff here for them. Sure, $16 a gallon is a bit steep, but really not 
too bad considering...

I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
