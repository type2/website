&gt; Consumer Reports just did a study on Taxis in New York.  Their findings
&gt;  indicated that regular oil changes at 7,000 mi (Hear that Q and Jiffy?)
using SE-SF
&gt;  grade oil provided the same protection as synthetic oils.  Essentially
they
&gt;  stated that Synthetics are mostly a waste of money.

CR also states that the taxis were rarely turned off and restarted.  This
service, while severe, is considerable different that typical driver's.  I
think they used the taxis as a test because they wanted a lot of miles in a
short period of time, cut corners, and didn't want to wait for &quot;real world&quot;
testing.
