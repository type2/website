&gt;&gt;Subject: Westi window screens
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have found a set of Westi side windows with the screens but no
&gt;&gt; screen material in them,so:
&gt;&gt; 1. How hard is it to remove the screens from the windows?
&gt;
&gt;Yep.  Get some fiberglass screening material from a hardware store.  Cut
&gt;to fit the inside of the frame, then glue in place with a hot melt glue
&gt;gun.  I've done this several times on my screens.  The only reason I have
&gt;to keep redoing it is that my wife forgets to close the window and the air
&gt;rushing through it breaks the bead of glue.  An easy repair, though.

lemme add my bit...

I scraped off all the old screen and glue and cut some &quot;no-see-um&quot; netting
to fit (where I go to camp the no-see-ums are a pain. regular screening is
not fine enough to keep them out.) I use a hot glue gun to lay a bead of
glue along one edge of the frame and then lay the netting in. Use some bit
of plastic (a squeegee used in fiberglassing works well) misted lightly
with water to press the netting firmly onto the glue. Do the opposite edge,
the the other two perp edges. Trim the excees with an x-acto knife.
