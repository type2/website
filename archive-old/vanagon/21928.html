Subject: Vanagon double cab spotted


Don't know if it is rare or not, but it was great looking!

A vanagon pickup, double cab, 3 doors, the emblem on the back (right
bottom) said &quot;TRANSPORTER&quot;. Had rather tall tires/rims on, they fit it
beautifully.

Spotted at the frisbee golf course in Santa Cruz, CA. Since I go there
every weekend I am bound to see it again (let's hope the owner likes
the game and comes back!).

An owner of a splitty that plays there frequently had painted windows
on the roof of the bus to make it look like one of them 23 window
jobbers. Also had a whale and rainbow painted on the side. A good job
too.
