Subject: The First Trip In a While

So I took maggie on our first trek in a while.  A rather short journey up
to the blue ridge mountains and Asheville, NC, from Raleigh.

I didn't see a single other bus, until I got to Asheville, where I saw
busses aplenty!  I'll bet there are more busses in Asheville (met
area=100,000 people) than all of the Raleigh-Durham area (met
are&gt;1,000,000).  I dunno, something about Asheville and busses goes
together nicely.  It's why it's my favorite town in the world.

Maggie ran great, even tho we had to take our time a little.  My new stereo
rocks.  (For the audio interested: average sony two shaft head unit, two
bottom of the line kenwood 4&quot; in the doors, and a bridged sony amp pushing
a 10&quot; blaupunkt subwoofer which is using the refrigerator compartment as
its enclosure) (and yes, I wired the head unit to the door buzzer circuit).

Did lots of MTB, saw old friends, and maggie still sleeps great.  Just wish
I had changed the shocks b/f I went...

Just thought ya'll might like to know...

Eric
