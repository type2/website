Subject: Clutch replacement parts 

If anyone on the list can help me here, I'd appreciate it.

On Thu, 22 Dec 1994, Joel Walker said that I said:
&gt; &gt;When I look at about $117 at NAPA and $292 and VW-MN, I'm realy inclined
&gt; &gt;to go with NAPA.  I agree with you to some degree about NAPA, but I can't
&gt; &gt;justify the $180 difference.

I guess I will get my clutch parts from NAPA or someone like them, but I 
want to know more than they do about what I need.  If anyone else has 
my combination of engine and transmission, I'd appreciate any help.

The one thing I can't seem to be sure of reading bentley and other info I 
have is whether or not I have a 228mm clutch plate.  Is there anywy for 
you to find that out?  The transmission is an 091/1 type DU (091301103D) 
and the engine is a type DH.

Also, Bentley says you have to remove the starter for an 091/1, but not 
for an 091.  Would someone who has an 091[/1] clue me in on whether 
there's a reason for that?

Thanks.
