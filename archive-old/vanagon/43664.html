Subject: flasher relay on '78

weirdness department:  my turn signal flasher began
to die.  the symptom was it would flash for 10 strokes
and then hang.  then it would only work for 7, then three,
then, at the end, one flash and then it would hang.  in
other words, a decline in vigor leading to coma.

i replaced it.  in the space of 10 days, it has repeated
the above pattern with the exception that it only affected
the left turn signal at first but it is now one flash and
hang either way including emergency/dual flashing.

it hangs with the dash light on (outside light off) if that
matters.

i will ascribe this to the inate animosity of inanimate objects
unless someone has a more interesting suggestion.

if my next replacement exhibits the same behavior, i will
consult druids.  if you are one, please send fee schedule.
