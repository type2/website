&gt; It's odd that the Corvair was driven out of production by alleged flaws in 
&gt; its handling capabilities.  Balderdash!

Only partly true, the early one's that Nader (is that a curse
word on a VW list? he didn't like us either) bitched about suffered
a typical VW problem, swing axle rear suspensions, after '64 or '65
or so they started using a full independent rear and were admitedly
very nice cars, a friend had a supercharged late Spyder, it was
wonderful and handled quite nicely, did leak oil though.
