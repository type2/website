Subject: BBTA-Northern Illinois Rest Stop

BBTA goers:

I'm not going to make it to Buses By The Arch, but anyone who is
going or returning via northern Illinois is welcome to stop by,
camp out or make necessary repairs at my place.  For NEATO/LiMBO
members, I'm in the TTT under DeKalb, Illinois.  For cyber
members, I'm at this email address and check my mail fairly
regularly.

I live on 3 acres (surrounded by corn field) and have room for
camping and a barn and tools for repairs.

-Jim Bryant

P.S. Vanagon owners:  The message is a cross-post, but the
P.S. is not.  If all goes well I may be picking up an '85
Wolfsburg Westfalia tomorrow morning.  $3200.  We'll see.
