&gt; Hey guys, Bob Dylan DOES have to do with vanagons!  Remember
&gt; the song he wrote, &quot;Blowin' in the Wind?&quot;  You may have thought
&gt; he intended it as a philosophical commentary, but he was REALLY
&gt; talking about the &quot;automatic lange change&quot; feature of vanagons
&gt; on the SF Bay Bridge on a windy day.    ;)

and don't forget the EARLY panel van on the cover of &quot;The Freewheelin'
Bob Dylan &quot;
