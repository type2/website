Subject: another camp toy!  (light)


Some of you who know me well will understand my fascination with this camping
accessory.  In a camper, I have profound admiration for devices which exhibit
duality of function - performing more than one task, but taking up the space
of only one.  This one does it!  It's a review from the Dec. 95 issue
of Camping and RV magazine, page 23.

Streamlight's Topspot II Instantly Converts from a Hand-Held Flashlight
to a Headlamp (ed. note:  I call these things &quot;gynocologist's lamps  :)

---

Norristown, PA - The TopSpot II from Streamlight, Inc. is a convertible
flashlight/headlamp, making it the perfect tool for a variety of applications
for the outdoor enthusiast.

According to Streamlight President Brad Penney, the Top Spot II was the first,
and continues to be the only flashlight that instantly converts from a hand-
held flashlight to a headlamp.

As a hand-held flashlight, TopSpot II's textured lighting - the polyfoam
padded lining and adjustable elastic offer comfort when worn around
the head.

A product engineered for a wide range of applications, the TopSpot II's 
shock resistant polymer construction, light weight (7.9 ounces with
batteries), and powerful spot-to-flood beam (3-7 times brighter than
other headlamps) make it ideal for snowshoers, cross country skiers,
fisherman and outdoor sports enthusiasts who need a flashlight when their
hands are busy elsewhere.  (ed. note:    ?  :) - that's what it says!).

The TopSpot II, featuring an operating time of up to 4.5 hours, is
powered by four AA batteries sold separately.  The light independently 
tilts 45 degrees for task targeting, and an optional snap-on lens can be
purchased to improve night vision.  The TopSpot II features an impact-
resistant bulb access cover and a compound action locking on/off switch designeto avoid accidental battery discharge.

The TopSpot II is available in professional gray or sport yellow, retails
for under $30.00 and is sold with a full one-year warranty.  A free
backup lamp providing up to 7.5 hours of additional light, is included
with purchase.  For further information, call toll free at 1.800.523.7488.

Streamlight, Inc., headquartered in Norristown, PA, manufactures a broad
line of high performance portable lighting products for outdoor, personal,
industrial, law enforcement, and fire fighting applications.
