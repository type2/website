Subject: Rubber gluing?

Howdy,

I recently replaced the top window rubber for the passenger side of my van.
 When I took off the old rubber, it was adhered to the front gasket
somehow.  Now there are two little flaps of rubber that should be glued to
the new gasket.

Any idea what sort of adhesive I should use?

Ron
