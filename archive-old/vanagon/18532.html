&quot;Adminsitrative Changes&quot; ??? Who reads that stuff anywho?? ;-)&lt;-embarassed
grin....

The problem I'm having ('cause I'm lazy...) is that the Porsche list, and
a couple of other lists I subscribe to all are doing the same thing...
and its a little too much like work to look at my mail directory and
figger out what I can toss and what I want to keep based on
&quot;name&quot; vs. list...

Oh well...I guess I'll just have to unsubscribe from this list!!! ....NOT!
