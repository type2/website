Subject: RE: Rabbit/Jetta engine swap

Long article that I posted about this would be in the archives.  Rest of my
scanty knowledge is that when you lean the Rabbit engine over like a diesel
you have to cut the body a little or use a Dasher intake manifold.  Some-
one else has to help you choose an appropriate donor engine; all I know is
bigger is better.

In other swap news, I'm about half-way through installation of the FI sys-
tem on my Vgon's 2.7 -- it's had the carburetors from the 2.2 till now.
No show-stoppers although changing the plugs or adjusting the intake valves
on the right side without taking the FI system back off is going to be no
fun.  Also the box I added on the engine access cover for the Porsche
engine's additional headroom is *just* wide enough.  Carbs are centered
on the engine, FI is mostly on the right.  I made the box with eight ad-
ditional inches of height and only need about four or five of that since
I hung the engine lower on the second installation.  Looking forward to the
FI with fingers crossed since the carbs were great on the highway but never
caught on to the smooth idle concept.
