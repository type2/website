Vanagoners:

	Another entry for the &quot;If it sounds too good to be true, it's NOT&quot;
department.
	Even though the State of Alabama (Baldwin County) authorities tagged and
titled the two 1997 beetles, they have now returned and &quot;impounded&quot; them
for further investigation.
	I have learned about some of this from a fellow worker who really wants
to buy one. I drove by yesterday and they are now off the road, in the
back of the lot, with &quot;sold&quot; signs on them. 
	Doesn't sound like they'll be on the road around here very soon :(
	The Mexican VW page (www.vw_dot_com.mx) shows only breadloafs, so I presume
they only have new Vanagons in South Africa (if there?) A new breadloaf
would be OK, but would only be business for the type 2 list.
