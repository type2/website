Subject: Ample Power Products?

Nothing in Seattle directory assistance for Ample Power Products -- anyone know where they're located? Thanks!

&gt;resistance of a battery which contains antimony, as does a deep cycle. I
&gt;might have read this in product literature from Ample Power Products of
&gt;Seattle (?) Washington--company that is fantatical about battery stuff for
&gt;using and monitoring batteries used on RVs and marine applications.
