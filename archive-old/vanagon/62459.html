Subject: new fuel press. reg. fixed idle too?
Date: Tue, 8 Jul 1997 09:51:02 -0400

Hi Volks,

Thought some might find it interesting that my wandering and racing idle
problem was also fixed when I *FINALLY*  found the &quot;running rich' problem
and replaced the fuel pressure regulator (again!) on the '86.

I had originally thought it to be the idle stabilizer and unplugged it. I
just cleaned the connector, plugged it back in an VIOLA!, idle fixed. Hmmm,
come to think of it, I wonder if it was a bad connection, didn't look dirty
tho'... Oh well, take it for what it's worth :-)
