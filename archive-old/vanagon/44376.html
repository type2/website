Subject: WTB: 73 Bus seats with headrest (Connectiuct area)

Wanted in Connecticut area:

73 bus front seats (driver &amp; passenger) with headrests (or at least with the
slots that accomodate headrests).  Condition of upholstery not important.

P.S.  I'll be at the Litchfield, CT show on the 23rd so you bring the seats,
I'll bring the butts and we'll rendezvous!
