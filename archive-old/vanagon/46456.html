Subject:      Re: A Freindly Wave

it's the Yuppie crowd ... the one's that caused the death of the bus as
we know it. :(  they don't wave at all. even in their Bimmers.

i wave at all the buses. but the Eurovans and the Vanagons RARELY ever wave
back. even some of the breadloafs look at me like i'm nuts.

but i did get a wave and peace-sign from a dark blue Eurovan the other day!
:)
