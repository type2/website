I have both new and used radiator fan motors in stock.  $175 gets you a new 
one.  Let me know if interested.

Subject:	&lt;syncro&gt;   rad fan motor

Hi,

Noticed the Syncros rad fan motor is identical Bosch to that in the SO's '86
Audi 5000Turbo, EXCEPT for the last of 9 parts numbers. xxx-yyy-203 vs. -204.
Will try for a junkyard Audi to pull (she's watching!) May bolt-in or be
only a minor tweak. Will repost.

Tim
