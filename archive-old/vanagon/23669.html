&gt; 	Diesel oil pump			154.95		 75.00
&gt; 	Diesel oil pan			   -		100.00

I'll agree this seems to be an &quot;easy&quot; conversion, and used Rabbit/Golf
engines are only $600 here.  It's one I thought I might try someday.  In
addition to the list above, I was thinking you might need these too: 

diesel Vanagon belhousing or an adaptor
diesel vanagon trans. input shaft (it's longer)
diesel vanagon flywheel (assuming the water boxer flywheel doesn't bolt 
to a Rabbit crankshaft)
right and left engine cradle bars
diesel vanagon tin bottom engine cover
if cis fuel injection, longer fuel lines

Oh yeah, watch out, those 2 liter Golf engines are about 3/4 inch taller.
