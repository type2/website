For those who just can't do the milas for the extensive tour of Baja, an
interesting alternative.  (Some degree of de ja vu here)

The weekend of Veterans Day 11NOV95.  Panamint Springs Resort is having
an open to all comers Chili Cookoff and general bash.  

Interested busmeisters could consider taking a day over, a day back and of
course days in between depending upon your commitments.  Possible adventures
involve visiting Saline Valley Warm Springs, just hanging out at PSR, walking
the fabled Darwin Canyon, visiting Scotty's Castle, Ubehebe Crater, Kelso
Dunes, Mahogany Flat Overlook, Telescope Peak (for the more adventurous) an
olfactory overload in the Trona Zone, the Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest
and other such enticements.

Suitable amounts of Mg could be burned, sufficient quantities of chili created
and consumed, and reminisces of the excellent summer shared amongst the 
participants.  

The annual armadillo heave is postponed due to equipment shortages.

Camping is ~$8/spot with HOT showers included, the pub serving Red Hook on 
draft is across the street next to the restaurant.  I could start a signup 
list as follows.
