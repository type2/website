Subject: Service manuals on CDs for Early VW

Here is a dialog, forwarded to me, from someone who sent a message to
Alldata requesting air-cooled VW repair CD's!

Lets start another barrage, to help push it along!

for all the info:

or email 

jeffery_at_alldata_dot_com

(Jeff Lagges - took over for Jonah Howell)
and tell him how much you would love to see air cooled VW repair manuals on
CD-ROM!

Thanks!

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Based on the heavy request I have been getting, it is certainly on our plans 
&gt;&gt;for future consideration.

&gt;&gt;Dear Sir,
&gt;&gt;       I am taking the time to write you and ask when you will be putting
&gt;&gt;out a line of CD's for those of us who will never own a newer vehicle. I
&gt;&gt;currently own several early VW automobiles, three 65 and older busses,
&gt;&gt;two 65 and older bugs and a 62 single cab.  I am truly interested in
&gt;&gt;manuals for my cars if and when you do produce them.  please notify me
&gt;&gt;when you have made a final dicision in reguards to these early classics.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Sicerely,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Nathan Moore
