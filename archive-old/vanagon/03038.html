&gt; What I meant was that these books I have read (&quot;How to rebuild your air-
&gt; cooled VW&quot;, and others) implied that the engines were *engineered* to have
&gt; the oil do a major part of the cooling.  Given that, I think changing 
&gt; to an oil with a lesser cooling capacity merits discussion.

Interesting considering the small amount of oil and cooler size used in
the stock setup.  Of course, you can invest all kinds of $$$ into a
aftermarket oil plumbing/cooling but I really think it is a waste of
money myself.  Others, I'm sure, disagree fanatically.  It's amazing
how much people will spend to maintain what really is a throw-away
engine.  But hey, who am I to judge?  Air is what is being used to
primarily keep the engine cool but oil is supplimenting this.  I guess
I can buy this.  Oh well....
