Hello-

FWIW
For any looking for ball park prices on any vehicle the Kelley Blue Book has
a web sit at    www.kbb_dot_com

You can look up suggested retail and suggested wholesale for any vehicle and
options back pretty far--maybe as far as 1980 or so. 

Of course these figures aren't written in stone. But it's a guide.
