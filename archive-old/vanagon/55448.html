Subject: Alternator &amp; EGR lights flashing?


Here's question that's beyond me.  Ever since I got my 1980 VW camper 
(last August), the alternator &amp; EGR lights would flash together and at 
the same rate.  They don't flash all the time, maybe 1 out of 3 short 
trips.  

I had the van worked on my a guy that knows vanagons pretty well, and he 
said not to worry about it.  Plus I just had a new battery put in three 
weeks ago, and they checked out the alternator, and it is fine.  

Also, I just noticed that the red light that is the fourth light to the 
bottom of the water lights(water tank) sometimes flashes at the same time 
too.  To be more specific it is behind the driver's seat, below the 
stove.  I think there are 3 lights for the water tank and the fourth one 
is something else.?

Anyway, if anyone has the same problem, or has any advice it would be 
helpful.  

Thanks,

	Kyle
