&gt; Below is the list of &quot;whites&quot; that I saw from several sources:
&gt; 
&gt; L87 Pearl White '58-'67  Beetle and Cab, Type2 and 3, KGhia TypeI/ Cabrio/3
&gt; 
&gt; L282 Lotus White '65-'71  Beetle, KGhia, Type2, Type3
&gt; 
&gt; L286 Turquiose White '61-'63  Beetle
&gt; 
&gt; L289 Blue-White 3/'61-'66 Beetle and Cab, Type2
&gt; 
&gt; L567 Ivory  '65-  Type2
&gt; 
&gt; L680 Cumulus White '65-'71 Beetle and Cab
&gt; 
&gt; No Number  Opal White '61-'63  Beetle
&gt; 
&gt; 
Where is Pastel White, Pastel Weib on the tags I think, I forget the
code but this has been the stock white for bumpers and roofs on all
late 70's I have ever seen.

PS I don't believe the pop tops were ever painted, I agree with the
gell coat scenario, and working with fiberglass has been my business
(or rather my research) for a few years now.
