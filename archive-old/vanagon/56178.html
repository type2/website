Subject: 83 Westy FS Santa Cruz Cal.

  Listees,

  I have a Westy for sale with a rebuilt engine (15K ago) all tables, curtains etc are 
present.

  The van is the Tan color of the era and all in all the van is in really good shape. 
 This van is a California car, so rust is not present.

  I took it out and drove it about 25 miles the other day, then I jumped into another 
westy to take it on iit's LONG test drive.  I was amazed how the 83 OUT Handled the 
later model westy!  I know that tires have a whole lot mof difference in the way that 
a van handles, but I think it was more than that.

  I would like to sell this van to someone who will get a whole lot of enjoyment out 
of this van.  The people that own it, that I'm selling it for have owned it since day 
1!  We're asking $4800.00 for this van, many reciepts etc.  

  Anyone wanting more details on this van, e-mail me or phone me in the afternoons, 
PST.  Thanks.

  Kyle
