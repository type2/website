AD??

I switched wire harness to the air flow box - and the problem persists.  My
mechanic thinks it is the air flow box  -  


Has any one replaced one of these???

Thanks to all of you for your continued help.

Also, even though I replaced the Idle Reg,  The idle seems to not want to
stabalize.  Could this be
due to the Air box or possibly the temp. control relay -   

I did replace the fuel filter (very exciting)


I am at a loss.  


Any and all help --- please
