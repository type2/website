Subject: Re: lead &amp; valves


Are you sure? When I drive more than five upfilled tanks with
unleaded gas I start hearing the work of my vents. When I filled
up with leaded gas it stops. So I'm driving with relations of
1 leaded to 3 unleaded.

My Vanagon is (exactly: was) a '80 German 2L carburated aircooled.
But I guess there are differences in heads to the US versions.

When did the US change to the CAT equipped vehicles? As I remember
the fuel companies started to add lead to gas in the sixties
because of the coming high powered engines in this years. That
was a cheap way in the past, why should VW go another way than
it's competitors? In the late seventies man recognize that lead
cause problems in the environment and leaded gas can not be used
within vehicles equipped with catalytic converters.

Any other thoughts?

VW Hasn't made a head that required leaded fuel since late 1967.  The
valve seats on all Type IV motors included.  Don't worry about it.  You
have other problems with dropping seats that are more directly related
to the cooling and expansion of the head (which was more prevalent in
the later 2000cc heads).
