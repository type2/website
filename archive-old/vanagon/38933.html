&gt;I vaguely remember someone mentioning that they figured out how to brighten
&gt;the backup lights on their van.  Can anyone remember this?  (I couldn't find
&gt;it in the archives.)

there are two ways that i know of:
- buy some of these little halogen backup bulbs ... they fit direct replacement
   of the normal bulbs. don't know how bright they are (supposedly, they are at
   least twice as bright)

- then, there's MY way. :)
   i installed a clear foglight on top of the bumper and rigged a relay and
   switch on the dash. now, this method will light up the world behind you like
   you cannot imagine. :)  like, 500 feet out behind you and way off to the
   sides. you can actually SEE behind you, and can backup at about 20 mph if
   you want to. and anybody behind you KNOWS you're gonna do something!!

   that's the good part. the bad parts are:
   - cost. you're likely to have to buy TWO fog lights. they usually come in a
     &quot;kit&quot;. so save the 2nd one for a &quot;spare&quot;. :)
   - running that wire all the way up front. :( of course, you COULD put the
     relay in the engine compartment somewhere and just hook the wire into the
     regular backup light. this way, any time you shifted into reverse, the big
     foglight would come on. i chose not to do it this way, so i didn't have
     the light coming on during daylight.
   - you need to be aware that the glass reflector will most likely have to be
     filled upside down (the instructions should tell you about this) cause of
     the above-bumper mounting. otherwise the light pattern will not be right
     for backing up (you'll light up the tops of the trees!)

on the whole, i definitely think it's worth it.
