Subject: Aladin's Treasure Cave in Renton?

	Hi all,
	First, let me tall you that there is a very cool thing
up near Seattle, the Boeing Company Surplus Sale Building. Its
at South 208th and 84th Ave South, in Renton, I believe, and
open Tuesday-Friday 10-5, Saturday 9-4. Their info line is 206 393 4062
and that's got directions and hours, you can talk to a person there
at 206 393 4065.

	What they sell is whatever scraps they have left from making
airplanes, etc, and I'm told its pretty much price by the pound. They have
aluminum, steel, wires, cables, insulations, upholstry, carpet, plastic, etc,
as well as bins full of back issues of Aviation Week and Space Technology
and all kinds of other wacky things. Makes me want to visit.

	However, I'm not close to being able to go visit yet. So
what I was wondering was, would someone from the Seattle area go
there for me and get me about $10 worth of big, interesting,  carpet scraps? 
Then box it and UPS it down? I think I remember the price being $1/lb
last time Ian was there, so this would be $10 worth of stuff, in
a cardboard box maybe 12-14lb UPS'ed to me. I can write you a check
up-front and buy your lunch if you want.

	I need liners for my new tool box drawers, and I figure 
lightwieght, long-wearing airliner carpet would make beauts! It comes,
I presume, in all those wonderful vivid colors that are sometimes
used in airliners, and I could also give the extra as gifts at Christmas.

	If $10 worth sounded like a big hassle, but a smaller amount
would be do-able, I need enough for 6 drawers, each 22 inches long and
about 8 inches wide.

	And yes, as a matter of fact, doesn't this sound like
a great place to get stuff to customize one's bus/transporter/camper?
Aluminum for solar-cell racks, etc?


	No time for the heat exchangers last night :( Tonight
or tomorrow morning, I fervently hope. Full report when I know
something!
