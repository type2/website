&gt;And another thing. What are piston skirts actually for, anyway? What do
&gt;they do that a simple cylinder shape wouldn't do? Because by the time I
&gt;filed twelve grams off the sucker there warn't a whole lot of skirt left. I
&gt;haven't put that engine back together yet but if I filed off something
&gt;important I'm gonna be pissed.

The piston skirts keep the pistons striaght in the bore as they travel in the
cylinders. They support the piston a fight the side load the connecting rod
palces on them.  A full lenth piston would increase wieght and friction.
 Remember the goal is to keep recipricating mass as low as possible.  Piston
skirt design is a science in itself.
