Subject: Used Bus Bits reminder
Date: Wed, 07 Feb 1996 22:51:28 -0700
From: Dieter Dworkin Muller &lt;dworkin_at_village_dot_org&gt;


This is a quick reminder that Demented Dworkin's Used Bus Bits web
page exists at http://www.village_dot_org/vw/parts.  It's intended as a
place for vanagon_at_lenti members to announce parts they'd like to have
or get rid of.

I've noticed several requests for moderately-obscure parts go by.  If
you want a listing on the Used Bus Bits page, you must mail it to me
(dworkin_at_village_dot_org) directly.  There are several reasons for this,
but the main ones are timeliness (I batch-read mail from the list one
or twice a week) and explicitness (some people don't want to be
listed, and I don't want to guess wrong).

Share and Enjoy.

	Dworkin
