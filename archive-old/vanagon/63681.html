Bled the brakes last Sat., no leaks, getting prepped for our first camp 
this coming weekend, drove it to dinner last night  - it's leaking again! 
 My husband checked all the checkable things - which looked fine.  

Anyone else had similar fun?  We're thinking the next stop is 
slave/clutch-related.

Hi'yer, Debbie,

Same problem here, same symptoms, and yes, it turned out to be the slave cylinder.

I took it to BA Wackerli's ( local VW Dealer, great guy there named Klaus ), and voila, no problem.  Hasn't leaked since.

Here's what they charged me:

Repair Replace Slave Cylinder - 52.00
Slave Cyl - 79.95
Brake Fl. - 6.55
Misc Shop Mat'ls - 2.60
Total - 145.43

Yar, it costs a bit, but the ToochMobile hasn't leaked a drop since!

Best o' luck to ya.
