Subject: re: Today's Tailgating Adventure (F)

I have followed the tailgating thread this week with some humorous interest.
Today on the way to work I pulled out into traffic in the curb most lane and
signaled to merge into the center lane in order to go to the &quot;Point B&quot; spot
which was the freeway entrance that I longed for in my heart. We are talking
3/4 of a mile distance here folks. I clearly saw that three cars were behind
me in the lane of my desire. Instead of cutting them off I let the first two
go by and noticed that the third was &quot;way&quot; back. I continued to signal and
as I was now up to speed I merged left to continue on with my humble
existence. Mr. sexually frustrated middle-aged anglo and would really like
to kick my boss' butt came flying up to my bumper (in his
tan/bland/&quot;whiteguy&quot; flesh colored 4 door mid '80's K car)and peeled off
into the right lane in fighter pilot &quot;my manhood is greater than yours&quot;
fashion. This was ridiculous as the distance caused a major time delay
between my entering the lane and his strafing raid. As he passed, he must
have been driving with his &quot;manhood&quot; as his hands and arms were flaping and
his neck veins were popping out like firehoses. I merely shrugged my
shoulders and lifted my arms in the &quot;W'sup?&quot; fashion, laughed and went on
with life. Why is it that folks in smallish cars think that they can
&quot;virtually&quot; push you out of the way? I think Dr. Freud would have something
to say about this whole TAILGATING issue. Oooooh! Love your bumper! ;)
