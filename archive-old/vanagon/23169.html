I want one to 'show' my wife's sister.  She has a 'new' 500 series.  We 
had five adults and she wanted us to squeeze in that instead of my '93 
EV.  We all looked at the BMW and than we looked at the EV.  We took the 
EV.  Love to see her eyes if I pull up in 'my' new BMW.  I always wanted 
a BMW cycle anyway.
