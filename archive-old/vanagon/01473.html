Subject: Re: expensive heater boxes

On the question of installing heater boxes-- much of buying the right 
boxes depends on three things - whether or not you have a catalytic 
converter, whether or not you have an O2 sensor and whether or not your 
system is equiped with an EGR takeup 
before or after the box. Having both, neither or either will change the 
type and location of the left hand heater box, I know because it was hard 
to find the right exhaust manifold for that side when I was rebuilding 
the engine for my 1982 Westfalia. Since air pollution control varies from 
country to country and state to state  and over time I would be wary 
about a) using 914 heater boxes and b) buying US boxes for a Canadian van

At any rate check your system for those components and check against the 
heater boxes you plan to buy. Haynes has a pretty picture of it in their 
manual for  air-cooled Vanagons. DC
