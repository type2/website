&gt; &gt;needing one for about a week. Thanks in advance - David Carment

I remembered someone posting about a Westy rental company earlier, so I
searched the archives and came up with Tom Brouillette, who runs a service
called &quot;Roamin' Holiday&quot; in Albuquerque, NM.  I know it's not the Bay
Area or San Diego, but it might be a good place to start.
