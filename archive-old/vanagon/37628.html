&gt; (from Automobile mag. 10 anniv. issue, p91) &quot;The (Chrysler) minivan
&gt; is an original.  Sure, the Volkswagen Microbus was space efficient,
&gt; but it was also exceedingly slow and very dangerous.  (the
&gt; designer's) concept put the mechanicals, not people's legs, out
&gt; front....yadada yadada etc.&quot;

     HEH!!! I notice from the plate on the side of my '76 that
     it turned TWENTY YEARS OLD last month -- does ANYONE
     from &quot;Automobile&quot; magazine believe that ANY Chrysler
     minivan is going to be rolling as a daily driver in 20 years?!?!?

Sure - but it might be in the form of 2-3 H*nda C*v*cs (after its 
recycled, of course...)   ;-)

I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
