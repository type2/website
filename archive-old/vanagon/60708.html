Subject: Leaking crank pully seal.

Greetings,

After having my newly aquired 87 westie syncro checked out yesterday, I
was informed of a few problems... Some of which Im going to try to fix
myself (this is a bold venture, as my greatest mechanical feat ever was
to install a starter on an 82 toyota pickup).

Im taking the van in to have the air con fixed before my Bentley will
get here, so Id like to know if I should have my mechanic fix some of
these problems at that time, or if I should give em a shot myself when i
get the manual.

1)  Flush the power steering and clean the filter (I downloaded the
    instructions from the faq, think I can handle this one).

2.  Engine oil drain plug is leaking - Guess Ill wait till i change the
    oil again and see if the bolt is stripped?  Its barely leaking.

*****3.  Crank pully seal is leaking - ??? will this be difficult? *****

4.  Transmission leaking at left axle flange and shifter seal.  The
    transaxle was replaced just prior to me buying the van, and its
    still under warrenty, so i think German Transaxle will honor that
    and pay for labor...all directions on the warrenty have been
    followed. i.e. correct oil, tires all the same, etc...

5.  Small seapage of heads, also seaping into #4 plug, which sounds like
    a cracked cylander.  I think Ill take my chances on this on till it
    goes, then put a new (subaru?) engine the sucker.  I knew about the
    heads prior to buying the van, so no surprise here.

Peace,

Jeff
