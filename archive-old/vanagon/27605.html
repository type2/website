Subject: Heavy-duty, rear, permanent, rack question

 I have been thinking about bus expeditions lately, and carrying extra
fuel and tires, and I have an idea that I am considering. MAny jeeps and
other like vehicles have a swing-arm type rack across the rear, which
can carry a spare tire, plus 2 five gallon jerry cans. The swing feature
allows access to the rear hatch. I am toying with doing such a thing for
my '67, but wonder if it would be safely possible to attach such a burly
thing to her tender rear. Anyway, if anyone has any thoughts on this, I
would be curious...
