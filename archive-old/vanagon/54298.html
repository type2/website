&gt;Well, here's the report on my recent brake bleeding adventure.

&gt;My record is intact!  BTW That is NOT a good thing.
&gt;
&gt;I still have air somewhere in the lines.

In your bleeding procedure, I don't remember you saying that you had someone
press down on the pedal with the bleeder closed, then you open the bleeder
allowing the pedal to go to the floor, at that point you close the bleeder
and tell the person to release the brake pedal.  The reason is that the
bleeder screw doesn't always fit that tight in the threads and air can be
drawn in around the threads on the upstroke unless the bleeder is closed,
regardless of one-way valves, etc. in the hose.  Just a suggestion.
