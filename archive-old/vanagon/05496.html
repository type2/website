So Jim Macklow says:
&gt; 
&gt; Well, considering I've seen '89 - '91 Syncro Westies in the paper for
&gt; sale at SF Bay area VW dealerships for $17K - $21K, I thought his price
&gt; was laughable.  But, I suppose he'll be the one with the smile on his
&gt; face when someone coughs up the dough.  Between the dealers and private
&gt; parties that advertise in the SF Chronicle, there always seems to be
&gt; about 2-3 Syncro Westies, and another 1-2 Syncro Transporters advertised
&gt; in the Friday news.  They don't seem to be _that_ rare around here.
&gt; 
&gt; -Jim
&gt; 

True, but I guess it depends on the shape it's in.  $24K is a bit steep
but I think he can get it or close to it.  I wished I'd bought a Syncro.
