Subject: Re: Compression test

Is it true that depending on the equipment used, a compression test may
vary quite a bit?  Like up to 50?

&gt; You can get some idea if it is rings or valves by
&gt; adding a tsp of oil to the cylinder and repeating the compression test.
&gt;  Think compression will go up with oil if it is the rings  but maybe someone
&gt; can confirm this.

This is correct.
