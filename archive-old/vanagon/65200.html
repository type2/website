Subject:      Odd use for a EV MV...

Anyone ever carry an odd animal in their Eurovan?

Thhe pygny goats in the extra large dog carrier was interesting BUT...

How about a full grown American breed llama?

Just popped out the rear facing seats and it worked just fine.  I guess
he did have to keep his head down unless he was kneeling.  We did get
some odd looks from other cars.
