	Ed,
	Those are awesome compression numbers- they also seem
a bit high, but what's most important is that they're all
VERY close to each other. (Yeah, and if they were all 60 I'd
worry, but 150 +4/-2 is excellent). IMHO anyway. The absolute
values suggest your engine has a 11.x:1 compresison ratio with
is highly unlikely ( standard air pressure is 14.7lb/in2  so
0-147 lb is 1:1..1:11. )

	I'm afraid $32 isn't that far from what I paid for cylinders
for my 77 Rabbit. You might try some of the mail-order shops. The Bus
Stop (Rocky Mountain Motor Works) lists your cylinders for $12.75
each (Page 52, item 6). They list the bleeder valve and dust cap
separately, at $2.25 and 2.49 respectivly, so you're looking
at about $18 for what I consider 'complete'.

	The Bus Stop have been good to me so far. 800 544 5357.


	Type IV engine pushrod tube leaks are easy fixes, but you've got a
type II, like my '70, I believe (upright fan?) and it sure looks harder
to deal with to me. Like you have to loosen the cylinder heads to
replace the pushrod tube/seal. There are two-piece tubes on the market
that promise to allow this change without loosening the head. I've
never tried it. Anyone else? With the two piece tube, I presume you
take off the rocker, pull out the pushrod and just bend the old tube
to get it out.

	Cheers!
	Bill
