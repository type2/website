&gt; Iagree, that we should all try to meet in St. Louis, and then go
&gt; traipsing about the east coast. Perhaps if we could all get together and
&gt; figure something out. I for one can suggest perhaps driving/camping the
&gt; Blue Ridge Parkway, or perhaps the Outer Banks...

Timing of the whole leg is bad for me.  The Blue Ridge though is my old home 
turf and would be interested in at least that part. (Now I'm just south 
of DC)
