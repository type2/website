&gt;I noticed that in the Bentley manual, that there are various
&gt;gas auxilary heaters that work through the normal vent channels.
&gt;The specific heater system I'm referring to attaches under
&gt;the vanagon and is routed into the ducting somehow.

&gt;Now can this system also be used for stationary uses e.g. camping?

as long as you don't park in a pile of leaves or tall grass.

&gt;And why wasn't this option available in the U.S.?

i believe it was, but like so many 'options', our slimeball-salesforce didn't
care to mention it in most places (like california, alabama, etc.)

&gt;I'd presume it was a safety issue, but I don't know for sure.

nah. stupidity and slovenliness.

&gt;Can anyone enlighten me more about these systems

Enlightenment must come from Within, grasshopper. :)

&gt;and if there is a possibility of integrating one into my van,
&gt;I'd like to hear about it.

if you've got the money, honey, someone's got the time. :) check with that
Mirvis guy in new jersey and see what's available.
