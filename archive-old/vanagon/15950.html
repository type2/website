Subject: Re:Tach was The Berg and springs

&gt;The other question is : is the oil pressure sender hole on the VW case 
&gt;tapped 1/8&quot; npt?  Are we talking something strange?  I know that there are T 
&gt;adapter out there, but I was wondering if I could go to my local hardware 
&gt;store for one.
&gt;

Yes, 1/8 national pipe thread.  Something strange indeed, how did those
germans find out about NPT?  Wouldn't they have used a metric equivalent?
I've always wondered about that.  

Local hardware store should have it, I've also found them at the local Home
Depot in the bitsy hardware section.

Sincerely,
Eugene
