Ric asks about the missing '92 EuroVan (Don't let PJ see you write that...):

&gt;Did we loose that 92 EuroVan??  When did that happen?


I believe that the T4 in question is the 1.9 L, 4-cyl oil burner belonging
to &quot;El Bushrat Grande&quot;, PJ(rats, I forgot his last name :(  ), who wandered
off to England for the holidays (I think...)

Anyway, I don't think he wanted to wade through a zillion e-mails from the
vanagon list when he got back, so he probably unsubscribed.

I hope he's back soon; like the rest of the folks on this list, he's got
a wealth of knowledge and is damn entertaining to boot.
