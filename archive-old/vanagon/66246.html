Subject:      Radio Codes

Radio codes for VW come in two flavors: Old and New

Old: On these radios the codes can be changed and even turned off by the
owner. They also only give you 3 chances untill it locks up more or less
perminantly. The only way to unlock one of these is to bring it to a dealer
(friendly or not) and then they send it out to the radio Mfg.

New: These codes are burned in by the radio Mfg and come on a card when the
car is sold from the dealer. The code can not be changed. But if you miss it
three times in a row then it only locks up for a few hours before it gives
you another three chances. Since the code comes from the dealer they MAY
have recorded it somewhere and will give it to you (maybe)

Old ones are mostly on vanagons before 89
New ones all Eurovans and late Vanagons
