 SyncroBeast           Avatar's??
Well, now I know what an Avatar is.  It's the symbol to the left of my
Nickname on the Chat area.  And aparently they look like this:  &gt;&gt;What the
&quot;Avatars&quot; look like:  http://www.gj_dot_net/~bhkraft/avatars.gif&lt;&lt;.

I still can't get one, and I still can't get past the pick one page so I'm
still wondering if the chat system is up and running or not, and if so what is
needed to get from here to there.

&gt;I get the same thing as you. I think we need to download a newer version of
&gt;something (?).
&gt;I don't have a clue about what the heck an Avatar is but I think it's
&gt;something like an icon. I'll be interested in the answers.

It's one of those VW thingies that would be next to my nickname,
if I could get past the &quot;pick an Avatar&quot; point.  I have Win 3.1 and
MSIE 3.02 with Virtual Machine for Java.  That oughta crash real good.

The Chat area is at:  http://www.vanagon_dot_com/

What is an Avatar, and why can't I get one?  Or is the Chat box on V_at_com not
up yet?  I get the following, and kick back to the pick an Avatar and type a
nickname screen.

&gt;&gt; Java script error:  ......no properties. &lt;&lt;
