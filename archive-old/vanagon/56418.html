Subject: Re: Go with the door sticker.....


&gt; &gt;I just bought a set of reinforced Michelin X tires for my 86 Westfalia. The
&gt; &gt;max tire pressure is 40 psi, yet the sticker on the door calls for 48 psi in
&gt; &gt;the rear tires. The dealer (Wheelworks, a large chain in the SF Bay Area)
&gt; &gt;insists that they are the correct tires. What's going on here?
&gt; 
&gt; The tire recommendation is for a wide range of vehicles, including cars. 
&gt; The sticker is for that tire on your individual vehicle 
&gt; 
&gt; You have a much heavier van.
&gt; 
&gt; I inflated to the door sticker pressure, despite the 40psi on my tires.
&gt; 
&gt; Just my opinion.

The door sticker on my '88 Westy says:

For 185r14 REINFORCED tires: 30/40 psi front/rear
For 195/75r14 6PR LT tires: 39/48 psi front/rear

So you ARE ok with 40 psi if they are REINFORCED. If they don't say 
it, they probably aren't (and should not be used).

btw: I ran my re-inf. tires at max pressure all round, as they were 
too soft. I now run LT load range C/D tires at 39-50 psi depending on 
conditions and loading.
