Subject: RE: #3 retard


&gt; I have the original distributor.  Various sources tell me that these
&gt; distributors retard the #3 spark by 4 degrees to keep that cylinder from
&gt; over-heating due to the warmer air it received from the non-dog-house
&gt; oil cooler.  If I put on a dog-house cooler, should I get a new 
distributor
&gt; that doesn't have #3 retarded?  I expect the engine would run smoother.(?)
&gt;
&gt; I've heard about the #3 retard too, but I think you may have the reasoning
&gt; backwards. I don't think that the retard will keep it from overheating,
&gt; but it will help prevent pre-ignition and detonation caused by the higher
&gt; temperatures that #3 is likely to experience.
&gt;
&gt; Perhaps Dr. Hoover can advise us all to what is really going on with this.
&gt; Does anyone know if the '71 and later distributors have #3 retarded?


The retarded #3 is one of the 009 centrfugal-only distributor's
claims to fame. You can see it if you swap your timing light from
#1 to #3. Any others?
