Subject: 83 Sink's 12V water pump

Yesterday I decided to improve the recently slowed delivery of water 
coming from my '83 Westie's sink spigot, so I pulled the pump.  After 
much agitation by shaking it along its shaft while it was running and 
hearing lots of micro grinding noises, it was spinning much faster, but 
just before I was about to quit satisfied, it demonstrated its 
dissatisfaction by quiting.  The motor is now electrically open, so I'd 
say it's &quot;toast.&quot;
  If someone knows of a device that also uses this standard appearing 12V 
DC electric motor, that would be nice information.
  Also, in what interchangable years were these little submergable pumps 
used?
  Is there an inexpensive alternate source for acceptable replacements 
beside the maximally priced VW dealership?
  If others have found nice little two speed replacements, that would be 
a fine improvement.

  Any discussion would be welcome.  Thankzzzz
  John Wakefield
