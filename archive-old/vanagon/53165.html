Subject: Rust Coating

Volks:

The '89 Syncro was Ziebarted every year by the
previous owner - except for last year when the
bus was parked for the winter. It might be fair to
say there is no rust. See &quot;ps&quot; for details.

Should I give C$150 to Ziebart for the annual
protection or look to another company? 

I have an appointment for Wednesday,
December 18th at noon and since I am on
&quot;digest&quot;  direct replies to &lt;kubikd_at_em.agr_dot_ca&gt;
would be appreciated.

PS
I have noticed that:
-when doing a recent brake job  - a slight knock
with a wrench chipped  the coating off;

-the front bumper tube is showing signs of
&quot;browning&quot; in one spot ( &lt; 1 inch sq)  and  when
I removed the air dam for the winter it looked
like no coating was sprayed inside the bumper
tubing.

Another 1/2 inch sq area below  the water tank
filling port is also browning.
