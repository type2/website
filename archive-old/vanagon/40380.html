Subject: WTB 1970+ Van.....


I KNEW I shouldn't have let my son drive the EV....two weeks ago he was 
contented with the idea that my old GTI would be his first car....now he is 
pestering me for a VW Van...or maybe even a Camper....

So, anyone up here in the Mass/RI/CT/NH area have a line on something in 
somewhat solid shape, preferably with a blown engine for around $1,200 or 
so?
