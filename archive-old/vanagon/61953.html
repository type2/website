Peter,

What kind of oil and oil filter are you using?

&gt; 
&gt; Any knowledge of oil pressure sensor problems?  When the engine warms up
&gt; to operating temperature, the oil presure light goes on when i slow down
&gt; from above 2000 rpm.  as soon as it goes to 2000 rpm the oil light goes
&gt; on and won't shut off till i go above the 2000 rpm.  could i not be
&gt; getting correct oil pressure at the lower rpm, or do you think the
&gt; switch is bad (high one or low one)  any help would be appreciated.
