Subject: 85 Westy fridge removal

BeyondMail Form: Message
Text: 
Hi All, I've established that my fridge doesn't work on 120V.
I've also phoned around to the dealerships listed in my VW manual as 
&quot;factory authorized dealers&quot; but they no longer handle these parts or 
repairs. What I'd like to do is take out the fridge myself and try to 
troubleshoot the problem.

Can anyone tell me how to get the fridge out and if I can figure out what's 
wrong, where to get the parts.

Thanks.....Harry ( '85 Westy)
