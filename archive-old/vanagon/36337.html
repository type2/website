&gt;My next two or three areas of exploration, in order:
&gt;1. The oil pressure sensor plug.
&gt;2. A bad ground somewere.
&gt;3. A bad relay unit somewhere (I haven't looked at the electrical
&gt;schematics yet to see how the circuit runs. I think it's pretty simple,
&gt;from what I remember of my 70's vans).
&gt;Someone also suggested I clean out the oil pressure regulator with a
&gt;toothbrush(I don't remember this part--hope it's easy to get to. Hey,
&gt;wonder if it's that big screwlike plug on the bottom rear left of the
&gt;engine. Bentley will tell me.).

Your van has two oil pressure switches.  They are not interchangeable.  One
is mounted between the push rods on the driver side the other is way under
the oil pump.  The &quot;Dynamic Oil Pressure&quot; control unit is mounted to the
speedometer.  See Bentley manual for operation of this system.

Dennis.
