I also lived in my 71' bus for a summer.  Between high school and freshman 
year 
in college.  Unfortunately it wasn't a camper.  I didn't have any trouble 
parking on city streets in St. Paul.  My favorite area was Grand Ave.  Tons 
of students and most of my friends had apartments there also, they were 
pretty sick of me using their showers and stuff by the end of the 
summer, though.  I couldn't complain but I couldn't do it again, even 
with our westy's working fridge and stove,etc.

I must be getting old.
