Subject: '87 westy head leak update
Date: Sun, 11 Feb 1996 07:24:04 -0500 (EST)

Well, yesterday I went about changing the leaking head gasket after
checking all the options and suggestions so graciously given by a few of
the list members it was determined it was definitely the head gasket leak.
After getting the head off the problem was apparent, major pitting on the
rubber gasket sealing surface on the head.  I took an orbital vibrating sander
to it with 80 grit paper and it cleaned up nicely and the remaining pit
holes I think will be filled up by the silicone head gasket goo.  Then I
removed the cylinders to change the two o-rings on them, the top one was
toast and the groove had to be cleaned with a hack saw blade.  The bottom
one came out cleanly.  THEN when trying to install the cylinders I broke
the oil ring on the first try so the game was over for the day.  No rings
available on a Saturday in Ottawa - Moday morning at the earliest - so I'm
waiting and thinking and it looks like now I will re-ring the two pistons
since the engine has 200 k on it and I'm this far into it.  I suppose I'll
have to do the other side even though it isn't leaking - yet !  I suppose
I'll find the same pitting of the head there also.  Gasket set for one
head at Autoimport in Ottawa was $138 and the rings I won't know until
Monday.  I'll post the results next week after I'm back on the road.  One
other note the tail pipe piece I got from Cajun Tire back in the spring of
94 is now tost, rusted beyond description !  However the muffler which
came from them also still looks good !

Cheers

Frank
