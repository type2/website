Subject: Re: Remote starter button how to hook-up vanagon?

Looking at Bentley page 97.62 it appears you want to hook to starter
terminal #50 and starter terminal #30. Terminal #30 will provide +12
volts to soloniod terminal #50 when you complete the circuit.
Check it out
Good Luck

&gt;Still another question, I need to me able to turn the motor over using 
&gt;the
&gt;a starter button on the vanagon. Working along need to know. Do you 
&gt;have to
&gt;hook direct to the starter (if so I guess hook the + to the term.30 
&gt;and the
&gt;- to ?) or can you do it closer in the engine compartment?
