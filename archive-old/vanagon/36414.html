Subject: 87 Syncro - Is it my air box $$$

I have yet to try out the second wire harnes but, one thought is that my 
air box may be the problem.  Any one every replace one of theses???

How much??? and who's a good supplier???

The new wire harnes may be the fix on the stalling out.  All grounds seem to
be fine.

Please Help
