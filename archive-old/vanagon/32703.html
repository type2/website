&gt; Subject: Call for Papers: Journal of Vanagon Addiction

&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; I guess some of the newsletters do this, but since I haven't
&gt; yet joined limbo, I don't know how detailed they get.  I
&gt; used to belong to SOTO, but well, you know, the newsletter
&gt; seemed like a one-van show back then.

I understand your desire to &quot;journal&quot; the brick and in many
cases, that is being done in the LiMBO newsletter.  Your
experience with SOTO is similar to mine (and the reason I
switched to and stayed with NEATO).

&gt; &lt;more snip&gt;
&gt; You know how it is, sometimes an idea just sparks you and
&gt; you toss it right out into the wind. Some float. Some fall.
&gt; Such is life.

All that is needed for your idea to fly is an &quot;editor&quot;.
Someone who will sift through the chaff, locate the nuggets
of wisdom, seek and recieve the appropriate permission,
format the text, correct the spelling and grammar, track
down corresponding photographs or diagrams, find a
publisher, review the proofs and, and, and.  Sounds like
work.  You volunteering?
