Subject: Probe 'n Drogue ???

Neat to hear from Bob about how the extra tankage is working out. And, to say
again how much I enjoy hearing about how these things/trips work out and go.  

Gotta wonder though, with Bob's background has he considered being a &quot;Texaco&quot;
for the Inuvik run?  Wonder what form it will take, Probe 'n Drogue, flying
boom (But then who would be his &quot;boomie&quot;?) . . . .????  :-)

(With apologies to Bob - I just couldn't resist !  :-)    )

Harvey
