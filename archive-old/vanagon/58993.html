&gt; Subject:       Sliding Door Problem Fixed

&gt; The sliding door was sticking on my 1990 Vanagon, Wolfie. I cleaned the
&gt; tracks, lubed everything, and still couldn't get the door open without
&gt; pulling on the bottom rear edge of the door. Last night, I sprayed WD-40
&gt; on the rubber gaskets surrounding the door lip and the door no longer
&gt; sticks. I will have to get out the soap and water to really clean the
&gt; door gasket.
&gt; 
For the first time, this happened to me today. I was inside the van 
already, so I pushed out on the door &amp; the lower seal slowly let 
loose. When I drove it last 3-4 days back, it was in the pouring 
rain, so I guess the gasket really stuck. I suspect silicone spray 
may be better for rubber than wd-40, although I don't know for sure.
