Hi everyone,
	I have a problem that is driving me absolutly crazy.  Here are 
the symptoms:  Sometimes when driving the van loses most, say 80% to 
100%, of its power.  As long as it remains in gear I can floor the gas 
peddle and it will barely move.  As soon as I put the clutch in it will 
usually die. Sometimes it will struggle to stay running at around 500rpm 
before it dies.
	Also, as soon as I recognize that I have lost power I can put the 
clutch in turn the ignition off then on, and let the clutch out.  This 
remedys the problem for a bit but it inevitably happens again.
	This has almost always occured when it is wet and/or cold 
outside, although it has happened once when it was warm and sunny.
	The ECU has been replaced, and the air/flow wiring harness has 
been installed.  Might this be the O2 sensor?  Or some other sort of 
temperature sensor?  Or is it a short as a result of water in a bad 
place?  It seems that it might be related to the computer since when I 
turn it off and then on, the problem goes away for awile.  If any of you 
have any ideas about this or have experienced something similar, please 
help me.  Many thanks in advance.
