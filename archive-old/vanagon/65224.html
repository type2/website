&lt;&lt; Having searched the archives religiously to no avail, I am
 broadcasting this request for radio recommendations for a '84 Vanagon.
 The current &quot;SparkOMatic&quot; radio the DPO installed is awful. I remember
 seeing something about a limited depth of the dash space for the
 vanagon radio, so I am wondering what radios actually fit, IOW, what
 is the maximum depth the radio can go?
  &gt;&gt;
Hi, I have a Pansonic CQE15ECU usual AM/FM Cassette detachable faceplate,
digital display.  I have not finished its installation yet as I have gotten
sidetracked by projects at the rear end of my 84 Westie, but I have test fit
it and it will fit.  From the back of the faceplate to the back of the
chassis is just a hair under 6 inches in depth.  The specs call it 5 7/8
inches.  This seemed to be one of the few DIN mount units I found that was
shallow enough to fit.  I got a whale of a deal on it, $99, but I think it
normally goes for more like $149.  In the store, Best Buy, and mocked up on
the bench, it seems to have a decent sound to me, not much different than the
Pioneer Supertuners I have liked in the past.  From the price range you can
probably draw some conclusion about how serious an audiophile I am (not).
