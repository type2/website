        I'v gleaned all of this info on 25/36 hp engines,
        from the list to put it in one file (save space)

        And no one has mentioned the spark plug wire tube,
        Is this an after market item????

no, not an aftermarket item.  It was used on 25hp AND early 36hp motors.
  &quot;later&quot; 36ers had big rubber plugs, not the plastic clips,  that held the
wires to the fan housing. 

we are taling 25hp differnces to 36hp, right?  Not differences between
36hp/25hp, relative to the 40hp/1600.
