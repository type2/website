&gt; &gt; If the battery shows weakness over the course of the next several days a
&gt; &gt; new one is in order.  Having that vent hole probably doesn't help matters
&gt; &gt; much and I am wondering if sealing it would effect these new maintenance
&gt; &gt; free gell cells?

&gt; Sealing the vent hole would prevent built up gases from escaping and probably would 
&gt; crack the case, allowing electrolyte to escape, essentially destroying the battery...

No, I meant the vent holes in the battery compartment. they vent to the
outside of the van thereby letting cold air in..... --
