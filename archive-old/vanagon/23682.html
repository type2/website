Subject: real long story of EV and Thing towing

Bus stuff and Thing stuff...  Cool...

Went to pick up my new Thing yesterday.  Used the new hitch on the 
Eurovan and a 'standard beetle' Tow bar from Mofoco.


'Bus' part:

Don't let anybody tell you an EV is underpowered.  The trip up was easy 
at speeds that a Police officer might not have approved of.  OKay I 
noticed some of the mountains - the EV isn't as quick up them as my 
Chrysler Conquest Hormone Special used to be.  Passed more than I was 
passed and even passed a truck or two up the nasty grades.

Towing with an EV is fine as far as I can tell.  Backing up sucked.  Okay 
it was virtually impossible.  Thing's problem though not the EV.  
Soemthing to do with the front wheels deciding on their own when to turn 
based on minute motions in the tow bar.  When backing I had my wife drive 
the EV while I kept the THings steering wheel from turning - chafed up 
the Things front tires though.  

Going forward was a breeze.  The EV and THing combination was a touch 
more squirrely on slight drifts but less than I've had towing normal 
trailers in other cars in the past.  Gas mileage honestly didn't seem to 
be any different.  Because of the A/T (I think) I've always been slightly 
disappointed to get less than 20 MPG and it was still in the 17 to 18 
with the Thing on the back.  Kept up speeds just fine (though I didn't 
drive the same 70+ kind of speeds staying down at 60+ (okay thats why the 
gas mileage was the same).  NO problem keeping up with traffic.  Towing 
with the EV is BETTER with the 2.5 5 than towing with the 2.6 6 in my 
S-10 Chevy pickup.  Accelerated better with the load and handling seemed 
smoother or something.

Had the three kids with me and my wife in the EV.  Used a 'cigarette 
lighter' powered cooler and both A/Cs running the whole time.  Love that 
VAN!!!


Thing part:

THis is that $300 dollar Thing that I got thanks to a post from Chris 
Chubb.  Again I thank him for his tip!  I see why it was only $300.  
Doesn't have the BN-4 heater.  Body is a bondo special.  Three of the 
windows are the ventless kind - only one of the vented kind.  All window 
plastic is foggy.  No telling what rust might be hiding unbder the spray 
can paint job and thick body putty.  But its shiny.  The PO had started 
to work on it as a 'project' with his than teenage son.  THey got so far 
along and than found another Thing in better condition and garaged this 
one.  Parts are detached and 'mostly' in the interior.  Has original 
1600DP (I think) and all the tin and seals still in place.  new brake 
parts and tires are decent.  Windshield and vinyl top are aftermarket 
replacements but fine.  Obviously it would run with major part of the 
transmission in the back seat.  Could pass Pennsylvania safety inspection 
but was running when the PO started to work on it.

Now the 'fun' part.  Had this standard Tow bar.  It has two U-shaped 
parts that slip over the axle and get held on with pins.  Problem was 
that the PPO before the PO had bought it did 'repairs'  which included 
the putty and spray can look.  Bad part was that I think the frnt axle 
beam was broken.  THe PPO welded in some heavy steel reinforcements.  
They were wider that the original vertical parts (Okay I don't actually 
know the terms).  big piece of 1/4 inch thick steel plate exactly where 
the pin for the tow bar was supposed to go.  Tools available were mostly 
the POs and mine where two states away.  Never expected to need a cutting 
torch to attach a tow bar - man there are some wierd tools in the day to 
day tool box for VWs.  THis guy had a hammer - standard 12 oz head I 
think, a not so big cold chisel,  and a hack saw.  Had jack stands, floor 
jeck and a pair of ramps.  Tried to work with out the jacks at all since 
he hadn't brought them out at first.  Uncomfortable position to try to 
reach this steel piece.  Decided to try cutting into the stell with the 
hacksaw and then bang out the resulting 'fingers' with the chisel. Nice 
notches cut were easy but really couldn't reach with the chisel.  Tried 
to raise my work.  tried the jackstand.  Anti-sway bar decides putting 
the axle on jack stand meant it was supposed to go right in the way of 
the peice I was working on (okay the piece was really on the back side of 
the axle - but the sway bars made access impossible).  I gave in to the 
sway bar.  Tried ramps.  Put them behind the front tires and pushed the 
Thing on up.  Heaven!  Could get up under the THing and bang away with 
the chisel.  Took enough of the plate out to slip the tow bar and its 
pins into place.  Oh I also had to bend some horizontal tabs on the tow 
bar down to slip over some thing on the two end of the axle.

After this the Thing just rolled right on behind the EV with out a care 
in the world.  Except when I pulled into the service station to put some 
air into the Things tires - didn't think 8 PSI was enough for some reason 
- I had to back up to leave.  This was not a pretty sight. The tow bar 
push the front tires into turning rather than trying to push the Thing 
back.  I had to hold the Things wheel straight while my wife backed the 
EV.  Things front tires got mad at me with any turning at all in 
reverse.  After this we decided ONLY to stop if the place we stopped had 
exit and entrance with out backing up.  Got some cool stares from other 
on the roads anyway.

Towing hint:

I made a 'light bar' out of a 'boat trailer light kit' and a piece of 
board.  Mounted the two lights on either end of the board and ran the 
wires though some holes I drilled in the center of the board.  The front 
end had two two strand wires running from the plug all the way to the two 
lights and a ground wire that ran only a couple feet.  The lights 
expected the mounting 'bolts' to provide ground - a piece of wood didn't 
do that.  I added a 'test clip' to the ground wire at the front and ran 
new a ground wire between the two lights and with the other strands away 
from the board for a couple feet.  Added a 'test clip' there as well.  
Used bungees to attach the board with the tail lights to the rear bumper 
of the Thing - clipped the wire to the tip of the exhaust as it was 
'bare' metal.  Ran the wires under the top into the back seat of the 
Thing and through a vent window up to the front of the car.  Scratched 
some paint off of the front license plate holder to reach bare metal with 
the front ground clip.  Plugged her into the connector from the EV.  
Worked great.
