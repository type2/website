Volks,
	For those of you considering going camping with us this weekend,
here are some directions:

&gt;From the North, make your way to highway 99 South.  About 50 miles South
of Fresno, turn East on 190 towards Porterville.  Continue on past
Porterville and up into the mountains.  This is where the road gets
annoying.  It is steep and windy for a long time (at least 20 miles?)
but once you get up into the mountains it smoothes out.  You will curve
gradually towards the South as you go around the Tule Indian
Reservation, and about 10 miles past Camp Nelson, you will find
Peppermint campground on the left side of the road.

&gt;From the South, take 5 North to highway 99 to Bakersfield, where you
will want to go East on 178.  Go around the lake on the West side, and
go North out of Kernville.  Eventually there will be a T in the road,
and you will want to go left (West).  You will cross the Kern River at
this point.  You will also pass through Johnsondale.  Soon after that,
take a right turn (heading North towards Camp Nelson).  Peppermint will
be on the right.  

I haven't checked to make sure Pepermint is open, but I will try and do
that tomorrow.  I don't foresee a problem, but it *is* in the mountains
so someone should check before we all drive up there.

-David
