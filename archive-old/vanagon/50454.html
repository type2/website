       Dan, REad YOur manual. At 75 MPH they are designed to fold
            back, for high speed driving=21 Wait to see what happens
            at 100 MPH=21
                             Sorry I thought it was Friday
                                      Eric Zeno

Nothing happened at 100 MPH, I tested it personally two years ago on
downhill with a hard windstorm in the back.

Still alive, Helmut
'80 Camper

(Can't wait until Friday)
