Subject: Re: Darn! No Neon For Yer Van! (F)

     We've been playing with the idea of neons over here for our buses.
     
     What cooler sight than turning up to a weekend event on the Friday 
     night with your California plates, UV underfloor neons and a Chrome 
     stinger - I'm sure you'd pull loads of chicks, well err, maybe.
     
     I wonder what the law would have to say about them though:
     
     &quot;Sorry lads you can't have them lights on you know&quot;
     
     &quot;really officer they're just for when the bus breaks down so
      I can see what to repair&quot;
     
     &quot;Well you still can't have them but it's OK to have them very
      small rear lights that could reults in a large pile up when 
      you brake!&quot;
     
     &quot;yeah right&quot;
     
     Lee.
