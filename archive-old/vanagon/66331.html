Subject:      FS '81 vanagon 2.0L air-cooled

   I have what is probably the nicest air-cooled, non show car, vanagon in
town. It is for sale, make an offer. I am looking for a beetle,67-69. My wife
, unfortunately for her, bought a non vw van, and now we dont need two vans
and mine must go. I will trade it for similiar condition bug, preferrably
those years mentioned above but will accept any year as long as it is not a
super beetle.My vanagon has new cylinders and new pistons and new heads. It
runs Ok but needs to be fine tuned. Rare a/c unit is installed, needs to be
hooked back up. Please E-mail me if interested or know anyone who is.
