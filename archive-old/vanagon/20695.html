Subject: carburator for a '73 bus

Hi all,

My '73 bus is having problems with the current carburator setup. I
bought the bus with an &quot;after market&quot; (as the mechanic calls it)
carburator, different from the original double side setup. Right now,
the bus is having serious carburation problems, it stalls, and dies at
low revs. I was thinking in getting the original setup and try
rebuilding it, but the mechanic suggested me that a Dual Dellorto
single barrel kit might work better...

Any suggestions on this? Has anyone had any experience with this
Dellorto setup? Will I be better off going with an original rebuilt
setup? Any help would be appreciated, i recently acquired the
bus and i'm kind of going in the blind with this since i don't have
much experience.

Thanks in advance!
