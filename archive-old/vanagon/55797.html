Subject: ANNOUNCE: Best of Type2 Archive


I have uploaded the &quot;Best of Type2&quot; conglomeration to the web page. &quot;Best&quot;
in my opinion only, but WTF...

http://www.type2_dot_com/best_of/index.html

This is a searchable archive of selected threads posted to the list in the
past. The threads were selected for their high-quality content; they were
gleaned from sifting about 350 digests. None of these messages appear in
the official searchable list archive because they were all originally
posted to the Primenet list. I'm going to have it function as a list FAQ,
because most all of the frequent bus questions are answered there in depth.

It can be searched either by subject line or by full text. It returns full
threads, not single messages.

Total volume is somewhere around 2.5 megs, which makes it big enough to be
complete but small enough that it can be searched quickly. I'll be adding
to it as I go through more digests and start foraging into the v_at_l archive.

I know the interface is pretty hideous, still have to work on that. Maybe
someday we'll have a home page that doesn't look like somebody drew it with
a crayon, too. But it does work. ;)
