Subject: 85 Vanagon Feedback

Hi all,

Does anybody knows if this year was a problematic one? I have a 85 Vanagon
 and I see too many negative messages about this year. In fact I have an
intermittent rough running in my wasserboxer. I changed the ignition cables
the ignition cap, the rotor and the coolant sensor and still once in a
while the van runs roughly and in other moments it runs fine. Is this a bad
O2 sensor or flow meter? The injectors work perfect and the electrical     
signal goes straight to the ignition. What is happening?!? Any help would be
appreciated. Thanks to all.
