Subject: Re: front to rearcoolant pipes-starting to rust more than a bit!

hasnt happened to me yet- i look at these a lot and wonder what the 
damage$ will be to do these.

Did you think of plumbing it in with 1&quot; PVC - $20 or less for both pipes
 more time on your part but i think it would end up a lot cheaper...
