&gt;Whew!  A most thorough defense, Steve. ;-)
&gt;
&gt;My .02 (we must have about $10.00 by now) is to use the Holy Trilogy:  
&gt;Haynes, for detail and experience (&quot;Each manual is based on a compleat 
&gt;breakdown, blah, blah...); Bentley, for the tight%ss method (&quot;using VW tool 
&gt;#3458394 and shaving all body hair before beginning work&quot;), etc.; and 
&gt;Muir, for the how-to-do-it portion, rather how the Compleat Idiot would 
&gt;do it.  I, too, was more-or-less an 
&gt;automotive ignurt before I bought my first car (a VW, of course).  
&gt;
&gt;JKH--Alburquerque
&gt;'70 Kombi (on it's way back--today=new ignition switch)

Excellent description of the Bentley manual!  I wish Haynes had one for the
diesel Vanagon.  Did Muir ever go into the VW diesels?

BTW  I used to have a '67 van.
