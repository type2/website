Subject: '80 Vanagon Owners Manual

Well, got my new '81 Vanagon Owners Manual from VW today.  Very nice 
(NOS) and only $15 delivered.  I also have a '60-'64 Bus Owners Manual 
coming from them soon.  The manual that was in the '81 was for an '80 
model and had been wet at some time (mildew stains).  It will go free to 
whoever on the list asks for it first.
