Subject: external cooler/filter : trust the dipstick?

Hello again all-

I was helping a friend with his bus the other day, and I got to
thinking about something:  He has an external cooler and a filter, of
the &quot;replace-the-stock-cooler&quot; variety, and he has it all mounted in
the engine compartment.  I know he's preheating his cylinder-cooling
air that way, but that's not my question this time.  What I'm
wondering is:

With all that hose and cooler and filter up above the case, it seems
to me that perhaps you can't trust the dipstick any more.  Would the
extra oil from the cooler/filter/hoses drain back down into the case
and make it appear over-filled when it's really OK?

Hmmm,

-Mitch
