Thanks Dave. I was guessing on some stuff, including the head prices. I 
appreciate the correction. 8) Joe

&gt; I don't think so.  Your 77 has a 2-liter engine which uses 94mm p[istons
&gt; and liners.  The cheapest I could find them was $299/set.  And, the
&gt; prices were purported to be going up.  Those pistons and liners in the
&gt; JC WhipMe catalog are for type I (i.e. beetle) engines.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; with a smile; no hassles. I believe you can buy *new* heads for around 
&gt; &gt; $150 each, though new heads may give you no better service than good 
&gt; &gt; condition heads with new or good valves.
&gt; 
&gt; I bought rebuilts at GEX for $129 each.  The 2-liter heads are more, I
&gt; think $179 each.  If I could have found new heads for $150, I would have
&gt; been all over them, but I didn't know they were avaliable.  I'd be
&gt; interested to know where they were being sold.  I will NOT buy anything
&gt; from GEX again - their quality is very poor in my experience.
&gt; 
&gt; If you don't hear any expensive noises, and you know the history of this
&gt; bus, change the oil and leave the bottom end alone, unless you have $800
&gt; to spend on it.  At least that's my advice.
