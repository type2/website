  Strange, I've just been through this procedure myself. I used JB Weld
 type stuff to repair a stripped stud hole in a set of motorcycle 
 crankcases. Its seems to have done a reasonable job, but I haven't
 torqued the stud up to the full amount yet. I left it about three days
 before trying to do anything with it.

 I've also mended a small (external) crack in a cylinder head in the same
 way. Although both repairs were ok, I'd still rather have had the 
 time/money/ability to have the jobs welded &amp; re-tapped properly.
