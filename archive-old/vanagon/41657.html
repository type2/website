Hey, Peoples...

One of the first groovy experiences in Edward('81 Westy), who we've had for just 
over a week now, happened today.....after me going to the dentist and the DMV 
(to register Edward) and Michele playing with dirt and plants all day, we had 
dinner after an oil change.(Y'know how much of a pain it is to have to level 
your car because your driveway's slanted...to change your oil?)  Anyway, we 
decided to leap up and go view the Pacific at the mouth of the Russian River in 
all its splendour, and to feel out the new oil....sitting there overlooking the 
ocean, with the seals, gulls, and beautiful water making trippy patterns where 
the river and surf meet...wait..what's that?   A strange dark shape in the 
waters just beyond the mouth...too large to be a seal...hope it's not human, for 
they could be in trouble!  Ooh a whale!  Verrry close to shore...as we watched, 
many aquatic mammals of large proportion surfaced, squirted, waved their 
flippers about, and even stuck their noses in the air....and there we were, safe 
from the chill Pacific winds, but with enviable views of it all, comfortable as 
hell to boot...in our new, and most beloved(although still that pukey &quot;ivory&quot;) 
1981 Volkswagen Westfalia named Edward....it has only just begun!
