Subject: RE: '87 Radio Power Source

The diagram says gray w/ black, it could look blue. The wire is the only
gray wire coming from the ignition switch plug.  I removed the lower half
of the steering column cover and just pressed the plug release tabs and
pulled the plug  loose to work on it.  Note the gray w. blk will only test
w/ power if the plug is connect to the switch, and the key is in. I'll post
this to the group, cause it seems to work well for me.  Also note my
vanagon's yr is 91, you're diagram may list a different color scheme. If
you &quot;probe&quot;, ie stick the  metal point of your test light or multimeter
postive lead into the gray wire your should be able to verify the circuit.

&gt;&gt;I used the grayw/b lead from the ignition switch, it is activated when the
&gt;&gt;key is inserted into the lock. The power on my stays on when the key is in
&gt;&gt;the run and start position.  My wiring diagram, Library edition, confirms
&gt;&gt;that the &quot;switch&quot; is close.  So my rad is off when key is out, else it has
&gt;&gt;power. I posted this a couple of days ago, but I didn't see the userlist
&gt;&gt;copy come back to me.

BTW I'M moving back to the Seattle area, Des Moines or Renton, soon,
&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;Hey Now!
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm am installing a CD player in my '87 GL.  I'm wondering about a
&gt;&gt;&gt;switched power source for the radio.  The ones I've found are only &quot;hot&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;when the key is in the &quot;ignition on&quot; position and I can hear the fuel
&gt;&gt;&gt;running.  Is there a source that is &quot;hot&quot; when the key is in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;position just before the &quot;ignition on&quot; position so that the CD will play
&gt;&gt;&gt;without having the fuel pump run?  I found one source that was &quot;hot&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;when you inserted the key in the ignition, but it didn't carry a current
&gt;&gt;&gt;in the &quot;ignition on&quot; poistion.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;TIA
&gt;&gt;&gt;
