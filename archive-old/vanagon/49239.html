 I'm getting ready to make an offer on a 1980 Vanagan Westy, 125K but 
 only 5K on new (remanufactured) engine, no body rust, OK interior, stove 
 &amp; frige work, no AC.  
 
 What do you think this one would be worth on the East Coast?
 
 He wants $5900, which I think is high.
 
 If you could reply today, even with just a WAG as to a reasonable price, 
 it would be GREAT as I want to buy a vehicle very Badly this weekend!
  &gt;&gt;
For that kind of money, i would wait and find one with a radiator.  Maybe
even power steering.
