Subject: Water in gas tank

I have had some problems with my Vanagon choking up when I step on the gas, 
almost like it was running out of gas.  The electric fuel pump has been a 
little noisy the past few weeks, so I decided to check it out.  I ran the 
flow rate test described in Bentley where you disconnect the fuel return
line from the pressure regulator, jumper the fuel pump relay, and measure
how much pumps in 30 sec.

Problem is, the stuff that came out was milky looking. I assume my gas
somehow has gotten water in it.  The problems seem have occurred since my 
last fill up and I am now on the bottom quarter of the tank.

Any comments regarding what I should do to drain the tank and whether or 
not any damage has been done?  Besides changing the filter, is there
anything else I should do to try to purge the system or clean it out once
I drain the tank?
