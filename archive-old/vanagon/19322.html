This is almost too weird, after a weekend of dealing with my 
temper-ature-mental 1900, I've decided that the best bet would probably 
for me to pick up one of those as well and I had logged in tonight with 
the express purpose of asking your esteemed collective expert opinion.  
This is probably one of the wordiest &quot;me-too's&quot; that I've ever seen. :)
