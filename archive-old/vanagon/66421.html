Subject:      parts from '87 vanagon

I currently have for sale various parts from my '87 vanagon. Prices do not include shipping which I ask that the buyer pay. ECU - $300.00, instrument cluster - $100.00, power steering rack - $80.00, non-power steering rack - $80.00, various other pieces will be available as I can get them together. This van was fully functioning until it threw a rod. If you need a part, e-mail me at bbellm_at_neca_dot_com. All interior pieces are brown as is the exterior. thanks.
