I could be wrong but for the last couple of years these seemed
unavailable, so I'm calling Tire Rack, as it's time to finally
make a decision on the '78 (I'm leaning toward Michelin 195/75R14
LTX M+S, a real nice moderately aggresive tread) and the guy mentions
that their current price leader is again the reinforced Continetal.
Now don't hold me to it but I think he said $49 EACH!!!  But maybe
he did say $59, anyway better than the reinforced XZX at $67, or the
old budget leader the Yoko Y356 which was about $60 (admittedly in
8 ply but I don't like the tread design).  Of course these darn 7.00 x
14 bias ply C rated Kelleys are still calling me to Sams for $44 each,
with an evil mudslinging tread design and lots of tread.  Measured them
to be about 26&quot; unmounted in diameter which seems to make them perfect.
Oh the decision the decisions.
