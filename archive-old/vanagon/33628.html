I am the proud owner of an owners manual-less 1982 VW VanagonL Westphalia and
am trying to get an owners manual for both the Vanagon and the Westphalia
conversion.   A question...when I see an advert. for owners manuals for the
Camper (VOM CA-xxx Camper),  is this the Westphalia conversion that I have?

Thanks for any help....Vince Outlaw (vincent.g.outlaw_at_cpmx.saic_dot_com)
