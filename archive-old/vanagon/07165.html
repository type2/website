Subject: Disk Crash!

The vanagon archives will be unavailable for an indefinite period.  The disk
drive which contained the files has decided that mondays are just too hard,
so it crashed.  It's possible that any files that were added to the archives
since the beginning of the month will need to be recreated.  Note that this
does NOT involve archives of the list messages nor operation of the list,
which rely on a different disk. 

Thanks for your patience, and I will notify you when we're back up.
