Subject: Return of Westfalia

To get rid of dog or cat &quot;accident&quot; odors, go to a pet supply store and 
get a product called &quot;Dog-Tex&quot;.  Get it in the concentrated form (about 
$5-6 per bottle).  It will make several gallons of liquid that will
bio-degrade the urine to an odorless substance.  Don't know if that 
is correct or not but it does work however it's done.  It works much
better than grits IMHO.
