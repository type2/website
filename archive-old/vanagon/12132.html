Al and Derek gave options of spare fuel tanks.

I just had this image of driving in the booneys with the
fuel cells on top and two tanks below.  what is that
about 45 gallons or so of fuel.  Slosh-Slosh! BOOM!!!  :O

Anyway, Al, how many gallons in these fuel cells and
would it go on a fiberglass pop-top?
