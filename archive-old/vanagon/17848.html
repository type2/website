Subject: Re: Awning/tent for Eurovan

John,
 I just bought a 95 Eurovan camper and the awning from the dealer. It is
pretty neat little contraption. I cost $377. It is a very generic awning
for any eurovan and probably vanagan. It took drilling 6 holes about the
size of my index finger into the top of the body(ouch!) for the anchors
but the rest was just slipping  the awning into the anchors. It doesn't
have the tent like feature but I have had ideas to attach misquito netting
around the outside edges to make it tentlike. sofar I haven't found any good
netting but I figure it should only cost about another 80-100 dollars to buy
the netting and some zippers.

&gt; I'm looking for an awning with a side tent/room for a Eurovan.
&gt;
&gt; I figure it may come in handy on those rainy days.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone know of any suppliers?
