Subject: FS: 64 X 83 P/C set

For you early split window types restoring an early engine, I have a set of
big-bore (83mm), 64mm stroke pistons &amp; cylinders that are new.  I was trying
to get $60 for them at the show.  I'll ship them for $40 COD if anyones
interested.  I guess I should measure the outside diameter to see if they
need the case holes opened, I think they do.

Eug,
