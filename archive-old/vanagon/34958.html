Subject: Point Lube &amp; Grease

I think there may be a little confusion about this dielectric grease 
/ point lube stuff (maybe on my part).  I think we're talking about 
two entirely different things.  I THINK dielectric grease is 
conductive goop that you put on high voltage electrical connections 
to maintain current flow and prevent corrosion.  Point lube is 
silicon lube that goes between the rider on the movable point 
and the distributor shaft  to prevent excessive wear.  If I'm wrong, 
feel free to correct me.  I'm think though that point lube won't do 
you much good on your  plug wires, and I wouldn't put dilectric 
grease inside my distributor.  Again, I could be wrong, but I'm 
pretty sure that's what my dilectric grease (permatex) tube says.  
I've always used regular high temp. lube on my distributor shaft, so 
I'm just speculating at the properties of the platinum-laced (must be at $6
a pop) point lube.

Quien sabe?
