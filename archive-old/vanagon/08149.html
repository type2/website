Subject: Engine transplant operation

CHECK YOUR OIL LEVEL EVERY TIME YOU BUY FUEL!!!
(boy, do I feel like an idiot)

Last year I drove the '73 bus without enough oil in the crankcase.
&lt;strike one&gt;
Oct '94 the heater ducting from the electric fan to the heater box on
the rt side fell off and got wrapped up in the fan.
&lt;strike two&gt;
Nov '94 a mysterious rattle could not be tracked down and elimated.
It's not coming from anywhere on the *outside* of the motor.
I examined the oil strainer screen and found big chunks of metal.
&lt;strike three. yer out!&gt;
The 1.7 liter with dual carbs and 105K miles finally bit the dust.

  I found a guy that had a crashed '78 bus with a good 2.0 liter
to use as an engine donor for a transplant operation. It's got
a couple minor problems like an exhaust leak caused by a rusted
through EGR filter and a dented muffler. It has about 20K miles on it
and a new alternator. I paid $650 for all the engine related parts off
the donor vehicle.
The donor '78 has the front sheet metal on the passenger side crushed
all the way back to the seat.  Thank goodness the driver is ok and
not a donor himself. (He was driving alone during the accident.)

  My tools and knowledge are inadequate for this type of engine 
swap so I'm having a mechanic handle the work. He does fabrication
MIG/TIG welding and off-road race prep type work. He says that I'll
need the following parts off the '78 donor:
1. Air box, metal braket and associated injection parts (F.I. &quot;Brain&quot;)
2. Fuel tank and fuel pump.
3. Exhaust system.
4. Transmission support brace.
5. etc.
Anyone else out there done this before?  Any hints/suggestions?

Why don't I just rebuild the old 1.7 motor???   Good question.
  The old 1.7 had no Calif smog equipment on it. (flame me directly)
  The 1.7 liter engine was only installed in a couple model year
vehicles ('73 and '74 I think.) so there's limited numbers of 1.7 
parts out there in circulation.
  More horsepower in the 2.0 (according to Bentley)

'73 Westy (sans motor)
Cats: Orlon and Sparks

p.s. The rest of the '78 Westy is up for sale as parts.
I almost went for the seats and tires/rims, but I'm feelin poor.
