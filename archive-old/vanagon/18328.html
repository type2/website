jg &amp;erik,

Are any modifications of the sending units necessary for the Audi 4000
gauges? What did you use etc. Also a repeat of a question that was covered a
couple of weeks ago:
The oil temp and pressure gauges (analog) as advertised in the magazines
have different temp/pressure ratings. What temp/pressure ratings are
recommended for a 1776 044 Type I engine to be installed in a splittie bus?

.........................................................................

&gt;What I have done with my Vanagon is use the trio-gauge-cluster from
&gt;an Audi 4K.  It fits perfectly where the radio is/wuz,  finding a place
&gt;for the homeless radio is yet another story...
