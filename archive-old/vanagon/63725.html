Make sure this t-stat is an exact replacement.  Especially the small bypass 
disc on the bottom.  I've seen these slightly oversized causing them to get 
stuck in the housing.  By the way, if you are heating in traffic, a lower temp 
t-stat will do nothing for you.  The problem is lack of air flow.  I carry low 
temp fan switches that will turn the fan on earlier which is what you need.  
80C (172F), is a little on the cool side.  Especially for winter use.  I would 
stick with the stock stat.

   My 1986 syncro runs hot only around town. On the highway it will
   finally cool where the gauge goes below the LED. After fixing or 
   replacing almost everything, I went to find a cooler thermostat.
   At the new Pep Boys Auto parts store in my area, I found a 
   Thermostat being marketed by Robetshaw. It's part number is
   910-180. It opens at 80 deg C. The original runs at 87 Deg C.
   It was only $12.
