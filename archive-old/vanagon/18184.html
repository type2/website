&gt; ACK!

I agree!  I like VANAGON the way it is.  I don't have one; I have a '71.
BUTT, I think the people on the list are way cool and we have a great	
forum.  VintagVW list is just tooo much fer me.  I have to get off that  	
stuff, but I'm addicted.  Anyway, VANAGON is the list for me.  I loved
that huge flame war around the guy with the Chrysler!  He deserved it!
