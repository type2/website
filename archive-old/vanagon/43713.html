Subject: Re: RE: Generator access or engine acces

On my 71 (now rusted away in the woods), I jacked up the rear and used
stands- then removed engine mount bar from frame while engine weight was
held by two scissors jacks standing on board resting on three broom handle
pieces.  The  board had two holes drilled in it with rope attached.  Then
you let down the engine until it is horizontal, with trans resting on
cinder block.   Now it is easy to get to the top rear engine bolts, and
just pull out the engine on the rollers.  Easy with rear deck crosspiece
removed- tougher on my 78 with the *&amp;%$_at_#! crosspiece welded in!  This is
also a good way to get clearance above the engine without actually pulling
it...could do it all myself this way- putting engine in was easy with board
and rollers- you should have seen me operate two scissors jack handles at
once! Push engine to roll back in, use sledge on board edges to align
engine to trans shaft and mount holes.  That damn rear crossbar on 78 made
it tough to align engine at same angle of trans when mating again....MB
