I don't know what the BEST carbs would be, but I have been extremely happy
with the Dellortos I installed on my `74 bus.  Although they're not a perfect
match for the VW 1800 engine they still work so much better than the stock
Solexes did (power, smooth acceleration) that I don't care.  By not being a
perfect match I mean that the engine can't handle the full volume of fuel/air
that the carbs can deliver; the last 1/4 or so of the gas pedal is superfluous
and, in fact, detrimental (it bogs at higher altitudes... too much gas).

I have dual 36mm Dells... not the Baby Dells but the full-sized ones.  With
the dual-port heads and the intake risers that come with them it amounts to
an individual carb per cylinder.  Gas mileage isn't great at 17MPG, and I
suspect that smogging the bus would be difficult, depending on the laws, but
for that I get far more power and easier cruising at freeway speeds. Also, the
Dellortos are basically foolproof to install and maintenance-free once you 
get them jetted and synched.  I've had mine for over 30K miles now.

Just one opinion in a sea of them...
