Subject: why so slow?
Date: Mon, 3 Apr 1995 22:25:42 -0400 (EDT)

please don't kill me...

as a healthy, red blooded, hormonally laden twenty year-old i had to try
and max out my bus the other day.  got to an indicated speed of
ninety-five {yeah- 95} mph before i decided that i really didn't want to
pay for _another_ rebuild [and those trees didn't look too inviting
anyway].  i know, i know, why drive any car that fast, let alone a
bredloaf...sometimes one has to be stupid (i normally drive 60-64). so
here's the question...why is everybody else to pleased to be going seventy??
i had a bunch of pedal left....
(100mph?  not for me thanks!)
