Subject: RE: Gear ratio choices


Some VWs have had other engines put into them, like Ford V6's or whatever.
For these engines, the original VW gearing lets the engine turn around
3500 RPM at 65 mph, depending on the year, tire size, etc. That's fine
for the original VW engine, but sort of high for the &quot;foreign&quot; (hee hee)
engine.

Is it possible to replace parts in the VW transaxle, to lower all gear
ratios by the same proportion? For old Detroit iron, this was fairly easy,
since those cars had front engines and rear differentials: just replace
the gears inside the differential housing in the rear axle. Or, replace
the entire rear axle with one from another car, that had the different
gears already inside.

But, do VW transaxles even HAVE the equivalent of a rear differential?
It would be inside the transaxle with all the other gears, of course
(is it becoming obvious that I know zero, zip, nada about VW transaxles?).
Can the gear ratios of all four forward gears, be changed by changing
one or two gears in this final drive? Any VW tranny experts out there?
Where would one get parts for this? Specifically, for, say, an '81 Vanagon.

Changing tire size would have the same effect. But there is a very
limited range where you can do this-- I replaced the stock 195/75R14s on
my '71 bus, with 215/75R14s, for less than a 5% difference in final drive
ratio if you work the numbers. Can't go any bigger, 'cuz now I hear an
occasional zzzzip when I go over a driveway bump with the wheels fully
turned. Also, there are no larger diameter tires for 14&quot; rims-- I'd
have to get new 15&quot; or 16&quot; wheels, which would be rare and expensive,
and they still wouldn't help clearance.

BTW, the bus tracks like it's on rails with those tires. Love 'em!

Any knowledgeble tranny people like to take a stab at this?

Thanx in advance...
