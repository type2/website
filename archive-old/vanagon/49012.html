&gt; Steven,
&gt; 
&gt; You said:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Make that ~ $600 which includes customs duties and everything you 
&gt; &gt;     need to hook it up excluding the propane feed pipe.
&gt; 
&gt; Oops, mees never paid the $100 customs duty, nobody ever asked.._dot_dearie
&gt; me!  BTW.  The propane feed pipe (plus everthing else) cost less than
&gt; the hot water bottles by most westie campers (that is, in colder
&gt; climates than CA anyway).

The customs duties was $20, but with the exchange rate, the total for
everything including the $38 shipping cost was about $590.  Youch!  :(

But I'll be toasty warm on some chilly nights.  :)
