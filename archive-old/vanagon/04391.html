&gt; &gt; the sep/oct 94 issue of vw autoist says:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Eurovan: VW is recalling 8,350 1993 Eurovans equipped with impact
&gt; &gt; collapsible steering wheel. The steering column assembly includes a
&gt; &gt; universal joint that is attached to the steering shaft and secured by
&gt; &gt; locking bolts.  The upper locking bolt was not sufficiently torqued
&gt; &gt; during manufacture and can eventually loosen.  A loosened bolt could
&gt; &gt; render the steering system inoperative and cause an accident.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Has anybody heard from Ric this afternoon?  I saw him leave for lunch 
&gt; a couple of hours ago, something about running some errands...
&gt; 

Yeh...He was mumbling something about &quot;fuc---g G.D. Steer Wheel..Always comn'
off!&quot; or something like that....   ;P
