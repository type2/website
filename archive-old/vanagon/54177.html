I agree with Kenyon on this one.  I have never seen Vanagon Westfalia for
sale around here (Boulder, CO) for less than $5000, no matter the year or
mileage.  OK mabye without an engine...mabye.  Most Westfalias are between
$7000 and $20,000.  Of course they seem exceptionally high priced
around here.  I estimate that my '86 Westfalia with a new rebuilt
engine to be worth around $12,000.  
There was recently a '91 Syncro Westfalia for $29,000, jeez, how much were
they new?!  Not that I wouldn't buy it if I had $29,000 to spend:)

&gt; With regards your posting, number
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;4/Used '90 or '91 Vanagon Westy around US$10k&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; I have spent the last two months looking for a '91 Westy and have not found
&gt; anything decent for US$10k
&gt; 
&gt; I have found 2 Westies in the $22K range with low miles, well maintained.
&gt; The first had 29,000 miles and sold before I could make an offer at $22,000.
&gt; The second was listed at $22,500 and I am second in line to get it with 36,000
&gt; miles. If you know where I can ger a '91 Westy with low miles in excellent
&gt; condition for $10K I would love to hear from you. I have found '89s and '87s
&gt; for $18,500 and better with 80,000 miles, rebuilt engines etc.
&gt; 
&gt; What kind of condition and how many miles would you '91 have at $10K?
