Subject: August campout


I'm a little behind on posting results of my trying to organize
the August 25-27th campout, and I'll try to do something more in-depth
soon, but just wanted to let you all know it's definitely happening.

With the amount of vehicles we are expecting, we will fit into
the campground that has been recommended to us on BLM land at
Kings Canyon, just west of Garberville.  I'll post directions
to it soon.  The name of the campground is Wailaki (pronounced
why-locki), and is at the southern end of this reserve.

The place is pretty primitive - they have I think some pit
toilets, but is not the type of place with hook-ups, ac, etc., so
truck it in!  Also, I&quot;m not sure that civilization is going to
be all that accessible with the type of roads we may have to go
in on, so check to make sure your car is in order, tires good,
bring gas, bring lots of water, food, propane, whatever you need, etc.

Here's a list of who's coming:
