&lt;&lt; &gt; What does a black sooty tail pipe mean and what do i do about it?
 &gt; (is it running too rich and do i need to lean the mixture?  How?)

 Yes, a black, sooty tail pipe usually indicates a too-rich mixture, so
 you need to lean the mixture. &gt;&gt;

EVERY car I've ever seen has a black sooty tailpipe..
i dont think this is a reason for concern....
