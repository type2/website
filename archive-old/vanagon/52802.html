I picked this up from another list and I thought some of you might be
interested.  The book could lead to sources for some unique equipment.

Dear All,

I recently purchased a book called 'Travel Vans' by John Speed as I am in the
process of preparing an expedition vehicle for a trip around the world next
year.  I have found it to be an excellent and well written publication which
has certainly taught me an awful lot about all aspects of motor caravan
construction.

It covers the following topics and more:-  Electrics, Plumbing, Gas;Choosing
and Using a 'Van; Sites and Wild Camping; Driving and Parking; Getting Stuck
and Unstuck;  Draining and Flushing for Winter; Construction Techniques;
 Layouts; Specialist Parts Suppliers; Insulation;  Condensation;  Windows and
Vents; Cookers; Lighting; Roof Fixings; Spotlights; Water Systems and
Filters; Accumulator Tanks; Frost Protection; Water Heaters; 12 Volts
Connections; Selecting a Battery; Battery Charging; Solar Panels; Generators;
Wind Generators; Mains Hook-Ups; RCDs and RCBOs; Inverters; Microwave Ovens;
Cable Sizes; Gas, Cylinders, and Safety; Propane and / or Butane; Heaters;
Refrigerators; Security and Alarms; DogsPetrol and Diesel; Extra Fuel Tanks;
Expedition Vehicles; Radios and TVs; Satellite 'Van Systems; Hi-Fi in the
'Van; Things To Take; Ferries; Borders; Conversion Tables.

I guess the book is somewhat biased toward the UK and Europe as all of the
'useful contacts' are in that neck of the woods. Those living further afield
would still find it very useful.  This is not an advert and I have nothing to
do with the publishers - I just think it's a great book and is a 'must' for
anyone preparing an expedition vehicle,R.V. or motor caravan.

If you are interested, contact John Speed at   geoprisa_at_andorra.ad       
or Stuart Allsop at      SAllsop559_at_aol_dot_com

Regards,  Dave.
