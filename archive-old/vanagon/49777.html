Subject: ouch!! '83.5 bumper needed 8-(

On may way to the Cincinnati VW Clubs' Bugfest '96 yesterday, I was 
rearended! To make matters worse, the guy has no insurance!

So, I am in need of a chrome bumper with the rubber trim strip for my 
'83.5 w/c. Believe it or not, the new end caps I bought from Bus Boys 
came through without a scratch or crack. No visual damage to the 
exhuast or engine, going to take a much closer look tonight. I'm hoping 
the metal 'lip' between the bumper and the engine can be bent back 
somewhat. 

Anybody have one they want to part with? I'm going to post to all the 
vw classifieds. Anybody had to buy a new one? Advice?
