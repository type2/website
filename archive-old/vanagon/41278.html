Subject:       '57 Taxed to Death! [F]

It's time to register the Pioneer!  (Yes, we've been together for a 
year already)

I open the Motor Vechile Registration packet and look at my tax.

$14.50 registration fee
$198.88 property tax

$213.38 TOTAL

After I was revived by CPR, I looked over the form.  The Tax 
assesment value on my bus was $11640.00!!!

I only wish it was worth that.  So anyway I called up the motor 
vehicle division:

&quot;Umm, I think the tax estimate is wrong on my car.&quot;

&quot;Well, sir, the value on the form is not the market 
value, it is a _depreciated_ value.&quot;

&quot;No, I think the estimated value is way too high.&quot;

&quot;Oh... What's your plate number?&quot;

...

&quot;Now what year is your car?&quot;

&quot;57.&quot;

&quot;It is a DELIVERY VEHICLE?&quot;

&quot;NO!, it is a little volkswagen bus.&quot;

&quot;A school bus?&quot;

&quot;NO! A Volkswagen bus.&quot;

&quot;Oh.  You mean one of those little Volkswagen Vans?&quot;

&quot;YES! One of those little vans.&quot;

&quot;Well those aren't very big are they?&quot;

&quot;No it's not big.  Definately not a commercial delevery van!&quot;

&quot;Ok, one sec.&quot;

&lt;Obligatory 10 minute government pause&gt;

&quot;Ok, your tax will be $9.50&quot;

&lt;SIGH OF RELIEF&gt;

&quot;Good!  Thank you very much!&quot;


And so that's my Little Tax Story for the day...
