As long as everybody else is doing it...

My name is Jim.  I am the curator of the slide collection for the 
department of architecture at the university of nebraska lincoln.  
This in not nearly as impressive as it sounds.  It does pay the bills.
I am also a highly skilled bicycle mechanic. :)  I still do it on 
weekends.  I live with a woman named Heather.  We have verbal 
agreement to stick together through it all.  Some would call it 
married but I prefer to keep the state out of my personal affairs as 
much as possible.  I am a vegan, I brew my own beer.  I own a '71 
campmobile.  Or does it own me?  Previous to owning said bus I was 
autoless for nearly 7 years.  That's a lot of very cold bike rides.  I
still ride the bike, even when the bus does run.  I am going to live 
forever.  In case you haven't guessed it by now I am also a bit 
insane.  Some days you are the only group of people in the world who 
will listen to me.  This is one very strange and beautiful thing.  I 
thank you all.  If you are ever near Lincoln, we are right on 
interstate 80, pick up the phone book and call.  Notice the Jr, don't 
call my dad, he has enough to worry about with a son like me.

Yrs, Jim
