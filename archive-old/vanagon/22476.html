Subject: RE: Whatever happened to... (was: Vanagon Power?)



&gt;Here in Minnesota, I'd shutter (literally) at the thought of going a winter 

&gt;without a VERY warm vehicle.  I see folks in busses, bugs, on bicycles too. 

&gt; Something about the Wasserboxer warm (or the potential for it) that 
enticed
&gt;me to these models.


Bought my first bug in Minnesota-- consult archives RE thread
on VW drivers with one arm longer than other from scraping
glass as they drive.

First bus was in Dillon, CO, at 9,000 feet. It was a '69 step-thru,
bought in 1983. The two things I liked most about it were:

1.) The way it cruised up I-70 on glare ice (7% grade), whizzing
past the 4x4s who had stopped (in the middle of the freeway,
sometimes) to put on chains.

2.) The GREAT heater it had! Original heater boxes, I'm pretty sure.
I would start from Boulder when it was like 10 below Farenheit at
night. By the time I was 10 minutes out of town, the whole bus
was warm enough that I could take off my goosedown jacket and drive
comfortably in shirtsleeves. Fact!

Of course, for short trips (&lt;5 min), it would barely start warming,
by the time you got there. And eventually, the heater started producing
a strong exhaust smell. Replaced both boxes with cheapie aftermarket
ones, and suddenly the heater was wimpy-- only seemed to work on
warm, sunny days. I've since learned (from this list!) that some
replacements are little more than J-tubes with shrouds, and that
the good ones with internal fins must be sought out.
