Subject: timing at 3,000 rpm


As always and per spec, I set the timing at 5 atdc at idle. Unfortunately,
this causes advance to be about 42 btdc at 3,000 rpm, a bit much it seems. 
For the quick and cheap fix, should I readjust timing to 28 btdc at 3,000
rpm or leave as is?  For the more costly (time and money) fix, do I need a
new distributor? For the overkill fix: can I replace the distributor with 
one of those elctronic boxes they advertize in HotVWs?

I did check Bentley, but got a bit confused: a table shows the
*centrifugal* timing range for my 022 905 205 AB distributor (2,000 rpm,
11-17 deg. -- 3,600, 21-25 deg.), but doesn't say whether the vacuum hoses
to the vacuum chamber unit should be disconnected or not. Anyone know?

Thanks!

Sami
