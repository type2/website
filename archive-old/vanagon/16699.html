John: slightly off topic- but I noticed that you have heated washer
nozzles.  I enquired about setting  up something like this on
rec.autos.tech. Some of the answers coming  back included: a) heat would
have no effect; b) heat will crack the glass; c) fluid should not be heated
etc. What were your experiences? My idea was to wrap some of the tubing
around the heater matrix hose as a &quot;pre-heater&quot;. Is this
what VW does? Could it be retrofitted to wasserboxers? DC
