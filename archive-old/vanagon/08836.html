Wait just so I am clear on this the flywheel is bolted to the engine side
of things and you have kept your engine but dropped the transmission,
right? Normally to do a clutch the engine is dropped but the transmission
stays, the flywheel is removed to get at  the engine seal, is this what you
have done? DC --
