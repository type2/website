Subject: westie rear seat transplant?

Anybody have any experience transplanting the westie rear seat/bed assembly
from a type II to a vanagon?

I've got an option on a used rear seat/bed assembly from a late 70s bus,
but dunno if it'll smoothly go in the back of my '83 vanagon.

Ideas?
Thoughts?
Opinions?
Flames?
