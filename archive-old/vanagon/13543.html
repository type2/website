Subject: Anyone need '68 camper-top?


Greetings!

	Sorry to post a &quot;for sale&quot; on this list, but if I don't find a 
home for this item YESTERDAY, it's going to the dump. 
	My bro. bought a 68 for parts, and scrapped what he didn't need-
except the small (4'x4'?) square pop-top.  No canvas, just the top.  Does 
anyone need it?  Seattle area. Email to address below...

	A pinch to anyone not wearin' kelly-green knickers, mates.
