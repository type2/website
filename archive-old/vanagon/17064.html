&gt; What do you all think about going out for beer/food in the evening on
&gt; Thursday, May 25? There are some fine bars &amp; restaurants in my
&gt; neighborhood. Afterwards we can all caravan to the BBTA campground, 25
&gt; minutes away.

I thought we weren't supposed to show up at the campground until Friday??

&gt; If you arrive into town late, you could still call in for directions. I'll
&gt; bring the cellular phone with me: (314) 740-2217. Lemme know what your
&gt; plans are. --  Sami

I plan on arriving in St. Louis Thursday, and would be interested in the
beer/food thing, although I won't be able to stay late.
