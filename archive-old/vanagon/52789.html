Subject: Re: How do you FEEL about tires?

Rob, I am REALLY impressed with the Y370's.  They are very tough, and 
can take the load of our Syncro very well.  They have stiff enough 
sidewalls to provide excellent handling, relatively quiet, excellent 
wet/dry handling as well.  I hardly use the van in winter, but on ice 
and snow, I have found them to behave very well.  The Syncro is so 
heavy, and that's probably why they are so good in the snow anyway.  
Personally, they are best tire for the Vanagon, period!  I'm on our 
second set now.  They aren't cheap, but you get what you pay for.
The Y370 is designated as an All Season (M &amp; S) tire, but is almost 
an all terrain type tire tread.  Quite aggressive.  Compared to the 
Continental TS740 snow tire that I had, the Y370 will clean them up.

&gt; Now that there's an inch or two of ice on the local(Montana) roads I'm
&gt; shopping for tires. Yokohamas or Radial T/A. I drive an 87 Synchro. i
&gt; Have read so much data about the Yokos, etc, What I really want to know
&gt; is why people like the tires they've got. Thanks...... Rob
