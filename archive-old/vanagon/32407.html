The California Camping Crazies (CCC's) had our first 
anniversary group gathering this past weekend at Pfeiffer/Big 
Sur State Park.  Thanks to John Hugenard for suggesting this - 
it was, I think, exactly to the day one year ago that all the 
hysteria began at this very same location.

I arrived first around 2:30 Friday afternoon.  I initially had 
planned to pick up BradleyM and anyone else interested in 
caravaning Friday noonish, but when I phoned Bradley to say I 
was on the way, he said with some manic agitation that he was 
not nearly ready - that he was experimenting with some explosives, 
with everything was laid out on his front lawn, and that he 
needed more &quot;time.&quot;  Right away I had this image of him trying 
to see just how much magnesium, oxidizer, and thermite a bread 
loaf could hold, and decided if I wanted to get there before 
sunset and/or alive, I'd better head south without the caravan.  
The drive was beautiful - quite unlike the 30's temperatures and 
gale wind forces we experienced a year ago.  I drove 85 whenever 
possible and got there in 30 minutes less expected.    

Al Hubbard arrived shortly after me.  I must explain that there 
are two faithful members of the CCC, neither of whom have 
busses/vans, but are definitely core members, having attended 
events a significant number of times.  One is Al, and the other 
is Jeff Schneiter.  Well maybe three if you count Jeff's dog, 
Argo. Al has Jetta; even though it's water-cooled, we still 
allow him to be with us.  Jeff has a Honda, but he's a great 
cook.  

We were unable to procure the same site as last year due to 
the new, nasty park ranger's decision to close down the back 
half of the facility at this time of year.  But we found a 
space near an open clearing, where, with two vehicles allowed 
per sit, we could all be relatively close together.  Unfortunately 
this also put us near non-vanagon.lenti campers, and this always 
seems to cause &quot;problems.&quot;  Read on.

Tobin and Christa Copely, unable to attend in person this year, 
but nevertheless wishing to be with us spiritually, sent a package 
of tasty dried prunes for communion.  Alas, the package didn't 
arrive until over the weekend, so they will have to be 
burned/eaten/otherwise sacrificed at a future gathering.

Throughout the late afternoon and evening, people from near and 
far trickled in.  These things sometimes fade into a haze for me, 
but I think it was on this day that Stafford, Schwarze, and 
Hugenards with already veteran camper new baby Jill arrived.  
Bradley finally drifted in with a pile of wood so large, there 
was barely anything but that in his bus.  (This was partly 
because I was supposed to bring a load, but lacked last minute 
time to get some, so I negotiated with Bradley that he would 
bring MY share of wood if I'd bring rum for people to drink and 
spit into the fire to watch explode.  I highly recommend that 
high-proof stuff with a screen on the bottle opening - why, you 
don't even have to prewarm it in your mouth!)  

It's a good thing we suddenly had so much wood, because certain 
other members of our group who shall remain nameless (Schwarze, 
do you read me?) thought when I said &quot;bring wood&quot; it meant 
bring one log.  NOT.

As a tribute to our split generation ancestors, Al Knoll 
brought a token offering of Screaming Yellow Zonkers, which 
some of you may remember as the product from the '60s 
aimed/marketed specifically at people with the &quot;munchies.&quot;  
This was a real hit, and I think we should make it a ritual 
each time.  It brought a lot of smiles from those who 
&quot;remembered.&quot; J:)

Jack Stafford brought a wonderful yeast/wheat German home brew.  
I think someone should make him some fancy transporter porter 
labels.  This stuff is very lush - quite exotic.  We drank it 
out of his keg, with lemon.  That with wine, hot-mulled wine, 
the zonkers, and some very exquisite single malt scotches Al K. 
brought along got some of us pretty wasted pretty fast.  (I 
drink only on vanagon outings - I swear.  :)

Jack's other magnificent contribution were his powerful bottle 
rockets, which I finally learned how to set off, and at one point, 
two at once.  It was finally explained to me that these things 
pack such a wallop because Jack in his craftiness, ignites them 
with hard-to-find canon fuse.  When I heard Al K. tell the story 
of the canon model he made in high school, this got me thinking 
that it would be fun to get a LOT more canon fuse, and shoot 
vanagon members out of canons at the next outing.  For some 
reason, I didn't get much enthusiastic response from others 
on this, so I guess I'll have to drum up a way to make the 
feat more enticing somehow.  

Anyway, we discovered by fastening encapsulated magnesium t
urnings onto the top of the rockets that they would burst 
into fireworks in the sky, and this began a discussion on how 
to make various colored homemade fireworks for future outings.  
I can't wait!

Now, all this hullabaloo with the rockets and fireworks made a 
fair amount of unusual and loud noise in this state park.  
Apparently enough disturbance of the peace to cause at least 
one camper's dog a lot of anguish, which caused the WHOLE park 
more of the same.  At any rate, this irate dog owner complained 
more than once to the &quot;authorities&quot; about sounds and 
questionable behavior coming from our direction, and so we 
were routinely &quot;visited&quot; by nice and sometimes less than nice 
official people from various agencies.  Some of these visits 
would come in the morning, when I was trying to sleep in, so 
I learned to just wait until I saw the nice ranger truck drive 
away.  I think we got 3 official complaints, and are next time 
trying to see if we can up that record and still not get 
arrested.  :)  I thought it would be a cute idea to get 
several yards of canon fuse and have one last lone bottle 
rocket explode just about 5 minutes after we all left the 
park, but Stafford had already used up most of the stash.  

Unfortunately we couldn't access AC or phone power as hoped.  
I had had this fantasy of hooking up the laptop to one of 
those tiny video cam-balls, sending the live image out at 
5 minute refresh rates to Schwarze's home-page, and thus 
let the rest of the 530 of you &quot;watch&quot; us camp live, but 
it didn't work out.  

The water wasn't quite warm enough for me, but there were 
showers!  :)  

More people arrived on Sat.:  Bob Hoover (yes, he IS real), 
Harvey Chao, and maybe some others.  I got up kinda late.  
Bob made camp coffee for us by boiling water in a large coffee 
can, and hand hammering/pounding coffee beans.  We strained 
this thru a filter, and it wasn't bad!

Dave, Nikki, and Max Kautz drove in later, bringing lots of 
confectionery goodies like pies and such, and the kids had 
a good time with Jeff S's guest Travis.  I was pretty impressed 
that Jeff would let 11-year old Travis drive his Honda all 
around the state park.  The world needs more people like Jeff.  
Dave K. inaugurated his folding porta-potti; we asked to tie 
the product to a bottle rocket, but I think we were too late.

We got to meet new camper Kirk van Drouten, who taught us 
all a clever way to make chicken using a Dutch oven and 
charcoal briquettes on the top and bottom.

Dogs in attendance were Molly van Drouten, Argo Schneiter, 
Tonto Hugenard, and Zoe Kautz.  Well, and a vicious stray 
now and then.  

The next morning Steve Hoge showed, en route to taking a 
bike ride in the area.  All this time, from about Saturday 
morning in the wee hours on, a group had been partying next 
to us in a blue air-cooled vanagon, but hadn't said anything, 
so we figured they were not with us.  Turns out they 
WERE - but they were so into their partying, that they &quot;forgot&quot; 
to tell us until Sunday morning.  Welcome new members Steve T., 
and his friends Helen, Mae, and someone else whose name 
I can't remember.  

All in all, it was I think the largest turnout we've ever 
had, and a lot of nice bonding took place.  Thanks to 
everyone who showed up for being there, and for your 
contributions of cuisine, wood, alcohol, explosives, and 
general character, wit, and charm.
