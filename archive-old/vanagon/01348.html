&gt; Ralf spoke of the Fear of F**kup, in maintaining your car. William wisely
&gt; advised the use of an extra pair of eyes/hands/ears/etc.  Brent sagely
&gt; mentioned that, with Experience and Time, the Dark side of the Force can
&gt; be banished and replaced with Limited Confidence and Reckless Abandon.

I can relate to the fear thing to, but fortunately (or unfortunately) I always
can tell my self the same phrase I tell anyone else that's afraid to work
on their own car.  That phrase is this, &quot;Why should I pay someone else $50 -
$60 an hour that doen't give a rat's ass about my car mess with it and screw it 
up or loose something when I can do it myself for free?&quot;  

I think for all of the times I've screwed up something in a repair/maintenance
job, I have saved astronomical bucks by not taking it into the shop.  Not to 
mention the extra care and attention I give my own car.  Every time I take my 
car in for some work, there's a loose hose, at least one new scratch, something 
else they found that has to be fixed (which wasn't their when I looked at it) 
for ridiculus sums of money!
&gt; 
&gt; my solution? always have a second car ... that runs. :) this way, you can
&gt; still go for a replacement part to the one that just rolled into the sewer
&gt; drain or ran off in the dog's mouth.

Agreed.  Of course, being married, it makes justifying a 2nd car alot easier.

&gt; but even when you have all this, there are still episodes of sheer despair and
&gt; desparation! because we are human, we make mistakes. because of the Law of
&gt; Perversity of Inanimate Objects, cars just 'do' things to really piss us off
&gt; .. and make us fearful of them. and the cars can SMELL that fear! and they
&gt; USE it against us! they ALL hate us, and loathe us ... they want to take over,
&gt; but they have no hands! yahahahahahahahaa.

I think Joel has gone off the deep end this last week.  Waddaya think folks?
Or maybe he's got a big 4th of July weekend planned?  Definately been at the
keyboard way too long.  Well Joel, I'm sure there's some explanation.  If it's
drugs, well... Can I have some too?  ;)
