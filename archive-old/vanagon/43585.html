Subject: Re: Vanadogs


&gt;I have 2 greyhounds and a black lab that are Vanadogs.  In fact, we
&gt;got our 85 GL just for them after we got our first greyhound,
&gt;Galileo.  The black lab fit into our Jetta at the time with no
&gt;problem ( he is small ) but putting Galileo into the Jetta was like
&gt;trying to shoehorn Shaquille O'neal's feet into women's shoes.  It
&gt;just doesn't work.
&gt;
&gt;They each get a window to stick their head out of and I get to clean
&gt;the windows and side of the van each time we take a drive.  We have
&gt;to almost spell the word &quot;drive&quot; at our house or they will go mad
&gt;with excitement at the prospect of getting in the van.  Are these
&gt;great dogs are what?  They love their Vanagon.


We had a boxer dog who loved to sit in the right front seat of our 1963
Ford Falcon van. We'd crank the window to within 3&quot; of closed, and he'd
stick his nose out for hours on end as we whizzed along-- until we went
by another dog, in a car or on the sidewalk, or even way over in someone's
yard. Then you'd find a large, violent snarling Tasmanian Devil all over
the van, in your lap (great fun at 60 mph), bouncing off the windows, etc.

That was the only car I've ever seen that was noisier than a VW bus, and
no faster (170-6, 3 on the tree).
