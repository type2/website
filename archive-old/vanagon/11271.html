&gt;&gt; each- 6 and 12.  I don't think you'll like either of these.  can you get 
&gt;&gt; deep cycle 6 volt batteries?
&gt;
&gt;Absolutely.  They are called Golf-cart batteries, and I'm gonna get me
&gt;some reeeeel soon now.  Anyone wanna buy a 12V deep-cycle marine battery?  =)

I got a couple of big 6V telephone exchange batteries for free. They were 
donated to the University by British Telecom for an electric vehicle project 
that was never completed. The University wasn't allowed to sell them for 
some legal reason so we had to scrap about 200 of these batteries (brand new 
and about 200 quid each), but only after all us researchers had 'borrowed' a 
couple each. I charge two of these up at home before a camping trip (they 
have to be charged at a very low rate) and they'll run my bus's stereo and 
interior lights for a week easily. Army surplus dealers are another cheap 
source of deep-cycle batteries.
