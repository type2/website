Subject: `65 Bus Owner's Manual --&gt; FREE

Hi, Gang

A friend gave me an original owner's manual from a circa 1965 bus we
used to go surfing in.  Although there is no definitive model year declaration
inside, the copyright note says 1964, and all the pics look 1965 to me.

It is in pretty good shape, though there is a big blob of hardened resin or
epoxy on the cover.   That figures, given its heritage.

Free to good home, ie, the first 1965 bus owner interested in it!
