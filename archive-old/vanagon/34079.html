&gt;Next, a VW question.  The two solex carbs on my '73 Westy are shot.
&gt;I pulled 'em out and I see that the bushings on the throttle bodies
&gt;have about an eighth of an inch of play up and down which is causing
&gt;me idle problems.  There is a place in town that wants $320 to
&gt;re-manufacture the carbs which includes re-bushing the throttle shafts.
&gt;The alternative would be to purchase a set of aftermarket carbs but
&gt;I'm concerned that this would mean I'd have to switch to an 009
&gt;distributer and/or lose my chokes (al la Webber).  I've heard of
&gt;Kadron carburators but don't know much about them, do they have chokes?
&gt;I've used a two barrel progressive in the past but wasn't thrilled
&gt;with it.  What other solutions have people tried?
The local VW repair place installed new bushings in my 34 PICT 3 and
charged me $25.  I thought THAT was a little high since it only took them
about 15 minutes, if that.  I don't know about the duals, but the kits
for the regular Solexs are only about $10 each.  If it were me, I'd see if
I could find someone more reasonable to rebush the carbs, then rebuild them
myself.
