Subject: Wanted:  1.9L engine block for Dad
Date: Mon, 14 Jul 1997 20:07:19 -0400

My Dad's (formerly my) '85 Westy's motor seized the other day.  Made me
feel just great to hear this news, considering that this was his first
taste of a Vanagon and I'm the one who sold it to him.  :(

Anyway, it looks like the heads are okay but the bottom end is toast.  If
anyone has a good bottom end, or a complete 1.9 L engine with bad heads or
head gaskets, or even a good complete 1.9L engine, (or a 2.1L, or ... okay,
I'll take just about anything...) at a reasonable price, and within
reasonable driving/shipping distance of southeastern/central Pa., I'd love
to hear about it.  We're considering an AVP rebuild, but would rather keep
the cost down. 

Thanks,
Ron Salmon
