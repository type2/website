Subject: oil galley's or galleries?

Hey you English majors, 
	What is the proper way to use this word?  Some write galley ---others gallery.   I think its 
galley myself.   BTW can some one explain to me, step by step the properway to install a threaded oil 
galley plug.  Should I purchase an aluminum,  brass or steel plug  with a half inch standard American 
pipe thread?  What size drill bit should I use?   I guess  I will need to buy a half inch pipe tap also.  
Should I use Teflon tape when installing or gasketcinch or nothing?  How many plugs will I need for a 82 
Westy case? 
Thanks
Ben    csdws_at_dbu_dot_edu
