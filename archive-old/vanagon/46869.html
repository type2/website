Subject: Syncro 16&quot; wheels?

Well, my Syncro Kombi is running well, and now I need to play with
the wheels.  This beast came with 15&quot; alloy wheels, with 215-50 tires
on them -- a real low-rider.  I'd like to put 235-75's on them, which
look real good on my Land Cruiser.  The question: it looks like there
ain't much clearance between the lower trailing arm in the rear and the
rear tires.  Right now, I've got 195-75/14's on it (on steel wheels)
and there is about an inch-and-a-half.  The 235's will add 1 1/4 &quot;, the
15&quot; rims another 1/2&quot;...

I understand that some Syncros came with 16&quot; wheels from the factory,
and that some of you might even have seen such things (I was told there
was a diesel 16-incher on the list, even).  How do these fit?  Are there
suspension differences, wheel offset differences, etc.?  Can you retrofit
such to a stock Syncro (it must not be a slam-dunk, 'cause all I ever
see is the 14&quot;er's).

The 15&quot; rims have VW and Audi logos on the casting (forging?) and I
assume that they are Audi wheels.  The have a six-spoke design, and
no load rating apparent.  Any thoughts on whether these are suitable?
They do not fit on the front wheels of a 2wd Vanagon, BTW.  The hole
in the center is too small.  Are real 16&quot; wheels available?  The Kombi
is a LOT lighter than the other Syncros (must be all the missing
instruments, power steering, etc.) -- about 3400 lbs. total, and it 
sits quite high on its suspension compared to a Vanagon Syncro.

It will look real steriods with significant tires.

Any info would be appreciated.
