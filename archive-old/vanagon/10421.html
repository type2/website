The usual culprits in this are the array of electrical items: check the
spark plug gap, and the plugs themselves for carbon; the rotor and 
cap for decent metal contact; the thermo switch can easily be tested as
can the cold start switch. Haynes describes the process in detail. -- 
Finally make sure ALL electrical connections are cleaned with an emory
board so they are nice and shiny, especially those that ground the FI
system and those coming from the coil and the fuel pump relay. DC
