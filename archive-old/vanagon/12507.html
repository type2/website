&gt;&gt;Speaking of automatics, what's the reliability and MPG penalty? Because
&gt;&gt;of my wifes shoulder injury I'm considering the automatic. Would hate
&gt;&gt;to loose any hard to come by power though!


A nearby dealer has one of these, 64K Km, auto, PS, PW (air?) etc, $22,995Cdn
this works out to about eleven cents US, just kidding, about $16K US really. 
It's 65 miles away, so I haven't seen it. For those who like to go 
cross-border shopping.   tim s.
