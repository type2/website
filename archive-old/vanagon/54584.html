&gt; drum's wheel lug bolt holds.  Welded to the ring where two perpendicular
&gt; tabs mounted opposite of each other, with 3/4&quot; holes in each.
&gt; 
&gt; You simply bolt this ring to the drum.  Then, pry the drum off by hand or
&gt; with a breaker bar through the tab holes.

I can't quite visuallize this tool, but it sounds like another form of 
hub puller, not a drum puller.  It sounds like you place the metal ring 
over the studs, tighten down the lug nuts, and then &quot;lever&quot; off the hub 
by slipping a bar through a hole in the tab (which is welded 
perpendicular to the plane of the metal ring) and prying against the end 
of the axle.

The only way I could imagine a true drum puller would be some sort of 
device that could grab the outer circumference of the hub (perhaps some 
sort of band that could be tightened around the hub) and then &quot;push&quot; 
against the axle.  Imagine yourself grabbing opposite sides of the drum 
with your hands, and then putting your foot on the axle for leverage and 
pulling straight back; that's the kind of tool you'd need.
