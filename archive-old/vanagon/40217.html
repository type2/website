Well, this is easy to tell. But the enumeration would be very long.

So I confine myself to the principle and a few examples. With everything 
which surprised you I concluded that you do have/do not have such things in 
America.

E.g. you do not have signs with exclamation marks or frogs, no chocolate, 
a lot of ice, no blue and yellow signs...
