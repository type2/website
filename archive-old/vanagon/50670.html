&gt; &gt; I hate to flog this one too much, but the front speakers on my '88 
&gt; &gt; Westy are mounted in the door with 4 screws and came out easily, but 
&gt; &gt; they *are* stock speakers, as shown by a VW sticker on them.
&gt; &gt; Some mentioned they may not be, so are there different speakers used 
&gt; &gt; on Westy's ? (the front are also identical to the rear mounted in the 
&gt; &gt; overhead cabinet).
&gt; &gt; Just curious.
&gt; I test drove a '91 Westy last week, and it had the speakers you describe.
&gt; Oh yeah, the '91 Westy is a GL model and it is at Kelly Motors for the low
&gt; low price of $16995 and they did not seem too interested in budging, least
&gt; not for me.
Oh yeah, I live in Columbus, Ohio.  the dealer is Kelly Motors
(614)471-2277.  If you want to obscene phone call the evil dealer.
This dealer is a Mazda dealer.  On top of asking (demanding?) about
$3500-6000 over book, they offered me about $2500 under book for my
Protege.  In consoling me they said that the Mazda's don't hold value like
the Vanagons.  Odd thing for a mazda dealer to day, I thought.
