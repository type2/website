&gt;There was a recall on VW's fuel injector seals. Do you think these part
&gt;numbers reflect the new upgraded part? I think we are all in danger of having
&gt;someone, someday, install the old fuel injector seals out of old stock, thus
&gt;endangering our motors.
&gt;
&gt;

I must have missed this...what years does this recall cover?
