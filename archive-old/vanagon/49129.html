Subject: Re: Oil Drain Plug Seal

&gt;Has anyone  had any experience with oil drain petcocks (valves)?

Ken and all:

I ran a petcock on a '88 Plymouth Colt Wagon (not the 4 wheel drive Vista) for 5
years without a single problem. We bought it specifically so my wife could
commute over 150 miles per day, 5 days per week. I installed a petcock at the
first oil change. I changed the oil every month, ran Castrol 20w50 year 'round
in coastal VA. When I replaced the timing belt at 80K I bent a valve (stupid) so
I took off the head and had the valve replaced, etc. There was absolutely no
evidence of wear anywhere. Strangely enough, the valves had to be adjusted
manually in that engine, same kind of adjuster setup the aircooled VW's have.
Overhead cam, tho. Oh... we were talking about petcocks. That sucker never
leaked a single drop. It never even acted like it was going to get loose or come
off.  It was wonderful. Oil changes were a breeze. I jacked the car up high
enough to get a milk jug under the petcock and set it down right in the opening
of the jug, opened the valve, filled 'er up, closed the valve, jacked the car
back up, capped and removed the jug, spilled nary a drop. Then I changed the
filter (not quite as clean). We sold it with 120K on the odometer. I would put
one on my '72 Westy in a heartbeat if the plug wasn't in such an exposed area.
One hubcap or piece of wood would yank it right out. 

My $.02
