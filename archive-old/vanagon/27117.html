Subject: Re: height meters vs feet clarified

Clarification for us USA slobs:
1 meter = 39.37&quot;  2x= 78.74&quot; /12 = 6.56' (6' 7.872&quot;)
*It is easier to simply say 2 METERS straight away now isn't it?!

Carolyn Cullen wondered:
What is the height of a '70's westfalia, with stock tires, 
suspension, etc? (yes, this is a will-it-fit-in-the-garage question).
I know the bus was originally 1.9meters but wasn't sure about the 
camper conversion. i don't (yet) have one handy to measure...
just point me to a source if that's easier. don't want to make you 
all run to your garages with tape measures. :)

&gt;    -I have a '71 Devon conversion which I had to measure the height 
&gt;of when I booked a ferry. It was 2m exactly. Hope this helps.
