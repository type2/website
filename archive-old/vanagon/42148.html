Subject: Sliding Door Problems

The sliding Door on my '77 westy is missing the spring gizmo that pops
the rear out so it can be slid open easily.  Otherwise the door works
fine it just scrapes down the side of the bus causing scratches and alot
of force to open and close it.  I have a '73 parts bus which I plan on
removing its spring gizmo and donating it to the '77.  Does anybody know
if this will fit and if it is an easy operation.  I heard from one source
that messing with the sliding door is tricky.  Is this so, I don't want
to mess things up worse than they are?  There is no rust in the area to contend
with so that isn't a problem.
Thanks again,
Brett
