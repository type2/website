Jonathan,

	I have had several NC patrolmen look me over as I tootle along 
the interstate (well below the limit, I might add). I have just been 
waiting for one to give me once over.  Having been a former FBI agent, 
and longtime (25+ years) trial attorney prior to my current life as a 
college teacher, I cannot wait to determine what reason the officer has 
for making the stop.  It is interesting to me that even officers do not 
understand the law of 'probable cause' when it comes to the stereotypes 
that exist of 'hippy vans'.

	Hang in there,
