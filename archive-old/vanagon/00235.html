Subject:      sportsvans discussion (all the news that fits, we print!)

from the new May 1994 issue of Automobile:

Volkswagen will reintroduce the Eurovan to the United States this fall in
limited numbers, one year after it was dumped because of dismal sales.
The 1995 model will retain the 109-bhp five-cylinder engine but will have
dual sliding doors and dual air bags.  VW will then equip the 1996 Eurovan
--- available in mid-1995 --- with its popular narrow-angle V-6 engine with
upwards of 178 bhp.
...........................................................................
opinion:

sometimes, i really believe that Chevrolet has taken over the VWOA and its
marketing arm. :(  i guess this news-blurb sheds some light on why there
haven't been ANY 1994 Eurovans at the dealers.
