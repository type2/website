Subject: Subaru 2.2 in Vanagon?


Hello all

I have been reading for a couple of days so I feel I can put both feet in 
without cause for concern.

Has anyone put a Subaru Legacy (I think? Called Liberty here) 2.2 boxer 
in a Vanagon?

It &quot;looks&quot; the same yet produces 100kw (130 bhp) on unleaded 89 octane. 
In Aussie we can get a low milage Japanese import for around $1200 Aus
 ($900 US.)

I haven't found any hard specs but I have been toying with the idea.

Anyone had any experiences??
