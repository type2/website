     IMHO, and as a subscriber to both the Quattro and Vanagon lists,
     please feel free to reorganize yourselves, but keep me (us?)
     out of it.   Rec.autos.vw may think itself as broke, but Quattro and
     Vanagon are doing fine...

     On the specific water vs. aircooled groups, there are many shared
     interests among the Type II folk, regardless of their cooling systems.
     There is hard evidence of water and air cooled vehicles seeking each
     other out for joint activities.

     Even more so for the the Vanagons (T3s), a shared body powered by
     air-cooled,(gas and Diesel), water cooled, and oil-cooled (911
     conversions) versions. Makes no sense to break 'em apart!

     Sorry to bother everyone with this not-exactly-VANAGON-related
     posting...

     rec.autos.vw is the Usenet news group dedicated to discussions about
     VW's.  It is a very high bandwidth group and currently no distinction
     is made between aircooled and watercooled VW's (or any VW's for that
     matter).

     Recently discussions have been taking place about the creation of a
     rec.autos.vw.aircooled sub-group.  Based on this, it has come to our
     attention that a full-blown re-organization of rec.autos.vw must take
     place.  The new group should be part of the rec.autos.makers.* tree,
     and should have separate groups for different types of VW's.

     We are unsure of the best organization for the new groups.  The
     simplest breakdown suggests the following:

        rec.autos.makers.vw.aircooled
        rec.autos.makers.vw.watercooled
        rec.autos.makers.vw.misc

     However this does not take into account Bus and Vanagon discussions
     since these vehicles are both aircooled and watercooled -- some say
     that aircooled buses could communicate in the aircooled group and the
     same for watercooled.  But the vanagon mailing list is evidence of the
     fact that there are many issues that are unique to buses/vanagons
     which may warrant creating a separate group for this traffic:

        rec.autos.makers.vw.aircooled
        rec.autos.makers.vw.watercooled
        rec.autos.makers.vw.vanagon
        rec.autos.makers.vw.misc

     However the ambiguity between aircooled and watercooled buses/vanagons
     may make this breakdown too confusing, for example if you are a bus
     owner, where do you post your question?  Furthermore, there is a
     separate mailing list for Audis (the QUATTRO mailing list).  Audi is a
     sister company to VW and the cars use many of the same parts,
     maintenance techniques, etc.  Some say that discussions about such
     derivative vehicles (including Porsche) could take place in the .misc
     group, others say that a separate .audi group should be made.

     This brings me to my reason for making this posting.  I'm collecting
     feedback from YOU, the VANAGON subscriber that is interested in
     helping us make this decision.  If you have any opinions about this
     breakdown, or any suggestions about how it should be done, please mail
     them to me at randy_at_id_dot_com.  I am collecting information and will be
     sure to keep you in the loop on future discussions if you contact me.

     Looking forward to hearing from you!
