Many people on the list have concluded that the ideal tire is the Yokohama
Y370  195/75R14 Load D.  I just priced this tire at TireRack? for  $58.00ea
plus shipping.

for a wealth of info and opinion on tires.

&gt;Hi again,
&gt;
&gt;I misfiled the message (that means I lost it) about the perfect model
&gt;Yokohama tires.  Was it tire model 356 in 195R14?  Is about $100 each
&gt;mounted and balanced about right for these?
&gt;
&gt;Also, you may remember me looking for a rear bumper with a built in hitch,
&gt;kind of like a step bumper on a US pickup.  Nobody seemed to make one, so I
&gt;got a local welding shop to make me one.  They came up with a great design
&gt;and did a really nice job.  It looks good, fits great, has a 2&quot; receiver,
&gt;is strong, and only cost me $150, which was much less than a new bumper and
&gt;hitch.
&gt;
&gt;I have it off to paint it right now, but will have it back on in a couple
&gt;of days, and will put a picture on my web site then, if anyone is interested.
&gt;
&gt;	Thanks,
&gt;
&gt;Bill
