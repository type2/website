These sound like two seperate problems to me, though it is still curious
why they apparently started simultaneously. Several things to check:

1.) Is the breather tube (next to the oil-filler cap) still in place,
and running to the air cleaner? If it slipped off, you might have blown
some oil around the engine compartment, and possibly onto the generator
too, hence the red light. It also might have bounced around the pulleys,
making that whupping sound. Course, if it's still in place, then *NEVER MIND*.

2.) Reach around back of the engine (toward the front of the car, actually),
over the top of the fan shroud, and wrap your fingers into the large opening
where the cooling fan is. Yes, with the engine STOPPED, you clowns. Press
hard on the cooling fan, and try to rock it FORWARD AND BACK in there. If
it rocks at all, it is working loose from the generator shaft, and must be
torqued back on (possibly replaced if it has egged out the mounting hole).
This R&amp;R can be done with the engine still in the car (pull the generator),
but it's a pain. This doesn't account for the oil all over the place.

3.) grab the big pulley at the bottom of the engine, and pull it toward
you hard, then push it forward hard, several times. If it moves fore and aft
enough for you to feel it clunking, even a LITTLE, you've got a problem with
the end play in the engine's main thrust bearing. Factory spec for this
fore-and-aft movement is .002-.004 inches. Yes, that's THOUSANDTHS, or about
the thickness of a human hair. This can get whacked out by running low on
oil, popping the clutch too hard, or generally having an engine older than
your grandmother. If it moves too much, the crank can push out the front oil
seal, and cause a big puddle under your car every time you come to a stop
(when moving, wind pressure usually keeps the spilled oil in the bellhousing,
where it gets all over your clutch). Solution: New engine crankcase, which
basically means new engine. Not good.

4.) Has the family cat been missing since this started? If so, I may have
some very bad news...


Well, yes I was joking on No. 4 there.

Hope this helps... my $.02 worth...
