Subject:       Re: how engine oil degrades (was: sysnthetic oils)

&gt; And as food for thought, in a long-term experiment, my 1984 Mitsubishi
&gt; truck which was run exclusively on synthetic oils and changed at 3K
&gt; intervals has 140 PSI compression at 160,000 miles, the spec for a brand
&gt; new engine (and no, it is not due to carbon in the combustion chamber!).
&gt; 
Another example of this: My Dad's 89 Jetta GTX has run on synthetic 
since new, and at 245k km, still tests at 190psi on all 4, which is 
also within spec for a new engine.
