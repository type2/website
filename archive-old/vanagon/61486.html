Subject: new van list UPDATE!


For all those out there in 'vanagon' land, here is an update on the new
vanagon list home and funding.

1) We have received a gratis donation of a dual-pentium processor machine
(with lots of disk space, 4GB to be exact) from a listee, who wishes
to remain anonymous. Yes, we thought he was nuts!, but to each his own.
This contribution is going to take this list places ... 

In addition, another listee has donated the operating system and
web serving software. 

2) Our net connection will be provided by the San Diego Supercomputer
Center. There were some conditions, but the new group admins are taking
care of that. The specifics of our arranagements, our machine, etc., etc.
will be made available for all once we get the list and our list web site
up-n'running.

3) Current funds, I have in hand (Ron collects it all, I spend it
all!), will be spent on the following items: LISTSERV/LSMTP software, 
monitor, CD-ROM drive, and additional RAM. Again, an accounting
of donations and expenditures will be available on our list web site.

4) Ron Lussier and myself will provide admin support.

5) With luck we ought to be on-line the last week of this month. But, I'm
shooting for the week of July 4th.  

6) The transition for most should be transparent. That is we will be
moving the subscription list from lenti.med.umn_dot_edu to our machine here.
We will let one and all know about the change, when it occurs.

Til' then, good motoring ('puttering' for those of us with older VW's) ...

Cheers, Chris
