&gt; Well fellow VWers!

&gt; I have the craziest problem on my '57!  I am experiencing what I have 
&gt; termed &quot;Unintended Four Wheel Steering.&quot; (with apologies to our 
&gt; friends at Audi.)

[very scary stuff snipped]

&gt; What do you guys think?  (I was just positive my whole wheel was 
&gt; gonna fall off in the middle of the freeway the other day!  :-O )
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for any suggestions.

Yikes! I'd check all engine, transmission, and suspension mounting bolts 
right now. I have a '59, and it doesn't do anything like that! 

You have a serious and dangerous problem.
