Subject:       Help on Brake Drum.

Just a quick question:

Replacing a rear brake cylinder in my friends '65 Kombi.  I can't get 
the brake drum off for the life of me.  Tried a hammer, lots of WD40, 
etc.

Is there some sort of tool which lets you hook it to the drum, and 
somehow put pressure in the middle on the axle to get it to come 
loose?

On my '67 I just undid the nut, and the drum came off very easily 
with the wheel.

No such luck here.  Any information would really be appreciated.
