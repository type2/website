Subject: FS: Splittie 3/4 middle seat

All,

'67 and earlier 3/4 middle seat for sale.  It has plastic grab handle on the
back and a near perfect arm rest.  Needs upholstery.  One leg has some rust
but is still sound, will need attention sometime in the future, but ok to use
for now.  Located just east of Kansas City. $150+ shipping
