&gt; Sami reports:
&gt; Actually, I'm not driving too much these days. School is in walking
&gt; distance and there's a *lot* of salt on the roads. Temperatures are
&gt; expected to rise into the low 50s this weekend. That could give me enough
&gt; time for the installation before the next cold spell.
&gt; 
  SALT?? SALT!!!!   Sami, you must immediately return that immaculate '75
  camper to California. You can leave it with me, where it will be safe &lt;hee,
  hee&gt;. Your only other alternative is to put it in a giant baggie and save
  it until summer, and then you still have to hose off the road ahead of you
  with distilled water. 

  Corrosively yours, 

  Dave Kautz
