&gt;
&gt;Ric,
&gt;
&gt;I will try to meet up with you on Saturday at 5:00,
&gt;Franklin Mills Mall. I live in Allentown, so maybe I
&gt;head down to the Philadelphia art museum for the day 
&gt;and have dinner with you. The only thing is, I've never
&gt;been to the Franklin Mills Mall. Do you know of directions
&gt;from the PA turnpike or the Schuylkill express way?
&gt;

&gt;
That's the ShureKill expressway from what I remember.  That and the
Wissahickon drive will test anyone.

Eug,
