Subject: Syncro transaxle hard shifting 

 I lost the message about someone having trouble shifting into 2nd gear when
the  Vanagon is cold. I had the exact same problem. I would shift into third
instead of forcing it into second and in a mile it would work fine. I took
the tranny out and had it rebuilt by a good shop. Someone had been into the
trans before and installed brass syncro rings instead of the required steeel
ones. They had also downsized the pinion bearing. Jerks. Anyway, we got it
put together properly and I put VW synthetic in and it just drops into gear
very smoothly. Someone said  a VW dealer said no to the synthetic. Maybe I
should take a little out and get it analyzed.
