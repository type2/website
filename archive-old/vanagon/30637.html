Subject: re:Carb vs FI in  Vanagon

Fred Porter wondered:
&gt;How difficult would it be to acquire the turbo engine and fit it into my 87
&gt;syncro?

I would imagine the acquisition itself would be near impossible if you reside
in the US, without circumventing a few customs and EPA laws(unless the engine
is available in the US to begin with)

&gt;I guess if the turbo is diesel, fuel system mods would be required?

Some, yes.

&gt;Also, what would be involved in converting my 2.1 digifant to carburation?
&gt;What sources of info are there?  What would be the pros and cons of such a
&gt;mod.

We had talked about this a couple of weeks ago on an earlier year bus. The
most common conversion &quot;package&quot; seems to be the Weber (which I have on my
79 Westy.  I don't know what is available for waterpumpers, but I would imagine
that it is probably a Weber conversion as well.  The problem with the Webers
is that there is not a heat riser which makes cold weather driving a pain
in the ass to say the least.

Cheers,
