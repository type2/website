Subject: Franklin Mint Catalogue

Just got the Franklin vehicle models catalog &amp; note a few things:

The microbus isn't in it.

The yellow '67 comes in a white version, p/n 414, same price 
(($18*5)+($4.95s/h*5)) -- all US$.

The yellow tintop (#778) and red 'vert (#139, same price) are still offered.

If this is old news, flames accepted.

A week or so ago I called them and placed an order for the bus, no 
problem.  It ain't here yet, of course....

Call 'em at 800-843-6468 24hrs/7days, not me.  I've no connection, etc.

Joe
