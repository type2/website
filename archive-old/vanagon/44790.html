 Regarding tyres on a Porsche engine van, I recently read an article that
 took your typical NA family slush bucket, and went from 14&quot; garden variety 
 tires to 16&quot; low profile performance tires of the same diameter, slightly
wider.
 Even the authors of this performance oriented mag were totally stunned
 at the dramatic improvement in performance,and handling. They were totally
 blown away with the difference. Sorry, but I forget the name of the mag.

I'm thinking of going with 225/60-16 myself.  Higher load rating than stock
205/70-14 reinforced.  Where can I get rims?
