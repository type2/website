Subject: Maine Vacations

Further To Rics message of 7/20 (I'm running behind....) Stay on U.S. Rte.
1 , head up the coast passing through all the scenic coastal towns
(Wiscassett et. al.) to Calais, thence into NB,  stopping at St. Andrew(s?)
by the sea and on to St. John  (do see the reversing falls).  The  ferry
from St. J  to Novi is an hour or two, and quite cheap if memory serves.

Ric's right;  Freeport is hopeless, and the Bimmers &amp;  Mercs are all wasted
on clods driving at or below speed limits......Use the  Bean catalog &amp;
avoid Freeport traffic jams.  The &quot;resort towns&quot;,  K'bnkpt etc. are
probably worth seeing if you've not seen them....beware of Bimmers with MA
plates....

There are several web sites in Maine which include tourist info.  If
anyone's interested in URLs pls. advise by e-mail &amp; I'll send them along.

Best Regards,  Moe
