Aging VW bus won't go, and it won't go away

It's been raining four days straight -- and Larry's Volkswagen bus won't 
start.  The truth is, this is a familiar routine we go through every year 
with the bus.  There was a time when I thought of its cantankerous 
behavior as a problem.  Recently, however, I've begun to speak of it as 
an opportunity for change.  When I first met Larry years ago, and he 
showed up to take me out in the bus, I thought they were both cute.  I 
said to myself, &quot;Here's a man who isn't worried about his image.&quot;  Even 
now, after nine years together, I often think of him as cute.  But when 
used to describe the VW bus, cute is a four letter word.  

Larry recalls the day in 1973 when he bought his new bus the way I 
remember the birth of my only child.  Believe me, though, through the 
years my daughter has been much less trouble.  One summer on a camping 
trip, the bus decided to quit starting.  &quot;No problem,&quot; Larry said, &quot;we'll 
just park her on a grade wherever we stop.&quot;  We ended up push starting 
her from here to Idaho.  When we returned home, a friend of mine asked, 
&quot;Was that you I saw in a parking lot in Boise, pushing a VW?&quot;  

Another time, we were driving around town on errands when we both
noticed what smelled like an electrical fire coming from the back of the
bus.  Larry pulled into the parking lot of a computer store, jumped out
and ran around to open up the engine compartment.  I was just getting out
of my seat when he yelled at me to stay with the bus, and off he ran into
the store.  I waited there anxiously, expecting to hear a siren in the
distance as firefighters came to help.  No one showed up, not even Larry. 
I began to worry.  What was taking so long?  Eventually, Larry came out of
the store, slammed the engine door closed, jumped into the driver's seat
and said, &quot;Let's go.&quot;  I climbed into the bus with a puzzled look on my
face and asked, &quot;What about the fire?&quot;  &quot;No problem,&quot; he answered.  &quot;While
the engine was cooling off I just went in to check on a computer book I've
been looking for.&quot;  

Last year my friend Linda, whose husband owns a VW or two, gave me this 
advice:  &quot;The first weekend the bus won't start, get Larry to a new car 
dealer, fast.  If you let him get it fixed, you've lost your advantage.&quot;  
She also warned me not to expect that buying a new car would mean getting 
rid of the old one.  &quot;He'll save it for parts,&quot; she said, trying to 
suppress a smile.  I knew she spoke from experience.  A VW with several 
missing parts sat enshrined in her garage.  A second VW, one that her 
husband couldn't part with for reasons no one else quite understood, was 
driven to Oklahoma to retire on the family ranch.  Don't you have to win 
the Kentucky Derby to get that kind of treatment?  

I doubt that it can really be called progress, but finally last weekend I 
did get Larry to a new car lot.  The sticker prices, however, were a 
serious shock for a person who last bought a car 20 years ago.  Plus, 
there was a major discrepancy between what he thought the VW was worth as 
a trade-in and reality.  I did suggest to him that he might be able to 
get a new mountain bike in exchange for the bus; that is, if he were 
willing to pay the difference. 

So, for now, I have to report that nothing has changed.  Larry's still 
driving the old bus, although he is talking about sprucing it up with a 
new back bumper.  I don't know why he'd want to do that.  I've checked 
out other VW buses around town, and most of them have the same style of 
bumper -- dented and rusty.  I figured it must be standard equipment.
