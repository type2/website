Subject: Gauge ?? again.

        I disappeared for a bit, and never got an answer to the last
question I had posted. So...here it  goes again: My analog clock died a
couple weeks ago, and Im wondering if I can replace the clock with another
gauge. Are there any gauges that will fit in exactly where the clock was, or
do I have to mount them elsewhere?
        And....my Tach is currently placed directly to the right of the
gauge console, held in place by velcro tabs. Its getting pretty warm here
finally, so the sticky goo on the tabs is softening, and tipping the Tach
over. How else can I adhere the Tach to the console without doing to much
damage??


thanks.
