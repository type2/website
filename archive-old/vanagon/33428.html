Subject:      sliding door handle (interior)

one thing i did to remove some &quot;stress&quot; from the interior door handle ...
was to install another &quot;grab handle&quot; on the door, so the middle seat people
wouldn't have to use the latch-handle to close the door. most non-bus folks
don't seem to know how to close the sliding door, and tend to pull the
wrong way (inward) on the damn handle ... it's like they never saw a sliding
door before!!

anyway, i got an extra one of the overhead Ohmygod-bars, and screwed it onto
the sliding door, about level with the bottom of the windows. you have to
be a little careful about where exactly you place it ... otherwise you'll hit
your hand on the grab handle that's already there on the body pillar.

it's also a little surprising how many folks see the new handle first and
use it, rather than going for the latch handle.
