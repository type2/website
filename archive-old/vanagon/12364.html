Joel gasps:

&gt; no phone? if i'm broke down in Flamefart County, i'm gonna wanna call
&gt; SOMEBODY on my cellphone before Bubba finds me!!
&gt; 
&gt; while this may be a good idea, i still like the idea of a window sticker ...
&gt; i kinda like ric's idea of the four generations at the corners of a square
&gt; or rectangle.  but that gets kinda complicated to print/produce.


okay, okay, i'm easy.  we'll do both!  with phone numbers! (my 
omission)

i'll display mine proudly for the moose and muskeg to see.

But what do we do if we actually SEE another member?
