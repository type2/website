Subject: Possible new group

Thinking of starting a new mail group list whatever specifically for '68-79
buses, westys etc.  Plan to include tips and hints for mechanical bus
aspects.  Just trying to get a small close knit group because I was
overwhelmed with all the mail that I received from the vanagon list, as much
of it was duplicate, or just plain not what I am looking for.  

If interested in the group, send your name ( internet style) to me at:

A76VWBUS_at_AOL.COM
