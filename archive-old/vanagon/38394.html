Subject: question: '76 or '77, possible purchase, what to look for
Date: Wed, 27 Mar 1996 00:08:20 GMT

Hello again.

Once again heartened by the fine, fun, freindly people I find on the
net, this time by this vanagon list.
Thanks to all who replied to my questions about '70 campers a couple
days ago.
I've located a '76 or '77 (i'm pretty sure) westy which looks like
it's been to a couple dead shows. :-).
Only had cursory look and talked via phone with owners girlfriend.

Scoop:  Doesn't look inherintly too rusty. Has multiple small dents,
dings and missing turn signals, etc.  The dents include the front
piece between the headlights.(which if i'm not mistaken is one large
piece that makes up the front of the bus.)  Has some repairs to the
pop top (patches with duct tape, etc) and rust around back edges of
same (what's that thing made of anyway?)  Girlfreind reports that it
does run and all camping stuff works.  Interior looked pretty clean
through windows.
I am guessing year with my new found knowledge gleaned from countless
hours on the web the last couple weeks (free from midnight to 9am :-))
and replies to earlier message.  Has gas cap without panel cover.
Headreast on cabin seats.  No sliding windows in back.  All cabinetry
on drivers side.
Body has, well, cracks in a few places where looks like swiped
something lightly and around a couple small dents.  Has surface rust
bubbling but undercarriage looked pretty good.
Also it has a roof rack type bar (home made) permanently affixed to
the pop top roof.  Could that thing support any weight without
damageing it?

Questions:   Anything specific to look for here that could mean big
bucks or big trouble?   
What are the cracks?  Just paint or will the body panels actualy
crack?
How easily are the body panels replaced, or are they at all?
Girlfriend says owner wants $800 for it.

Well, hows it sound?  Any advice?

I'm on a really limited budget and need mechanicals rather than looks
at first.  The thing has to drive from colorado to upsate ny soon if I
buy it.  Hoping to buy here to avoid rusty vehicles in northeast
though.

P.S.  It's a hideous biege color with orange doors and god aweful 70's
green and brown plaid apholstry.  Also repleat with dead and recycle
stickers and some &quot;custom&quot; hand painted swirly designs on back hatch
in forest green. :-))

I'm reallly quite excited and happy to tell this to someone as I can't
reach any friends to tell them about it.

Any help appreciated.

Thanks
Mike

questions in the future.. :-)    thanks again.)
