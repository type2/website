Subject: German license plates

To whoever was looking for a front german license plate:
I have a Rocky Mountain Motorworks Inc. catalog from last christmas that
advertises &quot;Authentic German Vehicle Plates&quot;, front or back, rectangle
or oval, for $19.95 each. Their phone is 1-800-258-1996.
