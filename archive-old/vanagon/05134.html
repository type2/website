Subject: Screens and Wiper Fluid Pump

O.K.  two problems I've been meaning to fix on the 'falia.

1. Calvin (my Golden Retriever) has now torn both of my
   side window screens.  They have become unattached from
   the plastic frame.  It looks as though the screens were
   attached with glue or heat pressed on?  Anyway, what's
   best way to replace the screens?  The tough part looks
   like getting access to the inside of the sliding window.
   I noticed someone posted how to remove those windows but
   it sure doesn't appear easy.
2. The wiper fluid pump no longer works.  I saw yesterday that
    it might be possible to check if it's frozen or does this just
   apply to the water (sink) pumps?  Also, where is and how do I
   get to it.

Thanks.
