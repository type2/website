Subject: beautiful `67 bus for sale

I thought I'd share this with you all.

I just saw this bus today outside of the local great VW mechanic's shop here
in Corvallis (Independent Bug Werks).  It's
for sale through them only in that, if anybody's interested they'll give you
his name and number.  I know nothing about the person, I just looked the bus
over but didn't drive it.

If you're a strict stock restoration fanatic and mechanical improvements
bother you, hit &quot;d&quot; now!

This is a cherry `67 21-Window w/cloth sunroof, 9-passenger, bus.  It
is, although not 100% perfect, 99.998% perfect.  I saw 2 slightly dented
hupcaps and a part of the divider between the front and back was
slightly frayed, and one of the side door leather straps was missing.
The bus is built like VW would have built them in `67 if it could
have... but here's a copy of the flyer the guy had in it:

------------ end flyer -------

As I said, this looks cherry.  The body and interior are completely stock 
restored but the mechanicals have all the good stuff.  The thing makes me
drool it's so pretty.

The price you say?  The guys at IBW say that he's asking (sit down now!) $9500
for this!!!  Overpriced, dare I say?  It's a beaut, but that's too much, and
that's what they said too.  If I had 6 or 7K$ floating around I might make an
offer but I don't and, hey, there's no fold-down rear seat nor walk-through
from the front so, like, I'm just not interested! (grmle frmle drool) :(

Anyway, if anybody wants me to get more details let me know.

John
and Bobo, the freshly washed, orange and white, definitely not cherry, `74 bus
