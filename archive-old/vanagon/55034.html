Subject: RE: Tires &amp; Pressure '85 Westy 

Wendy,

Are there any load rating markings on tires?

&gt;From the 35 psi max pressure, I would guess that these are standard load tire.  Just wanted 
to make sure.

&gt;My '85 Westy has tires put on by PO.  They are BF Goodrich P185/75R 14 
&gt;89S M&amp;S.  I notice the max tire pressure on the tires say 35 psi.  I have 
&gt;noticed in the camper owners manual it has one pressure, in the Bentley 
&gt;another and some people on the list recommend still another.  Can anyone 
&gt;recommend what I should be using.  The camper is always RTR (ready to 
&gt;roll) except for food.  We don't carry too many extras and just 2 adults. 
&gt;I have a feeling that we are running on marshmallows.  The local &quot;tire 
&gt;store&quot; told us to put 33 psi in each.  Your expert advice appreciated as 
&gt;usual.
