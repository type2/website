Subject: Re: vanagon gas tank remove

DAve, this is no big problem, to remove just follow common sense, first 
drain the tank with a siphon as much as possible, then pull either line 
coming off either side of the back, one is to pump one is return, and 
drain the rest.  Standard don't be an idiot this is gas practices, fire 
extinguisher near etc.  OK now disconnect both lines off the back.  Next 
look under both wheel wells, you will see plastic vent/expansion tanks 
with 2 lines to each tank, a german cloth covered hose connected to the 
tank connected to a hard plastic hose, disconnect at joint between the 
hard plastic and rubber (you should replace the rubber likely).  Now 
open gas filler, remove the 3 screws you see.  Look at back of filler 
pipe, note smaller 1/2&quot; pipe attached, pull it off the filler at the 
joint.  Now take filler pipe, you will see it dissapearing into a rubber 
grommet through the frame into the tank.  Work it into the tank a bit 
further while bending down and away from the body so you can get it in 
the wheel well opening then pull it out of the tank through the wheel 
well.  OK now support the tank with a nice jack or shim it up with 
something you can remove when lowering.  Observe the 2 steel straps 
holding the tank, bolts at the front, tabs through the cross beam at the 
back, unbend the tabs going through the cross beam, and unbolt the 
straps, remove the straps  The tank should then lower out easily enough, 
watching for the lines for the vents, etc.  One 1/2&quot; vent line goes side 
to side over the front end of the tank and is held to the body with a 
clamp, this one may come out of the grommets in the tank, deal with it 
later.  Disconnect the wire to the sender and it twists out of the tank 
using something to turn it between mounting tabs.  Chances are a tank 
from PA is severely rusted out on top, now is the time to asess yours 
and do whatever you see fit, some hand wire brushing and good rust 
prevent oil based paint at least. Replace as you removed, now a good 
time to replace all those fuel lines and fuel filter BTW.  The whole 
process is not that bad really, out took me about 1 hour first time, 
back in in about 45 minutes.
