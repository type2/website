The squeeking sound when manouvering into parking spaces or otherwise
turning tightly is probably the upper control arm bushings.  They rapidly
deteriorate to the point on CLUNKING when you turn hard.  They are
outrageously expensive from VWUA, and even more expensive from West Coast
Metric (who are they foolin'?)

If someone knows of a more reasonable price for these things, let me know.
I have seen prices of over $50 each (you need four).  That's unbeleivable
for a stinkin' piece of rubber!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
