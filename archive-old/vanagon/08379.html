Subject:      need Wesphalia info

FROM: H YATES

Hi Murray.  I live out in the Vancouver area and have a 1990 Syncro Westfalia.
We have owned it since new, and the only problem I have had with it is a
waterpump failure this past September.  I currently have 111000 km on it,
and it's been quite loyal to us.  We have made three jaunts across Canada
in the van.  Last year we spent 3 months on the road, and covered 25000 km
without any problem.  My wife and I are highly organized when we travel, and
there is always room for something else in the Westfalia.

Prime examples over a Class B motorhome are such things as excellent fuel
mileage, and unlimited road access.  The van has an excellent turning radius,
the Syncro allows excellent off-road capabilities and climbing power.  We
can fit into almost any campsite due to our short length (approx 16 feet), and
it's cheap to travel on ferries because of it (important on the west coast!).
Need more info?... just ask.

Thx.
Harry
