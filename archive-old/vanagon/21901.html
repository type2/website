 Howdy, I need a favor from any of you who routinely find splits in
junkyards. I have a '65 single cab, converted to 12v, but I still have
the 6v turn signal relay, so the turn signals blink super fast. If
anyone happens to have seen a 12v turn signal relay for cheap, please
let me know, and perhaps we can work something out. I can order one
here, but as always, am trying to save a few $$$$.
Thanks
Richard
