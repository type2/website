Ron arranged to get an entire RV loop reserved.  This loop 
holds 12 RVs, and 24 of us.  The cost is $6 / person / night, 
with a maximum charge of $24 / site / night.  This is a
little complicated, but here are some sample scenarios:

     Site contains:                         Charge / night:
     --------------------------------       ---------------
     2 vans, 1 person each                    $12
     2 vans, 3 persons total                  $18
     2 vans, 2 persons each                   $24
     3 vans, 4 adults and 2 kids              $24

Get it?  If we get more than 24 vans, there will be plenty of 
'overflow' sites, just not in our loop.  This is probably ideal 
for those who like a...ahem...quieter site.

Electricity will be available for those who wish to use it (one 
hookup / site).  The surcharge for electricity usage is $4.

SPECIAL NOTE: that the campground gates close at 11pm, so get 
there before then or you'll be camping on the street - literally.

DIRECTIONS:

To get to Pinnacles Campground from the Bay Area, follow route 101 South to
Gilroy.  Just south of Gilroy, take route 25 south.  Follow route 25
through Hollister, Tres Pinos, and Paicines.  Roughly an hour south of
Gilroy you'll see a large sign for Pinnacles National Monument and a road
to the right.  Take that road.  The campground is just before the park gate.

To get to Pinnacles from the southlands, you'll want to look at a map.  You
can take either 101 north to San Lucas, and then cut over to 25 north, or
take 5 north to Coalinga and 25 north.  Again, look at a map.
