&gt;John et al - many of us in the Bay Area prefer the Morro Bay option,
&gt;since it's a lot closer, but the southern CA site was selected
&gt;out of the possibility that people from AZ and NM would also attend.
&gt;Can we PLEEEEEZE hear from those people - whether they would
&gt;come to Red Rock?

Morro bay sounds better to _me_!  I think my bus can make it that
far - I don't know where it is but it sounds close!
