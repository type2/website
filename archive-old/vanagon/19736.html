To All:

Regarding Mitch Covington's question about the benefits of polishing the cast
aluminum end pieces of a dual-port manifold system:

It's very rare that all of the gasoline in the intake charge is fully
vaporized.  It is finely divided into small droplets of liquid by the action
of the carb but complete vaporization is seldom achieved.

A droplet of gasoline, however tiny, has a million times more mass than a
molecule of air.  The greater mass makes it difficult for the droplets to
negotiate the bends encountered on the way to the combustion chamber causing
a portion of the fuel charge to strike the walls of the intake manifold or
cylinder head casting and to form a film of liquid gasoline.  This process
occurs more easily if the surfaces are rough.

Polishing the inner surfaces of the aluminum casts eliminates the rough
surfaces that promote impact condensation.  Some engine builders spend
hundreds of man-hours polishing the manifold's inner surfaces but tests have
shown no appreciable benefits over a mirror surface to one smoothed with #600
wet &amp; dry sandpaper.

DP manifold castings are not only too rough to begin with, they often build
up a spongy layer of combustion residue from backfiring or a gummy layer of
gasoline residue.  At the very least the manifold castings should be cleaned.
 Sand paper is one method of accomplishing this and will produce a smoother
average surface as well.
