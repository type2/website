Subject: RE: vanagon armrests ...

Joel,

The armrests typically fall off due to the mounting plate bolts backing out.  
The fix is to push the upholstery back from around the mainshaft, drive the 
roll pin out with a drift punch, and remove the armrest/shaft assembly.  Once 
this is done, you can get at the two allen head screws (holding the mounting 
plate to the seat frame), remove them individually, locktite them and retighten 
them (I have been told that there's a factory service bulletin on this but have 
not been able to verify).  Replacement of the armrest is the reverse of above.  
Hope this helps those of you w/ loose armrests...

P.S.   do not use this procedure to fix the loose nut behind the steering 
wheel, though  &lt;grin&gt;...



well, for you folks with the adjustable front seat armrests ...

DON'T BREAK THEM!!! always, always fold them completely UP before trying to
get out of the seat!

&quot;well, of course&quot;, you say dumfoundedly. yeah, well ... some folks (i.e.,
kids) think it's &quot;cool&quot; to leave them down and use them as hand-holds when
getting out or in.

not cool. it seems that there is a metal sleeve in the armrest itself, and
such behavior on the part of the seat occupant tends to weaken and then split
this sleeve. how to fix? ha. welding, maybe. but then the foam rubber will
catch on fire.

buy a new one from the dealer? sure. how much could an armrest cost??
howzabout $130.00 ... that's ONE HUNDRED THIRTY DOLLARS, folks. for a stinking
little armrest!! (but my favorite dealer says he'll cut me a deal: ONLY $100).
wow.

so, for now, my ex-favorite nephew will have to do without one, and i will
begin looking in the junkyards for a replacement ... and hope they don't know
what one costs. :)

also thinking about putting the old style door-mounted-armrests on my doors ...
but they'd be expensive as well. :(
