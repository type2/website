A set of circlip pliers (one that squeezes open and one that squeezes
shut) or a pair of those fiddly &quot;screw it together one way to squeeze open
and the other way to squeeze shut&quot; are a great investment. Spend less time
on your hands and knees, head resting sideways on the garage floor,
shining a flashlight parallel  to the floor hoping to find that damned
circlip that sproinged off because you were using an awl or screwdriver!

Really, they work!
