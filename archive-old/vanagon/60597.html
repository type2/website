Subject: Turbo Swap

Brent, you mentioned that you drilled a hole in the vanagon oil pan
to to connect the turbo oil return to, but how did you connect the oil 
feed? The VW TD block has a special connection for this.

How long did the whole project take you?

How many miles do you have on it since the conversion?

Any figures of what the improvement was (smoke limited torque? hp?)
(or in indirect figures: acceleration improvement and max speed?)

Do you have any pictures?

A few comments:

&gt; *I would try to use the td oil pump, with the vanagon pickup if possible. 

The pickup tube is integral with the oil pump housing on the vanagon,
so it seems unlikely that this would be easy. 

The engine blocks for the naturally aspirated (068) and TD (068A) are
not identical. The TD block has some modifications to compensate
for the increased load. These include better bearing materials
and piston oil squirters. Seems to me that if one uses the extra
&quot;turbo power&quot; within reason, and doesn't change the overall driving
behaviour, the 068 block should last quite a while even with the turbo.

I've been toying with the idea of doing a turbo swap myself, and
have some drawings of the different VW TD manifolds and parts on:

Another person who swapped in a TD in his Vanagon is Gary Meek. Gary
are you still on the list? In Germany people are already swapping
in TDI engines (90 and 110 hp). Tom Niksch sent me some thoughts
on this subject (in German), but at least here such a swap would
probably have to wait a while until TDI engines become availible
in the boneyards. The attractive thing about the TDI is that
one can have both more power (even than the gas wasserboxer)
and better fuel economy (efficiency approximately 25% better
promises about 35 mpg for the vanagon!!!)
