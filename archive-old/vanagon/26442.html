starter problems.

my 70 westy also has similar problems
I got a new expensive battery at claralw's insistence and it was no better.
I always had to get under and jump the starter switch with a small
screwdriver, or always park facing downhill. When I jumped it it always
started forst turn. (why did they get rid if the winder on the barndoor???)
after a while a got tired of this so I have done the following.

I ran 2 heavy duty wires from the hot terninak on the starter to the
dashboard, To the left of the switch panel there is a blank switch hole
cvered up by the dachboard black padding stuff. I put a heavy duty toggle
switch there and connected the other end to the starter solenoid. I now have
a second starter switch that always works. I think that this is easier than
dissambling the steering column and replacing the ignition switch.

have fun, I was real happy not to have to undercrawl all the time!!!
