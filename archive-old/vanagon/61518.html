Thanks for all of your replies regarding the transmission oil change, I =
think I'll try the 17mm bolt and nut.  I do have a few more, but less =
urgent questions,  has anyone used Redline transmission oil in a Vanagon =
transmission?  Good, Bad or indifferent?  Also, my heater core sprung a =
leak earlier tonight.  I took it, and the soaked interior, out and found =
the problem to be a little white plug (with rubber o-ring), It broke in =
half.  The plug goes on the valve assembly, for curiosities sake does =
anyone know how much a new one is?  I'm guessing $2.00, but then I saw =
the VW part number so it's probably more like $20.00.
