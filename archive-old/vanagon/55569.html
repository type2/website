Subject: Re: 15K report on Redline MTL

I recently switched my Syncro to Redline MTL as well (getting ready for a
winter camping trip to Utah/Wyoming). Before, shifting was definitely
getting pretty stiff when the outside temp droped below 25. After, things
are definitely smoother at all temps, and shifting after sitting at -15 all
night was so smooth that I didn't really make any notice of it at the time.

I know there have been many cautions against synthetic gear lube in Syncros
(for what specific reasons, I do not know), but if you spend much time in
severe cold, I couldn't imagine going without it.
