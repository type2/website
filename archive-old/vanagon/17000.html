Eugene

I think I found part of the problem.  When putting oil in last week I
noticed that one of the clips that keeps my distributor cap on had come
adrift.  It could have been loose all along.  No more rattling but still
have to get a loan of a timing light.

BTW, do you know if it is true that I should be able to use unleaded petrol?

Thanks

Tracey

&gt; &gt;I have a 72 Kombi.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I put an 88 kit through it (barrels and pistons and new heads) what else
&gt; &gt;should be changed???
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I have a problem with rattles too.  I'm not sure if the tappets (//) need
&gt; &gt;adjusting or judt the timing.  Could it just be timing?  It was lacking
&gt; &gt;power, but I changed the position of the distributor to where I rememberd by
&gt; &gt;sight and it improved heaps.  I suppose I need a timing light to get it
&gt; &gt;exact, but was wondering if that could cause the rattling.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Thanks in advance.

&gt; Dear Tracey,
&gt; 
&gt; There are many things that could be wrong here, but I think you should start
&gt; with a thorough valve train check.  Make sure all the pushrods are properly
&gt; seated in their followers within the engine and out at the rocker arms.
&gt; Then go over the valves again very carefully, check for seized, or loose
&gt; rockers, and anything else goofy.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes indeed, get a timing light, or at least a continuity tester so you can
&gt; set and know where it is, very important over the life of your engine.  Was
&gt; this a 1600 engine?  I thought '72 had a type IV.  If it was a 1600 you've
&gt; raised the compression on your engine (with the 88's) and should be using
&gt; premium and may need to retard your timing a pinch or something.  Us desktop
&gt; detectives need more information here.
&gt; 
&gt; Rattles don't sound like they have anything to do with, like a wobbly fan or
&gt; something?
&gt; 
&gt; Didn't forget something deep in the engine like piston pin keepers or
&gt; something, eh?
&gt; 
&gt; Shooting in the dark now,
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck,
&gt; Eugene
&gt; '71 but have had '71 squareback, '63, '65, '67, '75 bug, ....
