Subject: Wanted Vanagon Westy (Syncro?), and SOme info. on a '59 double door.

I am no longer a subscriber to this list as the quantity of mail became too
daunting (after leaving town for a few days I came back to 600+ new mesages).
But I would like to ask ya'll for some help.

A friend of mine, Mike Atkinson, called me last night assigning me the
task of finding him a vanagon.  He is looking for a late model (square 
headlights) Vanagon Westfellia, preferably a Syncro.  It must be rust 
free, but location is not a problem as he is willing to travel to pick
one up.  If you have any info. on one that is available, please contact
Mike _at_ 1-800-473-2282 (work) or 1-406-256-3923 (home), or you can send
me the info. at Vogt_at_vax1.mankato.msus_dot_edu   

Thanks in advance for any help you can offer.

Heath Vogt

P.S. Does anyone know of a semi-inexpensive way to put disk brakes on a '59
bus without modifing it so much that it couldn't be returned to stock?

I am also curious if any of you Type II Gurus know a production / importation 
number on '59 Cargo Vans with Double doors on both passenger and drivers sides.
I purchaced one on Sunday and don't know a whole lot about the production
numbers other than any '59 bus is rare.  thanks again.
