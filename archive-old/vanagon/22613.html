OK, I just returned from a trip to the coast (from 2800' to Sealevel) and 
was perplexed by an odd behavior in the idle speed: At sealevel it would 
stay at 16-1700 rpm unless I partially stalled it down to 8-900, where it 
would stay quite happily. This behavior persisted until I returned home 
this afternoon, and now it's working purrfectly :)

What's going on here?
