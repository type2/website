Subject: Re: BUSES, VALUE, &amp; RESALE

Stuff like how to value an old vehicle varies from state
to state, and from insurance company to insurance company.
I'm using Allstate here in MI (one of those &quot;no-fault&quot;
states) and they will say they value each car on a case-by-case
basis.  I think they got burned a bunch of times on people
claiming very high value for their cars, with bogus
&quot;appraisals&quot; and comparisons to mint condition show winners.
So they told me to very carefully document the conditio
I bought the car in, and improvements I made, including hours,
etc.  Of course I still have to argue with them if it
gets wrecked, but I guess it's better than having them
already decided it's worth $650.

&gt; Has anyone out there ever seen a real &quot;bluebook&quot; for older buses?  From an

&gt; about a '78 bus, IN DC, &amp; I'M IN MY 20's.  I was told that personal property 
&gt; tax would be $25.  This is great for now, but what happens when some fool 
&gt; hits me? (After all, DC can be pretty crazy)  Do I get a check from the 
&gt; insurance company for $50 because that's all it is worth?  I know an 
&gt; appraiser can give a value for an individual vehicle, but I was wondering if 
&gt; indeed there are older bluebook values with fair, good, excellent 
&gt; conditions, etc.  I seldom see buses for sale here in Wash DC and they vary 
&gt; so much that is almost impossible to compare.  I am going nuts trying to get 
&gt; one (even though I've never even stuck my head in one).  If I had a baseline 
&gt; &quot;value&quot;, I could add or subtract extra costs necessary to get it in the 
&gt; condition I want.  Again, any advise is appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!!!!!!!!!
