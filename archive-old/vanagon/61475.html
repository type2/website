Subject: engine re-assembly &amp; install '81

Well, the great day is fast approaching.  A REALLY BIG truck backed into my
driveway earlier today to pick up the long block from my '81 Westie.  The
rebuilder (AVP) tells me I will have the &quot;new&quot; engine in 7 to 10 days.

This is my first time doing this.  Engine came out OK, and no real problems
removing the parts to get down to the long block.  However, what I have now
look an awful lot like a really hard jigsaw puzzle.

If anybody could help me with some tips, I would be very grateful.  For
instance, I pretty much took the parts off as I could get to them.  What is
the correct order for reassembly?  Should I put the exhaust on before or
after the engine is in the vehicle?  Any other hard-earned advice?
Anything special to do before I try to start it the first time?  Any parts
I should be sure to replace?  (Already replacing gas line, injectors, temp
sensor, and engine wiring if I can find it.)

Thanks,
