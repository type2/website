Subject: Re: Brake job (1962) - prt 2

i dont know how i sent that - doh!  My computer is alive!!!!!

ok,    taking the cylinder off wont help getting the shoes off

To check cylinder:

1) any obvious leaks?  ie, are the brake shoes soaked?

2) pry back rubber dust cap - is it wet under it?  It should be dry.

3) after taking shoes off, pull the center pistons out of each cylinder.  Is
it smooth, or pitted?  It should be perfectly smooth.  Undoing the bleeder
valves helps to get the pistons out as it releases the vacuum.  put a big
screwdriver in the slott, and wiggle twist pull.

if it's glassy smooth, but still oozes, you may be able to get away w/ just
replacing the rubber seals.   How long was the bus sitting?

if ones is bad, replace all on that axle.   They are only made german now,
and it'll cost you, but do it.

btw, what is the interior of your dormobile like?
