Subject: 68 Westfalia, $1200, Go Camping! (fwd)




1968 Volkswagon Westfalia $1200 obo.

Perfect for camping this spring!
Reliable,  Runs Great,  Strong engine,  Good breaks!
                                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I learned a long time ago that it's not the brakes that really matter, 
it's the horn. Lesse, my German god incarnate sports 2 tasty high-pitched 
compresser horns. Cut me off, feel my wrath! Works well in testing a 
bicyclist's skill in staying on his ride under, well, extreme isn't the 
word, how about, interesting conditions...
