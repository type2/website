Does anyone have a clue to the following?
I just got my '91 GL back from it's 90k service and took off to visit some
friends in Michigan.  During the 6 hour drive, in the rain, about every
other time I would slow down from highway speed (65mph) to make a curve on
an exit ramp or come to a stop the oil light and buzzer would come on.
When the weather dried up so did the problem.
This has happened for years on my '83 diesel Rabbit and I always thought it
was corroded wires or something because I had leaking around a replacement
windshield into the dash.  The problem on the Vanagon is a new one for me.
Any thoughts?

John
