     This appeared on the list a few weeks ago, but I haven't heard much 
     more about it.  Penzoil is touting a new FR-12 refrigerant which seems 
     to be a better solution for owners of R-12 systems.  Check out the web 
     page at:
     
        http://www.frigc_dot_com/
     
     for more details.
     
     Dunno why we haven't heard more about this - the little Oliver Stone 
     on my shoulder (otherwise known as &quot;Bad Goofy&quot; - obscure NYPD BLue nee 
     Disney subreference) tells me that since a conversion to FR-12 is 
     billed as less labor- and parts-intensive than a conversion to R-132, 
     mechanics aren't as interested (less $).
     
     Anyway, FWIW.  I seem to recall that one or two listmembers have 
     reported converting to FR-12 with excellent results.
     
     Barring any future unfavorable information, I'm gonna do it too when 
     the time comes.
