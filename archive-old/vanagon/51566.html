Austin;
I have been able to &quot;pull&quot; them out by grasping them at the shaft with
needle nose vice grips. If you are not careful you can slip and strip
the knob off. The shaft has a shoulder which must clear the
dashboard.Position the one you are working on in the middle and the rest
to the right or left for best angle of attack.
Good Luck

you

&gt;in the past these levers would just pull straight out, but not these!
