Subject: Syncro Update: The Perfect Sleeper, Better Tires, &amp; Stud ?

Hi All,

Still having a blast driving my latest: an 86 GL Syncro!  One of my
reasons for wanting an 86-91 Vanagon was the folding back seat. Since we
have a new infant at home now, I have been getting very little sleep.
Last week it's been about 4-5 hrs a night.  Sooo..., at my lunch hour here
at work I've been taking very comfortable cat-naps in the back of the
Vanagon--very cozy, esp. with the sun's shining!  Very peaceful.  8-)

One of my dislikes of the 86 was the passenger-style 205/70 all season
tires.  Last summer I bought a set of 195/75 Michelin XC LT4 six-ply light
truck tires--BIG Difference in the handling and ride, not mushy at all.
Plows thru the snow pretty good too.  They're about a cm higher overall
than the somewhat worn generics that were on it.  So the tire swap with my
old 84 GL Brownie Bus  proved successful.  I also fitted one of my BBS 15
x 7&quot; wheels off a Merecedes--very good fit and looks great too!  I'll just
set them aside for now and decide what type of 15&quot; tires to run with them.
The main thing I need to run the BBS's on the Syncro are longer studs.
Anybody know a part # for studs that are about 1.5 cm longer for a Syncro
or the rear of a reg. Vanagon?  TIA,
