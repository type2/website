You are correct the bolts and nuts are different for the Vanagon Alloys.
The tapers are longer and steeper.  I just looked into the prices for
these items from VW with a discount (priced per each)

Lugs $6.00
Nuts $9.00 (go figure on the pricing)
Studs $10.00

Does anyone know if I can get longer (stock steel wheels) lugs and studs?
