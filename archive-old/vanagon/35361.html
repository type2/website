Subject: Parental Wisdom

I'm posting this Thursday nite so everybody has some mail when they 
get to work Friday.   :)

Perhaps a fitting topic for today would be lessons that have been 
handed down from one generation to the next concerning 
automotive/driving Wisdom.

For example, one of the classics that sends us kids into howls of 
laughter is recalling a tidbit Dad offered.  This was 
given in one of those captive moments peculiar to being the only two 
people in a car.  Listening was not an option.  It was mandatory.

....silence, then, The Proclamation:
&quot;Never Drive in Front of a Circus.  Their brakes are no good and if 
you stop suddenly they will run right over you.&quot;
more silence....  large-eyed child nodding in bewildered agreement.

heaven help me if he ever reads this--
