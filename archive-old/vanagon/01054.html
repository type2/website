Subject: PARTS PLACE and enging surge at 1100rpm

Greetings all,
  The address of the PARTS PLACE is
         2300 N. OPDYKE
         Auburn Hills , MI 48326

         1 810 373 2300

The times i have called, they have been very helpful.

  i am still battling an engine surge 1100-2000 back and forth in my
'85. it doesnt fit the pattern of the one for which the auxiliary wiring
harness is designed. i bought a 2nd hand cpu for 300$ and, sure enough,
it has the surge with both cpu's! now i have a 300$ paperweight on
my desk. So i'm still looking for ideas!

  If anyone has a copy of the 'bosch bible', BOSCH FUEL INJECTION AND
ENGINE MANAGEMENT, would you mind looking if it has much about digiJET
ENGINE MANAGEMENT, would you mind looking if it has much about digiJET?
systems and if there is a way to check the control unit?

   Thanks, 
 Bill
