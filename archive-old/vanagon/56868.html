Good Morning America's &quot;Road Trip&quot; series was in Nashville
TN this morning, showing off their 97 EV VR6 Rialta.  The
reporter was comparing her Rialta to some other RV's in the
RV park they were in.   Not having seen the inside of a
Rialta, I was surprised it appeared as cramped as it did --
but the camera angle and lights were not very good for a
meaningful judgement.  It was interesting listening to some
of the RVers talking about &quot;camping&quot; in their 45' RV's.  The
two they showed  had desktop PC's, wood china cabinets,
chandeliers, etc. =20
