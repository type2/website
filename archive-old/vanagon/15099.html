Subject: samba server talk

     Hi Samba-server-dwellers,
     
     &gt;managed to get the samba server (thanks bradley) but it seems to 
     &gt;download *incredibly* slowly. anybody else run into this?
     &gt;

     I've heard both sides of that story, some people say it's fast and 
     some say it's slow - from both US and UK.
     
     Hmm, well here are the facts:
     
     From my server to the outside world is a Sun-Sparc called 
     IO.SALFORD.AC.UK. Between my server and IO the datarate is high and 
     there is very little traffic. Between IO and the JANET network is a 
     10Mb/sec link - now that's pretty fast. The BIG problem is the 
     Atlantic FAT pipe which is a miserly 2MB/sec for most of the UK's 
     traffic - now that's very slow. It's just as bad for me to connect to 
     the US sites : (
     
     Also it depends how you data packets are routed in mainland US before 
     they even get across here. I've heard that they can be sent all over 
     the place before actually leaving the US : (
     
     Anyway glad you like the servers contents - but I'm always open for 
     suggestions, oh and I've just scanned in about 20 more pictures, just 
     gotta clean them up and stuff and I'll put 'em up.
     
     Lee.
