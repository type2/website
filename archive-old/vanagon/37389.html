Subject: Chirping engines...

&gt;two weeks i will be swapping motors in my 81(california version), due
&gt;to an as-yet unidentified intermittent-but-mostly-present
&gt;tweedling/chirping sound (on revving/acceleration, and sometimes a
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt;constant slow chirp at idle) and the availability of a low-cost
&gt;replacement motor.

I thought this sound was a characteristic of the VWs dating back to
the type 1 engine, but still somewhat present even in the type 4... 
Or is this a different sound? My wife claims she can hear the faint 
sound of a beetle in our '88 Westy, so I sure hope this is normal....

Maybe my sound vocab is offbase?
