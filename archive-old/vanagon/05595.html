&gt;Does anyone have (or know where I can get) a headlight switch and a
&gt;hazard switch for a Vanagon (gotta fit an '85 but I assume that they are
&gt;all the same)?  The light in my hazard switch is burnt out which isn't
&gt;really a problem, but if I could get a working one for a coupla bucks,
&gt;thats better.  And I want the headlight switch a clean looking dash
&gt;mounted fog/driving lamps switch.  So... If anyon can help... E-mail me
&gt;with your price and we'll take it from there.

the dealer is the likely place (yeah, i know). the headlight switch is
headlight switch 251-941-531M   &lt;or later model after 'M'&gt;
                 about $25-30
foglight switch  ZVW 123-251  &lt;sold at the vw parts dept. make SURE you get
                 the one that fits!!! there is a rabbit switch that looks
                 similar but isn't&gt;
                 about $15-20

don't know about the hazard switch ... never had to replace it.

if you don't mind using electrics from a junkyard, you could see about that
wreck just mentioned today out in california!

good luck.

p.s. the fog light switch has TWO on positions. you can wire it either way.
the first position is supposed to turn on the REAR red fog light, and the
second position turns on the FRONT clear/yellow fog lights.   i have mine
wired in the reverse of this (cause these idiots over here have no idea what
that great big read light on the rear bumper is for).
