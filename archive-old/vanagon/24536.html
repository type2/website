Subject: Re: Waving Vanagon drivers (again) 

Two trips, same route, so. Iowa to no. Michigan &amp; environs. 

 First trip, in Die Frau, got lots of waves from other Breadloafers, but
only one from the dozen or so Vanagons we passed, much less *any* from those
snotty Eurovan drivers... ;)  Also got honks and waves from folks in
ordinary &lt;yawn&gt; cars, who no doubt were saying to their kids, &quot;Honey, look
at the old hippie van!  Hardly ever see *them* anymore!&quot;

Second trip, in Der Blaue Reiter, just about everybody waved, *even* a
Eurovan. But alas, no ordinary cars.  Vanagons don't attract non-VW
attention.  Is Blue than much more respectable than Die Frau?  

Awaiting flames from Ric,

Ackworth, Iowa
68 Camper (Frau Blucher)
82 Westfalia (Der Blaue Reiter)
