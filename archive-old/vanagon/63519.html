My AC in my Carat started getting progressively warmer. I had it
diagnosed by a local mechanic who added 1 lb. of Freon which had no
effect. He also suspected the expansion valve might be the problem but
said that if the electric radiator fan is not working properly, it can
cause the same type of problem.

I had also notice that the van had been running a little warmer than
usual (the needle just above the LED instead of right on top of it).

I cleaned the contacts on the series resistor and it seems to be working
better now.

He also said that it would take most of the day to change out the
expansion valve so your time estimates are reasonable.
