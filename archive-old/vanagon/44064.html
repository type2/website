The water in the wasserboxer engine is NOT &quot;comparitively insulated from the
heat producing motor processes&quot;.  Most of the heat in the engine is produced
at the combustion chambers and in a wasserboxer these chambers are surrounded
by coolant.  The oil that carry's heat away from the bearing surfaces may get
hotter than the coolant, but most of the HEAT is carried away directly by
coolant.
