&gt; 
&gt; i need help again.  last month it was compression, now we are back to
&gt; the main problem -- carb/intake manifold.  i have an 1800cc type 4
&gt; with the progressive weber 32/36 DGAV carb.  and i can burn up my
&gt; valves in a heartbeat; not all the valves, only those on cylinders 1


  Here's a similarly long winded reply with little practical information.
  If you'd like to cut to the chase, throw out the progressive carb and 
  get twin carbs, either stock or aftermarket (though you may spend all
  springtime getting them jetted right).

  There are some theoretical problems with the design of the kits to adapt
  the two barrel weber carb to the Type IV engine. First of all, the tubes
  between the carb and the heads are unheated. Cool metal will condense fuel
  out of the mixture on it's way to the cylinders resulting in an overly
  lean condition. If you look at the single carb installation in a Type I
  engine, you see that exhaust &lt;hot&gt; is routed along the underside of the
  manifold to warm it up. The other problem the one that is more likely
  affecting you. Flow within the intake system is not continuous, it is 
  series of pulses, the frequency of which varies with engine rpm. These
  pulses have resonances and beat frequencies and other things of this sort
  which can be used to enhance performance &lt;as in &quot;tuned&quot; exhaust and &quot;ram&quot;
  intake&gt; or if poorly engineered, they can kick you in the teeth. If we 
  use the comparison with the type I again, notice on a dual port engine
  that the mixture is carried in a single tube out close to each head where
  it then splits into two tubes. I suggest that the point where this splits
  is not arbitrary. A more far fetched example is that of the classic american
  V8. They use a crankshaft with throws every 90 degrees so that the firing 
  order can skip geographically around the engine. This allows them to use
  a single carb in the center of the engine. When a &quot;flat&quot; crank &lt;throws
  every 180 degrees,like a VW&gt; is used on a V8, seperate intake systems are
  required for each bank of cylinders. The Ferrari V8s as used in the 308,
  348 etc. are done this way. They sound different too, by the way. This was
  explained to me as being necessary to keep cylinders on their intake stroke
  from &quot;stealing&quot; mixture from one another.

  Your problem may be caused by some pressure pulse phenomenom or it may be
  as simple as the gasoline intended for the front cylinders is sitting in
  a pool in the cold bottom of that box shaped manifold. Either way, the right
  solution involves changing your intake system - I'd suggest using one 
  that VW designed &lt;i.e. stock&gt; or something that looks a lot like theirs.
  Good Luck!

  Dave &quot;If you had the problems I have at work, you'd be avoiding them too&quot;
