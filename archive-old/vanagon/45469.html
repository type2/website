Subject: Signing Off

Time to sign off and ship out. 

Thanks to everyone for their advice over the past 
few months - reading my daily digest has been a 
real education.

And now... well today is my last here at work and
I'm full of big plans for a long long trip across
to Europe - heading down through France towards
Spain and then maybe across to Italy.

Hopefully, I'll make it back to the list sometime
to tell you all about it.

Wish me luck, thanks again,

Rob.
