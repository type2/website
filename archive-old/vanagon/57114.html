Subject: WTB '81 Vanagon Oil Temp Gauge

Help! 
Soon I will be doing some extensive x-country traveling in my beloved
'81 Westy and wish to protect the investment of it's recently rebuilt
motor with an oil temperature gauge. The local VDO dealer is asking
around $70 for them. That's a lot of gas and food money if you know what
I mean, so I was wondering if anyone knows of a cheaper source for these
invaluable little gauges. Possibly mail order? If anyone is interested
in selling a used one to my worthy cause then please reply to me at:

Thanks in advance (and after too!),
