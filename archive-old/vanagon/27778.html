John,

the going list-wisdom is &quot;go ahead and do it yourself: you CAN do it.&quot; In
my case, having it done by someone else wasn't even an option as I'm just
a (relatively) poor grad student. I, too, live in an apartment and have no
garage. However, we have a laundry basement, which --at the landlord's and
the other tenants' dismay-- I turned into a little workshop of horrors. 

Here is where I do NOT agree with the list's conventional wisdom: your own
labor is not free and I think you should take this into account. If
fiddling with your engine means taking off a week from work, then that
costs. If it means that graduation from school will be postponed by, say,
a trimestre, that's awefully expensive (think of the forgone earnings)! If
it means not going on a holiday, that, too, costs. In sum, estimate the
true value in $$ of your forgone earnings and leisure. (unless, of course,
fiddling with engines is your idea of a good time...)
