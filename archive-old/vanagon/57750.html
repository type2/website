Subject: next CCC's?


The 2nd degree magnesium burns on my face have now begun to heal, and so
I'm ready to start thinking about our next campout.

Since we have so many dedicated attendees from both N. and S. CA, I'm
thinking somewhere equidistant/midway between will work again.

Nominations for locations?  Dates?
