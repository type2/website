Subject:      Big time idle problems , Solved!

Hello all,

Just wanted to say thanks to all those who helped me with the idling
problems my van was experiencing.  I finally had to give in and bring the
van into my local repair shop.  After 6 hours of testing everything on the
van (_at_ $50 an hour), they found a small tear on the bottom of the intake
bellows.  They put a new one in and the van idles great.
The knocking sound turned out to be the exhaust pipe hitting the engine
support.  This is due to a combination of bad engine mounts and lack of
exhaust supports.  The question here is, can you change out the engine
mounts without dropping the engine?  If so how.

Thanks (Again)
Mike D.
