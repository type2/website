&gt;From Joel Walker's Van personality test.

&gt;Not all gearheads are male . . .

&gt;YOU KNOW YOU ARE A BUS GIRL WHEN ...

.....
&gt;A cross-country trip in a leaky, drafty, temperamental Volkswagen Bus
&gt;   is your idea of a perfect vacation.

I recently saw a white '73 Automatic campervan getting off of I-5 on the 
Mercer St. exit in Seattle with this bumper sticker.   &quot;MY BEST VACATION IS 
YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE&quot;.  I think it was in town for the recent Greatful Dead 
show, driven by a guy though.
