&gt;&gt;I've seen a VW industrial engine before.  It was at the King's Dominion
&gt;&gt;theme park in Virginia.  Was being used for the sky ride kinda thing --
&gt;&gt;cars run on a cable in the air through the park.  Dn
&gt;&gt;on't know exaclty
&gt;&gt;what id
&gt;&gt;t did (generator powering?) but I looked at it and
&gt;&gt;d
&gt;&gt; said
&gt;&gt;wow, a beelte
&gt;
&gt;This engine is used as an Emergency back up in case of park power failure.
&gt; Imagine a power failure with people stuck on the Sky Ride.

...and who ya gonna call????

Volkswagen does it again!   :^)
