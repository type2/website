Subject: Re: Use of Tow Dolly to Move a Vanagon
Date: 21 Aug 96 10:27:07 PDT

I hauled my '80 Westi about 500 miles on a two dolly with engine end 
over dolly.  No problems, but I was driving a 40 foot truck.  
Interesting note, as people were biling out of California at the time 
it cost $10 for the truck, but $40 for the dolly. Wish I had had a way to 
get the us in &amp; out of the truck &amp; not use the dolly.

As I intend to tow a Westi bvehind a Toyota 4Runner soon, I'll report 
outcome.
