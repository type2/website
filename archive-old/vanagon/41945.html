Subject: Re: Copper nuts for exhaust

BMW's use copper nuts for the exhaust as OEM.  I think that the 
theory behind this is that the copper will &quot;give&quot; before shredding 
the studs, et al.  I will say that in removing the exhaust system on 
my 535i 4 times, (long story) the copper nuts do seem to have made the difference 
but were only usable once.  However, in the last install I also used 
ample anti-seize.
