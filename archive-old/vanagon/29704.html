     &gt; Not sure I'd call an 1989 Vanagon a Classic yet. Vanagons and
     &gt;Eurovans are &quot;Future Classics&quot;...


     Whoa! we're starting to get onto sensitive matters here. Martino
     isn't around to put in his two cents, so here are my three reasons
     IMHO Vanagons are classic, today, here and now:

     (1) Drive a splittie, then hop into a wasserboxer Vanagon: they drive
     like the same basic vehicle...they are all developments of the same
     family line, the &quot;classic&quot; rear-engined VW bus. You don't have to
     be old to be a classic, look at the classic 911. Built for 30 years,
     the oldest 911 doesn't share a single part with the new, and there
     really have been three different models, all called 911s by the
     public. Just like our favorite vehicle, except they were built for
     over 40, not just 30 years.

     (2) People advertise looking for (certain) Vanagons in Autoweek, next
     to the Ferraris and Lamborginis, and the other classics.

     (3) People will pay just about the same price today for (certain)
     vanagons as the new from factory sticker price. Zero depreciation is
     a sure sign of a car that is currently well loved, and thus a
     (currently) a classic.
