Subject: Re: Should I buy this bus?

&gt;
&gt;I am new to the list and think its great.  You guys really are crazy.
&gt;I thought I would tap in to your vast collective knowledge for some
&gt;advice.  I am considering purchasing a 1972 vw van.  It is sort of 
&gt;rusty because it was submerged in a pond for about 3 years.  

How come all the newbies get the greatest finds?  Don't worry about any
minor pond damage.  Some of that pond scum actually acts as a rust
inhibiter.  I just swabbed a few gallons of Gunk brand simulated pond grunge
on my little gem.  I probably won't have to worry about the underside now
for the life of the van.  Any minor residual rust where the pond scum didn't
coat will have to be filled with undercoating--welding is overkill.

&gt;engine has been replaced with a TIII engine, but it has no compression 
&gt;on #3 and ranges from about 60-90 psi on the rest.  The automatic 
&gt;transmission slips if you go uphill so it probably needs to be rebuilt.

And the luck continues...Automatic transmissions in a bus are extremely
rare!  Only wealthier bus owners could afford this option.  Once you get
that baby running you'll appreciate the luxurious feel of the automatic.
Remember to top off the fluid with 1/2 quart of brake cleaner--too little
friction in the tranny is a BAD thing.

(P.S. Don't worry about that no compression on #3--an old vw trick
(sometimes mistakenly attributed to Bob Hoover) is to splice an old ford
relay inline with the #3 spark wire to give it that extra umph.  If that
doesn't work, remove the spark plug and squeeze some JB Weld in that
cylinder.  LET IT CURE.  Your rings will now have that total seal effect
that others pay so much for. 

&gt;I want it to have air conditioning &amp; I found a guy who can put a 
&gt;Mercedes delivery truck a/c unit on the roof.  Do you think $3500 is 
&gt;too much for this van?  A friend says he thinks he can make it into 
&gt;a camper.

You'll need something heavier duty than that.  Sell that air conditioning
unit to a bug owner (preferably pre-67).  You need one of those roof mounted
freezers like you see on the top of bigger rigs.  Bus interiors get very
hot, especially in the wintertime.  You will need to crank that freezer up
just to keep pace with the heat exchangers.

Ask your friend if he has the proper tools to cut the hole in the roof:
He'll need a large knove, some toenail clippers, and an assortment of old
mayonaise jar lids.  Have him e-mail me for instructions if what he has to
do doesn't seem obvious.

Good luck!  If you ever wanna sell it...
