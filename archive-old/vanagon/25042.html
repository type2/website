Subject: Finaly got to spray some paint!!!!!

Well, i finaly got to that point on my project.  after 4 months of body 
work, i got to paint the smaller parts of my 1960 crew cab.  I hope to be 
able to spray the body in three weeks.  assemble it in the next month, 
and humm.  that only puts me two and a half months behind schedule.  tha 
sound about right for a full resto.  anyone elso ever finish one on 
time?  oh ya, we already said that they are never quite done.
anyway, the beat goes on.

take care and God BLess
matt
