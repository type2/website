Subject: PIZZA night SW BC, (PNW?)

PIZZA!!  Let's get the Vancouver area people together.

 WHAT:	Pizza/Italian food; Bus snooping; Yacking
 
 WHEN:	Saturday, July 29th, 5:15 PM until ??
 
 WHERE:	Coaches Corner Restaurant, 3790 Canada Way, Burnaby, BC (430-1600)
 	(On the S side of Canada Way, just E of Boundary)  
 
 WHY:	Hmmm...  Got me there.  :)

 HOW:	Drive yer bus, of course!
 
 WHO:	Any TypeII folks who can make it.  So far, I have confirmation from:
	Harry Yates
	Ted Hoekman
	Tobin Copley (and Christa Ovenell)

 RSVP to me so that I can get a resevation for us.  There's plenty of 
 parking in the lot, so no worries about that.

ON A RELATED NOTE:
 Christa and I will probably go camping up near Whistler that evening, 
and anyone who wants to join us for camping afterwards is more than 
welcome.  We're planning on heading up to either Alexander falls Forest 
Service site or the  al  heak (someone stole the 'C's) site just N of 
Brandywine falls.   al  heak has got only 1/4 mi of unpaved road in to 
it, Alexander Falls has maybe 10 km unpaved.  If anyone wants to join, 
but can't make the pizza, email me for instructions to the sites if you 
haven't been to them before.
