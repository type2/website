Subject: Barndoor Parts FS?

talked with a fellow the other day from bozeman, montana (home of dana
design backpacks for all you climber types :)

anyways said there was a fellow in town who had some barndoor parts or
whole vans??

he was a bit vague, but if anyone in the montanan area wants to shoot the
BS w/ him i'm sure he'd like to talk, maybe he has other type II items..

unfortunately he is not on line so you'll have to call him the old
fashioned way ;)

his name is mike adams and his number is (406) 222-6995. mike adams is the
owner of the vans.

michael
