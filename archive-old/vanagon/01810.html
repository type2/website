Subject: hubcap idea

On my recently acquired '81 westy, I didn't like the creaking
sounds of the hubcaps and chrome rings, which weren't in all that
nice of condition to begin with, so I pried them off and did
the following, which may interest some of you with &quot;hubcap woes:&quot;

The wheel underneath is basically a silvery aluminum or brushed
chrome-like color, so I took some chrome-colored spray
paint (simply because I had it, and also because I wasn't sure
this was available in a non-spray) and sprayed it out in little
bits onto a paper plate.  Then, I used a cheapie small foam pain
brush to very lightly coat the wheels.  It all very well matched
the existing color, and they now look like &quot;nearly&quot; new.  Next,
I took some black paint and a small kid-artist's paint brush,
and did the lugs, also very lightly.   The whole thing looks
really quite nice, and I've gotten a lot of compliments.  I think
the key was putting this stuff on very thin - so it didn't look
gooped and artificial.  

How long this will all last, I have no idea, but I thought it
was worth a try to spiff up the wheels WITHOUT the clatter of
the usual hubcaps and/or chrome beauty rings.
