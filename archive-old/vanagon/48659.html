Subject: Accessory dash cupholder

Does anyone know anything about a accessory dual cupholder / knicknack holder
for the dash of the vanagons?  I have seen one in a '87 syncro and it can hold 2
cups and has a section for cassettes or ash tray and 2 slots for pencils etc.
It is one piece made of molded black plastic and the bottom of it is conformed
to the slope of the vanagon dash. on the '85 up vans it was mounted directly
over the ashtray and so you just utilized the center section of the cupholder as
a ashtray, and on the '84 down vans it was mounted on the right side of the
dash.  Check your owners manuals , there is a picture of it in there. In my '84
owners manual between page 50 and 51, there is an &quot; Autobahn accessories&quot;
supplement. there is a picture of the same cupholder I saw in the '87 syncro in
the top right hand corner of the page. This is not a &quot;universal&quot; cupholder as it
is too large to fit on the dash of those JettaRabbitGolfQuantum  etc. types.
Anyone know of a part # or have a used one they want to part with? I called the
dealer and they were clueless.  Then again, they're always clueless.
Oh, BTW, I know you can get the flip out kind from K-mart for only 3bucks
apiece, but, ya know.....
