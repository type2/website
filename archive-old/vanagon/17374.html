Subject:      p.s. After the Unknowns ...

i forgot to add that i would like to know the city and state/province
you live in/around ... not necessarily that you live in Podunk, Alabama,
but simply near Birmingham, Alabama or something like that ... just for
the Location/Geography statistics part. within 50 miles of a big city?
just tell me the big city part.

and if you're outside the u.s., the name of the country would be helpful. :)

thanks.
joel
