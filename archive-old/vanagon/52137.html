Subject: Re: Good AND inexpensive tire pump, where to find?

hmm....in reference to pumps....


hand pumps do suck more than they inflate, and most of the 12v pumps i;ve 
used ARE peices of crap...of course i really should expect them to keep 
up witht he job of remounting tires, should i...:) all except one, that a 
neighbor had..it was probbly 15 or 20 years old, and HEAVY..not heavy 
duty, just heavy! all the lables at worn off, but it was a wonderful 12v 
pump...:)

as for foot pumps, yeah they work. and well. it just that they take a while..
like when i had to reinflate my normally 42lb tire from 3lb..&lt;i LIKE my 
tiregauge..:) and it probabl took me 20 minutes, and a lot of leg 
switching...its not so bad up to say, 25 or 30, but after that, each pump 
just doesnt do as much..&lt;yeah, i know why..:) has to do with the fact 
that you are no COMPRESSING the air...&gt;

but, that would be my viable solution, i suppose...or drive back to 
georgia, and knock off my neighbor, forge the will, and get the pump from 
him that way...but that wouldnt be good for my Karma, would it?:)



anyhow, just my 9 cents worth..
