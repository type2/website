Subject: Vanagon cooling (air cooled)

There's been a few comments in recent days on the subject of engine cooling
that I would like to see expanded upon. The gist of the discussion was that
in order to keep cool one needs to keep the revs up. Now I understand that
higher engine revs means greater air flow but I find it hard to believe that
driving an engine harder leads to a cooler engine.

My habit is to run with as light a load as possible on the engine. Is this
somehow wrong when dealing with an air cooled or did I misunderstand the
point? 

 Since I don't have a tach, what kind of RPMs am I running at 60 and 70 mph?
What is the &quot;redline&quot; on the type IV motor? Frankly I don't run much over 60
since it seems to be working pretty hard at that point( this is a camper with
auto). Should I feel free to pour it to it  beyond that?  I haven't taken it
to the mountains yet but I would imagine that that will be like leading a
parade at 40 mph! 

I expect to have my temp and pressure gauges in by this weekend and I am
looking forward to establishing &quot;normal&quot; for this vehicle.

Thanks,

Weston
