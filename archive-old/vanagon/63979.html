&gt;Hi Brian,
&gt;thanks for putting up these great pictures. Why don't you link them at Tom 
&gt;Forhan's or Ron Lussiers pages. Guess all VW Bus fans would appreciate and 
&gt;admire them.

I have some more photos and story for you from Chris Wyatt:
=====
Super pics also these - thanks to Chris as well.
I'd love to come over the pond and do some syncroing for several months, but 
...
Last time we traveled throgh the states we only made it throgh California, 
Colorado, Nevada, and Washington State. Since that I was sure there is a bit 
more to be discovered and since I saw your pics I realize more clearly.

About your pic of the I.G. Syncro 16&quot; gathering, well I've been wondering 
about something.  It appears in the photo that a couple of 16&quot; syncros have 
the spare tire on the back.  Is the 16&quot; spare too big to fit under the front?  

===
That's the point, the 205 R 16 or larger wont fit into the place below the 
radiator. 
===
Did the VW factory change the location of the spare tire for the 16's?  Just 
wondering.
===
Stock was mounting standing upright left side upon the engine compartment. 
Thsi interfered with camping facilities so they offered the outside rack as an 
option. (For 1050 DEM in 1990). 

Oooups probably forgot to mention that before when 16'' details were 
discussed. 

Did you already get the news about VW 4x4 plans?
What would you think about a new syncro 16'' version of the next Transporter, 
probabbly you heard about the survey through the list ?
