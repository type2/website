For clothes and stuff that can be compressed without being damaged
consider canoeing style &quot;drybags&quot; instead of a box. They seal completely
waterproof, and are eary to hoist up and strap down. I also
expect less extra wind drag than from a box. Drybags comes
in sizes up to about 70l (70l is about the volume of a large suitcase or
backpack). I think one could fir up to 4 large bags on the rack.
I've had three drybags and one 5 gal jerry can up there.
Price for drybags? $15-$30 at your canoeing shop or sports store.
Sealline by Cascade designs are durable.
