Subject: Re: Westy's for sale, Victoria, BC

I just bought a white California Westy for 8500 in very good condition.  
Also had an offer of another 84 from Cortes Island.  Neighbor here in 
Sooke has an 83 for sale but can't decide on the price.  Also I have a 
list ov westys for sale going back to about 1980!
