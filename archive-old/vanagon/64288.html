If the Westy rear speakers are mounted anything like the GL ('86, /w A/C) you
should be able to reach over the top of the panel (between the panel and
headliner) and touch the back of the speakers.  There is a threaded plastic
&quot;nut&quot; around the speaker and of the same diameter as the speaker which holds it
in place. I was able to unscrew it with two fingers. I just cringe at the
thought of &quot;punching through&quot; or &quot;mutilating&quot; anything :)....

&gt;&gt;Has no one replaced the rear speakers in their Westy?  I guess I
&gt;&gt;will embark on a quest . . .
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Next question . . . Has anyone come up with a great place to put a
&gt;&gt;CD changer in a Westy?  I was thinking in the cabinet, under the
&gt;&gt;sink.  Any other ideas?

&gt;Steven,
&gt;
&gt;I mounted my 10 disc changer under the middle shelf, beneath the sink
&gt;cabinet. Works great; buy some flex-loom cable covering for the patch
&gt;cables and controller cable and it will keep the
&gt;wires protected and out of the way.
&gt;
&gt;Also, in replacing the rear speakers I just used a large screwdriver and
&gt;hammer to punch through the factory pieces of crud and mounted some nice
&gt;Polk speakers of the same size that fit perfectly.  You end up mutilating
&gt;the stock speakers, but save tons of time and headache as pulling down the
&gt;ceiling cabinet is a time-consuming job. The wiring is right there, you
&gt;just unplug the old (destroyed) ones and plug in the new.  Very easy. New
&gt;speakers back there make a world of difference-the ceiling box makes for a
&gt;good solid speaker enclosure.
&gt;
&gt;Email me if you have any more questions.
