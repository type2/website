&gt; The wrist pin or gudgeon pin of a piston must be a contact-fit in both piston

Quite right.  I should have made that point in my post also.  When I
talked about using a C-clamp to press the pin into the piston, I didn't
mean to imply that the fit of the pin to the rod's small-end bushing
should be that tight.  If the pin resists going through the small end 
of the rod, there is a real problem.  Hope I didn't lead anyone to
believe otherwise.
