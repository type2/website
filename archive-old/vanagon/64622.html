&lt;&lt;  Several years ago, I rebuilt my 1.6 litre TD motor, putting
 in 20 thou oversize pistons, and fitting them with Hastings oil
 and compression rings - all chromium.

         I ran conventional oil for several thousand miles, then
 switched to Delvac 1, the Mobil synthetic designed for diesels.
 I slowly began using oil, at first a litre every thousand miles.
 Then  several months ago, down to two hundred miles to the
 litre.  At that point, I went back to Delvac conventional oil, as I
 could not afford the $ to keep feeding the motor, synthetic oil.

         On my holidays just completed, the consumption increased
 to about 50 miles to the litre. &gt;&gt;

I Don't have al the info you need, but can say that my 1985 Turbo diesel
Jetta has 140 k on it and doesn't use a quart of oil in three thousand miles.
Not bragging, just giving you a benchmark.
