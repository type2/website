Subject: Re: Carb vs. FI in Vanagon?


I don't know if this is really out in left field or not, but for my own 
enlightenment......
How difficult would it be to acquire the turbo engine and fit it into my 87 
syncro?
I guess if the turbo is diesel, fuel system mods would be required?
Also, what would be involved in converting my 2.1 digifant to carburation? 
 What sources of info are there?  What would be the pros and cons of such a 
mod.

Thanks,
Fred Porter

rebuilt tranny/new clutch/new linkage/lotsa new sounds (another big fat 
check)

|&gt; I am very curious about this. Did the carburetted Vanagon come that way
|&gt; from the factory? I thought all Vanagons (all post-'75 busses, in fact)
|&gt; had fuel injection. Can anybody straighten me out?
|
|Well, that is easy. In good old Europe different carburetted Vanagons were
|available all the time from 1979 until 1991.
|
|BTW, the Diesel Vanagon was available since 1981 and there exists a Turbo
|version, too.
