Subject: Anyone want a '65 bug

        You are not going to believe this one.

        That guy that had the 64 single cab and the '59 bug also has a '65
bug, which I saw for the first time today.

        Its also for sale, but I think his asking price ($7500) is a bit
high, but you be the judge:

        Absolutely perfect condition.  Not a scratch, ding, mark, mar, or
even a whiff of rust.  The only flaw is a 
cracked headlight glass (easily replaceable)

        The only thing on the car that is not is original is the degree pulley.

        Interior - all the panels, headliner, seats, dash, knobs, mats,
everything are perfect.

        Here's the kicker:  3700 orginal miles!

        If you ever wanted to know what a bug looked like new, this is your
chance.

        This car is unreal.

        Call Benji (209) 748-5411
