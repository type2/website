Subject:  Re: Welding 

Welding thin sheet metal is a non trivial skill. Even Brazing it is
somewhat tricky. The main problems are the heating tends to make the panels warp 
if they aren't tacked down on the right places. Tacking in the wrong places 
makes it worse. 
Other problem welding is it is real easy to burn big holes of you overheat, move
too slow.
Don't plan on any useful results until you've done about 50ft of practice
welding.

This comment refers to gas welding. It is probably easier using a little
 'Sparkle Box'* arc welder.

PS: My Dad was really good at it. I'm not!
* My brother's term for small home type plug in welders
 
&gt; I am considering welding a couple of new panels onto my bug, to replace rusted
&gt; ones.  I haven't done any welding before and was wondering how easy/difficult
&gt; it is to achieve acceptable results?  I can borrow the welding gear and it wil
 l
&gt; save me big bucks to do it myself, but I want to end up with a nice looking
&gt; car, not a complete mess!!  Any advice would be really welcome.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks Volks Folks.
