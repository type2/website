Subject: Re: backup (non)lights?


I'm afraid I'd have to pull out my shot gun and shoot the back of my own van 
if it started beeping.  There are no idiot buzzers left in any vehicle I 
have own(ed).

|&gt;&gt;There's only one thing to say:
|&gt;&gt;Backup lights?  I don't need to steenkin' backup lights!  :-P &lt;grin&gt;
|&gt; &gt;- Mike White
|&gt;
|&gt;Amen to that!  I'll add backup lights to my little list of &quot;optional
|&gt;accessories for Bugs/Buses&quot; (remember last time I wrote about unnecessary
|&gt;fuel gauges. . .figuring,  that's what you got an odometer for.)  Anyway,
|&gt;the distinct screaming and &quot;crunch!&quot; of pedestrians underneath my Bus 
always
|&gt;lets me know when I've backed up sufficiently.

|For those of you who don't wish to leave a trail of mangled corpses in your 

|wake Sears sell a Halogen backup light with loud beeper, in a unit that
|replaces your regular backup lightbulb. Now that's a gimmick you just gotta 

|have. Buy two for stereo effect. :)  Tim
