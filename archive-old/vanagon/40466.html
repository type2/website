&gt;they operate, how to perform maintainence, schematics.etc...I'm having a 
&gt;problem with the gas operating mode on the fridge in my 85 Westy and I would

&gt;like to know a little about the unit before I pull it out .I'd like to avoid

&gt;pulling it out if I can but thats where the info come in . Can anyone out 
&gt;there help me out? Tom   85 Westy ,66 Deluxe 

Burner assembly needs to be cleaned.  Fridge will have to be removed to
accomplish.  When reassembling burner box, make sure gasket seal is good.
Check gas jet to make sure it is claen and not blocked.  Pay careful
attenetion to all detail.  If ther is any leak in system, flame will blow out
when driving.   
Hope this helps,
Dennis
