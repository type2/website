&gt;Hi folks,

I HATE  when that happens!  I've done almost the exact thing before, Ron,
and man does that really get my boxers in an uproar, (no pun intended).  And
after you;'ve stopped and offered help and every thing!  But maybe the guy
was frightened or something I always thought.  But then again think of it
how many dangerous people do YOU know that drive air-cooledc VW's?  i can't
tell you a one,  now the speedy little corrado (don't get me wrong very nice
car) drivers are another story are another story I've been almost run off
the road by these guys before.  I bet the guy that you stopped to help
thinks that its NORMAL to drive with the oel lite on too!  ;)
