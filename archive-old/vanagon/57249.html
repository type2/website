 &gt;&gt;Sorry about the dumb question, but what's a Tristar?
 
&gt;the holy grail of watercooled transport
&gt;double cab, three door Vanagon pickup, syncro 4wd
&gt; 
&gt;a few were imported into Canada, some have made their way into the US

Actually, Tristars are distinct from other crew cabs in having FOUR doors.
They're totally COOL.  I've only seen one, Todd Francis' in Portland.
