Subject: CV Joints - Syncro Front

The front outer CV joints on the Syncros are completely different (and
presumably more expensive).  How easy are these to remove?  The Bentley
manual makes it look like just taking off the large axle nut and pulling
the half axle out from the inside.  Is it that simple?  Does this nut
require the same antics as for the rear?

I had a mechanic replace the front inner (it was January and -10 outside,
and I wimped out), and sure enough he messed up - the boot was not
secured correctly and is flopping in the breeze.

Is the front inner joint the same at the rear joints??

Thanks for your help,
Kerry  '86 Syncro
