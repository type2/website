So KevinM9696_at_aol_dot_com says:
&gt; 
&gt; How `bout the design of the exhaust gaskets on the type 4's, or even
&gt; just the prospect of remounting the exhaust after you've pulled it ....

Yep.  I remember laying under the passenger side with drop light 
angled just right ('74 Hardtop Camper) and trying to get that f---ing
oval copper thing to sit just right on top of the manifold or if your
luck it'll stay up in the head port.  All the while crud is trying to
get in your eyes, nose and mouth.  While we're under there, let's
not forget that when you removed the manifold nuts, at least one half 
of the studs must come out with the nut. :(  

&gt; Have you ever lost a sparkplug to the cavernous depths of your engine
&gt; tin?

Oh yeah...  Lot's-o-fun tryin' to get that sucker out.  Oh... Fuck it!!
