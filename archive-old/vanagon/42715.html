Subject: Re: 82 vanagon for sale, Chicago

I heard about an Adventurewagen (sp?) just south of here.  Brought in to 
a VW repair shop there today and is for sale.  A '78 model with some nose 
damage and a knocking rod.  $300 (I think).  Call Caldwell's VW Service 
in Reeds Spring, MO (417) 272-3691.  Good Luck!
