Subject: 86 Syncro

This weekend we received a &quot;gift&quot; of a 86 syncro. Reportedly the engine is
&quot;blown&quot;. We looked at it and the body has several small to moderate dents,
aa small amout of seam rust and the center bench is missing. Other than
that all seems to work.

Barb and I have a 87 Westy we enjoy very much and want to obtain some
spares from this donor, however there are many syncro pieces that we would
like to see get a second chance. All would be free for the asking/taking
but preference would be given to some kind soul that might have a table(s),
gray, for our Westy &lt;g&gt;. 

I'm not sure how long we would be able to keep the 86 where it is so time
may be important.
