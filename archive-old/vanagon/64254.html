Subject:      Re: Driver-side rear-view mirrors

Mine has been having the same problem and I've purchased brand new mirrors
with the same results.  I wondering if the mirrors that I've seen on later
model vanagons which look much more solid can be used on the older
vanagons?  Also, a power mirror, especially on the passenger side would be
very useful... Anybody tried this or know of the prices?

Thanks,

&gt; Subject: Driver-side rear-view mirrors
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone have any ideas on how to keep the driver-side rear-view mirror
&gt; from closing up against the van body at freeway speeds?  The mirror is on an
&gt; '84 Vanagon Wolfsburg.  I have tried to fix it 3 times with no success.  So
&gt; far I've replaced the mirror, taken it apart and tightened the inside bolts,
&gt; and taken it apart again and used a metal file to try and &quot;rough up&quot; the
&gt; metal on the interior pivot ball.  Now I'm driving down the freeway holding
&gt; the mirror in place (talk about windy!!).  Any help will be greatly
&gt; appreciated!
&gt;
&gt; TIA
&gt; Donna
