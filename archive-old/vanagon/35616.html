&gt; Hello all,
&gt; 
&gt; Finally sold off my '82 Scirocco to make space for a Westy... but
&gt; nobody seems to have a nice one for sale around here...
&gt; 
&gt; I've been looking for 6 months now with no luck. If anyone sees one
&gt; for sale in Greater Vancouver, or Victoria area, please let me know!
&gt; 
&gt; These are my choices, in order of preference:
&gt; 
&gt; '80-82 2.0L Westy with little or no rust, good running.
&gt; '80-82 2.0L Westy no rust, but needs other work.
&gt; '82-83 Diesel Westy with little or no rust
&gt; '78-79 Westy with little or no rust.
&gt; 
&gt; Price range I'm considering is $4000 - $7000
&gt; Must be deluxe model, ie: fridge, stove, sink, in working order.
&gt; I'm willing to consider a bus needing work if the body/interior is
&gt; good and the price is right.
&gt; 
&gt; TIA.
&gt; 
&gt; Shawn.

&gt; I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!

Well, Fritz's interior was in fairly good shape.  Some surface rust but not 
too bad.  Engine in very good condition and never gave me any trouble.

If you've been reading my posts over the past week or so, you know that the 
rear driver side corner got severly crunched.  ICBC is writing it off and they 
will then send it to a wrecker.  So if you find a bus that has a good body but 
needs a lot of engine work, you might be able to get Fritz's 2000cc at a good 
price.  There was no propane appliances, just a sink and cooler so you 
probably don't want to take the whole thing and resore it.  Roof needed work 
too.

If you're interested in the engine or other parts let me know and I'll tell 
you where ICBC sends it.

Glen
