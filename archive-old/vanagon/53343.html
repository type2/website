Fred,

If you want to pull the pistons out of the sleeves, you'll have to pull 
the piston pins.  Some folks just tap them out, using some sort of wooden 
dowel rig, or, you can buy an official VW piston pin puller from this 
outfit called Z Products (usually advertised in the VW mags).  You'll be 
able to unbolt the rods after you get the pistons and cylinder sleeves 
out of the way.

Good luck, David
