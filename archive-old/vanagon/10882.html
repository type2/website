Subject: Red Rock Canyon info
Date: Mon, 30 Jan 1995 15:22:01 -0800 (PST)

I have received a couple of requests for information on Red Rock Canyon,
so I think I will post a little information about it.  Hopefully we will
have a nice turnout for the next pre-tour here.

LOCATION:

	25 miles North of Mojave on highway 14.  Hint:  Get gas in
	Bakersfield ,Barstow, or Lancaster.  Mojave is just a big truckstop 
	with no other gas anywhere nearby, and the gas stations take
	advantage of this and charge really high prices.  Mojave has lots
	of good fast food, though.  Good for a lunch stop.
	
DIRECTIONS:

	From Arizona:  Take highway 40 all the way to Mojave, then N on 14.
		About 450 miles from Phoenix.  Can save a few miles by
		going up 395 and taking Randsburg road West, but only do
		this if you got gas in Barstow.  No gas this way.
	From Los Angeles:  Take 14 through Mojave.  About 100 to 150 miles 
		depending on where you are.
	From Sac/Bay area:  Take 99 South to Bakersfield, then 58 East to
		Mojave, the N on 14.  Appr. 370 miles.

SURROUNDINGS:

	Red Rock campground is in a small canyon, partially protected by
	hills.  There are no towns to speak of for a 25 mile radius.  The
	park is kind of hidden - you come upon it all of a sudden and it
	is easy to miss.  There is a dry wash going up the canyon that
	would make a good day hike, and about 20 miles to the East there
	is a large mining district, mostly abandoned.  There is a small
	town there with some really nice sights and antique shops.  I 
	recommend we drive over there one day and eat lunch and look 
	around.  Oh, there is also a public restroom in the town with
	flush toilets, for Martha.  :)

ABOUT THE CAMPGROUND:

	The campground is large and flat, very well
	groomed with lots of sites.  I doubt it ever fills up.  There are
	lots of sites at the back up against the sandstone formations
	that are really nice.  There are only pit toilets there, but
	on my last visit there I was absolutely amazed that they did not
	smell at all!!  Not even a little.  There is running water.  At
	night, it is *very* dark and there seem to be lots of rabbits 
	running around.  Also lots of squirrels in the area that will
	eat out of your hand if you let them.  I saw lots of tracks and
	droppings from larger animals (fox? wolf? deer?).  There is also
	a small ranger station there with a visitors center, but it seems
	to be closed most of the time.  I don't remember exactly what
	the campground fee was, but I'm sure it wasn't more than $6/night.
