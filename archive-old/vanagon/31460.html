Say you want to feel Totally Safe as you drive down the highway?? Sometimes
you'd REALLY like to intimidate those other drivers??? ... :)

this one is especially for Bill Killian ... :)

        $18,000 obo or trade RV or camper w/slide-out.

now, for the already-confused bunch of you, these are Armored Cars from the
British Army. :) the first one is a &quot;little&quot; 4-wheel job, with a machine
gun turret on top, and weighs probably, oh, 5 or 6 tonnes. :) gets about
4 miles/gallon, i think. maybe a tad more on the highway.

the second is a larger 6-wheel Armored Personnel Carrier. sort of a medium
truck, with an attitude. :) it also has a machine gun turret on top. might
be lucky to get 1-2 miles/gallon.

Happy Holidays to all. :)
