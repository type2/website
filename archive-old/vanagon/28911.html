In 1977 we took our trusty Westy up into Quebec into the La Verendrie (if 
spelled correctly its an accident) park. More moose than people.  Bridges 
that we had to build up before we could us them.  Two track log things 
that were built for logging trucks with a much wider stance than a Type 2 
T2.  Saw the Auroa Borealis,  Pine Martens, really wonderful isolated 
river.  We took a couple canoes and a couple motorcycles on a trailer - it 
was a canoe trip that the Westy was tagging along with - the cycles were
relays to go get the Westy at the end of the day.  THis was really rather 
far north.

Perfect road for T1 and T2 generation vans.  The claim was only 4 wheel 
drive which means you'd rather have a VW.  No idea on the 2wd Vanagons or 
us 'wimpy' EVs.  I'm nuts and would try though...
