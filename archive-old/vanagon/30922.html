Subject: PNW gathering of the vans

So far the following folks have responded in a somewhat affirmative manner:

dale_at_olywa_dot_net (Dale Easley) {and others from Olympia}
&quot;Tobin T. Copley&quot; &lt;tobin_at_freenet.vancouver.bc_dot_ca&gt;  {busless though}
raven_at_halcyon_dot_com (Mark McCulley) {not over xmas break}
&quot;J. Stutsman&quot; &lt;johnnys_at_u.washington_dot_edu&gt; {hoping to get his head(s) together!}

Not too great a response given Joel's stats of people west of the mts:
WA.W        29
OR.NW       14
CAN.BC.Van  12
CAN.BC.Vic   6

Perhaps this holiday break isn't really a good time? After this break, we
basically get one 3-day weekend per month until Spring break in early
April.
I'm still game (in fact I'm going regardless), but I'm starting to think
about where to go - right now its a tossup between the Oregon coast and the
NW Washington coast. But I'm still open. So whaddaya think? More takers?
Wait until April and the weather warms up?
