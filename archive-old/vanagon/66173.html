Subject:      Need Utility Service Flap Doors 82 Westy

Volks,
I have 2 of my 3 utility service doors missing on my 82 Westy. I have
been quoted around $50 each for the entire assy has to be purchased.
Does anyone have a less expensive solution as I only need the flap doors
and the pin/spring for the flap door (I can improvise these as
necessary). Are these flap doors universal to other RV's, pop-ups etc?
Any help appreciated.
Regards
