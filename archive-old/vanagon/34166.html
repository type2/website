Subject: Needs a Good Home:  '76 Bus


To All:

I have been lurking in the shadows for awhile.... reading many stories and
much advice.  Congratulations Thom for the RHD Deluxe.  I have a good friend
with a '76 Breadloaf that he wants to unload.  He just inherited another car
and can't afford two.  To avoid the hassle of tuning up the car and selling it,
he gave it to me to do the work and reap what benefits I could.  I wish I 
could leave it at the curb with a sign:

 VANAGON LIST-MEMBERS:  KEYS UNDER THE MAT, PINK SLIP IN THE GLOVE BOX
                        PLEASE TAKE CARE OF ME!

I am looking at about $700 to $800 to get it running smoothly and smog it.  
This price I give as it was explained to me: that much money to get the fuel
injection system fixed.  The body is straight and clean with the typical late
model surface rust on the top.  The inside is clean too.

Since I own an old splitty, I am familiar with those only.  Does this amount
of money sound like too much in reviving and relocating a bus as such?  At
worst,  I can easily part it out to anybody needing parts.  Appearantly the
motor still has good compression.  Any advice is welcome from those with 
late model busses.
