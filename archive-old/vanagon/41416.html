30?  Try 150!  I've fried more than one 60-amp ammeter doing just that.
Even without the alternator charging.  The only solution is not to let your
battery run down that far (a good idea in general to prolong battery life).

Of course, I concur completely with the rest of Dennis's advice.  :)

&gt;All wiring needs to be sized properly and fused
