Subject: Buying Syncro...

I'm getting a lot of good, although differing advice.  I want 
the camper, I can afford the camper....It's been my dream car and lust 
object for several years now...Westfalias in general that is.  Do you 
think that the added costs and maintenance needs and part costs are 
outweighed by the joy of owning a Syncro?  For the people who have 
driven both:  Does having the 4-wheel drive make a difference?
	Another big issue for me is the fact that I like to get good 
deals.  I should sell the Volvo myself, but, it needs a lot and I would 
feel obligated to tell the buyer...as a trade-in, they make the choices. 
I bought my Thing for $1000 dollars in excellent shape and the Cabriolet 
for $2300 wrecked and got it into great shape for another $600.  The 
Volvo only cost me $2000 and I used it maintenance free for 12,000 
miles.  
	If I buy the Syncro for 11,300 O.T.D. or for the Volvo and $9300 
O.T.D., Would I be getting a good deal, or a good investment....Or 
should I treat it as a passion buy and expect to lose money on the deal? 
  So many questions....This forum is better than a Twelve-Step program. 
 Good therapy, and wise advice from people who know....Thanks!
