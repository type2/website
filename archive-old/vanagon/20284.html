Subject: Re: Valves getting much tighter much too fast

&gt;Well, the #3 exhaust valve has tighted up .004&quot; in the last 1075 miles.  I 
&gt;am really concerned.  Further, when I took off the valve cover, I found two 
&gt;1/4 circle washers which have a square cross-section.  I took a file to one 
&gt;and they are _not_ metal.  I looked at the valve keepers and they are all 
&gt;present and accounted for.  I think they must have come from the heads, but 
&gt;I can't figure out where.  I think that they must be the remains of a valve 
&gt;seal, as the hole size is about the same size as a valve stem.  Other than 
&gt;this, I can't figure out what they are or where they came from.  Anyone have 
&gt;any ideas?  These pieces seem to be made of phenolic resin or something.
&gt;
&gt;Help!

&gt;Chris,
Keep a close eye on those valves,if they tighten again you're due for a 
valve job or new heads. Your valves are stretching and will break soon 
causing all sorts of expensive motor work. The little circular things you're 
finding are valve seals and they don't do a heck of a lot.By the way they 
were soft rubber at one time.
