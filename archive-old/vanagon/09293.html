Subject: Uh Oh I'm in trouble.....

I'm a bit excited.....just rang about an advert in Today's Melbourne Trading
Post.  Basically said 'VW vans (2) for sale, 1600 engine $400'....cheap but
probably nothing to excite my interest at the moment...but never hurts to ring
right?

The guy selling them was not home but his (elderly sounding) wife
was....Basically established (fairly sure) that one is a split microbus with
barn doors .... the other is a split single cab!......both have been under
cover (carport anyway) and the 1600 is thrown in.  The guy will be home after
6:00 tonight so I'll get the whole story on year, more info on condition etc
and look at them tomorrow.......

How do I tell my wife I am going to look at TWO more splitties?  Do I look and
possibly buy and THEN tell her?  Do I casually mention it first?  HELP ADVICE
NEEDED.
