I just got off the phone 
&gt;with Snap-On customer direct order line and this is what I heard.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;     			Sears 12 point		Snap-On 6 point
&gt;
&gt;30mm or 1 3/16&quot;		$8.99			$22.90
&gt;
&gt;36mm or 1 7/16&quot;		$10.99			$27.99
&gt;
&gt;42mm or 1 11/16&quot;	$13.99			$37.50
&gt;

but I was wondering if 
&gt;there are alternatives. 

Swap meets are good, and you can find good deals at fleamarkets.
