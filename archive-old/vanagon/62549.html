     OOPS!  I was mistaken with regards to the wiring of the Radio Shack 
     &quot;muffin&quot; fans.
     
     The RED wire IS the POSITIVE!  (And the BLUE wire is the NEGATIVE.)  
     
     So for the back side coil cooling fan(s):
     
          Solder the RED fan wires to the fridge's Yellow wire which comes 
          from the thermo switch, and the BLUE fan wires to the fridge's 
          BLUE wire.  
          
     And for the inside circulating fan:
          
          Ground the BLUE wire at one of the grounding terminals, and 
          extend the RED wire to run to the second available &quot;on&quot; terminal 
          on the rocker switch.
     
     Now for the semi-humorous explanation of why I thought the R-S fan's blue 
     wire was the positive:
     
     I tested the fans in the car with a cigarette-lighter to alligator-clip 
     cable my father-in-law made me several years ago to replace one I loaned 
     him which he had lost.
     
     Well, notwithstanding his career with North American-Autonetics-Rockwell as 
     an electronics and avionics quality control engineer, he soldered the red 
     alligator clip to the ground wire and the black one to the positve.
     
     Come to think of it, I'll bet that old 23-channel CB radio I tested with 
     this goodie really does work!
