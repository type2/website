Subject: Westy year-to-year changes?
Date: Mon, 11 Nov 1996 16:05:05 GMT

I'm looking into acquiring a Westy from the bay window era.
I have lots of info about the changes to the transporter
itself from year to year, but I don't have info about what
changes were made in the Westfalia conversion from year to
year.  For example, when did the stove/sink get moved to the
left behind the driver?  Is there a year when propane was
added?  Etc., etc. =20

Anyone know of a location for this kind of info?
