Subject: 1984 Volkswagen Vanagon Eats Water Pumps

Dear Experts:

Skip Montanaro (skip_at_automatrix_dot_com) suggested that i forward my query to
you! Thanks for your help.

   I may be approaching the 3rd water pump changeout on my 84 Vanagon..
   
   What gives?
   
   Why does my bus eat water pumps every 35k miles?
   
   Is there a heavy duty version available?
   
   Is this a do it yourself job?
