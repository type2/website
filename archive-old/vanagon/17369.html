Subject:       Re: Syncro Fuel Capacity

Hi Everyone.  With all this talk about running out of gas, I would 
like to offer my way of avoiding such a situation.  

I just treat the fuel gauge readings at half full as quarter tank, 
and quarter tank as empty.  Thus I make sure to fill up between half 
and quarter tank by the gauge.

With a little training, you adapt to that situation with every 
vehicle you drive.  I have yet to run out of fuel, and even with a 
Syncro's small tank I do just fine.  It just means that on long trips 
I fill up twice a day, but at least I don't run out of fuel.

Just my $.02 worth.

Harry.
