Subject: help with '83 GTI

Greetings All! 
Have enjoyed this list...so much to learn! I have an '83 GTI Rabbit that
has 203,000 miles. It still purrs because I had a GREAT mechanic in
Asheville who helped me maintain it. And, because I obviously got very
lucky with this little red devil when I bought it used in '86. At present
I have outgrown it, I'm looking to buy a bus. I thought I was having
transmission problems, but it turns out my &quot;shift linkage bushings&quot; are
shot (better than having to buy new transmission!) and I'll replace them.
I did have it repainted and the interior re-done, but the person that did
it ruined my sunroof- which now is so tight it won't open or close w/o
scraping the paint (I learned the hard way...big scrape now) Anyway, it is
hard enough to have to part with this little car, it has been so great to
me, very few problems! I'd like to know if anyone out there is interested,
knows of anyone who might be interested, or can tell me what a fair sale
price would be? I don't want to give it to some junker for parts- it's
still a good car! The only other problem is that the driver window
falls into the panel because it's off the mechanism that raises and lowers
it- I've had it sodered once but now I'll just have to buy a whole new
mechanism- or sell it as is. Any help is appreciated. Danke. Maria Alvarez
