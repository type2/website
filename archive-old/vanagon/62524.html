Subject: EV Camper (95-96)

We must part with our Eurovan camper that has 20k miles and is in
mint/like new condition. Extras include the usual pwer package, 4 speed AT, 
Python alarm and keyless entry, factory awning, tinted windows (all), bra, 
custom made no-see-em netting, paint and undercoating protection (ok ok, this 
wasn't the smartest move ever made), additional seat, still has 2yrs full 
warranty (or 10000 miles). Asking 26,000, a very fair price. We live in 
Portland, OR- the van is currently in Seattle for a few days (w/wife) _at_
(206-235-5080) or Portland 503-232-3832.
I apologize if this posting is not appropriate, but, having been on the list 
before I couldn't think of any group of people that would appreciate this 
offer more.
Thanks,
Art
