&gt;Well folks, Among the many things I've been working on is replacing a heater 
&gt;cable.  I bought a new one at my local VW parts place, at the very resonable 
&gt;price of $15.  I was removing the old one yesterday, but couldn't get it to 
&gt;budge.  I was getting real mad and then I thought:  &quot;I'll tie the cable to a 
&gt;tree and back up.&quot;  All the trees around here are huge, so I used the next 
&gt;best thing, a telephone pole.  I ended up destroying the cable, but 
&gt;extracted every last bit of it from the bus.  Anyhow, there is this really 
&gt;rich family that moved in next door and I can't imagine what they think 
&gt;about me.

How does that guy expect to pull that pole over with that little wire?
