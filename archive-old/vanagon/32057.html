RE:	sweet revenge

This message is sent to you with the hope you will forward it to EVERYONE you
have ever even seen the e-mail address of.  In the spirit of the originator,
please feel free to post it anywhere and everywhere.  Okay everyone. . . . a
true story of justice in the good old U.S. of A.   Thought y'all might enjoy
this; if nothing else, is shows internet justice, if it can be called that.  My
daughter and I had just finished a salad at Neiman-Marcus Cafe in Dallas and
decided to have a small dessert.  Because our family are such cookie lovers, we
decided to try the &quot;Nieman-Marcus Cookie.&quot;  It was so excellent that I asked if
they would give me the recipe and they said with a small frown, &quot;I'm afraid
not.&quot;  Well, I said, would you let me buy the recipe?  With a cute smile, she
said, &quot;Yes.&quot;  I asked how much, and she responded, &quot;Two-fifty.&quot;  I said with
approval, just add it to my tab.  Thirty days later, I received my VISA
statement from Neiman-Marcus and it was $285.00.  I looked again and I
remembered I had only spent $9.95 for two salads and about $20.00 for a scarf.
As I glanced at the bottom of the statement, it said, &quot;Cookie Recipe - $250.00.&quot;
Boy, was I upset!!  I called Neiman's Accounting Dept. and told them the
waitress said it was &quot;two-fifty,&quot; and I did not realize she meant $250.00 for a
cookie recipe.  I asked them to take back the recipe and reduce my bill and they
said they were sorry, but because all the recipes were this expensive so not
just everyone could duplicate any of our bakery recipes . . . the bill would
stand.  I waited, thinking of how I could get even or even try to get any of my
money back.  I just said, &quot;Okay, you folks got my $250.00 and now I'm going to
have $250.00 worth of fun.&quot;  I told her that I was going to see to it that every
cookie lover will have a $250.00 cookie recipe from Neiman-Marcus for nothing.
She replied, &quot;I wish you wouldn't do this.&quot;  I said, &quot;I', sorry but this is the
only way I feel I could get even,&quot; and I will.  So, here it is, and please pass
it to someone else or run a few copies . . .  I paid for it; now you can have it
for free.

(Recipe may be halved):
2 Cups butter
4 Cups flour
2 tsp soda
2 Cups sugar
5 Cups oatmeal
24 oz chocolate chips
2 Cups brown sugar
1 tsp salt
1 8 oz Hershey bar (grated)
4 eggs
2 tsp baking powder
3 Cups chopped nuts (your choice)
2 tsp vanilla

Measure oatmeal and blend in a blander to a fine powder.  Cream the butter and
both sugars.  Add eggs and vanilla; mix together with flour, oatmeal, salt,
baking powder, and soda.  Add chocolate chips, Hershey bar and nuts.  Roll into
balls and place two inches apart on a cookie sheet.  Bake for 10 minutes at 375
degrees.  Makes 112 cookies.

Have fun!!  This is not a joke --- this is a true story.  That's it.  Please,
pass it along to everyone you know, single people, mailing lists, etc. . . .
