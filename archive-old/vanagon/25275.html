Subject: loose mirrors &amp; scratched paint


Hello!
A few questions concerning my Vanagon Westy '86, brown.

1.
Does anyone know what to do with side mirrors that won't stay
in place anymore? We've tightened the nuts on one of them 'till
it got stripped (or maybe it was stripped before, I don't know)
so we have to change that one; can just the screw in it be 
changed? The other one is either so loose the wind moves it, or
so tight that I can't position it! What are we doing wrong??

2.
My &quot;beloved&quot; brushed by a concrete post when backing down the 
underground garage ramp after stauling the van. The rear panel
on the driver side has some surface scratches in the paint.
You can see the metal now, but it doesn't seem to be dented.
(I didn't look at it too long, it was too painful!_at_#%_at_)
What should I do to minimize chances of it rusting quicker than 
the rest of the vehicle? Also, how can I find the right paint?
Brian says that the colour has faded and the original colour 
number won't match after 9 years.

Direct replies are much appreciated. I'm trying to catch up
with the messages, but I'm falling behind more and more every
day!
Thanks!

Darie
Westfalia '86
