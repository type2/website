Subject: Gauges with idiot lights
Date: Fri, 22 Mar 1996 09:17:17 -0600 (CST)

I came across this is in Hot Rod magazine and thought I would pass it 
along.  This company is selling gauges that have an idiot light built 
into them.  They are for marine applications but appear to work in 
cars.  I don't know what their compatibility with vw's is.  The 
selling point is you only need one sender to run the thing.  They 
offer water temp, oil temp, oil pressure and fuel level.  Guages are 
by Gaffrig.
