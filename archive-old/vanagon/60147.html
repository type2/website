My wife and I will be spending a short time in Fairbanks and Anchorage as
we do the &quot;standard&quot; tour. We'll be in Fairbanks Sunday evening and
Anchorage on Wednesday for a couple of days.

We'd appreciate any hints on really good places to go, things to see and,
most important, places to eat off the beaten path.

If it works, I'd like to hoist a few to Gerry and the list with any of you
up there.
