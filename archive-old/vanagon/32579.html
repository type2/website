&gt;Well.  Actually, I was thinking about how we needed a group campsong
&gt;(Joel, any burning lyrics?  :), but will put that on the back burner
&gt;to address this current thing.  How about holding up 2 fingers (like a
&gt;peace sign) in the right hand, and 3 fingers in the left?  To the onlooker,
&gt;this would make a &quot;V-W&quot; sign.  Might be hard to see while both are
&gt;driving, however, especially if there's any tintled glass involved.

I can see it now:

&quot;...Dateline NBC.  We're reporting an unexplained vehicle accident phenomena.
 There seems to be a dramatic increase in the number of head-on accidents
invloving 2 VW vans.  There have been reports by some witnesses that for some
unexplained reason, one or both of the drivers takes both his hands off the
steering wheel...We'll continue this investigation and  have a full report on
next week's program.&quot;
