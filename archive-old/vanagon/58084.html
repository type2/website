&gt; 
&gt;   I MUST have missed something?  Who's John Anderson?  Why is he mad at
Ron?
&gt; If there's a competion problem, then I don't understand.
&gt; 
&gt;  I have a On-line service offering VW parts at reasonable prices, SO.  I
&gt; sell many different types of VW parts, ie Vanagon, Jetta etc.  I don't
&gt; understand the problem with different people offering these types of
&gt; services?  I do understand the people that don't like the use of &quot;The
List&quot;
&gt; for advertising.  I post a few items to the list, I also post to the
&gt; Water-cooled autos list too.  If I have something to offer the &quot;List
&gt; Members&quot;  I post it.  The &quot;list&quot; is a tool that some should think about,
5-6
&gt; Years ago if you needed Headgaskets for your Vanagon, Where would you
have
&gt; looked?  Yes, some of us have had Vanagons for many years.
&gt; 
&gt;   Some of us have more than our share of Knowledge on these vehicles too.
&gt; I've not been posting a whole lot to the list for many different reasons,
&gt; Personal stuff happening on my end (that's a diffent story, non VW
related).
&gt; List members &quot;Lashing out&quot; at other people keeps some from posting too.
&gt; 
&gt;   If I know something about the topic being asked or a problem being
asked,
&gt; I often DON'T post due to the &quot;Fear Factor&quot; of someone else responding
that
&gt; they know more or, that what I may have posted is wrong ETC. As the
thread
&gt; about NOT posting if you don't know the info. 
&gt; 
&gt;   There are so many people on this list that know a great amount of info
on
&gt; Vanagons, also a number of people that have other backrounds that apply
too.
&gt; I'm a VW person, my family has owned VW's since the day I was born
5-4-65.
&gt; I was working on our 69 Bus when I was 12. I've worked in a VW only
repair
&gt; shop for the last 7 years.  I deal with ALL the different problems that
VW's
&gt; have EVERY day! I drive more VW's in a week than some have seen in their
&gt; lifetime.
&gt; 
&gt;   I'm not a Parts Person, I'm a Tech and a VW Owner. I run the
&gt; Volks-motorsports business as a &quot;Source&quot; of VW parts to people that DON'T
&gt; have the &quot;Luxury&quot; that I have of a large inventory of VW parts. 
&gt; 
&gt;   I love the Vanagon list, it's one of the best things I've found on the
&gt; internet!  Let's all remember that some know more than others, some ask
the
&gt; same questions asked Many times before, But didn't you ask that same
&gt; question at some time?
