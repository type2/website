Episode I, The First.

In our previous episode, the gaunt features of the group reflected the
seriousness of the journey which lay before them ... either that, or the
beer had been REALLY flat last night. Richard Palmer, of T-shirt and
List Sticker fame, and an as yet undetermined band of co-conspirators,
was supposed to have left North Carolina sometime last week. They were
heading in the general direction of Chattanooga, TN, and from there, by
way of Possumtown (alias Tookalooka, Amabala), to Graceland in Memphis, TN,
home of the Profit of Rock and Roll, Elvis the Pelvis.

well, they was supposed to be here in Tookalooka this afternoon. no show.
tonight at 2100 (9:00pm to you civies), i get a call: they are semi-broken
down or had been or will be in 'Nooga. but they hope to be here tomorrow
afternoon. right now, they are looking for a place to crash. i suggested
DeSoto State Park, about 30 miles inside Alabama. we'll find out tomorrow
if that was a good suggestion or merely a detour into Redneck Hell.

Stay Tuned, as the Worm Turns. :)
