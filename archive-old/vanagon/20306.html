#4 on the four speed is a direct drive, ie. the differential is 
going the same RPMs as the flywheel.  
#4 on the 5 speed (for all the trannys I've ever seen) is also 
a direct drive, and 5 is overdrive, ie the diff is going at more
RPMs than the flywheel.  I don't even want to begin on those
silly Corvettes with 7 speeds.
