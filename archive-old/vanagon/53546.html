&gt; &gt; Todd-
&gt; &gt;         I was wondering how you got a hold of that VW mechanics manual and
&gt; &gt; if you knew of anyway I could get one without somehow getting a job at the
&gt; &gt; local VW dealer... Thanks
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Hi Dave and all
&gt; This message was sent to me personally but I had several requests for
&gt; this information so I thought I would share it with the list.  The title
&gt; of the manual on the front page is &quot;1986 Vanagon and Vanagon Syncro&quot;
&gt; then on the bottom of the front page it says
&gt; &quot;service training&quot;  The part number is WSP 521 133 00. Volkswagen of
&gt; United States, Inc.         I was thinking about formating the manual
&gt; and putting it in the archives but the &quot;all
&gt; rights reserved&quot; warning is written fairly strongly on the inside cover.
&gt; It does say however &quot; without the prior written permission of the
&gt; publisher&quot;  So if someone wants to contact VW and get permission to put
&gt; this in the archives I would be glad to. Sounds like a tall project. It
&gt; would be a good thing to have in tha archives though. It has cut away
&gt; pictures of the Viscous coupling and the best description of how it
&gt; works that I have read. It also has engine info and even  info on
&gt; accessories like power mirrors and power locks. There are a couple of
&gt; pages of pictures of special tools also. Todd
