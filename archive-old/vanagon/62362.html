Subject: Westfalia A/C Idea

     Folks-
     
     Forever bemused by VW's inability or unwillingness to do something 
     about front A/C in the Westfalia (just CAN'T use that cutsey name), 
     I've been wondering:
     
     How about sacrificing that left side &quot;shelf&quot; and installing a blank 
     duct (similar to the one over the sliding door, but without the 
     vents). At the rear, the duct would have a fitting to go into (and 
     replace) the leftmost air director on the A/C unit.  At the front, it 
     could terminate in an air director or two.  Or a more involved 
     installation might include ductwork that you install above the ceiling 
     panel with a couple of vents to bring the air away from the back of 
     your neck.  Maybe even an inline fan to help the air get through the 
     tube.
     
     Anyone done something like this on their own?
     
     Should I try it and then sell you all copies?
     
     -Blaine
