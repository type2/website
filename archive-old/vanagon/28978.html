Subject: Re: How I got home from work (broken clutch cable)

Why stop to fix it at all?  When this happens to me, I just drive it home
and fix it there.  You just gotta (look both ways first) put the bus in
first gear, turn the starter over until the bus starts and give it some gas.
You just gotta get the revs of the engine just right (so that the rpms of
the engine match the rpms of the tranny?) before you make a decisive shift
into second and so on.  When you get good enough at it, the gears hardly
grind at all..
