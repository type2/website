Thanks for the several suggestions.  Upon rechecking the brake system, I
found a slight leak from the rear brake cylinder(passenger side).  I
replaced both rear brake cylinders &amp; now the brakes work as they were
intended to do.

&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;What would cause 'low brake pedal'?
&gt;
&gt;I just got new rear drums &amp; brake shoes.  I've checked the brake fluid
&gt;resevoir &amp; it's at max.  I don't see anything leaking from under.  It seems I
&gt;have to pump the brake pedal to get the 'normal feel' of braking.  Any
&gt;thoughts would be appreciated.
