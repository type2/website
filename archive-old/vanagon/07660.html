Subject: Uh Oh!

Bad news folks... well not for any of you.

On the way to night school last night, In the school driveway,
I smashed the van...
Arrrgh!
The worst part is, because it's the front of my van...
People (insurance people) will assume it's my fault.

I hate morons, I hate morons, I hate morons.

I'm not in the mood to have to deal with this shit right now.

I'll give details later.


Cheers
