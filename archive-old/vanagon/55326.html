&gt; I am having an hydraulic lifter sticking on the 87GL once a month or so.
&gt; I usually does this when cold but will also when started hot. It does it
&gt; when cold and had not done it when last turned off, and vice versa when
&gt; turned off hot (read warm) and started warm. The guy I bought it from
&gt; said it did it ocassionally, but did not until lately, and only very
&gt; intermittently. I use synthetic oil w/Prolong and added a little Marvel
&gt; Mystery on the last episode and it did help. Any ideas? Can this lifter
&gt; damage anything while in the &quot;sticky&quot; mode and tapping around. Otherwise
&gt; the Vanagon runs excellent. Any and all ideas and comments appreciated.

Hi: Could it be that a lifter is draining oil out overnight and needs to
be pumped back up when restarted? I think mine does that sometimes. The
horizontal design helps to promote that.
