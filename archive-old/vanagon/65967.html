Subject:      Battery, OXS lights stay on after start

Hey ya'll, can someone help me on *this* one too?

When I start the van -hot or cold- the battery and OXS dummy lights stay on
until I blip the gas once. If you turn on the lights, etc. before giving it some
gas the lights stay dim until you do at which time everything brightens up.

This started about 3 years ago followed shortly by alternator failure. I figured
it was just the bad alternator but it continued with my new alternator to this
day. Nobody has been able to explain this phenom.

Its irritating as you cannot just reach into the van on hot days and start it
before loading the kids, wife in. I have to get in to pop the accelerator once.
Once, my wife went out to the car with my daughter while I stood in the grocery
check-out line. She started the van, turned on the A/C,  and sat in back. The
van stalled after a few minutes with a flat dead battery. The van had been
running off the battery till all charge was gone.

Any ideas?
