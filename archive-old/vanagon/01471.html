Subject: hydraulic valve lifters?

Will somebody explain to me about hydraulic valve lifters?  What their function
is, and how they achieve it?  What their relation to oil pressure is?  And what 
it means for one to collapse?  (That's what I've got, collapsed valve 
lifters.  I don't know how that compares with fallen arches...)  I've got
the Bentley manual, so you can refer to pages in there.

At this point my understanding is that their only purpose is a cushioning
effect.

Thanks in advance; I'd really appreciate a lesson.
