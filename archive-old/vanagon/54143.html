&gt; Question: Can anyone provide information on the potential problems of or
&gt;            procedures required to bring the Westy into the states?
&gt;  
&gt;            Of course, I can go get it and drive it back - but its all the
&gt;            legal stuff that I don't know about. Who should I contact and
&gt;            what do I need to provide/do to make this possible?

I looked into the possibility of importing a dual cab Syncro a few years ago.
 I called the U.S. Customs office and spoke with a woman there that was
suprisingly very helpfull and pleasant.  She sent me some information about
importing things into the states including vehicles.  Expect the following
(from what I remember):

1. You'll need to pay the US Customs a 2.5% (two point five) duty on
passenger vehicles (trucks like the dual or single cabs are 25% (yes, twenty
five percent).

2. Make sure the vehicle has stickers on it that say that it complies with US
EPA and DOT requirements.  The Canadian vehicles I've seen have this, but be
sure to check.

3. Expect that you'll be asked to change a couple of things like the
speedometer to read in MPH instead of KPH, and possibly lower wattage
headlight bulbs that meet outdated US standards.

4. Depending on your state, you'll have registration and smog laws to contend
with, so check with you state's DMV to see what their requirements are for
&quot;out of state&quot; or imported vehicles.

Good luck,
