The Campmobile owners guide that I got from the previous
owner does not have any mention of how to tell how much propane
you have left.  I don't see anything that looks like a guage
anywhere near the tank.  Is there some way to tell how much
you have or do you just stop at a propane station every so often
and have them fill it up.

A related question.  Assuming that the temperature is in the
70-80 range,  how many days can you run the refrig on a tank
of propane.  I know there are lots of variables, but just a
ball park number is fine ( &lt; 2 days, about a week, ...)
