Subject: 83 water boxer



I have owned this '83 Vanagon L since new.
I plan to sell it at a reasonale price or
it will be donated.

It has 128K miles with new radiator, water
pump, and cooling system hoses. It is manual
with good exterior.

But, it starts showing signs of age with
overheating sometimes. Looking at my busy
schedule at work, I am certain not to have
time to do more to this vehicle. However, it has
been a very faithful companion with me, from 
Vancouver to Baja, Mexico, from San Francisco
to the Rockey Mountain. 

The vehicle is in Cupertino, California.

Regards,
James
