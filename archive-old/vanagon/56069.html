&gt; I tried scrubbing mind, but after several hours, there are still some black

 Ron,  

Soak 'em overnight or more in Simple Green, then it'll just rinse off. 
It won't work unless you really let them soak though, but if you got the
time it's worth it.  I've used this stuff on plastics with good results.
