&gt; 
&gt; Paul's statements might be true regarding the US market and Westies...
&gt; and his sales person probably doesn't know his ass from a hole in the
&gt; ground about European models (hell....he was probably selling washing
&gt; machines last year..), buy I have in front of me the latest EV
&gt; catalogues from the Fatherland...and lo and behold...Westphalia versions..
 
Where (and how) did you get that catalogue? I would love to get a
copy...
