Subject: FUKENGRUVEN!

My '80 Westy had this &quot;Fukengruven&quot; bumper sticker - just like the
Fahrvergnugen slogan, complete with the stick figure, on the pop-top when I
bought it last year.  As my 5 year old daughter began to learn to read, i
took it off!  Now that she's a worldly 6-year old, i wish still had it. Can
anyone out there tell me where to find one, or does anyone have an extra to
sell?
