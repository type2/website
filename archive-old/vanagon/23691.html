          hey all,  i seem to have been cursed with the &quot;mark janello&quot;
          syndrome (no offense to you, mark, but it seemes fitting to
          name it after your trials).  i began taking my old doors off
          the '66 kombi in order to replace them.  the very first
          door screw that i removed revealed a loose plate behind the
          hinge and it almost fell down into the body, as mark
          described earlier this month.  this plate sits behind the
          actual door hinge and is threaded so that the screws pull it
          and the door hinge tightly together.  there is no place to
          get a grip on this plate except through an empty screw hole.
          i managed to put a piece of mechanics wire through one empty
          hole and hold the plate from falling but this prevented the
          hinge from being able to come out and off.  there is no room
          between the hinge and plate or behind the plate.  well,
          maybe 1/32&quot;.  i thought about adhering the plate and hinge
          together with something sticky but i don't think they will
          exit the slot in the body as one piece.  any ideas,
          suggestions?  it appears these were never meant to be messed
          with or else i'm missing the terribly obvious.  HELP!  mark,
          dave, rusty, kevin, bob, someone?????

          BTW - visited kevin at &quot;el rancho FULL LOT&quot; sunday.  had a
          great visit and got first hand looks at those wacky vehicles
          he has written about.  hope to see many of you at the &quot;love
          bug fest&quot; coming up in n.central fla.  maybe i'll have my
          new doors on?!
