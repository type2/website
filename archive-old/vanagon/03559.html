Subject: Rev Limiter Problems

I am posting to this list because some of you have vanagons w/rev-limiters
or have 911 motors in them with rev-limiters.

This morning, my 72 911 wouldn't start.  It had never, ever failed to start,
and all of a sudden its dead.  After some swearing and tinkering, I found that
the rev-limiting rotot was broken - s chunk broke right off the end of it, 
where the contact-on-a-spring make the connection.  This left me with 
rev-limiting at 0 RPM/UPM.  

I'll admit, I did wind it up a little last night on my way home from school,
but this is ridiculous.  It is a genuine Bosch rotor, about 2 years old or
so...

Just something to file in your mental archives...
