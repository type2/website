&gt;its got dual Kadrons on a 1776cc motor.  The carbs need a rebuild and to

Tried cleaning and synching them already?  Tuned up?  Still no good?

If you do it yourself, you'll know how to fix it if anything should go wrong.
You and your VW will draw closer and you'll have more confidence in your
ability to keep your van running.  The $180 bucks in your pocket is a nice
thought, too.  

Try the Official Service Manual from Bentley - about $35.00

&quot;How To Keep Your Volkswagen Alive&quot; By: John Muir is another good
resource for any air-cooled VW.  Generic and common sense approach.
