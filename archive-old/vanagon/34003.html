Subject: Re: Brake job (1962) - STILL!!!

i think muir was thinking of the later brake set up when he wrote that.  (he
didnt mention rubber hoses, either, but they are there and should be checked)
 That s  where my system failed.

Id get those springs with a flat head screw driver.  Get it under where the
spring goes into the shoes,  and push the end og the hook back till it pulls
through the shoes and you're free!  I hope i explained it well enough.  

taking cylindeer off doesnt help
