&gt;is -- are there any recommended aftermarket sources for VW exhaust systems?

I got an exhaust system for my 75 bus from the Bus Boys, but I'm not sure if
they have vanagon parts. It was cheap, $105 for the whole thing, which
bolts on right to the heater boxes. Hence no need for a J-tube, elbow,
muffler, tail pipe, lots of gaskets, etc... Installation was simple, the
only annoying thing was that it was painted with non heat resistant paint
and so I had to live with this awfull smell of melting polymers for a
while. It seems that now, all of that paint burned away.

You may also want to try Rocky Mountain Motor Works. I have 1 or 2 more
addresses at home and will send them to you when I get there.

Spaeter,
