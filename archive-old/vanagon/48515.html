Subject: 60,000 volt coil?

Feel like something *shocking* tonight? What if I use the Pertronix Ignitor
(instead of points) and a 60,000 volt coil? Will I have problems with the
(stock) solid core Bosch plug wires? I'm not trying to be cheap by not replacing
the wires, but I just want to know what to get. Sounds like a great ignition
system, but I'm not looking foreward to getting the pis* shocked out of me every
time I try to tune up the engine. I've worked on a few with the GM H.E.I. They
flat out tell you in the shop manual that it's enough to kill you. I think it's
upwards of 80Kv, tho. 

All suggestions welcome. I like salt.
