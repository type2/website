hi there everyone,
	
	ok, i need help in a little diagnosis.  Amelia just called and
there's some funny noise coming from one of the wheels.  it is a sort
of a rythmic flap/clank combo noise, that seems to speed up as the car
does.  this leads us to believe it has something to do with the wheel.
(i know what you're saying, what brilliant people thsese two are:)
anyway, i  haven't seen it yet, but will either spending an hour or
the entire threeday weekend (three days for me at least) trying to fix
it, so wanted to get some possible ideas from all you nice folks.  she
says it reminds her of a noise a friends car made with a bad CV joint.
anyway, i asked her to crawl under and take a look, but as far as she
can get in and see no rip on the little rubber boot there.  (but her
belly is getting a little bigger these days (remember the poppa thing:)
and couldn't get all the way under).  so, any ideas of things i should
look for?  or how to go about looking?  anything as always is totaly
appreciated!  

take care everyone!!
