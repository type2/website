&gt;Just a quick question to all fellow Vanagonowners.

&quot;Vanagonowners&quot;  It's just the name I've been searching for!  : )

&gt;Is there a special way to
&gt;get the sparkplug wires off?

I've made a little tool out of thick (like 1/8&quot;, way thicker than a coat
hanger) wire that's shaped a little like a 'C'.  One end is the handle that I
pull on and the other end goes into the little hole in the metal boot shield.
 I'll attempt to draw (please don't laugh):

    xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx     &lt;---handle end

    xxxxxx    &lt; -----this end sticks into the hole in the shield.

I just stick it in, pull on it and off she comes!
