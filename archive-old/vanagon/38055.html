Subject: redline waterwetter

Hi all,
        I've recently received some company propaganda from Redline and
included was a product they call water wetter. They claim that it improves
cooling efficiency of in place systems so naturally being a wasserboxer
gambler I was keenly interested. Any thoughts and or opinions from the List?
By the way I recently replaced the gearbox fluids in my syncro (front and
back) with their MTL fluid and I feel a definite smoothing in my shifting.
