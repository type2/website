Subject: Transplant: Diesel Bellhousing Question

     Late last night, I was going through my Audi Bentley (three volumes
     the size of the one Vanagon volume!) looking for numbers of desirable
     tools...

     I happened upon a small diagram of the engine bell-housing flange for
     the 5cyl non-turbo engine, the one that makes good sense for a
     transplant. What caught my attention is that it is an eight bolt
     affair. Returning to my Vanagon Bentley, I could find no
     similar diagram for the various bellhousings used, but from the
     pictures it seems that they use four bolts to hold things
     together.

     Can anyone with a Diesel who has had the engine out confirm this?
     The Transplant Task Force has heard a rumor that the Diesel
     bellhousings will directly mate with the VAG 5Cyl engines, but my
     observations would make that seem unlikely.
