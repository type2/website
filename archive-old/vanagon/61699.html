&gt;&gt;My 85 Westy is running very rich.  Symptoms are black smoke, poor gas
&gt;&gt;mileage and lack of power.
&gt;&gt;The following parts were checked by replacing with a known good part
&gt;&gt;fuel injectors (mine weep a little, but not serious)
&gt;&gt;coolant temperature sensor
&gt;&gt;ECU
&gt;&gt;Air Flow sensor
&gt;&gt;Oxygen Sensor
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The fuel pressure is OK (30lbs).
&gt;&gt;Fuel pressure regulator is OK.
&gt;&gt;Timing &amp; advance is OK.
&gt;&gt;cylinder pressure is relatively OK (125 psi on 1&amp;3, 150 on 2&amp;4).

&gt;&gt;&gt;I had the same thing with my 85 westy turned out to be a bad wire 
&gt;going=
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;from the o2 sensor to fuel injection computer. The wire is coax and 
&gt;was=
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;kinked by something in the harness, giving the computer the full 
&gt;lean
&gt;&gt;&gt;signal, so the computer responds with full rich.
&gt;&gt;&gt;good luck

&gt;=46rom the O2 sensor to where it connects to the wire harness is a 
&gt;single=
&gt;
&gt;wire (no coax).  From the connector to the ecu it is coax.  The shield 
&gt;is=
&gt;
&gt;connected to pin 6, a wire from the air flow sensor.  I found the 
&gt;center
&gt;conductor of the coax is shorted (intermittently) to the shield.  Are 
&gt;you=
&gt;
&gt;saying this is NOT OK?
&gt;Thanks

Not ok, should not be shorted to the shield at any time!!
