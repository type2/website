Subject: out of sight

Have you ever wanted to cover the cargo area in the back of your
Westphalia,  above the mattress? I get uncomfortable when I park with
something valuable sitting out in the open. I have the rear heater so under
the seat storage is limited.

My wife Ingrid and I just built an inexpensive, light cover. It's no
protection if the car is broken into but, &quot;Out of sight, out of mind.&quot; We
built a square cover frame and legs out of PVC plumbing pipe. Ingrid found
a piece of fabric very close to the seat cover. That covered the top.

Think of a square trampolene or card table shape, made out of PVC pipe with
a fabric top. A tube compartment is stiched into each side of the cloth.
The PVC pipe is threaded into the edges of the cloth and connected with
corner brackets. The contraption straddles the matress, making a large
hidden storage area.

If you make one, connect the legs to the outer frame ring with &quot;T&quot;
fixtures. The cross of the &quot;T&quot; becomes part of the square frame ring. The
leg become the vertical part of the &quot;T.&quot; The legs will hinge to make a flat
unit for storage.
&quot;
You will need two ten foot lengths of pipe, four corner or &quot;L&quot; brackets,
four &quot;T &quot;joints, four end caps (feet for the legs.) I used 3/4 inch pipe.
If you havent worked with PVC pipe, you will find it easy. It cuts easily
with any kind of saw. It assembles just by pushing parts together.
Everything holds together by friction.
