&gt; &gt; I really hope Tim just got a Lemon.
&gt; 
&gt; Holy Moley, Mother of Cripes!  I hope NOT! 8^)
&gt; 

Just to clarify, I just hope your van is an isolated case.

Because, there is NO way I could afford what you are having to go through.
I've only had my van 6 months and so far repairs include:

1. 2 Radiator Resistors and loose heat shield. $100.00
2. Power Steering boot. $10.00 part, $120 labor.

&gt; LOT of these guys!), said the VR6 engine has one head over both banks of
&gt; cylinders, even though they're in a V pattern??  Is this physically
&gt; possible?  [Since I'm into antique cars, I've seen a lot of strange
&gt; configurations, but never anything quite like that!]. 

Yes, this V6 only has one head.  It is a very narrow V, I think its 60 
degrees versus the standard 90.

&gt; Is the EV VR-6 really coming out??? Maybe I'll swap for one after 
&gt; 

Who knows, I'm about ready to give up.  If they do, and you can afford 
it, go get one and we can all user your GL for parts.  

Heck, have you thought about disassembling it and selling the parts.
I bet you could double your original investment. :)
