Subject: 4 Sale! A little something for everyone



Citizens:

Seeing as how I purchased my bus as a result of a posting to this list, I
figured I'd return the Karma.  Fresh from today's Austin American
Statesman, a little something for everyone:

&quot;1958 Blue Panel van, New trans., runs and looks good. Liscensed.
Inspected.  $1700  Chuck _at_ (512) 835.6054&quot;


&quot;*'66 Micro Complete*   *'71 Camper complete*   $800 for both/OBO   (512)
453.5015&quot;


&quot;'89 VW Vanagon,  Runs perfectly, Good condition.  One owner.  AC needs
work.  $5200  OBO  (512) 708.8796&quot;


I know nothing about these vehicles other than what you see here.

***Caveat Emptor***

Regards,

Peter.
