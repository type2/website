Subject:      Re: Syncro experiences?

FROM: H YATES

Hi there.  Sorry, I have lost track of the originator of this subject.  I
have a '90 Syncro Westy, and love it.  We had a Toyota Land Cruiser, and
then a Jeep Cherokee, and the Syncro goes wherever those other two vehcicles
went.  We've even had it mired in mud up to the body, and got out using the
differential lock all by ourselves.  The Cherokee, and Cruiser would have
had to be towed out (diagonal wheel spin).

It is an extremely comfortable vehicle to drive, and we are very pleased with
the vehicle.  It has gone across Canada three times, and we have used the
4wd capabilities many times.

Our van gets around 24 mpg (imperial) on the highway, with or without the
a/c on.  We don't use it around town, so can't help you with mileage there.
The Syncro is very heavy.. put it on the scales loaded at 5250 lbs.  Tires
are critiical to this beast.. most tires don't have the correct load rating
for this van.  The Yokohama Y370 is an excellent choice.  As somebody did
mention, tire wear on the outsides is a problem due to the full time system,
but keeping good alignment, and tire pressures are important.

The system works 97% rear, 3% front all the time.  It transfers power to the
front as needed.  ie. if the rear slips 10%, it puts 10% more to the front.
This will go to a max of 3% rear, 97% front power distribution.

The van handles extremely well with this power transfer.  Snow/ice travel
is unbelievable, and any slick terraint for that matter.  The Syncro also
comes with a bull low first gear ( a 5 speed transmission ).  The loweset
 gear will enable the van climb almost anything.

The Syncro has a second frame added to it, which encloses the drive shaft
and engine area with steel.  Most components are hidden way up in the frame,
with the engine being the lowest point in the rear.  The shocks are gas
filled (not oil like the 2wd vans), and they hold up extremely well.

I have 111,000 km on our van now, and it hasn't needed any repair except a
waterpump I blew in September (under warranty!).  Parts... they ARE expensive.
The air filter is special .. $134.00 up here (cdn).  Front brake rotors are
$300.00 each (still on original brakes, thank God!).  I guess it is the
compromise you take to own this vehicle.  It is extremely well equipped to
adapt to almost any terrain (it's built to military specs), and with the
limited production run, the parts are exclusive to VW.  The key to these
vehicles is regular maintenance.  We haven't had any problems with the
mechanicals at all on our van (except noted waterpump).  A good VW
dealer is really necessary to get good maintenance.  I'm lucky in this
department.

If you require any more answers, please fire away.

Thx.
Harry
