Hello everyone,

No, I have not bought a van yet. Yes, I am still looking.=20

I have found a fairly nice, low mileage EV GL at a local (non-VW) =
dealer. Their window price is $18k, the &quot;sale&quot; price in the paper was =
$16k, and the Edmunds value is about $4k less than that. It has an =
automatic transmission, the convenience package (power windows, locks, =
cruise control) as well as ABS.=20

Since I've only bought two cars in my lifetime, both new, I'd like to =
pose a few questions to list members who have more experience with this:

1. How much above or below retail book value did you end up paying?=20
2. Which is more relevant, Kelley's or Edmunds?
3. When those books give the value to the options and accessories, are =
those the retail value or the trade in value?
4. When buying a VW from a non-VW dealer, are they more motivated to get =
the van off their lot?=20
4a. Is that dealer likely to low ball a trade in when it's not his =
brand?

Any other tips, hints, or anecdotes would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Matt Dekker
