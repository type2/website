&gt;Today's paper says VW is reducing its white collar work force by 43% by

&gt;What are the chances of a 134 kit when the engineers are about to be &gt;fired!

You never know, A/C might be a big consideration for Europeans....
(HA!  yeah, right!!)

OK, the following is a gross generalization, but after having had some A/C work
done recently, the person who did the work said:
1)  *Most* auto A/C systems work the same way w/ similar components.
2)  Conversion to R-134 would retain much of the original components with
changes to the sealing rings and, of course, the refrigerant itself.

With the technical knowledge available on this list, why wouldn't it be
possible to take an existing *generic* R-134 conversion kit (or one for
a non-VW, at any rate) and then adapt it to the A/C systems you all have?
Yeah, I know about time &amp; money, but if you want it bad enough....
(besides, I don't think you can skirt the time and money part, anyway.)
