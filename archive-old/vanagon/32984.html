Subject: Interesting Westie FS

Here's an interesting 'for sale' from the local paper;

Mercedes 207D (Westfalia camper), 1984, 5 Spd., 40K Kms, 7 pass, 
sleeps 4 adults, exc. cond.  Never winter driven, very rare. $42,900 
neg.  (514)-533-5535

Now I wonder, did Westfalia convert this like a standard VW 
Westfalia?  Has anyone seem one of these things?
