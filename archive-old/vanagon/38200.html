Subject: Re:Spotted EV Camper in Key West

&gt;
&gt;When I was camping inthe Keys I saw a white EV Camper.  it had all of the
&gt;exterior hookups and had a real nice gray granite looking cabnit, sink,etc.
&gt;Does anyone know if they are going to produce any more EV Westfalias.  I am
&gt;thinking about either selling my 89 Westy or trading it in on a new one
&gt;later on.

Another one hooked - time to start reeling him in!
That sir, was no Westfalia, that was a Euro'bago!

(obviously its getting late)
