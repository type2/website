Subject: Standard/ automatic Vanagon ratio?

Hi folks

I am wondering if there was a year after which the headgasket problem was no 
longer a problem. Did VW ever fix this in any year.  Also I understand it is 
more likely to find a standard Vanagon than an automatic one, is the ratio 2 to 
1 or better does anyone know?

I have aonly subscribed to this group for about a week now, but already I have 
learned an awful lot. Thanks everyone.!!
