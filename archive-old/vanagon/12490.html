Subject: Blue goo question

&gt;I think I've been hosed by my mechanic.  I bought some phosphate free
&gt;anti-freeze from the VW dealer (3 gallons) with the intention of
&gt;flushing and replacing my fluid.  I was too busy and was having other work
&gt;done so I asked my mechanic to do it.  I got the car back and the stuff
&gt;in the overflow tank looks pretty green to me -- just like the typical
&gt;anti-freeze.
&gt;
&gt;I never opened the VW anti-freeze but have heard from you all that its
&gt;blue.  Is it really noticeably blue?  This stuff looks very very green.
&gt;Did I get ripped off?  Could I be mistaken?  Thanks for any help.  Please

I forgot to add that I left the VW anti-freeze in the Van for him to
use and the three containers were not there when I picked it up (I did an
after-hours pick up).  So, presumably, the stuff went into *my* van and
not somewhere else.
