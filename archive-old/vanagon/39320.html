I emptied a few tanks and gently hit it with a rubber malet to get the 
rust out.  Then I took an old speaker magnet and put on the bottom away 
from the fuel exit tube to collect any future loose rust.  i never had 
any problems after that, and as far as I know neither has the new owner.  
This was 3-4 yrs ago.
