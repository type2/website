Subject: Outdoor Foldup table for Westy ?

Hello all,

Since we've found this really nice *private* spot where two streams 
flow together, we've really been having a great time in our Westy 
(even more than before that is). Problem is, I like having a table to 
cook up meals on, wash dishes outside, etc, etc. 
So the last few weekends out I've been planning in my head a square 
table with folding legs to lie flat in the rear of the bus. I've 
pondered several ideas for compact yet sturdy folding legs, until I 
thought, geez someone *must* have done this already...

So... anyone built the ultimate folding outdoor table for their bus 
and would care to share some ideas?

(I was thinking 3/4&quot; plywood (since I have lots) with an 1x2 edging 
(lots free around here..) for the top, and 1x2 or 1x4 legs, hinged, 
with some type slick quick release braces...)

ps: please cc: direct, as I'm still off list until back to school 
havoc settles...

Thanks!
