Subject: Foldable tables - comments wanted

Has anyone tried the &quot;rollable&quot; table that is sold at REI and trough
this web-server: &lt;http://www.sccsi_dot_com/Wilderness/table.html&gt;?

I've been looking for a foldable table small enough to keep in the vanagon
but large enough to use for a decent dinner table when sitting outside
the car. 

This looks like the solution, but is it sturdy enough?  How easy is it to
set up? As I am in Sweden and these tables are in the US it will cost me a
lot in shipping and other charges, so i want to make sure it's a good product.
