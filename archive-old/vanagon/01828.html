Subject: Anyone going to CVAs Lime Rock Meet this Sunday...


I guess the subject line says it all. Anyone out there going?

Its at Lime Rock Park in the NW corner of CT from 9 to 4. I'm probably
going to go...not sure if I want to take the 56 on a 400 mile 85 degree
trip...or take the EuroVan...

If anyone is thinking of going...e-mail me.

Ric
