&gt;	Would it put too much stress on the center differential
&gt;to just jack up one wheel at a time and put it in gear- the diffs
&gt;should allow the other three wheels to stay still... and with
&gt;only one turning at a time, the id of the bad one would be 100%.

DO NOT DO THIS!!!! 
THE VISCOUS COUPLING WILL TRANSMIT TORQUE THE FRONT WHEELS AND THE VAN WILL
BECOME MOBILE!  THIS WOULD BE DANGEROUS!  
DO NOT DO THIS!!!!!
