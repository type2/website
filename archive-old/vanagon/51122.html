Subject: Tire wear question...

Okay I get odd tire wear on the rear tires of the EV.  I understand 
wearing on the inside or the outside.  On both edges and down the middle BUT
what would cause diagonal banded wear?  Best I can do ASCII is below.  
Makes a Horrendous racket now with the very unsmooth tires.
