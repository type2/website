&gt;    I noticed you need new tires and were looking a Uniroyal Larado.  I

&gt; Blazers/Jimmys came stock, a few years ago, with those on it and within
&gt; a year the tread would show signs of weather cracking.  To the point
&gt; where they started to leak.  I've changed my share of Larado's.  Stay
&gt; away!

Well no wonder, the &quot;Larado&quot; sounds like one of those Chinese knock-off
brands. j/k ;)
  However, I bought some of the *real* Uniroyal Laredos and I couldn't
be happier. Almost a year of usage and no signs of &quot;weather cracking&quot; or
any other inferior quality indications. As a matter a fact they look
pretty good. Besides, mine came with the 'Road Hazzard' protection. Any
of the above symptoms would be replaced immediately by Sam's Club (the
dealer). 

The only problem is figuring out how to spend the $150 that you saved.
