Subject: Re: mpg on 87 syncro

&gt; I have an 87 syncro with 120K miles.  I am getting 15 mpg.  My question is
&gt;  -- is this normal???   Normal or not can I do something to improve it.  If
&gt; not, can I put an extra gas tank so that I don't have to stop for gas every
&gt; 200 miles.  Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Here is a data point for your question:
86 syncro, 120k miles, 37k on complete engine rebuild with new heads,
all new FI sensors and injectors.

Avg mileage: 17mpg, highest: 22mpg, lowest: 15mpg.
