&gt;Subject: Hearses? fwd from usenet

&gt;&gt; I was wondering if VW ever customized its early Transporters as hearses.
&gt;&gt; I've never seen a hearse version. It seems strange that this is missing
&gt;&gt;--

&gt;I thought this was a good question and could probably be better answered
&gt;by list members.

I don't know if VW did the work, but I have seen pictures of
a split screen hearse recently.  I'm trying to remember
where I saw it.  Could have been in a recent T&amp;A, er, DB&amp;HVW
magazine or NEATO Old Bus Review.  It looked like a panel
van...elongated enough to get a casket in the back.  I'll do
some checking and post where I saw it.
