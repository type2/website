Subject: Re: The '71 single cab that isn't

        There is a place in Shelbourne, Mass., that specializes in 
        Corvair restoration and motor parts.  I cannot remember the name 
        but they advertise in VW T&amp;A regularly because they make a kit 
        that will put a Corvair engine in a Type II.  I sent for their 
        catalog and information kit a couple of years ago.  The swap 
        looked straightforward enough and included a lot of information 
        on reversing that ring.  It seemed fairly simple according to 
        their directions.
        
        I did not pursue it but I gave the catalog to my brother-in-law 
        because he fools with Corvairs the way we do Volks busses.  He 
        has an engine, several in fact, that I could use but the swap 
        does not interest me.  Yes, one of those engines is from a Spyder 
        convertible wreck that he bought for next to nothing from a local 
        wrecking yard.  If I had another bus then maybe but not in this 
        one.
        
        IAE, the place is in Shelbourne and used to be called something 
        like &quot;Otto Parts&quot; or some such name.  Check the magazine for the 
        ad.
