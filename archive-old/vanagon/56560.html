sure
 &gt;it's an Eberspacher??
 
 &gt;Yes, I can READ. Amazing, how those letters work.
 You need to get around more.

I need to get around more??
seriously, the gas heaters ARE rare on the US wasserboxers.
The reason I asked if your van was a Canadian model was that usually all
Canadian syncro's had gas heaters (Webasto BBW46 w/ digital readout on dash),
and the Eberspacher gas heaters were a popular option on the regular Canadian
vans too.. 

But not here in the US.

you had mentioned that your van was previously owned by a &quot;German Gentleman&quot;
I take it that this then is a european model, not a model made for US export,
and that the &quot;German Gentleman&quot; had it shipped over here himself. If this was
the case, it would probably say &quot;Caravelle GL&quot; instead of &quot;Vanagon&quot;.

If it was an european model, it would explain the gas heater's presence on
the van, but do any of you other European listmembers that have gas htrs on
your wasserboxers have the control panel mounted in the RR quarter panel?

Jens in Denmark??? I know he has a gas heater on his '86 Caravelle GL. 

anybody else??
