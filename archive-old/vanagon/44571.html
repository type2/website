Subject: Engine (Idoit questions!)

I just learned that my Westfalia '66's engine was replaced with '71
motor(AE825182). I belive it is 1600 but I would like to know what's the
spefic CC is it also how fast can it go? 
I am bit dazed and confused about removing the engine. I know I can slide 
it out but most of the book that  I have for instance Robert Bently and 
others shows dropping the motor bottom instead sliding out? Any tips out 
there about removing motor? A guy told me it will only takes me less than 
an hour to do it and I still having a hard time to removing the last bolt 
behind the fan housing! Sheez RUST is my number one enemy of all!
