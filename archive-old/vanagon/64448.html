Subject:      Flopping mirrors - Vanagon

Hi all,

My mirrors would always collapse in over time.  I originally corrected by
tightening the nut (after taking the mirror off the van) under the mounting
bracket.  This works until it eventually pulls the bolt out of the round
ball.

After that I drilled a hole all the way through the mounting bracket in the
same axis as the original bolt.  Where the hole pops out the top of the
bracket, countersink a hole into the plastic and then use a stainless bolt
and nut to hold the mirror as tight as you want.  No problem since then,

Kerry
