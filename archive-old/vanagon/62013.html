     sounds like maybe a linkage problem; e-mail me if you might be 
     interested in a compatible used tranny.

Recently the third gear in the transmission of my 84 vanagon has started 
sticking.  It slides into gear OK although it doesn't feel as smooth as the 
other gears.  However, sometimes, at irregular intervals, it doesn't want to 
come out of gear and I have to fiddle with it in order to disengage.
     
When the engine oil seal was changed in January, the mechanic said the 
clutch was in good condition. None of the other gears are having a problem 
-----YET!
     
Does anyone have any information on this?  Can you reply by email as I am 
off the newsgroup for about another month.
