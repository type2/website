&gt;Well, my motor is going together very well, and I am at the oil cooler 
&gt;stage.  The problem is that I can not figure out which seals go where.  The 
&gt;thinner ones seem to go between the cooler and the mounting bracket, but the 
&gt;thicker ones don't really fit between the bracket and the case.  Is it 
&gt;possible that I should have all thin ones?  I think I took out all thin 
&gt;ones, and the mounting bracket sits flush on the case.  The other 
&gt;possibility is that there are spacers which are MIA and this would account 
&gt;for the thicker seals.

The standard seal kit (from sabo?) has 2 sets of oil cooler seals, for
the two sizes of oil cooler openings.  But if you have a doghouse cooler,
then you need two more of the small ones (7mm).
