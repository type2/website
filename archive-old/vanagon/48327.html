I've got a brake bleeder with a one way valve, it is cheap and DOES 
make solo bleeding a lot easier.  It's just a check valve in a 
plastic tube.  Got it at a local 'merican car parts place.  Still need 
to run the end of the tube into a jar of fluid to prevent uptake of 
air into the line (fluid being heavier than air will open the valve, 
allowing air to travel up the line)

&gt; brake fluid.  I've heard of kits which have a one way check valve to prevent the
&gt; sucking up of dirty brake fluid.  Such a kit might be worth the trouble and
&gt; money.
