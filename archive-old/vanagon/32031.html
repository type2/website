Subject: Re: VW Splittie Ads

&gt;ADdicts:
&gt; 
&gt;Here in my office I have the following ads for splitties
&gt;framed and hanging on the wall:
&gt; 
&gt;* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
&gt; 
&gt;Picture:  66ish red/white Deluxe wrapped in a big red ribbon
&gt;with a bow on top.
&gt; 
&gt;Caption:  It comes in its own box.
&gt; 
&gt;* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
&gt; 
&gt;Picture: Red/white Deluxe with the side doors and sunroof
&gt;open.
&gt; 
&gt;Caption:  Do you have the right kind of wife for it?
&gt; 
&gt;* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
&gt; 
&gt;Picture:  Blueprint-like sketch of side view of basic
&gt;splittie body.
&gt; 
&gt;Caption:  We started with a simple plan.
&gt; 
&gt;* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
&gt; 
&gt;Picture: Street scene of identical suburban houses, each
&gt;with a red/white Deluxe parked out front (20 or so)
&gt; 
&gt;Caption: If the world looked like this....
&gt; 
&gt;* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
&gt; 
&gt;Picture: Red/white Deluxe, sunroof and cargo doors open,
&gt;with an elephant standing in the cargo area.
&gt; 
&gt;Caption:  You never know when you'll have to take an
&gt;elephant someplace.
&gt; 
&gt;* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
&gt; 
&gt;And my personal FAVORITE:
&gt; 
&gt;Picture:  Side shot of 1961 red panel van.
&gt; 
&gt;Caption:  THIS IS THE SHAPE OF TRUCKS TO COME
&gt; 
&gt;* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
&gt; 
&gt;Don't tell me, you folks want me to type in all the
text from the ads too, don't you?

jungle...The bus is in the middle of a herd of zebras, Camo painted
black and white with stripes.

Caption: It goes a lot further than the A+P

Old Life magazines are loaded with these ads.
