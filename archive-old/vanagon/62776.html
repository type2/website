Subject: '85 Westie FS Granville, Ohio, $ 950

A      Engine has blown head gasket/other unknown malady; blows off coolant
hose.
   Here's the deal: 85 Westie GL, I believe. Full Camper. Automatic.
Blaupunkt AM-FM.
   200K Miles. One owner. All Books. Air Conditioning.Tan Metallic. It's ALL
THERE!

   The Good: Interior is near perfect! I'm told everything works well;
haven't tried 'fridge, but stove works fine.(Am charging battery - took
posession this weekend). No rips or tears on seats, which show very little
wear. Cabinets in excellent shape, canvas good, all screens present. Pop-top
in VGC, roof vent (with screens in excellent shape, as well. Upolstery in
the beige herringbone style. Chassis in excellent condition - some
undercoating worn off, but otherwise looks completely solid. No evidence of
major collision repair. All accesories present, accounted for, and in
excellent shape. 

  The Bad: Seam rust on driver's side under accessory hook up area, rear
hatch slightly deformed in middle, water hook-up area shows rust bubbles,
rust around gas cap, passenger rear quarter shows parking lot dents around
wheel well. Has been sitting undriven since May. Muffler bad (but other
pipes appear solid). Tyres will need to be replaced. Rear windshield wiper
missing. Rear bumper dented; caps missing at both front and rear. Cracked
front windshield, and usual road rash on front end.      

 This is a one-owner Westie; a fellow villager, retired dentist, used it to
look at birds across the continental US. I don't know him well, but he seems
like a nice enuf guy, and claims that all worked well until the engine
started to throw coolant hoses. So he sold it to the shop that was working
on it (they rebuilt the alternator, put in new coolant hoses, other minor
stuff), and I have purchased the vehicle from them.

Before I advertise locally, I thought I'd give the list a chance to respond.
This is too nice a vehicle to chop up, IMHO, with an engine and mostly minor
stuff, someone could have a nice westie. And the interior is really top
rate! (oh yes, the front table appears to be missing, I bet the original
owner still has it at home....)
  
 Granville Ohio is about 30 miles east of Columbus, Ohio, on Interstate 70.

If interested, please contact me at 614-587-0852 between 7:00 and 9:00 p.m.
Thank you.
