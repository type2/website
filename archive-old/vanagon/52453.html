Subject: Oil Additive - OK?

I'm sure this question has come up before but I haven't seen it. Our '85 
Westy has about 110 K miles on the (2nd) engine, I am about to do an oil 
change, what are your feelings about using an oil additive such as Slick 
50 or something simular?  My mechanic says &quot;It probably woun't do any 
harm&quot;... Will it do any good?  Will it make those first cold morning 
starts any less drag on the engine? 
Thanks for input
