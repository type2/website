Subject: Re: Tire recommendations wanted

Hopefully they were the AquaTread IIs.... or you live in an area that doesn't
get much snow...

Someone recently did a test on All season tires for winter... seems the old
Aquatread came in dead last... the nice little groove fills with snow and you
ride on a 1&quot; wide &quot;tread&quot; of snow...

Redesigned Aquatread is different....
