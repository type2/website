Subject: for campers: Propane Safety


&gt;  Does anyone have any first-hand knowledge of incidents where propane
&gt;  caused a horrendous explosion?  
&gt;  
We have owned our Westy for about 8 yrs.  Had no problem with the
propane tank.  I have often wandered, though, why there are so many
burned (literally) Westfalias in the local junkyard (sorry, I forgot
I need to use the politically correct term), er, I mean, the local
parts recycling yard.

On another note, a friend of mine, who has no access to the net, called me
with a request for help today, maybe some of you folks out there can help him:

This guy owns a '74 Westfailure (sorry for the Freudian slip of the fingers)
and has decided to get a new engine in to it.  He has also agreed on
a labor-only basis (fixed price) with a local mechanic to replace the
engine.  He is apparently happy with their work.  He has so far bought the
new engine, and they have put it in for him.  He still cannot drive
the '74, since. apparently, the pipe that extends between the heat exchangers
and the exhaust(?) (the 3-4 inch pipe, the one that the optional heater
gets plugged into), is cracked due to old age.  He says he has looked for it,
but nobody carries it.
Does anybody know what he is talking about?  If not, what questions should I
ask him to clarify?

Any and all help appreciated...
Thanks,
Cetin
