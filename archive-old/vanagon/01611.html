&gt; ok. so what have we got?
&gt; 1. joints need grease.
&gt; 2. more grease is better than less grease.
&gt; 3. grease dries out. needs cleaning off and replacing.
&gt; 4. joint boots dry out and crack and get cut. need replacing eventually.
&gt; 5. flipping/reversing should extend the life of the joint for a while longer.
&gt; 6. bolts can be a bitch to get out. best to have lots of options.
&gt; 7. star-bolts is better bolts if you can get them.
&gt; 8. re-check the bolts after a while. they might loosen up.
&gt; 
&gt; did i miss anything?

The VW mechanic I take by Golf and Vanagon to strongly recommends repacking
all CV joints every 30,000 miles, especially for the Vanagon.  He claims the
joints will last almost indefinitely when maintained at this interval, 
providing a boot does not tear in the interim.
