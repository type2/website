Subject:       Wet Feet - Windshield Gasket Repair

First off, I would like to thank everyone on this list, I learned 
so much over the past year.  The list has changed me from a VW 
driver to a VW enthusiast (I now constantly scan the papers for 
busses I don't need).  At the present time my bus is in hibernation.  
I removed the windshield gasket and found two, one inch holes.  Two 
months ago there was a posting dealing with rotted frames of split 
windows.  What are my options?  It's gonna be along time before the 
salt is off the roads so I have plenty of time to do it right.
