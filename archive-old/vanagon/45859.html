Subject: Re: front suspension

Christian,
	I tried the remove the front torsion leaves and turn them  around to 
increase ground clearance procedure on my high milage '67.  I noticed no 
change at all in the front end sag.  I ended up buying some coilspring 
over shocks from Barney in Tucson.  They increased the ground clearance 
in the front by over an inch.  This is with the coil over shock set at 
its lowest adjustment notch.  I would still prefer to have new torsion 
leaves over these &quot;shocks&quot;.  Gary Gibson
