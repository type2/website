Subject:      Augusta to Seattle trip, More questions...(Attn: CA Listees!)

Here is a rough route plan, we're looking for cheap/free places to
crash/camp, mainly from Seattle to San Diego, to ??, to Augusta..

October 3rd, leave Augusta, headed for KC, one way or the other. No
specific plan yet, depends on mood. (Its a trip i've done a few times, and
i'm not worried about stopping places...)

&gt;From Kc, we'll head up I 29 to Omaha, maybe see a friend there, (Oh, No
Quarter...whatcha doing on ~monday the 6th?? We'll swing in if ya want..)

Then onto I 80, to I 84, to I 82, to I 90, to our destination outside of
Seattle..

Anyone have any advice on how the roads are this time of year? Still open?
(Mom, the ex trucker, warns of closed mountain passes..)

We'll be running KC to Seattle as non-stop as we can make it, but we will
need to sleep occasionally..

We'll spend a few days in Seattle, then begin our slow (2 weeks or
so!) trek home.

Looking at maybe taking I 5 down to Grants Pass (mike? you gonna be
home?:)

&gt;From there, hop on 101, and, avoiding LA and San Fran somehow
(suggestions?  Reasons NOT to avoid them?) head to San Diego...

Spend a day or something in San Diego, then push eastward..

&gt;From San Diego, our route is fairly uncertain...

We hope to see the Grand Canyon, and whatever else...Any suggestions?
(remember the free/cheap bit..:)

If anyone is along the planned (or unplanned!) course, and are willing to
let a listee (and 3 friends) crash in your yard, or whatever, lemme
know...:)

Or maybe you'd just like to meet me...:)

Well..thats it for now....thnaks!!

....david
