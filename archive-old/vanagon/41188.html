I'm running dual Solexes on my '74 1800. I ran a single Weber for years 
too. The duals seem to have a bit more power and I haven't experienced any 
cold weather problems. I live in a maritime climate (Seattle), but have 
driven  in sub-freezing weather. I never had any real cold-weather problems 
with the single Weber either. Have you?

If emissions compliance is important, you should try to get the engine back 
to stock condition.
