Subject: Re: Dirty Car/Wheelwell Moldings

I know the sandblasted look behing the wheelwells!!  The stock mudflap
on '86 syncros protects perhaps 5 sq in of sheet metal!

It seems that a mudflap integral with running boards would do the trick,
but I've never seen any.  I thin I would want to see a set before I spent
the $$$.  I once though about painting the lower section with the
flexible type of coating you see on some cars rocker panels, but I do
not know whaqt product would be suitable.
