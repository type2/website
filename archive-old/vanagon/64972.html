&gt; Subject: Intermittant loss of power
&gt;
&gt; I have a 90 westfalia that about once a month or so loses power after
&gt; running about 2 miles. It will slow right down and stall. i can always
&gt; start it right up again and it will run oK at an idle but backfire and
&gt; stall if given any gas. It will do this for maybe about 2 minutes then as
&gt; it gets a bit warmer it runs fine again an the problem may not happen
&gt; again for weeks. I have checked for bad grounds but all looks fine . I
&gt; would be grateful for any suggestions. thanks in advance. Ron Mighton

Though there are a number of other things known to cause this type of
problem, you might want to *re-check* those ground connections.  I had
precisely this problem with my '91 Westy and it wasn't until the dealer
actually disconnected, cleaned and reconnected *all* of the ground straps
(there are several) that the problem was fixed.  Apparently the on-board
electronics are extremely sensitive to the ground potentials or ground
loop currents that can develop from even minute ground path resistances.
Simple visual inspections, or even re-tightening, of the ground
connections may not be enough.
