        A buddy of mine has a canoe, so we're taking it out this weekend
hopefully. I havent gone canoeing for about 3 years now, and am just pumped
to get out in it. Every time I go hiking or camping I always always always
wish I had a flotation device of some sort with me so I could go paddle down
the river, laze about the lake, or run the rapids.
        But theres one hitch...of course. I have a westy, but no roof rack
or mounting device. I was curious as how any of you beloved listees carry
your canoes? I saw these small foamy pads at Canadian Tire (flaps) that
might be able to fit over the canoe edges so I could put it on top and tie
it down well, but I think that may not be enough.
        So.......I await your wisdom.
