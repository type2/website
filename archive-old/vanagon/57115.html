Subject: Re: doors/slidingdoor

I've always appreciated the nicety of being able to go in/out the sliding
door when other cars are too close for me to comfortably open the front
doors OR when the wind is blowing big time and I don't want to risk having
one of the front doors blow off. Just some considerations ...
