So Thom Fitzpatrick says:

Oh great.  Now I have Thom doing my reports for me!  (Believe me Thom, I
don't mind at all..) :)

&gt;         Well, I got to see how tall a Westy is myself for once, as I watched
&gt; S Johnson back his vanagon into his not-quite-all-the-way-open garage door!

Doh!!   This happens occasionally.  Usually when I'm in a hurry.  Just minor
scraps to the pop-top.  Nothing serious.  Good for a laugh obviously. ;)

&gt;         We put the new door on his single cab, piece of cake, since he
&gt; followed my advice of liquid-wrenching the heck out of it!  Learned him some
&gt; new stuff about bus construction while I was at it!  He then helped me bleed
&gt; the brakes on the '56 and distribute brake fluid all over Johnson's half
&gt; acre, and I bailed home.

Piece of cake cept' for the inner door handle opener wouldn't budge off
of the old door.  Soaked it in liquid-wrench for later.

&gt;         Then the famous Matt and Joel were scheduled to arrive in an hour or
&gt; so.  On the way home from Steve's house, I stopped off at a defunct nursery
&gt; and rescued 2 eucalyptus and a birch tree.  When I got home, Steve called to
&gt; say M &amp; J were at his place and on the way over.  Knowing how quickly Steve
&gt; operates, I was able to get all three trees planted before they arrived!

I think Thom cut off the root balls and stuck the trees in the ground. 
What do you others think?  ;)

&gt; 
&gt;         All in all it was a fun day.  After they left, I took a nap, and
&gt; still have not got the new battery put in my bus nor the tranny fluid
&gt; checked/topped up.

I'm expecting a phone call, any time, &quot;Steve, can you come give me a jump?&quot;

;p

Well, after leaving Thom's, we hit a couple of &quot;Quickie Marts&quot; and finally
found a Magic Ad (local ad rag) and found absolutely no prospects and no
&quot;Quickie's&quot; either.  ;)

So we headed back towards my place and I wanted to do a quick stop off
at a neighbors who had a couple of Westy's ('81 and '77 as it turns out)
and see if his might for sale or if he knew of any others.  We stopped
and chatted with him for a bit and he only knew of an '84 some lady at
a local shop was selling.  He talked with us about VWs (what else?) and
admired my '91 Camper and then we said good-bye.  

Matty, Joel and I figured that the '84 was probably going to be out of
their price range.  We went back to my house and discussed the options.

I checked the list and the internet with nothing doing there.  I was 
really dissappointed that I could locate a nice '70's Westfalia.  I 
felt like I had been telling somebody about a great fishing spot and
that the fish just literally jump into your boat.  Then have the person
show up with ya at the great spot and get absolutely no bites.  :(

Well Matty and Joel were gracious about it.  I told them I'd keep looking.
Dean Anderson told Matty at Thom's house that he'd be looking.  We even
called Martha for inspiration and she and Matty talked for a bit and 
discussed a future get-together.

Matty and Joel made arrangements to meet Joels sister in San Fran. and
after a bit of chit-chat, they headed off into the night.

Some things you-all should know about the Westy they're looking for.
They're trying to find a '70's type in the oh 1500 - 2500 range.
Matty showed off a picture a previously sold '69 pop-top that I think
he got quite attached to.  So I think a '69 - '71 would be perfect for
him.  So if any of you in the area spot a nice running Westy in those
years, I'm sure Matty would appreciate you dropping me, Thom or Dean
a line.  I have his phone number with answering machine plus he said
he'd call me to check out any progress on locating one.

Thanks,

Steven
