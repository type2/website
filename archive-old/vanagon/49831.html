Subject: '88 Wolfsburg Repair or Sell

In the last year, fuel lines have been replaced, radiator 
reconditioned, new cylinder block, new water pump, clutch installed. 
This week over heating problems has caused the stud rod to break off 
from the motor body and either a new or reconditioned engine will need 
to be considered. Is it worth $2800+ to get the van up and running or 
will we be faced with more repair problems? 130,000 miles has been 
logged on van.  If we sell it in its current state, what would be a 
fair price? Original owners, interior well maintained, exterior has 
dent on rear driver side.  Thank you for your input.
