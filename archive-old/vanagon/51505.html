Subject: CCC's location?


We can use some input here.  Kathy Myers is working fast and furiously
on our behalf up in Mammoth to try and locate a place for us to rent
for the January campout, probably either the 3rd or 4th weekend
in January, depending on the vote input.  IN case the dates, don't work
out with what she finds up there, I'm wondering if any of you may
have private connections to a place we could rent as a group up
in the snow, at preferably reasonable rates.  I'm thinking maybe
something like with a large living-type room with fireplace, for
us all to congregate inside, nice kitchen for group meals, maybe
3 or so baths, and various nooks and crannies with beds, or places
where we can set up sleeping quarters for perhaps 12-20 people.  The
number of people is at this point a guess, but just to give you
an idea.

, so that
we can check it out.  Thanks!
