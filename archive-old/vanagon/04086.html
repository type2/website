Subject: politically correct


DC:  a person of mass is a fatso, yes.  I thought maybe I could
use that term on Steve, since he described eating, drinking,
and sleeping thru most of his vacation, while his poor
gyno-companion had to drive and drive and drive !  Perhaps
I should have used a nicer term:  metabolically challenged?
alternative body image?  motivationally deficient?  metaphysically
different?  cosmetically oppressed?   ;)
