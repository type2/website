Subject: Re: Faulty wiper &quot;parking&quot;

Go to the wiring diagram and check every connection to be sure they are on
the proper terminals. &quot;Park&quot; is a function done in the motor, unless
something tells it to keep running.

&gt;Replacing the motor the three times, as well as the switch and intermittent
