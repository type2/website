Subject: Re: Good Body Shop in Seattle??

Don't know how many places you know in Seattle, I'm a VW and Seattle
and US newbie myself. I don't have any particular place for body work
that I can recommend but so far we have been pleased with the work of

Schaffner Motors
21705 Highway 99
Lynnwood
Tel 778-6900

The owner is from Germany (just like myself) and I heard he is 
particularly good for the air-cooled VWs. Check it out!

Another place for parts:   Bry's (don't know address)

Good luck
Rainer
