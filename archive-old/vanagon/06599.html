Martha observes:

&gt;Firlie blumenvasen hold flowers. MALE blumenvasen hold stuff like
&gt;thistles, cactus, weeds.....

What sort of blumenvasen do you use to hold roaches??? A Grateful
Dead blumenvasen???  I can see it now...Jerry Garcia goes from
making designer ties at $35/a pop to designer blumenvasen...

perhaps these could be called BUDvasen??
