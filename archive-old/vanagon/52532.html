&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas how I might get a used VW motor (too heavy for UPS) from
Phoenix 
&gt; to Philadelphia at a reasonable cost?
&gt; -Ron Salmon

Motor Freight by Truck can do it, however the engine will have to be crated
first ( a wooden one ). I've had numerous engines shipped this way, and
although it takes a while longer it is very comparable to UPS given the
weight.
