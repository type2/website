David C. asks about securing Madeleine's seat:

&gt;3) Does any one have any experience in installing &quot;anchors&quot; for rear (and
&gt;forward) facing baby seats? At present, Madeleine's chair can only go in
&gt;the front
&gt;because of the three point anchor; we would prefer to move the seat to the
&gt;rear bench but this would require a third anchor point right?  


And Tim S. responded with:

&gt;We put in an anchor high up in the rear corner, by removing the engine air 
&gt;grill then drilling through the tin. I bought a mounting kit, Canadian
&gt;Tire, 


Umm, excuse me if I've missed something here, but doesn't the rear bench
have lap belts?  On the rear facing childseat that we have, we just cinch
down the lap belt and make sure that the belt is securely entrenched in
the built-in slots on the seat.  As long as the belt is tight, I can not
detect any movement with the childseat.  I've also mounted seats at the
outboard positions, in which case I just use the lap portion of the 3-point,
and let the shoulder portion take up the rest of the slack (into the inertial
reel).  Oh, BTW, this is in an EV.

With the forward-facing seat we just use the shoulder and lap portion to-
gether and route them through the appropriate slots molded into the back
of the seat.  In the case of a lap belt, you can skip the shoulder portion...

Do Vanagon benches only come with lap belts?
