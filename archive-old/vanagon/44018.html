Bo,

Did you try them on front or back.  I have some, but have not tried them 
for a fit yet.  On the front of my 84 it uses the bolt method, on the 
back the nut method.  Did you try the Merecedes 15&quot; on front or back?  I 
was wondering on the front if the Mercedes' lug would work.  Just curious.
