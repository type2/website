&gt;&gt;The man I spoke with there knew just what I was talking about before I
&gt;&gt;really described it and said to send them the old little plastic odometer
&gt;&gt;gear as a sample and they would send back a new one, for &quot;about 8 bucks&quot;.

&gt;Wow, if they had offered that to me when I called, it would have saved me a
&gt;lot of time.  When I told them I had taken my Vanagon speedo apart and
&gt;found a broken gear, they just told me it would be $75 to repair it.  Guess
&gt;I should have been a little more aggressive.

That's why I was so surprised, all of the other instrument shops I've talked
to, about 8 of them, wouldn't consider selling just the gear.  I can
understand that if the speedometer was affected in any way by the repair,
because it is a calibratable thing, and repairing it requires skills they
can't assume the average person has, which could potentially bring a
liability to them.  The odometer, on the other hand, is not calibratable.
(unless you can find gears with fractional numbers of teeth... ;P )  When I
asked him about the gear, I was specific in saying odometer, and not
speedometer, but I don't know if that was what made a difference.
