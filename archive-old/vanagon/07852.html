&gt; Just kidding-- I know there's no such thing as a 'quick' question.  
&gt; Here's the deal:
&gt; 
&gt; '72 Camper, 56K miles, parked since 1985 and definately a tow-home 
&gt; job, red squirrels gotten into it, known exhaust problems
&gt;  but was running/being driven when parked, 
&gt; some perforation body rust ahead of rear wheels otherwise quite 
&gt; solid, totally oxidized paint, needs lots of TLC and fresh rubber 
&gt; parts.  Oh, its got AC (yuck) and a complete tent setup!  Is this 
&gt; worth $500?  What is it worth?  (this may be my Norton replacement, 
&gt; BUT no commitments yet)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;  Probably aren't any quick answers either. As the ex-owner of a '72, I'd 
  recommend going for a different year. According to the &quot;VW Bus Custom
  Handbook&quot; '72s are particularly rust prone. It was the first year of the 
  Type IV engine in the bus, and while my engine never gave trouble, they
  didn't add that cool hatch in the top of the engine compartment which
  helps with access to the dual carbs and air cleaner until '73. '72's also
  have the old steering box (the last year) which has a reputation of heavier
  steering and needing more attention than the later steering boxes.      

  If you like that particular camper layout, it was also used in '73 (and 
  earlier Westys, of course). The '73 has a bit more smog plumbing (I don't
  know if you have to keep that stuff operational where you are) but is more
  desireable in other ways, in my opinion. 

  On the other hand, the '72 was the last year of the &quot;old&quot; look (bumpers,
  low-mounted front turn signals, etc) and the only &quot;old&quot; look with the
  performance of the Type IV engine. If you like that look better it may
  be the right thing for you. 

  Maybe the owner will sell you the tent seperately??
