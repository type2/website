Subject: UPDATE: helping VWoA

Hi Volks,
  Just wanted to drop a line and say thanks to everyone who has written me
about my upcoming trip to VWoA headquarters and their comments to pass
along to the Big Chiefs.   Anyway, with less than a week to the big trip I
wanted to let everyone know I'm still open to anyones comments.  Here is
the top comments and suggestions I have recieved so far.

1.  Service and parts:  Basically everyones in agreement, SERVICE
SUCKS.More than one trip to get the problem fixed, service personel that
know very little about the cars they work on. And service managers who seem
to jerk you around more than getting the problem fixed.  The price of parts
is outragous.  Why by a $70 part from VW when the FLAPS down the street can
sell it for $25.  If the they can sell it that cheap then why can't VW?
2.  Sales:  Most think the new marketing plans are working.  There does
seem to be more new VW's on the road.  However, there isn't enough product
targeting;  you see the drivers wanted slogan and the great lease rate you
can get, but how about pushing the cars themselves. IE: The Corrado. It was
a good car but no one knew it.  Most everyone thinks the prices are a bit
high too.
3.  The concept 1/AKA The New Beetle:  Now that is a point of disscussion.
Many like the car but are afraid it will be priced right out of the market.
Most, myself included, want this car to be a inexpensive, no frills, entry
level car.   Many do not like the beetle name given to it.  Some thing (as
VW does) that the car will push VW back into the spotlight again as the old
beetle did years ago.  Some think that it will be a flash in the pan type
car,  People will like it because of the nostalga it invokes.  Once the fun
is out then the car will fall be the wayside.
4:  Quality:  On this most said they think VW makes a good car, but the
minor problems get annoying, IE, broken switches and plastic do dads that
fall off.
5.  Involvment:  Most said that VW needs to get more involved or at least
pretend to be interested in whats happening.  Sponsor shows, race events
taht sort of thing.  (Thats one of the preposes of the big meeting.)

Well thats a quick look at some of the things I'll try to talk to the
people at VW about. Any more suggetions, please e-mail me direct by next
Wednesday nite (5/1) Thanks again and take care.
