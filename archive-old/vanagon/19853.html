&gt; Yep too! VW-service sucks and VWoA is building pieces of shit these days, the newer they get, the shitter they are! What happened to the good old VW's (like those 2,000,000 miles bugs ?). I'll never buy
&gt; a VW again... at least not new.
&gt; 

Well... I agree that VW engineering is lacking, I don't fully agree that it's
a complete piece-o-shit.  I happen to like my van alot.  From reading your
postings about your van experiences, I think the problems you had are much
more the fault of bad service and unwillingness on the part of the dealers/
garages to fix the real problems.  And when they don't do the work correctly,
it compounds the problems.  My complaint is primarily against VW's service
department (what an oxymoron) which refuses to really try to fix the problems
and instead side-steps them hoping you'll go away or put up with it.
