&gt;It it easy enough fix this or should I just let it go?
&gt;
&gt;The tires are wearing evenly, which is what I really care about but
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Uh, mine aren't; I thought it was the nature of the vehicle since I can see
the angle at witch the wheels are slanted (inward towards the ground in the
front and out wards toward the ground in the back)  Does this mean there is
something wrong with my '78 because my wheels are wearing along the sides on
the back tires.

Questions, comments anyone?
