Subject: high energy ignition

I read Bob Hoover's sermon on upgrading the stock ignition with a CD type
ignition and, of course, *need* to have something like that! Looked
through a recent HotVWs magazine (featuring an article on an ignition
conversion sold by CB Performance) and also checked an old JCWhitney
catalog. There is a choice of solutions and a choice of brands (Crane,
MSD, Allison?, Universal, and more), and probably also a choice of prices. 
While some kits worked for --or were available for-- all distributors,
others would only replace --or work with-- an 009 (my FI, type4-powered
'75 bus, however, wouldn't run well w/ an 009).  I would be grateful for
any information (options, prices, etc.) that can help me make a choice. 

Thanks in advance!  --Sami

PS: a system universal enough to work with various cars (including those 
with 6 cylinders) would be great!
