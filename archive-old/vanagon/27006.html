In a message dated 95-10-18 12:39:13 EDT, you write:

&gt;I found this over on the Audi list, and thought it would be 
&gt;appropriate for any list members who even dare drive their 
&gt;busses/vanagon's in the fast lane.  (Eurovan drivers don't need to 
&gt;worry about this):

The Gray Ghost ('88 Vanagon GL) takes great exception and is highly insulted
by your  insinuation that she can't keep up in the fast lane.  Sure, it may
take her a while to get up to speed, but I really have no trouble with 70MPH
plus in the fast lane (BTW, I don't go into the left lane until she IS up to
speed).

While I drive her less aggressively than my '92 Bonneville, the Gray Ghost
doesn't like the lane blockers, either.  I think that thermonuclear
vaporization is quite adequate and justified in ridding our nation of these
unwanted cankers.  If I could only figure out how to keep the fallout from
getting sucked into the air vents.....;-)
