Subject: Resolved (yey!)! Temp Indicator On Dash rises to max: 84
  Vanagon

Hi everyone:

I appreciate everyone's input on the coolant reservoir of my 84 Vanagon.
Thanks everyone!  I treid to perform the cheapest of everyone's
suggestions:  the one where I don't have to get parts yet :-) Luckily, I
was able to find the problem without having to go to the VW dealer!

Resolution:
1. poured more of the mixture from the remaining coolant/distilled water
mixture.  LED light on dashboard still kept on blinking.  Poured a
little bit of distilled water on the coolant bottle to dilute the
mixture.  After a few more drops of water and a bit of waiting (about
3-4 seconds), the LED stopped blinking!  It was like &quot;magic&quot; or
&quot;non-magic&quot; (as Bo and Malcolm would debate back and forth) ;-)

2. I performed the same procedure, but this time in the round coolant
reservoir.  Wow. it really worked, light stopped blinking...  

I was so happy I gave the Vanagon an oil change (I'll recycle the oil,
of course, wouldn't want the Earth to die so soon).

BTW, FYI, in the SF Bay Area, East Bay, TriCed and Alameda County Waste
Mgmt recycle coolant for free.  A bunch of places (Pep Boys, Kragen,
Grand Auto, in addition to Triced and ACWM) recycle used oil.

Thanks again!

John

original engine, no substantial leaks yet, broken antenna, crappy
speakers, no tunes, broken sliding door interior handle, new wipers!
