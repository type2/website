Subject: Re: gasoline politics

&gt;&gt; really wanted to make a joke out of that, but I don't know any German
&gt;&gt; metal groups.
&gt;
&gt;How about the Scorpions?

        Or Warlock. Accept. Udo. Krokus? Helloween? That's all I can think
of right now. There's lots more, but it's been many years since I listened
to Metal bands of *any* nationality. &quot;Goes to show, you don't ever know...&quot;

Peace,
