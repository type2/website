Dave, I replaced the accelerator pump diaphram in last rebuild (last
weekend) of the carb. Later, I adjusted the setting for the accelerator
pump for it to pump the minimum amount of fuel, thinking it might be
pumping too much. Didn't seem to help. 

Thanks! Joe

&gt; &gt;First, let me tell you what I'm calling a &quot;flat spot.&quot; Symptom: Bus idles 
&gt; &gt;fine. Accelerates while cold. Once she warms up, will only accelerate

&gt; 
&gt; This sounds like a problem with your accelerator pump on your carb
&gt; to me.  The accelerator pump squirts a little extra gas down the
&gt; throat of the carb.  If it pumps too much, it will momentarily
&gt; flood and &quot;stall&quot;.  If it doesn't pump enough, your engine has to
&gt; build momentum from the other components of the carb in conjuction
&gt; with either the vacuum or centrifugal advance of the distributor.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;... This also could be (I hope) due to
&gt; &gt;some slightly stiff components on the carb (specifically, the throttle
&gt; &gt;valve lever, which doesn't always return completely).
&gt; 
&gt; There are basically two systems that affect your problem: the 
&gt; ignition system and the fuel system.  You have pretty much
&gt; eliminated the ignition problems.  If you have KNOWN problems
&gt; with the fuel system, those are the problems to fix FIRST.
&gt; 
&gt; BTW the accelerator pump diaphram is included in the carb rebuild
&gt; kit.
&gt; 
&gt; Good Luck,
&gt; 
&gt; Dave
