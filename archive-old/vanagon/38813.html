Subject: Camelback VW deal!


Hello all,
Just writing to thank the individual who posted about Camelback VW in
Phoenix.  I just bought a Bra for my '86 Westy for 20% over cost.  This
came to about $89.  My dealer (Boulder, CO) wanted $127, and laughed at
me when I asked if he would sell it for 20% over cost.  No doubt!
Working the numbers shows that my dealer sells things at around 75% over
cost.  Even with shipping ($5) I save 25% buying it from Camelback.  Not
only that but it would have taken a week and a half for my dealer to get
it, while I had it in 5 days from Phoenix--and they had to order it.  I
think that I will be buying a lot of things from Camelback considering I
get it quicker and cheaper.  The world dosn't really work this way does it?

Here is the information again for those who missed it:

		Camelback Volkswagon
		Phoenix, AZ 85016
		(800)876-5199
		(602)205-8768 Fax

Thanks again to the original poster, sorry I can't remember your name.

Cory
'86 Westfalia
