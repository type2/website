Subject: Re: Mounting Spare off of USA bumper on split

&gt;I want (need) to mount my spare on the front of the 1959
&gt;bus. I would rather not drill holes through its face, but
&gt;that may be how I end up doing this.

My bus came with a front mounted tire, which coveres up a bunch of rust and
a pretty bashed up nose piece. If I had a cherry bus I would NEVER mount
the tire there. I would get a cool roof rack and sticka couple of spares up
there. I guess it might mess up the mileage, but it sure would look cool.
I'm collecting stuff to make a rack now, and I'm gonna add a mount for two
spares for sure.

Of course that means I'll have to fix the front end ;-)
