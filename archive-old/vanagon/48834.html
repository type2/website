I called this guy, here's what he told me:

1986 Syncro Crew Cab, 70k, lt. brown, no squawks.  This is still under canadian
registry, though it is sitting in Southern California.  He's asking 18K, and
I could find no options (definately no TriStar!)

18k for one in the US is probably a reasonable price, but loans are pretty

Sounds like a fun bus, wish I was rich.  

 
i would be inclined to say that 18k (american dollars, right?)
 is kinda insane, for that transporter....
if someone had that kind of money to spend, i'll set you up with a
 syncro crewcab turbo diesel, direct from austria....
 1987 models are being auctioned as we speak....
 but, it would be expensive to import, but it could be done for maybe 10k
 it's really ashame, my friend has returned to his job at s.d.p in
 austria, thats where the real trucks are.....

later
