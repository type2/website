That's weird,
Mine (85) does exactly the opposite...
It will suddenly show no gas, cold engine for an indeterminant length 
of time, then come back to normal and the coolant light will flash
like it thinks that the ignition has just been turned on.  I blame my
problem on a bad ground ( a bad pos. wouldn't effect all three would it?)
It doesn't effect the bulbs that illuminate the instruments, but I bet 
that they have a seperate ground... 
I also haven't considered this to be a high priority problem to fix.
