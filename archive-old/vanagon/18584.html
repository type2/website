Subject: Detergent or Non???

    I was reading thru my Muir book today, and in the chapter on overhauls he
talks about making a decision to use either detergent or non-detergent oil in
a freshly overhauled engine. Can someone tell me what the difference is? I'll
be making that decision myself in the near future and, since reading it, it's
plagued me.....
    Post Script:
       Any of you cats who might've trekked from the east coast across
country (going as far west as Grand Junction, Colo.), via the marvels of VW
road tripping, I certainly welcome your insights and suggestions!! I'll be
camping the entire way across and would like to take 2-3 weeks to get there
with as much adventure as I can pack in without getting myself jailed or too
far south : )
       Oh! And!!! Just what are the emissions laws in those parts??? I hadn't
begun to take that into consideration until just today and now I'm wondering
if I'll have to add some junk to Ramona's belly to get her all legal upon my
arrival. &quot;Preciate it, I do!
