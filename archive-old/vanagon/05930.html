Subject: Re: screens

I redid my screens in the '81 westy using elmers glue (I know,
I know, it's not waterproof, but it's not like I'm going to 
drive thru the carwash THAT often, especially with the windows
open).  I used non-wire screen fabric I purchased at
the local hardware store, which was very inexpensive.  Seems
to be made out of something rather more soft and pliable than
typical metal-type screens.  Anyway, just cut it to fit, applied
lots of glue in several layers, under, around, and over, so that
the edges are completely clamped down, protected, and encased,
and shouldn't ravel or fray.  The whole thing seemed to work
out fine, at least so far so good...
