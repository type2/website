This sounds like crap to me.  Overtighten a 2mm thick rubber gasket against 
two aluminium pieces and it will simply extrude. Next time you find an 
O-ring seal check out how well the seal is 'encapsulauted' by a deep groove 
and close fitting lid. This keeps the seal from being shot out under 
pressure, say by your brake fluid.  Rubber or any compliant gaskets are to 
be avoided like the plague when used in a corrosive environment. They lead 
to crevice corossion in which pockets of fluid are created next to the 
metal. The local concentrations of electrolytes cause galvanic corrosion 
cells to be set up, leading to pitting.

        A real fix to this problem would be the use of hard gaskets, that 
don't compress so much.  Higher clampling pressures become possible, thinner 
stiff gaskets prevent the crevice formation.  Isn't this how it's done in 
all other vehicles. Has anyone broken a non-rusty stud off yet?, $229 to 
raceware for a standard build engine seems pointless. And it isn't rusty 
studs that have caused my heads to leak, it's corroded sealing faces.  Snake 
oil I say, at ten times the price of Slick-50 no less.  Tim Smith
