Subject: Battery for Vanagon


 To:	vanagon_at_lenti.med.umn_dot_edu		Inet 	


Hi Volks,
I am looking to replace the battery in my 82 westy (Helga). Can
anyone recommend the best ones to buy, and what the dimensions
need to be to fit under the passenger seat? I use her as my daily
driver, and take her on road trips at least twice a month. When
camping, I use the battery for running the stereo, and some
lights, usually taking the battery to it's limit. So it does get
drained regularly. Eventually, I would like to go to a two battery
setup, but just need to find the time.
Any help would be greatly appreciated. 
Thanks,
Steve Termecz
