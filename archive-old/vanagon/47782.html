   Most of the indicators in the center of the Vanagon dash is
   L.E.D.   but the blue high beam indicator is not.

&gt; &gt; &quot;So what&quot;  you say?  Well, if you bunch blue, green and red  LEDs together and
&gt; &gt; they are reasonably matched in output you get WHITE light!!!  In fact I
&gt; &gt; remember that was pointed out in the article as an option.  Now if I could

&gt; It's been a while, and I'm certainly no electrician (geologist), but I seem
&gt; to remember my 80 Vanagon had a blue LED for the brights indicator.  Am I
&gt; dreaming?
