Subject: Re: Moo is leaking Big Time!

The water pump is on the left side of the engine, so a leak on the
right side probably ain't the pump.  The most likely thing to leak on the
right rear of this engine is the *!_at_##$!_at__at_ plastic coolant pipe fitting
where it attaches to the head.  And people talk about good German engineering!
I know -- Lucas musta designed this for them (I know, we aren't supposed
to dis Lucas...).  OK.  There is this pipe, attached to the rear of the
right side of the engine, and it's plastic, and it ain't worth crap, and it
probably cracked or warped in the cold.  Check this first -- you might be
lucky and find this has failed.  It's a simple part to fix -- I think its
replacement might be metal.  I fixed mine temporarily with RTV and a prayer,
and it seems fine after 10,000 miles, but it only means that it still is
about to fail...  I'll fix it proper someday.
