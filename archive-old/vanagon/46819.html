Subject: The Inuvik Run - Prolog



                   The Inuvik Run -- Prelude


Two weeks ago I returned from a fifteen day trip to Kansas City. 
Tomorrow I set out on a four thousand mile run to Inuvik, a
village in the Mackenzie River delta.  Followed by the four
thousand mile trip home.  I expect to be away a month or more.  

The Mackenzie River empties into the Beaufort Sea, otherwise
known as the Arctic Ocean.  Inuvik, which is pronounced with the
emphasis on the second syllable, is located at 68 degrees North
Latitude, 133 degrees West Longitude.  I am presently just north
of San Diego, California, about 33 N, 117 W.  In plain English,
that's a hell of a trip.

In preparing for this run more has gone wrong than right.
For one thing, I don't have a surfboard to take along.  Nor will
I be able to rent a board once I arrive; I have just learned
Inuvik does not have a single surf shop.  Most of the folks
making the run, and there are a gaggle of them, are planning to
fly out of Inuvik for a day of aerial sight-seeing and a visit to
Tuktoyaktuk, which is pronounced exactly as it is spelled.  For
me, this is a low-budget trip.  I'd planned to spend the day
surfing.  No board means no surfing.  I guess I'll just hang
out at the beach.  

Maps are another failing.  For some reason, British Columbia does
not want me to have a map of their province.  I asked but did not
receive, not once but thrice.  On the other hand, the Northwest
Territories, which has only two roads, sent me a map for each. 
I'm advised a map of the Yukon may yet arrive, its delay due to
bureaucratic snarls rather than unfriendliness.  It should prove
handy if I ever go insane and want to drive there again.  I
figure the odds are about the same as finding lips on a chicken. 

Instead, I have a very pretty map of Canada, borrowed from a
Collier's Encyclopedia, 1949 edition.  Unfortunately, Inuvik
did not exist in 1949 nor did the Dempster Highway.  Or perhaps
they did and I just can't see them.  The map, about eight by ten
inches, is kind of small.

And I've lost the itinerary for the trip.  It was in my lap-top,
which died and went to heaven on my way to Kansas City.  Tobin
Copley, the fellow to blame for the trip, sent me another copy
but I managed to erase it while trying to print it.  Which makes
me wonder if an itinerary is really necessary.  There's only one
road for most of the run, and only a handful of towns.  I figured
I'd pick up another copy when I got to Vancouver but now it looks
like I can't get to Vancouver in time for the starting gun due to
a side-trip I must make enroute, dropping off an engine, making
sure it runs and mechanical stuff like that. Which also means
I'll miss the drunken Bon Voyage party.

Without an itinerary my plan is to take a few-short cuts, shoot
one section of rapids and get ahead of the convoy.  I'll fall in
behind when they roll past, assuming I can get ahead of them. 
Since they'll all be fighting massive hangovers, odds are no one will
notice my tardy arrival.

The only other problems are the bus and what to wear and a place
to sleep and something to eat and money for gas.  I won't mention
painting the house, which I was supposed to do after returning
from KC and before leaving for Inuvik but haven't.  My wife is not
happy about that.

The problem with the groceries is that while I'm spent a lot of
time south of the Line I've never lived rough north of it.  Down
south, you get along fine so long as you have some fishing
tackle, a lime squeezer and a bottle of stuffed olives.  You can
drop by the local Conasupo for anything else you need, except
Black Bear.  Oso Negro is a staple in the Bajanese diet.  

Judging from my map, there aren't a lot of places to go shopping
in the Nortwest Territories.  And I'll bet none of them have Oso
Negro.  Probably don't even carry Crow.  I'd better make a note
to pack some Cuervo and a gallon or two of Oso Negro.  Cuervo is
handy in case of snake bite.  Pour a little Cuervo on them,
they'll leave you alone.  Them snakes can't stand the stuff.

My biggest worry is the 1965 Microbus.  It started making a funny
noise when I hauled the trash cans down to the road last Sunday. 
I thought it was just the cans banging around but the noise is still
there, maybe a little louder than before.  I haven't driven it
much since then.  I'm hoping I can figure out what it is before I
get to Canada, as I understand parts for antique buses are hard
to come by.

As for clothes, I've got my levis, boots and a couple of shirts. 
Plus my jams of course, and my flip-flops.  They said I should
bring something for the bugs.  I packed a can of Raid.  The best
defense is a good offense.  Can of Raid and a Zippo, you can
chase off a bear.

Money is always a problem on a run like this, what with gas being
so expensive nowadays.  I'd better pack my Baja Gas Station. 
That's a shiny red one-gallon gas can.  That one gallon can of
gas has carried me from Cabo to LA and back again.  You just
stand there by your rig holding up the can with a hopeful look on
your face.  Folks stop, fill up the can, chat a while, wish you
good luck.  Takes ten cans to fill the tank, which sometimes
means standing there all afternoon, waving the damn thing at the
tourists.  But once the tank is filled, drive on!

I'm sort of embarrassed by my failure to properly prepare for
this run but I've been busier than a one armed paper-hanger. 
Before I can head for Inuvik I've promised to deliver an engine
to a fellow.  He's up in northern California, five hundred miles
or so north of me.  I'd hoped to deliver the engine last week,
come home and pack up for the trip.  Once the engine is out of
the cargo bay there would be room for a bed and groceries and
clothes but I ran out of time and figured, what the hell -- with
five hundred miles of northing under my belt I might as well go
ahead and tackle the other seventy-five hundred.  Win, lose or
draw, it beats having to paint the house.  But I sure feel
strange, traveling without a surfboard on the roof.  Surfboards
are handy things.

I just noticed a thing here on the back of my map.  Sez 'Land of
the Midnight Sun'.  Better pack my shades.  If I can't surf I can
always work on my tan.
