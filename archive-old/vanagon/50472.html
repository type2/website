&gt; List,
&gt; 
&gt;   The shop I work for,(Volks Cafe) have done a number of these 
&gt; conversions.  As long as you have a Diesel to get parts from, it's 
&gt; &quot;Fairly&quot; striaght forward.
&gt; 
&gt;   One of the biggest problems we run into is that the Fuel Ijector lines 
&gt; need to be lengthened. Other than that, a little fabricating of the 
&gt; intake to the manifold and you have a very nice running Vanagon.
&gt; 
&gt;   We've played with a few different exaust systems too, and found that 
&gt; the stock Diesel works the best!  Every other kind we've tried has 
&gt; broken quickly.
&gt; 
&gt;   I get to drive these Conversions, and I've driven Vanagons with V-6 
&gt; Power plants too, I Really like the &quot;Feel&quot; of the In-Line 4 Cylinder 
&gt; engine in a Vanagon!
&gt; 
&gt;   We also have a customer that has a 5.0 Ford engine in his Vanagon, 
&gt; Quite a scary feeling to drive that one!
&gt; 
&gt;   Anyone that wants more info on these e-mail me and I'll do my best to 
&gt; answer any questions you might have.
&gt; 
&gt;   Kyle

    3- what about the air  induction system?

         Thanks   Eric Zeno
