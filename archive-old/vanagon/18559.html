Subject: Original Westphalia tent: What's it worth?
Date: Tue, 30 May 1995 22:10:51 GMT

I have a 1970 Westphalia bus that my neighbor
wants to give me $3000.00 for.  It is all original,
I'm the 2nd owner, and I guess that $3000.00 is
a fair price for the vehicle.  He also wants the
tent that I have, that matches the bus.  My
question is, what is an original 1970 orange canvas
tent worth?  It is in very good to new condition.

Please e-mail me at dunne_at_tellabs_dot_com with any
opinions.  Thanks.
