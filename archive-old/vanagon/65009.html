 I have the direct connection with Python too, My turnaround time has
 been about 1 week from Python.

   Anyone that needs any of their parts rebuilt let me know.

   On the Fuel Pumps though, A Rebuilt one for, $99.00 verses $160.00 For
 a NEW Bosch one?  I'd go with the new more than likely.

Hi Kyle,

As a vendor of this stuff Kyle, I'm curious what the relative profit margins
are on this remanufactured vs the new parts.  Some places really push the
Reman parts, other places throw the stigma on them.  I've suspected that the
profit margin is often higher on the Reman stuff if the parts house has a
good direct supplier deal.  There at times seems to be little rhyme or reason
to how various categories of parts are prices.  Any insight you'd care to
share with us hapless consumers?

Also, since you have the Python connection, it here an 800 number people on
the list could call to get the name of a truly local parts house in their
respective areas?    I was not able to squeeze this info out of my local guy.
 It would save alot of extra postage on shipping the cores back and forth.

I am generally impressed with the quality of their stuff.  How would you rate
their various products for reliability?  Of the parts you've sold what kind
of stuff have you had 'bring backs' on?  Are these fuel pumps prone to early
failure?

Thanks for your comments ahead of time,

Carl
