Subject: Re: propane tank label--dange...

Under Florida Law, the label must be firmly affixed to the tank or the
propane dealer will not fill the tank.  Some of the newer tanks have all the
information (date of manufacture, last date of inspection, etc..) stamped
into the collar guard of the tank and therefore will produce no need for a
label...
