Subject: oil temp gauge FAQ?


Greetings,

I am going to be driving my '82 vanagon from st. augustine (FL) to 
Irvona, PA.  Then, over to Woods Hole, MA for the summer.  And, 
eventually back down to St. Augustine.  I would realllllllllllly like to 
keep an eye on my engine temp on these trips.  So, my questions are:
1.  what?  what kind of temp guages are easy to install and work.
2.  where?  i am leaving by the end of the month, so &quot;six  to eight weeks 
delivery&quot; is not a possibility.
3.  how?  if there are any tricks (other than righty tighty/lefty loosy) 
for putting these things in, i would appreciate any info.


so.....thanks!!

'85 vanagon (DID) -  looking to be parted out in the FL area, pretty good 
condition except for that blown engine thing.
