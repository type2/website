&gt; The prices are unbelievable. Here's what I see:
&gt;
&gt;PC 300 $55
&gt;PC 600 $158
&gt;PC 1500 $358
&gt;
These prices are LOW.  I paid $70 at Damark for the PC300 earlier this year.


&gt;The only hitch might be that these inverters don't say what kind of wave
&gt;they have. I assume we are talking about a modified sine wave but for all I
&gt;know these are square wave inverters, which would be a disaster I guess. I
&gt;wonder when it would make sense to pay up for a true sine wave.

While the PC300 literature says modified sine wave and the picture in the
manual shows one, the unit's true output (when I viewed it on an
oscilloscope) has quite a spike at the beginning of each &quot;square&quot;.  Even so
it seem to work O.K. to run the TV and cmacorder for the kids on long trips.
