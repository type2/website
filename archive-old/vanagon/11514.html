&gt;Also, does anybody know about how much a pair of good front seats for a '77
&gt;bus would cost. 

I don't have a price, but you might be able to find suitable seats in a
junkyard.  My brother's 1972 has seats from an Audi 4000 sedan.  Very
comfy, and easily fitted.  I heard that Audi 5000 seats are good too.
