Just for the record,
San Diego Spedo Tach , on India St, will sell the gear. I think I paid
about $9 for one about 5 years ago.

&gt; &gt;I started in the best junkyard in San Diego,
&gt; Lemme guess, Interstate VW in North County? In my opinion, it IS the 
&gt; best. I've found weird little parts I used to need for my old 71 I 
&gt; had.
