Subject: Is there a rust 'disolver' that works?

Hi.
Doing some engine compartment cleaning-up and just wondering if anybody has
any advice on a rust treatment that actually works.  There are certain areas
where I cant fully get a wire brush or sander into, or where two pieces of
metal join and I just wanted to know if anyone has any advice.

TIA
ned

P.S.  Please email me directly since I cant always get to all my digests.
 Email to HLPinc_at_aol_dot_com.  Thanks.
