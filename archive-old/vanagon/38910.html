Subject: 1984 Double Cab

 The vehicle was 
BR&gt;featured in the February '94 issue of European Car. Vehicle 
BR&gt;has full towing capability and has complete emmision controls

FWIW, I got this issue and recall reading about it, bright orange,
blindingly fast and powerful for a Vanagon, and frankly about the
most kickin VW truck anyone is likely to ever see.

Now $35k and considering I'm darn sure it is only 2wd, I don't know?
