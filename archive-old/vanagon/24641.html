Subject: Starter Solonoid Blues

A nagging problem I have had with my 81 Westy through several engine
replacements (see 81 Westfalia Blues, posting) has been the sticking
starter solonoid.  On long trips, the transfer of heat from the engine to
the starter housing seems to overheat the solonoid, causing it to fail to
engage.  The cure is to crawl under with a tire iron and rap on the case,
then cross the hot leads to force a revolution.  Then my baby usually
engages and starts.  Anyone else had this problem, and found a cure?  Also,
if you know of a good retrofit air conditioning compressor fit, I would be
grateful!  Last rebuild my boat anchor disappeared.
