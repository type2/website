Well, I finally figure it out.

I stared having the poor running problem Monday, so I start thinking
&quot;what did I change?&quot;  Not much really: I put on fog lights, which are
not even wired yet, and new door seals.

Hmmm.

Anyway, I had to go to Riverbank today for a funeral, and I'm going down 99,
and sho-nuf, its bogging out.  I pulled over, went and looked, nothing seemed
to be amis, so I smacked the carb with a screwdriver a couple of times,
leaned it out about 1/2 turn, and went on my way.

Much better!  For about 10 minutes, then it started happening again.
I stopped again.  This time I did it fast, and when I looked, I could see
faint remains of frost on the manifold!  Aha!  So, I removed the little 
fiberglass cover I'd made for the extra hole in the rear apron, and went
on my way.  

No a sputter since.  I even re-set the governor back to where it was.

What was the problem?  When I put the new engine lid seal on, it started
pulling all the air thru the vents, instead of partially thru the
engine lid.   Well, the air thru the engine lid was _warm_, which alleviated
the icing problem!  By re-opening the hole in the tin, I started pulling hot
air from behind the muffler, and it stopped the icing!
