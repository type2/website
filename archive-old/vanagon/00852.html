Subject: CA emissions



Quick question.  I have an '80 vanagon which recently
passed Virginia emissions with flying colors.  I am moving
to Sacramento, CA in two months.  I am assuming I may
run into some trouble concerning CA's emissions standards.
Are these standards set across the board for the state or are
they left up to county, city, etc...?  What adjustments/enhancements
may I need to make to my exhaust to get my baby to pass?
Any help appreciated.
