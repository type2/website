Just did this yesterday on my '78.  No longer lets out a piercing shriek
when shifting to reverse.  Viva la differance (or words to that effect)!

Just squirted some Moly goo onto the plastic ball joint where the shifter
goes through the floor.
1.  Shifts Queiter!
2.  Shifts Smoother!
3.  Prevents ball joint disintigration (happened to me 3 years ago. Makes it
hard to drive)

Go ahead, Lube your stick.

Peter
