&gt;Howdy Everyone,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Please review this note and act acordingly.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;  I am writing you this to inform you of a very important matter
&gt;&gt; &gt;  currently under review by the FCC. Your local telephone company has
&gt;&gt; &gt;  filed a proposal with the FCC to impose per minute charges for your
&gt;&gt; &gt;  internet service. They contend that your usage has or will hinder the
&gt;&gt; &gt;  operation of the telephone network.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;  We at ContiNet belief that internet usage will diminish if users were
&gt;&gt; &gt;  required to pay additional per minute charges. The FCC has created an
&gt;&gt; &gt;  email box for your comments, responses must be received by February
&gt;&gt; &gt;  13, 1997. Send your comments to isp_at_fcc_dot_gov and tell them what you
&gt;&gt; &gt;  think.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;  Every phone company is in on this one, and they are trying to sneak
&gt;&gt; &gt;  it in just under the wire for litiagation. Let everyone you know about
&gt;&gt; &gt;  this one. Get the e-mail address to everyone you can think of.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;  isp_at_fcc_dot_gov
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;  Please forward this email to all your friends on the internet so all
&gt;&gt; &gt;  our voices may be heard!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Regards,
&gt;
&gt;                       ContiNet
