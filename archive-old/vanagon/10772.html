Subject: Re: yet another steering problem

Both my 83 westy and 84 vanagon have this problem so I assume that vanagons
most likely all have the problem. The problem is the rack pinion steering
gear box mounting bushings are all shrunk and loose. As a result when drive
up to a long bridge and against wind you know what happens then. I guess if
I happen to be sleepy I could end up in water. I found out that the gear
box waggles when the steering wheel is turned back and forth by someone in the
car while I watch under the car. All ball joints and tie rods are tight and
in good shape and I see clearly that the gear box is loose.

Is it possible to replace those bushings without removing the gear box?
The gear box is positioned/secured by 4 bolts and nuts with bushings between
the bolts and the holes of the gear box. 

Do I need to remove the gear box in order to press out the worn busshings 
and press in new ones? If yes, it seems to be much bigger a job that I 
can hanle. It will require an alignment job afterwards.

Any experience anyone? I think fixing this problem will make my vanagons
steer like new.
