Not to take away from SStones' suggestion of a meeting in
Turkey Bay....

On July 15 &amp; 16 Connecticut Volkswagen Association is having its
11th annual summer meet at Lime Rock Park in the northwestern
corner of CT.

Saturday there is Formula Vee Racing and VWs will be driving the
track during the lunch break

Saturday nite is a campout co-sponsored by LiMBO (so there
should be lots of vans there)

Sunday is the All VW Car Show and Swap Meet.

Anyone interested?

Ric
