Subject: Junkyard Vanagon Inventory--KC

Hi Vanagon Listers,

The other day I did an informal phone survey of the 10 late model 
import dismantling yards here in KC.  My question was, did they have any 
Vanagons for parts?  The results: 2 yards have one 85 Vanagon.  I guess I 
wasn't all that surprised.  Only one place laughed at my question.  I 
guess they aren't too common, boneyard wise.
