&gt;Then there were two big backfires and now it won't start, just turns over.
&gt;I checked the stator flap, what else can I try before calling a tow truck?

i know it sounds stupid, but go back and look at the points ... the little
cam-follower just broke in two on my 80 bus, causing pretty much the same
sort of thing. i haven't a clue as to WHY it broke, but it sure messed things
up when it did. replaced them and all was well again.

&gt;Is there anything I can check before throwing in the towel and my wallet
&gt;to have someone tell me the F.I. needs replacing?!

it might also be the fuel injector trigger points down in the distributor.
but i don't recall anybody ever saying that was a &quot;common&quot; problem.
