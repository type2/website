Subject: RE: A.C. causing van to die


&gt;I have a 1985 VW Vanagon Westfalia, we just bought it a month ago, and when 
I
&gt;use the air conditioner the van dies when I come to a stop. Any tips?  Is
&gt;this normal due to the small engine and large requirements of the air
&gt;conditioner?  I would appreciate any tips!!!!


I'm not familiar with VW bus air conditioners. But does it have any vacuum
connections to the intake manifold? If so, any chance any of them are
cracked/leaking/fallen off? A vacuum leak into the manifold will often
make your engine conk out at stops, or at least idle very poorly.

And if a vacuum device that's used only when the AC is on, is leaking,
maybe that's the problem?

...not even $.02 worth, but hope this helps anyway...
