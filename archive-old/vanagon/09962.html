What is probably happening is that when the rad fan comes on it cools 
the coolant down, decreasing its volume (more dense at cooler temps) 
and reducing pressure enough in your system to stop flow out of the 
bleeder valve.  The effect of the fan coming on with respect to the 
volume of coolant can be observed on a 'normal' car with a radiator 
cap ontop the rad.  Watch the coolant level take an immediate dip 
(rad cap off, peering inside filler neck) when the rad fan comes on!  
It resumes the pre-fan level or higher when the fan switches off.
