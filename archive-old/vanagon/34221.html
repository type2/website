Subject: Re: [F] Extra large engines


&gt;Last I saw on PBS a show called something like 'B-29: Frozen in time'.
&gt;[text deleted] Certainly worth seeing if you get excited about really large 

&gt;aircooled engines.  I wonder how many valves and carburetors one of
&gt;those engines had?  If you plan on trying to see it, stop reading, I
&gt;am about to ruin the ending.  [remaining text deleted]
&gt;=======
&gt;I have heard about this, and a real shame that so close to the end it was 
for
&gt;nothing.
&gt;
&gt;I would have a good guess that Bob Hoover might have some interest and 
insight
&gt;on these engines.  I believe that they are/were variants of the Wright 
Cyclone
&gt;engines, radial, air cooled, turbo/or/supercharged . . .


My knowledge is nowhere near Hoover's, but I believe these engines
were the Pratt &amp; Whitney Twin Wasp. Turbocharged, 2800 cubic inches (!),
2,000 horsepower each, driving a propellor at a whopping 900 rpm at cruise,
through a reduction gear assembly at the front.

The engines were impressive, but trouble-prone. The B-29 was known
by pilots and aircrews as &quot;an aborting son of a b*tch&quot;, since every time
a thousand of them took off from Tinian Island in the Pacific to bomb Japan
in WWII, more than a hundred would have to turn back with engine trouble.

Is this the engine that was used on many American fighters, such as the
Chance-Vought F4U Corsair, Republic P-47 Thunderbolt, Grumman F6F
Hellcat, and Grumman F7F Tigercat (which had two!)? Any others?
