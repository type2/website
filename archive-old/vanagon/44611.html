&gt;Other than that the Bus was in a time warp.  Absolutely no rust, the
&gt;rubber seals looked new, the upholstery was covered in clear plastic
&gt;covers (done the week it was purchased).  The headliner was perfect, all
&gt;the trim was intact (tho' the side steps off the front bumper were a
&gt;little bent).  I looked at the odometer ... 61,000 miles (original).
     &lt;snip&gt;
&gt;I still have SEG on my face. ;-)
