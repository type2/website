 Well, here's the scoop: I'm riding Goodyear Regatta touring tires, size
 P195/70R14 _at_ 36 psi all around. Based on the simple shock test mentioned
 above, my shocks seem to be fine. How could I tell if the tires are
 reinforced, or would that even make a difference?
  &gt;&gt;
These tires are not reinforced nor are they even the correct size.  Load
capacity information is stamped on the sidewall.  In addition, when using
passenger car tire(size atarts with the letter&quot;P&quot;, Light truck tires start
with &quot;LT&quot;) you need to derate another 10% according to the feds.  Your tires
are rated at 1332 punds -10% leaves a capacity of 1198 pounds.  4 X 1198 =
4792.  Your vehicles wieght (GVWR) is over 5500 pounds.  Your tire
combination is overloaded indeed.  The Regatta's are available in 215/70 -14.
 These are rated to carry 1554 pounds each.  Even with the derating, they
will safely carry your Van.
