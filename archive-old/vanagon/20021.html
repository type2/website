There is an Oval bug running around these parts.  Don't know what year,
but it has semaphores and teeny-tiny back lights.  Bozo has lowered it
serious negative camber in the rear, big stinger hanging out the back,
and, gasp, had _louvers_ punched in the engine lid!
Also has US Forces in Germany plates!
