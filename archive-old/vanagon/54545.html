Subject: ASI campers

Doe anyone have any experience with ASI camper conversions? I just saw two
Vanagons in a wrecking yard with this conversion. I had been thinking of
grafting a Westfalia top onto my V. but this looks like a possible
alternative. Does anybody have any feelings about these, positive or
negative? Are they still in business? I found a phone number for them in
Vancouver, Washinton, but it had been disconnected

Thanks,
