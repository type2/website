David try Bernie Bergmann in Escondido he has an aftermarket system
for around 150.00 including fan etc. You wouldn't want to bolt the
cooler to the outside as I did, apart from the bugs stray fingers and
rocks also seem to twist the fins....

While it may be true that oil cooling is secondary to its main purpose
and that cool oil cannot makeup for a deficient air cooling system,
the reverse is not true: that is it is a mistake to , rely solely on
the air cooling system to keep your engine at the proper temp.
