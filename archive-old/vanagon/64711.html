Subject:      Re: Shrinking parts

&gt; Is anyone else experiencing shinking plastic trim pieces on their
Westfalia
&gt; interiors.  It seems that around all the openings and the edges of the
&gt; tables and stove/sink covers the edging is slowly getting smaller
exposing
&gt; the plywood.  I was wondering if it is from heat or is time the enemy?
Is
&gt; there anything that can be done to slow the process, or can this material
be
&gt; replaced?  Just trying to keep it looking new for as long as possible.

That  is a common problem. It is probably the temperature cycling that does
it.
You could try filling the gaps with small pieces of trimming using silicone
filler to glue it in place. That would make it look quite acceptable.
