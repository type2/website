Subject: Jap Spark Plugs &amp; Idle prob

Maybe this was covered before but how good are NGK and
Nippendenso plugs?  I heard they give a smoother idle 
and have less &quot;resistance&quot; compared to Bosch.  Anybody
have good or bad experiences with these?  I have a SP
1600 with a 30 PICT 1 and it idles kind of rough.  The 
timing is perfect as with the dwell, etc.  The carb
is a new &quot;rebuilt&quot; job that has a little (very little)
play on the throttle lever.  A buddy said this is 
creating a bit of a air leak.  The engine is also running
a tad rich.......  How can I get a better idle?  Replace
the carb?  I just bought the damn thing.  Oh well.
Any input?  Any replies will be very appreciated.
