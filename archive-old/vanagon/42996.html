Subject: 85 Vanagon Power Steering

I've been lurking for some months now, but I've got a problem and 
could use some advice.  My 85 Westfalia has developed a power 
steering leak from the right side of the steering rack.  There's a 
pool about 3&quot; wide under the bellows on the right side, plus evidence 
of spotting on the suspension from leaks during driving.  The Bentley 
manual implies this is rebuildable, but I seem to remember a thread 
recently where someone said that the parts might not be available any 
longer. 

Can anyone offer suggestions on the best way forward?  Has anyone 
rebuilt one of these recently?  I'm a fair shadetree mechanic, but I 
haven't tackled one of these before.  Is there anyone out there that 
rebuilds them, and if so, how much?  Are rebuilds available anywhere? 
Any recommendations where?  Would appreciate any help I can get.  
Thanks in advance.

Joe Williams
