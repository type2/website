Subject: FS: 1979 VW BUS

It's time to sell my bus-I found a really nice Westy that I've been
looking for.  The bus has high miles, but doesn't drip oil, and gets
22mpg on the highway.  The body is real good, except the rear bumper is
dinged.  It was inspected in May 1994, and should pass today.
I'm asking $2000/obo.
