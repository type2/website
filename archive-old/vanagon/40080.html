Hi Folks:

At the sake of being silly, I thought I'd issue a request for a Bentley
Manual for my 1980 Westy.  When they've come up here from time to time, I've
always procrastinated in responding, then it's been too late.

Checked the local VW dealer today and his price is $145.00.  This seems to
be a bit outrageous, although I do understand that they are expensive.  If
anyone has one that they want to get rid of, they can e-mail me direct with
the details.  Thanks,

Jack Bateman
Oshawa, Ontario
