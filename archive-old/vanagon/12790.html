---------- Forwarded message ---------

I'm very new to this &quot; newsgroup? is this a newsgroup? &quot;,
this isn't my last stupid question, what is BTW ?

And now for the real question, I have a 71 camper that I luv,
it has some serious electrical problems, and I would like to locate
a copy of a schematic for the whole electrical sys.. Muir did a great
job but I need something not so general, and I'm on a student budget. :)

Thanks for any help
