Dear Eric &amp; Laura,

    I don't usually have a lot of Vanagon parts around, but i scout the local
junkyards frequently, and frequently they have Vanagons to part out *cheap*!
     If You e-mail me a list of stuff i would be happy to keep an eye out for
them and let you know how-soon-and-how-much.
     The junkyards in St. Louis usually follow these guidelines:
                               1) If it fits in one hand- $10
                                2) If you need 2 hands to carry it $15-$20
                                3) if it requires the service of the 'ol
Radio Flyer $50-$75
So there you have it! I once bought a pair of perfect &quot;heart&quot; tail lights for
$20 out of one local yard!!!!!  (Got a complete 73 only Westy interior for
$50 out of the same one too!)
So, let me know and maybee i can help!
                                     -Brian

&gt; Does anyone know a place to find cheap Vanagon parts ( ha ha ha).  Nothing
&gt;  is cheap on a Vanagon, of course, but how about something reasonable.
&gt;  Maybe mail order.
