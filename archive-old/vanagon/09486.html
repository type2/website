oops, never mind.  What could you possibly mean, Martha?

I have to say that the chowder was great.  Being the last arrivals around
8pm after suffering 40+ mph winds and rain, it was fantastic to have
delicious hot food and friendly faces greeting us!  Thanks Martha for
looking out for us.

It rained steadily and hard from 9 until midnight friday night.  Tobin
Copely' and David Schwartze' vans were a couple of communal dry gathering
spots during the rain, with various and sordid forms of entertainment. When
the rain stopped Jeff, Bradley, Carol I had a nice walk up the hillside to
see the rain-swollen waterfalls.  It actually stopped raining for quite a
while at that point and we even got the fire started again, I think. 

I think we were all envious of Tobin and Krista and their &quot;Lost in America&quot;
sojourn.  Good luck to them.

John
