Subject: 77 Bus, gas tank removal or cleaning?


A friend has a 77 9 pass, whe WAS going to seel, but instead, she wants 
to get it fixed...problem, from what i've heard, &lt;i have yet to see it, 
should be soemtime this week i get to see it..&gt; is that the gas tank is 
full of &quot;shit&quot; &lt;her words&gt; now, i assume she didnt mean that literally, 
because that wouldbe mroe trouble that i really want to get into, but 
anyway..
is there a way i can get the &quot;stuff&quot; out of the tank w/o pulling the 
tank, other than, say, turning the van on its side and wiggling? with a 
full tank of course! of must i pull the tank? and can this be done w/ the 
engine in, and, since its behind..er..in front of the firewall, how do i 
get that out? and what holds it in? &lt;i DO expect to get paid of rthis 
one, but not sure what to charge yet:)&gt; 

if we have to, we have the tank from a FI'd super we can duck-n-bungee 
above the engien hatch..:)


thanks...
