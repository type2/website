Subject: Re: Winshield seal

I just had my windshield out last week. Seems the seal's &quot;pliability&quot; was
the issue. If its hard, your looking at another one. How hard is hard?
Yeah, well for me if I can push my thumbnail into it, its ok. If my nail
crys out before the seal gives, then IMHO it may be too hard. The Glue with
a special adhesive is either Urethane or Butyl rubber windshield sealant.
Parts Stores carry it. NAPA has both, the nod goes to the Urethane, but
this is a &quot;truck type gasket&quot; ie. the seal itself provides the clamping
power to retain the windscreen.  The adhesive is really just a sealant, so
butyl, which takes longer to &quot;set up&quot;, would pose no disadvantage.

When considering the &quot;Hardness&quot;, remember that the glass can break rather
easy, and it's the &quot;give&quot; in the seal that allows the assembley to fit and
compress into the windshield opening.

BTW, I priced a VISTAR Inc. windshield glass installed, was $180 with a new
gasket. So if your in the ballpark, I'd consider them. Liftime Warrenty and
all that. Usual disclaimers stuff shall apply.

&gt;I am looking at replacing my cracked windshield, and noticed in the Bentley
&gt;book that the rubber seal is glued to the body with special adhesive.
&gt;
&gt;Does this mean that the rubber seal  is not resuseable?
