     Welcome Yug! We appreciate your offer of help, especially since it
     seems you have just the background -Vanagon, VW and Audi- that the
     Transplant Task Force has been looking for!

     If you look through recent archives of the list (do a search on
     &quot;transplant&quot;), you'll see that several of us are interested in
     transplanting larger VAG engines, such as the Audi diesel and gas 5cyl
     (or maybe even the VAG 6cyl diesel that Volvo used), into our already
     watercooled Vanagons of both the regular and Syncro variety.

     Currently, we are working on two questions:

     (1) Because we don't want to raise the engine lid, and our Syncros
     have protective structures under the engine (and we don't want to lose
     ground clearance either), we know we will have to tilt the engines. We
     could make some custom oil pans, but we are also wondering about
     drysumping the engine. Whats involved with this, has it been done with
     Audis (maybe rallye cars?) and how can we investigate this further?

     (2) We know we could do adapter plates, but in general we are
     wondering if there is any commonality in the bolt hole locations
     between VAG bellhousings and VAG engines. Some diesel vanagons have
     been easily converted to later Golf/Jetta engines because it all
     matches up, of course,if you have a diesel and want more power,
     anything is better. What about those of us with 1.9l and 2.1
     wasserboxers, running conventional, automatic, and the Syncro
     transmissions. Is there some way we could get drawings of these?
     Your comments, please.

     Please post to the list. Lots of people out there are following this
     discussion.

     Welcome again, and thanks
