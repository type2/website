    Has anyone installed a trailer hitch on their van?  We tried calling 
    around locally and were told that only extreme light duty( class 1 I 
    think) are available because of the VW specs that the van can't be used 
    for towing.  Has anyone gotten around this?  We are interested in towing 
    a tent trailer now, but were thinking for the future, ie u-haul trailer, 
    etc.  What types of hitches are being used and where are they obtained?  
    Also is there any modifications required or welding to the frame?  Thanks!
    
When I was younger, my dad had an eight-foot
long, home-made wishbone trailer hitch welded
to the bottom of our '63 camper-kitted bus.
We pulled a tent traler and other stuff, and
it worked great.

Until the engine needed to be pulled.  Which 
was impossible.  Which is when Dad sold the bus
to a parts lot.  What a shame...

[ I was 16 when this happened, and not yet a
mechanic in any way, but the story was that 
some little pushrod that ran the fuel pump
broke, with one half falling into the case 
and the other jamming up in the tube it lived
in.  Technical corrections may apply... ]
