Subject: location for august campout?


Voting time!  Here's the suggestions which tricked in as to camp locations for 
our August 25-27 campout (in quotes are listmembers comments about the places). 
 Please let me know of your preferences, or I will assume any of the options 
are fine with you:

1.  Richardson Grove State Park (3 possible campsites: Huckelberry, Madrone, 
and Oak Flat).  These are described in &quot; The Complete Guide to California 
Camping&quot; by Tom Stienstra, pp 75-76 as follows:  &quot;Set in a giant grove of 
costal redwoods, the tallest trees in the world.  Good hiking, sight-seeing, 
but often crowded by tourists in summer months.  Good base camp in wintermonths 
for steelhead fishing in the South Fork of Eel River. Reservations a must in 
summer months through MISTIX by phoning (800) 446-7275.  $10 per night fee.  
Number for Richardson Grove State Park at (707) 946-2311.&quot;
One of our member reported that the campground he saw there looked &quot;really 
nice - with access to the river for sun bathing or swimming.&quot;

2.  Makericher (sp?) campground, north of Ft. Bragg.

3.  Standish Hickey campground in the redwoods.

4.  Trinity Alps (near Weaverville):  &quot;looks a lot like the german alps 
actually, and is not touristy at all - not that we care either way as long as 
we have buses and booze...&quot;

5.  Big Lagoon, about 30 minutes north of Eureka.  This is near Patrick's 
Point State Park, near Agate Beach.


NOW:  =====&gt;  OK, volks - which one calls to you?
