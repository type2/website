Subject: Air bags &amp; VWs

Did anyone hear about an incident in Idaho where a one year was 
killed by the air bag in the passenger seat of a new Jetta?

A very tragic story, made even more maddening because airbags were 
legislated into place with seemingly little research into their 
overall effect on safety. And no doubt, auto makers like VW will pay 
the price in bad press and law suits, not unlike Audi did ten years 
ago. Just one more sad example where politicians mess with things and 
everyone else pays....

(sorry to be so depressing, guys...)
