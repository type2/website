Okay,

	This weekend I rebuilt my carb (28 PICT). Berryman's ChemDip -
Nectar of the Gods!

	I started the bus back up, made some adjustments, and took it for a spin. 
It ran a lot stronger!

	Then the wierdness (and this was happening before I rebuilt the carb)
As the engine gets warm, the bus loses power.  I took off nice and strong,
and by the time I got 1/2 mile or so, it was already getting weak.   By
weak I mean there is no power - I feel like I should get out and walk along 
side to make it easier on the bus!  It will take 5-10 seconds to get 
enough speed to go from 1st to 2nd gear, and when you get there, you kinda
wonder if you should'nt have bothered, as the engine just groans under the
strain.  7 year old kids on bikes are passing me!  No, REALLY!

	This is a consistent problem.  I've been debating putting new
pistons and cylinders on, but I'm wondering if I should even bother.  Is
there any way to tell what condition the bottom end of a motor is in.  I
don't want to spend all that cash only to find that the cam/crank/etc is
toast. 

I also get puffs of black when I rev the motor.  Not really smoke, but
black sooty stuff shoots out, and its kinda cloudy, a little.

BTW - there are not any expensive noises, per St. Muir.  At idle, it
sounds fine, pero lo no tienes huevos!  (but it has no balls)

Another nugget of info.  When I put fresh ait heater boxes on a while
back, there was a pile of dirt about 6&quot; high between #3 &amp; #4.  Seriously!
We had to chisel it out.  Strangely, the compression on #3 was 115, #4
was 103, and 1 &amp; 2 were 92 each... Hmmm.    I re-torqued the head on 1 &amp; 2,
but I haven't re-checked the compression.

BTW - the brakes are still wacko.  Any ideas?

Is it pistons and cylinders?   Head work?  Whole new motor?
