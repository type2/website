Eric said
That's swell, but as bus owners it's kind of not too good to mount bikes to
the back, thus impeding engine access.

I say-
There is actually a pretty cool mount I saw that fits on a standard trailer
hitch that swings backward, allowing full access to the rear (of the bus,
that is).
There is also one that fits on the spare tire.
