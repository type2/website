Subject: Need help separating jugs from heads

Hi all,

I decided to pull the heads off my  84 Westy.  This is sort of like playing
high stakes poker with lousy cards.  Seems like you get sucked in a little
further after each round.  Pulled the engine last weekend which went pretty
well.  Thought it would be easier to work on an engine stand.  Tried to pull
heads last night but lo and behold the jugs on 3 of 4 cylinders remain stuck
to the head.  I haven't pulled the jugs past the piston rings but the lower
seals have been disrupted.

My question is this: should I remove the wrist pins and jugs?  And if so,
what's the best way to do this without the special VW tool to pull the pins
out?  Any help much appreciated.

Garrick Chang
84 Westy
