Subject: Re: How to change ATF in 90 Vanagon

Hi All,

Just done this in my '85.  The flush deal at local shop was going to run
$100, so DIY.  I got a new filter/seal kit for &lt;$25.  The filler pipe is
long since fused onto the pan, so I undid the 4 13mm pan bolts and let the
ATF drain into a large tub. Then removed the 10mm bolt holding the filler
tube to block and dropped it all. No need to jack the van, it works.  Before
this I scrubbed the area clean with GUNK etc until it wiped clean and dry,
no dirt even close by.  Spread some newspaper around first too. 

The ATF was surprisingly clear and 'unburnt' but I have no idea of the
history. Crew has 206K kms on it.  Trans was/is working perfectly anyhow.
Cleaned up the pan and reinstalled, using old gasket.  Yup, old gasket.
Check for rust around the edges. Then filled up with 3.5litres of fresh
Castrol Dex-III/Mercon.  No problems, no noticeable improvement, not that I
was expecting any.

I'll do this again in about a month, but using the new gasket and filter.
Figure this way any crud that does get loosened will get trapped in the old
filter, and I should be able to get the torque converter somewhat flushed
too.  I also wanted to go slow on the fresh ATF as I was warned about brake
band slippage and other problems when new ATF goes into an old trans.
Fingers crossed.  Also did the diff gear oil, less worries there.
