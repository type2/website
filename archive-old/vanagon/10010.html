I too saw the 4x4 VeeWee (VW) in Munich.  It is called a Synchro.
It is definitely factory.

They also make a Synchro Vanagon (I've actually seen these in the
US).  A former roommate calls it his &quot;Dream Car&quot;.


One of the 4x mags recently had their favorite 4x4's.  One was titled
&quot;Best use of a Vega&quot; that had a Vega on a 4x frame.  Being a former
Vega owner, I whole-heartedly agree with their title.
