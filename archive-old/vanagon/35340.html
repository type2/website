Subject: cheap Syncro Vanagon Tires?

A ? for all you learned Volks-

I read your posts re tires, listened to all sorts of car/VW people off-line,
and did extensive shopping.  I learned more about tires than I wish to
know...  and still question my decision! 

I switched from the POs Michelin MXL 205s to 185R14C 8PR, 100/102P all-season
blackwall 8 ply tubeless steel belted radials.  Whew!  They're 40,00 mi.
warranty, made by Kelly but called Jupiters YP-821.  I hope you'll agree that
I got a bargain _at_ $43 ea. plus mounting, balancing, tax and Merchant's &quot;Tire
Protect Policy&quot;- repair/rotate/balance for life of tire for $64.87 total.
 Trusting that any Merchants will honor repairs, I opted to keep the big 205
for a spare until a cheap185 surfaces.  I abused my previous 4x4 truck
off-road, but intend to give my Tugboat TLC, plowing through snow and mud
only when necessary.

OK- where have I gone wrong?  May I be excited with my new sneakers?
