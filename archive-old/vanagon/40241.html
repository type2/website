Subject: New WWW of VWoGer 

Hi all,

Yesterday I was just surfing and discovered that VWoGer has a new web page at

www.vw-online_dot_de

Everybody who has not yet discovered it can TRAIN his/her German language 
there!

But the most amazing thing was that on one page they also mentioned the 
homepages of the top-of-the-world-tour and Thom's page. If you do not 
believe it, check it at

www.vw-online_dot_de/german/vwprivat/privat.htm

CONGRATULATIONS to both of you!
