     That sounds very similar, haven't received a Griot's catalog in some time; 
     probably because I never ordered anything-too expensive- but nice to look 
     at.

   I'd noticed some silver-colored adhesive insulating pads in 
   a Griot's Garage catalog, unfortunately they are out and do 
   not expect more. I wondered how well the &quot;Roadkill&quot; stuff in 
   the VW magazines would help insulate ye olde Transporter?
     
&gt;     trucks, big rigs, or tractors, as in tractor trailer.  Anyway, this
&gt;     material was used along with an adhesive which was used between the sheet 
&gt;     metal panels and the frame of the vehicle.  This combination was said to 
&gt;     reduce vibration and noise considerably.
&gt;
&gt;     The foam was available in different thicknesses from, as I recall, a thin 
&gt;     sheet, maybe 1/16&quot; to 1/2-5/8&quot; or thicker.
&gt;
&gt;     I'll keep looking for a source.
