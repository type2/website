Subject: 87 vanagon: sources for new windshield?


Hello all,

My 87 van has 136 kmi on it and the wind shield is looking 
sandblasted--especially annoying driving at night, or into the sun:  all 
kinds of little rainbow refractions (any trippy people wanna trade a clear, 
new windshield?).

What sources of good quality/price windshields have been found by list 
members?

How difficult is the install?  Recommended to be done professionally?

Thanks,
porter_fred%pax9_at_mr.nawcad.navy_dot_mil
relax and spin
