Where is this &quot;divider between the driver's seat&quot;?  Between the driver's 
and passenger's seat up front?  Seems like a really odd place.  Behind 
the driver's seat, in front of the metal bulkhead?  Seems too small 
there, just enough room for the tire chains, folding shovel, tow rope, 
jumper cables and a few litres of oil in my '76 westy.

I'm guessssing you're talking about the space directly behind the 
driver's seat, behind the metal bulkhead.  What's the cabinetry layout 
like on your uncle's bus?  In my westy this space is occupied by a 
cabinet originally designed for the spare tire, but which I use to hold 
our propane camp stove and a 10 lb. propane tank.  The space available in 
the cabinet is roughly 2 ft. deep, 1 ft. wide, and maybe 2 1/2 ft. high 
(just guessing from memory here...).  I've often thought it would be cool 
to shoehorn a small RV furnace in there to free up my engine compartment 
for aux. batteries (I've got an engine compartment mounted BN-4 gas 
heater now and it kinda crowds things a bit and generally freaks me out...).

If I'm thinking along the right lines here, what model is your uncle 
using, and how much did it cost?  Installation fairly straight-forward?  
BTU rating?  If it's in a different location entirely, then please 
correct me and clarify where/how it was installed.  Non-hook up heat is a 
real interest of mine, since we almost always camp in locations where no 
services at all are available, so self-sufficient heat sources are needed.

Thanks!
