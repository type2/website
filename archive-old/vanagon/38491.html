Subject: Fuel Injection Question

I've recently bought a 1800cc type IV engine that supposedly runs.  It has the 
fuel injection still on it, but someone has put a 009 Bosch distributor on it.
Will this work?  I thought that the injectors needed to get a impulse from
the distributor.  The guy said that the engine used to run, then he had it
worked on.  

Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks

See ya
