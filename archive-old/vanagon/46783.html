Subject: still resurrecting 65 camper

BRAKE JOB (HA)

today i took advantage of a friend (with a good back)'s visit to get him to
bang loose the rear axle nuts.   however, the drums are stuck, so i decided
to soak the spindles in oil, and let them sit a few.  he was impressed with
the poundimiform to knock the nuts loose :)

while i was waiting for him to show, i tried unsuccessfully to get the
interior lights working.  i dont think there was juice to the light fixtures,
though.  found out than wire wool is good for getting the brown house paint
off the dash.   hope it wont scratch the white vw paint, though.
the horn doesnt work.  i tested it with my battery charger.  then i went
through my pile of (8)horns, and the only one that worked was an early 6V
one, with the screw terminals.   but it went on with a larger nut and stud,
and wouldn't go on the horn bracket.   so i unscrewed the halved, and saw no
reason for it not to work - it was shiny clean inside.  ??

looked for a 65 style rear hatch in my pile o doors, but no luck.  ill have
to put a window in it (did i mention the rear window was smashed?)

on to the front brakes.  right side first.   loosened the nuts (no lock
washer in sight) and jacked it up.   bearings look okay.   wheel drags a bit
spinning, but the king pins are okay.   i pulled and wiggled, but  the drum
did not want to come off.    stuck on the shoes.  and ouch- it was worn to
the metal on the inside of the tire.     Don't even suggest loosening the
stars, as we are talking rust city here folks.

after much banging with a hammer (it takes a lot less time to write about it
than to do it), taking off the rim and more banging, i prevailed.   the shoes
are good, the wheels cylinders garbage.   the tie rod, too, garbage.  it was
bent.   i like this - i hope this is why they stopped driving it.  i always
wonder when someone says that they just parked it.
it seems to have sat more than two years by the rust.

i have new cylinders, but unfortunately the rubber line is toast too, and i
dont think i have one.   make shopping list.   need wiper motor bracket too.
 (the pivots are broken off).  maybe ill just put in a 67 2 speed motor while
im at it (the bus is already 12V)

i got out the grease gun and pumped lots of new grease into the suspension.
  then left that side on the stand and went to the other side.   

the drivers tie rod was straight, and the tire not as worn down.  but i
couldn't get the drum off :(.  greased that side, and soaked the carb in
yucky carb cleaner.  the crucial passage is coming clear.   more tomorrow.   

working through the type 2 karma,

clara
