&gt;In the January issue of Automotive Engineering, page 80 there is a picture of 
&gt;the something called the Volkswagen MPV.  It looks like the Honda minivan, it 
&gt;said to have engine options of a 2.8 liter V6 and a diesel.  The concept 
&gt;vehicle has a five cylinder direct-injection turbodiesel.  Next to the picture 
&gt;of the Volkswagen is an illustration of a Renault Espace F1 concept, and below 
&gt;that is a picture of something called a Ford Galaxy? which is supposed to be 
&gt;built in collaboration with Volkswagen in Portugal.  The Galaxy is identical 
&gt;to the Volkswagen MPV.

This is that minivan I mentioned a long while ago. It's called a Sharran 
(ughh! What a name) and, apart from the badges, its basically the same as a 
Ford. They are due to go on sale here later this year.
