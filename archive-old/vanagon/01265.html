Subject: Type 4 engine running hot...

Hello all!! First the good news - the T4 engine in my SO's 73 camper is
running great! Good pull, and real smooth. Now the prob - It's running
real hot.. There's a little smoke coming off of it after it sits for a few
minutes after a good drive, but it appears to be coming off of the heat
exchangers and when the front oil seal went, oil got everywhere so it may
just be residue (we scrubbed it today; let's see how that goes).. What
could cause the engine to be running hot?? The flaps seem to be working
all right, but I mat pull off the sheetmetal to check this out. The fan is
OK. Could the crankshaft endplay being too tight cause this?? The reason I
asked was that (please don't flame me) I didn't realize that it was
something that needed adjustment as long as all parts were within specs.
How do you measure this anyhow?? I now know that it is changed by the
little shims (I put the 3 I found back when reassembling).. If this is too
tight, could this make the engine run too hot? Anything else to check? (I
know all tuneup stuffs is OK - I had my guru go over it all when he put
the Kadrons in)..

Thanks, and don't flame me too bad...

Yours in asbestos,

Jamie
