Subject:      87 GL surges. . .

        I've been having a problem with my '87 GL weekender in regards to
something that can only be described as &quot;surging&quot;. In 1st and 2nd gears I've
noticed that there are power surges of some kind and the ride isn't at all
smooth. Unfortunately now it's getting worse to the point where every once
in a while I'll be in a stop light and start going forward in 1st but the
thing will just lug down and kind of . . . sputter. Eventually, after about
10 or 15 seconds I'll regain power.

WHAT IS MY PROBLEM?

            If a parsley farmer is sued, can they garnish his wages ?
