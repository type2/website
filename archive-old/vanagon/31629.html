Subject: exhaust manifold leak fix?

I know this isn't VW related but I thought I'd ask...

I have a '62 t-bird that has an exhaust manifold leak do to the
gasket crumbling after 30 years.  What can I put in that crack
that will withstand the high 1,000 + temps.?  JB weld will only
go to 600degrees.  Help!!!

Martin
