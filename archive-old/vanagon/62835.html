Subject: Missing Bentley Pages

My Bentley is coming apart, which I can live with, but I've lost 2 pages
that I need, and I'm hoping someone can copy and fax them to me. It's the
manual up to '87, but one from '86 on should be fine. It's pages 19.9
through 19.12, the cooling system section.
Can anyone help me?
Thanks
