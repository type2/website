I have the Mcode list from the latest NEATO newsletter, and 377
isn't on it.  101 is &quot;Snow tires, only with bus with M100&quot; (which is &quot;without
VW emblem&quot;)  Can you verify if this could be right?  130 is &quot;Type 24
without sunroof and roof windows&quot;  Sounds like a microbus with
deluxe trim--does yours have corner windows?

yup -  61 w/ corner windows (all 63 and earlier type 24s had corner windows,
after 64 thein 64 the rear hatch was widenened and there was no room for
corner windows anymore, what a shame)no sunroof or roof windows,  but came
w/vw emblem and safaris., as well as the trim on belt line and clock,  and
the cloth  headliner still resonably intact.    I found for it correct front
snd rear bumpers with trim ( it came with a piece of wood on the front,
nothing in back),  15&quot; beauty rims for the wheels,  chrome ash tray,  correct
inside front door handles (chrome),  and two missing interior panels.  Also
found rubber for the safari windows, got new glass cut, bought an NOS safari
wiper pivot at an excessive price,  yay - working original German safari
windows!  It has had almost 20,000 miles on it since we put it on the road in
September of 94,   including two long road/camping trips.
