[Jack talks about renting a bearing puller to replace his rabbit's bearings]

I recently had my front wheel bearings replace in my rabbit GTI and truck.
I had it done at a vw repair shop (the first time I had someone else work on
them) where they used the bearing puller/installer you had mentioned.  It took
them about 45 minutes to replace a bearing.  There is still quite a bit of 
work to do even with the puller.  If I had done it myself it would probably
taken me all day.  It also helps to have the car up on a lift.  The best thing
about it that the entire housing does not have to be taken off.  The labor was
$40 for each replacement.  I supplied the bearings which are about $23 each.
