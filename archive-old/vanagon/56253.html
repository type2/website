&gt; Really had to respond to this one!
&gt; 
&gt; My '91 Westy Greta - who I lost to an engine fire - was purchased 3/30/95 with
&gt; 10,600 one-owner miles on her. She had been owned by a German stockbroker who
&gt; collected nice cars. She took me on camping trips to Canada in the summer of
&gt; '95 and 7 weeks west to 13 National Parks and many other wild lands in the
&gt; summer of '96. When she 'died' this past Nov 15th she had only experienced
&gt; 25,065 miles. It does break my heart to think of all the places she missed out
&gt; on!
&gt; 
&gt; I am in the process of buying another '91 Westy (currently nameless) who has
&gt; been owned by an older couple as their third Westy. This one has 28,500 miles
&gt; on her, but I know she has made several trips to Montana to visit family.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope to keep her miles low but quality - that is she, nor none of her pre-
&gt; dicessors, will not be my daily driver. She is purely for pleasure and quality
&gt; time on the back roads and scenic byways. She will be driven for antiquing,
&gt; photography adventures, and camping trips. And when she leaves me - I will try
&gt; to insure that she goes home with another who truly cares about her welfare
&gt; as much as I do. For Westies deserve the very best of care.

Nice! I feel exactly the same for my '91 Westie.
