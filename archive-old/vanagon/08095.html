&gt;For the friend with the '87, any solution to his problem.  I know awhile
&gt;back there was a thread on oil coolers.  At the time it didn't sound like
&gt;a project I wanted to get into!!  If there are two sensors for oil pressure,
&gt;which ones are telling us what?  Where does one attach an aftermarket oil
&gt;pressure gage?

the one sensor on the backside of the engine (near the waterpump) is the
low-pressure sensor. there is another sensor, between the left side (cylinder
3 &amp; 4) pushrod tubes, that measures the high pressure. unfortunately, this
second sensor is the place you want to install an aftermarket pressure gauge.
unfortunate, because there isn't enough room in there to put the VDO dual-
sender. :(  the single sender might fit, but then you don't have the idiot
light on the dash (only the guage will work).

an alternative is to put some sort of pipe/hose into the sender hole, and
mount the VDO dual-sender somewhere else. me personally, i'm not toooo crazy
about this idea because i don't want a big hose down there bumping/rubbing
on my pushrod tubes. and i don't like the idea of a short little pipe with
with the heavy sender on the end of it ... seems to me that it might break
too easily (and all my oil run out very quickly).

the air-cooled engines were really easy to mount the sender, but the
water-cools present a problem.
