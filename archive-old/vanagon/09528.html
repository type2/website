&gt; Voting time!  Possible dates for West Pretour Orgy # 2:

We're already voting.  Sheesh!  I haven't seen very many people
discussing it yet.  

&gt; 
&gt; March 17-19
&gt; March 24-16&lt;---??????? (you probably mean the 26th ?)

&gt; 
&gt; Register your preferences with me, and I'll try to keep track of
&gt; them.  

&gt;Those failing to respond will get no beer.

Hah!  And what army is going to stop me!  ;P
