Hi! We are anxiously expecting the celebration of this event were you can
compete in 50 different categories. For busses they set up about 10 cate-
gories. I will take my Westy to compete in the category of &quot;Best Bus Rest-
oration&quot;. The show is sponsored by the good friends of Volky Performance,
Coamo Volky Auto Parts, Eurobahn Imports and the guru of Pre-68 Busses,
Harold Martinez. In this show all types of VWs can compete. There is a
special category for Karmann-Ghias, Things, Bajas, Vintage VWs, Custom VWs
and even there is category called &quot;The Wrecked VW of the Day&quot;. I hope to see
many Westies this year. I'll keep you informed.

Peace to all,
Angel
78 Caribbean Westy
