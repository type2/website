Subject: Re: 81 Vanagon

The fuel injection system on the '81 Vanagon is essentially independent
from the ignition system.  That is, although the ECU takes some input
from the ignition system (timing of spark) there is no &quot;management&quot; of
ignition going on.  So, I'd think you could use the Hall effect
distributor, coil, etc. with carburators.

One part you won't need if you go to carbs is the idle stabelizer - the
small black box on the left forward side of the engine bay with two 
round connectors coming out the bottom.  This sends signals to the ECU:
since you'll have no ECU, no need for the stabilizer.

Disconnect the two plugs from the idle stabilizer and connect them
together.  Then unscrew the idle stabilizer and send it to me!! :)

&gt; I just bought a 81 Vanagon (its a California model) here in Detroit.
&gt; 
&gt; The FI is not working and is missing a few parts.  I've got a two barrel 
&gt; Solex from a 914 I'm going to use for now any suggestions?  Looks fairly 
&gt; straight forward.  
&gt; 
&gt; What about the distributor?  Will the electronic ignition work without 
&gt; the FI. It looks like it will but ???.  Any suggestions on changing the
&gt; the distributor?
&gt; 
&gt; The van is a camper with a pop up top the body is great.  It needs a new 
&gt; windshield but that can wait till spring.
&gt; 
&gt; I would just like to get it going for now so any suggestions welcome.
