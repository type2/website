Subject: Official Sanction of the VW T-Shirt

I just want to add my voice to the cacaphony about the T-Shirts.  They're 
wonderful!  Definitely get one or more.  Consider sending Mr. Palmer a 
tip for his effort as it's a really nice T-shirt and he's going out of 
his way to get involved.

(I can't believe I'm encouraging people to wear t-shirts that advertise 
the list thus making it more likely that the list will grow EVEN BIGGER
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHH!!!!!!!)

513 and counting.
