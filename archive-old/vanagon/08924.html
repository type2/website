&gt; &gt;This morning when I went to start up the Westy, the starter did its usual
&gt; &gt;rrr rrr rrr (it is minus 15 degrees Celsius outside). Now my question is this:
&gt; &gt;someone mentioned that unless the Main Computer receives a minimum
&gt; &gt;voltage the engine will not fire; does this include a signal to the
&gt; &gt;starter as well?. In other words if the voltage of the battery is below
&gt; &gt;the acceptable threshold will the starter turn (assuming it has enough
&gt; &gt;cranking amps to do so) even though the engine will not fire? TIA - DC --
&gt; 
&gt; nope. the low-voltage thing about the computer doesn't affect the starter.
&gt; in fact, the starter can keep on grinding away until the voltage IS too low
&gt; for the computer to work. you might want to thing about that BIG mutha wire
&gt; to run between the battery ground strap and the starter mounting bolt(s) ...
&gt; it helped my 80 vanagon a lot. made the starter spin over a lot quicker and
&gt; it didn't rrr rrr rrr even in about 10 F (above) in Rhode Island one
&gt; christmas. it's a bitch to run a wire that big (and maybe a slightly smaller
&gt; one would work), but it did help.

Joel: when you say &quot;big mutha wire&quot; what size gauge are we talkin' -
4,6,8? TIA - DC --
