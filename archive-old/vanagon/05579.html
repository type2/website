&gt;&gt; it seems unlikely that an AWD Vanagon w/o engine mods would be able to pull
&gt;&gt; away from a &quot;fast car&quot; on a ramp, ground condition notwithstanding, unless
&gt;&gt; the other driver wasn't interested in playing, or was a weenie driver...

&gt;living in milmaukee, almost all of the people in fast cars can only go
&gt;fast in a straight line, and totally panic at the slightest hint of a
&gt;turn, especially in the wet.  I have however encountered a very wel
&gt;driven carrera 4 that was going about 70 into a clover and exited at a
&gt;much greater speed.  he left foot braked al the way through and just
&gt;drove away from me!  turns out he s a formula ford driver.  Alas, being
&gt;(only) an improved touring driver i could not catch him

it is amazing to me how few people seem to go out and find out how to drive
THEIR cars ... particularly the big LARBs (Large American Road Barge). they
all seem to do exactly the same thing down here: while in a straight line,
they floor it. but give them a little bit of a curve and the brake lights
come on and stay on. seems like they have to exit at half the posted
recommended speed ... and can't merge worth a flip on a curved entry ramp.

meanwhile, me and the bus are struggling just as hard as we can ... :)
i've been able to gain almost a dozen car lengths on some fat cat in a
cadillac in a clover-leaf. well, what laughingly passes for a clover-leaf
down here anyway.

i think it's the coffee.

they don't want to spill it all over their carpet. ;)
