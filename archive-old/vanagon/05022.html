Subject: RE- nicknames for generatio

GatorMail-Q                   RE: nicknames for generations
Joel sez:

&gt;the first generation was called Bulli (which had something to do with a
&gt;german slang name for an ox or draught-horse (that's work-horse to you
&gt;Yanks).

&gt;the second generation was called Bus or Bread-loaf (cause it looked like
&gt;that dancing loaf of bread in the commercials) or Bay-Window (because of
&gt;the huge single piece windshield).

&gt;the third generation was called Vanagons (cause of a bunch of stupid
&gt;advertising twits) or Bricks (cause of the squared-off shaped resemblance
&gt;to said construction material).

In keeping with the &quot;B&quot; theme (Bulli, Bus/Bread-loaf/Bay-Window, Brick)
I'd like to toss out Barn, as in, &quot;as big as a &quot;, &quot;broad side of a&quot; etc.
Once, there were &quot;bahn-burners,&quot; now there are Barn-burners...

UrineVan...yeah, right!...   :-)
