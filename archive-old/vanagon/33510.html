Subject: Solutions-- 34Pict3 with 009 distributor (long)....

When I started having timing problems with my engine, ('71 1600, 34pict3
carb with 009 distributor) I couldn't figure out the problem.  Numerous
people told me that a 009 mechanical advance distributor will not time
properly with a 34pict3, as a 34pict3 uses a vaccum advance to retard
timing on the #3 cyl.

After much research and anxiety, I decided to replace my ignition with a
Jacobs Bug Pak.  The unit cost me $250.  I must say that the investment has
paid off.  For the most part, my bus now runs as smooth as silk.

There are still a few tune up procedures I am having trouble with.  Now
that my ignition system was running fine, I knew that my carb still needed
adjustment.  I was still getting a SLIGHT (really tiny--comes out more when
engine is cold) flat spot, and it was easy to tell that the electronic
ignition was doing it's best to correct it.  So I went to the library and
dug up as much info as possible on carbs and how they work.  I also
received my 1993 issue of HotVWs that has an article in it on how to tune
up your 34pict3.

IDLE ADJUSTMENT


If you are having trouble tuning up your 34pict3's idle controls, then the
first thing to check before all else is the throttle plate.  If the
throttle plate is not fully closed at idle, then you are not really using
the IDLE CIRCUIT in the carb--rather you are using the PROGRESSIVE CIRCUIT.
(The throttle plate is attached to the throttle lever which is attached to
the accelerator cable.)
An oversimplification of this is illustrated below.

To make sure that the throttle plate is fully closed when your foot is off
the accelerator pedal, you need to adjust the THROTTLE PLATE(lever)
ADJUSTMENT SCREW.  This adjustment is in different places on different
busses, so you will have to consult your service manual to find out where
it is.  On my '71 bus, the screw is attached to the throttle lever, and the
procedure for correcting it is as follows...

1.) turn the throttle plate adjustment screw all the way out, until it no
longer
    touches the fast idle cam.
2.) turn the screw in so that it JUST TOUCHES the fast idle cam.
3.) turn the screw 1/4 turn in more.

The throttle plate should fully close, but not stick.  This procedure is
right out of the service manual.  I did not fully understand the logic
behind this adjustment at first until I learned more about carbs, and then
realized that this was a very important adjustment!!  Make sure its done
right!

THE DREADED FLAT SPOT

Here's where things get tricky.  When you put your foot on the gas, and the
throttle is wide open (WOT), pressure* in the intake manifold reaches
atmospheric, and the air/fuel mixture goes instantly LEAN.  This is where
you get the flat spot.  To keep the mixture combustable, the accelerator
pump shoots RAW GAS from a nozzle into the manifold to richen the air/fuel
mixture.

              * air pressure is what makes your carb work.
                The intake manifold is what supplies the air/fuel mixture
                to your cylinders, and although may cause problems during cold
                weather, etc., it is one of the LAST places to look at for flat
                spots, etc.  :)


The 34pict3 has an accelerator pump nozzle (it looks like the faucet to
your kitchen sink) right over the throttle plate.  You can gain access to
this pump by taking the top off your carb.  You can take the top off your
carb while the carb is still attached to the engine...it's not very
difficult at all.

This is what I found out from HotVWs that the service manual did not
mention: the nozzle has to be positioned over the throttle plate GAP, not
the throttle plate itself.  When I reassembled my carb after cleaning it, I
positioned this nozzle so that it was centered over the throttle plate.  I
now have to go and move it towards the edge.  This in itself will logically
give better accelerating performance.

As far as performance with the 009 distributor goes, things get a little
tricky from here. The dudes at HotVWs used a small diameter drill bit
(.050) and a pin vise (a hand held drill, available at hobby stores) to
ream out the opening to the accelerator pump nozzle (the thing I was just
talking about).  This allowed for a thicker stream of gas to shoot into the
manifold, and thus richened up the lean spot better.  They also adjusted
the BELL CRANK lever afterwards. The bell crank is attached to the
accelerator pump lever, on the right side of the carb.  It's got a + and -
sign on it, and you adjust it with a screwdriver.  Muir says to leave it
be, but I had to disagree with him when I adjusted mine...


They also reamed the auxillary idle jet with a .050 drill bit (one thing
HotVWs doesn't tell you is to use these with caution, as they break
easily!), located next to the pilot jet, both of which are just to the
right and below the automatic choke.  The auxillary idle jet is the smaller
of the two jets (I mean SMALL).

I have yet to try this procedure, but the folks at HotVWs seem to think it
did the trick.  I am just about to go finish tuning up Lola, so we'll see
if all this reasearch did the trick.  At any rate, I'm a little wiser about
carbs in general.

I hope this helps anyone who is having the same trouble as I am.
