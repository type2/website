Subject: 90 Westy Skipping....Continued

Howdy,

     A couple of months ago I posted for help on my 90 Westy that would skip
and hesitate when first started after sitting for an extended period.
 Several great suggestions on where to look for problems: Coolant temp.
sensor, Idle stabilizer valve, O2 sensor and the throttle position switch.
 Unfortunately I have not had the time to trouble shoot the problem.  

    This morning I ran the van for the first time in 11 days with some new
symptoms. It seem to run fine for the first couple of miles, then at the
second or third stop light it started skipping and hesitating worst then it
ever has.  It even started backfiring, I think, and then quite.  Could/Would
start, and could rev to 3000RPM, but would die even with the pedal held in
position or even to the floor.  Would slowly start to back off on the RPM's
and would quite, with the pedal held in position or to the floor.  Did this
5-6 times and then it magically went away and ran fine.  I did notice that
when it finally decided to run that the temp gauge was half way to it normal
running position.  The condition is getting worst.  I never had it hesitate
or quite like this before.

FWIW, the temp sensor was replaced in march of this year, but that does'nt
mean that it's not bad.  I don't know it the latest symptoms should lead me
to look at one of the above mentioned solutions first or could it be
something else ?  If anyone has any ideas on what to look at first, I would
appreciate it.  I should get off my ass and solve the problem because I'm
taking the van to the Outter banks of North Carolina for thanksgiving.

    One side note, I recently subcribed to a list for Volvo owners, you think
the Vanagon _at_lenti list has traffic you should see this list.  Twice as much
as the Vanagon list.

Thanks in Advance,

Scott Curtis
