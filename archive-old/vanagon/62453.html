Subject: Submersible Water Pump 83.5 Westfalia

The blue, German, submersible water pump for the fresh water system of my
83.5 Westfalia gave up.  I can get the $49 real item from Euro-American
parts, but I see from a search of the archives that a $10 &quot;bilge pump&quot;, I
believe purchased from Wal-Mart, would do handily.  Does anyone else have
other ideas or successes, or can provide more details?  Please copy me
directly if you post your response to the server, as I'm not keeping up
every day.  I'll also cruise the archives in several days.

Thanks,
