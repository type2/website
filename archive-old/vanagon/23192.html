Subject: RE: Popping 4th gears

On the subject of the bungee corded shifters....I seem to recall this problem
in my '69 camper and I was told by someone who was a respected mechanic that
one reason for my tranny's early (&lt;&gt;100K miles) was that I did not get up
enough revs/speed for 4th gear. The manual says van must be going at least
35 MPH for 4th. I used that as a mantra from that day on and never had another
tranny die on me (yet) ....don't shift until 35...don't shift until 35...
it just so happens that 35 is the speed at which I could shift into 4th gear
without using the clutch.
