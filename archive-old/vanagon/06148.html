&gt;i doubt that anybody would be interested in even a partial explination of 
&gt;the physics involved, so i'll just say that the shape of the rear of the 
&gt;bus needs more attention than the front for any significant change in the 
&gt;resistance to moveing through the air. 
&gt;
&gt;look at dolphins, 747's, the classic tear drop shape, submarines (like 
&gt;the soviet alpha class).
&gt;
&gt;the shapes all have a blunt front and a long tapered tail.
&gt;
&gt;this prevents the low pressure area in the rear from forming.

Then why are the tails the big thing on 911s?  I had a turbo tail on mine
for a while, and I noticed the biggest difference about 90MPH.  I now
have a ducktail, and while it is an improvement over stock, its not quite
the same.  I put the ducktail on for aesthetic reasons - the turbo taile
looked funky since I only have 7&quot; flares...
