Subject: Re: A &quot;Tandem List Mailer&quot;


&gt;I just love quoting myself.  Actually, I seem to send my email
&gt;before I finish my thought.  Anyway, I wrote:

 &lt;snip for brevity&gt;

&gt;Let's round out this idea a little.  Both remailers would need to maintain
&gt;all 3 subscriber lists, and would have to forward un/subscription requests
&gt;to each other to keep the lists synchronized.  The protocol would be something
&gt;like this:

 &lt;snip some more for brevity&gt;

&gt;Everything clear?  Anything missing?  It seems to me this is the real
&gt;goal of splitting the list: reduce the needed remailer resources, and
&gt;at the same time, avoid splitting up a very cohesive group of people.

&gt;-Rodney

This would place more demand on the owners of both lists, as they would
constantly be required to monitor subscribe/unsubscribe requests, as well
as remain in constant email content.  Also placing a heavier demand on the
subscriber by forcing him/her to remember where to put which address.
To automate this would require some sort of script on both systems(since
both lists are not at UMN) that polls each list each day/week/hour whatever
for a list of subscribers on each list comparing both lists, eliminating
unique addresses, and determining whether the remaining addresses are in
digest mode or not.  I foresee many CPU cycles being wasted, when the
individuals who choose to be on both lists can use their delete key to
eliminate the duplicate messages.

Cheers,
