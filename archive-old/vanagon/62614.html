Subject: Ceiling Glue

I am trying to repair the velcro inside cover for the skylight on my '91
Westy.  The velcro strips have come loose from the ceiling of the van.  I
went to the hardware store yesterday but couldn't find a glue that looked
appropriate.  Can anyone recommend the best glue to use in this application
(I believe the ceiling has a foam coating and the velcro strip is nylon(?)
backed so it would be foam to nylon)?

Thanks
