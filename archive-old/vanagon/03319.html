Subject: Re: Overheating

It means you take it to a radiator shop, hand it to them, and
say, &quot;rod this out, please&quot;.   :-)

They actually take the rad apart and shove a metal rod thru it to
physically remove the crud.  In my case it was black gooey crud
not white.  


It made a HUGE difference where the temp gauge needle sits.
