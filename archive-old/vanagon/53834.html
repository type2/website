I see all these posts for vanagons and synchro vanagons for sale, almost
always may miles away from me here in southern Arizona.  I will go week
after week without seeing even one vanagon for sale in the Tucson, Arizona
newspaper.  After living and working as a vw mechanic in Oregon most of my
life, am now in Arizona.  Compared to the northwest, southern Arizona is
definitely NOT volkswagen country.

The prices I see on this list seem very low compared to what they are here
in Arizona, when they are available!  Are these nice vanagons or has the
rust problem of the eastern states really set in to these vanagons?  Just
curious.
