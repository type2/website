Subject: Re: carrying extra gas/f(sort of)


&gt;
&gt;You know those polyethelyene carriers for water which are collapsable?
&gt;I know that these are not suitable/safe for carrying gasoline, but am
&gt;wondering if something like it exists made out of some other material.  It's
&gt;the collapsable feauture I like - the fact that you could reduce space
&gt;when not carrying gas.  Anyone know of such a thing?

&gt;Anyway, if anyone has heard of such an animal, or could invent one, please
&gt;let me know!
&gt;
&gt;/martha (he/she who dies with the most camping toys wins)

In this case, &lt;&lt;...burns with the most...&gt;&gt;
