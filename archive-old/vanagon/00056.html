Subject: Re: Any A/C Secrets?

I have a factory A/C videotape used to train the VW mechanics at the dealers
on how to properly maintain the A/C system. It is short but enriches your
life...that is, it would enrich the life of anybody on this mailing
list....:)

I have several other factory VW training tapes. I lend them out sometimes
although mostly I try to hide the fact that I have them because even though I
charge a fee for this it is debatable whether I should be spending the time
to do it.
