&gt; Hmmm... I thought the only camper option available in the US was the
&gt; &quot;weekender&quot;, which has a small wannabe-fridge under one of the seats.

	It's only been visible in the PNW (Pacific North...) for ~ a month,
	but, each VW dealer in the Portland area has (1) white Eurovan/Winne-
	bago camper on display. The dealer in Vancouver (USA) had it marked
	down to 27,770 due to considerable evidence of demo wear.

	The items I personally like are:

	-Better Van-more power-feels much lighter
	-Optional 12000 BTU furnace
	-Aux. (they call it a &quot;Coach&quot;) Battery
	-Bigger frig. than my '91 Camper
	-Lots of, both 12V &amp; 120V outlets
	-Screening all around the poptop
	-Rear(External) hose for showering

	What sucks:

	-Too tight between front seats
	-The shifter gets in the way when trying to move from front seat
	 to rear. My view is that if I have to get out of the vehicle
	 to do stuff in the rear, it's equivalent to a cap-on-a-pickup.
	-Cheap Blinds-prefer Vanagon curtains.


	Anyone wanting a fax of a picture, I cop't the owners manual. Send
	me your fax #.
