I wanted to add one thing here.  If the broken off bolt is short enough
that you drill all the way through it (you should be able to feel the
resistance change while you are drilling) stop and squirt some of that
rust penetrant (Another plug for the MOPAR rust penetrant, available
only at your Dodge dealer, but worth the trip and the $6/can price)
through the hole so it can attack the threads from the *inside*.  Just
one more little thing to do that might make the difference between
getting the broken piece out or not.  Great summary Dan!
