Subject: Re: Door light

&gt; That is correct.  This switch is only connected on 7 Passenger and
&gt; Weekender/Multivan Models
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Am I correct that in the Westfalia, even though there is a switch on 
&gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt;sliding door, there is no connected light that comes on when you open 
&gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt;door?
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
Odd that they added the switch.  Perhaps that is legacy of the addition (in
1981) of a Camper model.  My 1980 Westy does not have the switch -- it has
a plastic blanking plate.

Speaking of plastic blanking plates, has anybody ever added the above-door
light to a passenger side?  The appropriate hole appears to be there, but it
is covered by a plastic plate as well (despite it being covered by the
headliner).  I was thinking of adding another light there.
