Subject: Re: 72 Bus steering question

You can tighten the steering box to take out any play, but first check all 
the steering joints to see if they are worn. On the side of the steering box 
is a screw with a locknut. Loosen the locknut and remove the drag link from 
the steering box. Wiggle the drop arm with one hand while turning the screw 
with the other until there is no play, then tighten the locknut.
