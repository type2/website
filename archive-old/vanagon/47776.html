What make/model is your gas heater? Does your gas heater have its own fuel
pump? The Eberspacher gas heaters (yours is probably a BN4) should connect
directly to the top the gas tank, via a tap with 2 hoses. The gas is pumped
from the gas tank to a jet, which allows only a fraction of the pumped gas
to enter the combustion chamber. The excess gas is re-routed back to the
fuel tank  - sort of like a miniature fuel injection system.

If your model has a fuel pump but the pump doesn't work, e-mail me, as I
have successfully r&amp;r'd a few pumps.
