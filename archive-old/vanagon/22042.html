Subject: sway bar or stabilizer?
Date: Thu,  3 Aug 1995 13:49:37 GMT

Well, our 17-year-old son broke the sway bar on the blue and white '71
bus. He said that it just *popped* when he turned left.  Yeah, right!

Bob spent an hour or so removing the two broken pieces. The bar broke
on the left side near the bushing. The local ecology wrecking yard
wants $14 for a replacement, but you have to pull the part yourself.

Has any other bus owner out there ever had a sway bar break? Any tips
on installation?
