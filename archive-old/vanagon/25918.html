Subject: Transporterfest, was want T-shirt

Ric &amp; Christian both indicated a desire to have the &quot;offishul&quot;
vanagon list t-shirt after seeing mine at the Transporterfest.

Jeesh, if you had told me you wanted it when you saw it on Saturday,
either of could have easily gone home with it.

Course, Christian would have had to trade his nice 21-window split or
Ric would have had to give up his beloved EV. 

Then again, since I didn't have another shirt with me, I probably 
would have turned down both offers. I think Mass has a DWAS law,
Driving Without A Shirt :-).

Comfortable, (and Mass. law abinding), in my vanagon list shirt,

Drew
