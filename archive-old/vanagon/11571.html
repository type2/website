Subject: Re: Vanagon rear brake

I pulled my brake drums off over the weekend and realized that the rear
brakes are due for renewal. Any suggestion of which brand of brake shoes to
get or should I get dealer brake shoes only? I had problems for after
market brake pads for the front brakes but not sure about the rear.
Any experience/suggestions? Thanks.
