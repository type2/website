Subject: Re: missing shirts

Not to be a party pooper or anything, but the post office has some 
very unfriendly procedures regarding lost mail. My wife went through this 
with some pictures and stuff she sent her sister. Not only did they ask 
her to fill out a totally useless form, but they communicated with her in 
such a way that they seemed to be trying to place the blame on her.

I'd suggest factoring in a contingency for losses (say, 5%). If you don't 
loose too many shirts from this next shipment, send one of the extras to Ron.

Just a thought (from a guy who forgot to send his $$ last time and didn't 
get a shirt either).
