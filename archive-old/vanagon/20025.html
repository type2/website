Subject:  '72 Westphalia probs 

I am now the proud owner of a '72 Westphalia that almost runs right.  It
sat for a couple of years unused, and finally the owner (second owner, 
had it since '75) disposed of it.  Couple of minor problems with it:

-the bushings (in both carbs) that hold the rod that moves the throttle
plate seem to be shot -- the throttle plates move back and forth as well
as rotating.  Are bushings available separately, and if so, from where?  
My local VW dealers are no help. A couple of people have suggested that 
there are companies in California that re-bush carbs -- anybody closer 
to Ottawa, Ont. in Canada?

-there is a spark plug seized in one cylinder head that has apparently
been seized for some years (past tune-up receipts show *three* 
sparkplugs supplied).  Is there any easy solution, or am I stuck 
drilling the darn thing out and heli-coiling it?  It runs reasonably 
well, but...

-the rocker panel on the *driver's* side is rusted. Can I go the
fiberglass and bondo route, or is a metal rocker panel needed for body
stability? The rest of the body is solid (it was hit mildly a couple of
times, repaired well, and has been painted at least twice since new).

-I have acquired an air conditioner for the beast. It's apparently a VW
unit, and is supposed to be roof mounted (I haven't seen it; my mechanic
picked it up for me cheap).  Does anyone out there possibly have an
installation or user manual for it?  I'll gladly pay for a photocopy,
even.  I'm also going to need a dessicant canister for it -- any
suggestions on sources?
