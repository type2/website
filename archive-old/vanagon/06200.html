Subject: Stoned VW GIF

I recently gained access to a scanner (B&amp;W, alas).  To test it I scanned 
in one of my favorite vacation pics, taken in Amsterdam (.nl) in 1992. I 
have uploaded the result for your viewing pleasure.....

To get this picture FTP to ftp_dot_netcom_dot_com, cd to pub/dworkin/vw, &quot;ls&quot; to 
see the directory, change to &quot;binary&quot; mode and &quot;get&quot; stonedvw.gif. 
(BTW, anyone interested in economic stats can get them from the rest of 
/pub/dworkin.)
