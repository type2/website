Subject:       Re: Big Mutha Wire and Bus Cake

Unca' Joel responds:
&gt; david asked what 'gauge' the wire was, that i ran from the battery to the
&gt; starter mounting bolts. i used one that was as big as my little fingers
&gt; .. i have no idea what 'gauge' it was. 2? 3?  i got it because i also found
&gt; the connectors for it ... they had to be propane-torch soldered on. :(
&gt; 
&gt; now, in retrospect, i think a good 8 gauge would work just as well ... if it
&gt; is good enough for an ammeter, it ought to work fine for this. and it would
&gt; be a helluva lot easier to work with. but i would still solder the connectors
&gt; onto the wire. maybe a 6 gauge if you really want to get fancy.

With all due respect (that would be very little :)) and also 
ever-mindful of my soiled reputation (how those burns healing, Gerry?) 
I think one reason that adding the Big Mutha ground wire increased 
cranking speed is that is lowered the voltage drop on the negative 
side of the battery circuit.  That cable the size of your finger by 
passed the wiener grounds from the battery-to-battery box, 
frame-to-transmission, and trans-to-starter.  Adding a light 8 ga. 
wire will help the charging circuit keep things up to snuff by 
reducing ground-side resistance but is too small to have a 
significant effect when pulling 150 amps from the starter.

An additional note:  the Big Mutha positive cable I added to mine 
also helped.  Left the original in place too.  The routing was quite 
easy as I exited the battery box thru the vent holes (ran right 
inside the flexible hose) and then pushed it thru the big round hole 
onto the gas tank.  I think the ga. I added was 00 or 000 welding 
cable with crimped and soldered ends (oh yes, and color coded heat 
shrink over the terminal!)

YMMV.

ps-- Joel proves that when owning a VW van, one can have their cake 
and eat it too!
