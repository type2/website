Subject: Eng.swaps-'86 Jetta eng. FS...

Hi folks,  I saw an ad for a '86 Jetta engine for sale.
the car was wrecked, and I think they wanted like 200, or 300 for the engine, or
like 500 for the whole car.

might be good for someone swapping diesel to gas or whatever.....

e-mail me for specifics

chris
