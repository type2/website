Subject: Has anyone driven or owned a Rialta?  Test Drive!

Today I had the opurtunity to drive a Rialta.  This is a mini motor home type
vehicle that is bilt by Winnebago on top of a Eurovan chasis.  At 20 feet
long, I was quite impressed with the way it drove and handled.  With a GVWR
of 7,000lbs, I was surprised at how well it accelerated.  It actualy felt
faster than my synchro.  Must be the gearing!  The interior was very well
appointed including dual engine AC and heat.  It was also equiped with a
generator, roof AC, and a propane furnace.  It also had a two burner stove
and a microwave.  The refrigerator had a small freezer section.  It basicaly
had everything the Westfalia is missing.  It even had a bathroom with a pull
out shower.  It could seat 8, sleep 4 adults in comfort.  It even had acolor
TV with VCR connections.

My major concern was the rear axle design.  The axle actually is lower than
the rims.  I wonder if there is a problem hitting things on the road.  I am
also concerned about the reliability of the transmission.  It seems to be
worked very hard.  Anyway, I plan on waiting a few years and see if I can get
one of these used.  The list price was $47,000.  They came down to $42,000
and told me I could finance it for 15 years as it is a real motor home.  The
interest is also tax deductible as a second home.  Anyway, stil to rich for
my blood.  Maybe in five years I can one that is slightly broken in!  Yea,
right.

Infatuated for shure,
Dennis
