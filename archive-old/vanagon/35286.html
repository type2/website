Subject: Re: 23-Window Value?

Took a little better look at the 23-Window today.  Kinda bad from the 
bottom of the doors down.  The battery tray area is really bad, the belly 
pan is ratty, and the bottom of the cargo doors and rocker area looks like 
Hoover's foam trick (using Bondo).  The cab floor has been Bondo'd at the 
edges and the bottom of the front door posts.  What's good?  All original 
glass is intact except for two side windows (cracked) and the windshields 
look to be replacements (no markings).  The horn button, clock, radio, 
coat hooks, grab handles, ash tray, and church key are there.  No middle 
seat.  The rear seat and panels are covered in non-VW cloth.  Found some 
of the jail bars (the sides), though the other pieces may still be 
buried.  No external Deluxe trim (except front bumper).  No rear bumper.  
Nose and engine lid are straight (and not too rusty).  Front doors OK.  
Sunroof all there, but likes where it is (handle stuck).  Skylight rust 
not too severe.  All interior handles and pop-out latches are there (tho' 
some of the pins have been replaced with whatever).  Dunno, sounds like a 
parts Bus to me (tho' I'd rather sell it as a whole and soon).  More 
feedback please. :-)
