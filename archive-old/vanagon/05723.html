If you have the spare 50 dollars and are interested in obtaining a strong
bargaining chip; take the 79 to VW-wise mechanic and have him do all the
necessary tests (suspension, brakes, compression, FI, ignition etc). In
the event that you find somenthing wrong this info can be used to reduce the
price or alternatively get out of the deal. If everything checks out ok,
then you have peace of mind....DC

This problem is partially avoided in Canada, where every vehicle sold must
pass a safety test before it can be licensed; the onus falls either on the
seller's shoulders or the buyer's. DC
