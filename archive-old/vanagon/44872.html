Subject: Dumb question re: windshield washer reservoir

Well, up until now I've never had to add washer fluid to my buses.  So my question 
is...how do I get the air into the reservoir?  It doesn't seem to take a standard tire 
pump type of fitting.  Is there some special attachment I need?

It's a 77 and since I bought my first bus in October I've pretty much been using Mother 
Nature's windshield washer fluid which is provided non-stop and free of charge here in 
Vancouver.
