&gt; &gt; you can get these poundy things- its a piece of d*mn sturdy flat metal =
&gt; &gt; about
&gt; &gt; 1/2 thick that had a place for the big nut, and a place to hit it
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; danno
&gt;
&gt; I have one of these, and use it every now and then.  I have two concerns
&gt; with it, though:
&gt;
&gt; 1) I don't like delivering that kind of severe percussive shock to my
&gt; wheel bearings.  &lt;snip&gt;

Yeah, me neither, but w/o the BB Air Wrench what is there to be done?
If the 2-piece drum wasn't a joke we could all go to that system and only
remove the hub when the bearings were to be done anyway, but I have never
gotten the drums off one of those hub while the hub was on the car.

&gt;
&gt; 2) I don't hit the wheel with the hammer, but the &quot;wrench&quot; does touch the
&gt; wheel and it leaves impressions/scrapes along the surface where it was
&gt; touching the wheel when struck.  &lt;snip&gt;

You may not hit the wheel, but I usually bung up the road wheel pretty
good each time I use one of those wrenches.  I have been thinking of (but
have not) welding a 1&quot; thick piece of stock to the outer face of the
wrench to move the striking face further from the road wheel, and maybe
some sort of thin plate to the other side to protect the wheel from
&quot;misses&quot;.  Thick as those wrenches are, it isn't thick enough.
