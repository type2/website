Subject: Re: VW/T+A Magazines

Actually, the same sort of tactics used by these magazines is used in all
sorts of television advertising, only in a less blatant manner. Other
magazines have also moved to a more &quot;sophisticated&quot; approach to using sex
to sell. 

I'm working with one of my profesors on a book about the social
implications of television and this is one of the areas that concerns me
most. Few events can be directly tied to the core problems of our society,
but increasingly it's becoming more possible to tie commercial advertising
and mass media influences to changes in social values and norms. 

I see this sex-oriented advertising as one of the BIG LIES in society. The
implication is that youth, vigor, beauty and accessibility are attributes
we should esteem in partnering. In truth, these are superficial attributes
that neither enhance or detract from relationships. 

I don't want to go off on a totally non-VW tangent, but I think it's
important to realize that this sort of advertising is irresponsible
because of the impact it has on individuals. 

Disclaimer: I don't see anything inherently wrong with looking at attractive 
(or unattractive) people scant clothing; using these images for selling, 
however, is exploitive of the consciousness of consumers and an insulting 
disregard for our well-being.

Thanks! Joe

P.S. Please be kind enough to set flame throwers to stun, not fry!
