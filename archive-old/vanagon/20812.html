OK, OK! I thought I could sit this one out, but since it has
become an official list item now, here's the name[s] of my
'77 Camper. I call him, 'cause he's a he,  'Old Faithful',
since he never let me down. Friends in Seattle, where OF 
hails from, call him the 'Northwestern Spotted Owl' for all 
the black spots of the rust converter (OF has been patiently 
waiting for a paint job during the last year). My friends here 
call it 'the Buzz'.
