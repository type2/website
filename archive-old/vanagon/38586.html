hey now,

i bought some Bosch windshield wipers for Rumba's face..hmm, now i'm not stupid
but i was looking at the directions....is it that hard to put on windshield
wipers on a vw van? hmm, wow..any suggestions? i looked at it for about 30
minutes and then gave up. how the hell do you put them on?
