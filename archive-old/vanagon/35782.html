Subject: How a thermostat can fail closed.

Hello all,
	I have just recently had the heads rebuilt on my '81 Westy.  I had the 
heads rebuilt by Mark Stephen's High Performance,  but  I've been doing 
the rest of the work myself.  I am a novice, this is the first time I 
have owned a VW and the first time I have tried to do this kind of work 
on any vehicle.
	 I followed all of the directions to reassemble my engine, including
reinstalling the flaps and thermostat.  What I didn't realize was that the
thermostat was already sprung, it was already at its maximum size.  After my
first long, 40 mile, test drive, I found the engine was running hot and the
flaps were not open.  I figured that something was wrong with the thermostat,
so I looked in &quot;Bentley&quot;  to see what it has to say about the thermostat. 
All Bentley says is, &quot;-put thermostat in water, 85-90 degrees C, 'a'min
46mm,&quot; where 'a' is the length of the thermostat.  This is important
information, but incomplete to a beginner like me.  My old thermostat passes
this test but it does not get any smaller when cold.  My new thermostat is
32mm long when cold and expands dramatically in boiling water.
	This incident demonstrates how a novice can screw things up if he 
does not understand what he is doing and how the parts are supposed to 
work. The Bentley guide is not written the beginner in mind, it 
sometimes gives just enough information to make a novice like me dangerous.


	Thank You and Good Luck.
