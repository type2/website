Subject: Re: Rebuild time

I had my 78 bus engine rebuilt by Fast German Auto and they did an excellent
job.  I have also visted AVP near Sacrmento, CA and was very impressed with
their knowledge of vanagon rebuilding(The shop was super clean also). Hope
that helps.  Usual disclaimers apply.

Best,

Bill Lund
