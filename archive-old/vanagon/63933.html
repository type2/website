Subject: '89 Syncro For Sale Vanagon Weekender for sale

&gt;
&gt;&gt;       I have a 1989 Vanago Syncro Weekender (non-westie) for sale.  Have
spent thousands keeping it running since It is one of the most functional,
comfortable and fun vehicles I have ever owned.  However, I need to move on.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;It has 186000 miles on it but the engine compression is excellent with no
leaks that haven't been fixed.  New clutch at 105000 miles, new cables here
and there, new exhaust, new water pump and a hundred other items that add
up.  Also, just put a rebuilt front drive line in it.  Brakes are new of
course.  Tires good.  It was (is) the fancy version with air conditioning
(works well) power windows (converted driver side to manual) power mirrors
(don't work) etc.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;It does have some rust on it and could use a paint touch up.  There is
also a slight rumble noise when driving that I and my mechanics haven't been
able to pinpoint.
&gt;
Asking $5400.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;If interested email me at rgilmour_at_ditell_dot_com or call me at (801)
649-1161.  The van is in Park City, Utah  (Salt LAke City).  I may be taking
a drive trip to Vermont in October, and would be willing to deliver it back
east if someone were interested.
