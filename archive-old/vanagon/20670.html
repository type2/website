Subject: Thing F.S.

Yeh, I know this is a Vanagon list.  But I figured some of you (are you 
listening martha?) might want/be interested in this.  A use car dealer 
just down my street has a yellow thing (I spied it going home last night -
It was sort of hidden) for sale.  I checked it out briefly. Here's the 
details:  Yellow, no really noticable rust (I didn't crawl under it). 
Dual port 1600 w/ progessive carb. (Look very good - didn't hear it run or
check comp.) Broken windshield.  No top (of course). Spare starter on drivers
side floor.  Dealer told me it ran great(of course).  How much ?, I ask.
Dealer SAYS $500!  I told my wife, she just laughed.  So I'll probably 
NOT pick this thing up (Although....)  Anyone else interested, let me know.
