bill &amp; diane killian inquired:

&gt;Is the piston slp 
&gt;problem a drive train thing that would give me extra time or is it only 
&gt;under the 24/24 bumper to bumper?  What do I do to convince the dealer 
&gt;to reasses the engine?

In speaking w/ the service mgr. of the local dealer, he indicated that 
the 5yr/50k mile drivetrain warranty covers potential problems like the
piston slap syndrome we're discussing here.

There are supposedly 10 &quot;reporting&quot; dealerships that get back to VW (and
vice versa) regarding reported problems from the field (folks like us)
and are suppose to be up to date w/ recall notices and tech. bulletins.
Perhaps calling up a few dealerships near large metro areas may uncover
some useful info for you.

Of course, you could rev the engine way past redline and blow it...that 
would convince the dealer to reasses the engine  ;-)   ('sorry bill, I
couldn't resist)
