Subject: more Q's on the TDI


Thanks to all of your for your response on the TDI (turbo direct
injection diesel) engine for the transporter.  This engine is
available in the passat in California, and soon to appear in
the golf and jetta models.  VW is not yet sure if the van version
will come to this country, but I'm keeping my finger crossed,
because of the 35 mpg fuel economy.

Meanwhile, the passat gets 45 mpg, and the golf and jetta will
get 50.  :)  This brings up some questions I have, since I've
never owned a diesel, and thought some of you might know:

1.  If I run out of diesel, what happens if I get stuck and put
    regular gas into the car?  Explosion?

2.  And just for theoretical fun, what about the reverse - if my
    regular gas cars runs out, and I put in diesel, what will happen?

3.  Theoretically speaking, if I can't find a diesel station, and am
    about to run out of fuel, what happens if I use home heating oil
    in the car (apart from it being illegal).  Is it EXACTLY the
    same substance?  If not, how does it differ?  I think that in
    certain countries the home oil is the same but has dye in it.
    If that's the case in the U.S., what would this dye do to
    the car if one had to use it once in an emergency situation?

Other things you want to tell me about diesels?  :)

TIA,
