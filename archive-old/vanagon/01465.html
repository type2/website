Subject: expensive heater boxes

914 heat exchangers, stainless or not, will not fit Type 4 van.  914 engine
is in the middle of the car, wrong way round (taking the van to be &quot;the way
God meant engines to face&quot;.)  

The only option I can think of would be heater boxes from the 411,412 if you
can still find them, but I think they were less expensive because they didn't
exchange as much heat.  All 411,412 brought to this continent came with gas
heater, I believe, so heater boxes were smaller.

Which brings up another option: strip the rusty swiss cheese off your heater
boxes, run them as &quot;headers&quot; and install a gas heater.

Before doing that, look in JCWhitney catalog for prices.  I think the Type
4 heater boxes are still in there.  Myself, I would get the right parts, al-
beit expensive, and have them powdercoated before installing them, figuring
to get as many years out of them as possible.

Good luck
B.
