Subject: How many O-rings on Thermostat

Could someone tell me where and how many o-rings go on the thermostat and
housing.  My old one had a ring that fit around the lip of the lower part of
the housing and got compressed between the halves of the housing.  A
different housing (stripped holes on orig) has only an o-ring around the
thermostat itself which then fits snugly inside the housing.  I reassembling
my motor and the gasket kit seems to have both rings.  I would be
appreciative if someone could steer me straight on this. Thanks.
