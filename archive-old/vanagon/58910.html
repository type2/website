&gt;There were rumors  that the first syncros were breadloafs, and I once

&gt;4x4 breadloaf crawling up a snowbank. Several prototypes were built,
&gt;including
&gt;two Westies.

Hi Michael,

that's perfectly allright. According to Randolf Unruh's &quot;VW Transporter  &amp; 
Bus&quot; monographie and several articles in the germen Off-Road magazine T2 
Allrad activities started in the mid 70s initiated by Henning Duckstein and 
Gustav &quot;Transporter&quot; Mayer. As VW Top-Management was not very pleased with 
these ideas (Remember: This were the years after the first OPEC oil-embargo). 
Development had to take place besides the normal design and testing 
activities. Eight of these &quot;4x4 cigars&quot; were built in total. Although off-road 
performance and press reactions were very positive, VW didn't take the 4x4 
into regular production until they made up their minds to launchthe syncro in 
1985.

Same situation like nowadays: A lot of people want a &quot;real&quot; successor for the 
T3 syncro especially the 16''(which the T4 [EuroVan] will never really  be) 
but Volkswagen refuse to build and sell it !

Technicals of the prototypes:

2,0l 70 HP aircooled gasoline engine
selctable 4x4
half-automatic transmission, no reduction gear 

If further info is desired give me notice, i'll go into my files and translate 
something for you. Unfortunately I don'have any coulour pics besides the one 
Tom Forhan has already put to the SW site. All the rest are b/w copies.
