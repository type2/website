Subject: Bus names

Well, since my '73 bus hasn't been on the road long enough (and is now back off
the road) I really haven't fully christened it.  First it was Karobka (&quot;Box&quot; in
russian) and it might stay that way.  I've actually been trying to think of a
new model designation since it's a bus with a camper interior, I've been
thinking of &quot;Campus&quot; or &quot;Bumper&quot;.  Any better ideas?

-Erik.
