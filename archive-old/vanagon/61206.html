Subject: Vanagon transmissions

Fellow listees,

A few days ago I informed all you esteemed folks about my purchase of a
consignment of brand new OEM Vanagon transmissions as part of a package deal
involving some other stuff I had ordered from overseas. At that time I had
mentioned that I was in the process of inventorying everything, and would
have prices for you all shortly. Well, here they are:
The 094 series 5-speeds are $2200 ea. (available with either the 5cyl. or
inline 4cyl. bell-housings).- installation into a waterboxer Vanagon involves
a simple switchover of bell-housings. I have one installed in my 90-1/2
Westfalia, and it works great!
The 090 series automatics are $1995 ea. They are complete with torque
converters.
I only had ten of the 091/1 series 4-speeds and unfortunately, they're all
gone at $1995 ea. however, judging from the response I had, I'm going to look
into finding some more.
Now, I'm not making a killing on these. I am making a very nominal 10% on
this stuff.
Just to give you folks a price comparison, a &quot;rebuilt&quot; 4-speed at the VW
dealer is upwards of $2200. And that is with a rebuildable core in exchange.
These, on the other hand, are brand new, no exchange required. Shipping is
additional. I am also looking into getting some Syncro drivetrain stuff, as,
judging from the threads I've been reading, there's a lot of tired Syncros
out there needing stuff. I'll keep you all posted. If any of you folks are
interested in these trannies, either e-mail me, or call (714)771-3763
(work)9-5PST, or (714)283-2966.

Sincerely,


Vic Ahmed
