So Marcus with-the-extra-long-sig Pearson says:
&gt; Hi there,
&gt; 
&gt; We have a 1991 Vanagon Westfalia and I've noticed that I have
&gt; to replenish the engine coolant (yes I am using the proper kind)
&gt; more often than on any other vehicle we have owned (maybe every 3
&gt; fill-ups).
&gt; Is this a warning flag of any kind or is it just a characteristic
&gt; of the van?

Yep.  Better check for leaks.  Do you smell coolant inside the
van?  If so, check under the bench and look for coolant on the
bottom.  Remove the cover off of the auxilary heater.  If it's
been leaking, there will be plenty of coolant around to show 
that it has.  

If it's not from the auxilary heater, then you might want to
look on the ground where you park your van after a drive and
see if any puddles are forming.  If not, start with the expansion
tank in the rear and work forward checking all hose and pipe
junctions.  Yes, you'll have to lay on the ground and look under
neath too if you don't find any leaks in the engine compartment.
Check all the way forward till you get to the radiator.  The
most common spots are the expansion tank and the auxilary heater.
I'd really doubt the radiator unless you've had excessive air in 
the system.  Check around the engine heads and the coolant pump
and thermostat.  Do not let this go.  The leak can cause expensive
engine damage.
