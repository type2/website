 ea are $50 for a limited time/selected applications....&quot;  Phone is listed as

If anyone is interested in any bilstein,boge or other suspension part contact
ASI in San Diego...ask for Mark Anderson, the owner, and tell him Ed Berroth
from British Motors in Ramona, recommended you to him and give you the same
brake on price I received...

Mark has been the de-facto Bilstein wholesaler for 16 years and i have known
him in this capacity since.If i can remember... the phone # is 619-584-2890
