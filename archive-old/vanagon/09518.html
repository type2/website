So David Schwarze says: 
&gt; The only problem with Joshua Tree is that it is fairly far from the Bay &gt; area, where most of the West-coast vanagon owners seem to be.  Another
&gt; nice place is Red Rock Canyon, which is farther North on highway 395.
&gt; It features a large campground and beautiful sandstone formations like
&gt; those in Bryce canyon (Utah).  It's kind of isolated though.  Either of
&gt; these places would be fine with me for the next pre-tour.  How does
&gt; late March sound?

Well, I'm interested.  Can you estimate the number of hours to travel
from Sac. as well as the number of hours from a point in the bay
area so I know how much travel time I need to account for?

The reason I'm asking is because I don't think I can afford any
more vacation days if I want to do the N. American tour later
in May.  Sooo... I don't want too long of a drive just for a
weekend.  

Thanks

Steven
