I checked out the Vanagon site VW of South Africa.  Boy they have some
great new Vanagons for sale!  Wish only if we can get our hands on those
new suckers.
Twin round headlights, 5 cylinder engines2.6l., new steering wheel
design!
Wonder if the inline5 sticks up higher compared to the flat?

Later Jack
