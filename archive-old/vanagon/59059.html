&lt;&lt;  Howdy all. This is for everyone who owns a bus, and has at some time
wished
 for the extra sleeping space of the luxurious double bed pop-top, available
on
 Westfalias starting in 1974. I myself have long craved such a top, but never
 desired the mechanical complexities of those later campers. So, the only
course
 for me, and everyone else out there with no pop-top is surgery. Having done
the
 operation last weekend, I am pleased to announce that the necessary
transplant
 is not painful, and the results are definately worth it. &gt;&gt;


To whom it may concern, I have the whole poptop/roof section/bed etc out of a
'75 westy available, if anyone's interested in undertaking this conversion...
