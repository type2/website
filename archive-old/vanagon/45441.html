&gt; Anyone care to comment on this topic when it comes to waterboxers? My 
&gt; '88 shows 2500-4500 rpm as the 'green' zone on the tach, and 5250 (I 
&gt; think) as the redline. During our last trip, I drove 3rd gear at 
&gt; about 4200-4400 rpm for up to 20 minutes at a time with no problems.

Hello all,
    I have had my '86 Vanagon for 5 years.  I drove it down the Alcan
highway, at speeds of 60 to 70 mph, 3800 to 4000 rpm, every day.  It was an
11 day trip.  I still drive 50 miles each day at speeds of 65 to 75 mph,
3900 to 4400 rpm.  The van has over 162,000 miles on it.  I think that a max
rpm of below 4000 is a little to conservitive. IMHO :-)
       It is true that the more you use an engine the faster it will wear.
I think that 160,000 is doing well for a slightly abused 2.1.  If I had
stayed under 4000 rpm the engine might go 250,000 before a rebuild, I just
can't drive that slow.

If you can't dazzle them with brilliance,
baffle them with bull sh*t.
