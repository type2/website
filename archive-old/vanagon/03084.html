Subject: whatshisname is back.

I'm back.  I got my exhaust pipe welded in Utah, and I've got what I think
is a squeaky water pump, but I put on 3,441 miles and averaged about 24.6
miles per gallon and didn't have any other problems (except for possible
vapor lock at one point), so I'm pretty happy. I'll post more as I become
coherent.  I'm rather road worn.
