&gt;Please, what is a wasserboxer??

It's all very simple. The later model vanagons, from about '82 to '91, are
closer in design to Ben Pon's original idea than any other VW van. His
original idea, of course, was an aquarium on wheels (in German,
&quot;wasserboxer&quot;). Unfortunately the dream has never been fully realized (the
vanagon does not come from the factory with water or fish, and you have to
do a little modification to make it hold them), but with its boxy look and
many windows, the vanagon comes close. ;-)

Now if only I knew what &quot;todd&quot; meant. (could Todd Bridges, famous for his
stint on Diff'rent Strokes have something to do with it?...)
