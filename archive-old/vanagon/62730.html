Call his bluff and force the issue.  Don't stop until you are satisfied
that everything is proper.  You think of the service manager as a friend,
but he obviously thinks of you as a sucker, just another g**d*** customer
taking up his valuable time with your silly complaints.  (Whew!!  I feel
better, now.)

&gt; 
&gt; This is one of those questions that I could as easily put to my
therapist,
&gt; if I had one, the car guys, if I could ever get an open line, or you
lucky
&gt; stalwarts of the Vanagon list!
&gt; 
&gt; here goes, it's auto-psycho-sociological: opinons please!?
&gt; 
&gt;        I have a reasonably good relationship with the dealership service
&gt; department where I purchased my Vanagon new, six years ago.  I know,
that's
&gt; mostly because I mostly, quietly allow them to fleece me about once every
&gt; six months.
&gt; 
&gt;         Lately, every time I have some little thing done, they leave some
&gt; part of the job undone!  This last trip was worse! I had the front brakes
&gt; done and drove the 100+ miles home only to discover that my chrome lugs
had
&gt; been switched for black ones! chrome on the back, dingy black on the
front.
&gt; There were no other Vanagons in the shop that day so I thinking the swap
&gt; was intentional, and I'm really steamed.  Never the less I call the
service
&gt; manager whom I think of as a friend, and suggest that a mistake has been
&gt; made.  He gets a little huffy and sez it could not happen, no other vans
in
&gt; the shop that day and Vanagon lugs are unique to Vanagons, must have been
&gt; that way when I brought it in. I know that's not the case.  I washed the
&gt; van two days before: chrome all around.  Now I'm not only angry I'm
&gt; worried!  What if these are not the correct lugs and they were just
forced
&gt; in?  I might be in danger of them breaking or coming out because they are
&gt; stripped.  Will I have to buy new hubs?  in the face of the service
&gt; manager's denial do I force the issue over eight lug bolts or just order
&gt; new ones for one of the suppliers on the list and then find a new
&gt; mechanic??
&gt; 
&gt; thanks for any advise any of you can offer.
