Gas heaters are quite a pain in the butt to install.  I just had one transferred 
from my old 78 to my new 77.  The guy that did it was so happy when I drove it 
away because he doesn't want to look at it anymore.  Apparently it's even harder 
to put one into a van that didn't already have one.

They work great so if you know someone who can do it then go for it but you might 
lose an arm and leg.  The guys that did it for me only agreed to do it because I 
was giving them an engine, tranny, FI, etc as part of the deal.  Otherwise they 
just would have laughed at me.
