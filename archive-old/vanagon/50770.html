Subject: Re: Replacing water hoses

&gt; &lt;&lt; 
&gt;  Also, someone mentioned a blown head gasket would cause water hoses to 
&gt;  break due to increased pressure. Why? I've notice no decrease in performance
&gt; 
&gt;  or watery exhaust, though I have the common Vanagon water leak from the
&gt;  cyclinder heads that I've temporarily stopped up with AlumaSeal.
&gt;  
&gt;  All responses appreciated. Thanks!
&gt;   &gt;&gt;
&gt; It seems that somthing is over pressurizing the system to cause repeated hose
&gt; failures.  A swollen expansion tank is another cause of concern.  Something
&gt; is wrong.  Also check cooling fan operation and have a leakdown test
&gt; performed on the engine.  It is possible to have combustion gases enter the
&gt; cooling system without a noticeable los of coolant or performance.

You should check the pressure cap on the coolant reservoir.  The Bentley
should give the spec for it, but these typically should release at 12lbs
pressure or so outbound, and should be fairly easy to blow into (the little
pipe on it).  It should make a pretty fair duck call, blowing into the
little pipe inlet!  You should have the problem of all your water going
out the overflow rather than bursting hoses -- they should be able to contain
the 12lbs.
