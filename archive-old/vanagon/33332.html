&gt;
&gt;Once, someone asked me to jump their car.  I very carefully connected
&gt;from the red battery lead of one car to the red battery lead of the
&gt;other, and black to black.  A few short seconds later, my wife asked,
&gt;&quot;Why are the jumper cables smoking?&quot;  I immediately grabbed one of the
&gt;clamps and yanked it off the battery terminal.

        One of Robert Fuhlghm's books had an excellent account of this
activity. Difference is, Fuhlghm and the other guy didn't catch it 'til
they *welded* the cables to thier batterys and fried the other guys
electronic ignition. VW content-Fuhlghm was driving a type 2, don't know
the year.  BTW, Fuhlghm's books are excellent reading material, if you
haven't already read them.

Peace,
