Congratulations.  Did you know that my boyfriend, Dan Greening, founded the
moderator AIDS mailing list?  If you don't know about it, you should write
Dan at 'greening_at_chaco_dot_com'.

&gt;But hey, I gave me time off for the Inuvik trip!  (I insisted on it!  
&gt;Wouldn't accept the offer until they gave me the time, heh, heh.)
&gt;
&gt;ObVW: I can actually afford to do some overdue repairs and have $$$ for 
&gt;the Inuvik trip!  Hmmm... maybe I'll take a second look at taking the 
&gt;ferry for part of it...

Cool!  I hope so!  (Now I gotta work on the itinerary for that segment...)
