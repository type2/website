Subject: [FFFFF] Tanks for nuthin'!

Joel sed:

&gt;well, i certainly hope Ralphie Boy Nader doesn't find out about how poorly
&gt;a vanagon (and a winnebago) came out in the California 60-ton Crash Test!

You know, I was just thinking, what would happen if a covoy of 30 Type 2s
in a convoy _at_ 30mph happened to nail this particular tank head on, while
it was traveling merrily along _at_ 30mph?

Would we have 30 sequential spontaneous bus/van/transporter explosions,
or one hell of a pileup on the interstate (and a bunch of German troops
running around with bad headaches)?

Inquiring (idle) minds want to know!....
