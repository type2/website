The automobile industry refers to permanent antifreeze as the all season type
that rplaces alcohol.  I have an antique car,(1923 HAYNES) whose owners
manual recomends filling the cooling system with Karosene for winter
operation.  They also warn you not to boil the system!!!  Fire hazard or
something to that effect.

My dad talked about using diesel fuel in the rads of early trucks.
Another thing they used to do, was drain the oil at night when they
got home, and bring it into the house. 
In the morning, you put the oil pot on the woodstove, and when it started to
smoke, you went out, poured the oil into the engine, and started it, then 
went in and finished breakfast. The alternative was building a fire 
under the oil pan!
And I bitch when I have to go out to plug in the large lamp
I use for a block heater.Jeez
