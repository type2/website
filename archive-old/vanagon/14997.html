Subject: Sad tale of Woe !
From: alun jenkins &lt;alun_at_krypton.win-uk_dot_net&gt;

The saga continues:
My 1990 1700 D T2 went in on Monday as the thing was putting up a
smoke screen James Bond would have been proud of. Head came off
and disaster of disasters its cracked beyond repair. Each pot has a
crack between inlet and ex valves and a crack from there to the
swirl chamber and out to the edge of the head.

I now have several options:
1) get a new head, very hard to find and expensive 1000 for VW
or 500 for pattern. down side is the block could be busted.
2) get a recon motor, again 1000 and could again show same
problem quickly (most UK specialists tell me the 1.7 is a DOG)
3) Put in a 1.6 Turbo, 2000 brand new motor, Seems like a good bet
4) Put in a 1.9 TDi (audi80 unit) a local co can do this for 2000
again this is a brand new unit. Problems what to do with gearing
if i put this in given that it chucks out 50% more power than the
1700

All advice welcome, and I will report on the outcome here.

PS someone mentiond transporters Uk anyone have a phone no for
these guys ?
