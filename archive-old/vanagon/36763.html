&gt; but being a Virgo, i like to  pay attention to details.   I feel like it
&gt; could hurt the piston, being hit against the head studs.  (note excessive
&gt; amount of masculine terminolgy in engines- i'm feeling very macho now)

Mmmm. I'll have you know that I use pink fingernail polish to mark what 
cylinder &amp; head goes where. (We shall see who is endowed with _machismo_ 
when the Cruise Director realizes that her fingernail polish is in the 
garage with black thumbprints all over it. I suspect it will not be me.)
