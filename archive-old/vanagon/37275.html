Subject: online air-cooled junkyard?

Hi All,

A friend/partner of mine just dragged in a 70-ish Sundial--this brings the
number of air-cooled's in his backyard to about 45.  Nothing really
special, but lots of good parts.  It has occured to me that an on-line
junkyard might be a viable side-line business.  Fenders and such would be
out of the question because of shipping costs. However, small chrome
trinkets and the like could be shipped very reasonably.  My thought is to
set up a web page with photos of the yard and when a request for a part
comes in, to take a digital photo of the part in question and email it back
along with pricing info.  I would try to keep Greed under control and keep
prices cheap.  What do you all think?  Should I forget it? Should I buy a
digital camera tommorow?  Would you shop on-line?   What am I forgetting? 
Any and all comments would be greatly appreciated.          


Thanks,

Tom
