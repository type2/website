Subject: 2nd battery.._dot_deep cycle?


I've purchased a battery isolator, and I'm now wondering what type of 
battery to purchase as the 'accessory' battery.

I'm planning to run a cooltron cooler off the battery overnight (maybe a
fridge down the road) so I thought a deep cycle battery would be better suited
to this than a standard car battery.

Any thoughts on the matter?
