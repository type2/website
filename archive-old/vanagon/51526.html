Eric, if this is so, why did the coolant not fill up the overflow reservoir on the way 
home (from combustion gases again displacing even more coolant)? I would expect this to 
be an ongoing and relentless problem. It is now staying at a &quot;normal&quot; level? I would 
expect for the cooling main tank to suck all of the overflow reservoir dry when the 
engine cools down (since some is being displaced by combustion), but it's not?

Any thoughts on this?
