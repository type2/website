That's it?  Just plain ol' boring stats.  No song?  No poems?  What 
the hell is the matter with all of you people?  It could be that if you
are like me you tried hard to keep up with the volume on this list 
this week and find yourself on Friday afternoon trying to get some 
work done before the boss starts asking questions.

I will try:

Buses are my bag
Wish mine did not leak oil
&gt;From several holes.

Sung to the tune of Rocky Racoon.
