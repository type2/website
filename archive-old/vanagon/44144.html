&gt; If you don't mind a really boring drive, I noticed a yellow 60ish Karman
&gt; Ghia convertible on a used car lot. The paint looks new, but I haven't asked
&gt; about the price they want for it. Of course, this would means you'd have to
&gt; drive to Saskatoon. You should be able to find a few in Calgary. I did see
&gt; some in Lethbridge when I was there a few months ago - check out Letbridge
&gt; Auto Haus (the VW dealership) as they always have some aircooled VW's on
&gt; their lot.

Sorry to respond to the list but I missed the original post, and don't 
have his address...

But, isn't one of the &quot;spots&quot; of the Great Canadian Bug Show in Calgary?

It's usually on the closest sunday to July 21.
