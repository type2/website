Subject: RE: Michelin LTX M/S for the Vanagon


&gt;I've decided to trade in my Bridgestone Duelers P195/75R14 for
&gt;Michelin LTX M/S LT195/75R14. The passenger tire Duelers stink,
&gt;very squirrelly in the wind, to the point of being dangerous.
&gt;They only have 1500 miles on them, but I hate 'em, so I'm going
&gt;to take a lose on this. I can only hope that others can learn
&gt;from my mistake.

Can't really disagree with your decision to dump the passenger tires.
VW recommends LT, C, D, or reinforced tires, for good reason.

But before you yank them off, try this:

1.) Check the max inflation pressure of the Bridgestones, imprinted
on the sidewall of the tire.

2.) Inflate your rear tires to two pounds more than this (I know,
that's overinflation, but only a leetle bit)

3.) Inflate your front tires to ten pounds less than the max pressure,
which is 12 less than the rears. If that brings the fronts down below
25 psi, set the fronts at 25 psi instead.


Try that in difficult conditions (freeway, gusty winds, etc), and see
if it handles any better. The reason I suggest this, is because I did
it to the BFG passenger-car tires on the V6anagon, and it made a world
of difference. I now run them at 37 rear, 27 front. Max on these tires
is 35, and they are 215/75R14s.

If your handling is still bad, then you're no worse off-- time to remove
and replace with the correct tires.
