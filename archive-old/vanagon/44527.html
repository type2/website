Subject: (T4) Distributor Misalignment on Engine Installation

Problem discription:
After removing and reinstalling a T4 engine (75-82) (I think FI only), the
engine will not start or runs very rough.

Discussion:
Recently a couple of listmembers have had problems with the distributor
apparently &quot;skipping a tooth&quot; during engine removal/installation.  I have
had this happen to me or to vans I was helping other people with a number
of times.  I don't know what is happening, but it has gotten to the point
where a common thread has developed in my mind and one of the first checks
I run (along with dwell and vacuum) when a T4 engine won't start or runs
rough after an engine removal/installation is for distributor firing
position.

Solution?

If you know about a service bulletin or other VW notice, by all means let
the list know.  Otherwise, if this problem sounds familiar to you please
let me know. (off list)  I would like to here from anyone who has had this
problem and what was done to diagnose/cure it.

                           TIA,
                           H Steven Dolan
