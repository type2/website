Subject: Heads up for 78 champagne edition bus

Hey everyone,

Just wanted to put out an APB for a champagne edition bus sitting in a
junkyard somewhere in North America.  It must be out there, and I want
the interior!

This bus had unusual colors.  The exterior is 2-tone, brown bottom and
brick-red top, with disco stripes painted along the sides.  Interior
panels are red vinyl with chrome stripe accents.  The seats were
apparently either red vinyl with brown corduroy panels, or brown vinyl
with red corduroy panels, not sure which, as none of the original
seats came with my bus.  The dashboard, steering wheel, and related
plastic bits were a dark, chocolate brown color, NOT black.

I'm looking for a good interior (panels, seats, carpets???), and some
plastic bits.  If anyone can give me a line on any of this stuff, I'd
appreciate it.  In particular, I guess brown plastic bits wouldn't
necessarily have to come from a champagne edition.  I'm in central NJ,
so east coasters especially keep your eyes peeled...

Many thanks,
Rodney
