Subject:      Re: WTB or info needed: complete set of coolant hoses for 2.1

Karl &amp; The List, et al

I now have factory diagrams of all the Wasserboxer Hoses uploaded to my
website for people to determine which hoses are in need of replacement.
These diagrams are directly from the Dealer's Hosebook which are printed
copies of the fiche (I'm not sure if the book is available anymore so
I've guarded it with my life for the past 6 years since getting one).

I don't purport to carry these hoses - in fact most (if not all) are only
available through Volkswagen.  None of the major importing warehouses
have cared to add or stock them in their line, primarily because of poor
mark-up from Germany and not enough market to justify stocking them.
Perhaps Ron, Kyle and myself ought to get together on a group buy of
these items somewhere down the road.

Just go to the Website and follow the directions to the diagram that fits
your Wasserboxer.

&gt;Kyle, Ron, or others who have done it:
&gt;
&gt;I want to replace all rubber coolant hoses on my 86 Westy.  Can a
&gt;complete
&gt;set of rubber hoses be purchases all at once to do this, or do I have
&gt;to
&gt;pull each one and go up to a parts sales counter?
&gt;
&gt;I would rather have the complete set in hand and then start taking off
&gt;all
&gt;of the old rubber hoses.  This would include the radiator hoses (maybe
&gt;even
&gt;the twin van length ones), heater hoses (although it looks like bulk
&gt;standard heater hose would work), all the misc. short, large and small
&gt;rubber hoses up near the engine, and the transluscent tubes that run
&gt;up
&gt;around the lip of the engine compartment, too.  Every time I'm under
&gt;the
&gt;van, I notice a new coolant hose previously concealed from view.  Any
&gt;one
&gt;of these looks like it could lead to catestrophic coolant lose someday
&gt;if
&gt;gone unreplaced.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for the help.
