Here it is - the Newsletter is caled &quot;EuroVan Update&quot;, published
by HP Products - they're out of Kentucky, not Kansas - sorry, 
probably a typical New Englander mix up.  Here's the address:

EuroVan Update
6330 Waid Circle
Paducah, KY  42001

It's a quarterly newsletter, began in Dec '95.  Usually about a dozen
pages.  They've done a survey of EV owners seeking out any pattern
problems (like the flakey water temp gauge) and suggesting solutions
(cold solder joint on the circuit board, then published a how-to on
getting into the dash to resolder).  Had a blurb once about how it's
possible to order the actual dealer's shop manuals ($150 or so), and
gave the VW part # to do so - since Bentley still hasn't gotten off
their duff.  Haven't done this yet, but with 68k on my van, I can see
the day coming...

Hope this helps -
