   Howdy All!
   I really meant to get on the &quot;Intro Bandwagen&quot; last week, but commitments at
   work made it impossible. So, if you will bear with me.....

   I'm Tom Carrington!
   I work as a sysadmin/network tech at Bell Atlantic.

   I have been messing with VW's in a big way since high school (class of '85).
   In fact, in my senior year, me and a few of my friends pulled the best
   &quot;senior prank&quot; that school had seen in a long time. We managed to take 2
   (count them, two!) VW Beetles apart, and reassemble them on the *second*
   floor of the school library one night! School called the cops, but we got off
   with just a slap on the wrist. (If anyone would volunteer to have one of
   these pictures on a web page, I would be happy to scan them in JPEG or GIF
   format...)

   Before becoming addicted to computers, I was a complete gearhead. I started
   working on cars with my father when I was about 12, and got my first &quot;real&quot;
   job as a mechanic's apprentice at a local service station when I was 15.
   Immediately after high school, started working as a mechanic. Started working
   on boats instead of cars in 1986, and worked for a dealership until 1990.
   Then started my own boat repair business, which I kept until 1993.

   The business was not a complete success, so I got a night job working at IBM
   in Spring 1991 as a computer operator. Got really into it, and in Spring
   1993, got my first Novell sysadmin job. Just before joining Bell, I spent a
   year traveling the country teaching the Novell CNE and Microsoft CSE classes
   for a company called Wave Technologies. What a racket!!!

   So here I am.  I have immensely enjoyed this list. THANKS GERRY!! THANKS
   JOEL!!!
