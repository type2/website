&gt; I read somewhere that it may be advantageous to install spark plugs so
&gt; that their open end faces the intake valve.  This can be achieved with the
&gt; help of washers. This is to prevent the spark from occuring in the shadow 
&gt; created by the electrode. Comments?

Isn't that referred as &quot;degreeing the spark plug&quot;?  I have heard of this
being done in racing engines.
