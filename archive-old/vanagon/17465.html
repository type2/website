Subject: Question about driving into Canada with missing license plate
Date: Fri, 12 May 1995 14:59:08 -0700 (PDT)

Volks,
	I went out to the bus this morning, and the front license plate
is missing.  :(  It was beaten up pretty bad from offroading, and I think
it just fell off.  My question is:  Will I still be able to cross the
border into Canada without a front plate?  I still have the rear plate
which has the registration sticker.  Any help appreciated!
