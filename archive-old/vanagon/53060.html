Subject: mail list problems

Gerry has apparently gotten the rest of his beer of the month
subscription all at once (and then some!)  

Now I know it's Friday, but what's going on with the mail???  I'm having
to post 2 or 3 times and others have had similar problems.  There
appears to be some great delay in getting the messages distributed to
the list members.  Chris (after posting a wonderful message about
sunroofs-- 6 times!) discovered that there was a 24 hour delay in
getting those messages out!

Please check this out (before I need a subscription to the beer of the
month!)

P.S. Joel, you get this twice because you probably know the direct
e-mail to whoever needs to fix this!
