Subject: Re: Aux Heater??

&gt;I am a new member to this list and a new vanagon owner (84 westy), so 
&gt;please excuse what may be a stupid question...I have a green knob on 
&gt;the dash to the right of the steering column.  From what I can tell 
&gt;from the owners manual and Bentley, this is the control for the 
&gt;auxiliary heater , or heater booster as its called in Bentley (82-12).  
&gt;I do get air out of the vents behind the front seats, but its not warm. 
&gt; My question is, is this heater a common option, as I haven't seen much 
&gt;mention of it anywhere in the list archives, and is it worth it to try 
&gt;to get it working?  It looks pretty complex and possibly dangerous if 
&gt;not working properly. 

WARNING: ON WATERBOXER VANAGONS THIS LITTLE GREEN KNOB IS THE &quot;SELF DESTRUCT&quot;
BUTTON. DO NOT TURN THIS DEVICE ON... CALL  ME IMMEDIATELY AND I WILL DRIVE DOWN
TO YOUR HOUSE AND REMOVE THIS DANGEROUS DEVICE BEFORE IT DESTROYS YOUR
VANAGON............


(and then I'll put it in my van....   :&lt;)
