Did you do the radio swap your self? I want to do the same but have not
figured out how to get the radio out of my 95 Eurobago.

Also does any one out there have the CD changer in a Eurovan, especially a
Eurobago?  Where is the changer mounted?

Thanks

95 Eurobago,
Learned to drive on an 1958 Type2 with all the little windows around
the top, and a sun roof.
