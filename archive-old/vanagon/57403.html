Subject: friday dinner time/pinnacles


So many people cannot leave to get to Pinnacles until the end f
their work day, around 5 p.m., that I propose we plane for Friday
dinner to be on the late side, say after 8:30 or so.  Saturday
we can do it at a more traditional time, since the time pressure
will be gone on that day.


Remember not to arrive after 11 p.m., or you won't be able to
get into pinnacles.  Look for group campground and a lot of VW's.

See you there...
