Subject: GEX update...

Howdy!

Some of you may remember my previous post praising GEX (if not their 
product).  I still think they're running an outfit with good customer 
service in mind.  But due to my recent experiences (most notably my 
engine dying after 15,000 carefully driven miles) my opinion of the 
engines built by them and purchased by me is becoming less 
enthusiastic.  My newest (2nd) engine has been installed and runs 
fanstastic!  Lots of power!  Runs smooth!  Runs quiet!  Only leaks 
about a quart of oil a week!  Gotta love it!  The fellas at the shop 
cite &quot;weeping pushrod tubes&quot; as the source of my irritation.  
I found GEX on the web:
http://www.gexintl_dot_com/
and fired off e-mail to the warranty department.  I was gentle, yet 
firm.  I mentioned that I'd give them a call the next day(which was 
last Monday) and follow up on the letter.  To their credit, they 
called me at about 9:00 am on Mon. and were quite accomodating.  They 
(hopefully) sent new tubes to the shop and are taking care of about 
2/3 the labor cost.  I thought that part sucked.  I paid for new 
tubes which were actually bad, and now I get to pay again for more 
tubes which I can only hope are good.  I didn't say that on the phone 
though, because I'm weak.  Anyway, I'll update as things progress.
 
On a more positive note, thanks to those that gave advice, I may have 
figured out what I am driving.  If a Safare hightop means that the 
roof of the bus is about 3 feet above the gutter line, then I got 
one.  The top 3' of my bus is fiberglass and is an excellent 
simulation of a kite when driving the Columbia River Gorge.  It's 
often more like piloting than driving.  I got a bed up top and a bed 
down below.  A sink, an electric fridge (that works perfectly and 
keeps beer cold).   Behind the passenger seat is a small square box 
with a cushion that lifts off to reveal yet more storage.  The 
fridge, sink, (no stove) countertop and closets/storage places are 
all behind the driver.  If I knew where to find the serial #, I'd 
tell you what that was too.  The year is '79.  Color is brown.  
Perfect, straight body.  Some paint chips on the nose, etc..but the 
spare tire on the front provides some protection.

Ok, sorry.  I've painted enough of a picture for you.
