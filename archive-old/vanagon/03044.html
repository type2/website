&gt;I believe the oil cooler for air cooled engine is for cooling the oil. The main
&gt;purpose is to prevent oxidation and vaporization of the oil. As far as cooling
&gt;the engine, it really relies on the cooling air blown by the cooling fan.
&gt;
Yes, I would agree with this statement. You want to cool the oil for its
own sake, to avoid thermal breakdown for example. Hence even if a
synthetic oil does not absorb as much heat as conventional oils, this will
not significantly affect the engine's working temperature. On the other hand,
synthetic oil still lubricates satisfactorily at high temperatures.

Aside from thermal breakdown, what are the other dangers of hot engines?
