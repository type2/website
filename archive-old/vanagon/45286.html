There!  That enuf tags for ya?

Anyway, got a bit more done on the '54 tonight, getting the rest of the
passenger side longitudinal cut off and the rear section of the new one
welded on.  Next time I can get the front section on, and then start
fabricating the section in front of the cargo floor, and then...
