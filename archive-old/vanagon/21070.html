Subject: PVC pipe awning trick

Several weeks ago, some one suggested that a simple awning could be
fabricated for cheap by cutting through one side (lengthwise) of a pvc pipe
and attaching it on top of the rain gutter with your favorite tarp placed
(trapped) in between. Cherry and I went camping last weekend and used the
pvc pipe awning set up with great results! I took the time to file or round
off the sharp corners/edges that were left behind by the table saw. I also
opened up/rounded off the ends of the pipe by creating a little &quot;v&quot; that
stradles the cut by 1/4&quot; on either side off the cut and is at sort of a 45
degree angle. The V cut helped to attach the pipe to the gutter. There is no
reason to run/slide the pipe down the length of the rain gutter. The pipe
slips neatly into place and holds firm. There was no sign of scratching the
paint. I used 3/4&quot; schedule 40 pipe. The 10 foot length needs to be cut down
to the length that you think is right. Exact science is not needed for this
application. Use ropes and trees or tent poles for the other end of your
awning. This set-up appears to work on all years and the price is right. Ms.
Martha would have been real proud of us.

Big thanks to whomever made the original suggestion! =))
