Subject: Middle Seat for Slae/Trade

     I don't need my middle seat!(84 Vanagon GL)
     I would like to swap for cabinets/Weekender Rear Seat, etc.
     Of course, $$$ is cools too.

Oh yeah before I forget: (Amusing story)
     
     On my recent trip across the country, I started to notice spots on the 
lower hatch of the Vanagon.
Unfortunaley, the spots got numerous as I went along. I decided that it was 
either oil or coolant and was terrifeid for about 800 mi. before I relaized 
that it was fluid from the rear washer that just splattered back onto the 
hatch! ( God, How dumb!) Oh well, so at least I figured that one out!

Ciao,

Matt
