&gt;&gt;That's crazy!!!
&gt;
&gt;Forgive me for butting in, particularly as a newbie, but why not just 
&gt;do it yourself?  Oil changes are simple, even for the 
&gt;non-mechanically enclined.  I had to make a new filter wrench for my 
&gt;wife's Saab, but it can be done.
&gt;
&gt;Having said all this, I dunno how hard it is on a VW bus.

You need to remove the engine.
