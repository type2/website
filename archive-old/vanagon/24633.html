Subject: Re: Waving Vanagon drivers (again)


&gt;I have stopped waving, noone usually notices.._dot_usually i flash my high beams
&gt;twice at oncoming busses of all types. and i have got a flash back from a
&gt;eurovan, and numerous vanagons but not too many breadloaves.. 


*EVERY* breadloaf in the UK waves, flashes and generally goes mental at the 
sight of another. So do most other air-cooled VWs, especailly custom ones, 
and even quite a few people who are not even in cars. I don't think I've 
ever had a Vanagon driver wave though.
