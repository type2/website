Subject: VW Radio Removal

Is there a simple way to remove those 'theft-proof' VW radios without 
damaging the dash or radio (and without the 'secret' factory too&gt;?  I've 
got a '91 Westphalia and I want to tap into the antenna line to allow 
attachment of a marine band scanner to allow monitoring fishing vessels 
during a west coast trip next week.  I've meant to due this for a while 
now - it worked great with my 82 (easy to pull radio).
