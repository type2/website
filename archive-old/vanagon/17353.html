Subject:       SOTO big meet?

Howdy all.

As usual, in my spot out in the dark, I heard from a friend that 
there is a big SOTO meet in June in the LA area.  Does this sound 
right?  I think I'll go down to get some parts for the '57.

Quick question for the old bus guru's.  Are the bullet turn signals 
supposed to be clear plastic, or the yello plastic?  I've see both 
types, just not sure what kind I should have.

BTW, if anyone comes across some old (50's) bumpers give me a yell!  
I'll pay the proverbial big bucks! &lt;grin&gt;

Thanks!
