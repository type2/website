&gt;He's also spotted a Mercedes Benz Westfalia, a 207 D,
&gt;for $8500 or so. Original owner. Anyone recognize this
&gt;model designation? It is less powerful than a 240 D sedan?

Bill,
the 207D is the main-staple MB Transporter. Front engine,
I think precisely the one out of the 240D sedan. Lotsa
space, pretty low, decent acceleration but low top speed
due to short gears. Should be relatively economical. Jens.
