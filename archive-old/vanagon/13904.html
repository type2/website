Subject: A 1979 camper needs your help!

I have found a '79 camper that I would like to buy. The only 
noticeable problem with it, besides the Ohio state body work  
(rust), is that it lacks an engine. I was wondering if anybody 
out there would know what size engine would work with 
the least amount of modifications to the existing manual 
transmission. The original 2.0l GE engine is a scarce comodity 
in these parts and seems to be very costly to maintain.

The local junkyard only has one bus and it is a '77 with a 
1.7l BC engine. I did notice a '72 Porshe 914 with the engine 
still in place ( I couldn't read the engine code). The junkyard 
dude said that the costs would be US$200 and $400 respectively. 
I'm not really sure if either of these engines would match-up 
properly with the existing transmission. 

I could resume my search, if I knew which engines to look for. 

Please help me snatch another bus from the jaws of death. 

With your kind help and guidance another VW bus will 
live to celebrate its next birthday.
