Subject: re: Subarus in VWs ?!!?

I think I've asked this before, but I'll try again:

Has anyone putting a Jetta 4 cyl gas engine in a Vanagon, possibly 
using the diesel van mounts, oilpan and tranny? This would seem to me a much 
more suitable a conversion since some factory parts are already made, 
but then again, I'm just a vanagon newbie!

This is one swap I would consider, since Jetta engines are cheap, 
powerful, strong and easy to work on. And you could even get a 5sp 
with the deal! (yeah, I know the base 1.8 is only 90-100hp, but that 
can be bumped, or start with a 2.0l)
Between myself and my Dad, we've had 4 Jetta/Golfs run to well over 
200k with ANY engine work, so I'd trust a VW to outlast a subaru...

Any thoughts here? Has anyone done this?

I haven't lost my mind;  I'm sure it's backed up on tape somewhere!
