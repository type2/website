As far as I know, there are no adjustments or maintainence for this beast. 
As far as troubleshooting, I guess it depends on the problem. They are 
enabled via a vacuum-servo mechanism that is controlled by a switch on the 
dash. If yours is not working, I'd check out the servo mechanism first. If 
that's OK, then the problem is internal to the tranny and is expensive to 
fix. Dennis Haynes (DHaynes57_at_aol_dot_com) probably knows all about this if you 
need some real help.
