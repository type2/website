Subject: Karmann Web Server up


As I stated earlier one of the Eurovan Camper factories is finally up
on the WWW. You will find Karmann history at

http://www.karmann_dot_de/003.htm

but there are no information about the Eurovan itself. But you will
find a lot of convertibles they built in the past from 1949 (beetle)
passing 1983 (Escort) to 1996 (Mercedes SLK).

You will find a lot of addresses of Karmann all over the world at

http://www.karmann_dot_de/006.htm

This site is in German language and basically built for introduction
of the whole company's structure, not on their products.

Helmut
'80 Camper
