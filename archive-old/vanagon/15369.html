Subject: Re: Replacing Stock 82 Van mirrors w/stronger model

Hi Matt! 
 
I had the same problem with my 84 Vanagon.  I simply put some hose clamps
around the ball joint of each mirror, adjusted the mirrors to the right
position and tightened the clamps up. 
 
Not pretty, but works fine for now. 
 
Walter
