I wasn't going to take the bolts in the wheel off.  I think this (the cv
joints) is a job I can do without my dad, and I don't want to waste too
much of his time on extra stuff.  I think I'll go with the jackstands.

One more question.  Is it critical that I get the flywheel 
retainer tool- or is that something I can wing?
