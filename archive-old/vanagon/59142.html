Subject: Propane gas gauge info

Thanks to everyone, and there were a lot of you, that answered my question
about installing a propane gas gauge on the Westy.  Apparently that won't
do much good as the general feeling on this is that it measures only
pressure, not content and the pressure doesn't drop much until you run
out...not quite the way I wanted it.  Someone suggested one of those strips
that change color.  That's ok but hard to read.  For everyone that camps
with a 20 lb. gas bottle for a stove or light we used a trick years ago. 
Just look at the bottle after the sun goes down and it gets a little cooler
- you will see very clearly how much you have left in the tank. One part of
the tank sweats the other doesn't.  You can also find out by pouring hot
water down the side of the tank, works the same way. 
Again thants for all the info.
