&gt; I have a '72 with the standard T4 1700 engine.  I was wondering first 
&gt; of all, where is the predrilled mounting spot on the heads for a temp 
&gt; sensor?  When i got the bus it had a non functioning cyl head temp 
&gt; gauge.  It turns out that the power and everything is hooked up to it 
&gt; and if i ground out this one haging wire it pegs the needle.  There 
&gt; may just be a sensor back there some where.  Aside from that, I was 

It's under the upper engine tin on the left side.  Unfortunately it's
really difficult to take that tin off with the engine installed.  Also,
the older carburated type IV engines may not have the hole for the
sender tapped, but it's easy enough to do that yourself.

&gt; wondering how much setups for  cyl head temp
&gt;                                oil temp  and 
&gt;                                oil pressure
&gt;                                               would cost and the best 
&gt; way/place to install that pressure sensor.

About $60 per setup for VDO.  Installation has been discussed here before -
check the archives.
