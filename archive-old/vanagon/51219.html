&gt; I'm responding to this topic for a couple of reasons;
&gt; 
&gt;   I've had H-4's in All of my VW's for the last 3 years!
&gt;   They work quite well.  I've never had any problems with the law due to
&gt; their brightness, but when the slower driver is in front of you and you
&gt; flash him/her with your high beams becareful not to sunburn their necks!
&gt;   I paid $26.00 for my H-4's and their still that price today.
&gt;   I know many people with late model Vanagons have discussed changing to
&gt; early model grills and installing these bulbs, this works great to as
&gt; some of us know.
&gt;   I have some early model grills if anyone is interested.

I like 4 square eyes but I also like to see.
Is there any hope for increased candle power for the 4's without
changing grills?
