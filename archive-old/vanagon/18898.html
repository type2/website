Subject: Leaning Vanagons

I have that same problem with the leaning Type II. I guess the cabinets and
equipment on the left side of the bus weigh heavily on the suspension.

You know, a VWOA rep once gave me (abandoned) plans for the Eurovan camper
which had the kitchen in a &quot;U&quot; shape at the rear of the van. You didn't have
a rear hatch, but the weight distribution problem was solved
(don't know if I'd like that or not).

Hey, you could just get bigger tires on the left side of the bus!     ;-)
