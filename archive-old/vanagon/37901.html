Subject: VW fortune!


I guess some &quot;free VW&quot; luck rubbed off on me yesterday!
My neighbors told me they have an old beetle engine behind their house 
and I can haul it off.  It &quot;fell out&quot; of its Bug about 1.5 years ago.  
The Bug was later stolen, and the engine forgotten.  It seems a bit 
weathered, but it IS a dual port with all of the tin and such.  Heat 
exchangers look to be in fair condition, too.  Only thing missing 
appeared to be the carb.  That's MY luck story.

Of course... My brother's roomie just bought a '68 standard bus for one 
dollar.  Not running, but everything is there..  If he gives up on the 
project, I offered to give him a %500 return on his investment.  heh.
