Subject: Diesel pans, Reimo catalogs, Sami's rear-axle noise

	Stuart H.
	Shouldn't that 1.6 Diesel oil pan be same as a diesel Rabbit,
and available at the local pick-n-pull for about $10? Alternately,
have you considered having the right size Time-Cert installed after
having it overbored and threaded? Big bucks, but it'll never fail again...

	Andy E. 
	I've never heard of Reimo- my office copy of Dune Buggies and
Hot VWs doesn't show a listing for them either. Any info on their
USA agents would be appreciated!

	Sami,
	Have you got a verdict on the rear-axle noise yet?

	Dave Black, 
	Did you ever get your engine fixed?


	Re frozen spark plugs:
	For my sins, I once cross-treaded a plug in my first
car, a '67 Corvair. Having realized what I'd done, and it being a
new plug, I decided it was a 'lifetime' plug and left it. It still
bothers me. Since then, I've always used Anti-Seize on plug threads and spun
'em backwards by hand and made sure they go in many turns by just fingers
and checked the angle in a most paranoid fashon. 

	The original poster had 1500 miles on his frozen plug, which 
leads me to ask, &quot;Why do you know its frozen?&quot; eg- why try to take it 
out in the first 1500 miles since it went in? Sounds like there is more to
this story. If I had a frozen plug at 1500 miles, I'd be another
4500+ miles down the road before I found out! Do you suspect there
is something wrong with this one? Is that when you discovered it
was frozen? 

	To the guy who felt his frozen plug was related to his 
later dropped valve in the same head, the theory is that it was firing weakly, 
you'll get a big carbon build-up and I guess that could isulate the valve 
from the seat and THAT could cause heat damage? By itself, a frozen
or cross-threaded plug isn't going to cause any problem that I'm
aware of- spark'll be in about the right place, metal-to-metal
contact with the head will be good by definition :)


	I'm stil working too hard, not working on my pick-up, its still
(STILL) not on the road- just waiting for the sheet-metal welding. Oh
well. Nice to read this list while waiting for compiles, etc. I've gotta
learn to weld.

	Bill

	Here's a non-VW .sig I thought some of us might also like:

F&quot;I am one of those zealots who would have a special corner of Westminster 
Abbey for the honoured bones of the men who brought to perfection this 
slender, whippet thing of steel and rubber that carries a man far and 
fast by his own glad effort, on the open road, and takes him away from 
his cares as nothing else can.&quot;  --Twells Brex
