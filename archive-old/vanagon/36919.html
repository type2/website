Subject: RE: '87 Syncro

     Christian,

     $9,400! D'oh!... not only did I just part out an '87 Syncro with
     engine problems, I bought a Syncro in the NW and drove it to the East
     coast!

     Surely, I could be the one making mistakes. Here that '87 Syncro
     would sell for $4-5K, though it would take you a while to find it,
     i.e. a couple of months. But closer to you, Tom B. had an '86 Syncro
     Westie for sale for $12,500, and someone recently reposted an ad from
     Colorado for a 90 at about $10K. I know the NW is the Syncro market
     hotbed, but I still think the price is high.

     Tom F.
     90 Syncro Westie
     90 Audi 200 TQW
