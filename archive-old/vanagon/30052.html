From: &quot;SL. Gallagher&quot; &lt;pl2018_at_bristol.ac_dot_uk&gt;
Subject: My new mail address
Date: Sun, 3 Dec 1995 22:49:55 +0000 (GMT)

Due to unfriendly university sysops who think getting more than 2 messages a
day is being too popular, I shall henceforth be known as 
&quot;Sarah&quot;
100655.3340_at_compuserve_dot_com
for the purposes of the list.

But you can still mail me at my old address (this one).

Seeya!

Sarah.
