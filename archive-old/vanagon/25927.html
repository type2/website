&gt;        You shouldn't compare auto insurance with gambling.  We can
&gt;choose to gamble.  Auto insurance is mandatory.  Gary Gibson


We choose to drive.

I know, life is a lot tougher without driving. But it's still a choice.
Alternatives can be developed-- most people in Manhattan don't even own
cars, for example. They have heavy doses of buses, subways, etc., which
are expensive to build. But the point is, they manage.

Personally I think cars are better (duh!). But cars entail risks, to others
as well as to me, and I must take responsibility for the risks I foist
on the people around me, by driving my car near theirs. Insurance co's
enable me to do that.

BTW, Auto insurance is NOT mandatory in most states, including California.
What is mandatory for drivers, is that they demonstrate ability to pay for
the potential damage they may do in driving theri cars. They can do it by
buying insurance, or by showing they have like $300,000 ready and waiting
in assets (bank accounts, bonds, etc.). Most of us can't do that, of
course, so this is a minor quibble.

All in all, insurance is mandatory ONLY for those who choose to put others
at risk by driving. I have no problem with that.
