Subject: Re: List Bumper Sticker?

How about a bumper sticker that simply states the list's email address?

I wouldn't go for any nerdy bumper sticker with some corny/cutsy saying on it.
Please avoid references to the Information Superhighway too, as I'd
probably try to run you off the road.

My only bumper sticker sez, &quot;0 to 60 in 15 minutes&quot;
