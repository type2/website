Subject: Nice Bus, the book

Dear listmembers-

I am writing a book about VW buses (pre-vanagon, sorry, nothing personal). 
The idea behind the book is to solicit answers to survey questions I 
developed with the help of a number of friends. The survey is available
as an on-line fill-out form on the Web at:

http://www.princeton_dot_edu:80/~sean/index.html

This is the address of the Nice Bus home page, the survey can be found by 
hyperlinking through the Nice Bus link (first one on the page) and you will 
see the place to click to go to the on-line form. (The Nice Bus page 
works fine with Netscape and Mosaic 2.something.)

If you do not have access to the WWW and would be willing to fill out a 
survey for the book, I will mail you a copy with a self addressed stamped 
envelope so you can return the survey with the minimum of hassle. 
Although I am on the list, if you want to get the survey it would be 
easiest for me if you write to me directly with your address (which will 
be kept confidential). My e mail address is:

sean_at_princeton_dot_edu

I have started to collect some random bits of trivia about buses on the 
Nice Bus home page as well, such as, other bus web sites and which movies, 
book and magazines have buses in them. For example: In the Clint Eastwood 
movie, Magnum Force, Dirty Harry sideswipes a blue and white splittie in 
the final chase scene. OR: As a college student in the 60's, Robert 
Redford, a computer guru, drives a splittie in the beginning of Sneakers.

I will keep list members appraised of the progress on the book as things 
develop. Initial developments include offers of assistance from survey 
respondents who are professional illustrators and who work for book 
publishers!

Thanks in advance for your help, happy driving,

Sean O'Bus
