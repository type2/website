Subject: RE: [T2] Discount Tires (and Snows!) for Busses

I can comment on Woo-Sung. I bought a 79 Westy that had the Woo-Sung
reinforced tires Load Range C on them, and couldn't figure out why my Westy
behaved so badly. Took it to my local tire store, and they showed me 3 of
the 4 tires had started to seperate, and you could feel the bumps in the
tread where the inner belts were coming apart. These tires looked like they
had at least 1/2 their tread left.



Went to Costco and bought their Kirkland Load Range C tires and had no
problems after that.

&gt; This gets me to wondering who is the actual

&gt; manufacturer ofthe Korean &quot;Capitol&quot; tires I

&gt; purchased for my Westy earlier this year.

 

 

They could be anyone's, but my best guess would be Woo Sung, one of several

Korean companies that do a lot of private-labeling of tires for discount

chains, etc. I don't know much about Woo Sung and couldn't comment on their

quality. Unlike Hankook, who is an OEM supplier to Volkswagen (and other

European and American auto manufacturers), Woo Sung is an aftermarket tire

producer.
