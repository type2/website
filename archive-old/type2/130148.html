Subject: Automatic Transmissions

This morning I was lost in thought when it occurred to me that VW
produced honest to goodness auto trannies for aircooled engines. I had
always known about the pseudo auto stick shifts that bugs had, but I
know nothing fully automatic trannies.

Does someone have knowledge of the types of auto trannies that were
produced for aircooled engines? How many gears did they have? What type
of engines would they fit?

Steve
