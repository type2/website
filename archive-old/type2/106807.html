&gt; I've had good success on several Busses with lubrication only. The first thing

&gt; Do the same

&gt; lube the
&gt; rear latch. I start with WD40 to loosen up the 30 year old factory lube. Then
&gt; spray
&gt; something a little thicker in there, like bicycle chain lube, to keep it
&gt; permanently
&gt; loose.

VW doesn't really explain what to do about the channels. Grease is a good
idea, lithium grease is a little too liquid and will come out and make a
mess. Oil is a mistake.

VW says to put two drops of motor oil in the oiling holes of the hinge
regularly. The hinge in under a lot of spring tension and when you depress
the handle the door should pop out and start sliding on it's own (especially
if you are on a slight decline, or have a sagging rear suspension).
