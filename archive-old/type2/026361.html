The vehicle already has a '79 tranny in it.  You'd be surprised with the
VR6.  It has a short deck height and isn't very long at all.

Very difficult from what I have read.  A 70 had a 1600 in it, and the engine
bay would really need a working over, the tranny is no where near able to
handle the power you are about to give...Suggestion...find a mid bay from
the late 70's and put the Porsche Motor in there.

VR6 will not happen.

Subject: [T2] 411 412 Engine conversion


&gt;
&gt; Hello List(ees),
&gt; I am seeking knowledge (no, not enlightenment...yet) and advice on an
engine
&gt; transplant from a 411/412 to a '70 Bus.  The engine is in a low mileage
&gt; vehicle, still owned by the original owner's family.  What I am curious
&gt; about are the engine specifics.  I was hoping to grab a 2.) 914
&gt; case/longblock, and rebuild it to push my Big Green Behemoth (I mean it in
&gt; the most loving of ways).  Another question is regarding the braking
system
&gt; on these.  Are the calipers the same as the late Bay's?  Are they
&gt; proprietary only to the type 4XX's?  They're rather large, so I am
positive
&gt; they aren't the same as the type 1's and 3's.  I am going to attempt a
CIS-E
&gt; injection setup on the motor eventually as well.  Short of the type 4
&gt; changeover, I'm leaning more and more toward a VR6 conversion.  Any help
or
&gt; advice both on and off list is welcome.  Thanks!
&gt;
&gt; Eron
&gt;
