&gt; So here I am, aged 40, with a 79 Westphalia that I love dearly and a
&gt; slight (very slight) desire to get my nails a bit banged up. I'll be
&gt; honest though, I'm afraid of making any repair I attempt worse. Here's my
&gt; questions for the list.
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Should I even bother? I can afford most of the repairs needed. Will I
&gt; get that much pleasure from my own graft?

I do very little engine work to my '79 Westy, it makes regular visits to
the shop if it needs it or not. I do occasionally do other types of
mechanical work: replacing the wiper motor, resealing fresh air flaps,
replacing propane tank valve, etc. I do get a lot of pleasure out of
these activities, and a sense of accomplishment, but mostly I get
somewhat of an idea of what my Westy is up to. If I had the space, I
would probably do more work myself, as the shop does get expensive.

&gt; 2) If I am to enter this dark greasy world, what basic tools do I need?

I have the most basic of tools, because I only do the most basic of
repairs.
 
&gt; 3) What would be the first job I should attempt? I think my front wheel
&gt; bearings might be going out... When I corner at speeds over 20mph, I hear
&gt; a lower, sort of growly noise.

I've done this on my Bugs, but paid to have it done on the Camper.
 
&gt; I'm pretty good with electrical stuff so suggestions more in the
&gt; mechanical realm are probably more appropriate.

I wired in an extra 15 plug (double), with each controlled by a separate
switch, so we can have a light plugged in (when hooked up to shore
power), we can flip it off without getting up at night. Kind of a basic,
easy thing, but for me, something to be proud of, and certainly
functional.

&gt; What have I let myself in for :)

Probably a wonderful adventure, enjoy it!
