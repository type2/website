I thought just the same thing when I met him at the Eureka Springs meet in
the summer of 1997. You meet 999 people who are very physically attractive,
and they are vacuous wastes of space because they're used to being coddled
and revered, and then you meet number 1000 and there is nothing affected
about him and all your stereotypes are blown to shit.

Josh could have been a model, he had eyes the color of sanded steel, you
should have seen it. But he wasn't a pretty-boy, there was nothing he would
rather do than climb under a bus with you and get greasy.

He came here to Memphis in the winter of 97 to pick up his latest
acquisition, which was Joe Fournier's High Karma Westy, and I saw him again
then. He hauled the bus back to Oklahoma and spent several months and
probably over a thousand dollars restoring it--in order to give it away as
a Christmas present to his best friend.

Saw him again in the hot summer of 98, went to look at a bus he'd bought as
part of a big stash. It might have been the Pandora bus if it had had a
rear drivetrain.

If he liked you Josh was generous to an uncommon degree, with parts and
hospitality and time and stories and of course with beer, rivers of it,
always, always beer around. I hope he was sober when he made the last
decision of all. I suspect he was not. He always treated me like I was the
brother he hadn't seen in ten years.

The entire time he's been keeping the type2_dot_com Library for us, collecting
stuff he thought was useful as a resource. An effort like that requires
uncountable hours, you can't know unless you've done it, it has to be an
effort of love or none of this stuff happens because there is no other
compensation for it.

I chattered continually with him in email through the years, same as I do
20 other people who I like to talk to and bounce ideas off, the constant
babble of life. Three days ago he was uploading stuff to my site, we were
talking about how his code was mostly broken and would have to be redone.
You talk about every incidental thing. No sign. No clue. I don't know what
it was, but he didn't confide it.

Josh Rodgers was my friend.

Erin and I talked but I don't see how we can make the funeral. We'll
negotiate again tomorrow, maybe find a way. I really want to be there, as
unpleasant as funerals are. Josh was a very bright star in my universe and
I need to acknowledge that even though it's after the fact. He was one of
about a dozen people in an orbit that I can turn to, now it's fractured. I
am crying as I write this. Goodbye Josh. Be safe.
