Subject: Busses over the Bridge 2000-The Millenium Run

Well over 100 Volkswagens, including 78 busses of all years-from an early 
East German built Dormobile to a late model Euro-bago -made the run over the 
Sunshine Skyway Bridge spanning the mouth of Tampa Bay. Wowsers. A Great time 
was had by all. Splits, Loafs, Vanagons, Euros, Bugs, Sand rails, Jettas, 
GTI's, T3's -you name it, it was there. Including an absolutely amazing 61 
DeLuxe bus. I tried to count the windows, but there were so many people 
oohing and aahing, that I kept losing count. Most of us convoyed over the 
bridge to the meeting point, and then we all convoyed back to Fort DeSoto 
Park for a picnic. We quite literally brought traffic to a standstill. Folks 
along the roadway, and fishing on the approaches to the bridges we crossed 
waved, shouted, honked, took pictures and video. 
Then, food, a raffle, [three hundred prizes- you think I'd'a won sumpin&quot;!!] 
swapping stories and checking out other folks rigs. My wife, never all that 
enthusiatic about VW stuff, actually had a good time. And said so. Like I 
said: Wowsers.
Busses by the Beach in June! Okay!
