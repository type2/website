Subject: Re: [T2] fan shroud flaps

I'll chime in on this one because I haven't seen a complete answer yet.
Karl is very close with his statement that they keep the hot air from
flowing back through the fan shroud while using a BA6 with the engine off
(they most definitely do).  But what about all of us without BA6 gas
heaters?  The answer is, they do essentially the same thing for us!

When you shut off your engine, all that heat radiating from the exhaust
pipes inside your heat exchangers wants to go somewhere.  And since heat
rises, a large portion of it will want to flow back up through the fan
shroud into the engine compartment.  Not something you want on a warm day.  

I have one of those indoor/outdoor thermometers in my 73 Westy with the
&quot;outdoor&quot; sensor mounted inside the engine compartment.  On a nice hot day
(90 F.) I see 102-110 degrees while driving on the highway.  As soon as I
stop and shut off my motor, the thermometer pegs at 120 - I don't know how
hot it really gets in there.  So any extra heat I can keep from going in
there has got to be a good thing.

As to blocking them off, that's the right thing to do if you don't have heat
exchangers.  No sense wasting that extra cooling air and, just like your
engine compartment seal, they keep hot air from re-entering your engine
compartment.  But if you have heat exchangers you do NOT want to block those
off (and if you have them, make sure they swing freely).  The reason is that
the cooling air goes across the HOT exhaust and is vented out the
heater-control boxes.  This keeps your exhaust pipes a little cooler and
plays a very important part in preventing burned exhaust valves.
