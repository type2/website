Subject: Maggie Progress Report: Day 3

Howdy there.  It may actually be day 4 or 5, I'm losing track. No matter.

We left off with the engine out, studs bent.  I ordered parts and they came
in yesterday, so I dutifully went to work today.  Lah-de-dah.

Didn't get much accomplished.  I managed to not get out the rear engine
seal, but managed to rip out the inner part of the thing.  I didn't get the
drive plate off (takes a 9mm 12-point key thing, I guess).  I did get the
CV joints all apart (all 4--woohoo!).  See separate post on that.  I did
discover my rear wheel bearings are completely shot.  I did get really
dirty.  Hmmm, I guess that's about it.  Gotta go to Sears now for tools.

Having more fun than I can stand,
Eric
Maggie
