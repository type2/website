Subject: Re: Buses FS (CT,MA,NY Areas)

Since Ron is getting in to the CT for sales, I'll post mine again, since I
really need to get rid of it.
I'm paying storage for this bus, and the price is down from last time I posted,
only $800. A great bargain. 

The bus has a bad engine, all burnt up. Has good heads and a weber single carb
setup. There is some little surface rust, battery tray is new. The rest of the
bus is really solid. The complete Westy interior is there and in very good
condition. The canvas pop top has some small tears.

I also have, but yet to install
	Front Window seal
	Pop Top Seal
	Extra muffler and heater boxes

This bus just passed CT inspection 6 months ago.... Just needs a new engine and
its ready to go....

The bus is located in Essex Connecticut. I must sell this bus quickly, I'm
asking $800/BO

Email me or give me a call at (203) 484 - 4258 

Thanks ......
