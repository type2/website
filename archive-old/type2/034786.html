&gt;  Hi everyone, 
&gt;              Last weekend I had the motor in my bus blow up. I checked out 
my 
&gt; 
&gt;  options and looked at my finances. I found a motor out of a beatle and I 
was 
&gt; 
&gt;  just wondering if I could use that in my bus. I am aware that the rear 
mount 
&gt; 
&gt;  is different and I found an adapter kit to remedy that problem. I was just 
&gt;  wondering if all the bug engines were the same? And if not what years 
can't 
&gt; I 
&gt;  use? Also I was wondering what modifcations if any need to be made. I am 
&gt;  short on cash right now because of school starting back up and I am hoping 
I 
&gt; 
&gt;  can get away with using this beatle motor. Thanks for your help, also many 
&gt;  thanks to those who responded to me earlier about my engine choices.

Not all Beetle engines were they same - firstly they varied from 900cc to 
1600cc and your bus will certainly struggle with less than a 1600 single port 
engine, and a 1600 dual port is preferable.
1600 twin port engines were used from the early 70's right through to current 
production but a single port engine may have been upgraded to twin port. or a 
twin port fitted to a much earlier vehicle.

Secondly the engines were produced in many different series, detectable from 
the letters at the start of engine number. Common ones are B, AD, AE, and AS 
but there are others (my current engine is a UGA). Some engines series were 
used in Beetles and busses some in just one or the other. Each engine series 
has a different timing specification which varies between bus and beetle and 
can even change in mid series (eg AD engines).

A book such as John Muirs &quot;idoit book&quot; will give you timing details for the 
'same' engine in different vehicles so will enable you to make (if necessary) 
an educated guess to the timeing to use with a Beetle only engine in a bus. 
This will be a staring point from which you can make minor adjustments to 
balence out ease of starting, drivability, and heat production

Good luck
