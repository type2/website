Subject: propane fridge

Hi,
I heard somewhere that some of the vanagons had fridges that run off of 12v 
or propane.  I was wondering if it is 12v or propane OR 12v and propane.  
Basically, can I set one up by my lake without having to have a battery that 
I will have to recharge or electricity?
Thanks,
Kyle
