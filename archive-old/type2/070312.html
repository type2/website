Subject: Re: Dead Stickers: Probable Cause?

Rumor has it around hear in Maryland if you can get your hands on a 
support our troopers or troopers are our best protection bumper stickers 
the cops tend to leave you alone, i have yet to get one, i Think you have 
to donate to the Troopers Association, I'll ask at the county fair at the 
recoved paraphenia Trailer.

for that reason a friend had an amurrikun flag and an NRA sticker on his car.
   i wonder if the 'be a friend for life, dont drink and drive' sticker has
the same effect?

but i like teddy bears and nifty artwork too and might stick some on, but im
not going to sport something like
'only users lose drugs'
