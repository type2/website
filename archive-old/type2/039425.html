jeff,
.006 would be the correct range, a little looser is
better than a little tight.  while under there, check
for erroneus oil leaks, check out the cv joints, make
sure youre valve cover gaskets are all in good shape
or replace.   check to make sure all tinware is tight
and in place.   just a good visual inspection under
the bus and in the engine compartment to make sure
everything looks ok.   then id go buy a Bentley or
Muir manual and find a nice place to store it in your
bus.   they can be a lifesaver out on the road by
yourself when something comes up, and of course print
out the AIRS list for your travel area.   and most
importantly enjoy that Riviera.
just my $.02

&gt; Sorry I forgot the subject line in the pervious

&gt; 
&gt; Fellow listees,
&gt; 
&gt; I am planning on doing my first valve adjustment
&gt; sometime this week on my 
&gt; Riveria. I am going on a trip this weekend and
&gt; thought I would double check 
&gt; a few things before departing. I was just wanting to
&gt; confirm the size of the 
&gt; gap on the valves for a type 4 1800cc with dual
&gt; carbs. I know a type 1 is 
&gt; ..006&quot; but I just wondered if it is the same on the
&gt; type 4. Also is there 
&gt; anything else I should be looking for while I'm
&gt; under the bus?
&gt; 
&gt; cheers...
