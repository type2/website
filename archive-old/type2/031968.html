&gt; One important thing - If you disconnected the EGR pipe, make sure you plug
&gt; the hole in the manifold or you will have a vacuum leak, lean mixture, and
&gt; major problems...

In my experience wioth my '78 Westfalia, the bus simply will not start if
the hole in the manifold is unplugged (for example, if you completely
remove the EGR valve). It simply sucks too much air. 

as I understand it, the function of EGR is to cool the fires a bit in the 
cylinders by mixing exhaust back into the input stream. Lower burning 
temp = lower NOx emissions. 

The admonition that no EGR = burned valves probably stems from the idea 
that no EGR = higher temperature burning = too much heat for the poor old 
heads to deal with = burned/ dropped/ eaten exhaust valve seats. Although 
I see the logic to it, I've been running with and without EGR for years 
on my '78 bus and I have yet to burn a valve. I also do not notice any 
difference in oil temp (which I might expect if the difference in burning 
temp were substantial?). I also do not notice big differences in fuel 
economy (although this I would have to check more carefully over a range 
of conditions with and without EGR to be sure of). 

I run without EGR periodically because the damn thing cruds up so fast 
that it takes itself offline within about a year after cleaning it up. I 
clean it up every two years so I can pass CA smog. 

I suppose if I really wanted to evaluate its function with and without 
EGR I would readjust the fuel mix every time I take the thing offline (or 
at least measure the change in exhaust gas when I hook it up and 
disconnect it). I presume if I calibrate fuel mix with EGR online and 
later take it offline the mix will be a little richer than optimum 
because I'm not diluting it with more gases inserted beyond the air flow 
meter. 

You actual milege may vary.
