Bobb,
  To remove the round plate on the right hand side of the engine compartment,
use a screw driver to pry it off evenly.  There is nothing else holding it in.
If you had FI, you would also have to remove the computer so you can see the
fuel filler connections.  NOTE:  Make sure your gas tank is less than 1/4 full.
To remove the wall b/t the tank and the engine compartment, there are two screws
that are reached from the bottom of the bus (get on your back).  They are near
the bottom edges of the panel and are accessible with a longish screw driver.
To remove the the panel without removing the engine is possible.  I posted a how
to on replacing the fuel neck filler, which I suggest you do if you go to the
trouble of removing the said panel.  Search the archives for Fuel Neck Filler.
It also explains in detail how I removed the rear gas tank panel.  Or more
importantly, how I reinstalled it.  Having done it once, I could do it again in
two hours easily.  Probably spent four hours the first time, as I was also
helping a friend install an A/C blower in an Audi 5kqt (an even larger PITA).
If anyone needs the how to article, pmail me and I'll send it out too.

&gt; Hello.  Vehicle: type 2 ,2 litre,  *NOT* fuel injected, 1979.    Right , I
&gt; am now, literally , having bad dreams about  my van catching fire.  I want
&gt; to have a look , just a look, at the fuel tank filler hose and also at the
&gt; outlet from the tank and any vent outlets etc. that might deserve
&gt; inspection.  There are 3 basic questions I would appreciate an answer to.
&gt; Q.1 The filler hose is apparently visible if the round plate at the right
&gt; hand side of the engine compartment is removed.  I cannot see any screws or
&gt; anything holding it on so I am assuming that it is a matter of levering it
&gt; off,  but before I do that I'd like some-one to confirm that is the case so
&gt; I don't finish up forcing something.  (Any ideas about repair access /
&gt; techniques if required,  please).
&gt; Q.2 Concerns the plate between the engine compartment and the tank.  I want
&gt; to take this off so I can see the tank.  It is held on with screws round the
&gt; edge but having taken all these out, it is still held in quite firmly.
&gt; Again I don't want to force it out if I've missed something that needs
&gt; undoing.  Does anyone have experience of this please.
&gt; Q.3.  How many actual exit  points are there from the tank. You know -
&gt; vents, outlets, etc. and are they all visible if I manage to get that  plate
&gt; off.
&gt; Also, while I'm on the subject of vents - I have noticed recently that there
&gt; often seems to be a smell of fuel coming from the ...(searches for the
&gt; correct term) ..well vents really.  Those slatted sections at the back
&gt; corners, at the top.  I've being trying to get a clear picture in my mind of
&gt; exactly what leads where but  I'm finding it very difficult. I suppose
&gt; everywhere has different emissions  laws leading to different layouts in
&gt; this area of the van.  Mine is for the British  market if that's any help.
&gt; While there seems to be a certain logic in vents for gas expansion finishing
&gt; up smelling of fuel, it seems highly suspect to me and I don't like it at
&gt; all.  I'm not going to try repairing things myself - I don't think this is a
&gt; situation that requires my dubious mechanical skills, but I would like to be
&gt; able to go to a mechanic armed with as much knowledge as possible.  Any
&gt; useful information very  much appreciated.  By the way,  Al Brase,  a
&gt; campaign to prevent people getting burnt and horribly injured or worse is,
&gt; to my mind, very worthy so good on you.  All this stuff about fires makes me
&gt; nervous but it's much better than complacency, eh.  Goodwill to all  and
&gt; thanks again.
