Subject: [T2] Engine Stand

	Hello Everybody.....I just recieved a sale catalog from Harbor
Fright tools. They have an engine stand for under $40.00. Is there any
reason why this would not work for my 1600dp engine? I have seen the VW
specific one that bus depot and others sell for $70.00 and up. Just trying
to save some cash .

Jeff
