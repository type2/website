&gt; I've searched the archives and can't find an answer, so here goes. Can anyone
&gt; tell me the differences between a 1971 Deluxe Bus and a Standard?

While not *exactly* an answer to your question, it might be close enough to
help. Please don't ask me how it is that I remember this but here goes:

For the 68 &amp; 69 model years in Europe there were three trim levels of
windowed busses. They all came with two full width bench seats in the cabin:

Kombi: Like the panel van, there was headlining only in the cockpit. The
interior walls were (I think) lined with particle board like the sliding
door is on the panel van. I don't think it came with a floor mat for the
cabin or trunk dressing. (I remember the sales brochure mentioning one of
the possible applications for the Kombi as &quot;prison van&quot;.) (Again, please
don't ask how I remember a sales brochure that I read over 30 years ago.)

Clipper: Headlining throughout. Vinyl covered walls (like the doors on the
van) throughout. Vinyl covered particle board lining in the trunk and
snap-off covers for the bottom of the side of the middle bench and bottom
front of the back bench. Plastic spare tire cover. Two heater outlets under
the back bench and one facing rearward from the middle of the pass-through
between the front seats. Air duct/armrests on front doors leading to fresh
air vents in bulk heads behind front seats. Three(?) armrests in cabin.
Rubber floor mat in cabin. Vent wings in back left window and sliding door.
Recepticles for nicotine-addict refuse on back of middle bench and front
bulkhead.

Clipper-L (in addition to the Clipper's features): Chrome VW emblem on nose.
Chrome trim on &quot;beltline&quot;. Diagonal chrome bars in trunk (I still don't know
why).

I don't know how this corresponds to models sold in the US.

Hope this helps and isn't tooo exhaustive and if anybody knows what those
diagonal bar are for ...
