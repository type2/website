&gt; I don't know if this has been a subject before. I

&gt; how to prevent my T2a VW Logo from being stolen (the

I think the only logical method is to eliminate the
temptation to steal in the first place. 

If it gets stolen more than once, buy a new one and
only attach it for special occasions...

Sounds kinda crappy, I know. But it's been my
experience that the harder you make something to
steal; the more damage some a-hole will do trying to
get it:-(


I learned this the hard way on my last non-VW; an '89
Ford Probe (I.E., *very* expensive stuff to replace!).
My car was broken into twice by would-be-thieves
wanting my CD-player (or whatever else they could
find). In the process, they ruined my door lock, door
skin and dashboard. Over $1,500.00 damage for a 4 year
old CD player!!!!

The only good thing, is...they never got it. I install
my own stereos, so I make them virtually impossible to
remove...even by me (!). 

That stereo now resides in my bus;-)


Moral of story: I now leave my bus un-locked at night.
I leave nothing in my bus that can't be replaced. I
leave my bus-tools, but that's a lot
cheaper/easier/less-painful than replacing the locks,
doors, windows, etc. 

So far, no problem. I know the law-of-averages will
catch up with me eventually, but as I said; I can
replace the tools/stereo, but replacing the locks,
doors, etc., and having it all match the 30-year old
paint???? No way.

Also, some thieves seem to have a *decent* side, and
will only break-out a wing-window.... Have you ever
tried replacing one in a bus?????!!!!!


I say, if you want it bad enough; take it. Just don't
trash my bus in the process.


PS- some other list member mentioned leaving some
loose change in the ashtray, just to give a thief
something to steal (hopefully preventing them from
doing any more damage because you had the audacity to
waste their time ;-). I do that, too!
