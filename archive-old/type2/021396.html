Subject: helpful vw parts dealer

List:
While at my local VW dealer today looking up Vanagon parts, I realized
the parts man was answering EMAIL! It seems they sell F*rd and other
parts by email.
The parts man there is Marshall and he said he'd be happy to give type 2
list members 10% discount. He's got no bigger stock of old parts than
most any dealer, but does have the parts system and is pretty eager and
persistant in finding parts if they are in the system. I know he was
able to find several obscure parts for a 67 Bug sunroof for me a while
back! If you need help, give Marshall a try! (Tell him Al Brase sent you
and ask for the type 2 list discount.)
The dealer is:
Dick Witham Ford- VW
4617 University Ave.
Cedar Falls, IA 50613
phone 319-277-8123
Marshall's email is: mbmorrill76_at_hotmail_dot_com
