&gt; &gt; When was the last time  you heard of a garbage truck being stolen?!?!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Actually, a garbage truck WAS stolen in NYC a couple of months ago...
&gt; The thief just jumped in while the guys were loading it and drove it a-
&gt; round a few blocks causing quite a bit of damage to everything in its
&gt; path 'til he jammed it amongst some parked cars... ;-(

if your going to steal something at least steal something you can
drive...my van is safe under those conditions,
