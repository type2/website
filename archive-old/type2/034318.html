&gt;All of this is covered on the type2 list's page http://www.type2_dot_com,
&gt;Sean's &quot;Bartnotek&quot; page has helped me alot, see the library for links
&gt;to Sami's AFC troubleshooting page, search the archives, etc. I used
&gt;these web resources (and Muir, Bentley, Haynes) to figure out the FI
&gt;system.

Sami's page is here, it's a little bit buried in the Library so all FI
people might want to bookmark it:

Hmmm....I'm thinking &quot;SamiTek&quot;....hmmmmm.... =^ )
