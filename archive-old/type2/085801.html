&gt;The fuel injection ECU uses a signal from the points to tell it when each

&gt;12 volts - with a points/coil setup you get a spike that is sufficient -
&gt;with the CDI in the circuit the points doesn't drive the coil directly so
&gt;this spike does not occur and so the ECU does not see any ignition events.
&gt;One solution that I have seen work is to hang an extra coil off the points 
&gt;-
&gt;it's only purpose is to create the much needed voltage spike for the ECU.

&gt;I have the same problems with my bus currently - I haven't put on the extra
&gt;coil patch since I am in the process of replacing my stock FI with an
&gt;aftermarket DIY kit.

That is very good to know. How is the peaking coil connected (shunt series) 
and what voltage is ideal? What value coil? Is CDI normally only used with 
carb VW's?

Thanks
