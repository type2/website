Subject: Re: [T2] Insulation, Where??

Chris,

Looked at my local HVAC/plumbing contractors a couple of weeks ago when I 
was on vacation.  

Theirs comes in 2 sizes 1/4&quot; and 1/2&quot;(I think that was it) and in 4'
widths.  Thin tar paper on one side and the insulation appeared to be 
some sort of heavy dark colored fiberglass attached.

Mainly for outside insulation of long duct runs.

I am going to go back to your archived article and try to find the tar 
paper locally tomorrow.

Wish me luck as one of my friends that is a roofer had never heard of the 
stuff....but he offered to do the spray in foam on my bus....I regretfully 
declined&lt;grin&gt;(and he understood).

Cheers, dave

&gt; 
&gt; A local source to check would be commercial HVAC contractors - we have a 
&gt; local service that will allow me to prowl through their warehouse 
&gt; occasionally. They use ALOT of these materials (and better) and will sell 
&gt; you a greater quantity for a lower price.
&gt; 
&gt; Also check refrigeration and electrical supply houses.
&gt; 
&gt; Lastly look for Industrial Rubber and gasket suppliers.
&gt; 
&gt; Typically the commercial guys can sell you vast quantities for a fraction 
&gt; of the price of the catalogs like JC Whitney who are just reselling materials.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Anyone have a source, other than JC Whitney, to look for the Insulation 
&gt; &gt;that has the Felt with Aluminum coating?  I've checked Lowes, Home Depot 
&gt; &gt;and a local Building Supply store and all they have is the Airbubble 
&gt; &gt;plastic with Aluminum.
