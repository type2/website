Subject: Re: VW hall sender

Well... I have a couple of Vanagons (WBX) with the hall ignition.  The system
requires: the hall generator, an ignition amplifier, an idle stablizer and the
special coil. You might be able to pick up the whole system at your local
boneyard for cheap.

Note, I've tried (unsuccessfully) to install the system on my '77.  It will
run, but for some reason, it tells the ECU to go to full rich.  Haven't quite
figured out what the problem is, but I will one of these days.

Karl Von Salzen is the resident expert on this, BTW. I just went through my
address book and I don't have his...  aufever_at_?.  Might search the archives.

&gt; Hi, Does anyone have any experience with the 79 bus hall sender standard for
&gt; that year. I saw it in the VW parts manual. If it fits into a 78 distributor
&gt; would this not be a good substitute to a pertronix? VW quality at the same
&gt; price. What I would like to know is if this sender requires another
&gt; component to function or if it will function alone like the pertronix does.
