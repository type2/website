Subject: Re: [T2] Part numbers for tools



&gt; Erich --
&gt; 
&gt; Please realize that you are not allowed to use any tools bearing VW 
part
&gt; numbers unless you also wear a crisp lab coat like the fellas shown 
in the
&gt; factory manuals.  :-)

Cool!  I have one of those at school.  I also have one in tie-dye, 
which might be even better for working on a bus.

George
