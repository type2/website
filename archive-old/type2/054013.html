Subject: pistons arrived...a question

hey volks,
just a quick question.   my pistons arrived from bus
depot today.   i was taking a look at them and have a
question.   the tops of the pistons (they are the
brazilian replacements) have an aarow on them pointing
a specific direction.   now which way do these aarows
have to point on my engine, right side up facing each
other _-&gt;&lt;-_  not facing each other right side up
_&lt;--&gt;_, or upside down facing each other, upside down
not facing each other.   just curious so i can begin
reassembly tonight!
thanks
