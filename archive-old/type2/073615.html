Subject: Extra dash warning lights

Hi,
I'm from Australia &amp; I'm presently reviving a 72
Single Cab Truck from a sad &amp; sorry state to a daily
driver.
The details are straight forward....1600 engine &amp;
manual gearbox,pretty stock all round really.
Thing is,it has an extra yellow warning light with a
white printed B on it on the dash next to the heater &amp;
vent levers.
Don't get thrown by this pic....the car is right hand
drive,not wrong hand drive...sorry I meant left hand
drive:-)

Any hints on what it does?
I haven't been able to put a battery in &amp; work out
what makes it light up.
:-)
Cheers
Andrew
