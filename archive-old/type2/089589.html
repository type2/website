Subject: Re: [T2] Injector seals

If you have not looked at your seals or know that they have not been
replaced recently, I would get them replaced.  It would perfect timing
as you would have the fuel rail off already for replacing the fuel
lines.  Plus its not expensive but is very effective.  If they have not
been replaced in a while then chances are they have become worn and
cracked which can cause vacuum leaks.  As far as alignment, its pretty
straight forward.  When reinstalling the injectors, the metal piece that
goes arond it and bolts on will align in fairly well.  There may be
other opinions on this?  Never had any problems with it though.
