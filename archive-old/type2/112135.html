Subject: 2 different heater boxes

--- type2-digest-help_at_type2_dot_com wrote: 
&gt; My driver's side and passenger's side heater boxes look different. Most 
&gt; noticably, the drivers side has an oval hole on top thar a pipe connects to. 
&gt; this pipe runs up into the engine compartment. the other end is round and it 
&gt; connects to the little squirrell fan. The passenger side is reverse. It is 
&gt; round at the box at oval at the other end. Also, the one is secured in a 
&gt; coupe more places than the other is.

Sounds about right to me. Here's a pic of my 79 Federal Bus heat exchangers:

Since the 79's have square port heads the exchangers are different then what
you'd see on other baywindows (or aircooled vanagons).
