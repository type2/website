&gt; AAAHHHHAAAA!
&gt; Would this explain the rumbling and general sound of impending bearing
&gt; failure of my newly aquired 38A generator?
&gt;
&gt; I just changed my 30A for a 38A because it had the 38A fan shroud piece
&gt; and was eating fanbelts.  How are the pulleys different?

I was referring to the hub for the fan, not the pulley.  If you use the
38A (dished) tin with the 30A fan hub you will not be able to get the fan
into the shroud as it will contact the inlet duct.  Another way of putting
it is that the fan will have wayyy too much clearance between itself and
the round tin.

The pulley is right if the belt goes straight from the crank pulley to the
generator pulley, as viewed from the side.  You can use a straight edge to
verify this, or just eyeball it.

I'm not a pulley expert, but others on the list are.  There is a claim of
a cast pulley being correct for a 38A generator, but I had a stamped
late-style pulley that lined up perfectly with both the 38A generator and
the alternator.

keep in mind that &quot;bearing noise&quot; might be from another cause, such as
loose tin screws, loose fan or pulley, or a cracked fan.  Give those a
look first!
