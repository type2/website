&gt; I have been having this gas-in-the-oil problem in a 74 westy since I had a

&gt; The electric fuel pump was there when I got the camper.  It is mounted on
the inside lower frame member, lower than the engine and the gas tank.

Joel,

The culprit is the fuel pump.  It delivers 20 - 30 psi, which is required for
the fuel injection system.  You need to acquire an electric fuel pump that
delivers about 3 - 5 psi as that is what is required for a carb.  Most likely
what is happening, is the fuel being delivered by the pump is overpowering the
floats ability to lift the needle valve, and close off the fuel flow.  Replace
the fuel pump, and I would be willing to bet that your gas in oil problem will
be significantly reduced, if not altogether eliminated.

Cheers,

David
