Subject: The Jerome Rally

As a relatively new reader of the type2 stuff, I got all excited to see that a meet of Bus
afficiandos was going to happen at Jerome.  My wife and I made plans to drive down to
attend.  And then, today, I read a post that said that the meet is in Jerome ARIZONA.  I
live in the panhandle of Idaho.  Down in southcentral Idaho, about eight hours from here,
is an old mining town in the mountains named &quot;Jerome&quot;.  Whoops!  Bummer.
