Subject: tuned exhaust manifold for type 4's?

Yes, I can see it every time I look at the back of mine!

There are 2 options here:

1. Fit a 4-1 'sports' header which fits to the original heat exchangers,
costs around £85 including silencer. Exits sideways at tri-flange, sounds
good but adds little/no power (IMHO).

2. Fit a proper merged 4-1 header, like wot the drag racers use, and fashion
some kind of silencer (maybe you can buy a suitable one). This goes straight
onto the heads, adds +5% with silencer, +11% with 'stinger'. Problems? The
long merged section sticks out, so you can't use a tow-bar (in fact, it may
interfere with the valence/bumper, I dunno exactly). No heating either, of
course. Costs around £250, cheaper than replacing stock exhaust and heat
exchangers.

Has anyone seen this type of setup on a type4-powered bus? Could the
headers (i.e., the pipes before the heat exchangers be replaced with a more
sophisticated setup?
