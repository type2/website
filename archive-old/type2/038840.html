The LT series are VW commercial vans. The LT 28 is the small one (still pretty big), LT 35s are bigger.
LTs have front mounted water cooled engines, the gas engines are essentially Audi engines, the diesel engine is a straight six as used in Volvos (open the hood of diesel 240 and you'll see VW signs all over).
If you want to do some serious camping - get the LT. It's on of the best European RVs I know. Plus, you'll have a car to show off at any American VW meeting. On the downside - the LTs are ugly - no design, strictly form follows function. If you think Vanagons are ugly, you'll hate the LT.

Hope this helps,
Marcus (always wanted an LT to haul my band's gear ...)

Hi all;
   Perhaps one of you could give me some idea what a 1976 VW LT28 camper
is. There is one listed for sale in the local classifieds and I don't
have a clue what it is. It's described as being &quot;bigger than a Vanagon&quot;.
Really has me curious. Don't have time to go look at it right now, it's
50 miles away.
   Perhaps one of our European members has an answer?
