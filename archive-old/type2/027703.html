Subject: Sliding Door Track Components on a 72

Can anyone tell me what the Sliding Door track is made up of. I ordered the 
bottom plate and the Inner Rocker. The Guide rail (top part is savable so 
I'm keeping that). I see in Rocky mountain Motorworks that there is any 
Inner sill (L/R) that you can order. Where does that go? And if I have the 
Inner Rocker, do I need that piece. Oh ya, I have the outer rocker too. I 
hope I have it all.

Thanks for any info,

Dave
