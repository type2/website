Subject: Re: [T2] Is it feasible with my bus! (Big winter trip)

Have fun on your trip.  Looks like you've prepared better than I would, and
I've done more winter touring than this trip indicates.

WARNING !!!  If you are going to sleep with the propane heater on please
open both front windows about an inch (2.5 cm) and also open the front fresh
air vent.  If you don't, the heater will burn all the oxygen and you will
DIE.

For winter travel I bought a piece of 4' x 8' x 3/4&quot; white styrofoam from a
hardware store and cut it to fit the ceiling of the pop-top.  A piece of
wood through the pull down handle will keep it in place when down and
another piece upright at the low end keeps it in place while up.

I also bought some double sided aluminum bubble wrap which I cut to fit the
canvas walls.  This folds and stores between the roofs when not in use.

A &quot;T&quot; shaped two piece curtain secured as high as possible and hanging just
behind the front seats and into the rear entry aisle will stop drafts and
the split allows for easy rear access.

You can camp at Wal-Mart and BLM areas at minimul cost and at truck stops.
At truck stops for $5.00 to $10.00 two people can share a shower with towels
supplied and you can also do your laundry.

Pack matches, lighter, candles and clothing for warmth if you breakdown.  A
cell phone and CB radio are also helpfull.  On the Interstate, channel 17 NS
and channel 19 EW, emergency channel 9.

Check valves cold every 3,000 miles and carry enough filters for oil changes
on the road.

Hope some of this helps.

Ian
