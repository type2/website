&gt;This brings up the question of exactly how much of the tin on euro 72 and up buses with stock 1600s is different than regular 1600 tin? Does any one have a diagram form a Euro publication of Bentley or Hanes that they can scan or put up? I have seen some nice homemade patchwork on 72 up buses with 1600s but never seen the real tin.

&gt;Furthermore do Euro 72 and up buses with 1600s use a hanger bar for the motor or does the tranny support the lighter 1600 motor?


On the pictures you can see the spot welded seam between the two pieces 
of sheet metal that it is made of. The front most part is a 'regular' 1600 part, 
the rearmost parts is '72&gt;'79 1600 Baywindow only.

The Euro 1600 does use a rear engine support. It is bolted to the case with 
two M10 bolts, and one M8 bolt. Use original bolts here, I've damaged an 
OP piston bore (right behind the left engine support bolt) with bols that were 
too long. on the ends of the support there are two rubber mounts, these 
mounts are bolted to the chassis member through 4 small brackets, the 
holes in the members are the same for both the T4 ads the T1 engined 
Busses. In fact, the 1600 support seems heavier duty than its T4 counterpart, 
the engine tends to move less than a T4. The engine compartment seal 
is the same for the T1 and T4 engined Busses.
