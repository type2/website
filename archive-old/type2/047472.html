Electronic ignition?  The new module can fail the heat test.  Did it have
similar symptoms before you installed the module?

I've had a new condensor fail after warm up.

The pick up coil in the distributor would be another place to look.

Best to check these items when they are in the fail mode if it is heat related.

Your ignition coil has a set of resistance specs to check.  Those, too, may only
fail when hot.  That VOM meter is sounding like a pretty good investment.

&gt;   Coming down out of a canyon late Sunday
&gt; night, the RPMs dropped to 0 in a split second with no other indications of
&gt; power loss.  I still had power and ignition.  She would turn over but not
&gt; catch.    She ran fine all day and then in the middle of
&gt; the blasted I15 Freeway, she died in the same manner as the night before.

&gt; So, I am assuming, I have spark, I have fuel, I have a new ignition module,
&gt; and I am guessing that it might be the coil as I know that if the coil gets
&gt; hot it might not run and when it is completely cooled it will.  My bus did
&gt; start the next day and thankfully she is sitting in my driveway now.  I hope
&gt; it is the coil because that would be a good project for me to tackle.
