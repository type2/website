Subject: Re: [T2] RE: 85 MPH ?

&gt; My 85 1.9 GL, or my 87 2.1 Westy won't go 85, let alone my 74 Westy---

I have had my '77 up to 85 on a couple of occasions. Always coasting down
a long hill like the North side of the grapevine or Shasta. :) I have
never seen the engine take it up to 85, but I have seen 80 coming down the
long slow grade south on I-5 before the grapevine at night in the middle
of winter with outside temps down in the 30s and no head wind. 

I have Head, Outside/Inside air and Oil temp gauges as well as an Oil
pressure gauge. I monitor them pretty closely. As long as they are all
within acceptable ranges I feel free to put the throttle wherever I want
to with no worries. I am not advising to keep it at WOT all the time
though. When I hit the grapevine I don't keep it at WOT, the gauges tell
me that is too much. I scale back to keep the head and oil temps cool
enough. In the summer time I probably keep it at less then 1/2 when on the
highway, because that is what my gagues tell me to do. Worry less about
speed and more about temperature.

As always, YMMV,
-Nick
