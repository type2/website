Subject: Re: [T2] \What gauge is the wire??

I did something similar and used #2 guage from West Marine (for the better
insulation)

&gt;  I want to put a battery cutoff switch at my driver side seat pedestal base
&gt; (like a boat battery cutoff) to disconnect the battery ground .  This means
&gt; running an appropriate cable from the VW bus (RBC) battery negative ground to the front of the bus and from
&gt; the switch to a ground spot up there.
&gt;
&gt;  Well, this wire will have to be about 11 ft long, so I  went to Home Depot to check what they had.  They had
&gt; a reasonable sized and flexible wire with multi strands.

also used the West Marine cut off switch.
