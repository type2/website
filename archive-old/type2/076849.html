Subject: Australian Meets

Hi guys,
For everyone who either lives in Australia or or will
be visiting the Sydney area on these dates here are a
couple of meets.
On February 24th there is a small club meet in
Wollongong, an hour or so south of Sydney.
It may be run by the Bulli VW Club(Bulli's the suburb,
not just a bus club!) and I'll find out more about the
details &amp; let you guys know.
On 30th &amp; 31st March(the Easter Weekend) are the
AUSTRALIAN NATIONALS!!
The Drag Racing(bracket racing) will be held on
Saturday 30th at Oran Park Raceway near
Camden,south-west of Sydney, &amp; the Show'N'Shine is
held on Sunday 31st at Fairfield Showgrounds in
Sydney's western suburbs.
It should be great couple of days and it's run by Club
Vee Dub, Sydney.
All comers are welcome as well as anyone wishing to be
involved in the swap meet.
Here's some pics of last years Nationals to give you
an idea:
