Subject: First Time Valve Adjustment
From: &quot;Simon Ramirez Jr.&quot; &lt;carapace_at_onebox_dot_com&gt;
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

One more hurdle cleared in the happy ownership of my 1970 Bus.  I did
my first valve adjustment and it was quite easy.  The archives again
proved invaluable to a rookie Bus Pilot that has to do his own maintenance.
 I read, re-read, and re-re-read the archive entry from Landon and Karen
Hogue(thanks, if you're still on the list), bought parts, and dug in.
 A couple of hours later (I milked it, it was the first time) I started
Speedy up, with nary a clatter.  Let's see how the adjustment holds up
for the next 3K!


Thanks,

Simon Ramirez Jr.
