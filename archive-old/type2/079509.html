&gt; Please when you get a chance - I would love to see the info!

&gt; I'm thinking stainless steel casings around OEM heat sinks and pipes
&gt; (properly coated with a paint to slow any rusting) and this would eliminate
&gt; any chance of exhaust fumes in the interior. When the OEM pipes and sinks
&gt; rust out (but shouldn't be fast with a proper anitfreeze) you just dig out
&gt; another set of rusted heater boxes, cut off the shell, move the watercooled
&gt; shells from your old pipes to your &quot;new&quot; pipes.
&gt;
&gt; Should be several years per set or more.
&gt;
&gt; But how to pump the water around without a bunch of pulleys....

ONe of my students showed me an electric water pump in a Summit Racing
catalog.  Pumps something like 30gal/min, which would be overkill in this
situation.  You might even get by with an electric fuel pump.  I'd mount
it in the cold side of the system.
