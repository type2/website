Subject: 73 westy

Hi folks new to list but not to VW's. My first was a 71 bus that i drove
across this great country in 85. Next on the list came a 71 Super
Beetle,followed ny a 70 Ghia. I'm now heading back to my roots and I'm
buying Arts 73 Westy in Oaklahoma!! The family and I are then heading off
to Florida and then eventually heading back to Seattle. What I would like
to do is help raise awareness to Melanoma skin cancer which i also have any
ideas on how to do this, and combine it with our cross country trip??
