Subject: Shifter adjustment issue

Hi Volks,

A friend of mine is in Dallas without 'Net access and reporting shifter
problems in his '82 Vanagon.  Doesn't seem to want to go into 1st, sometimes
grinds slightly.  I have tried to describe adjusting the shifter plate over
the phone, but am hoping someone is in the Dallas area who could give him a
call and possibly meet up to take a closer look at the situation.  His Name
is Jason Pettipiece, 512-947-3507.  I think he is planning to head back to
Austin tomorrow, so any help before the road trip back would be appreciated.
