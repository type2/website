Subject: How to attach the roof cabinet and roof panels ?
Date: Sat, 31 Oct 1998 10:44:38 +0100
Message-ID: &lt;01be04b3$13d473a0$9a09eec3_at_van-mullem&gt;

I bought a '65 westy interior for my '67 split.
I have a few questions :

1. Are the 3 roof bows attached in the gutter just above the windows ?
   If yes -&gt; My bows are to short !!!
   If no -&gt; how and where do I attache them ?

2. I've seen in a parts catalog for a '67 westy that I need 2 supports for
the roof
    panels and 1molding.
    Again : how and where do I attache them and what are the sizes of these
3 items
   (I don't have these 3 things, I will have to make them myself -&gt; What
kind of wood
   do I use for these ?)

3. Is the top cabinet attached to the gutters ?   There are some (4) iron
hooks
    screwed on the cabinet, but they are not wide enough to hang it in the
gutters.
    Again : how and where do I attache it ?
