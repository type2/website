Subject: Re: [T2] Automatic with type 1 motor

the flex drive of the auto-stickshift is not a fully
automatic transmission, it is a vacuum shifted clutch
with a hydraulic operated clutch arm. the  t-3 car has
a fully automatic transmission in it with a flex drive
and a torque converter in it.  The flex drive is the
same size og the t-4 flex drive, only the flywheel
connection is different, to put  the flex drive on the
t-1 engine you will need a flex drive flywheel bolt,
one with the center big enough for the hub of the
torque converter to fit into. Phil
