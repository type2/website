Hi gang.  This is No Quarter from the vintagvw and vintagebus listserves
here.  I've been on the vintagvw list since 1993 and can well remember the
several incarnations of the type2 list over the years including the
division of the lists to cater to the splitty, bay, and vanagon crowd.
One of the guys on the vintagebus list suggested I sub to this list and
I've done so with an alternate email addy.  My main one is
silent_at_beatricene_dot_com

The reason I've subbed is that I'm wanting to rebuild a T4 and do Joe
Cali's conversion on it so that I can run it in my 67 bus and possibly a
bug in the future.

I thought that for all the questions I have, this would be the place to
hang out and ask away.

Bare with me through all of this. :-)

For starters, I've built a 1776 T1 engine for my bus but I find that I
could really use more power.  I'm concerned about longevity and it's
getting to the point where I almost resent adjusting the valves.  I want
something powerful and reliable and a little easier to maintain so I've
decided to build a bone stock 2L T4 engine.  I already have new P/C's and
the pistons are dished.  Dunno what that means.

I'll stop there.  I'll ask more questions later.  Glad to be back with you
bay windowers again.

NQ
