Before anyone says 20/50 is the best thing since sliced bread....
If you look at a &quot;Engine Oil Viscosity Specification&quot; chart and compare temp 
ranges, you will see 20/50 craps out at 80º. There is one on page 5 of 
section 9 of the 68-79 Bentley. Also in bus owners manuals. Bob in Texas 
talked of driving in 110 degree temps. Here in Fresno, Calif., the summers 
usually have 30 to 40 days with temps 100-110. The temp range for 40 weight 
is 68 to over 100º [the chart stops at 40c/103f]. Even a Mercedes owners 
manual [85] says &quot;SAE 40 may be used if ambient temeratures constantly 
exceed +30ºC/+86ºF&quot;.
The operating range of 20/50 is 15F to 80F. This would be the range across 
the northern part of the U S, but Bob was talking about driving across the 
southwest.
