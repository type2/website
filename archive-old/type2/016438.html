Subject: Installing a stereo, without damaging the van.

I cant speak for the '78 but on my '72 westy there are 2 holes stamped
in the steel part of the door, about where your knee would touch the
door pannel.  Simply remove the door pannel, carefully find the center
for your speaker hole ( mine was so old and dirty it was almost a
templet, and cut the smallest hole possible.  It worked for me.  If
you're still not sure, just have a place like circuit city to install
it, it's usually pretty reasonable.  Also, ( it was about 7 years ago) I
remember that I ordered the speakers from Crutchfield. As part of their
catalog they gave speaker placement and size recommendations and I
believe instructions, (please don't hold me to this though, as I said
this was a long time ago)
