Subject: random parts i really want

Hey All,
my bus is currently in the shop getting sanded and painted so i'm in a state
of complete withdrawl(uncontrollable drooling, constant sobbing etc.--i'm
sure you have all experienced it at one point or another)
anyway, i figured that while she was gone would be a good time to get much
needed parts that i've been looking for for a while .  sooo, i'm looking for
the following parts which i haven't been able to find ANYWHERE, and believe
me, i've looked (though maybe not in the right places).
1. a steering wheel for a 78 bus--the rubber on mine is degrading and
literally comes off in my hand 
2. those little levers for the heating unit, one red and one blue
3. rubber step pads for the foot well thingy at the bottom of the door.
4. a glove box that isn't falling apart and that isn't 32 bucks.

Also, something i noticed that i wanted to check out with everybody.
Usually when i decellerate(sp.) i can hear a little bit of backfire from the
engine, almost like pop-corn but not just the average sound of a vw.  my
mechanic said he couldn't even hear it when he drove it, but i'm not sure i
trust him enough and i'm  really not  a mechanical person.  
BTW, i'm looking for a new mechanic in the Boston area--anybody out there
know of one?
i think that's it for now, thanks 
Jake V.
