Patrick and All;

We've had ancient vee-hickles of all persuasions insured for decades with
Reliance and Metropolitan.  

If one of the rigs is going to be hors de combat for an extended period
we simply drop it to a &quot;storage&quot; and/or &quot;out of service for repairs or
restoration&quot; status, retaining only fire and theft coverage at a very low
rate.  When the vehicle is again fit for service, we call the company and
restore full coverage.  There's never a problem, as this is normal
procedure for most companies.

I suspect your agent is the problem, not your insurance company.  Is she
an agent for a single company, or a broker writing business with several
companies?  A broker, by state law and regulation, is supposed to
represent and look after YOUR interests.  A company agent represents the
company's interests.

Regardless, if you are happy with your existing insurance company and
coverage you can contact the company directly about the bus you're
considering.  This often will get you the best premium due to multi-car
coverage, &quot;loyalty discounts&quot;, etc.  

If your agent doesn't like you contacting the company directly, it is
definitely time for a new broker or agent...
