Subject: 76 Westy Parts Bus, Cape Cod MA

Hello List

I was driving through Chatham MA today there was a  Green 76 Westy in a bone
yard parking lot. The bus is very complete with a full Westy camper package,
complete 2.0L motor. It is extremely rusty and has been sitting a while but it
is all there and they are eager to start parting it out cheap!!! I have an
address and phone # if you e-mail me off list I will be happy to give it to
you.

Happy Bussing, Jamie (75 Riviera\Westy Hybrid)
