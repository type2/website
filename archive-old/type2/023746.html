Hi,

&gt; In my experience the CDI &quot;black boxes&quot; are intolerant of the 
&gt; heat in a Type
&gt; 2's engine compartment.

 Heat? What heat?

&gt;   When they get overly warm the ignition system
&gt; starts to fail, missing and backfiring or simply ceasing to function.

 OK, taking this more seriously I can see that if it gets hot where 
you drive this might be an issue. For me this isn't a problem- living
where I do there always seems to be a plentiful supply of cool air 
for my engine bay.
 It is something that can be engineered out, however, so I think it
ought to have more to do with the quality of the product than any
fundamental unsuitability of the system. It's been said before that
when you move away from stock components you take on the burden of
ensuring the replacements are appropriate and that will be the case
here.
 
&gt; It's a real bear to troubleshoot.  Function usually returns 
&gt; to normal when
&gt; the black box cools down.  Of course, this generates a great deal of
&gt; frustration because when you stop to fiddle with the ignition 
&gt; system the CDI
&gt; box cools down and the fault disappears.

 FWIW the Tiger 581 has a conveniently reversible connector which
allows the electronics to be removed from the system. If you
suspect it may be causing a problem it can be isolated in seconds,
and hence identified or eliminated as the source of the problem.
 Naturally the cables and connectors themselves are potential
failure points, any addition of a component clearly introduces
another potential point-of-failure.

&gt; Been there, done that, sticking with a stock ignition system 
&gt; for its ease of
&gt; repair in the field.....

 Yup. Perfectly sensible point of view.

 As always, it's your bus, your time, your money, your call... :-)

Cheers,
	  W.
