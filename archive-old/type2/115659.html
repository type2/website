Subject: Re: Safety tape for rear bumper, GREAT IDEA

Wonderful idea Richard, did you get your tape at a body shop supply store?
Is there a web site?

Thanks, I really like this idea and want to put some on the bumper of my
Scamp that I pull behind my '76 westy.

&gt; I have an 80 inch long 1 inch wide 3M reflective strip on my bumper. I've seen
&gt; a noticeable change in the behviour of following drivers; they stay way back
&gt; from my bumper. The 3M technology can be seen clearly in the dark for hundreds
&gt; for feet assuming the manic behind you has his lights on.
