Subject: RE: [T2] truckers, buses, PLF

&gt;The main thing is that they are all OK, but a little sore. The worse part
&gt;is there is now 1 less highroof and 1 less container van, there used to be 4
&gt;known, now 3 and a scrape pile of another.

I saw the pics - couldn't some of the High Roof specific items be moved to 
another splitty or couldn't much of another splitty be grafted onto the 
high roof?

I've seen cars and trucks reconstructed from wrecks as bad or worse - all 
it takes is money!!! (Lot's of it!)
