Subject: Starting Problems?

Hello Again. Here's the latest.  My vanagon 2.0l FI is having some
trouble starting.  There are times when it starts with no problem at
all.  Other times I'm not so lucky.

Problem Explained:  If it does not start on first attempt it is very
difficult to start.  I let it rev for 5-10 seconds and it wont start.  I
wait 30 seconds and it try again.  If I am lucky it will catch and turn
right over.  If not I repeat the process.  Usually take 2-3 attempts. 
Now this occurs both on cold starts and warm starts.  Seems to be more
of a problem after a stall.  Normal running is fine with plenty of power
(brick power) and little to no hesitation.  Sounds like a FI problem to
me.  Which components should I examine (thermo switch, cold start valve
. . .)?  
Thanks again,
Jason
