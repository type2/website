Subject: RE: [T2] Bus Registered as Rec Vehicle

&gt; Insurance on a &quot;motor home&quot; is way more expensive


Not necessarily. In my case it was slightly cheaper, and covered such
attachments as awnings, etc.  However, to get it you had to have one
regular passenger vehicle on the policy, as the assumption was that the
&quot;motor home&quot; is not your daily driver.
