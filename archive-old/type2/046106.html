Hi John,

&gt; the problem is that fuel flow is NOT linear to air flow.

Right, as the rate of flow of the air through the carburetor increases,
the rate of flow of the fuel also increases, but at a much faster rate.
This is due to the fact that the density of the fuel does not change
while the density of the air does.  In a simple carb, the mixture would
be overly rich at WOT, and actually only correct at one position of the
throttle.  That is why carbs are equipped with some form of
compensation, compensating nozzles, air bleeds to maintain the air fuel
mixture at a constant rate.

fwiw,
