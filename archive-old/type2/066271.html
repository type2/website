&gt; &lt;snip&gt; My understanding is that you can make ethanol from just
&gt; about anything organic including animal by-products. Speaking as
&gt; a VW Bus freak, the prospect of running on grass and chicken
&gt; beaks has a certain declasse appeal to it. ;)

Since we're discussing alternative fuels and drive the
hippie-bus-cum-yuppie-mobile, I'll offer the following quote from
Hugh Downs.  Yes, that's right, the venerable ABC News Hugh
Downs.

     The reasons the pro-marijuana lobby wants marijuana
     legal have little do do with getting high, and a great
     deal to do with fighting oil giants like Saddam
     Hussein, Exxon and Iran.  The pro-marijuana groups
     claim that hemp is such a versitile raw material that
     its products not only complete with petroleum, but with
     coal, natural gas, nuclear energy, pharmaceutical,
     timber and textile companies.  It is estimated that
     methane and methanol production alone from hemp grown
     as bio-mass could replace 90% of the world's energy
     needs.  If they're right, this is not good news for oil
     interests, and could account for the continuation of
     marijuana prohibition.

So, Ken, your &quot;prospect of running on grass&quot; may not be so far
from the truth, just pretty far from legal.
