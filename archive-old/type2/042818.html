 does this sound
+AD4-like a 'Moonraker' to you?

Andrew, has it got the cabinets with brown laminate tops and mustard fronts,
and a sort of brown tartan tweed on the rear seats? If so then yes it sounds
like a Moonraker like mine.

It's a good layout I think with the rock and roll bed downstairs and sliding
panels to make up the upper bed.

There's a fair few of these mouldering away, and if you can get it back on
the road good luck.

I found one last week but it just has the regular non elevating VW roof.
It's got serious rot but the interior is great, so I'm hoping I can strike a
deal to take it for parts.
