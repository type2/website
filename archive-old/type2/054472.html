Subject: RE: Tool question

&gt; I can't see what 3 of these
&gt; tools would be used for -
&gt; an 8mm and 10mm allen wrench, and a 27mm combo wrench. Where
&gt; are these used on a
&gt; VW??

IIRC, the 8mm fits the standard oil drain plug in my '79 (replaced with
a VDO temperature sender).  The 10mm fits the bolts on the front seats
holding the back to the seat bottom.

Cheers,
Alistair
'79 Westy
