Subject: Reimo Catalogs for Sale
Message-ID: &lt;f24d737b.247ce514_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Just wanted to let everyone know that I have plenty of Reimo German Camping 
Accessory catalogs in stock.  These are available from my web pages.

The catalogs feature the Bus tents, and include a lot of generic items, but 
are geared toward Vanagons and EuroVans.

The catalogs have over 300 pages of cool color pics, but all the text is in 
German.

$10 ea. including postage.
