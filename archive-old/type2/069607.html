Hello all

Nat &amp; I are taking off tomorrow for our annual group camping event near
Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario.  I am signing off for a few days to avoid server
overload, so I'll catch up later.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those who replied to my
call for help in setting up my bus (&quot;running rough&quot;, &quot;carb expertise&quot;,
etc.).  I wish I could tell you what exactly I found was the problem, but
I'm not sure.  The other day, out of pure lack of other ideas I went
through a tune up procedure from start to finish.  I set valves to .006&quot;,
points to EXACTLY 50 degrees dwell angle, timing (idle) to 16 degrees BTDC
and 36 degrees max advance (using 009 dist. - as instructed by rebuilders)
spark gap to .025&quot;, adjusted carbs per the instructions from various
sources and checked all spark plug connectors (tightened two).  Josie is
now running very well and I have managed to put on about 900 miles.  I went
through the tune up procedure at 100 miles, 500 miles and will do tune up
probablt this weekend while in the Soo.  All is well so far, knock on wood.
The bus cruises at an easy 65 MPH and I'm surrently getting around 21/22
MPG using 92 octane fuel.


Thanks again for all the help.

Regards,
