I'll take over from my Dutch friend Benny:

	- the text entstörsatz means radio noise filter or screen

Correct sofar.

	0.47µf/100v means  0.47 microfarad per 100 volts.

Nearly right, it is a capacitor of  0.47 microfarad with a maximum working
voltage of 100 Volts.

What you have here is a radio interference surpressor, these normally
consist of just a few standard electronic parts (coil and capacitor)
available from any Radio Shack for a few dimes. Well, we know what they will
cost at the VW counter.

It's purpose is to filter the high frequencies (sparks from firing the
plugs) from the 12 volt supply to your radio so you can enjoy your medium
wave or 8 track without being able to tell the revs your engine makes by
listening to the wine coming from the speaker in the middle of the dash.
Well, for you youngsters that went on into FM and stereo things got more
complicated (there's only place for one speaker in the dash!) but basically
these filters are now built in everywhere they are needed.

Your parts will probably fit any type of older VW . I don't think their
worth exceeds the value of the cardboard box (if in mint condition!).
