Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Line Questions

It's more than just length I think. There are male-female thread differences also. The left rear hose has a male on one end and a female on the other while the other 3 have female threads at both ends. At least that is the way my 71 is set up. 
I would think if the longer female/female hose is used on the right rear, there might be a possibility of the line kinking and closing off. The correct one fits just right so why put incorrect ones on when the correct ones are available fairly inexpensively.

&gt;&gt; Length.
&gt;  
&gt;

Hmm... And it appears that my 281...B line is 340mm, and the others
are 270mm and 265mm.

Anybody tried the longer hose on the rears? Isuses with binding and/or
rubbing?
