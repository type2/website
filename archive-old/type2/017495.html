Subject: Battery Questions (recommendations needed!)
Message-ID: &lt;36FEEBAE.E67E2D28_at_columbus.rr_dot_com&gt;

My &quot;76 Westy is in dire need of batteries and after exploring the
subject I have a few questions maybe someone out there can answer.  When

I bought my bus from the previous owner it only had one battery and it
was on the left side.  I assumed this was to the battery to start the
engine and the other battery hookups on the right side were for the
auxiliary battery, which was not present. In my newbie ignorance, I
bought another  battery (the exact same type) and put it in on the right

side and everything has worked OK the past two years. (except for the
power converter)  Now after looking into replacing both batteries I have

found in my owners manual  that I will find the main battery on the
right hand side of the engine.  So now I am wondering if the previous
owner had it in the wrong place or if maybe he made some kind of
modification.  The power converter has never worked so I have just
shipped that out to be fixed.  Now I am wondering if my auxiliary
battery system needs rewired before I hook the refurbished power
converter and put in the batteries.
    I am also wondering what size, type, and brand of batteries are best

suited for a type II.  I looked through the type II tech library and the

archives and didn't find any specific recommendations.  I have found out

that I need a deep cycle battery for the auxiliary battery.  My bus is
loaded with stereo equipment so I am assuming I will need to take that
into account.  I store it all winter so I don't really have too many
cold starts except to run the engine every so often.  Any
recommendations or advise will be greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
Phillip Freund
