Subject: How much space over gas tank in 73?
Message-ID: &lt;370BDD04.59923CA5_at_musc_dot_edu&gt;

Hi volks,

I have a 73 kombi I am converting to a weekender.  I have the full width z bed
out of a 72 and need to drill holes in the back ledge to attach the back
supports of the bed.  The only problem is this is directly over the gas
tank!!!  How much room is there between the back ledge and the tank.  Is there
any chance of drilling into it?

PS  I will be at Everybus next weekend and will be leaving from
Charleston,S.C. if anyone wants to carabus.

Peace

Snoopy
