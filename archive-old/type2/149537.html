Subject: RE: [T2] Dwell Creep

&gt;First thing to check is the ignition. I check the dwell, ok around 42,
&gt;so I decide to regap my points. Get the dwell set around 48. Then I go
&gt;to do the timing - hmm, that's odd, I can't get a constant reading.
&gt;Timing seems to be jumping all over the place from 20-30deg BTDC.

What you describe here is what I've been experiencing this last week with my 
bus. I suspected a worn distrib. Although I had the dwell set perfectly as 
50 it's creeped up to 52 and stays consistant, so I can live with that. But 
the timing is all over the place. I started with static timing, 8 BTDC, but 
it seems sluggish, has flat spots when driving, and backfires rather badly 
at idle. Next tried with the strobe and set to 8 BTDC. Same thing really.

So I went and tired dynamic timing and the engine runs so much better, BUT 
when I look at the timing at idle it's about 20 BTDC. Makes me 
nervous.......It also runs a bit hot. Am I correct in suspecting my worn 
distrubutor?

(I spend a lot of time with the bus in the summer as I'm a teacher and stay 
at home summers. My wife says it's nice that I have a hobby.)
