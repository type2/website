Subject: Re: [T2] Oberg

Thanks! I was not really clear what it is.. I heard it was a pump, a filter,
and a cooler, but I haven't seen one.. want to check it out. I'm looking for
something that will work in tandem with the tower cooler, but working
directly off of the oil pump?..to keep the engine running cooler, but
without sacrificing lubrication or oil pressure. Any suggestions? Jan B

&gt; AFAIK, Oberg makes a filter, not a cooler.  A good cooler comes from
&gt; Harrison. A good source for all racecar oiling system parts is Earl's
&gt; Supply.
