That's a great thought, Andy, and in fact that was much like the original
problem. If I cranked for an eternity, it would start. But I rebuilt, and
when that didn't help, I replaced the carb, so the carb that's in there is
brand new, the float valve BETTER not be sticky!!

Also, the coil, points, plugs and wires are all brand new.
