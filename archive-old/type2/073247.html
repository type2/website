Subject: Re: gas tank sealing for lazy people

Please stop swishing gasoline around in there. Don't play with gas, it is
not a good tool, it is incredibly dangerous and unwholesome, it is not a
good solvent, it does not dissolve rust, it has no redeeming qualities at
all come to think of it. If not for our bovine idiocy we should be running
on propane or vegetable oil.

If it were me, and the tank was still in the bus, I would bung up the
outlet with some sort of cork or fid (see the Hoover CD for a delightful
essay on fids). Then I would slosh it out with detergent and water as best
I could by rocking the bus. Then I would drain it and immediately rinse
with water, then drain it and immediately rinse with about a gallon of
isopropyl alcohol (probably less than $10 at a local printers' supply),
which will dry it.

You could coat the inside with POR-15 or equivalent, but doing it with the
tank in by plugging the outlet would be an incredibly expensive project.
They sell that stuff by the ounce. I have never heard a report of POR-15
peeling off, I don't know what other coatings people put in gas tanks.

You could burn the rust out with acid, I would guess phosphoric or oxcalic
(sp?), if you had a mind to. This is probably the cheapest way to get the
inside clean, then it's probably good for another ten years. I expect the
detergent rinse would get you five years for a daily driver though.

&gt;Me again-

&gt;There is quite a bit of rust flakes in my tank, every time I swish some more
&gt;gas throgh more flakes come out.  I would like to seal it or whatever or at
&gt;least wash out the stuff thats in there.
&gt;
&gt;My problem is I am not mechanically inclide at all, and I'd be a huge pain
&gt;for me to try and take the tank out and I'd probably brake something doing
&gt;it.  I also don't think any mechanic around here is going to be able to do
&gt;it.  Is there any junk that I can just plug up the outlet (all the exit fuel
&gt;lines and exit little nossle and tank screen are off, so its just the exit
&gt;hole of the tank) anyway, any stuff I can just plug up the tank, pour it in,
&gt;and then drain it out?  I'm assuming most of the rust is probably near the
&gt;bottom anyway so I'm not so concerned with coating the entire inside.
&gt;
&gt;I have heard that some sealants can come off the walls over time and clog up
&gt;things, true?
