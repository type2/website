&gt;...that is the question. I set my 74 1800, dual carbs, stock, to 10* ATDC
static as suggested in Muir &amp; Bentley. Now it runs terribly! It had been
previously set to 4* BTDC and ran well, with the exception of the low idle
miasma I'm puzzling through.

Try setting it to 4 degrees BTDC and see how it runs.  My bus is happy with
that setting, at idle with the stock distributor and all hoses connected.

&gt;As I shot it with a timing light &amp; accelerated, the notch seems to advance
and retard well enough--up to 10* BTDC or so (I didn't check this in detail.) 

It should be advancing well past 30 degrees BTDC.

&gt;While driving, the engine coughs, sputters, bucks and pops

I'm not suprised!

&gt;Why do you suppose it runs better at BTDC than at ATDC? 

Because BTDC is more advanced, and you need to run a lot more advance than
you currently are.  Even with the factory dual-diaphragm distributor (you
do have that and not an 009, right?) 10 degrees ATDC is too far retarded
for your engine to run properly, and even 4 degrees ATDC is very conservative.
