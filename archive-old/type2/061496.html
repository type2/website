The lead in the fuel isn't the problem, but continuous exposure to the
aeromatics in the fuel isn't all that good for you.  It probably won't
kill you right away, but the long term effects are dicey.

I'd be more concerned about fuel loose anywhere in the vehicle.  In
the fuel tank compartment, fuel vapors make an effective bomb.  One
spark and you might be checking in with St. Peter (or the other guy!)
