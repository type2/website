Hi friends!!.

I arrived from Miami today morning.  I  stayed from last Wenesday at the
Airport Marriot Hotel attending at service  seminar given by Kia
Motors.   I´d lyke to give sircerely thanks to Andy Pechenik for his
help in giving me some advises on who to buy some VW parts from
(although unfortunrtly we didn´t meet).  I bough the air filter element,
the original 1700cc spark plug wires, the engine foam seal and some
other plastic stufs from Andres Imported Parts,  he has a great store.
Then I went to Florida foreing -much bigger store- and bought an Ignitor
&gt;from Pertronics.  Will star working on the van on Saturday.

Once again thanks and regards.
