Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for a hightop near Arizona

Hey Ray and all,

The hightop with the luggage rack is an Adventurewagen top and is the most
common, but you can't put a bed up top as stated.

I have been off of the list for a while and have since acquired a new daily
driver that I put a Riviera high top on. It is one of the biggest hightops
made and allows me to sleep up top (I did at Everybus). Jamie Auch also had
success with a Safare top on his early bay after cutting some of the roof
off.

On a side note I have also acquired a new domain for 72camper_dot_com. Both
sites are live now until I can get all the content on the new domain. The
new site is www.baywindowbus_dot_com and will have all that 72camper has and
more (eventually). For some pics of my new daily driver and the Riviera
hightop go here: http://www.baywindowbus_dot_com/sunshine.htm

If anyone else has some pics of their hightop I would love to add it to my
galleries. Also if you have a link to 72camper on your site I would
appreciate it if you could take a minute and change it to the new domain.

Rob &quot;Hot Dog&quot; Henley...hightop advocate!
