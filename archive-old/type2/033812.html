Hello all....

Have another problem with my '76 Westy, Helga.  Went to start her up tonight
and was greeted with, you guessed it....click...click.  Had lights, but it
would not turn over.  What could it be?  Is it the starter?  I was also
thinking I may have caused this problem.  Last week I had to replace the
positive battery cable.  Could a loose connection be the cause of this?  Let
me know what you think.  I always appreciate the help I get from the list.
There is NO WAY I could keep my baby running without the list.  I will stop
now.  I am starting to sound like I am sucking up.....
