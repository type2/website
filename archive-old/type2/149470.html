Subject: 009 distributer and 34 PICT carb

I believe I understand how people feel about the 009 distributor.  Ratwell's 
site leave no doubt on his feelings..

however, I saw this posting:

http://www.aircooledtech_dot_com/34pict3_modification/

Is there anything to it??  Is there still hope for the 009??

And what was he referring to as the difference between the 30 PICT and 34 
PICT??

Comments....
