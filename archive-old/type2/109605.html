Subject: Re: [T2] vacuum level

Were you asking me or was that a general question? I'm only at about
75-100ft above sea level so I guess its about right on. Since the level was
high, stayed steady and didnt fluctuate would that mean that I have no
leaks?

&gt; No one seems to remember what the reading is on a brand new factory fresh
engine. Who was talking about too high a reading being bad?
