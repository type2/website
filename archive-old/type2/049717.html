You could also try www.dormobile_dot_com for parts etc, although they have moved
to Land Rover conversions, they still advertise conversion kits. Or you
could try www.spacecraft-uk_dot_com for accessories etc. Not on the web, but
producing individual cabinets for T2 bays are 'Country Furniture Co.' on
01443-223288, sorry no web site.
