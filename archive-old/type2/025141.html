Yeah, I passed up a '69 Westy for $1500.00 about five years ago...it was a
beautiful vehicle...wished I would have gotten her...I kick myself
frequently. I also passed up a '67 splittie for the same price.

Thank You,

That's what I tell myself.  The bus I bought the day before I found the
ad for this one is a disaster, and the pretty '79 I paid way too much
for a few weeks later has had nothing but one problem after another. 
I've got to hit the road shortly for a few months elsewhere, and it's
taking its' toll on me.

It just hurts.  I know I'm whining.

Thanks for acknowledging my post.  Misery, company, all that.
