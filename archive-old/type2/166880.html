Subject: Starter / Flywheel mesh HELP PLEASE!?!?!

If you refer back to my previous problems, my starter didn't seem to be fully meshing with my flywheel. It's turning like crazy, making a machine gun sound, but not turning the flywheelWell, I pulled?the starter?to put the calipers to the starter and flywheel (flywheel is impossible to do that to).
?
I was measuring the length of the shaft (takes me back to being a teenager), and the depth of the bushing when I started looking at the teeth on the starter, there is some wear (after 10 or 12 times of trying to turn it over) on one edge of about half of the teeth on the starter. After sticking my head up in there a little farther...to look at the flywheel teeth, ?It looks like my starter's gear is WAY too coarse to mesh with the flywheel. How many teeth should my starter have? I have 9, the tops of the teeth form a 1&quot; diameter , so that makes them 40 degrees? I have taken photos of both flywheel and starter, with a penny as reference... If anyone is interested.

Long story short. Is there more than one version of starter for my 1972 German built type2? Did my local parts store's parts chooser steer me wrong? Or am I just imagining it and it's designed that way. I have been struggling with this for a while, and ANY help y'all can provide would be an act of heroism.

Sincerely,
Chris
