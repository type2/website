&gt; Hey, I'd send him one. I have a top of the line Fram with the gray colored
&gt; textured end that helps with removing it. Are you going to contact him then
&gt; Don?? I'll chip in.
&gt;

I can't find an email addy for him. There's an email addy at the bottom of
the home page, but if that's his or his designer's I dunno. Sending one
anyway...
