48 IDA's are way to big for any street car.  You can try it all you want,
but you will spend a fortune jetting and re-jetting....................

All the motors you mentioned from the VW rags are
hot-rods..................They are not daily drivers.  The people that own
these take them off a trailer at the shows and probably drag them.

Much better off to get carbs that are close to the size you need to start
with.  Those 48's look impressive, but few cars can use them, and even fewer
people have the patience, money and experience to tune them right.

&gt;
&gt;  Tim,
&gt; I got your email &amp; was quite interested to hear you say that IDAs are a 3
throat carb.
&gt; Yet through my fairly wide reading of magazines like Hot VW's, VW Trends &amp;
Total VW I've found a number of Cal Look bugs that apparently run IDA's &amp; 48
IDA's at that.
&gt; I'll refer to page 50 of the November 2000 edition of Hot VW's featuring a
blue 65 Type1 with a 1915cc engine &amp; twin 48 IDA's.
&gt; Or perhaps the 54 Oval featured on page 48 in this year's February edition
of Hot VW's running a 1835cc with twin 48 IDA's.
&gt; And perhaps you'd like to tell Frenchy Dehoux of all people that when he
built this car he was building a engine that wouldn't even run &amp; would
&quot;flood the plugs before you could get them to fire on initial startup&quot;.
&gt; You might also want to tell him that the 36mm venturis he's running are
way wrong as well.
&gt; Or perhaps take a look in the same edition at Geoff Hart's 10 second
2332cc equipped 59 Sunroof bug that runs bored our 52mm IDA's with 46mm
venturis.
&gt; This last one is maybe a bit much because it's practically a drag car, has
no back seat, spindle front wheels &amp; a full rollcage.
&gt; My point is that IDA's are alive &amp; well on VW's &amp; providing amazing
results.
&gt; Oh, &amp; your point on Marvel Mystery Oil.
&gt; In a tech article on rebuilding Weber &amp; Dellorto carbs sponsored by CB
Perfromance in again the same edition readers are advised to use either
Liquid Wrench or.......surprise, surprise....Marvel Mystery Oil &amp; the
technical staff actually used the Marvel product.
&gt; I'm sure your methods are excellent Tim &amp; your years of experience has
fine tuned the way you build &amp; maintain engines.
&gt; But it doesn't mean you have the right to be so condemning or patronising
just because you feel one of us has no idea about what we're talking aboutin
your superior wisdom.
&gt; There's more than one way to skin a cat.
&gt; I sent the previous email because I didn't know that much but knew enough
to think the question was worth asking.
&gt; My final question before I pull my head back into my shell is are IDA's
dual of triple throat?
&gt; Please enlighten me.
&gt; Cheers

is a dual throat. Even so, fabricating a manifold
&gt; to run a single IDA to both heads would require a big bunch of
&gt; skill/time/money. It would be an experiment, so if such experimentation is
&gt; of value to you, pursue it, and let us know your results.

&gt;
&gt; &gt;Tim,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;If you found the right manifold for it, couldn't you run the 48 IDA as a
&gt; &gt;single carb though?
&gt;
&gt; I know of no such animal. No engineer I know of in the world has thought
it
&gt; worthwhile to make up a three throat carb to two port head manifold for
the
&gt; IDA's. Sure, it could be done theoretically. With several thousand dollars
&gt; worth of skilled engineering and custom prototyping, you can do anything.
&gt; If it works well, you might even be able to demonstrate it and sell it.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Anyhow, there's plenty of Cal Look Beetles running a pair of these with
&gt; &gt;admittedly large engines.
&gt;
&gt; I'll bet those are IDF's, not IDA's. Very different kettle of fish.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Surely if you happened upon another one you could fit it to a Type4 style
&gt; &gt;engine?
&gt;
&gt; IDA's are 3 throat carbs. IDF's are dual throat. IDA's are for 6 cylinder
&gt; Porsches and V-12 Ferraris, though like I said, if you wanted to try to
&gt; engineer a manifold to adapt them to a two port head, experiment on,
&gt; McDuff, as long as your are funding this experiment.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;What does everyone think?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I'm not impugning your know-how or experience, Tim, but I like to see
some
&gt; &gt;original solutions.
&gt;
&gt; A pair of 48 IDA's would drown a T-IV motor unless you figured out how to
&gt; build it to well over 3 liters and ran it over 5000 rpm at all times. It
&gt; sure as hell would not be anything like a street drivable engine.
&gt;
&gt; Note that the venturie that would work well on a 2.0l IDF motor are like
&gt; 32mm tops. That would be 32mmX4 for something that fits the application.
&gt; Now compare 48X6 to feed the same motor. Get the idea??? You would flood
&gt; the plugs before you could get them to fire on initial startup even if you
&gt; spent gross amounts of time/money/skill to develop/fabricate the manifolds
&gt; from scratch.
