Subject: Re: Battery Pan rust

Perhaps there's a reason, but why don't VW owners just add a rubber 
battery tray? 

The rust is caused by acid collecting on the top of the battery. As 
water is added, it finds its way to the bottom, where it eventually 
finds its way under the paint and starts corrosion, with the help of 
condensation.  The best way to tackle corrosion is to avoid it in 
the first place. Battery trays cost under $10, and are good for many 
years. 

BTW, the rubber tray, I'm told, also helps the battery keep its charge 
when sitting.

the past.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Any suggestions?

&gt; I have pretty much the same problem - if I were you, I'd wire brush/wool
