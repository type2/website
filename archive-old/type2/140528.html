Subject: Re: [T2] Multimeter fried?

Why do the British drink warm beer?  Lucas makes their refrigerator compressors!  KR
and
Lucas electric systems more likely to leak smoke
than, say. Bosch or Delco? Aha! Lucas is British.

I am not sure why everyone picks on Lucas. They do make something
that does not suck........       Vacuum cleaners.

Seriously, though. On newer Mercedes, 96 and up, Lucas makes some
of the brakes boosters and the brake calipers When the early E class [210 body]  had a high percentage of 
squeaky brake pedals when applying the brakes, it was a bad brake booster. It happened with Ate and Girling 
boosters, but never with Lucas boosters. I have not had to replace any Lucas brake part.
[you can have 3 identical E320's next to each other, and not all the brake parts suppliers match!]
