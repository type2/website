&gt; A friend of mine is forced by circumstances and lack of time to get his Van

Van

&gt; convert a van to a pickup?  Say, a double cab?

I saw a coupla guys do that to a Toyota two door a few years ago...
All they used was a Sawzall and a sheet of plywood and some plex-
iglass but I'm guessing that's not what you had in mind... ;-(
