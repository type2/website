Subject: sand seal and idle


Earlier this year, I bought a complete engine from someone who had 
pulled it from a Baja. It was a 1641 DP with 34PICT-3 .

It wouldn't idle when I received it.

After a complete top-end rebuild, it still wouldn't idle. Swapped 
carbs and checked thoroughly for vacuum leaks.  No luck.


I tore the engine apart, split the case, and found the following:

1. a sand seal / pulley: I had heard of these, but had not seen one. 
True to its name, it is constructed to keep even air from entering 
the case around the rear end of the crankshaft.

2.  a cam with 0.377 lift, instead of the stock 0.280 value.

My question is: Could either of these be the cause of my lack of 
idle? I had heard that the engine is intended to breath through the 
opening that was completely sealed in my engine.

Thanks, Jack
