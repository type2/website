Subject: Re: [T2] 79 Bus Windshield Washer

It uses air pressure just like a bug. The tank and hose fitting is at the
passenger side kick panel.
Here is page 61 of the 78 owners manual [same for your 79]:

pg


&gt; I'm waiting for my Bentley to arrive and wondered if anyone can give me
&gt; a description of how the windshield washer is pumped and plumbed on this
&gt; bus. All my previous VWs used air pressure, but this one doesn't seem to
&gt; have a valve. Is the fluid pumped electrically? When I pull the arm I
&gt; hear no noise and no fluid is pumped.
