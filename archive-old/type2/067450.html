&gt; Well,
&gt; Just when I get my sink working well, I go and break the LED panel.
&gt; Shoot.  How, you may wonder, did I accomplish this amazing feat?
&gt; Simple, I say.  The switch for the panel was very loose, so I removed
&gt; the coverplate to investigate.  When you do that, you're faced with a
&gt; printed circuit board with LEDs and ICs on it, among other things.
&gt; Well, the switch was still loose and the cause was not readily apparent
&gt; from there, so I pulled the assembly out a little farther, noticing that
&gt; the circuit board is encased in a cheap plastic bin.  Behind this bin
&gt; all the wires come out, so you remove the little wire collar there and
&gt; you can pull the circuit board out of the plastic bin to see what's
&gt; going on behind the board.  While there, i found a cold solder on the
&gt; switch, which is the cause of its wiggling.  
&gt; 
&gt; Well, not having a soldering iron, I put it back together but now when I
&gt; flip the switch, no LEDs.  Hmmmm.  Used to be that you would flip the
&gt; switch and the LEDs would come on but as soon as you let go of the
&gt; switch, they'd go off.  You know, typical cold solder behavior.  The
&gt; jiggle factor.  Well, it was shot before and it's really shot now, tho I
&gt; don't know if my poking and prying had anything to do with its other
&gt; than speeding the disconnection of the switch from the board (well, it's
&gt; still in there and still loose, but I figure I &quot;helped&quot; it some).  
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, seeing as how my sink pump is controlled by the LED panel (yes
&gt; it is too -- Haynes even backs me up on this), and now my LED panel
&gt; doesn't turn on, neither does my sink.  
&gt; 
&gt; So, what I want to ask is if it's worth getting another one of these
&gt; panels or trying to have it repaired (it's simple, but it looks like one
&gt; of those things VW would charge $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ for) or if I
&gt; should just wire the pump up to the hot wire directly so the pump is
&gt; always available.  I think solution B is better (or at least cheaper)
&gt; and will eliminate a lot of goofiness as well.  If this could be
&gt; repaired, where would I take it?  Who does soldering nowadays?  
&gt; 
&gt; The only useful purpose this panel seems to serve (other than
&gt; controlling the water pump) is to indicate battery condition and water
&gt; level.  I guess neither of those functions is of dire importance but it
&gt; would be nice to have them.  So what do you listies think about the
&gt; possibility of repair?  I'm sure I'm not the only one out there who has
&gt; had problems with this panel.  
&gt; 
&gt; Despite my propensity for breaking things, I'm still really enjoying
&gt; this camper :)
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt; Sean
