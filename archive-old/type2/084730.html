1.8 should fit, 1.7 would need to be opened up, any machine shop can do it.

DO NOT mix and match heads on your engine.  If the combustion chamber 
shape, combustion chamber volume and valve sizes are not the same, you are 
setting yourself up for big trouble down the road.  If you do not repair 
the head you have, be prepared to swap out both heads for another matched 
set.  VW cylinder heads are not Legos (tm) &lt;-- Don't sue me please
