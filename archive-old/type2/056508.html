Dear List,  this is Tom and the '79 westy that was running hot. I won't 
even tell you all how hot she ran across Kansas last Friday.  I had to 
pull over several times as the oil temp. needle creeped to the end of 
the scale. Mind you I have a dipstick sensor for my VDO oil temp, which 
supposedly reads 20'-30' hotter than the sump plate sensors.  Well 
anyway I decided to drive exclusively at night to avoid these 
astronomical oil temps.  I will mention that the cylinder head temp 
gauge was within the same range as on cooler days...
	SO to get to the point, I took her in to a mechanic here in Fort 
Collins CO,  I am getting ready to go further west and felt the great 
need to find the cause of these higher than usual temps.  I told him 
that I suspected a vaccum leak, possibly leaning my mix.  So he replaced 
a suspect manifold hose, decel hose and tightened my manifold to spec. 
The RPM was still eratic and idle was unwilling to go higher than 800.  
At this point he disconnected the 02 sensor, all of a sudden the idle 
smoothed out and increased. Problem solved? '79 Cali is the only type 2 
with an 02 sensor, so not many on the list would have suspected this to 
be a factor.  We replaced the sensor, readjusted the idle, then got the 
C0 machine out and adjusted the CO to spec. I took her out for a 3 hour 
drive in the middle of the day, and lo and behold no more high temps!
Apparentley the 02 sensor was malfunctioning and sending an incorrect 
signal to the FI brain, which controls the air/fuel mix.  Also the 
slight vaccum leaks we found probably contributed to the leaness too.
I am on the road, my friend is answering my email,but is having trouble 
getting the program open!
