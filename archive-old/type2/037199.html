Subject: fuel sender wire info request

An embarrassing confession:  After pulling the motor, refurbing the tank,
cleaning everything up nice and clean, new battery trays, new exhaust,
etc...  I managed to forget to hook up the sending wire (funny, even got the
ground on correctly, I remember doing it) to the new fuel sender in the
tank.  I figured I'd just tough it out without a gauge until the next engine
pull, but who know's when that will be?  It's lazy, but if anyone has a
minimally invasive method (with dimensions) of getting a wire on the sender,
I guess I'd be willing to drill the hole in from either side.  Sheesh.
Thanks.
