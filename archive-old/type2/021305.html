Subject: H. Steve update

I got an e-mail from Steve this morning. He's supposed to be heading out
of Seattle today (Wednesday) and moseying down the west coast. He won't
be here (Los Angeles) until some time next week, so no Sunday bbq.
Hopefully the following Saturday (6/23) we could get something together?
He says he'll definitely be here by then. Anybody interested, p-mail me.

Nikki
