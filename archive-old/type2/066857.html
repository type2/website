&gt;My next question is about the tank. My bus is a non westy and I
&gt;do not have a tank. Do you have any idea of the additional cost involved
&gt;in this? Is there any way that you can get a firm price on cost of
&gt;the heaters ( say within $50) before ordering?

        I have these same questions as my '82 diesel is a non westy (home
butcher/conversion camper).  I am going to call some junkyards this weekend
to see about how a westy tank will run me (I need to check on a set of
wheels for my winter tires anyways).

        I don't wasnt to comitt myself untill I find out if I can get a
propane tank.
