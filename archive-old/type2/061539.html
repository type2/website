Well it finally happened. I just drove home in third gear - it's been
coming for a while. I've used a bungee cord to hold it in gear for the last
three months, but today it absolutely refused to stay in gear. Therefore
I'm in the market for a good used transaxle. I was quoted a ridiculously
high price from an Austin shop, about five hundred too high, based on my
last transaxle purchase four years ago. I'm located south of Austin, Texas.
If anyone in the area has a tranny they would like to sell for a fair
price, let me know. BTW, it's a '71 loaf.

Thanks in advance and Merry Christmas,
