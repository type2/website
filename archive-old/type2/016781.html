Joe,

Here's how ASI dealt with it in '77. (And how mine's set up.)

Coleman forced air furnace located in the bottom of the closet behind the
driver.  Vents through the wall under the 110v hook-up.  Aux battery in the
engine compartment on the right side. 

As far as what a battery puts out,  it's primarily hydrogen and oxygen.  Not
really a good combination to have in the passenger compartment, (tends to be a
bit on the flammable side...) though Vanagons do it with impunity. I've seen
pics of the aux battery located in a marine battery box under the driver's
side rear seat.  The most important thing would be to make sure that it's
securely fastened down.
