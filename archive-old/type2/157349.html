Subject: Re: [T2] Craftsman tools

Hi Joe.  Good idea (for a hoosier, $%#)!  But I can't find a  way to sign up on their website.  'Craftsman Club' turns up  nothing in a search.  But then maybe it's only for hoosiers. And  where the heck is Hope?  There's no Hope for Hoosiers!   :)  Nah, I've got a lot of family up there.  With Southern  accents.  Drives the locals crazy. My grandfather moved to South  Bend when WWII started.  Took half of the family with him.   Our family always stuck with the Union anyhow.   Never were for  secession and some went North and joined up.  That county (Wayne,  TN) still votes Republican, I'm proud to say.  Cheers...KR

membership card, along with a flyer about once a month with &quot;specials&quot; only available to members. 


The flyer is usually about 20 pages of different tools (hand tools, socket sets, pretty much a
random assortment of anything in the tool department) that are offered to club members at some
discount level, anywhere from 10% to 50%.

It's not a bad deal, especially since it's free.  I'm sure you'll be able to find at least one
thing you can't live without each month.
