Subject: Re: New Ga emission tests

whoa, this is bad.  i have enjoyed the completely indifferent nature of
georgia law towards emission tests for too long, i guess.

luckily my '72 westy will be exempt.  as someone said earlier, the smog
stuff is 'far from being installed'.

my '76 triumph, however, may have to bite the bullet and return to its
slower, smog pump crippled state.  but i bet thomas county is not one of
the ones slated to test cars.  small towns are good for keeping
clunkers--i bet i could drive around for a week with no bumpers or
lights of any kind and not be pulled over.  i could probably even drive
a formula one car around; wouldn't _that_ be fun!  ;)
