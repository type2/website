Subject: Re: Sigh... No More Vanagon

After many many years of carb fueled vehicles and a diesel Vanagon, about 7
years ago I bought a used FI car.  It took a while to learn enough to
basically understand how it (at least theoretically) was supposed to work,
what and where the sensors were and how they input to the computer and what
they were there for and after a number of stops, starts, tows, and repairs, it
settled down to be a pretty good starting and  running machine better than any
carb fueled machine I ever had.

My general observation on FI vs. carbs. is that,  properly running, FI beats
carbs all around on starting, drivability (especiall cold and during warm up),
fuel economy,  and retaining emissions requirements.  That said -  when FI is
&quot;sick&quot; life is a LOT tougher for the DIYer !!  You need the technical info,
some test equipment, and an understanding of how the system is set up and what
the various signals do.  The issue is probably one of complexity and
reliability.   In my experience, Carbs tend to be simpler and have fewer ways
to fail, but the price is that they can't meter the fuel as accurately or
tailor it as precisely to provide the optimum mixture at any given instant and
running condition.  FI, on the other hand is much more sophisticated and can
better give the exact best mixture at any given time -- except have greater
complexity and more parts, so there are more things to fail or go out of
tolerance.

In the end, bottom line, in my book I'll go with the FI.
