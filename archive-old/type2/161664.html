Subject: Re: [T2] steering wheel/column transplant - done!

Taking Tony's words to heart I went out and turned the key part way,
lights worked, window wipers worked, bright lights worked, all
the dash lights came on like they should.
Turned it over and presto.
It worked and started up.
I'm going to like this better.

So, it can be done!

James



 &gt; Well I installed it!
 &gt; 78 Steering column/wheel into my 74 westie
 &gt; Im afraid to start it up.
 &gt; It might blow up.

Doubt it...The '78 wheel doesn't have an air bag... ;-)
