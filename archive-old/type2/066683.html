Subject: &quot;fan motor&quot; location, 78

Alright, here's a silly question.  In Bentley, schematic wiring
diagram (J) for 77-78 buses, there is an item V2, which is labeled
&quot;fan motor&quot;.  What is it?  It is NOT the heater blower motor (item
V4), and the schematic actually shows it as *TWO* fan motors.  Where
are these fans, and what is their purpose?

I tried cross-referencing schematic (K) for the 79 bus, but it's laid
out differently, so it's not a straightforward comparison.  In any
case, I didn't even find a pair of motors wired through a single
switch on the 79.  But I did see a thing labeled &quot;fresh air vent fan&quot;.
Is that the same thing?  Is it under the dash?  Is it turned on by the
fresh air control lever?  I never knew there was a fan associated with
the fresh air system...

Paul Wies suggested my mystery fan is the blower fan for the gas
heater, but I'm not convinced.  I didn't notice any of the other
gas-heater-electrical-paraphenalia on the schematic.


Details, details, details... or as Boeing's president once said [my
paraphrase], &quot;The Boeing 747 is actually just 6 million parts, flying
in close formation.&quot;
