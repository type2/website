Subject: swamp coolers

For those of you who where inquiring about swamp coolers last week, you 
might want to check out Hot VWs this month. I didn't pick it up, but I 
did notice an interesting beetle. It was called Texas Trekker (or 
something like that). Of special note was the large tube hanging out the 
window of this rig.

For those of us old enough to remember, back in the 50s and 60s several 
companies produced &quot;air conditioners&quot;... which were sold out of the back 
of Popular Mechanics. The basic principal was similar to what was later 
known as a swamp (or evaporative) cooler.

Basicially, it was a large diameter tube (12 to 16&quot; in diameter?), open 
at the front end. On the side of the tube, a mount was provided. The 
mount was clamped in a window opening. At traveling speed, air is rammed 
into the opening of the tube, where it passed through a sponge, and 
would exit into the car. It held a couple quarts of water, which could 
be refilled from inside the car. 

Swamp coolers, in very dry climates, can drop the temp of a house. I 
doubt this system worked with any efficientcy, though... especially 
since no provision was made to seal off the other window openings.
