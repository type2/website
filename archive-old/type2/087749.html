Subject: Re: [T2] 1700 valve adjustment

[...]

The engine will start and run, correct?

If yes, then here is an easier way to adjust the valves.
Get a remote starter button. Connect it to the starter solenoid post where the
battery cable connects and to the little spade connecter on the soleniod.
Press the button and the engine should spin.
Remove both valve covers.
Watch any pair of rocker arms.
Press button.
When the exhaust valve JUST starts to open, STOP.
[If you go too far, just keep going and look again]
Adjust that cylinders intake valve.
Rotate the engine with the button.
The exhaust will open and close, then the intake will open and close.
JUST as the intake closes, STOP.
Adjust that cylinders exhaust.
Go to next cylinder.
Same procedure:
Exhaust just starts to move, adjust intake.
Intake just closes, adjust exhaust.
No need to go up and down and make a bigger job out of it.

&gt; Ok so im here really to admit that i am not mechanically gifted. But here is
&gt; the situation. I have a 72 westy with a 1700 pancake in it. Following muirs
&gt; procedures I have tried to adjust the valves but it doesnt make sense. I
&gt; dont have and marks on my crankshaft pulley and when i turn my alternator
&gt; with a wrench my crankshaft does NOt turn. I have tried to tighted it up but
&gt; it still does not good. The Belt is not too loose (about 1\2 inch
&gt; deflection)(I think that muir said something around that number). That is
&gt; also about as tight as i can get the belt. I am thinking that it might be
&gt; time for a new belt. Am i right?? And then when i do get the belt could
&gt; someone tell me if i have it right? I turn the alternator and watch the
&gt; rotor and when it gets to the little mark on the distributor then Its at the
&gt; firing position for #1 right?? Then i can just go 180* to do the next valve
&gt; and so on. Sorry if the question is too lenghty or if you guys are laughing
&gt; because you all think that this is such an easy thing but i just want to
&gt; figure it out and know how to do it myself so i dont have to depend on
&gt; someone else to take care of MY car. Thanks again
