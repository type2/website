Subject: [T2] Dreaded Squeak, inspection results

after inspection i noticed that the pad is rubbing the disc every half
turn.
it does stop when i brake. there is no roar
like described, so, it shouldn't be the bearing, but i am having it
checked out by a trusted VW mechanic on monday, so we'll see what
happens. any advice on how i can seperate the pad, and save some money
would be greatly appreciated.
thanx for the responses-
