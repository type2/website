&gt; I'd like to hear from some of you who have switched from fi to carbs

&gt; that way when it is tuned perfectly and this seems to be pretty 
&gt; difficult to achieve w/o a lot of expensive equipment.  My

Are you kidding?!!  :-)

The Bosch L-Jet FI is pretty easy to work on.  All you need is the 
manual, a VOM, and a test light... well, I guess you need an exhaust 
gas analyzer for setting the mixture accurately, but you need that for 
carbs, too.  Any decent shop can do the exhaust gas test for you.

Seriously, you would probably need dual carbs on the 2.0L engine, and 
that clutters up the engine compartment, and then you have to deal with 
synchronizing them, etc.

Regarding parts... you need carbs and manifolds, obviously... plus 
linkage.  Plus, you need a different fuel pump suitable for carbs (eh, 
maybe the FI pump could be used... but it's a high-pressure pump).

I love the L-Jet FI.  I enthusiastically recommend keeping it.
