Subject: hardware for stock muffler install

hello list.

recently a friend gave me a stock muffler setup. however, it is missing
the gaskets &amp; nuts to mount it.

instead of taking this big item into the hardware store with
me, can someone tell me what size nuts to buy for it?

to elminate confusion, a picture if the item i have is here:
http://www.busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=071251053EKS

also, where is the easiest place to obtain the gaskets &amp; what
kind of goop (if any) should i use when installing?

TIA,

Joel Wilson
