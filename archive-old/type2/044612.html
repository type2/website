Yes, I've had this problem since day one.

&gt; &gt; The transmission drives fairly well, engaging a little heavily but
&gt; &gt; driving just fine, for the first 15 minutes of operation.  After that it
&gt; &gt; begins to engage very heavily, and slowing down to a halt or any slow
&gt; &gt; speed maneuvering becomes a juggling act, driving with both feet and
&gt; &gt; three hands.  The drag from the transmission appears to be enough to
&gt; &gt; stall the engine, which would normally tick over just fine.
&gt; 
&gt; ?????  the 73 auto tranny has a vacuum shifter, and it can be adjusted,
&gt; there are complete instructions in how to do this adjustment in Bentley
&gt; but I would check everything else first

Does this adjustment change the shift points or change the ``drag'' in
the torque converter at standstill?  The hardest, worst thump is when I
shift into reverse from neutral or park, at a standstill.  It's enough
to rattle the cooker grill.  I'm pretty happy with the shifting during
driving, though it seems to me to shift down quite late.

&gt; take the four bolts off the sump pan (drain ATF first)  on the under side

If the sump pan is where the dipstick tube mates into, I have twice as
many bolts as that.  The only other plate I can see that drops off has a
bow in it, presumably to accomodate some longitudinally mounted rotating
thingummy.

&gt; there is a round plate with a &quot;tail&quot; off to one side, it is held on by two
&gt; screws, remove this plate, it is the filter, and clean well, replace and
&gt; clean sump pan.  replace the ATF and see if this helps

I did a partial change a week or so ago -- I couldn't find a drain plug
as mentioned in the Haynes Book of Lies (I presume my trans isn't old
enough) and I didn't have a replacement gasket to drop the pan, so I
pulled the dipstick tube and drained off about 3l of ATF, then replaced
it with nice clean stuff.  The old fluid was clean and smelled good.

&gt; sounds like you ATF pump is starving, also if the ATF pump fails this is
&gt; also a symptom, fixing it is next to impossible.

Joy!

After replacing the HT leads and plugs, and setting the tappets, the
engine now fires cleanly on all four cylinders.  Consequently it seems
to have enough torque to stay alive the whole time, though tickover is
set high to achieve this.  I still need to get this sorted before it
kills my CVs, engine and tranny.

I'll get the Bentley and a gasket set and do a full clean and and change
on the ATF.

Cheers,

Chris.
