Subject: Oh where oh where can my vacuum leak be



&gt;
&gt; As always there is just one last little problem.  I hear this noise and I
&gt; can't decide if it's a vacuum leak or not.  I replaced all the hoses when
I
&gt; installed the engine and I've jiggled everything I can get my hands on but
&gt; it just makes the same noise, like a tire with a leak in
it.....shissssssssss.
&gt;

Same thing drove me crazy on my 77.
Finally came to the conclusion that there were no leaks anywhere. The plenum
is made of very thin sheet metal and the noise is the sound of air moving
thru the plenum.
