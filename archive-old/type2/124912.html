Subject: RE: CHT sender follow-up

This would also explain why the CHT gauge looks different than the other VDO
cockpit gauges ... How much is the non-VDO gauge? If they have a 100% mark
up on the sender, the gauges may be equally cheap.

CHT sender follow-up
	63475 by: Chris Slaymaker

The sender (as well as the gauge) is probably made by the same company 
that makes some (or all) of the VDO gauges.  The price, however, is 
half of what VDO asks for their sender (go figure).
