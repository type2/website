Subject: Re: Re; Exhaust Ananyzer

Hi,

I checked the site and the announcement that the domain has just been sold
indicates that the former owner no longer has the domain name. Of course the
ISP sold some ad links to other automotive related firms knowing that the
previous owner was automotive related.

The gastester vendor has moved to:

http://www.aep.bigstep_dot_com/

The gastester info page is:

http://www.aep.bigstep_dot_com/digital1.htm

There are lots of links on this page for info on the product.

Price is up to $169, but check ebay. He often lists for less there.

John

&gt; I tried the website you listed and could not find this product.  Do you
&gt; have a more specific URL?  Also, can you offer an opinion of this
&gt; exhaust analyzer?  Have you used this exhaust analyzer?  How well did
&gt; it work?  Are you happy with it?  Do you feel like it gave you accurate
&gt; results?  etc.

&gt; $125 is inexpensive enough that I might spring for it.  It would cost
&gt; me nearly that much to take it to a shop and have an analysis done.
