Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Identification and Bucking problem help. . .

BJ Clark said:

I bought this '76 camper a few months ago and it's now a primary form of
transportation for me (kind of suddenly).
I don't think it came with the original engine, but I could be wrong. I
bought it from a bit of a shady mechanic who had it just sitting around and
had to get rid of it cause he had to move shop.
It didn't have any carbs so I had some on another bus with a seized engine
(a '72 transporter) and we put those on.
It has the serial number #GD013347 on the engine just infront of the
distributor.
I'm new to Type 2's (but have 2 and I've owned 3 bugs) and I'm trying to
figure out what kind of distributor I have so I can buy a tune up kit from
Bus Depot. Any easy way's to tell?

The only problem I'm having is that the bus runs fine once I have it warmed up, although it sometimes idle's
too fast, but when it's cold it will barely run. At low RPM's (in any gear when cold) it will buck very hard
and barely runs. It will die very easily. I've seemed to notice that if I have the clutch in and rev the
engine, then start to accellerate it will not buck hard or at all and once I've driven 1/2 a mile or so it's
running pretty
good.
The breaks seem to work great even when cold so my novice logic is that it's not a vacuum problem, however
I've never delt with type 2's so I could be way off.
I'm going to try to replace the points and spark plugs as soon as I can get
some new ones, but other than changing the oil, I've done no troubleshooting (too busy with my senior year of
college).
It did have a new starter and new battery when I got it.

 Please let me know if you can help idetify the engine or distributor or if
you have any idea's about the bucking issue.

GD is the correct engine for a 76-77 USA bus.
BUT if it is a USA bus, it should have fuel injection.

Where do you live?
Where did the bus come from, country wise..... we all know it originally came from Germany :)

When you say the engine number came from 'on the engine just infront of the distributor', this tells me you
are reading off the fan housing to the right of the ignition coil. WRONG place to read the correct engine
number. Fan housings get swapped all the time. The real engine number is stamped in the case, between the fan
housing and the square oil breather.

But keep in mind, all the engine number denotes is the identification of that case when it left the factory 30
years ago. What is in it now is anyones guess, without disassembly and inspection.

1976 is a strange year as far as the distributor goes. Up to build date 12/31/75 and vin # 2x6 2077 583, the
engine ignition and FI were essentially 1975 components. From build date 01/01/76 and vin # 2x6 2077 584, the
components are the same as 1977.

You will need identify your distributor by removing it and looking at the VW and Bosch numbers stamped in the
body.
