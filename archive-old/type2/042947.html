Ok.. I think I'm getting it.. kinda.. 

What's the difference between electronic ignition and CDI?

Here's what I think I'm gonna be looking for:

1.  Some kind of system that would replace the points.  I like the
magnetic pickup idea much better than the mechanical points.
2.  I guess a new coil, too?  Do I need to change the coil?  (is this
the CDI part?)

Any recommendations on brands that you've all used would be great!

Thanks,
Mike

&gt; &gt; I think I'm starting to like CDI.  Is this what the 80 vanagons use
&gt; &gt; because I was checking out my dad's and I noticed it didn't have points.
&gt; 
&gt; No, 79 Cal buses and 80-83.5 Cal vanagons have electronic ignition. It is
&gt; not Capacitive Discharge.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Increased milage, is this true?  If so, it's another thing that I'd like
&gt; &gt; to add to my list of items to purchase!
&gt; 
&gt; The Cal electronic ignition will give you better efficiency of the ignition
&gt; system. The coil output will always be at maximum. With new, clean points
&gt; coil output will be high but degrades as the points get dirty. Secondary
&gt; coil output is relative to primary voltage. The Cal system has no parts to
&gt; wear because nothing touches. Dwell and timing never changes. As the rubbing
&gt; block on points wear, dwell increase and timing retards.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyone have recommendations as to what kind of system would work well on
&gt; &gt; my 76 2000FI?  Does bosch make a system that is better or do the
&gt; &gt; aftermarket ones work as well?
&gt; 
&gt; The Cal system is a drop-in replacement if you get all the parts :
&gt; distributor, coil, module w/heatsink, and harness.
&gt; I may have enough pieces around to make 2 sets... :)
&gt; 
&gt; I am not familiar with the Tiger unit but if it is like the early 70's
&gt; Mercedes system that used points.....we had lots of problems until MB came
&gt; out with totally electronic distributors. The CD unit used very low voltage
&gt; across the points. It was not enough to burn off residue and keep the points
&gt; clean. We had to drill a vent hole in the side of the dist. cap to make the
&gt; points last. The oil fumes in the crankcase would go up the dist. shaft and
&gt; coat the points, since the cap was the highest point. Drilling a hole
&gt; allowed the fumes to vent, instead of lingering.
