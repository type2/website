&gt; &gt;aside from buying one
&gt; 
&gt; Y'know, I'd answer as Bob and Dave did (and their suggestions are
&gt; certainly valid!), but I can hear the followup post coming all the way
&gt; back in time from Monday... &quot;Does anyone have a single 1.7/1.8/2.0 piston

I agree with Steve here, I used the hose clamp once in an emergency when
the ring compressor was on loan
