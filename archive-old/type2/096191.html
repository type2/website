&gt; &quot;Temp sensor II is screwed into the front of the left-hand cylinder head,

ah

&gt; Unless you have a 75 1800 head, you will NOT have a sensor in that position on
&gt; the head. That is why you see nothing under it.

then what do you plug that hole with,  is it in all tin or do I happen to
have a 75 1800 piece of tin????
