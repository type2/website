Subject: Found RHD Devon camper

There has been a beat up old baywindow bus sitting in a filling station
parking lot next to where I work for a couple of weeks now.  I finally
stopped by today to take a peek.  BIG suprise!

&gt;From the outside it looked normal, except for this bizarre looking poptop
that doesn't go all the way to the front of the bus.  I didn't notice right
away that there was a sliding door on the left side of the bus.  I peeked
in and saw the steering wheel on the right.  At first I thought someone had
converted it to RHD because the dash was kinda torn apart, but when I
noticed the sliding door and the Devon decal on the dashboard, I decided it
must be an import.

This poor bus was thrashed!  Plenty of rust under the windshield, bondo
cracking and falling off, over an inch thick in places, interior torn up
(looked like just a bunch of camping style bench seats inside).  No front
bumper.  I think it was a '71 because it had disc brakes but old style
lenses and rear bumper.  Engine was a type 1.  Non-walkthrough.  Had a cot
up top.  So that's what a Devon looks like!

I tried to find out whos it was (with a secret dream of being able to buy
it for $100) but the people at the station weren't very friendly.
Apparently it belongs to one of the mechanics who worked there but wasn't
around right now - he had bought it recently, they said.

Busses of any sort are rare here in Dallas, and to find one like this
was... incredible!  I wonder how it got here?  I may still try to track
down the owner in case he loses interest in it.
