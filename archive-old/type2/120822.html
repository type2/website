&lt;&lt; Mike,    With your style engine replacing the push rod tube seals is
cake. I would start with that and trying to get your valve cover
gasket to stop. Clean the area up real good and then see where else
the oil comes from.

You might hafta call around, but there should be a FLAPS in your
area that carries fluorescent oil dye (mine is by Wurth)...Comes
in a small jar and a little is all you need. Drop the prescribed a-
mount into the oil at eventide and a black light will make the
dye glow as it starts to leak from the engine...An incandescent
black light bulb is available from your local party goods supplier.
The Eastwood Co. has a kit but it's way overpriced for what it 
is... ;-(
