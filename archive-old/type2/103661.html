&gt; &gt; I am trying to get LED's behind the original taillight lenses so that it
&gt; &gt; looks stock but has bright lights so you can be seen, starting with
&gt; &gt; stop/tail lights, hope to get turn signals working too, not going to
&gt; &gt; bother with backup light.
&gt; 
&gt; My idea regarding LED taillights is to drill a stock lens for the LEDs so
&gt; that the focusing lens of the LED protrudes and aims the beam straight
&gt; rearward.  On the inside of the lens would be a short wiring harness that
&gt; ends in a &quot;bulb base&quot; plug that will plug into the stock socket.  One set
&gt; of LEDs will handle the tail light function.  Another will handle the
&gt; stop/turn function.  The two sets will be in different parts of the lens
&gt; so that brake/turn function will be more obvious.
&gt; 
&gt; Trying to get LEDs to act like the incandescent bulbs inside the stock
&gt; housing doesn't seem to work well.  I've seen quite a few attempts, but
&gt; none really successful.  LEDs are different critters!

I've read up on most attempts, but I'm going to try a different route, I
work in the transit industry and there are commercial grade LED lights
that have both running/stop in the same housing (check out the nearest new
transit bus) I am trying to make a new housing to replace the current
housing that will use the commercial LED's and fit behind the current
lens,  mostly because of NHTSA rules the lights I'm using are too big and
need to be cut down, that is where the challenge lies, they are real picky
about how they are cut down, not to mention they are pricey...I expect
based on current prices that it will cost $50-75 per side plus the work
involved but I want more light back there.
