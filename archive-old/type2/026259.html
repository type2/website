Subject: Rust under pop-top

I have been looking for a VW Westfalia in Florida for a few months now and
have not found much.  They all seem to be suffering from bad rocker panel,
door, and floor board rust.  I did find one that looks excellent from the
rain rail down(almost no rust at all) but the pop-top seal leaked and it has
rust in the roof and rain rail area.  Is this repairable?  Would I be better
off with a bus with rust in the lower areas of the body?

Thanks for any advice.
Paul
