Subject: Re: [T2] Annoying FI Issue w/ cold engine

Sounds to me like you need to change the temp sensor II.  Did you change 
that out with a known good sensor?  When you have cold-start problems, 
that's one of the first things to test, especially if the car is running 
fine when warm.

&gt; annoying the bejeebers out of me.
