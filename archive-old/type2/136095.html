&gt; Then, on the way home and looking for a flower shop (15th anniversary)
&gt; and of course there are no more to be found, push on the clutch pedal
&gt; and hear a &quot;TTTWANGGGG&quot; and the pedal goes to the floor.

Sorry, but the judges don't consider a broken clutch cable to be a
&quot;stranding&quot;.  You could still get home by starting it in first gear
and then gingerly working your way through the gears without the clutch.
