&gt; My inclination will be to order brand-new heads ($130/ea.) rather than
&gt; buying rebuilt at all.  Especially given what I've heard about original
&gt; dual-port T1 heads being prone to cracking 

IMHO I learned long ago to spend my money on new heads.
I think rebuilt heads are a crap shoot and usually have been run so hot that 
they are soft and prone to valve seat sinkage.
I couldn't keep em in my bus for more than 5k miles without a problem 
arising.
My new heads have over 30k miles and show no sign of surrender.
