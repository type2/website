OK, I have experimented with my heater under different conditions and I'm
reporting back. 

At idle, vehicle not moving, with the heater fan on and all air directed
to defrosters so I can feel it conveniently with my finely calibrated
hand, I get very little hot air from my heater. This I take to be the
output of my electric heater fan plus a small contribution from engine fan
at idle, run through my leaky heater hoses. 

Revving engine, vehicle not moving, I get a lot more heater air. Obviously
the engine fan is putting out a lot more than the little electical fan
does. 

Driving at freeway speed, engine revving, I get a lot of air. Fairly 
comparable to what I was getting at idle with motor revving. Maybe a 
little more. Differences are near limits of detection with my hand/ 
airflow sensor.

Coasting at freeway speed, foot off the gas for 8-10 seconds letting
engine slow to near idle speed, I get somewhat more air than I was getting
while idling with vehicle at rest. Could the difference be ram jet air
from positive pressure in engine compartment? Where else might it come
from? When coasting at freeway speed, engine is not sucking in as much
air, so engine compartment pressure might be higher than it would be when
driving at freeway speed with engine revving (and sucking lots of air out
of compartment). 

So there you have it, Volks.
