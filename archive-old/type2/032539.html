S. Africans Fight Crime with Flamethrowers in Cars

Reuters
11-DEC-98

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (Reuters) - Crime-obsessed South Africans have a 
new, potent weapon with which to deter potential criminals: the car 
flamethrower. 

Casting a man-high fireball with no damage to the paintwork, the aptly named 
Blaster has been fitted to 25 South African vehicles since its launch last 
month. 

At 3,900 rand ($655), it offers a cheap, dramatic defense against would-be 
carjackers. It has also yet to be deemed illegal. 

South African courts sanction lethal action if they can be persuaded that 
someone acted in defense of his or her life -- not unheard-of in a country 
that suffered over 13,000 carjackings last year. 

The Blaster fires liquefied gas from a bottle in the vehicle trunk through two 
nozzles, positioned under the front doors, which is then ignited by an 
electric spark, with ferocious consequences. 

Both sides fire simultaneously, regardless of whether the attack is coming 
from just one side of the vehicle -- or whether passersby are on the other 
side. 

&quot;My personal feeling is that it would definitely blind a person -- he will 
never see again,&quot; said Charl Fourie, the Blaster's 33-year-old inventor. 

But he dismissed fears that the flamethrower -- whose breadth and depth of 
blast can be adjusted to need -- could ever be responsible for a death. 

&quot;This is definitely non-lethal. ... A person won't just stand there and let 
you roast him,&quot; he said. 

Fourie has filed an international patent application and anticipates thousands 
of orders, nationally and from abroad. 

&quot;The demand is huge,&quot; he told Reuters Television. 

The Blaster's first buyer was Police Superintendent David Walkley of 
Johannesburg's crime intelligence unit, who is satisfied it is all above board 
-- provided it is used correctly. 

&quot;There is nothing that says this is illegal. It depends entirely on the 
circumstances and whether you can justify self-defense,&quot; he said. 

&quot;Yes, there are certain risks in using it, but there are also risks in not 
having anything at all.&quot;
