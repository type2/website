&gt;-Becker 11 band short wave converter that mixes SW down to AM 500 kC to 1.6

&gt;-Hirschmann telescopic arial, can be taken out up  to 2 meters length

&gt;I would'nt want to swap the sound of SW listening to a CD -Player.
&gt;Next step?
&gt;A Blaupunkt CB12 Radio including 12 Frequencies of AM 2way CB-Radio.

I consider this a proper customization of the original design to accomadate
uses not contemplated for the production vehicle. All German components. It
would not work worth squat unless Michael has more than middlin' skills
with radio equipment. I bet he soldered all the terminal connections as
well. I also suspect that all the wires are at least one guage larger than
might ever be needed. 

Still waiting to install my Blaupunck Berlin dual gooseneck control 8
speaker cassette stereo system in something.  It monitors background noise
to raise and lower volume automatically to maintain listening decibles at
high end autobahn speeds. Early 80's design.  Did you know that Blaupunckt
is the radio branch of Bosch?
