I just got a '71 Camper.  I need to go through everything to make sure =
it's all good.  I especial want to redo all of the gas lines.  Here's =
the questions:

1. How many feet of hose will I need and how many clamps?

2. Would it be easier to pull the engine to get it all, or can it be =
done without?  I haven't pulled an engine yet, so this would greatly =
increase the complexity, but I want to do the best job I can.

Thanks!
