&gt;The cotter pin to my rear right wheel broke and let the axel nut spin off,

&gt;if anybody has any advice, input, or experience with this problem?

I torque the nut to factory specs. and install a new cotter pin, so I
have no experience with this problem.

Didn't you wonder what all that noise was, when the cotter pin was
banging around inside the hubcap, for all those miles, before the
nut worked its way off?
