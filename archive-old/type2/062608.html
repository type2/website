&gt;       I just installed an auxiliary battery isolated from the main
&gt;battery in my '71 Westy.  I have also connected a DC to AC power inverter
&gt;to the auxiliary battery. The inverter is capable of putting out 400 watts
&gt;continuously. That is at least twice the power I need to run my computer
&gt;and monitor. 
&gt;       My question is: Is it safe (for my computer) to run my computer
&gt;while the engine is running? If so, is it safe to start or stop the engine
&gt;while running my computer?

Should be perfectly safe.
