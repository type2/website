Without access to my 1992 VDO Instruments calalogue, I am not sure about the 
form and dimensions of the VDO 360006 oil-pressure gauge sender or the 
associated adapter.

Hovever, I seriously question the wisdom of enlarging the hole in the 
sheet-steel coverplate, of a 1972-83 VW 17/18/2000 Type 2, in order to fit 
the oil-pressure gauge sender, directly into the M10 x 1.0mm tapped hole, in 
the crankcase, near the oil cooler. This is a viable method of installation, 
but is hardly conducive to ease of maintenance. To either fit or replace the 
oil-pressure gauge sender, would involve removing the large left-hand 
coverplate and left-hand inlet manifold, etc., in order to gain access for 
an  open-ended spanner (crow-foot wrench to our colonial cousins, across the 
pond!).

Using only a vertical adapter, would involve problems of interference with 
the ignition distributor, as already stated and may make it impossible to 
correctly set the ignition timing, owing to the position of the distributor 
cap retaining clips.

Sometime ago, I investigated several possible ways of fitting an 
oil-pressure gauge sender, to my 1911cc, VW Type 2/4 hybrid engine with and 
without a separate oil-pressure switch, including those described above; 
both of which I emphatically rejected. All of these I documented and 
photographed, which has been prepared in draft form as a detailed article. 
The British VW Type 2 Owners' Club, may publish it as a Technical 
Information Booklet, if it so chooses!

In summary, the two most viable options, are either to use a flexible 
oil-resistant hose, connected to a remote mounted oil-pressure gauge sender 
or to use a rigid adapter with some sort of elbow joint, on order to avoid 
interference, with the ignition distributor.

For my own engine, I chose the latter option, using a 50mm (i.e. 2 inch) 
vertical spacer mast and banjo fittings, both of which had M10 x 1.0mm 
threads. One banjo fitting came from the brake master cylinder of a 
mid-1970s BMW and the other from the oil-preesure switch engine-block 
tapping, of a water-cooled VW or Audi. The spacer mast was made using two 
25mm female-female, in-line hydraulic brake pipe connectors and 
bored-through VW 2000 Type 2, valve-tappet adjustment screws.

Regards.
