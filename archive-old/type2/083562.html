Subject: 73 sink/icebox for sale at Buses &amp; Boats

I have a 73 sink/icebox that I will haul to Buses &amp; Boats this weekend
if someone is interested in it.  It is complete and pictures of it can
be seen at the web address below.  I would like $100.00 for it.  I
will not bring it along if no one is interested in it.

Thanks,
Kevin
