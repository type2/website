welcome back

&gt; my buses the way I once used to. (poor health always seems to get the better
&gt; of me but I am vowing this year to try even harder!!!!)

yeah stuff like that can be a real pain

&gt;   1970 bus, stock as far as I can tell, ran fine when we bought it,drove
&gt; it home couple hundred miles just fine, parked it and it has never wanted to
&gt; start right since. The coil has been replaced, as have the plugs, wires, and
&gt; battery. It will turn over but will not catch. We ran a starter bypass
&gt; switch and it still will not catch. Fuel is moving into the fuel filter. How
&gt; do I find where the fire stops? Any advice will be GREATLY appreciated....
&gt;
OK I have fuel injection so I'm a little rusty on the older buses but all
engines have a few basics.

you gotta have fuel
you gotta have fire (electric)
you gotta have compression

so you check em one at a time from the cyl back to where it stops.

fuel.

  does the engine flood???
  can you get it started with starter fluid (D-method disapproval)
  is you carb(s) working
  are you intake valves opening correctly (set valve gaps)

fire
  do the spark plugs get fire,  check with a gap to see if it arc's
  check gap in points
  check coil for spark

compression
  do a compression test, (need a compression tester, $20 at Flaps)

this should keep you busy for a few hours ,  good luck

Bob
