Subject: RE: Suspension differences '74 vs '79

As far as I know there are no 74-79 differences. However, throughout
production two different rear torsion bars were available. A soft version -
mostly used on passenger vans - and a stiffer version for trucks and
delivery vans. Campers may have the stiff version, but I am not sure. You
could also order the stiffer version for delivery with regular vans. To find
out which one you have, check the M-codes of your bus: if it says something
like increased payload than you have the stiffer version. Alternatively,
take apart your rear suspension and check the color of our torsion bars. One
is green, the other is brown - but I am not sure which is which ...

Front spring rates should be identical for all versions.

Hope this helps,
Marcus

Can anyone tell me if there are differences in the
suspension between '74 and '79?
