The Nazi invasion of Czechoslovakia allowed (?) many officers to com-
mandeer Tatras for their personal use. The V8 was very fast, but due
to the rear weight bias and swing axles was, shall we say, unforgiving
in the hands of someone not acquainted with its pecadillos. After
losing more than a few officers, the word came down that disciplinary
action would be taken against any officer driving a Tatra for personal 
use...
