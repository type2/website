Subject: Re: [T2] Stumped! No power-1641 DP

Thanks for all your suggestions.  You all said...
&gt;
&gt; Verify that TDC *is* TDC....I suspect you know how.

Did that and double checked.
&gt;
&gt; Then go back thru the engine cycles by hand and watch the valves.
&gt; Measure if possible....in other words, a cam going flat???

Haven't done that exactly but the valves do move with a turning engine
and the AVP short block is only 10K miles old.

&gt; Had a friend come to me like that one time and he was stumped...turns
&gt; out
&gt; he had replaced the solid copper plug wires with resistance wires....

I have bought new wires from 2 different sources without a change in
performance but you never know....

&gt; I assume that you have checked advance with a timing light and it works?

009 7-10 BTDC idle, 28-32 deg. total.  Seems to have a normal advance.
&gt;
&gt; Does the accelerator pump work?....

I think so.  It accelerates smoothly from stop to 10 MPH or so, then
loses steam.
&gt;
&gt; Triple check the wires being in the right places...don't ask me how I
&gt; know....it will run, but poorly.

Done that several times.  Will do again with an open mind.
&gt;
&gt; Triple check dp manifold to carb runner seals.

Had a small leak early on, they are fully set and tight now.
&gt;
&gt; You didn't mention if you did a compression test .... do a wet and dry
&gt; compression test and give us your numbers ... otherwise you are
&gt; shooting in
&gt; the dark trying to guess what's wrong.

Between 110 and 117, less than 5 lbs. more wet.

&gt; How about swapping for another known good carb? Maybe the new one has
&gt; too
&gt; low a float level?

Tried 3 different carbs with no significant difference.

&gt; First check your plugs, I use  Bosch w8ac plugs. then check your dwell
&gt; then timing, also check that you are getting at least 30 degrees total
&gt; advance from the dizzy. I'm betting your plugs have gotten fouled.

Bosch plugs in, new and good.  Using pertronix ignition, (I also put in
points and set dwell to verify it wasn't a problem).  See above re:
dizzy.

&gt; Considering all you say you've done, my first question would be, 'how
&gt; did you test your fuel pump'?  It may be pumping adequately while
&gt; turning over, but not at higher RPMs.

Now this is the idea that is most intriguing of all.  I assumed that the
fuel pump was a go/nogo kind of part.  But if the diaphragm is damaged
(rusty gas had gone through it), and it doesn't keep the float bowl
full, could it create a fuel starvation scenario, poor power at speed?
HMMMM.  Might be worth $20 to find out.  In a way, it's the only part
left.
