Subject: Trip Report: The Redwoods

Hey now,
     It's 10:30 AM 17 July, we're at the Riverwoods campground, about 40
miles south of Crecsent City. It's a nice little campground/RV site set on
the Klamath river, just outside of the Redwoods National Park. The price was
right, only $10, no pet charge, and showers are included. Much better deal
than the $16 NPS sites, which were full anyway.
     Yesterday we finished off the northern stretch of PCH, stopping in Fort
Bragg at Safeway for some supplies at more reasonable prices, and continuing
up to this area. PCH was a wonderfully scenic route, but it was nice to get
to the 101 and not deal with hairpin turns anymore. 
     While looking for ampsites, we found the perfect place. Gold Rush Beach,
I believe was the name. It's about 3 miles north of Orick on 101, and you
turn off the 101 onto a winding dirt road. 4 miles later you emerge at the
beach, and the campground is on the beach. We saw 3 bull elk on the way, no
more than 10 feet from us. Big suckers. Glad they don't mind VW busses in
thier territory, I'd hate to get one of them mad at me...  Problem was, it
was packed solid. 25 or so spaces, every last one occupied-on a Tuesday no
less. I can see why, it's a remarkably scenic area. Problem was, we had no
more film, so we didn't get any elk pictures. I suppose we'll see more of 'em
in Canada.
     Today we will leave the Golden State. It will be a sad occasion, as we
likely will not be back for a year or two. We both miss our home state
already, but adventure lies ahead, so onward we will go. 
     The weather here is marvelous. It's overcast all morning, and it stays
very comfortable all the time, much better than the heat of Texas. I think
yesterday it got to about 65 in the afternoon, just perfect. We both enjoyed
the PCH run, and will likely settle down somewhere up there when we leave
Texas. 
     After about 1 hour of driving we will cross the Oregon border, and
continue on 101 north. Our trusty &quot;California Camping&quot; by Tom Sienstra
(highly reccomended-packed with little known sites and vital information, and
*very* accurate) will no longer be able to guide us, so we will likely spend
some time trying to find a campsite in Oregon. Perhaps around Gold Beach, as
I would like to take the mailboat ride up the Rouge river. We shall see.
     It's starting to rain lightly so I must stash the Powerbook. Our good
wishes to all who remain at home, and we look forward to meeting everyone in
several days time up at Tobin's house in Vancouver. Northward Ho!!!
Peace,
Eddie
