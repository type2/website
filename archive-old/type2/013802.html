&gt;For my type 4 they were about 60 a piece, thats $240 total.
&gt;I think your &quot;pricing&quot; them at the wrong place.

I'm going to knock BD on this one.  Lucas replacement injectors
(and don't laugh Bosch owns them and it isn't like it used to be)
for the bus and vanagon are about $30 each from Autozone or
Advanced around me.  Now I know Ron is probably selling Bosch,
but he should be selling the Lucas, they are in fact the newer anti
fouling tip design (which does mean they tend to seat a little worse
so you have to pay careful attention to installation) and are quite
obviously, half the price.

Anyway they were $25 each till about a year ago, and even now
I think Autozone may still give the &quot;lifetime warranty&quot; on what is
a part equal to Bosch in quality.  So for $120 it is foolish not to
replace all 4 when you install a new engine, etc.  This injector is
used in American cars (maybe 80's caddies?) which drives the
price from the major parts stores.  Don't pay too much folks.
I've had these for 6 years in the '77, 5 years in the '81/'82, and
Dolan is running a set going on 3 years in the '80.  One or maybe
both of these stores no longer list the Bus but just have them look
up a '81 49 state Vanagon and buy them.
