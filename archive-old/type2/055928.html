&gt;Subject: Yet another question concerning pop-tops
&gt;Namely, all the descriptions of transferring a pop-top to a non-pop-top
&gt;loaf involved welding up there.  My question is, is this welding done for
&gt;the purposes of the bed on top?  If I had no intention of using the top
&gt;as a bed is this topside welding still necessary?
&gt;I know that the pop-tops had some reinforcements welded in on the under
&gt;side.
&gt;I would like to put a pop-top on my '78.

I am in the middle of rebuilding a '73 devon with a pop top, when the top
was
fitted they cut a large hole and peeled back the edges to create a lip. They
reinforced the corners of this hole by blind riveting metal plates which
then
had the catches screwed on. They cut the centre reinforcing beam and folded
the edges back on this as well. There was no welding.

However if the coach builder included some welding I guess they did for a
reason
such as to cope with the weight of the top, believe you me they are heavy
and
weigh much more than the recommended maximum weight for a roof rack.

However if you can leave your van off the road for a couple of days is there
any
harm in doing what you can, poping the roof on for the night and then
removing
it for the next days work?
