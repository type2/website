Yes, it's pretty nice.  Also check out Joshua Tree - great camping there.

For a nice weekend drive, take the Sunrise Highway off of I-8 just past Alpine.  Take chains in the winter.

&gt;Anyone down here know a great aircooled mechanic? (Not good, great!)

Lots of people swear by Rich's VW - I believe they are on Bacon street in Pt. Loma.  I never had any work done there personally but I did stop by and chat with the mechanics once and they seemed like a good bunch.

For a machine shop, I recommend ForMac in La Mesa.  Tell Clark I said hi.  Also Pauter machine has been recommended by many but I've not used them (I think they are in Chula Vista).

For parts, you have Vee Parts in El Cajon and National City, and Harloff in La Mesa.
