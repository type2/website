&gt; &gt;If you have a black wire,,,
&gt;
&gt; My documentation with my alternator said some had
&gt; ground wires.  I think it specifically said that
&gt; some motorola's were on some VW's.  Makes sense
&gt; 'cause black is ground in 'mericun wiring.
&gt; (Brown is ground in euro wiring.)  Right?
&gt;

Well,, I know this one isn't ground,, it is as LIVE as the red wire... always live.

And they are bosch alternators.....
The wiring diagrams show a black wire for the &quot;test network&quot;, or diagnostic plug coming from the
B+ terminal on the alternator.
