Subject: 1700 into a 71 bus

Has anyone put a type 4 in there 71 bus before, The 1600 we have is shot but 
we have a good running 1700 except for some leak, (previous email about 
welding) but wanted to know if anyone has put one in an earlier bus like our 
71, and what about hooking up the altenator instead of the generator. thanks
