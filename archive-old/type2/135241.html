Subject: [T2] Windshield Wiper Questions - Follow-up

Wayne,
         Concerning your loosey-goosey wiper assembly, the quickest fix I know 
is to find a good replacement unit, perhaps from a wreck.  You can spend hours 
upgrading your present wiper linkage assembly, assuming you have access to a 
good machine shop.... much easier to begin your rebuild with parts (shafts, 
link connectors) that are not badly worn.  Where are you located, 
geographically speaking?  Have a great T'giving..... Glenn

My wiper motor is fine (PO replaced it). but the linkage pivots are very
loose.   Is there a (simple) fix for this?
