Don't do it.  Don't post.  Possible the easiest way to make me really,
Really, REALLY upset is to waste the time of 1000 people with a rumor you
have not checked.  I know we were all new to the net once and for
those who are currently undergoing that painful process, the address is:

If you have further questions write me, not the list.
