Subject: Re: [T2] 72 bus on the samba

The space under the seat is a plus. I carry the spare tire, jumper cables, 
tow strap,
electric air pump, safety triangles, wheel chokes, the stock jack, tools, 
work clothes,
a spot light, various cans of liquids, and spare parts.   In the old times 
we even used to carry
&quot;contraband&quot; meat from France into Switzerland in the spare tire space.

&lt;&lt;sip&gt;&gt;

&gt;other reasons. ;) It also has a perfect place under
&gt;the seat made to hold the spare tire. There is still
&gt;plenty of room to haul tools or other small items
&gt;under there. ...

&gt;... The one bad thing about this is that it does make the
&gt;rear area appear smaller and you have to exit the
&gt;front of the vehicle just to get into the back...

Have a great time and keep warm.
