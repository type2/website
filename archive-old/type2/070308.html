Subject: 79 Westy Wheels

The stock 14&quot; x 5.5&quot; wheels on our 79 Westy are missing the hubcaps and
are quite rusted having lived on the NorCal Coast. I'm thinking of
replacing or upgrading the tires and wheels. It would be nice to have
all wheels and tires the same size. We do about 90% highway, 10% dirt --
anyone have a recommendation? Also, any ideas on minimizing freeway
squirreliness? Sway bars, lowered spindles?

Thanks,
Tom
