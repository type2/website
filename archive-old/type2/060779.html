       What I used is fiber-reinforced vacuum hose from Fleet-Farm. I think
it's for milking machines. Anyway, it was pretty much dirt cheap compared to
those prices. And -- it's one heck of a lot sturdier than the orginal stuff.

       Don't know what your problem with the manifold fitting size is,
because I never had that problem. Orignally I had a Weber progressive carb,
and manifold vacuum fitting on that was same size as the hose. Now that I
have FI restored, that, too, is the same size.
