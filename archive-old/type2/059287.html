Subject: Color Wiring Diagrams

Volks,

Do you know that the early printings of the Bentley manual for our busses
contained color wiring diagrams?  And that the recent printings do not?

Well, I have an early printing, and it has got to the point where the
wiring diagrams are falling out of it, so to be sure I could always
retrieve them, and since I just got an upgraded SCSI card for my scanner,
I have begun scanning them in.

Now, on the one hand, I know it is a violation of copyright to post these
to the web (not to mention - the scans are *huge* - ~1.5M per page!), so I
will not be doing that.  At the same time, I know it falls within the
&quot;fair use&quot;  exemption to make copies for personal use.  So I know I'm OK
doing the scanning but what I need to know is am I OK sending copies to
people who request them?  Am I/they still covered by &quot;fair use&quot;? Does
anyone *know*?  If you have some certain knowledge, please P-mail me at
dworkin_at_ari_dot_net.  (DO NOT post to the list!!!!) I would like to get these
out, but I would like to stay inside the lines, too.
