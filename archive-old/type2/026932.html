((Type 2, are you there?? I feel like I'm a-knocking but there ain't no-body 
home!?!?))

Anyway, like remember a while back when I could not get my starter to turn 
over? Well, when I pulled the starter/solenoid I discovered that one of the 
two screws that hold the solenoid to the starter was missing (like in 
'gone'!!') and the other was loose.

(OK, joke about it.  Dude's got a screw loose, ya, ya, ya  . . .)

Seems that I did not tighten the screws enough (by definition - if a screw 
falls off the VW in less than 5K miles of normal day-to-day running, it 
wern't tightened enough.) when I cobbled this '78 and '72 starter together.  
Man, am I torked/torqued/torxed off...

Might just have something to do with why the solenoid a-didn't want to kick 
in.  Then again, might not, and I might still have a gremlin in the '78 
waiting to bite me when the weather turns cold, dark and slipery.
