Subject: removing key drilling hole in ignition

Ok, so I've managed to get things pretty much apart. I removed the sheer 
bolt by sticking an allen wrence that was slightly to large in the end and 
turning it. Came right out.
So, now I'm at the part where you are supposed to drill a hole and depress a 
spring so you can remove the lock.
This makes me a little nervous. The bently has a picture of where to drill 
the hole. But how deep? and someone said they drilled right through the 
spring. How did you fix that? Also, which way is the spring facing. Is it 
going to pop out? How big is it? If this is the way vw intended for it to be 
removed than why isn't there a hole there already. Do I have to fill the 
hole when I reassemble it?
Also, there is a funny looking plate that pops out. It is shaped like   ___
                                                                             
                 l     l
                                                                             
                 l_  _l
                                                                             
                   U

something like that. Anyway, what is it. I can make it push in and out and I 
noticed if i look at the hole where the steering column passes through that 
this panel has a spring which pushes som e kind of a lobe in and out. Is 
this the steering lock?

Thanks,
I've almost got it.
