Hey Y'all,
I posted last week that I failed Ohio E-Check twice in my Vanagon (CO too high).  Not wanting to put out a bunch of money on the van, I went to my local FLAPS (NAPA) and asked if they had something to add to my gas.  They gave me a product called, get this, &quot;Guaranteed to Pass&quot;.  You put it in a full tank, run it to almost empty and then re-fill your tank and take the test.  It claims to lowere CO by 13-17%.  Sure enough I passed with flying colors.  I know someone jkust posted with this same problem on their VAnagon, hope this helps.




Peace, John Baker
