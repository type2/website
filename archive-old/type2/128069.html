Subject: info cards.. admin? air intake mods...

ok admin volks... if you get some submissions
for a infocard and approve the content would it
be an option to stick a downloadeable PDF
file on the type2 site?

Bus tech stuff: Has anyone ever had success opening
up the air flow to carbs without having problems
with carb iceing? Or is this concept even worth
thinking
about? The stock setup looks like it is restrictive..
or is it more than enough for the stock dual solex
setup..
opinions welcome!
