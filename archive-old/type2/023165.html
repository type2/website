You need the file the heater box to head mating surfaces - you use a long 
file and file both pipes at once - it gets them into the same plane. Once 
both pipes have a shiny or silver color then you've gottent he job done. 
Reinstall with new gaskets.



  &lt;the right heat exchanger STILL is not mating properly (but is quite 
improved)&gt;
