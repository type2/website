TOMORROW!!!

H. Steve Dolan, Visiting Dignitary BBQ
Cabrillo Beach in San Pedro ~1:00. There is a nominal parking fee, but
plenty of parking, a picnic area, a really neat little marine museum
that kids just love, a playground, and of course, the beach.
BYOBus/Beer/BBQ. Die-hard partiers can come over to my place when it
gets dark or we get kicked off the beach (whichever comes first), and
there's room for 6-8
campers in the alley behind my house.

Take whichever freeway you prefer to the 110 (Harbor Fwy) SOUTH. 
At the end, Gaffey St., GO LEFT. 
At 22nd St., GO LEFT. 
At Pacific Ave., GO RIGHT. 
At Stephen White Blvd., GO LEFT.
