&gt; Hi all, 
&gt; runs great and has new 8 ply 185R14 tires on it with a recent alignment.  It

What probably needs replacing:

drag link, both tie rods, ball joints. (if they need boots they are for
sure toast, i'd bet $20 on it...)

Then diagnose the swing lever pivot pin and bushings, that is often bad
due to lack of proper service/hi miles.

If that doesnt fix it, how new are your shocks?  I recommend gas
shocks.  I use the ones from Advance auto parts, their customer service
sucks, but they have white gas shocks for like $11 each, to me they look
act and perform like gas adjusts.  I've only had em a few months, but the
instruction booklet even looked like it was from the same plant, hehe.

I have gas adjusts on my 71, and the Advance specials on my 61, they seem
the same to me.

If that doesnt cure your problem, learn how to diagnose/adjust the
steering gear box, i've thought i had a bad one of those like 4 or 5
times, but it has always turned out to be the other stuff i mentioned.

I have a 71 bus and in all but an oklahoma windstorm (dont ask, midnight
run to texas, gusting winds blowing me 2 lanes hither and yon, i've never
been so grateful for no traffic.) The bus has kept reasonably stable after
i fixed what needed fixing. And i use passenger tires out of cheapness,
with truck tires you should be golden!

take care,

Steve
