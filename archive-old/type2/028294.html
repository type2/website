As promised, below is the information on the front doors, as provided to me
by the supplier in Europe in response to your questions.  (Please excuse the
&quot;shouting&quot; - I just copied it right off his note, didn't feel like retyping
everything.)  With this info, you now know as much as I do about them.  If
other questions arise, please let me know.  Again, I'm not exactly &quot;pushing&quot;
these on anyone - actually they'd be quite a pain in the neck to box up, not
something I'm looking forward to - but if anyone wants them I can order them
in at $499.95/pair plus freight if you let me know ASAP before my container
leaves.

HINGE AND LOCK WISE THESE DOORS FIT 1969&gt;75 WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM. WITH A
DOOR HINGE CONVERSION KIT AT $15 PER DOOR, YOU CAN FIT THEM TO
1976&gt;79. THE DOOR DOES COME WITH THE HOLE FOR DOOR PULL / LOCK BY THE
WINDOW, THIS CAN BE WELDED UP IF NOT NEEDED.

THESE ARE THE LAST GENUINE VW DOORS THAT ARE THE SAME AS GERMAN MADE ONES.
THESE ARE SMOOTH OUTSIDE (NO SWAGE AS ON THE NEW BRAZIL BUSES)

1975 ONLY (I THINK) HAS A DIFFERANT LOCATED INNER DOOR LOCK / OPENER. ON
THESE FEW VECHICLES YOU NEED TO SIMPLY REDRILL 2 HOLES AND NUT AND BOLT THE
LOCK ON.

IF YOU WANT WE CAN INCLUDE TECH SHEET OF ANY MODS THAT ARE APPLICABLE TO
ANY YEAR WITH THE DOORS.

WE SELL ABOUT 3 PAIRS A DAY...BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE FED UP WITH THE USED DOORS,
HAVING TO STRIP OFF THE OLD PAINT ETC.
