Subject: RE: [T2] Upgrading to H4s

David--

Quite elementary---two relays two seperate 12v feed wires--

Why overload a single wire if you don't have to?

What, you want to use 00 wire to both relays?
Kewl----

Not necessary---2 individual 10 or 12 ga. wires fed to each relay works
out real nice--- why not use a single ground tied into each relay?

You can get a better ground off two wires than one of the same gauge.

Anyway this is the way the relay update is wired in both my Vanagons,
and soon to be in my 74 Westy---and the difference is worth mentioning.

One of the better moves I have made on those vehicles mentioned.

Later,


TK

They do function better with two seperate feed wires to the hot lead to
the fuse box, and two seperate grounds, one to each relay.

Please explain why they function better with two separate feed wires.
The electricity does not care whether it is one wire or two as the
source and destination are the same.
