Subject: RE: Fuel Neck - Possible fix?

  e-Volks:  I was reading about the idea of using some sort of liquid
plastic 
to &quot;patch&quot; cracked filler neck rubber which is a major PITA to replace.
I was wondering if it would be possible to use the stuff they use
 to repair gas tanks with. I've had a few tanks in old cars fixed
where they coated the inside of the tank with some sort of 
liquid plastic type stuff.
I'm wondering:
What is this stuff? 
Where could I get some?
Would it be compatible with the rubber in the filler neck?

and the piece de resistance 
Drum Roll Please!

Would it be possible to do the fix by swabbing it into the filler neck in
situ?
What sort of cleaning do I need first?
What would happen if a bit of the liquid got into a tank containing gas?
Would it gum everything up, or would it just harden into some weird 
shaped lumps, and stay in the bottom of the tank? 
What if I drained, and dried the tank first without removing it?

If this works it could be a really quick fix compared to the alternatives.
