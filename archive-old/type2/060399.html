Subject:      michelin/tires

i've run the XZX michelien tires for about 20 years and never had any
problems with their wear or quality ... however, one thing that i've noticed
about the radial tires of ANY manufacturer: they do NOT like being reversed
from side to side when you rotate the tires. that is, once the tire rolls
for about 10,000 miles or so on the LEFT side, don't swap it to the RIGHT
side (where it's rolling &quot;backwards&quot; from what it's been doing).

it SEEMS (to me, with some confirmation from a couple of tire store people
that i went to high school with) that the steel-belts in the radial take up
some sort of &quot;set&quot;, and running them backwards tends to make them want to
come apart. this is mostly true with the tires from the 1970's and 1980's,
and especially with tires with lots of miles on them.

basically, the tire tread kinda comes off the carcass of the tire ... it
sorta disintegrates, like those big truck recaps you see laying around on
the interstate highways.

so this MIGHT have been what started the thread on the other list, and what
people have seen in isolated incidents over the years. in 28 years of buses,
i've had ONE tire go bad like that on me. so, right or wrong (according to
the tire companies and experts), i do NOT swap sides when rotating tires ...
i just go front to back and vice versa on the same side. the spare? it stays
in the spare well .... never gets on the ground. yeah, yeah, i know. but
that's the way i do it. :)

i did,however, have some flat tires on Michelins .... a piece of welding rod
(overhead bridge construction) and a catfish spine (driving across a fishing
bridge down on the gulf). both times, the tire just slowly went flat.
