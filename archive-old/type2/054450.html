Subject: Looking for a driveway or two...

Okay, assuming that I get this beast all tuned up in the next day or
two, I'm heading out of this swamp of Houston.  The first leg of my
journey will be to see my folks in Nebraska, so I'll be travelling north
along I-45 and I-35 for a good bit.  Anybody in Dallas/Fort Worth, OK
City, or Wichita areas who wants to give up their driveway to a
travelling computer science teacher?  I'll be happy to earn my keep
doing whatever you deem necessary.  Well, just about any thing.  :)  I'd
like to start travelling in the next few days, so let me know via p-mail
if you're interested.  Also, if you're along the way and want to meet a
fellow listmember, let me know.
