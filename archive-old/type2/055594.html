Subject: My 65 Sundial? vs. EZ

Hi All,
    I have seen other campers with the identical material on the seats that
I have. I was told they were Sundials. I didn't know at the time to look
for an ID tag. It is quite possible that I have a different kind of camper.

    I went to Seattle, WA last year for the big VW weekend that they have.
I saw all different types of campers I didn't know existed. At that time I
thought that I might not have a Sundial. One of the owners of a Kit Kamper
told me that the tell tale sign on a Sundial was that it has a wide strip
(about 3 inches) at the center seam of the headliner. He said all the
others had a narrower (about an inch) strip. I looked at the different
campers I saw and they all had narrower strips. I did not see an EZ camper
though. When I got back from Seattle I looked at the strip in my Bus and it
is indeed wider. I then figured that I must have a Sundial. I do not have
an ID tag anywhere on my bus. There isn't even any holes where a tag used
to be. 
   If anyone has any pictures of an EZ camper that they can send me I would
greatly appreciate it. I will send the pictures back. I'd be nice to know
for sure what I've got. 

Rick
65 Camper of some sort
