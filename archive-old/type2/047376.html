Subject: Re: [T2] The price is right!!!!

Well, since you brought it up....went camping this past weekend at the KOA in 
Front Royal. When I found my assigned spot, couldn't believe it, but right 
across from me was an '89 Westy. No one was around, but a couple hours later 
the owners showed up. They just bought it a few months ago. It was in 
showroom condition. The owner said the plastic shrink wrap was still on the 
stove! The purchase price: $4,900.00!!! The one thing I found interesting: 
neither buyer nor seller is on the Internet. I asked they couple if they were 
aware of Vanagon_dot_com and they said they had heard of it, but really weren't 
into the Internet (retired folks, early 60's). My feeling is the Internet is 
helping to push prices up. You can still get one for a decent price, but not 
from someone on the net!    Jeff S.
