Subject: --- where I are living ---

&gt;Where you live: State, city, and a nearest big city (to help me 
locate you on a map!

Corvallis, Oregon (near Burnt Woods and Shedd, about 90 miles south 
of Portland)
 
&gt;What is you van: year, model

69 Westy

&gt;What is your name:

Jerry Hull

&gt;What is the name of your van:

The WonderBug (named by #3 Daughter)

&gt;Do you think I can answer how old are you?? Or it's not 
appropriate?? 

No, but you can ASK how old I am.  I'm 52 and holding.


A word of appreciation to the Dreaded Previous Owners of the
Wonderbug.  They bought it new, camped with their family and kept it
until four years ago, and put about 150K on it.  They put in a new
engine and clutch, brakes, had a new paint job and had the seats
reupholstered (all receipts neatly packaged in the glove box) - and
then decided to buy a fifth-wheel trailer for their travels.  I saw
the van on the lot of our local VW dealer, and it was love at first
sight.  So....

Not all dreaded previous owners are - and I've never for a second 
been anything but delighted with my choice!!!
