Subject: Re: RE: [T2] Advice and/or part needed in PNW

Hiya Hal,

Well, I had to jump into this thread.................

Concerning parts sources in the Portland metro area; you really have to watch 
yourself.  My general feeling is that while parts ARE available here they 
tend to be way overpriced.  When one adds in the incompetence factor with some of 
the employees, it pays to look elsewhere for parts.  And I have a couple of 
ideas for you on that front.

But first, in going over Sean's comments;  a couple of opinions from one who 
has been to and done business with these places.  

Always V-Dub is not (strictly speaking) a boneyard.  Located on SE 50th they 
do not have a license to hold salvageable vehicles.  Rather, they take in 
salvageable vehicles and break them down into their component parts.  You will pay 
for the labor involved in this sort of set-up.  If you buy any part (of 
substance) you can assured that it will cost you a minimum of $10.  Most of the 
knowledgeable folks treat Always V-Dub as a last resort for parts.  They'll have 
it - and you'll pay for it.  But, by all means, go take a look at the store 
and get a feel for it.  Steve, the quiet guy, is really a nice fellow.  I'd be 
careful around Ashley though.

German Auto Parts out in Boring has got to be one of the worst run facilities 
anywhere.  Basically these guys are ill-informed, not overly bright, and 
pretty greedy (or paranoid).  I stopped by one day and asked about radios.  Told 
them I needed a Sapphire.  The kid told me they didn't have anything from the 
fifties.  I told him that I was looking for a radio from the seventies.  &quot;Naw, 
you're wrong&quot;, he says, &quot;they wuz only in VWs in the fifties&quot;.  I asked if I 
could look around.  &quot;No way&quot;.  It's amazing to me that this place even stays in 
business.

Pacific West out on Foster has its own set of quirks.  The counterman is an 
old hoot who knows everything about VWs.  Well, at least he thinks he does.  If 
that weren't annoying enough, the parts picking (yes, you can get out into 
the lot; a big plus) is not all that good.  Most of the stuff has been pretty 
well cleaned out.  And the parts they are holding on their shelves behind the 
counter leave a great deal to be desired.

Trafton's........I don't know.  But you can be sure that I'm going to check 
them out.  Thanks for the tip, Sean.

So for Portland.......check these places out.  But go through each door with 
your eyes wide open.

Now for the tips........When you can wait, make a shopping list and head out 
to Puyallup. Washington for the Springmeet (just last weekend) and Oktobugfest 
(this year on 10/17)  Cheapest parts shopping by a longshot.  Most of the 
vendors are NOT pros, but just other guys unloading parts.  I have bought a lot 
of parts at Puyallup and have yet to be disappointed with any of them.  Also 
look for other VW related swaps and shows.  We do have one at PIR in the summer. 
 But it is sponsored by Always V-Dub.  Can you guess why this isn't among my 
top ten?  Costs a small fortune ($10 last year) to get in and the pickings are 
not nearly as extensive as Puyallup.  Nevertheless, be aware of swaps and 
shows; generally they make for great shopping.

Or try heading outtatown for good cheap parts.  Carter &amp; Son in Chehalis is a 
great spot.  Autocraft in Salem often has good vehicles and reasonable 
prices.  Averre's in Longview tends to charge online prices for their parts.  
Sometimes that can make them pretty expensive.

Hope that lends some context to your understanding.  Good hunting!

Mike
