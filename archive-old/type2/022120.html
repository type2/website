Subject: wiring diagram for westy
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hi everybody,
 I have the complete wiring diagram for my 77 westy but it does not cover
the things the westfalia conversion added on.  Do any of you guys where I
can get this information.  In particular, I am trying to find out what this
relay connected to the left side of the engine bay does (it is mounted just
to the left of the top left side of the deck lid).  Of the things that plug
into this, one is a ground to the coach battery and I'm not sure what all
the other posts do.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Harry
