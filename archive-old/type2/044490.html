Subject: Re: [T2] what else to check?

Art Long sends:

&gt; I dropped the motor from my bus today, getting ready to replace the rear
&gt; main seal. I've ordered new seals for the oil cooler and while I have the
&gt; motor out, I'm going to check the torque on the new head that was installed
&gt; a couple of months ago.
&gt; 
&gt; The questions I have is: what else should I check while the motor is
&gt; dropped?

End play! Always, always, always check the crankshaft end play every time
you take the engine out! (Yes, I can be more emphatic, but this is a family
list.) 

Also check the torque on the old head. Check the torque on every fastener
you see.
