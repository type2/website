Subject: i'm not really sure, but it's probably important

Hi All,
I have a question, and you are all probably going to laugh at me, but well,
that's okay.  I was repairing/putting back the sliding door on my 78 bus, and
i was lying on the ground observng the roller, and i looked under the bus,
just cause I haven't in a while.  
To my surprise, I saw a pipe(like an exhaust pipe) that ran the width of the
bus, right under where the rear seat is.  I have no idea what this is, but it
has a little &quot;deflector thingy&quot; on the right side of it.  What I mean is
that, where the tube ends, on the drivers side, it stops where the side of
the bus stops and there is a little half cap on it.  I have no idea what it
is and normally would just leave it alone assumong that it has some purpose
which i don't need to know about, but there is a HUGE hole in it.  can
anybody help?

thanks a lot in advance,
jake vincent
