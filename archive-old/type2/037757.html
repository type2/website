Hi,

It is getting close! April 14 15 16 in North Carolina. All the info you
could ever need is located at www.mindspring_dot_com/~ncbus/ including
directions and contact info for others in your area that you can carabus
with. 

As of today it looks like there will be a huge massing of busses. No
reservations are necessary but the earlier you get there the better.

See ya soon!
