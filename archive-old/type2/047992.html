Subject: [T2] 1st start/fried my condensor wire

Hi all,

I turned the engine over today and after about 15 sec it didn't start.
So I turned it off and went back to check a few things.  Well,  there
was alot of smoke and the smell of fried plastic.  Come to find out that the condesor wire cover was cooked.  Kinda scared me.  I'm sure I've 
connected it right(#1 terminal on coil) but I'm wondering if something
was forgotten.  What sort of strange electrical occurences would cause
such a thing?  More then likely I've got something bassackwards.
A bit lost right now.  Suggestions welcome while I check the archives.
