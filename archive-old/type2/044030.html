Subject: [T2] Oil type?

Hi

The msg. from Brandon (&quot;82 Vanagon is hot!&quot;) &amp; Bob's reply got me wondering. 
  Before leaving CO, I'd taken a look _at_ my Vanagon manual, oil types chart.  
Because of the wide temp range, I opted for 20W50 for the trip out.  I have 
a list of about 5 things, so far, that might have contributed to the hole in 
my head (# 3 cylinder, not mine...yet).  I wonder, might this be an 
additional item?

What grade oil is ideal for a trip from Florida to Colorado?  Upon arrival, 
is 10W30 good for Rocky Mountainous area (w/plenty of mountain driving)?

Thanks,

Mark
