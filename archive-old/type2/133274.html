the coils' condition even before you started was an unknown so you have no
idea if any damagae was done (I'm surprised it started)

in any case, grab a known working coil, swap it in (get wires or correct
terminals) and see if the bus runs any better,  I would highly suspect
that the problem is not with the coil but in an engine that hasn't run for
years there are so many things that could be the glitch...

good luck
