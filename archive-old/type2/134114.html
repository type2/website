Thanks for all of the information about space heaters. Much appreciated.

On Jamie Rivers recommendation, I went to look at the Caframo 9200.
Some of the heaters I had looked at at Wal-Mart seemed just a bit on
the shoddy side. The Caframo is very well put together, and it also has
a five year warranty. I liked its low center of gravity. I also liked
the fact that the exterior case does not get hot... which hopefully
will prevent it from igniting our dog in the middle of the night. It
was $49.00 at Boat USA. A bit more expensive than the Wal-Mart models,
but probably those didn't have five year warranties.
