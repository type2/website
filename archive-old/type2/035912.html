Subject: Pacific Northwest events.

Volks,
  The latest events post from those that know and arrange them
are up at my site on the events board.
  Maybe when I get time I will pull the specifics and post them
but untill then you can check out the raw data yourself.
  BTW this covers events in Oregon/Washington state(s)...

                    Keep the shiney side up!
