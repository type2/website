--Dave and all,

Yes, this flaming is tiresome. We must remember holidays bring stress, as cliche and lame as that statement is. Let's chillout and talk some buses, and if somebody goes off, lets come back with dignity and self respect like Mark did.

I agree with Dave's appraisal of Dr. Tim's statement as well.

Mark,

I agree, even my Dad would never do such a thing.  I think everyone on
both vw lists I am on is getting stressed (full moon?).

What Tim is trying to say, is that everyday he deals with people that want their cars fixed cheap and he has learned over the years...
