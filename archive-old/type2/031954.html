&gt; I could not find any clutch slave cylinder mounted on the left side of

Well, check again now that you've go that big hole where the engine used 
to go.  The slave cylinder actually sits on the top left side of the 
transmission.  Look at the throwout bearing and its fork and follow the 
mechanism out of the bellhousing and up to the cylinder.  It's always 
good to know where these things are... :-)

&gt; Question?
&gt; 	Should I drop the tranny--since everything bolted onto it
&gt; is already removed--bolt the two together and reinstall that way?  I am
&gt; leaning towards this because it sounds impossible the other way.  I pulled
&gt; it by myself today but I could probably arrange to have someone help me
&gt; get it back in.

It's always good to have a friend to help... possibly one of the best 
&quot;tools&quot; you can have!  :-)  I don't really think there's any point in 
dropping the tranny now.  Carefully slide the engine back in, taking care 
that everything is properly lined up and &quot;square.&quot;  If you have a nice 
level work area putting an engine back in without the trans attached is 
not that big of deal.
