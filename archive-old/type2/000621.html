Subject: Busted bus

Hi volks.   Sorry but I have to go public and bring in front of this
community a problem that might cause a separation btw.Fifina ('76 Bus F.I
with A.T) and I.  She got me 5 years ago (love at the first sight) when I
did a small job for P.O. and because he was having difficulties keeping his
dr.license current (eyesight problems) I was able to persuade him to sell
the bus to me (82K. by orig. owner, 75years  old at that time). I took her
home and we had a wonderful relationship until 4 days ago when she quit on
me- we left our place to do some errands and after 500yards the engine
stopped.  I was doing 20mi/h and I did not hear any special noise but only
some hesitation/low vibration.  After failing to start her again I brought
her home where I noticed  1/ the engine is frozen  2/ the transmission -
when  any position is selected is like N , the car can be moved very easy
back and forth.    Questions: 1/possible cause  2/if I drop the engine, what
is minimum work for a bus with 125k .
I appreciate any suggestion before looking for counseling.
