&gt; What I would like to know from you guys is:
&gt; 
&gt; Is it very beneficial to full flow the 2.0 case?
&gt; Who makes a good oil pump for the 2.0 case?
&gt; Is it a good idea to use an oil sump on a 2.0 case?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for any info,

Harry:
1. Not necesssary! VW already did it for you (it does have an oil
filter, right?)
2. Stock VW one is fine for anything on the street. Bore and stroke to
2.7 and autocross it, you might need more.
3. I don't think anyone makes one.
