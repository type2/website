Subject: HYD Lifter Noise???
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Hi All - 

I'm getting ready to diagnose a noise on my '79 Westy w/ HYD lifters.  The
noise is always there but gets super quiet at high RPMs.  I completely rebuilt
the engine last summer and it ran great for 2000 miles and then I slightly
overheated it and the noise started.

Constant noise, most mechanics tell me it sounds like it has something to do
with my lifters - the lifters are brand new, after I overheated!  Can a new
lifter stick in the bore in which it rides?  I've heard the bores can get oil
glazed.  They are all adjusted properly and all seem to be pumping up ok -
they sure all aren't noisy - just a single loud knocking.

The lifters are a bit hard to take out - but I figured it was just some type
of air lock.

Can a rod make a constant noise?  What else can make a constant noise under
all loads and gets quieter at higher RPMs?  Could I be dropping a valve seat.

Too many questions I know ---

Thanks - 
Eric Miller
