&gt; &gt;the garage and a toolbox sits in it's place. MUCH more use for the tools.

&gt; Hmm.  None of the literature I've seen (sales, parts list, camper owner's
&gt; supplement) mention a real fridge.  Is the bus that the fridge came out of
&gt; a Westy or another conversion?  Maybe it was a dealer option.  I guess my
&gt; views are the same as yours:  a little jealous but not much.  (MY toolbox is
&gt; under the rear-facing seat.  :-) )

Westy conversion. Can't figure out anything BUT an option. 8) Joe
