I agree, and drive the same, but...VW advertised that you could drive it 
floored all day long without harm. Of course, that was a brand new vehicle 
with everything sealed up airtight. However, IMHO as a humble bus pilot, our 
35 year old vehicles need a bit more babying...I have all the tin  and 
cooling parts on my engine, and I still baby it. Engines cost too much to 
drive unto meltdown/valve seat failure/big oil puke. I tried carabussing on 
a long highway drive with type 4 engined buses in a hurry and failed, it was 
too hard on my engine trying to keep up. I want to find my bus's comfort 
zone, where it's not being pushed to 100% of it's endurance. I never floor 
it other than momentarily.

70 High Roof




&lt;I would never drive my '71 for four solid minutes with the pedal floored 
under
any circumstances.  Not enough cooling to compensate.  If I did that and my
engine melted down, I'd call it &quot;driver error.&quot;  If I need the pedal floored
to maintain speed and the hill will last longer than about 20-30 seconds, I
downshift into 3rd and slow to 40.
