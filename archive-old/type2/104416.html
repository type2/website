Subject: Re: [T2] Lack of Confidence in Van

Maybe it is time to buy something late model and domestic. I've never been 
stranded by our van but prepare for anything I can fix on the road with 
spares, books, tools, and my experience. I don't carry spare crankshafts 
because I can't replace it on the road (easily). &lt;grin&gt; I keep a spare 
dizzy, spare EFI system (brain and sensors and injectors), a couple fan 
belts, a bit of oil, and tools.
