Thanks, people.

I found another person local (Baltimore) who wants the extra fuel filler 
neck.  Good old Bob 'what's_his_name'.

H Steven Dolan was kind enough to take a few pictures of the item in 
question, so if some of the list members are not quite sure what we are all 
talking about, have a look at . . .

(Steven, this is all I wanted to do with the pictures.  Could you pull them 
down next week??)

When we stripped the '77 bus earlier this year,  I pulled the fuel filler 
neck out/off.  It is dry and brittle, and could not be used as a 
replacement.  I was hoping to get a good one off to use as a model for a 
mold, but it wasn't solid enough for even that.

With that experience, I fully expect that if I ever need a replacement, I 
will not be able to find one in the junk yard at all.  So I went and bought 
a future replacement to stash in my parts bin.

For those of you with pre-74 problems, keep searching and keep your eyes 
open.

And good luck.
