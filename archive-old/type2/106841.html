Subject: engine rebuild observations

Hey list, I just started tearing into my 2.0L GE engine last nite.  When I 
purchased my westy the engine ran but had severe blow-by.  What I found 
when I started tearing it down was:  severe catastrophic breakage of the 
oil scraper ring on number 3.  The bits of the oil scraper ring had lodged 
into the grooves for the 2 compression rings.  Also, the oil scraper rings 
on the other three cylinders had all compacted down into their grooves and 
were obviously not scraping any oil.  I'm surprised this engine ran at all 
but it did run and on all four cylinders to boot!  My question to the list 
is:  what might have caused the oil scraper rings to all shrink down into 
their respective grooves.  You may recall that this is the engine that had 
half of the cooling tin missing (I may have just answered my own 
question!  TIA ,  g
