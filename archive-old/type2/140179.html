Subject: Re: [T2] electric fuel pumps

Hi Kevin,

I'm not sure why you're having so much bad luck with electric pumps. I have
a '73 Bay 1700 with dual weber ICT carbs, and I've been using the same
electric pump (Facet) for about 10 years. I also use a Bugpack fuel
regulator set to 3 PSI and have an on/off switch for the pump up front by
the driver's seat, so I can have the key on if I need to do some electrical
and the pump off so as not to flood the motor - also works as a cheap
security device - no fuel - car don't go (or not far, anyways). It runs
great, doesn't run on when you turn it off, and passes the yearly emissions
test. Maybe it's how you wired it (poor ground), or fuel line size (too
small= pump working to hard?), or maybe there's crap in your fuel line from
the tank that's slowing down or blocking your pump - do you change your fuel
filter every year? Have you checked your tank? Just some ideas.

Before I do, does anyone have any suggestions.  I'm

fine with an electric fuel pump as long as it works.

But this is the fourth one in 6 years (counting the

original and the Puralator that still works).  Can

anyone explain why it runs better with a Cardone?
