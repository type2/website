&gt; &gt; OK Volks, I need a quick answer?  I'm needing a steering knuckle and tie rod

&gt; almost positive they changed in 72/73 so they would not be directly
&gt; interchangeable,

You can use these parts on a '71, but you have to swap the spindle,
caliper, hub, and rotor as a set.  You get longer-lasting (but not
stronger) brakes in the bargain.
