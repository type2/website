Subject: Ques about KYB shock length??
Message-ID: &lt;372D044C.4E61_at_ibm_dot_net&gt;

Hey all,
one thing after another

I've reset the torsion bars, replaced the brake hoses, new wheel
cylinders and brake hardware/shoes/hand brake cables/ refurbished
backing plates
new inner/outer wheel bearings
re-doing lots

I was just putting on the new KYB shocks i purchased and I have hit
another snag

With the bus up on jack stands, the spring plate is resting on it's
shelf
Regardless of the torsion bar re-setting, the distance from the lower
shock mount to the upper shock mount should be fixed (except for slight
deviations when re-assembling the wheel housing/spring plate. 

The new KYB shock will not reach the upper mount!

The easy answer is to take it off the jack stand and then mount the
shock.  But, the next time the bus is jacked up, the force of the
torsion arm will be on the shock instead of the shelf.  Seems like this
would rupture the shock????

Here's the data:
KYB shock extende= 22.5&quot; oc mounting hole to mounting hole
Bus shock mounting holes - 22.5&quot; oc w/ spring plate on it's shelf

I checked the old cheap piece of junk shock that was in the bus and it
will fit both mounting holes

sooo, Any others w/ this experience?
Will the KYB rupture if the force of the torsion bar is exerted on it -
or will it give .5&quot;??

Thanks
Michael
