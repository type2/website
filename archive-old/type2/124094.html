Subject: Sliding Door Hinge

The sliding door hinge (U shaped arm) has square posts on each end.  Thus,
when installing you have to choose one of four possible initial orientations
or mounting positions.  One end mounts in a pivot cam attached to a spring
bolted to the door, the other to a pivot cam on top of the mechanism with the
roller and guide piece.
I need to know in what position the arm and the cam should be before
installing the door.  Can anyone who happens to have or is willing to take
their door off take a picture of what yours looks like?  Mine is a 76.  Here
is a picture of what I need.
I'm assuming the more left it is the more spring tension you'll get to kick
the door out when open but I don't want to put it under too much strain when
closed and straightened out.  I'm thinking it probably needs to be one
position right from where I have it but am only guessing without a reference.
I have no idea which way the cam goes but its position should probably be
stated relative to the arm, e.g. the fat part of the lobe faces the arm, etc.
Alas, a picture is worth a thousand words... :-)
Thanks!
Mike
