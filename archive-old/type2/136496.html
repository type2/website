&gt; I remember very clearly meeting you and that bus in Opal VA, on the way
&gt; to Everybus 2001. It was midway through the third day of my first long
&gt; bus trip, and our carabus caught up with you and Sean Bartnik.
&gt; Following your splitty through VA and into NC was a very memorable
&gt; experience.

Greg,

It was indeed! :-)  Altho the bus performed much better than I expected,
in that I never had to crawl under it.  Certain other buses in the caravan
did worse, to my chagrin.  I was *hoping* to win the &quot;rusty bus&quot; award,
but the poor fellow whose relay arm fell off won instead (and he deserved
it!)

&gt; Hopefully I will see it at EveryBus 2005 with a better interior than it
&gt; had in 2001:

err... probably not :-)  Remember, the bus went down stripped-out to ease
Kelly's and Mark's work.  The interior is in my basement and will remain
there until it is back here.  While it will be far better looking when I
get ir back, it will still be an empty drum, both from a camping and
sleeping perspective.  That's both bad and good.  For camping and driving,
not so hot, but both Mark and Kelly will have their work on display for
one and all to inspect.  I am proud of what both did/are doing and really
want to afford them this opportunity.

&gt;
&gt; Yes, that is daylight coming through the D/S door well.  Now that
&gt; Kelly's done with it, it'll certainly be a lot less drafty!

Greg,

I got a blank page here (tho I remember the drafts quite well :-)
