Subject: Re: [T2] John vs Mario

I wish you two could keep your pissin match off the list.I had to stop
reading r.a.m.v.a for a while cause it got so bad.Bus people are usually
pretty nice so lets try to keep it that way.Just for the record John
everyone allready heard enough about Mario to make up there own mind about
wheter they want to do business with him,and your good record as a parts
vendor speaks for itself.I personally have no desire to read more about it.

On a more on topic note Im gonna bring my bus into B&amp;C in freeburg Mo and
let Mike fix my windshield rust.
                                         By the way Im also John C only in
MO.
