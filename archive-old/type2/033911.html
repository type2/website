Subject: snowwwwwwwwwwwwww!----and welding grounds

eeek, it has finally hit.  snow, and a lot of it.
it was the slipperiest stuff I've ever been in...so while I was on break
at work...I couldn't resist... I had to go burn around in my bus in the
stuff...
wow! the bus really slides!  spinning tires is not a problem, and I can
act cool now that I can spin my tires...hehe ;-)
lotsa fun..._dot_despite the fact I may be driving my bus throughout the
winter.... :( oh well... I'll just keep washing her undersides to keep
the salt off.  would mudflaps be reccomended? I only have 1 on right
now....as the others have cracked off.

that and welding.  I tried to weld up some small holes in my front
floorboard...but it would be really jumpy and bird-terd ish because I
could not find a good ground to clamp on to.  what do you guys use for a
ground??

thanks
Isaiah
