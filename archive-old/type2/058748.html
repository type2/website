Subject: 70 Bus FS Parts or whole

Hello All

I need to get some space now for my 72 westy.  So it's time
to really try to get rid on the old bus.

I have a 70 bus.  Body in good shape.  No engine/tranny.
Seats all good, including both 2/3 and a full length middle
seat, only one is in the bus.
Rear seat is one of the ones that fold out a bed, orange
plaid.  In good shape.
All glass is good including a louver side window.
Interior is clean and in good shape.

I'd like to sell it whole for $500 OBO but  as it needs to
go I'll part it out.  I have already had people wanting to
cut parts out of it.  It would be ashame to cut this bus
up.  It's body is in good shape.  But is need to go.

If you need parts let me know and we can work something
out.  I'll keep a list of who wants what for a week or so,
if it isn't sold whole buy then I'll start stripping.

BTW  I live in Annapolis, MD

Brent
