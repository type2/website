Subject: Resurrecting a 1972 Westy (From the viewpoint of a rookie)

I recently purchased a 1972 Bus. It's engine had been replaced, transmission rebuilt, and then through a circuitous process, sat idle for 2 years before I came across it. 

I have never done a restoration, much less worked on air-cooled. Here is the root of the problem I am facing now.

I have read all of the advice here about starting issues, and followed the advice posted. I have gone from nothing, to ALMOST turning the motor over! I replaced ignition switch and lock (no keys when I bought it) starter (and bushing), battery, both main battery cables, and installed a &quot;hard start&quot; relay near the starter. Since the bus had been sitting so long I removed the spark plugs and put about a teaspoon of 5w-30 in each cylinder and?removed the generator belt. The spark plugs had never been fired, the oil is clean and clear and at the proper level. I rotated the fan, and it moved all the way around, but VERY grudgingly. All of this has incrementally taken me from nothing, to a solenoid click, to what sounds like a machine gun going off from the starter, but still no rotation.?I am assuming (I am starting to realize assumptions are foolish when dealing with these things) that this is due to the difficulty in manually turning.

I need recommendations on how to lessen the?mechanical resistance to turning?over, keeping?in mind, everything is clean and clear, but it sat for so long. 

This will be the first of, I'm sure many posts that gradually will become more educated. I have already learned much from reading all of the posts here.

Chris
