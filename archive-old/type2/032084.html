Just for the record, I love the Bus Depot too. I've done business with
them on 5 occasions and each time they've given me incredible value on
good quality VW parts. The website rocks. Their people, in my experience,
work very hard and are very helpful. It's a little hard to get through on
the phone sometimes, and it took all of 48 hours to get an e-mail response
to a question once, but it's a lean business and that's why their prices
are so good. Parts arrive drop shipped from all over the place and I'm
frankly amazed at the logistics behind the business. You guys rock!

Keep up the good work, Ron!
