&gt;Okay, one more...
&gt;I've just installed a new engine perimeter seal, the flat kind with double

&gt;of the engine apron (or whatever you call the body piece it attaches to).
&gt;The bunching up leads to gaps large enough to stick several fingers
&gt;through. Not a good situation for sealing. Am I doing something wrong?
&gt;Bob

It's possible.  Let's see if it was installed correctly:

The Engine Surround Seal on 56-71 Buses is the same as those used on the
45-66 Beetles and K Ghias.  Installation on a Bus/Pickup is a little
different than on the Type 1 by doing the following:

Notice that the seal is shaped like a &quot;U&quot;.  Remove the Rear Apron.  Slide
one side of the &quot;U&quot; into the slot on the body on the LEFT side of the
Engine.  Be sure that the double flap of the seal has one flap on top of
the Engine Tin and one flap below the Engine Tin.  At the end of the slot
on the body, take a sharp knife or tin snips and cut the seal.  Now take
the opposite side of what's left of the &quot;U&quot; seal and repeat the process on
the right side of the engine.

What's left over now is a &quot;C&quot; shaped piece that installs into the slot on
the Rear Apron.  When installing this piece, be sure that it is not
&quot;bunched&quot; by forcing all of the rubber into the slot.  If the seal is
completely in the slot and there is &quot;bunching&quot;, pull both ends of the
exposed seal to reduce or eliminate the bunching.  Do not stretch the seal
or in time (and heat), the seal will prematurely deteriorate and you'll
haveta replace the darn thing again.  Trim any excess seal left over on the
ends, but leave enough to overlap the two pieces it mates up to on the left
and right side of the engine.  Be sure that when you re-install the apron
the upper flap goes on top of the Engine Tin and the lower flap below it.

If bunching persists, you may have gotten a poorly made Brazilian Engine
Surround Seal and I've never been able to get them to work right.  Use a
good quality OEM or better yet a USA Made seal like mine or WCM's.

BONUS ODDBALL PART - For those who have read this far.  Once again, I've
turned up something in my travels into the &quot;Black Hole&quot; of my warehouse
that is related to this.  A long, long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away,
I purchased what I thought were a whole bunch of OEM Engine Surround Seals.
 Turns out these were the Replacement Engine Surround Seal which attached
to the Rear Apron ONLY of the 56-71 Bus and originally sold as 211-813-705.
 These were made and sold at a time when VW was more thoughtful about
replacing just the Apron Seal if it happened to be damaged during engine
replacement or just routine maintenance involving just the removal of the
apron, rather than requiring a Beetle numbered &quot;Universal&quot; type seal you
had to cut to make it work.  I've got about 30 or 40 of these, so if you
need to replace just the seal on the Rear Apron only, I'm getting $3.00
each - order PN 211-8151.  These are OE VW, not aftermarket or Brazil.
