Subject: RE: [T2] luggage rack seal fit

&gt; I bought the Westyrubber kit from Bus Depot. The poptop seal is really
good. I compared it to a
&gt; seal sold by another vendor and the neoprene bulb is a unique location
on the BD seal just as Ron 
&gt; has said. Kudos.  The flat seal is also a very good fit... My only
complaint is with the luggage rack seal.
&gt; I have a lot more air coming into the bus which isn't a bad thing but
the extra noise is bothersome.

&gt; I have this problem as well. I initally had no seal on my 78's luggage
rack. I put the seal on and the 
&gt; noise stopped. Then I replaced the rack when I replaced the whole pop
top and just transferred 
&gt; the seal.  The noise came back. I am going to try and loosen the
screws that hold the rack to the 
&gt; bus and try to adjust it closer to the roof

&gt; I don't think its a seal issue as much as a luggage rack issue.
Idon't think my new rack sits as close
&gt; to the roof as the old one did. Probably needs adjusting. The trick
here is that the seal has to allow water
&gt; to drain, but needs to fit tight enough to keep the rack from
vibrating.

&gt; I'd like to hear from Ron's opinion.



My long-winded take on the subject is that Theodore hit the nail right
on the head.

If you look at the original seal, it does not have an insulation bulb
like the aftermarket poptop seals have. It has a small lip off of one
edge and that's it. And if you look at the luggage rack itself, you see
that there are holes in the top of the rack, for rain to go into. This
is why the stock seal had no bulb! The rain is supposed to drain into
the rain gutters on the roof - a process that is impossible if you used
a bulbed seal for the luggage rack, which seals the exit point. While
the rain will no doubt seep around the seal eventually, it will take
much longer, and meanwhile will collect on the roof of your bus, under
the luggage rack.

So, we can say that a bulbed seal is not optimal for the luggage rack
from a drainage standpoint.  Is a non-bulbed seal optimal?  Well, it's
sure easier to install, because it can easily be installed without
removing or loosening the luggage rack (something that cannot be said
about a bulbed seal).  And it will not interfere with rainwater
drainagw. So, as long as it does not cause wind noise and vibration,
yes, it is optimal.  And in over 99% of cases, it meets those criteria. 

Bear in mind that while we've heard from a couple of people who
experienced wind noise or vibration while using a non-bulbed seal, this
is a tiny drop in the bucket compared to the number of people who have
not experienced any problems. Poptop seals are one of my most popular
products. We ship maybe 5-10 a day. That's a 1000+ a year (many of them
to listmembers). Out of which we have, what, two or three listmember
reports of wind noise or vibration?  So we can say that the incidence of
negative effects is extremely rare.  Personally, I have had non-bulbed
seals on my last three Westies and never had any noise or vibration
whatsoever (as have thousands of other people). Therefore, for the vast
majority of users, a non-bulbed seal is the best, cheapest, and simplest
choice. It's the easiest to install and promotes proper drainage,
without any negative side effects.

How about the less-than-1% who do experience wind noise or vibration? I
am convinced that this is because the luggage rack itself is just a tad
loose, allowing air to get underneath the luggage rack seal, as Theodore
has surmised. Their prior seal most likely either had a tiny lip (if it
was original VW) or a bulb (if it was generic aftermarket), and putting
on a non-bulbed seal widened the gap just enough to let some wind in.
This probably would not have been the case if the luggage rack were
removed to install the seal and then retightened. But since the
non-bulbed seals don't require this, it was not done.

In some cases, slightly repositioning the luggage rack seal will fill
this gap and solve the problem.  If it doesn't, tightening the luggage
rack toward the body may. If both fail, you could always do what the
person in the Samba post that Richard cited did, which was to put a
short length of black foam (or something similar) between the seal and
the roof, on the front edge of the poptop. 

There is another solution. I do also sell a version of the luggage rack
seal that HAS the insulation bulb - my part number LUGSEAL2.  If you're
uninclined to try a bulbless seal, or if you try one and get wind noise,
order that one instead. I would second Richard's suggestion that you cut
a few holes in the bulb toward the rear of each side of the luggage rack
to allow drainage.  

Why don't I just ship that version every time instead? Well, even if you
modify it to improve drainage, it's still much more difficult to install
without loosening/removing the luggage rack, and it's slightly more
expensive. So there are a few negatives, just to solve a wind noise
problem that occurs less than 1% of the time (and even in those cases
can often be easily solved anyway). Hence my decision to offer the
bulbless seal as &quot;standard&quot; and the bulbed one as &quot;optional.&quot;  My advice
was, and remains, to buy the non-bulbed seal.  Worst-case is you'll have
to spend a few bucks to replace it with a bulbed one because it caused
wind noise and the easy mods didn't solve it. But given that your
chances of this happening are a maybe 1/2 of 1%, it's not much of a
risk. And assuming that it works, as it does for most people, it sure is
easier to install. 

On a related note, we have now received from Europe another shipment of
our exclusive flat seals (the ones that go between the poptop and
luggage rack). These have aluminum clips, so they don't require gluing.
We can't always get this version, but when we can, we sell it for the
same price as the ones that do require gluing. Nobody else has these but
us.
