&gt; I looked into the fitting of a later steering box into an early bay, since

The &quot;frame&quot; is a box of sheet metal.  The holes for the steering boxes
have tubes around the through-bolts welded to the sheet metal to carry the
compression loads of the bolts.  Not difficult, but harder than a &quot;drill
and fit&quot; process.

Still, if it can be done, it should!  I don't hear of many worm-and-roller
boxes failing.
