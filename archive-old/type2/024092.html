Subject: ignition switch?
Message-ID: &lt;74017a71.24b2c5e5_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Was set to go camping this weekend. Started Babcia, backed out to move her 
over to the house for packing and she died after she ran about 20 seconds. 
Would not restart. Felt electrical so changed (one at a time) cap, rotor, 
coil, points. Nada.

Felow listee Chris Slaymaker (Nurofiz) suggested a hot wire to the coil and 
it started right up, but the horn blared constantly. Figure it is the 
ignition switch. Any way to tell for sure? I am electricly impared. Anyway, 
the Bently says remove the steering wheel etc. but is a bit skechy on the 
68-69 model. Is this needed? I hope not. I have a 1969 parter in the yard. It 
has no key, am I out of luck?

Sir Bently mentions removing the horn wire in the procedure, so I assume the 
horn going off is normal? ? ?  To many gremlins to worry about just before 
the trip so had to take wifey's car and my napper motorcycle camper. Bummer. 

Felt so sad sitting there busless, while Chris got all the complements on his 
with the bright shiney new nose. It was not a VW camp, but everyone loves a 
bus. Too much food, beer and sun, and am paying for it today.

Thanks in advance for any input.
