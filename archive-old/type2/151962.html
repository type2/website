&gt; Doing my first type 4 pull and replant this weekend.  I've pulled/installed

THE type 4 engine is a LOT heavier...and it is a tighter fit getting it in
and out.   some folks do the pull with the tranny lowered some.

&gt; I gave my Bentley to a needy youth earlier, so will not have that, but I will
&gt; check archives for already posted &quot;lists&quot;.

buy another.

don't forget to remove the coil and oil filler.....they won't clear.

good luck
