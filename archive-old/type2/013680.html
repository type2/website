&gt;&gt;Well, I have the rears at 60, the friont at 50. The tires are rated at
1710 lbs at 65 PSI; I know VW suggested that the tires be inflated to 40
and below, but those were passenger tires.&lt;&lt;

huh? i dont think buses came with passenger tires from the factory.
(someone will correct me if i am wrong)

for safety's sake, ALWAYS follow the vehicle's tire type &amp; pressure, which
usually be found on a placard inside the door jamb. of course you can also
find that info in Bentley or any owner's manual.

i'm not sure if overinflated tires could be the cause of your still-wandering
suspension, but how about setting the tire pressure to exactly what VW
did from the factory &amp; then take your bus out for a drive???...

HTH.
