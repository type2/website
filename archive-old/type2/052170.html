Subject: [T2] RE: Push Rod Tube Removal

[...]  Here's a tip to help prevent leaking push rod tube seals.  Before you
install the push rod tubes, take a moment to pull apart the accordian ends
on each one.  This effectively makes the tubes a bit longer.  Then when you
tighten your heads down they will crush back to exactly the right length.
I've never had a leaking tube since I started doing this.

&gt; No Quarter sends:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; You do NOT have to pull the heads on a T1 engine to remove the pushrod
&gt; &gt; tubes.  To put new STOCK ones on you do.  But you can remove the valve
&gt; &gt; cover, rocker shaft, and pushrods then take the pliers and proceed to
&gt; &gt; destroy your existing tubes to get them out.  You'll be forced to
&gt; replace
&gt; &gt; them with spring loaded or double-nut tubes if you aren't going to pull
&gt; &gt; the head which are inferior to the stock tubes but will work in a pinch.
&gt; 
&gt; The best T1 pushrod tubes on the market, IMO, are the 4340 seamless
&gt; chromoly
&gt; tube. They cost $4 each and they aren't collapsible. They also won't leak
&gt; unless you drill holes in them.
