Just finished reading the account of John Anderson and Steve Dolan installing a
1980 vanagon case into a 1973 bus with 1978 heads.  John mentioned that the combatability
issues regarding the oil breather and oil filler hole are minor, with the main thing being to use
the bay window support and support brackets, but first boring out the holes in the bay window
support brackets to accomodate the larger bolts found on the post-79 case. Okay, so far so good.
Because my access to this list doesn't let me see actually e-mail addresses, I must post in hopes
they will see and respond.

question:  Did you use the 1973 or the 1980 alternator/shroud set-up?
                    Was the final motor hydraulic/fuel injected? Was computer compatability an issue?
         One year later, how is that motor permutation doing? Is it a stopgap, or is it a viable motor?

Thanks much
C. Sheridan
