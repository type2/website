&gt; I'll try to use my local FLAPS first, because they're here and it's
&gt; easier to solve problems when they arise.

--&gt; Count your blessings!  Some of us aren't so lucky...the only auto
parts stores around here are the national chains.  Sometimes I can get
small stuff from them, like points, if I help them look it up.  (&quot;Yes,
'1977 Transporter' sounds like the right computer entry.  Yes, I know I
said it's a 'van', but use that one anyway.&quot;  One of the places has it in
their computer as a '1977 Vanagon', which is rather confusing.)  I also
found it saves time to tell them it's a 1977 if I need an engine part, a
1975 otherwise, instead of trying to explain that my 1975 van has a '77
engine.
