&lt;Actually slowed down involuntarily and put it in 3rd when I was
down low enough. Engine performed well again and had no
problems even in 4th the rest of the way to the gas
station to put a few $ in.&gt;

Could be rust particles clogging the filter, or the carb jet.  That's what
it turned out to be for me under very similar circumstances.  I more or less
confirmed it by getting one of those disassembleable pyrex glass tube
filters.  Easy to see the condition of the gas just before it hit the carb.
