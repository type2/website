Subject: RE: [T2] Road Trip

15 days is plenty.  We made it from NC to CA in three days but we were
pegged at 75mph for the whole trip and it wasn't that comfortable.  We have
taken both 80 and 40 cross country in the bus and depending on weather and
the location you are going to in CA, 40 is a bit of an easier drive.  IIRC
the grades on 40 were not quite as bad either.  On 80 you'll need to survive
the 10k foot pass in Wyoming while going over the Rockies and Donner summit
near Tahoe can be rough as well.  Especially during this time of year.  Of
course, all of this is assuming that you are willing to hop on an
interstate.

Any route suggestions (Mass to Cali)?  And how long did your trip take?  Is
15
days too little time?
