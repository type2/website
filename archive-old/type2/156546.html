&gt; it snapped off. the little nut now has part of the
&gt; strainer bolt inside 
&gt; of it, and im guessing its never coming out.
&gt; 
&gt; so, I need to replace that nut and the bolt that
&gt; sticks down for the 
&gt; strainer to attach to.
&gt; &lt;SNIP&gt;
I'm sorry my memory isn't more perfect, as it's been
several years since I've done a similar stunt... It
seems to me, though, that the nut attaches to a stud
that you should be able to grab with vice grips and
simply unscrew. Replace it with a new stud, put a drop
of Loctite on the upper part before installing, let it
set if you have that luxury of time, then reassemble
using four hundred lb/feet of torque this time ;o). I
hope I'm right cuz I think it's an easy fix! -BaH
