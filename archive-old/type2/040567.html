considering it's still Friday

possibly a law suit since this &quot;could&quot; be considered discrimination in
Public accomodation (I'm not a lawyer)

&gt; considering that my encounters with Thom have been universally negative,

being &quot;universally negative&quot; or even an SOB is NOT illegal. 

&gt; I doubt very seriously that Thom is the victim here. I'm sure Larry had
&gt; a d_at_mn good reason for his action.

will it stand up in court???

&gt; I applaud Larry for having to courage to stand up to a bully.

he can stand up all he wants' but if it is a &quot;PUBLIC&quot; function he has to
allow any person who does not &quot;pose a direct threat to the health or
safety of others&quot; equal access and benifit of that Public function.  this
is a direct quote from federal civil rights law

I don't know any of the participants BUT I can not stomach discrimanatory
treatment of any kind
