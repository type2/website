&gt;Hello List
&gt;Since I'm new you might not remember me asking about a 72 Westy we might
&gt;get, no luck yet but where still hopping. Any how I saw a post last night
&gt;where someone mentioned it took about two hours to drop a 72 up engine and 4
&gt;to put back in. &quot;sorry for not getting your name before I deleted your mail&quot;
&gt;So I was wondering is this typical? 

That would have been me. I don't know what's typical with the post-71
engines, as this is my first bus with the Type 4 engine. I also can pull
the earlier engines in 20-30 minutes...and install in slightly more.

I have a 2.0 liter on a '72 tranny (with a '77 bellhousing). This combo was
appropriate, but makes my engine about 1/2&quot; longer, which means that it's
just as easy for me to pull the engine/tranny combo as to pull the engine
by itself. This of course means that I have to remove the tranny-to-wheel
arms, the overhead tranny mount, and the rear engine mount. The part that's
really time consuming to me is juggling my jack and Ken's jack (which I
usually borrow for pulls) between jobs; and then jacking up the bus to pull
the engine from underneath. The latter may be the most significant
difference. If not for the redesign which left the rear apron off between
'71 and '72, there would be little change in the engine pull procedure.

On my old '64, I could pull the engine, fix something and have it back in
before I had to go to work in the morning. On the '72, anything requiring
an engine pull takes at least a Saturday, and often an entire weekend or more.

That said, the '72 will pull hills at 70+ MPH...the same hills that the '64
could take at 50 and slowing.

Thanks! Joe
