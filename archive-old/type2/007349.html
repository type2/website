Well, first off that air isn't &quot;hot&quot; until it's allowed to pass down and around the j-tubes inside the heater boxes, on it's way to the cab. Maybe people remove the fresh air hose and block the holes in the fan housing. This forces all the air sucked in by the fan down onto the heads, theoretically it should help cool the heads, but if you have an engine running too hot it won't solve the problem causing the hot engine.
