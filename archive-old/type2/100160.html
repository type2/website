Subject: Accessory Vespa for Bus

Hi All.

While at Busses by the Buoy in Maine (Always a must attend event for me),
some one had a small motor scooter in their bus for putting around the
campsite. Well, it got me thinking, which is always a risky proposition. My
wife won't let me buy any more VW's, but a scooter doesn't take up much
room, and it would be great to tow behind my Bus for exploring once camped
in an area. Anyone know any for sale in New England? Please p-mail me.

Thanks

Jeff
