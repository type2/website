Subject: top dead center at 12oClock on an 81 westy

Hi there, I checked with the dowel on #1 cylinder where top dead center really
is on my 2 litre engine that's been rebuilt (PO).  It's at 12 o Clock straight
up.  No where near the 0 mark on the scale.

Is this common in rebuilt engines?  Maybe they used some other kind of crank
or something?

I have the same Calif version distrib that's described in the bentley (part
#), so I timed accordingly at 5ATDC from the 12 o Clock position, the real TDC
of motor (disregarding scale) and it runs nicely now.

Thanks for previous help!

Brad
