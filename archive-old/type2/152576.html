Subject: Re: [T2] Poptop Wood Frame Repairs

I have some roof problems with my 72 sportsmobile...In my case, it
looks like the PO may have put a couple extra bolts thru the roof, and
over time water got in and rotted a little of the roof innards. I
think I caught it in time.

 Kind of related... I wonder if anyone has a good picture of how their
&quot;pop-up mechanism&quot; connects to their sportsmobile pop-top?
(specifically, I'm talking about the the metal frame right as you come
in thru the sliding door.)

 The canvas on mine was in pretty bad shape, so I bit the bullet and
pulled it all down. I'm going to use the original canvas as a template
(I can provide measurements if anyone else needs them). Boat people
seem to have some good thoughts on canvas selection
(http://www.boatus_dot_com/boattech/casey/22.htm)... I was planning on
sticking with some wood strips; The wood I pulled down was actually
very dry; Chris... I'm curious as to the source of the moisture in you
case..?
