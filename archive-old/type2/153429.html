Subject: Gas Tank Removal

Yah, I checked the archives.  :-)

Is there any special trick or way of turning or tilting the gas tank on a '79
in order to remove it?  The connections have be severed, tank is drained,
engine is out. I am taking a break before I end up damaging something.  (I
have enough work ahead of me.)

Also, if anyone has any sage advice or suggestions while I am in the engine
bay area of my restore I would greatly appreciate it.  (I am adding an access
port for the fuel sender as in the tech area of T2)  Anything that will make
future work etc more manageable, comfortable etc.

Thanks in advance.

PS. doing the gast tank resto as per ratwell instructions next week.
