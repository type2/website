&gt; I just obtained 4 Bus or Vanagon driveaway side tents from a supplier in

That looks very similar to the Andria tent that Steve Lashley is selling
for 350.00. 

 &gt;&gt;

It does look similar, but without a better image or more information on the 
materials used, I can't say mine is any better.

I have tents starting at $350.  I also have tents for $625, it all depends on 
the size, material and options.  I buy them by the truck load, not a couple 
at a time.

EuroCampers offers 4 different side tents, and we give listmember discounts, 
so the $350 tent will even cost you even less.

Also check out our Tourmobil tent, which we reduced the price on last week 
because of current good exchange rates.  The Tourmobil is designed like a 
dome tent and uses fiberglass poles.  It also packs very small and weighs 
about half of the standard bus tents.
