Subject: 1978 Westy &gt; $10,500 * NOT For Sale?  Hmmm...

Volks-

Not only is BartMan a bit crazy on his pricing, he also appears to be a
liar.  Looks like he is someone that everyone would probably want to
steer clear of in terms of any sort of VW business transaction.

Hope that this saves someone else from being ripped off or worse...
