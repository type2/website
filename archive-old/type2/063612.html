Subject: 77 Westy: Engine won't start when warm.

Greetings all,

My 1977 sage green Westy (fuel injected 2000cc type IV engine) has
just started having some engine problems.  It stalls at idle, hiccups
at full power, and won't start when the engine is warm (but starts
very quickly when the engine is cool).  These problems are very recent
and have progressed rapidly during the 1000 mile road trip I made
yesterday (Virginia to Florida).

It had run very well until about a week ago when it started
occasionally stalling at idle.  It would be idling fine, then drop
engine speed for part of a second, recover, then drop speed again and
die.  Revving the engine some at idle would keep this from happening.

During the trip yesterday, it would occasionally hiccup, loosing all
power for a fraction of a second.  This became more frequent,
happening up to once a minute toward the end of the trip.

After the next to last stop for gas the engine would not start.  It
would crank over rapidly, but not catch at all.  After about a 20
minute wait with the engine lid open it started right up.

After the last stop for gas I had the same problem.  I must not have
waited as long this time, for the engine was reluctant to start, and I
needed to give it gas to keep it alive at idle.


The engine is not overheating.  After a long run the dip stick is warm
but comfortable to hold tightly.  The points and rotor appear somewhat
pitted but not fried.  I will try replacing them and adjusting timing
and point gap, but first I wanted your advice.

I will be sailing in the islands for two weeks, but at the rate the
problem is progressing, don't think I could get home this way.  (I
suppose that whenever I am with my Westy I am at home, but I will need
to get back to my place of work.)


Thanks,

BTW, where is the EGR light reset switch?
