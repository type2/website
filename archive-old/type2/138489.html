Subject: [T2] Re: California testing

Antonio asked:

Do you know in what type of vehicle does the westy fall into?

Barry says:

The Westy is a Multipurpose Passenger Vehicle [MPV] because it is built on a 
truck chassis and is not capable of carrying more than 10 passengers.  It is 
NOT an MPV because it has been modified for off road usage...  See Federal 
definitions for MPV.  State definitions may/will vary

If you can convince California that it its NOT a passenger car, but a truck 
with LVW less than 3750 lbs (weight doesn't really matter in this exercise) 
and you have a 1974 VW LDT1 (Light Duty Truck), then you should be exempt 
from California inspections.
