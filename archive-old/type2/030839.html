Subject: Administrivia - Bad mail day!
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.LNX.3.91.981101221425.24657A-100000_at_bigkitty.azaccess_dot_com&gt;

It's been a long and really bad day, so I beg you, excuse me if this is 
pettier than I intend....

1) NEVER!  NEVER! NEVER!  post anything even vaguely resembling a list
command to the list!  On a daily basis I handle all sorts of problems for
all manner of listies and off-listies.  I am happy to do it.  No, no,
*really* :-) That's why I volunteered for the job!  *PLEASE* write me! 
Please *don't* write to the list!  If you have a problem with subscribing,
with unsubscribing, with posting, with switching from one list to another,
with not getting mail, or even with toilet training your dog, WRITE TO ME! 
don't write to the list!  My addresses are: 

dworkin_at_type2_dot_com
dworkin_at_ari_dot_net

Write them down.  On a sticky!  Put it on your monitor!!  *USE* them!!!!

2)  IBM PS-2's are not VW busses! However tempting it is to use the list 
to sell or give away non-bus stuff, please don't!

3) Turbodeisels are not busses, either.  Ratings of and problems with 
dealers, VW and otherwise, as they relate to busses are on topic and 
encouraged.  (on any other day this would have passed, David, but...) 
please, if the problem is with a dealership, but it's not a bus, a simple 
thumbs down will do.

3)  Bored as I sometimes get with tire threads, heater threads, and some 
of the other &quot;eternals&quot;, you have never seen me weigh in on one or shut 
one down.  Tires keep changing.  New models are introduced, old models 
die.  I used to be a religious Michelin XZX buyer, but am now searching 
the archives for a good replacement as Michelin has ceased production of 
this model :-((((((  

On whether things should or should not be added to the Type2 web page, the
proper place to go is to Ken Hooper.  Our esteemed listmeister, emeritus,
is still the man in charge of the web page. The split-up of the lists
leaves the following in charge of the following (lousy phrasing, lousy
language :-): 

Ken Hooper       -  Type2 Web page
Thom Fitzpatrick -  Vintagebus list (50-67 busses)
me               -  Type2 list (68-83 air cooled busses {also 83-&gt;, 
                    non-US, aircooled busses})

Sorry, all.  Bye and large, I am proud to be involved with the list.  I 
think y'all are doing a tremendous job of providing incredibly valuable 
information.  The list is focussed where it ought to be, on serving the 
Type 2 community and the questions and contributions are great!
