&quot;.....If you have a Bus dating from 68 to 71 VW has an in-house published
manual
just for you.  It sometimes lacks the detail of the other manuals but the
info is tailored to the early bays and the pictures are great.  Also it does
outline many procedures skipped by later manuals.....&quot;



Where can I get this manual?  If it is not still in print, can you give me
the specific info so I might track one down on the used book market?
