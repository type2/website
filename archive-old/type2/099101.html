Subject: Clunky Steering

Volks,

I just started noticing when I turn the steering wheel left to right (at
a stop light, or in my garage) I hear a &quot;clunk&quot; coming from under my
feet.  It's worse when turning the wheel left, but you can hear it in
either direction (all of this is while the bus is not moving).

I had a look under there this morning, but didn't notice anything
right-off.  It also looks like the steering box is leaking a bit, so I'm
guessing the steering box is the source of my clunking steering wheel.

Can anyone confirm or deny this theory?  How do I go about fixing the
clunk?  If the steering box needs to come out, how big a job is that? 
Any special tools?

Thanks,
--
