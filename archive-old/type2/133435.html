Subject: Re: [T2] Bentley on Automatics

&gt; Ok, still working on friend's 77 automatic. Consulting the omniscient
&gt; Bentley, which clearly states through 1979 on the cover. Flip to the
&gt; section on automatic transmissions, which mentions something about the new
&gt; 75 or 76 transmissions being different, and that's about it. I look at the
&gt; bottom of the page, and it's copyright 1976. Upon random looking, I then
&gt; notice that various pages of the book are copyrighted as early as 1974.
&gt; So, what about the 010 (I think that's right) automatics? Are they the
&gt; same as the Vanagon automatics for the air cooleds? I have a vanagon
&gt; Bentley I can check this evening, but I was just wondering if anyone else
&gt; knew of a later edition Bentley, or anything else, because the one I have
&gt; isn't helpful at all. Thanks,

very few changes on the trannys, the 010 tranny has the shift linkage on
the other side, and the detents are Inside the tranny rather than on the
shift linkage, and there is no vacuum lines or adjustments.

thats the only changes I can think of off the top of my head,

I have the 010 auto tranny service book for the type 2 but can't get at it
until I get home from work this evening.

Bob
