&gt; In relation to the tire thread currently going on, I actually drove my bus
&gt; last weekend to get a Christmas tree.

I brought my tree home today in my 78 bus.  but then again mine is a daily
driver.

&gt; First time in the rain, so I tested my brakes and Yokohoma 356's for
&gt; braking and handling in the rain.
&gt;
&gt; It just squatted down on the front end and **stopped**!  My wife was
&gt; impressed as I would have thrown her out of the seat except for her
&gt; seatbelt.
&gt;
&gt; I don't expect to ever test on ice or snow, so can't comment there.

you don't know what your missing....I have 205R70/14 Michelin all season
radials (with a 1780lb load rating) on all four wheels and I ski, the bus
goes thru.  snow, ice, mud, etc, etc!!!   now crawl out of a nice warm
bed at 5AM with the temps in the negative numbers so you can make &quot;first
tracks&quot;  hit the starter and she fires up.!!!! tis a good feeling..

Bob
