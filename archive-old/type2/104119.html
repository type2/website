Subject: A little tool shopping help

Hello everyone, a couple or so weeks ago someone on this list posted a link to 
a site selling vw specialty tools.I have scoured my favorites to no avail so I 
must not have saved it. D'oh!!!
I can't even remember the name, all that I can recall is that 1)it was a small 
father&amp;son or mom&amp;pop type of operation and 2)They had some sort of pinup girl 
on one of their pages.
I know it's not much to go on, but if anyone knows what I am talking about, 
please drop me a line.
Thanks
mike
