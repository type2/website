Subject: Re: [T2] I'm starting to get it!

Marya,

LOL!!!  You might stop to wonder how all of us who *do* know how to work 
on an engine learned it....

You are now where I was when I bought my first vw in 1966.  I started with 
the owners manual, which actually tells you how to do things like adjust 
the generator belt and othe &quot;maintenance&quot; items.

Then you get Muir and then Bentley when you are ready to tackle the heavy
stuff.  Pick something to do and the read up on it, look at the pics in 
the books, compare to what you have and dive in!!

Expeierience, experience, experience...that's why it seems that we know 
more than you!  I have ummm...38 years of working on VW's off and 
on....and you?....and there are things that I have *never* done on various 
vw's.... still laughing...I have other talents as well...&lt;grin&gt;

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi All (especially those in the minority here who may not know how to fix

&gt; 
&gt; I forgot to mention what I did to learn about how to work on the bus.  
&gt; Ready?  I went to Powell's Books and got a couple of children's books - with 
&gt; great illustrations and photos - on how cars work!  I was CLUELESS before 
&gt; and even after reading only a few pages, I know more now than I ever thought 
&gt; I'd know!  It might be sad &amp; pitiful but whatever works, right?!  I figured 
&gt; there wasn't any point in learning about a VW engine in particular when I 
snip
&gt; and recently started reading as well), but just keep in mind I'm smart and 
&gt; talented when it comes to OTHER matters! :-)
