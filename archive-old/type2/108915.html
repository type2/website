Subject: Re: [T2] I've (still) Got the Oil Leak Blues...

Years back I had a similar problem.  Seems to me there were some plugs or
bolts that leaked between the engine and tranny.  You will have to remove
and split the engine and tranny.  Remove and replace the plugs.  Put a
sealant on the plugs.

Good Luck,

Ian
