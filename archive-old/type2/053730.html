Subject: Re: Help I need this part.

It amazes me the parts that are still available for our old Busses- but just
the same- the lack of parts that obviously need remanufactured. As a LiMBO
member I have tried to start a letter writing campaign to West Coast Metric,
Rocky Mountain Motor Works, Bus Depot, Bus Boys......to have them solicit
their manufacturers to make these parts (late pedestal mats would be next).
I think I was the only campaign member.

A faulty gas filler elbow is not only costly from lost gas but dangerous as
well- does VW still have any liability? Bus Boys informed me the ones from
new Mexican Busses wont fit. I've contacted a dealer in Australia as you
mentioned. He said he might be getting a new shipment? This was two weeks
ago and still no word. Does anyone know any small Mom and Pop rubber parts
manufacturer that might be up to the task? Not that I'd want to, but at this
point I'd probably pay up to $50.00 for a new one!-probably more! We're all
going to need them eventually, right? Any ideas?

&gt; I need the flanged rubber filler neck that is immediately behind the gas
&gt; cap.  I noticed that on left turns, gas pours out.  That's not good.  I
&gt; know we've all been trying to fix ours, but where can I get a new one?
&gt; A guy told me he got one from Australia, but the email address he sent
&gt; was unknown.  Bus depot and rmmw don't have them.
&gt;
&gt;     I need one soon.  Thanks.
