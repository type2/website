Spray a small amount of penetrant around the circle formed by the gap
between the hub and composite drum. Lay the bus on it's side for proper
penetration ;-)  These can be a mutha' to remove sometimes.  Hit it where it
mates with the hub. You need a plastic or rawhide mallet or better yet some
careful taps on the drum at the hub with an air hammer...it'll come off.
There's a more brutal way involving physics with the two bolts removed, but
try this first.

Thanks for all the responses to my request, and yes that was a 46mm hub nut
(not 36mm) that I still haven't removed.  I still haven't fixed this, but
unless I'm missing something here (likely), the two 11 mm smaller bolts on
the drum face don't give me access to the brakes, unless I wasn;t swinging a
heavy enough mallet at it to free it up. What they're for I'm not sure yet.
Anyone able to enlighten the newbie here?  I'll check out some of the other
theories though the cable appears to be moving freely and I think I won;t
know till I have a looksee at the brakes.  TIA.
