Subject: Re: [T2] Digital VOM

&gt; This just points out, you get what you pay for. Bad data is worse than no data.
&gt;
&gt; You can get a $250+ Fluke on the auction site by the bay for about
&gt; $50-$75 bucks, send it to Fluke for service and
&gt; insure good data for life. Here's one, 190074796178.

I have a 450$ fluke meter and a 1500$  fluke scopemeter and i have
an actron 7676 in the bus and use it for all things automotive and it has
always worked just fine.

15.00+ship. I think I paid 10.00 for mine from the sunpro garage sale
page.
