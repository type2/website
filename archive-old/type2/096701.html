--part1_ac.2bdaead6.2a8c8bef_boundary

I have a reoccurring problem with a 79 bus, engine stock with FI.  
Occasionally it is hard to start, and after coaxing it to start, it will only 
give me 6 to 8 seconds of power, then the bus coasts for 7 to 8 seconds. If 
my foot remains on the accelerator while coasting, then the bus will 
typically lurch back into power for another 7 to 8 sec.  This cycle will 
repeat itself for miles.  It hasn't done this for my mechanic, so he's not 
all that sure what I'm describing.  I checked the alternator (ok), had the 
battery checked to make sure it was holding a charge, and had it tuned up, 
but it still does this.

I'm going to try and test the FI system with a multimeter this weekend. But 
does this sound more like a vacuum leak problem?

Any advice is welcome, thanks
