Subject: Mike gets Schooled in the price of his restoration...

Hahahahahahahahahahaha Schooling! Sounds like Kindergarten...

Not to be rude (or to expose what could be percieved as fool heartiness on
my part) the '67 Westy Resto from Hell has cost WAY more than what you have
mentioned. To me it sounds like you are just getting warmed up. Like the
word &quot;love&quot; many folks toss about the word &quot;resto&quot; as if they know what it
REALLY means. Both can be wonderful and both can bite you in the butt and
cost you money. As I warn you, Mr. Ron VanNess and others contemplating a
&quot;resto&quot; &lt;or love&gt; Start off with a good one, have fun- and keep it in
balance with all other aspects of life. If it gets to be &quot;no fun&quot; then it's
not worth a dime. A one night stand or a quick &quot;once over&quot; paint job might
get you through (and might be all you need) but both might leave you
momentarily satisfied but ain't the same as a long term relationship or a
thorough restoration.
Your choice on the 'cab sounds like a good balance.
Best wishes,
