Subject: Re: [T2] Diesel oil

So that would imply that the API rating applies to both grades on the
line, meaning the vehicle owner gets to pick which of the two grades
to use listed under each climate condition.

Another thing to consider with the march of technology is that when
the card was published, you probably could get lower than a 15 on the
40 and 50 wt multigrades recommended. So I think the 5-50 is a good
idea. Once I start using it in a vehicle that has a pressure gauge,
I'll report the results.

 Oops, I meant SL.
