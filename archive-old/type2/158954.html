Subject: First longish trip in the bus!

Hi All,

Just got back from an overnight Mother's Day trip to Daytona.  It was 
the first long trip in our '77 bay, and it went great.   Last week I got 
4 new tires put on, and ordered a tie rod overnight for Friday 
delivery.  Friday night I put it on, Saturday morning got the alignment 
done.  Left out for Daytona about 4:30 or so on Saturday afternoon. 

To Daytona and back is about 300-ish miles round trip for us.  Bus did 
pretty good on fuel, about 20mpg or so.  Quite respectable for shoving a 
brick along through the air ;)  It also managed 70mph without nary a 
problem, though there is a *nasty* resonance with the exhaust note that 
makes conversation impossible and the radio useless. 

Head temp stayed around 350 deg, a bit under sometimes, a bit over 
sometimes.  Oil temps varied between 140-ish to around 210-215.  
Climbing a hill would make the head temp come up, followed closely by 
oil temp.  Seems oil lags head temp most of the time.  Bus has no 
overheating problems, even in our balmy Florida weather! 

I did notice that there seems to be some play in the steering box.  I'll 
break out the manual and adjust that, as I spent a fair amount of time 
sawing around on the wheel correcting for wind gusts shoving the bus 
around.  Can be a bit nerve wracking at 70mph when the wind hits you and 
the bus changes lanes all on it's own.  Not good. 

My questions,

What's the top-end of these busses?  The manual states the maximum power 
obtained at ~4200 RPM.  70mph is pushing ~3800-3900 in the bus, and the 
PO set the tach redline at 5k.  What RPM will a healthy 2.0L bus engine 
rev up to?  Is it bad for these engines to cruise along at high RPM's on 
the highway, assuming that it's running within it's temperature limits?

Thanks!

Shad H.
