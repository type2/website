&gt; Do you (whovever feels like answering = WFLA) replace the cover

My valve covers come off every 2000 miles for valve adjustment.  I use
Fel-Pro neoprene gaskets and they get replaced when I start to see
cracks in the neoprene.  I'd say that I get half a dozen swaps from a
gasket before I change it.

Valve cover gaskets are, of course, available separately.  You don't
have to get a full gasket set.
