Subject: VW Camper sale...

Ideal Project for Summer, Essex, England

1977 (R) Beige VW 12 seater bus conversion.
6,000 miles on reconditioned VEGE engine (receipts available)
2 sliding doors, awning, fold down double bed, sink and wardrobe.

This bus is solid throughout but unfortunately needs a new front axle
and there is some cosmetic decay.

House purchase forces sale but she must go to a good home. =A3500.00 =20
