&gt; i admit you are real close on your math.  except you have omitted two

&gt; you have not included the price of the filters for 4 oil changes
during the
&gt; 12,000 miles.  and synthetics go a MINIMUM of 7500 miles before
being changed.

Is this to say that synthetics somehow prevent outside debris from
getting into the oil?  The purpose of an oil filter is to remove this
debris from the oil.  Unless synthetics magically repel dust and
blowby then the oil filter change intervals should remain the same as
they would be for conventional oils.  Leaving the filter in for longer
than recommended risks getting it clogged, which will cost a lot more
than the money you will save!

Without decent filtering, long oil change intervals are not possible. 
Even with filters, long change intervals are still dubious, as not all
oil impurities are solids.  Some are corrosive liquids!
