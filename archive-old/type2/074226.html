Subject: Re: [T2] 78FI on a 76 2liter

Check with some vendors catalogs and see if you have the right AFM to go
with your ECU. I've been messing with used Vanagons for seven years and
I've found a lot of mismatches in this area. Not only do you have a basic
part number but you will also find part number extensions of B and C and
I can't say what these mean but I have found that cleaning all of the
connections throughout the FI system and assuring proper grounding will
improve performance (No! WD40 isn't the right cleaner). Use electronic
parts cleaner and scrub the pin connections with your mother in laws
toothbrush. The connections often develop a thin film that is unseen but
causes resistance. I would not start swapping FI part around If I could
avoid it.
I've seen FI systems with and without the deceleration valve and I can't
tell the difference in idle or performance, it appears to be an assist to
the fuel pressure regulator at low vacuum times.
In addition I've adjusted the AFM spring tensions on doggy old AFMs that
already had the covers loose and by matching tension (using a spring on a
rod) with a known good AFM, I was able to get good performance from the
questionable AFM.
You can also clean the contractor arc on the AFM with a pencil eraser and
get better electrical contact.
When you're dealing with 20 year old parts you often have to be
innovative to save a few bucks.

&gt; Is there any reason I can't run my 78 FI harness and computer on my 
&gt; 76
&gt; engine?  The 76 is running kinda funny so I want to swap out the 
&gt; harness
&gt; and computer and see if it runs any better.  I'm also going to be
&gt; putting all new hoses and other general maintenance stuff.
&gt; 
&gt; The only major differences that I've noticed between the two engines 
&gt; (78
&gt; and 76) are the distributor, lack of throttle switch on the 78, and
&gt; lifters(hydro/solid).  Are there any other differences?
&gt; 
&gt; If I swap the wiring, do I also need to swap the distributor?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Mike
