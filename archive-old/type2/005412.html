YES. The late model VW doghouse shrouds (as on FI engines) have this piece.
&gt;From my experience, they cool much better than the earlier shrouds. They
also have a &quot;velocity stack&quot; on the fan opening similar to the 36hp shrouds.

&gt; Subject line says it.
&gt; I have seen a small sample of only five doghouse fan shrouds in my life.
&gt; Mine is slightly different then the others.  The interior opening that
&gt; allows the cooling air to the oil cooler has an 8 or 9 inch curved piece
&gt; of metal that would seem to &quot;catch&quot; the air from the fan very
&gt; efficiently.  The other four shrouds didn't have this piece.  But they
&gt; also didn't look like it was missing; i.e. no torn metal or spot welds
&gt; showing.
&gt;
&gt; Did VW make differing styles of DH shrouds?
&gt;
&gt; Just curious.
