Subject: RE: [T2] Heat

Joseph,

I'm not setting up the group sale for the Eberspacher (Espar) units, James
Jackson [firesong4ng_at_hotmail_dot_com] is. 

The link to the Webasto site as an alternative is 

http://www.webastoshowroom_dot_com/blueheat/blueheat_products_at_specs.htm

It is a 7000 btu unit, which is less than your BA6, but only weighs 8 pounds
and can be mounted just about anywhere. This would most likely be equal to
the BTU the BA6 would put out after passive thermal loss from the
under-vehicle ducting until the BA6 reaches full capacity. But, that is only
an estimate...

My research turned up a very high reliability rating of the Webasto units. I
can only assume that the new Eberspacher (Espar) units have similar
maintenance rates.

I've had a BA6 sitting in my garage for years and just can't bear the
thought of tinkering that thing into my Westy!&quot;
