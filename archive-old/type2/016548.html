        Actually, performance should decrease. Reason being that higher
octane just means that they put stuff in it (lead, whatever) to make it
harder to ignite -- so that it won't pre-ignite from higher compression
ratios -- so ounce for ounce, there is less intrinsic power in higher
octane. It might not be really noticable, of course, probably would have to
be measured in a lab, but there are more power in lower octane.
       Same thing in diesels -- #2 diesel fuel in significantly more
powerful than the more expensive #1, and you don't have to measure this in
any lab, it's easily seen.
