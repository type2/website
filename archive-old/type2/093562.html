&gt;My rear shocks are shot, but I've been unable to find any replacements...the

&gt;apparently larger-diameter Audi wheels.  Since the shocks have to replaced
&gt;anyway, buying coil-overs would save me the trouble of doing the torsion
&gt;bars, and I'm afraid that the larger wheels might require the coil-overs to
&gt;maintain clearance...any comments on my thought process here?  Anybody know
&gt;where coil-over shocks might be had?

I doubt you will have clearance problems in the rear even with bigger wheels.  But the important thing is, what size are your tires?!?  The coilovers are okay and will give you some lift in the rear, but the KYB gas shocks will too.  When I went from the coilovers to the KYBs, I didn't notice a decrease in rear ride height.
