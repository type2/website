Subject: 72-74 N.O.S. GERMAN Left Heat Exchangers $149

&gt; The heat exchangers that were stock on your bus
&gt;  ('72-'74)  were the best arrangement in any bus.


I have my final shipment of Genuine left side N.O.S. VW/Germany '72-74 heat
exchangers arriving from Europe next week, just in time for winter.  I
cleaned out my last known source, so when these are gone (about 40 coming),
that's almost certainly the end of German heat exchangers forever. These are
heavier duty and hold heat better than the Danish ones, so it's worth
grabbing one before they go away. Plus, they're actually $50 cheaper than
the Danish ones!

These can also be used on '75-78 busses if you use a '72-74 exhaust system
to match. In the process you eliminate all of the '75-78 obsolete exhaust
parts (crossover pipe, U-pipes, header pipes) so ultimately making this
changeover will save you a ton of money and hassle tracking down used
obsolete parts. (Switching a '75-78 bus to the '72-74 setup will require
minor engine tin/heater tube modification/fabrication. Nothing major'; it's
been covered in the archives many times and many have done it.)

Danish right heat exchanger (price increase coming soon):

Matching stock exhaust system (high quality and cheap, but no provision for
CAT or EGR): &lt;http://busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=071251053EK&gt;

Exhaust system that allows use of CAT and EGR:
