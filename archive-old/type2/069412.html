Subject: Stay away from Autohaus!

Well, I jsut have to get this out cause I'm really PO'd. We picked
up the Good Old Van, and she's leaking oil. Hmmm, we figure that we
can get her back to Cleveland from Autohaus in Harrisburg if the
oil is checked every other rest area. Service plazas are frequent on
the PA turnpike. Well, the engine oil stayed up. Even though I saw
that oil was leaking when the van was started up at one stop. This
was puzzling. When we stopped at Midway, I noticed a sheen of oil on
the Geo, from following the van. The engine oil is still fine. So,
let's check the tranny fluid. It's in acceptable range. When we get
to Ohio, the engine oil is still OK. I tell Bob again that I could
see the oil drip when the engine was running, right at the front of
the engine. Start the engine, get some on a paper towel and look.
It's pink. Shoot, the _at_#*^ing dealer trashed the transmission seal
when they replaced the flex plate. Bob thought he heard the differential
making strange noises as we approached Ohio. #_at_%&amp;!!!! Could ATF be
blowing out of the tranny into the differential? Geez, I hope not.
I'm depressed. Guess we should have paked up the tools and had the
van towed to a relative's house, and done it ourselves. The moral of
this story is:

DON'T GO TO AUTOHAUS IN HARRISBURG OR LANCASTER PA FOR SERVICE!!!

Oh yeah, the scratched the heck out of the deck lid by taking the engine
lid off, the just pushing it back at an angle, gouging the paint in the
process. Well, end of rant mode. Thanks for listening.
