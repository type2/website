Subject: Bigger hole for VDO oil pressure sender?

Does anyone know how much larger I have to make the hole for the oil 
pressure sender to make room for a VDO 2 terminal sender. I was 
intending to paint my tin today but realized I haven't enlarged the hole 
yet. What have you used to seal the air gap around the sender. On my 75 
I used an adapter hose to install the VDO sender but I'm not happy with 
it. It works but I worry about the hose rupturing some day. Would rather 
install the sender directly in the block per the original on my 80.
Thanks
Tom
