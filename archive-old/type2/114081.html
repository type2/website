Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Jalousie seals

&gt;If you look at the image of the kit, I'm talking about all of the seals
&gt;except for the outer one. The kit doesn't show the two vertical seals at the
&gt;left and right edges of the frame but there seems to be enough of one seal
&gt;in the kit to cut and do all the places it fits.

Check with a local commercial glass shop. I got many or most of these seals 
from them for CHEEEEEEP.

Also when i could not install a couple they did it for me for CHEEEEEP.

Good luck.
