Dan, listees

I'll assume your timing is now sorted :-)

To summarise though, you set it up per the book, then some minor tweaking is
often necessary. Retarding loses torque and advancing brings you closer to the
danger of knock and pinging.

There's a cool web site somewhere that has engine sounds for a normal engine and
various maladies - its been mentioned on the list before, I guess the archives would
be a place to try.

Your idle problem is almost certainly because the throttle cable has been taken off-on,
so you'll need to fiddle with that. Also, you'll need a rev counter to set the idle
speed properly, I have one on the dashboard, but you can get a strobe with a built-in
one (Gunson Tachostrobe). Or I think some automotive multimeters have them. Maybe its
because the left hand side is fresh, that it has less resistance or something? In any
case it sounds like it needs setting up properly - I'm not the one to ask about this
though! I've never got it right to this day.

Most engines after out-in type of work smoke for some minutes after startup - its normal.
Be worried if it feels unnaturally hot, though. Hard to tell without a temperature gauge
of some kind.

Any more help needed? Feel free to ask (pmail, list, whatever)

RE:	Engine in. problems! :&lt;

 
Dear List,

Pleases save my ass again!

I pulled the egine and did the following.
--replaced AMC head with burnt exhaust valve on #3 with an AVP
rebuild.
--Replaced rings on 3, 4.
--New pushrod tube seals.
--New oil pressure switch
--Some new fuel line
--New points, condensor
--New fuel filter
--Changed oil
--All new exhaust gaskets

Put engine back in.  Set points to 0.016&quot; with feeler gauge.  
Tryed to set timing statically.  Light came on when notch was
at 12 degrees ADTC.  Now is notch at 0 or is it at 5 BTDC?
Or in other words is my timing set at 17 degrees ATDC or 12 
ATDC?  I couldn't figure out what to undo to rotate 
distributor so I left it.  Undid 10mm thing but it would only
rotate 3-4degrees and this didn't affect anything. So I left it.
I adjusted the valves.  

I started it up and it sounds OK?  I have no idea what it should
sound like.  Took it for a test drive and it seemed like it was 
idling too fast or something?  In third it hesitated/bucked a 
couple times at 40mph. and did the same in 4th at 50-55 and 
didn't seem like it would go a whole lot faster if I had tried.
All in all I drove 2.5 miles and was a little concerned.  It 
smelled really hot when I got back and when I opened it up I 
could see some small amounts of burnt oil smoke coming from the
fan hub area.

Whats wrong with it?  The timing?  How can I fix it so I can 
drive it 250 miles tomorrow!?

Please help.  The faster the replies the better as I have to 
have this fixed yesterday!

THanks in advance.

Remember I've only had a VW two months and done very little 
mechanical work before then so the simpler you keep it the better.
