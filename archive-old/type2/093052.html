&gt;You friend doesn't have the mechanical aptitude to even know how to open
&gt;the hood--
&gt;You do.

I think he just lacks the inclination to be anything but a specialist.

&gt;So if he was in the same situation, with anything, not only a VW, he
&gt;would have still been in the same spot.

My point was that it is better to be a generalist.  That being able to deal
with one's devices oneself, adds to their &quot;reliability.&quot;

&gt;True, the problem just might have been found faster at the dealer if it
&gt;was a Bus--but maybe not-----they didn't find a simple coil wire failure
&gt;either--
&gt;Which I do find hard to believe--because the scanner would have almost
&gt;immediately located the open circuit in the ignition.
&gt;
&gt;8 days to find a broken coil wire?

This is as he related it to me.  As he will never say anything remotely
&quot;negative&quot; about his new cars, I take the tale at face value.  He's also
not the exaggerating sort.

&gt;  Who said the wrenches at GM were geniuses?

Dunno.  Wasn't me.

&gt;Reliability is in direct conjunction with the amount of time one wants
&gt;to spend working on his vehicle, and the VW's demand much more than the
&gt;norm----

Perhaps, but at least what there is, is simple--the parts easy to access 
and remove.

&gt;It's a &quot;Bonding&quot; thing---:&gt;)

Most definitely!  Sometimes a &quot;Bondoing thing.&quot;  8o)
