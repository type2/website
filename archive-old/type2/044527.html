Subject: [T2] Accelerator Cable &amp; Outside Help

I recently installed a set of engine tins in my '77 Westy, which has been
retrofitted with the '71 1600cc engine. As a result, the current
accelerator cable is just a trifle too short. At $6 a pop from RMMW, it's
no big deal to order another one, but I'm not sure what I should get. RMMW
has them organized by model year -- with the lengths varying accordingly
-- and the cable listed for the '71 model is almost the longest of the
bunch. Is this what I should be getting? Is it a major hassle to shorten
it if necessary?

Also, does anyone know any good places in the Portland, OR area to go for
mechanical and body work?

Regards,
Eric
