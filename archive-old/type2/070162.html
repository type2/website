Subject: Re: 6V Battery Source?

&gt; 
&gt; I hoped to see a response to Ben's recent
&gt; inquiry about 6V battery sources, since I 
&gt; will be needing one for the '64. 
&gt; 
&gt; I've called around the local FLAPS and I get
&gt; laughed at (I presume that is because I am asking
&gt; for a 6V battery).
&gt; 
&gt; Where do you get these things? 
&gt; 

In Hillside NJ I found the closest Interstate Battery Systems distributor.
They're the folks who make the Interstate batteries, and when nobody else
had one, they had a great one that's now been nestled under the back seat
of my '60 Beetle for over 2 years without a hitch.

I'm sure they'd ship - (908) 964-0715, or you can look for one closer
to you.  If you're on the internet, try www.bigbook_dot_com for a business
search - way cool!

BTW, I'm not associated with Interstate or Big Book, but I use both
quite alot!
