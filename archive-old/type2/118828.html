Subject: 79 2.0 FI Vacuum

The line from the intake elbow to the auxiliary air regulator is plugged off
and from the aux. air regulator to the plenum is also plugged off.

It seemed to run fine.  I have a lot of oil blowing, wondering if these lack
of connections may have something to with it.  The line running from the
intake boot to the oil breather is soaked!

My question is should I leave well enough alone, or hook the vacuum
correctly.

Thank you to Richard Atwell for his wonderful diagrams and descriptions for
assisting me in knowing what goes where!!
