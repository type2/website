Subject: Prelim report on GEX engine.

After finding a crack in the case of my 1600 D/P, I decided to get
a rebuilt from GEX, in Baldwin Park, CA (East of L.A. 15-20 miles
or so).

Price:  $619.00  (+150 core charge, which I MAY get a little back)

Guarantee:  1 year or 12K miles, parts AND labor _at_ $36.00 an hour.

Engine probs:  Only prob was the oil cooler stand area (part of the
               case.) 3 holes for the offset part, the &quot;stud&quot; hole
               was stripped, had to be tapped.  Also, the crank
               bearings were .60, which means they are maxed out.
               All else seems fine.

First Driving: All's quiet and oil staying fresh-looking.  Temps
               are cool.

Nice Plus:  Mention the Internet when you order and they toss in
            a Bentley manual or a Muir for your year.

They have an Webpage at (from memory)  www.gexintl_dot_com/  or search
for gex engines...

So Far So Good.  Folks were very friendly.
