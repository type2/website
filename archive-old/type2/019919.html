The fuel lines make a loop that is pressurized and returns the fuel to the tank
that isn't used for the engine so unless both the return and the intake are in
your can the pump will just drain it. Remember to replace those gas lines.  The
weak link in the fi is usually the airflow meter so check it with an ohm meter.
I forgot exactly which terminals to check and what the resistance should be but
Bentley gives this.  This test takes only a minute or two and all you have to do
is know how to read an ohm meter.
Good luck
Jamie

&gt; Ok..I've been tinkering with a 79 bus with FI that had sat for over 10
&gt; years. I finally got fire to the plugs, so it was time to get some fuel to
&gt; it. I hooked up a little one gallon gas can to the fuel pump so I would have
&gt; fresh gas. Twice it sucked the little tank dry and I assume its pumping it
&gt; into the vans gas tank. I took the air cleaner off and even moved the intake
&gt; air sensor off so I could squirt carb cleaner down the intake throat(?). I
&gt; could get it to cough and even run for a couple of seconds, but could not
&gt; keep it running. Again it drained my little tank dry. Sure smoked like hell
&gt; when it was running, but that was to be expected.
&gt;
&gt; My question is, since I know squat about FI systems, what is the next step I
&gt; should be taking to get this thing fired up. REmember to take it easy on me
&gt; since I know nothing about FI systems and yes, I do have the official VW
&gt; book, muirs, etc.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; David
