Subject: Best Bus  68 - 79
Mime-Version: 1.0

Having had a 71 Westy  and now a 78,  I caqn say both have merits...the
former is better if you plan to travel to parts south of the US and like to
be intimate with your motor; the latter is better if you're lazy and very
knowledgable of FI.   The 71 is the best of non T-4 engine busses- better
brakes, better oil cooling,(except for that _at_^#% 34 Pict-3 carb- I had a
progressive Weber on mine- same milage, better acceleration).
   The 78 has a simpler/more available exhaust than the 79, and I've seen
more 78's go beyond 140K miles on one engine than most others before
it....perhaps because the better horsepower lets it loaf more at speed
limit along with the non-clicking valve train.  Downside is you have less
knowledge of what the valves are doing before failure, but mine has
199,300K on it now, original engine with just a clutch disk replaced and
some lifters.
