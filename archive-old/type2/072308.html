&gt; Both my 73's have single 2 barrel carbs.  One is an Holly and the other is a
&gt; Weber.  From what I've seen of others busses with stock carbaration, I wish
&gt; mine was stock.  Correct me if I'm wrong but, you should have the dual
&gt; carbs.  With this set up, correctly adjusted, each side will be getting the
&gt; fuel it needs.  With the single two barrel it seems that you can never get 
it
&gt; adjusted just right.  Personally if I had the money right now I would go 
with
&gt; fuel injection.

&gt; &gt; Hi everyone, I am new to this list. My bus is '72
&gt; &gt; Westfalia. The question I have is this: Is there an
&gt; &gt; intake manifold that would allow the adaptation of a
&gt; &gt; single 2 bbl carb? has anyone out there had any
&gt; &gt; experience with such a setup and would you reccommend it
&gt; &gt; or not?

there is another bomb in the Federal Building. It's in the east side of the 
building. They've moved everybody back several blocks.
