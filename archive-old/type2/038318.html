Subject: Looking for carbs and advice

Hi all,
A couple of guys were looking to sell some carbs recently.  I wasn't looking
to buy - am now.

I have a 77 transporter with the pancake engine - will be replacing it with
a new longblock in a couple of weeks, and would like to switch over to carbs
instead of FI.  I promise, nothing from GEX!

If you aren't selling carbs, do you have any thoughts and/or advice on
switching over to carbs.

Thanks all.
