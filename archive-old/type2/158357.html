what are  you guys opinions onthe best wa yto remove the distibutor  drive
gear?   i have a 16 pound magnet, that gets it about half  way.  i have tried
a couple of different ways and none of my ideas are  working.   please help
me out here.   anyone in the  athens georgia area out there.  i am having a
devil of a  time.



hello ???      first tell us what we are working  on, what year, type motor 
etc.  Type 1 motors you have to remove the fuel  pump and stand.  I have used 
pencials. screwdrivers, metal rods and blind  pullers that were made for this.  
You will have to twist the drive as you  pull it up. remember that there are 
washers on the bottom of the drive itself  and they can fall off . last sign 
your posts as a courtesy and so we know who we  are addresting later  mark
