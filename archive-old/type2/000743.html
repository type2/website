In light of the recent thread, this exteremely long-winded dissertation may
be of assistance to those on the list who order their parts through the Bus
Depot.  If you are not one of them, please feel free to make immediate use
of the delete key.  :-)

First of all, you need to know that of the 10,000 plus items on the website,
about 2/3 are either in stock OR can generally be obtained within one
working day.  Basically, I stock only about 10% of the items on the website,
but that 10% comprises probably 70% of what people order - staples like
brake shoes, body rubber, filters, etc.  The rest of that 2/3 I can get on a
day's notice, so if I get your order on, say, a Tuesday, I could ship it on
Wednesday. Since these items are so quickly available, it doesn't make sense
for me to stock them.  Better to let the distributor tie up his $$$
inventorying 12 kinds of master cylinders, and pay the few bucks to have him
overnight me one when I need it, then to tie up $2000 in master cylinders
alone, which would result in my having to raise all my prices to cover the
investment.  If I can get them in a day anyway, why do something that would
drive up my prices?

The other 1/3 of the items can take up to 10 days to get, or longer if out
of stock at my suppliers.  These are generally items that I get orders for
just a few times a year, like, for example, a brake drum inspection hole
dust cap.  There are thousands of items like this, and for how often someone
needs one, it just doesn't pay to stock every one of them.  The cost of
warehousing alone would drive up all my prices.

You are probably seeing a pattern here.  I don't like to raise my prices.
Anything that costs me a dollar will cost you a dollar. It's that simple.
Being smart about what to stock and what to special-order is the best way I
can keep my prices low for you. Sometimes I guess right.  Sometimes I guess
wrong.  I do my best.

Every morning, at about 9 am, Jerry De Baun downloads the previous day's
website orders into my computer.  At 10:30, UPS arrives with the daily parts
deliveries.  At 11 we open, and all hell breaks loose.  From then on, four
lines are pretty much ringing constantly while my incredibly hard working
staff struggle to keep up with the calls while simultaneously packing about
50 boxes a day, which have to be packed, checked, and labeled by 5:30 when
the UPS driver arrives again to pick up.  On a good day, we finish boxing
orders before the driver gets back.  On a more typical day, we're running
around like idiots at 5:30 imploring the driver to wait just 5 minutes while
we madly try to slap shipping labels on the five remaining boxes that are
supposed to go out that day (which is why you may get no answer or a very
hurried response if you call at about that time).  On a really bad day, a
few orders don't make it before the driver leaves and end up getting put on
the skid for the next day's pickup.  If the person who answers your call
sounds out of breath after picking up on the 15th ring, he or she probably
is.  Half the time we don't even stop for lunch.  (Yes, I'm hiring more
help.  It's an endless battle.)

Meanwhile, I'm going through the website orders that Jerry entered that
morning, along with the orders being taken &quot;real-time&quot; over the phone.  Half
the stuff is in stock and goes out that day. Some of it comes from here,
some gets dropshipped directly from one of my suppliers.  For example, if
someone from California orders a set of shocks, I can have a KYB distributor
in California ship them directly to him, and he has them in a couple of
days.  Sometimes it takes me a day or so to find time to arrange the
dropship.  But considering that we've saved 5 days transit time, he still
gets the shocks faster than if I'd shipped them from here.

Another 1/4 is missing something that I can get in a day, so I order it and
the order ships the following day.  For example, the order may have a dozen
items on it that are in stock, and one that isn't, but if I am fairly
certain that I can have that 1 item the next day I just hold the order one
day and ship it complete.  This is why the website asks you to allow up to 7
working days for delivery.  It allows a day for the website order to get
into my hands and a day for me to order any odd item that I don't have.

The remaining 1/4 of the day's orders include items that neither I nor my
primary suppliers whom I order from daily have.  Then it's a judgement call.
If I can ship all but one or two items on the order right away, but those
one or two items might take a week, I'll probably ship what I can now, and
take a hit on the shipping and ship the rest separately when they come in.
On the other hand, if the order contains 5 items that take several days to a
week to get, and one that I have in stock, I'll probably just ship the one
item with the other 5 when they come in, unless that one item looks like a
major item that could be keeping someone's bus off the road.

Delays can occur when an item is out of stock not only here, but also at my
major suppliers (or when a supplier short-ships me. Sorry, H. Steven, your
brake hoses were delayed a day because the distributor sent me three fronts
and one rear rather than two and two. When it comes to shipping errors,
everyone gets treated the same. :-) .  I have a network of close to 20
importers and wholesalers that I talk to almost daily. This is the &quot;treasure
hunt&quot; part of the day, spending the rest of the day tracking down the
&quot;problem&quot; items that everyone's out of because they're all waiting for the
same shipment from Germany or Brazil.  If my major sources are out of
something, I start going down the line, favoring those who can get the item
to me the fastest but eventually settling for anyone who has the damn thing
if it gets to that point. How long it takes to fill your order then depends
on where I find the part.  While this may seem inconvenient, remember this:
If you ordered from, say, Rocky Mountain or West Coast Metric and they were
out of a part, you'd be out of luck until that one particular company got
the part back in, which could easily be months. If you order from me, you're
likely to get your backordered part within a couple of weeks unless not just
one but all 15-20 suppliers are  out of the part, in which case it's a safe
bet that no one else could have gotten it for you faster anyway.

This is exactly why I can't tell you instantly if something you order is on
&quot;backorder.&quot;  It is very common for an item to be out of stock, but 90% of
the time, I can have it within a day or so.  I won't give up on an item
unless I've tried like hell to find it first.  That can take a couple of
days on a difficult item, plus the transit time to me once I find it. Sure,
a place like RMMW can tell you instantly if an item is &quot;backordered&quot; because
they're only checking their own inventory.  They're not going to jump
through hoops to find it somewhere else for you if they don't have it, they
just give up right away and call it &quot;backordered.&quot;  Yes, I know, it would be
nice if I could call every customer and let them know my progress.  I just
can't; if I did that I wouldn't have the time to find the part for them in
the first place.  I work 12-15 hours a day as it is. If you have a deadline,
let us know when ordering, and/or check in with us 1-2 days after you place
the order and we can let you know if anything didn't/isn't shipping right
away.

Some people seem to have a misconception of what The Bus Depot is about.  I
can't be all things to all people.  I am not a full service dealership.  If
you call asking for an obscure part that doesn't appear in our suppliers'
listings, don't be surprised if you get asked to check your local dealer for
a part number and call us back.  We're not trying to be rude, it's just that
we don't have the time to look parts up for 20 people a day on the
microfiche.  I could provide that service, and pay my guys to spend 20
minutes per customer looking up a $20 part on the microfiche.  At my present
markup, I might make $2 on that $20 part after expenses.  I'd have paid
someone $4 salary to look it up.  You figure it out.  Again, I want to keep
my prices low.  If you need the full service of a dealership, that's what
they're there for.

We're also not mechanics, although most of us (including myself) are
backyard mechanics on some level (just like most of you). We're just folks
who like busses. I can't tell you over the phone whether an air flow meter
is going to cure your rough idle.  Even if I were Bob Hoover I probably
couldn't diagnose the problem accurately over the phone, and I'm no Bob
Hoover.

Finally, you don't want to place a website order if you absolutely
positively need the part in 15 minutes.  I will do my best to rush orders,
and we ship out overnight emergency parts deliveries every day. Jerry checks
the website orders a couple of times a day for emergency orders.  You can
call me if you don't want to chance a delay caused by the website ordering
process.  I will do my best. I have had customers call me at 7 pm and have
their parts at 9 am the next morning.  But it doesn't always work out that
perfectly, even though I try.  If you don't want to take any chances, bite
the bullet and buy the part from the dealer or local auto parts store.

The Bus Depot is growing at an incredible rate.  It's hard to believe that
just two years ago I was doing this out of my basement.  I and my very
overworked staff are trying our best to keep the quality of product and
service high, and the prices low.  We don't always succeed, and you can't
please everybody, but we do try.

Thanks for tolerating the long-winded rambling.  (Hello? Is anybody actually
still reading after all this drivel? :-)
