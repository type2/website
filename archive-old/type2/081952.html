&gt;&gt; Hi everyone.  the wife has a 75 bus and I have a 67 bug.  I am thinking about
&gt;&gt; a type 4 conversion for the bug and was wondering what the major difference
&gt;&gt; is between the 914 engine and the bus engine?  Besides about thirty horses!

&gt;the oil dipstick and fill is on the top not the rear of the engine.

The 914 flywheel is not compatible, especially with a bug trans.
