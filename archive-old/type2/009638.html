In regard to your observation of only a few buses and most owners 
being &quot;very stereotypical&quot;  . . . .

One might comment that a less hospitable environment for buses would 
be hard to imagine that the concrete jungle and screaming 
interstate highway system of the Orlando area.  There are, of 
course, buses there, but to visit a smaller city or town - say a 
college town like Boulder Colorado - one would see a dramatically 
different ratio of status-conscious vehicles to buses.  Orlando is, 
like most larger American metropolitan areas, rather hurried and 
appearance-conscious, and hencehas more than it's fair share
of folks full of themselves. . .  not your typical bus owners.  

That those you saw are &quot;stereotypical&quot; (meaning pleasantly laid
back, one assumes?) would not surprise me in such a place, but 
it's not necessarily representative of the bus drivers in the rest of 
the States.  Generalization of that sort reads a bit on the negative 
side, and I'd hate to think you went home under the assumption that 
the only folks in America still driving buses are wearing love beads!

It's a BIG country, and marvelously diverse.
