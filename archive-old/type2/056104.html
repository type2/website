Hello Friday people,

I realized my dreams had come true a few weeks ago when I found myself
greasing the CV joints with my wife lying by my side.  She's a keeper.  Had
grease up to her elbows, in her hair, and most other places.

Good woman has come to develop kind regards for utility of VW Westy.  She has
a little trouble understanding why there are so many things that can go wrong,
but realizes there is a finite number of mechancial, electrical devices
stacked on top of four wheels.  So why do I have to screw around with it all
the time?

Junkyards:  I've owned the same VW bus for the last ten years (got it from my
mother who bought it new).  I don't know of a single VW specific junkyard in
the state of Utah.  If there are any, I would like to know.

Of course, there is Tom Tom's VW &quot;Museum&quot; in Moab.  It changed from being a
junkyard to a museum when the city fathers outlawed junkyards in the city
limits.  He's got some spits, a single cab, some loaves, bugs,and a whole
bunch of  other &quot;museum&quot; pieces.  Trouble is, he won't sell parts.  A lot of
buses pass through his lot, so he must sell them complete to other &quot;curators&quot;.

For those who ride mountain bikes, Moab is the place to be.  If you do go
there, by all means visit Tom Tom.

Don't work in the summer, but I did drive my VW to play today.
