When I can get it started, it will die right away if I dont step on the gas.
If I get it started and hit the gas pedal, it will run, but if I let off it dies.
 
 My first inclination is vacuum leak. What are your thoughts?
Thanks

Sounds more like a vacuum leak to me. Check the ones on the decel valve, 
both ends of both large hoses: at the large T for the booster and  the big S hose.
Also coming off the big S hose is a smaller hose going to the aux. air  valve.
Check it at both ends..... the one at the air valve splits.
