Two thoughts:

&gt;Did you clean up the connection on the solenoid where the +ve lead 
&gt;from the alternator joins the rest of the wiring?
Hmmm...that I did not do.  I will check that next.

&gt;I know you have a new battery but did you clean up the inside of the 
&gt;connectors on the battery leads before installing it?
Yea, actually have done them a couple different times over the last few days
to be safe.

Thanks...
