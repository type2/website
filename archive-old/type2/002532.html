Subject: 1600 cooling tin for 72-79 Bay Buses

Several people have mentioned wanting tin to install  a 1600 engine in a 72
up bay bus. Just Kampers in the UK no longer has these parts. A poster
posted a website for some company in the US about 4-6 weeks ago, that makes
a complete kit for this conversion, with what looked like a fibreglass piece
for tin, and a rear hanger for the rear mount. I wish I still had the
address, but I formatted a while back and lost it. Does anyone know who has
this kit?Tom
