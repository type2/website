hey Blake.
Funny I have the same problem. I took the whole piece off the back of 
the backing plate that holds the stars, then used a propane torch and 
a pipe wrench to remove mine. The hard part is removing the piece 
that holds the stars, it is bolted, pinned and spot welded to the 
backing plate. With some time and muscle it should come free. Right 
now my brakes are in pieces waiting on the necessary parts to put it 
back together. My only advice is to remove the piece holding the 
stars, use lots of WD40, let it soak overnight in the stuff, use a 
torch, and a pipe wrench (hold the main piece in a vice). After 2 
days of twisting, burning and pulling mine finally came free. If the 
stars get messed just get new ones, prob be the best route anyway 
because sanding, polishing them to fit again would prob mess them up 
more, just a guess. The retaining clips you can pick up as well, mine 
went a while ago, they dont like the torch and will snap easily when 
very hot. Which side are you working on, usually the left was worse 
than the right, which I still have yet to do.

good luck.
todd.


&gt;Howdy all.
&gt;
&gt;Got a tricky adjusting star, and have tried everything
&gt;I can think of, PB Blaster, banging it one way, then
&gt;the other, heat, torquing in the adjusting screw to
&gt;try and force it out.  My buddy broke the retaining
&gt;clips off of his '78 so he could get on them with
&gt;vise-grips, but I'd like to avoid that.  Is there some
&gt;magical remedy that I'm missing?  BTW, I'm only
&gt;heating it with a propane pencil torch.
&gt;
&gt;If anybody's got some great trick, I'd love to know.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
&gt;
