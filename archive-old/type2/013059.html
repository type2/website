X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL - S

Hey volks,
thank you everyone for all your information and
support.  i will be composing an email later today and
sending it to AVP detailing the situation.  I just
have to dig up the date i bought it and the mileage,
etc.  hopefully it will all work out well, ive never
heard anything super negative about these guys and it
would be great if they helped in some way.  i will
certainly keep the list posted as to what goes on.  if
anyone is interested in the carnage i have posted a
couple pics of the head here:

 it might take a little while to load as the pics are
big.  thanks to fellow listee Rob Lafoon for snapping
the pics and emailing them to me.  enjoy the carnage
folks.
