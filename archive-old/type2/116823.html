&gt;The gloves ARE reuseable, if you pull them off inside out, and no rips.  Of 
&gt;course, to get all the finger to pop out, you have to blow into the gloves. 
&gt;  This adds exhaust vapor (breath sweat) into the gloves, and it will be 
&gt;near impossible to get them on when even slightly moist.  That is, 
&gt;impossible without the corn starch.
