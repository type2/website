Subject: Re: Corvairs - was Chinese type-2's

&gt;&gt;Did you know there is an air-cooled, small van/bus thing called a
&gt;&gt;Corvair something or other?  A very bizarre vehicle indeed.
&gt;
&gt;Yes, I think it was called a Greenbriar or something.  THere was a van and
&gt;pickup.

There was also a Corvair motorhome. Something like 22' long, looked like a
bratwurst. General Motors' answer to the Westfalia, I guess--having missed
the point of the question...
