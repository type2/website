Subject: What's a 1/2, ,3/4, 1 ton truck in USA speak

        It is true that the payload of my '70 single cab is 2000lb.
However, from that we have to subtract me (245 :( ) and say 50lb of 
gasoline. So more like 1700lb, in theory, on the bed.
        My truck wieghs 2600lb empty, must wiegh 4600lb loaded
to the max.

        In Detroit truck-speak, this is 3/4 ton. with a little margin.

        My friend Kevin has a new GMC 3500, 5800lb EMPTY wieght,
basicly 9600lb maxed out. 2800lb payload- A ton of cargo, couple
of passengers and a full tank of fuel. Its a '1-ton'.

        So Bill Crick is right to tease the guy with the 1/2 ton
high-rider trash truck. But not really by 2X. Our beloved 'dubs are
the equivalent of 3/4 ton- same as mid-size Detroit or heavy-duty
'Japanese' pickups. Toyota actually makes a lot of 'japanese' minitrucks
here in Fremont- I see tractor-trailers loaded with frames, painted beds,
all kinds of interesting things, arriving all the time.


        Mike Wright- your vibration does sound like tire or steering damper..
if you are really sure the tires are ok, I'd go for the damper.


        David Carment- In situations like yours, I'm inclined to give up
on the original vendor and go with someone I hope I can trust. This is
the most expensive way to go, unfortunately. If you think you and Mick
at GEX can work together, you could save some real money. net.wisdom is
often worth what it costs. And I figure they'd try extra hard for you.
        But the story you tell confirms the opinion their ad in DB&amp;HVW
suggests- MS, or *somebody else*, next time. 

        Bill
