Subject: Bulkhead fitting pipe length
Message-ID: &lt;7thsm6$2cpp_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

Thank you; 

Jeff Small, Isaiah H, Al Brase, Bob Perring, George Lyle, Seth Avant.

I took your advice and did not use copper pipe for a front breast tin
fuel line.  I’ve managed to get some 5mm stainless steel tube from a
mail order engineers suppliers.  I’ve made up the Bob Hoover bulkhead
fitting and am about to set some time to install it.  Looking at my
existing set up, I see that the metal pipe that goes through the front
tin, extends into the engine compartment fourteen inches and ends up by
the inlet manifold, six inches from the fuel pump.  Bob Hoovers
specification for his bulkhead fitting has one inch extending into the
engine bay.  To make up this difference in length I was going to use
new fuel line between the bulkhead fitting and the fuel pump.
Questions:
Is there any safety problem replacing the metal pipe length with rubber
fuel line.  Will there be too much heat for the rubber fuel line.  Has
anyone successfully fitted the Bob Hoover bulkhead modification and had
any problems.  Are you out there Bob, could you answer this please as
I’m concerned about the safety aspect.
