&gt; The sets sell for $12.00 plus $5.00 USPS shipping.  If you order several
&gt; sets, I think the mailing limit is four, it's still only $5.00 shipping. 
&gt; If
&gt; you order from an international location, the shipping is going to be
&gt; whatever it actually costs.

Mike,

Do you have a picture of the new ones. I am sure that you know that the seat 
belt hooks and coat hook, as well as the sliding door handle are all 
available already. I would be happy to offer some suggestions as well as 
some great used parts for proto types

West Coast Metrics got a set of used hinge covers from us to tool up on. The 
guy in charge at the time managed to get a huge royalty settlement of, get 
this, a free pair. What ever at least they are available again.

sliding door inner handle '68-'73 camper (the long double handle one)
door panel fresh air ducts
round fresh air ducts
outside mirror plastic washers
early heater lever plugs
I am sure there are a lot but these are just a few that I sell a lot of good 
used ones for too much money just because they are so hard to find.

-Joe
