I don't think that you'll be happy with the Brazilian muffler.  If
your experience mirrors mine it will be a bear to install (including
heating and bending tubes with an acetyline torch to get things to
fit), won't be properly threaded on the heat risers, and will be far
thinner than the Dansk part.  If I were in your position, I'd weld an
extension welded onto the tailpipe so that I could use the Dansk
muffler.  It'd be far easier than installing a Brazilian part.

Of course, you could simply send the part back, get a refund and then
buy a proper Dansk muffler from another source.  RMM had better send
that batch back to Dansk.  They'll get a bad rep if they try to pass a
batch of such obviously wrong parts off on customers.

This raises an interesting question.  I wonder if bug mufflers and bus
mufflers are identical except for the deletion of one outlet and the
addition of the support tab for the tailpipe?  Inquiring minds...
