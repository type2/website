Subject: More starter problems

Where exactly is the ground for the starter?  it is
just grounded to the tranny, which is grounded by the
wire that goes from the nose of the tranny to the body
of the bus.  the only other thing I can think of is
that the engine isn't moving, but that seems unlikely
since it was fine when I dropped it and only did some
clutch work.  I was thinking of pop-starting it and
see if that breaks the egine loose.  any thoughts of that.
