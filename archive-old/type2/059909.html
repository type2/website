Subject: Good mechanic and good body shop in West L.A area

Hi fellow type2's:

I have just registered for the list and am very excited to see how much
interest there is in our beloved vans and westies. I had just no idea.

I have a 1979 Westy (for ten years already) in need of some repair both body
and engine which I just have no time to do at this time, even if I would
really like to.

I have recently moved to Los Angeles from the East Coast and am really
much in need of a really good mechanic in the L.A. area. By good, I mean
honest, qualified and who really likes type2's that will not require
that I mortgage my new home (already mortgage to the very top) to pay for his
services. I get paid for my job and understand that everybody 
needs to make his/her buck. I am in the West part of L.A. but
will travel a good distance for the rare doctor. I would immensely 
appreciate a recommendation from someone who has had direct experience
with the mechanic(s).

I am also in need of a great body shop knowledgeable in air-cooled Westies
in the same general area.

Probably these requests have been answered time and again, but I just
cannot let the wrong people play with my Camper (it feels like betrayal).
So excuse a newbie.

Thanks.

Frank at fdpp_at_usa_dot_net
