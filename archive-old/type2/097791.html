&lt;&lt; In a moment of unreasonable cheapness, I bought a $1.00 12&quot; square mirror

tile from a home improvement store and cut/nibbled it down to the shape of

the old one, sanding the edge to a pretty darn close match (yep, you can

sand glass).


I don't even remember how I fixed it in there, but it couldn't have been

very fancy.  I do remember I used a bead of glazing compound around the edge

just to finish it off, but you can hardly tell it's there.

 &gt;&gt;

Next time try 'tub and tile' caulk in the tube...A careful application will 
re-
produce the missing plastic edging and it's made for wet enviroments...
