Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Temp Gauge

&gt;The dipstick sender from Gene Berg is easier to install, but it is not
&gt;really a gauge.  Rather, it is a temperature switch that you hook up to the
&gt;existing oil pressure light or a new light that you install.

Good point and not to be confused with other dipstick temp senders that are 
merely that: senders, not a swtich.
