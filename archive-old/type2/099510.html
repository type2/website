Subject: Re: [T2] Powder Coating

Locally I can get 16 wheels powdercoated for $40. I have to deliver them 
sandblasted though. They set there rates at $40 an hour. It takes an hour 
to do 16 or 2 wheels with cleanup as far as they are concerned.

I use a local cemetery monument company for this. Don't remember the cost. 
Maybe another $25.
