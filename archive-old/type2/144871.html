Subject: [fmbc-chat] THANKSGIVING MISGIVINGS  Nov 18-20

Since Tom Ward is out on the road somewhere enjoying
his recent 
retirement some of us got together to inspect the
Oconee State Park 
in Upstate SC  last weekend.. This place will be good
for a 
Thanksgiving Campout.. It is in the foothills of SC
just North West 
of Walhalla off Hwy 107 heading toward Cashiers NC....
Ther are 
plenty of sites... We can have two buses on each site
and all sites 
have electric and water.. The bathhouses are nice with
cold and Hot 
water...  I will post later with suggested site
numbers.. since we 
all want to be able to be close there is a very good
loop road but I 
forget the site numbers at the moment... There are two
lakes at this 
park and they have john boats for rent at the office..
You can check 
out the State Park Website for more information.. 

More to come this afternoon

Feedback about menu items requested... Royce is making
a Ham and we 
will provide a Turkey.... Also this might be a good
opportunity to 
see if we have the Dutch Oven Skills to make side
dishes for the 
campout.. Any ideas??????
