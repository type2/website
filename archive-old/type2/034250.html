Ok Pop-top canvas from a 76' westy. In good shape tear in the upper left hand 
corner. Over all condition good for being 23 years old. I would not have 
pulled it off the bus if was not in good useable condtion. I want 75 dollars 
for it which includes shipping anywhere in the US. Please someone be 
interested in this i dont want to put it in a box and forget about it till 
who knows when. Thanks and everyone have a safe and happy hoilday season.
