&quot;is possible to change out the forward shift bushing WITHOUT moving or
removing the tranny&quot;

Yes I can in my 72 so I think you could also? While under your bus towards
the front wheels look up to find your shifter rods, you will find a coupler
and a set screw, soak the screw in penetrating oil and go have lunch, I've
had to many to break at the set screw, when that happens you have to cut it
off.

Now back from lunch and the screw can be removed, push the coupling to the
front of the van onto the front shift rod. Have someone in the van put it
into 1st gear, now if your lucky you should be able to pull the two shift
rods apart, if not grab hold to the rear rod and ask the person to go to
2nd, if your lucky you can do this by hand and the rods come apart, if not
you might use a pair of vise grips to hold the rear rod while your friend
bumps thru 1st and 2nd. Once apart you have just enough room to remove the
front shifter from it's home.

I have just done this, however my Engine and Transmission are out, but I did
remove the front shift rod before I took out the transmission.

Now you need to remove the old shifter bushing from the front of the shift
rod, I used a small eye glass screw driver to get around and under the
bushing and pop it out, then grease your new bushing and slip it in it's
hole. Remember to grease the ROD that the bushing fits into also.

WARNING!!!!!!!
SHIFT ROD BUSHINGS for the rear rod.
I had ordered new ones for each of these and they WILL NOT FIT!!! on my 72
Rod at least. I tried for several hours, each to get theses to fit as I did
not want to use the old ones or another set of used ones I had, no way no
how would the knobs on the bushings fit into the rod. I have one more chance
to try the rear shift coupler on my 64 single cab latter this year I hope it
fits there?

I hope this helps you out, good luck!

Meredith
