Subject: Is a Microbus a Kombi ?

Hello all,

I'm getting ready to put the &quot;For Sale&quot; signs on my 72 T2 High Top Kombi
camper and working on the price.

I found a vintage price guide at the Hemmings web site which lists
values for the 72 VW  &quot;Microbus&quot;  _at_ Fair $2600 / Good $4825 / Excellent
$7200.

What's the difference between a Microbus and a Kombi ?
Is the Microbus the regular stock passenger van with bench seat in the
back .......  and the Kombi the camper conversion ?

If so, would the value for a Kombi camper in good condition be worth
more, less or the same as a Microbus in similar condition ?

Thanks for any help.
