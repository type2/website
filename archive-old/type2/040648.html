Dave, et. al.,

I *KNEW* I would get taken to task over stuff left out!

The compression test was done post valve adjustment during the tune-up 
procedure al a Muir.  I don't believe I have tested the compression in a 
while (meaning not EVERY tune-up).

There has been a time or two when the oil level ran low enough to cause the 
oil pressure light to flicker at RPMs higher than 2,000 (pulled over 
immediately and put more oil in).  This is when Lurch was hemorrhaging due to 
a blown front main seal.  The cylinder head temperature didn't get above 350 
during these episodes.  Don't know if this is relevant or not.

I just went out to look at the vacuum gauge.  Its NOT psi, its inches (of 
mercury).  Sorry about the screw-up with the units.
