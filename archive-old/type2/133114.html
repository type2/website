Subject: Re: [T2] 1600 Rebuild Q's

Tom,

I went thru the rod thing a couple of years ago and there are places on 
the net that tell you how to build a device to do it end for end.

Basically, I gave up and just did the overall weight(like the factory 
did)....better to go ahead and pay for a complete balance job from an 
engine shop.

2: pictures?  can you catch a fingernail in the scratches?....unless they 
are *very* wide, I wouldn't worry about them.  Even 4 or 5 thousands'th
spread across a bearing shell is not going to bother it.  I surely 
wouldn't try to sand them out as you will distort the bores.

Plastigauge if you like, but after I did it a couple of times, I gave up.
the only place you can do it on the main bearings is in the middle...
And you should be able to tell about the rod bearings by feel and the 
book....by all means do the rods if you want though.

Measure the crank bearing diameters with a micrometer and if they are 
within spec and your bearings are correct for the outer and inner surface dimensions, you 
are pretty much done....rods are different though and I have usually been 
disapointed with the side to side play.

Cheers, dave

&gt; The rebuild of my 1600 (well, 1500 H Case as a 1600) is going veeerrrrry 
&gt; slooooooow, but I did manage to pressure wash the case the other day and 
&gt; pick up some tools I needed (with mixed success).
&gt; 
&gt; Couple Questions though:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) I need to balance the rods end for end, right?  Each end should be 
&gt; roughly the same weight (+/- 0.5 g) as the others?  Or do I just balance 
&gt; the total mass of the rod.  I didn't see any reference to end-for-end 
&gt; balancing in Wilson or How to Hot Rod...
&gt; 
&gt; 2) I looked at my main bearing seats and there are a couple of scratches 
&gt; on the surface.  I'm pretty sure that the case came this way from the 
&gt; 
&gt; 3) Do I need to plastigage the clearance on my main crank bearings (given 
&gt; that I'll be trying to remove these scratches!), or just the rod bearings?
&gt; I didn't notice any mention of doing the former, but it seems like it 
&gt; would be a sensible thing...
&gt; 
&gt; Again, any insights, thoughts, and/or opinions are most welcome.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
