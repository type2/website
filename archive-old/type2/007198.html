Subject: RE: chassis/serial numbers

The VIN plate should have the date on it in clear text. If not the code has
the year and the M plate has the date.

233 indicates a 1973 Kombi

2 - Transporter
3 - Kombi
3 - Year (last digit)

The M code will give the actual production date in the lower left corner.
The three digits represent the week of the year and the day of the week
respectively. Note that this is the calendar year preceding the actual model
year.

Your's being a 73 model surely has the thicker break pads and correspoding
calipers.

Check the type2_dot_com library for 'M-code options' and 'VIN'.

&gt;Where on the www can someone find the breakdown on
&gt;chassis/serial numbers. We are try to find out when
&gt;serial numder 233 211 6330 was built to be able to
&gt;tell if it has 72 or 73 front brakes
