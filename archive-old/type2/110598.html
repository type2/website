Subject: so cal junk yard report

o how i love rain days, 25% discount here in so cal. 
got a bunch of bus stuff but here is the cool part for
all you bus lovers out there, 3 air cooled vanagons
and a safari camper with all the cabinets looking
relatively good in the impound section of the yard so
as soon as they come out good deals abound.  so
anyway, willmington, ca (just above long beach)
ecology auto recyclers.

on the baltic birch front, i finished my ceiling in my
new hi roof top that i replaced the westy top with and
it looks awsome, i got the 5x5 sheets of baltic birch
from Good Woods in Los Alamitos which is on the OC/LA
county border for about 14$ a sheet.  there number is
562.493.7911 if you need some before the vw classic.  

i finally found my curtain fabric, got 20 yards for
3.50 a yard, cool!!  instead of putting cabintets up
top in the hi roof i'm going to put curtains up there
instead and have a netting system to hold my clothes
up there.

well, time to sign off, everyone have a nice day.
