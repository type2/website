Subject: seat belts in a splitty

Hi gang,

I just put a back seat in my 1960 bus and was wondering how you guys are 
doing seat belts.  Are you drilling holes in the floor? or attaching belts to the 
seat frames?

I know wifey won't permit the offspring to ride without seatbelts.

Jacques near Ellensburg, WA

P.S. I'm still looking for a middle seat frame too.  I'd like to use the bus 
to haul my boys and their buddies.
