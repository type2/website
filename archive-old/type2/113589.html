Subject: Re: [T2] ordered tires...interesting

&gt;And then I had to jump all over his a## when he tried to hammer the weights on
&gt;the outide rim of my Fuchs. He said he was out of the sticky kind that goes
&gt;inside. I made him find the manager and find more of the right kind of
&gt;weights.

The girl at Wal-Mart (knew more than I did about tires) was trying to put 
the stick on weights on my newly powdercoated wheels for my bus. Couldn't 
get the placement just right and get the wheels to balance. I was worried 
somehow she was going to ruin the new finish so I went with stock hammer on 
weights. I could just see here peeling the &quot;paint&quot; off removing a weight. 
Lesser of two evils.

Best tires I've ever had.  Same with the powdercoating. Now problems in 2 
years. Of course I haven't driven it yet... &lt;griN&gt;
