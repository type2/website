Subject: Re-Working the Engine Bay?!

Hey guys,

      Now that I realize that I am missing some engine tin, I've decided
I'm going to take everything apart, down to just the bare block, and
re-install all the engine tin, brackets, whatever.. to make sure that I'm
not missing anything. I decided that I'm going to go through
EVERYTHING...

With this in mind, I had a few questions:

1) I replaced my regular fuel line, but I've learned that my Bus has some
sort of wild fuel evap system with a series of tubes that run all along
the inner wals of my Bus (including in the area where the engine vents
are). Do I need to replace these rubber fittings in between there? It
appears to me as if my fuel tank isn't even hooked up to this evap set-up
anymore. I am completely missing that evaporative canister that I
normally see hanging above in other busses. I have that long oblong
shaped bracket, but there is nothing in there. Is it important that I
re-install this? 

2) I have a sensor attached to the end of my transmission, well.. there
are two. One is for the reverse light, and the other apparently, when I
looked it up in my Bentley catalog,  is engaged when I go into 4th gear.
Why do I need this? Maybe I didn't look in the right place, but is this
supposed to hook up to anything?.. like, maybe a light on the Dash?
(OverDrive or something?)

3) Assuming the timing, cooling, and everything else is correct in my
Bus... can I install a high-output ignition coil? I have a 12-Volt
universal Accel Super Coil brand new in the box that I found in the
garage when I bought my house. It's the same dimensions as the coil in my
Bus. Will this cause the Bus to run hotter, or will it help improve the
emissions / power of my Bus?

4) The floor of the battery tray was rusted out, and the previous owner
just put sheet after sheet after sheet of fiberglass down, and even
molded in a piece of wood. I DO have a welder, but wanted to hear from
some people who have done this. When you welded in a new battery tray,
what precautions if any did you take. My garage almost always smells like
gas when I go in there (I think it's comming from the Bus). I assume I
can get this floor piece from Busted Bus.

5) I live in South Florida, and it's highly unlikely that I'll be taking
my Bus anywhere in the wintertime up north. THAT, plus the fact that my
Bus is already missing 90% of the heating equipment (fants, etc), I would
like to just completely remove what's left. Can anyone tell me if there
is a kit I can purchase from somewhere that will eliminate the heat
exchangers? Correct me if I'm wrong, but it looks as if the exhaust pipes
come out of the cyl head, and then go back into a long loop, and then
come back again. They are then surrounded by a piece of tin-work in which
a heater pipe is attached and that's where the supposed fans suck the air
through and into the cabin. I have none of this, except the heat
exchangers themselves, so I'm just going by the Bentley manual. I would
LOVE to simply replace this stuff with straight pipes straight from the
cyl heads, to the factory mufflers. Actually, if anyone knows where I can
get one of these in stainless steel.. I would plan on wrapping these with
header tape to help eliminate any possible heat from the engine
compartment. I'm a bit ridiculous when it comes to the cooling of the
car. The idea that there's no radiator freaks me out... so I want to do
WHATEVER I can to make this Bus run cooler.

6) Is there supposed to be a seal in between the two halves of the
aluminum fan surround? There is also a small hole at the very bottom of
this as well, I'm wondering if I should patch that hole up, or if it's
used for water drainage? 

Sorry for all the questions, but I'd like to get this Bus to be as
reliable as possible.


Thanks!

Todd
