Subject: Re: [T2] re: Tire twist

George--

I think this way about it--

Discount Tire is a pretty big nationwide outfit--and I don't think thy
would be setting themselves up for a class action BS litigation by
sawing up some tires--

They offer this service on brand new hoops--not just older one's.
And actually in cutting the tires will offer longer tire life by
allowing them to run cooler---the sipes will disipate heat quicker--

What you ought to do is get on-line and quiz them about this service
they offer--

You might learn something new--( or old stuff rediscovered )

Or if you want--let me know where abouts your at--I'll hook you up with
a phone number to a close by store--you can talk to them in person, and
get an exact explaination of the cutting theory, and it's
merits--downfalls.

Or the next time it snows here in the Windy I'll take my Westy out from
under it's cover, and take a blast in the white stuff and report on my
findings---

Later,

Terry


E-mail message

You can get it done in many tire stores in the northern tier states.
Seems to me that if it was a good idea the manufacturers would do it at
the factory. I have a feeling that there is a downside in tire wear
(either faster or uneven)
I know that my Bridgestone RD603s are pretty slippary in snow. My
solution is to avoid snow when I can! I have a pair of Uniroyal Laredo
all-season that I carry just in case. I don't recommend them for normal
use, though, as they are too small.
