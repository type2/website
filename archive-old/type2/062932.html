Subject: '71 camper

hi all ya'll volks folks

i have a question.  some of you may remember me from when i told of my
camper top blowing off in the mississippi river when my vw was being towed.
well, my father (who lives outside memphis, tn) has located a carbon copy of
my van.  it's a 71 sitting out in a gravel field.  i haven't seen it b/c i
live 400 miles away, but i wanna describe so you can tell me what you think.  

he said that the body is in really good shape (very minimal rust, few or no
dents).  it has all camping eq.  the guy who has it says it runs...all it
needs is a battery.  supposedly, it was in storage for some time and while
it was, some kids broke into the room it was in and busted out all of the
windows except one of the louvered ones and the driver's and passenger door
windows.  the two door vent windows are also good.  he said everything on
the engine looks original.  it's been out in the elements for a while (being
rained in), but my dad says it doesn't look bad.  the guy's asking $600. 

i have all of the windows that need to go in it except the windshield from
my other bus.  my bus needs an engine rebuild, a top, and a bit of body
work.  what do you guys think of this price?  if it runs (the owner says
it'll peel gravel everywhere when you take off, is it worth it?

what is the normal price for a decently running '71 camper with everthing
original and in good shape?

thanx for the input,
paul
