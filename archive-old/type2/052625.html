Subject: Re: [T2] AH case in a 70 bus?

Matt,

According to Muir AH is 71 to 73 Type1. I can't find my Wilson book 
but I recall it stating that AH was also used in 1971 bus. I have an 
AH in the '67 bus and it does not have to bosses for the hanger. I 
~think~ 1973 was the first year of the &quot;universal case&quot; so in theory 
if the motor came from a 1971 bus or a 1973 Be*tke then it would have 
bosses. With your luck it will not :)

You better get that motor built buy EB2001 or plan on having it towed there :)


&gt;Hello-
&gt;
&gt;I am currently assembling parts for a &quot;stock&quot; 1600 SP rebuild to
&gt;put in my 1970 bus. I have a lead on a good AH case. From
&gt;what I can tell, this is a type I case. Does anyone know if it
&gt;can accept the rear engine support bar? Does it have bosses
&gt;which can be drilled and tapped? Or would I have to use the
&gt;oil pump adapter thing (which I wouldn't :^)
&gt;
&gt;thanks..
&gt;
