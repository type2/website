Subject: Re that &quot;8 trillion mi bus&quot; (was Cheap busses)

Mark Hineline wrote
 &quot;Mike Benthin has a bus than has gone eight trillion miles on its
original
 engine, or something like that. ...If you have responsibilities, and
your bus is
 to be a tool for meeting your responsibilities, expect to spend about
$4000 (give or take $1000) in purchase price, repairs, and general
refurbishing before you have a 
safe and reliable vehicle.&quot;
**Actually it's 244,000 mi on the entire drivetrain, starts and runs
like a champ, (oil pressure a bit low so I drive it more slowly to keep
it cooler and blow considerably less oil.) but it isn't all luck.  I
agree that one spends about $4,000 sooner or later to keep a bus safely
going....It cost me $3500 back in '85 with 60k on it and driven mostly
for vacation trips by the previous retirees.  I accepted the price based
on the body condition and kept it maintained via DM. TUFOIL engine
additive was used since I have had it.  It was driven with respect but
70 mph was the norm .  In 95, before a 10K cross-country trip, the
engine was pulled for the first time just to look at the clutch which
had 150,000 mi on it then.  I prophylactically replaced the disk.  In
its life (other than usual tuneup and brake stuff) I have replaced 2
clutch disks (the second delaminated at 220k and while engine was out I
treated the bus to new CV joints and acc. cable), 2 clutch cables, a set
of lifters, a starter, a fuel pump that died when driven dry at 243,000
mi, a set of front disk rotors, front bearings, and a set of heat
exchangers. As I recall the voltage regulator and a temp sensor was
replaced.  The bus is on its 3rd muffler.  I carry spare rear bearings,
alternator, fuel pump, filter, coil, AFM, ECU, double relay, temp sensor
and assorted tubing.  I'd like to see what will actually kill this
engine, so it will be driven until either a rod goes or the compression 
(110-135) dictates quitting time!  See you at Everybus!
    We have a 75 bus my daughter is painting (artist) with decent body
that only cost $700 with a bad trans, and sat for a while- it cost about
$4,000 to do all it needed, including an engine overhaul, brakes, cv's,
$100 used trans, and sundry work on the FI.  Let's face it, people
EITHER sell them cheap whey THEY couldn't get them going and got tired
of the shed with wheels in the driveway, or sell them costly when they
put $$$ to get it going properly and is ready for trips, but decided to
sell because a good Vanagon came along or the $$$ was needed more!
