Subject: [T2] Proposed solution to the &quot;Archive Permission Issue&quot;

Hi Volks,

I still get lots of people emailing me saying they want to see the
information shared, so I'm trying to find solutions to the concerns.  &quot;Can
do&quot;, not &quot;Can NOT do&quot;.

The Problem
==============
I think everyone agrees that the copyright is held by the AUTHOR of the
e-mail address. But I think some people think it is &quot;impossible&quot; to seek
permission from everyone.


The Proposed Solution
==================
So I've come up with a simple method to get permission from everyone.  I
have a copy of the messages, my own personal copy (in my own mailbox
folders).  I already have scripts written to pull out all the subjects and
FROM addresses of all the messages ever written.  These scripts were written
for the previous (now removed by Ken Hooper) archive.  Observations:

  -- People have used multiple email addresses as they changed ISP's over
the years.
  -- Some people never used their real name, so it is hard to know who they
are... (if they changed email addresses).  Addresses like &quot;vw1969_at_aol_dot_com&quot;
are hard to know if that is just &quot;Jim Smith&quot; who changed email addresses).
So it isn't like we can send a postal letter if we can't even figure out who
a person is or what city they are in.
  -- Some of these addresses are no longer valid, so I can't email each and
every person.  People have closed accounts.

But I don't give up easy.  So I thought of another solution.  I can just
POST the entire list of addresses (thousands) on a LONG HTML FORM with
checkboxes next to them.  something like this:

   Your  name: __fill in____
   Your Address: ___fill in____
   Select the email addresses you used below:
     * --- user1_at_somehwere_dot_com --
     * --- user2_at_somewhere_dot_com ---

Here, it is simpler to do a mock up.  Go to this page:
http://vw.i405_dot_com/permission/  . That way we can get permission in just a
few days or weeks!


Not Perfeckt
===================
Business, yes ones that are LEGAL, are not 100.000000000000000000000000%
perfect.  There is &quot;good faith&quot; and &quot;effort&quot; considerations in law.
Perfection is impossible to obtain.  A business doesn't get shut down
because of credit card mistakes, pricing errors, etc... it is LEGAL to make
a good effort.

So of COURSE we can't verify that each and every person who selects from the
list of email addresses is actually the person who says they are.  People
make mistakes on web forms and so forth.  But that doesn't invalidate the
whole process nor the results.  Look at the recent USA Presidential
Election!

Even if people are dead, members of their estate can speak for them.  People
can contact them, and once their box is cleared we know.  Then we are left
just trying to track down the remaining ones... the list gets smaller each
and every day!

Of course, we know to remove Bob Hoover's name from the list before we even
start.  That is only sensible.  His messages can be removed from the set if
he says he doesn't want them distributed further.

New technology issues require new technology solutions!
