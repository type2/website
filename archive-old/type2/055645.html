Subject: Re: Bentley vs. Haynes

&gt; 
&gt; Oh to keep this on topic, I'm wondering this must mean Haynes prints a
&gt; different late bay manual no?  Cause our late bay book covers no 1600 cars,
&gt; and our early bay book covers though '71 only.

Yep, Haynes has available here in the US two different bay-window Bus
manuals:

1) '68-'79 1600cc manual (Type 1 engine)
2) '72-'79 1700-2000cc manual (Type 4 engine)  

Obviously number 1 is irrelevant for US owners 
of '72-'79 Buses as the Type 1 engine was
never available here from '72-'79 on Buses.
