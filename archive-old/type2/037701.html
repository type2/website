Oh yea that is the reason as I have learned from many mechanics. I have solved this by using a modfied air filter system that sucks WARM air rite out of those warm air ducts on either side of the engine, (on the inside)...I dont have heat and that fan in the engine compartment. I would not mess with things if you have those air ducts hooked up as I dont know how you are set up (I have the single carb conversion). My engine is stripped down to the basics of simply running. In the summer I take them off and seal up the vent holes and place the air intake hose in the cool air intake behind th battery. 

the basic thing is in cold weather...&quot;find warm air from the engine&quot;.

I hope this helps. I am no turbo brain with this but it has worked for me in VERY cold Ohio winters!

Peace
