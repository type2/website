Subject: Re: [T2] making window installation easier

silicone is excellent lubricant for a glass installation.
however, the residue will wreak havoc with future painting,
it will cause &quot;fish-eyes&quot; and adhesion problems.
you might consider a spray bottle with soapy water .
it will be a little less slippery than the silicone, but will
still do the job. 
you might also try a thinner cord, like 1/8 &quot; for an easier pull.
and glass should not be installed in cold weather ( below 40 F ).
( especially the windshield ).
one more trick is to heat the seal for two minutes in the microwave.
