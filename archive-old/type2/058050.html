Graham,

I wish I was closer or you were in Vancouver, BC but
since you're in Toronto we'll have to see who the list 
can recommend.

Briefly, I agree that the trans is bye-bye.  The bearing
type noise you were hearing may have been the main
shaft bearing in the gear carrier housing.  The crack 
could have been either 4th or the 3rd/4th gear clutch
hub letting fly.  Either way your Bus is in need of a
rebuilt gearbox.  With the condition of the Canadian
dollar these days I hope you have saved a lot.  I wish
I could give you better news but I think a rebuilt box
is required from what you've described.
