I just  swapped out a 1600. The motor I pulled had a Bosch alternator with
one  spade connector labeled D. The new motor has a Bosch alternator with
three  spade connectors labelled D, D+ and DF. I put the one wire on the  D
terminal, but I'm an not getting charging. What do I need to attach to  the
other two wires? I'm thinking to jump battery power over to the DF  to
energize the internal fields? But what about  D+?

Thanks,



hey john  You would be better off swapping thew alternators .   The 3 wire 
unit requires a voltage regulator  .  the single wire unit  was the later style 
and has a built in regulator.  You can rewire the tree  terminals to a voltage 
reg.  later  mark  dearing
