Subject: Dropped seats and sticky rings - need heads

A little history-
I bought a very nice 78 Riviera camper in non running condition. Previous
owner said that he stopped driving it when the compression went bad. He had
replaced the engine 28000 miles ago. Over the last week I pulled the engine
and found out a few things-

The previous owner/mechanic was very good. New parts everywhere and a great
attention to detail

Bad engine was a AVP rebuild. The crank, cam and everything inside the case
is like new.

Pistons and rings are cooked. Bad. This looked like the old two stroke
seizures . The pistons are scarred and the rings are stuck. Bad.

I hoped that the heads would be OK but the heat monster struck again. Three
out of four intake seats dropped into my hand when I pulled the valves. 

I must say that AVP has been fantastic to work with. I called them for some
history of the engine. They knew everything about the build on the motor and
actually remembered the previous owner! They reaffirmed my thoughts about
the previous owner. In thier defense they did say that this engine was built
before they began the interference technique used these days for valve
seats. 

My problem is that I can't find a quality set of rebuilt heads anywhere. AVP
is two weeks out and all of the regular sources are dried up. The Bus Depot
is sending me everything else but I still need heads! 

I have heard of a place in LA called Tuttle (sp?) Machine that has a good
rep can anyone help me out here? Any other sources for quick turn around?

I had really wanted to take the bus on a little excursion I am planning the
last week of July.

Thanks in advance
