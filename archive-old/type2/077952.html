&gt;Where is the CDI located? If it's IN the engine bay, you shouldn't hear it.

Yep, it's mounted overhead to the left of the engine, screwed into the luggage compartment floor.  I can hear it all the time then the RPMs are below about 1500-
2000.

It reminds me of the sound that those Radio Shack 6v-12v voltage converters make, which I suppose is because both items use similar circuitry.

&gt;We offer a LIFETIME warranty on these (thru Universal), and if the squealing
&gt;is excessive, I'll take care of it.

Thanks!  I'll get in touch.  I want to check a few more things first.
