Welcome to the list!

&gt; On a recent trip to California from Texas, in my 70'
&gt; Bus my generator light came on. According to my volt
&gt; meter I was running about 7 volts at 3,000 RPMs.
&gt; Seeing as it was a road trip we had a large stereo
&gt; system set up, a CB radio, a temp guage, and a
&gt; volt/tach meter. Eventually the volts dropped to 4,
&gt; and we were dead. The battery would take a full
&gt; charge, but the generator wasn't doing it's job, so we
&gt; had to travel the last 1,000 miles of our trip off of
&gt; jump starts and battery charges. We would never get
&gt; more than 8 constant volts even after full charges. Is
&gt; it possible that all of the draw from the various
&gt; sources is what blew out the generator? Now for the
&gt; larger question:Knowing the situation, should I invest
&gt; in an alternator? I'm looking forward to your replys.

In the same situation, I replaced the generator.  Be sure that the one you
get replaces the one you have.  The stock generators were specific to the
bus, but many of them have been replaced with bug alternators.  the plate
that attaches the generator to the fan shroud is slightly different for
the two different generators.

The alternator route will work as well.  Be sure to get good quality
parts.  Some poor-quality alternator stands are floating around.  Don't
forget to switch to an alternator-style fuel pump as well.
