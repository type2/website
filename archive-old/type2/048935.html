Subject: [T2] Volkswagen Parts Manual

I have borrowed a 1968  VW DealersipType2  T2(covers 1968 to 1971) Parts
book. I plan on making some copies this weekend. The manual is printed on A4
hole punched paper and is contained in the original 4 post binder. I have
been looking it over and cannot figure out how to remove the posts so I can
get the pages out. They posts appear to be riveted. Any ideas? I have to do
this in a non  destructive way :)
