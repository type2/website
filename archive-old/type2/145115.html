Subject: Re: Mythbusters european car

Hi Arnaud,

      I just read in another post that someone said it was a Triumph TR-7. Although I respect his opinion, I looked it over and over and over with my TiVo. It was in fact a Fiat X-1/9 Bertone. I am a huge fan of the Fiat X-1/9 Bertone and was really bummed to see it get crushed. I love mid engined cars and it was such a shame. There was no rust in the typical areas too. I mean, it's not like there's an unlimited supply of X-1/9s in the country. 

Why couldn't they have crushed like a small Honda Civic or something?

&gt; 
&gt; Anyone knows what is the model and name of the car that allegedly got busted
&gt; between two semi in the Discovery Mythbusters show. They kept saying that it
&gt; was a &quot;Small European Car&quot; but i wasn't too convinced . The poor guy who
&gt; gave the small car to the show got his 2 minutes of celebrity...
&gt; 
&gt; BTW, these guys would need a bit more mechanical engineering background in
&gt; order to properly smack cars.
&gt; 
&gt; Bus content : at some point i thought it was a Porsche 914
&gt;
