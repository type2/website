&lt;&lt; Of course if there are any other ideas, I'd love to hear them.  I guess
 the next step is to take the case back to the machinist and have him
 verify that it is cut correctly? &gt;&gt;

hmmm...and you think he is gonna say * yup i screwed up* this case is on me.  
heres $400, go buy a new one??  not likely.  just a bit of info for all of 
you people determined to align bore your cases.  it would be worth it for you 
to spend about $20 and purchase gene bergs writings on case align boring and 
crank under turning ( if you are interested...otherwise keep doing what you 
are doing).....ever wonder why vw themselves quit line-boring cases back in 
the 60's??  it didnt hold up, it was too unpredictable to get it right, and a 
host of other problems.  do you think the average (or above average 
machinist) can do better??  think about it and read some trusted articles on 
the subject.  as always remember...ymmv.
