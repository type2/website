Subject: Genuine Hella Tail Lenses on Sale - Housings being  
  discontinued.

&lt;&lt; On a related note, Hella has now discontinued the complete taillight
 assemblies for '72-79.  This is very unfortunate news, since, as Richard
 Atwell has noted, they are far superior to the repro.  I have a few sets on
 hand, and more coming in two weeks, but as far as I know this next shipment
 will be my last. These include lenses as well.
 
Thats pretty weird as this tailight is also used on Mercedes vans and maybe 
VW LTs,
Maybe Hella will make them in one of their other worldwide factories......
