Dear VW freaks,=20

This is jst to express how grateful I am to all of you who responded to =
my inquiries .... and I also learned a lot from the whole interaction =
among listees... This is really a wonderful T2 site....  I'll keep a lot =
of prints-out  for my personal reference.... and will share them with my =
fellow VW freaks here in Indonesia.     Due to my overwhelming bizniz =
activities these days, I am forced to unsubscribe from the list for a =
moment.... and will be back, hopefully with report on our forthcoming  =
big VW dragrace event in East Java, Indonesia on May 25-26 in order to =
keep you informed of what we in Indonesia are doing with our beloved =
VWs.

Very warm regards,
Torry Parantoro
'75 Bus &quot;Orange Power&quot;
