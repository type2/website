Subject: Re: [T2] New and looking

&gt;I like to drive my '78 Westy and look at the splitties.

EXACTLY!!! I prefer driving my bay over the split i had. If you are tall 
it's just alot more comfortable, in the split you are hunching down looking 
through the little windows, in the bay you can lean back and see everything.
