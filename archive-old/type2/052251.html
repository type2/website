Subject: [T2] Curtain set measurements???

Hi all,



Anybody has measurements for a complete westfalia curtain set???  I've
looked everywhere for this in the archives to no avail.  I know most people
just trace over their old ones, but I miss some in my recently acquired 78
Westy, so I can't &quot;copy&quot; those over.  I have a 78 Deluxe Campmobile.




Thanks!
