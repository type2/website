&gt;
&gt; Often we are confronted with a potential purchase whose history cannot
&gt; be traced- and claimed milage is suspect- here is a compilation of
&gt; things to check, some of which are easier &quot;on the spot&quot; than others.

An easy to spot item is the condition of the door window rubbers. They will generally not make 100k without breaking up. And they're a bitch to replace so if they were that's a plus in favor of that particular high mileage vehicle.
