I was recently contemplating this same problem, and I was thinking
about the fuel pump and/or fuel pressure regulator.  The main fuel
ring is supposed to stay pressurized while the car is off, right?
But presumably it would leak down over time (how long?  hours?  a
week?  a month?).  If the pump or pressure regulator is getting
weak, could that be a cause of long-cranking starts, i.e., takes
the fuel ring a while to get up to pressure?
