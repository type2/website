&amp;gt; My experience with my valves are if they are moving, then something is

&amp;gt; guess. 

I need to get a baseline. This is a motor that was built by Jake Raby then
sat in a crate at my house almost 2 years before being put in a bus. A new
engine is going have some &amp;quot;hot smell&amp;quot; to it for a little while. So, I want
to see what the pressures and temperatures are using more accurate guages
located right in the engine compartment and check the difference between
what I read there and what I see on the electrical guages.

Under the dash on the Rivi was a rats nest. I got a lot of it cleaned up
but don't know what may still bee loose or in bad shape somewhere else. I
still have to turn the key several times to get the starter to more than
&amp;quot;click&amp;quot; -- but it always does start. I'm afraid voltage issues may be
making my electrical guages unreliable.
