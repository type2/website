Subject: Re: [T2] Rear hatch water leak help needed

[...]

Are you really sure it is coming in via the hatch seal?

My 77 Westy fooled me like that. It was the window seal. Bottom right
corner......


&gt; On my 76, I have replaced the seal around the rear hatch, for it leaks water
&gt; in there when it rains.  After new seal installed, it still leaks on the
&gt; flat part between the striker and the engine cover..............I adjusted
&gt; the striker to make the door close a little better, and still no luck.  It
&gt; still leaks.  Any one else been thru this?
