Subject: Shift Rod Coupler replacement

I just have to share this.

H Steve Dolan came by my place on Sunday because my shifting and clutch work 
was messy

I thought it was my clutch cable, but Dolan correctly diagnosed the problem 
as a faulty shift rod coupler.  Steve showed me how to take the coupler off 
and on, so yesterday I got a shift rod coupler from the Buggy Man [local 
Type 1 repairman]

What a world of improvement!!!

The shift is now short and sweet and I don't have to hunt for the gears.  I 
was really having a tough time finding reverse.  Most of the time I was in 
2nd.

But with this 'new' coupler, I have a five smooth gears at my literal 
fingertips.

[[  Dolan had no problem shifting my '78 because it was a brand new shift 
pattern for him, and he did what comes naturally with an unfamiliar VW; he 
LOOKS for the pattern.  While I, on the other hand, had a shift pattern 
engrained in my hand, and when the gears were not where I thought they 
should be, I did not go hunting for them.  Hence the diagnosis of the 
coupler versus the clutch cable ]]
