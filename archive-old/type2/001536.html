Also you can look into 4 wheel hardware's website or any other (for Jeeps).
They have them for about 2 bucks apiece!

&gt; Any decent marine supply should have these fittings in stock, in a choice
of
&gt; brass/bronze or stainless steel.
&gt;
&gt; Bring lots of money.....

&gt; &gt;&gt;  Has anyone found stainless steel replacement for the luggage tie
&gt; downs on the surrond the luggage rack? I have a really cool vinyl
&gt; cover that appears to be made from the same material as the side tent
&gt; floor. The cover has leather straps that slip into the tie downs. I
&gt; would like to use this but I do not trust the rusty nasty tie downs.  &lt;&lt;
