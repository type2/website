Subject: Re: [T2] maintenance log

Although I'm not sure where I received it and I couldn't find it on their 
website, I have a 'Pennzoil Maintenance Tracker'.  It allows you to input 
your different vehicles, put in oil changes, to-do lists, etc.  I haven't 
used yet because I use Microsoft Word, but I can send it to whoever is 
interested. The file size is 3.4 MB, if you care to upload it, E-mail me 
direct and I can send it to whoever is interested.
