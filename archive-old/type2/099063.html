&gt; Anyhoo, when it passed through my hot little hands in November of 2000, I placed a cassette of road tunes which I called &quot;Traveling Tape - for the Great Bus Tour&quot; in the baton box.

&gt; When I saw the hubcap baton with all its accouterments at Everybus (it now resides in a big plastic trunk with the original little brown make-up case), I noticed the tape was lacking.


Does that mean the photo of you praying to the Vw is missing toooo!,,, eee-gads!

Make sure the new cassette gets the same photo!,,, or it will never be the same!
