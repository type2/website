Subject: Re: Talking about door locks...

&gt; Guys,
&gt;
&gt; I want to add a lock component to my engine compartment. How do I do this?

Lockable latches were available from the dealer back when the buses were
new. You would get one with the same style of key blank but not the same key
code.

Nowadays..._dot_companies like West Coast Metric and probably Bus Depot have
them but the key blank is totally different.

Or you find them on the back of buses at the wrecking yards and then you
have a key cut to match the code on it. I have a couple I had keys made
for....if I knew the year of your bus I could tell you if I have one...
