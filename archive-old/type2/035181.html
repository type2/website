Subject: New to list, advice needed

Hello all,

     I have read, and learned, much from the list in the past month.  Its 
obvious to me that any questions should be directed to this vast store of 
knowledge.  That is, after exhausting all other resources.  I've done that, 
so here goes...
     My 72 has some head damage and questionable compression (95, 100, 100, 
and one that will not maintain compression).  The more I dig around in the 
motor, the more I realize I may need a new motor.  Apparently the p.o. spent 
most of his time, and money, on painting the van, showing little concern for 
maintenance.

- btw, my engine is a 1700 pancake

     My question(s) are these:
                - should I buy a rebuild or new?
                - if so, from who? (I know of AVP, Boston Eng., but          
                              recently read about new mexican                
                        engines.Please give me your input                    
                  on new engines.)
                - I have also read about the advantages of a balanced        
            engine.  What are your opinions on this subject?

     I bought the van knowing that I would face these problems eventually.  
Also, I realize that a recent post asks how you would &quot;build the perfect 
beast&quot;.  If the answers to my questions are in the reply to that post, thats 
cool, but if anyone has specific engine info ...please send it my way. 
Thanks, in advance, for your time and collective brain power
