X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

I would look for a industrial supply house that deals with
Hydraulics and buy stainless steel line. If you live in the
Seattle area go to Boeing surplus sales. We run 3,000 psi
in our load systems in the structures test lab. Can be bent
with normal tube benders. Range of sizes? Cant tell you
that one.
.............._dot_can I find steel fuel line?  Now I know that

non-VW auto parts 
stores sell small segments of fuel line which has been set 
up with flares and 
hardware. 
----------
  As to useing tar paper etc etc... anyone ever tried Rhino
liner like they put in truck beds?
