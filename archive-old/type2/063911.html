&gt; The 59 Westy I just bought has a SOTO sticker on it.  Don't know much about
them.  I do know about NEATO, though.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone care to enlighten me, and offer a testimonial or two?
NEATO is, IMNSHO, definately the way to go. We stayed with a couple NEATO
members along our cross country trip, and received HUGE amounts of help from
one guy. I also know Tom Brouilette personally, and he is a super guy. I have
never had a problem with NEATO, whereas SOTO refuses to change my address after
my calling several times, and sending official change of address cards and
such. They also didn't send my stickers that I paid for, although I *finally*
got those. The newsletters aren't really worth much, either.
Old Bus Review, the NEATO newsletter is really good, though, and features
articles by a couple listvolk, and I actually had an article in there a while
back. I highly recommend NEATO, it is really a neato organization (horrible pun
intended)
As a Westy owner, you might also want to check out the Camp Box News. I think
there was someone on the list connected with them. (Which if there is, I need
to talk to you about my subscription problems). It's a really good Westfalia
newsletter.
Anyway, enjoy...
