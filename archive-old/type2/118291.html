Hi Adrian

&gt; 1.  They're just reflectors

&gt; 2.  Two hints I learned from a mechanic I used to work with --

&gt; Brake fluid makes a really good rubber conditioner - and after you
&gt; wash your van you can rub some on the tires to give them a like-new,
&gt; but not glossy look. Works great actually.

&gt; Mineral oil works wonders on vinyl dashboards to keep them from
&gt; drying out - please don't use armor-all because it contains alchohol
&gt; and will dry out your vinyl.

alcohol does bind to moisture but is recommended and often included on
small pads with new wiper blades to condition them.

don't know if this recommends it for other uses.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 dumb questions:

&gt;&gt;&gt; 1) the front side lenses are just mock lights? no actual light
&gt;&gt;&gt; bulb? Or did my PO do something weird? Do I have different doors
&gt;&gt;&gt; from a different year? 2)What is a good lubricant for the
&gt;&gt;&gt; rubber/foam lens seals to aid cracking?

&gt; WARNING - brake fluid will strip paint!

Definitely.....brake fluid oxidizes paint which means its reactive.

If you read the bottle it tells you to keep it sealed.  Old brake
fluid shouldn't be used in a brake system because of this.
Once oxidized it compresses more than new fluid.

While rubber may appear to look better I'd be hesitant about using
brake fluid on it.

UV light in sunlight hastens oxidation and aging of rubber so I
question using a product that will oxidize paint.

I'd stick with the products that state they are formulated for rubber
and preferably include  some sort of UV screening ingredient.

Its a little messy but I've used Vaseline on non automotive rubber in
the past....apply while doing washes, etc. and wipe off the excess.


Sincerely,
