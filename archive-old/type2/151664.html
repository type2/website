Subject: Re: [T2] VPC Air Conditioner for Station Wagon

Vwwesty,

Snipped most of your stuff for the lsit server so I could get an answer 
back.

As I pointed out earlier, and both Sherwin and I have one, the 68-71
&quot;kits&quot; were overhead units and it doesn't make any difference except
for the engine/compressor mount..

The unit that I bought last year and the one Sherwin has are the same and 
the interior unit should fit the same.  The one difference is that the 
units we have are set up for an early style interior light...and at this 
point such interior lights are &quot;unobtanium&quot;.

Guys, I really don't remember ever seeing the items #3 &amp; #4 below.
Remember that the two major manufacturers at the time were VPC(in Ft. 
Worth) and DPD(in San Antonio).  But!  There were other companies making 
units for VW's because the dealer could install whatever they wanted.

Vwwesty, remember that the original A/C for bays was developed off of the 
&quot;secret&quot; front 3 feet or so of a bus that was shipped to VPC before they 
came out....we didn't have enough of the front nose section to develop an 
overhead unit till later.

So, when people bought the first ones, they were all underdash and as I 
mentioned before, the dealers hated them because they made it so difficult 
to work on anything under there.

Looks like it is going to rain some more today, but I should have a window 
of opportunity for the pictures I promised of my installation.

I am going to have to try and get the bus up on my ramps as I am having 
difficulty getting far enough away from some of the items to get a good 
picture.

Cheers, dave

&gt; ---- My question
&gt; Anyone really know how many different AC solutions VW (and others) have
&gt; offered for the type 2 over the years?
&gt; 
&gt; When browsing I have seen 5 types of AC units in the pics and VW brochures.
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Front Overhead AC unit. (Overhead just behind driver / passenger seats.)
&gt; 
&gt; 2) Rear Overhead AC unit (Overhead behind the rear passengers, near the rear
&gt; hatch.)
&gt; 
&gt; 3) Westy A/C Unit, A half-height woodgrain box mounted behind the driver
&gt; seat with a large black plastic duct coming up out of it, the duct is
&gt; mounted at drivers seatback location, pointing rearwards.
&gt; 
&gt; 4) Same as 3 (Westy unit behind drivers seat) except this time the duct is
&gt; positioned on the drivers side wall with the duct pointing towards the
&gt; passenger side / slider door.
&gt; 
&gt; 5) Underdash AC Unit.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone know how common or rare these variations are and are 1 &amp; 2 part of
&gt; the same A/C package or completely separate options?
&gt; 
&gt; I think the overhead units date back to the early models with upright engine
&gt; and the underdash was for the later type 4 engine?
