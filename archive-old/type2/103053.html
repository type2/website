Subject: RE: [T2] aftermarket, intermittent wipers

Why go aftermarket? Do some junkyard shopping. My 74 has factory
intermittent wipers. I believe it's part of M-Code Z01 or Z21. As Z01
also includes front and rear fog lights, you only need to search for
buses with factory fog lights (or the remains thereof).
