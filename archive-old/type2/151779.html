Subject: Re: [T2] Removing tin from under motor (passenger side) to get
  to  thermostat

Wayne,

Could you use one of these on it?

or, a dremel tool cutter to literally cut the nut off of the bolt without 
damaging the bolt?

Cheers, dave

&gt; Group,

 I'm preparing to put in my new thermostat and while removing the tin I ran
 into a problem.  One of the bolts that holds the tin in place is giving me a
 problem... the bolt that goes into the middle of the heat exchanger spins
&gt; and won't come out.  My guess at this point is that there is a capture nut
&gt; behind it (inside the H/E) that has broken loose and is just spinning.  So,
&gt; without removing the exhaust, I can't think of how to resolve this - or if
&gt; 
&gt; Your feedback and other thoughts would be appreciated.
