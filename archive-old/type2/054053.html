Subject: Single Cab Tilt Bows

Anyone know what the dimensions for the wooden bows, between the two
hoops, on a
bay window Single Cab tilt canopy are?

I'm posting this for a friend who can't post from work but he can read
&gt;from type2_dot_com so please post back to the list if you know the
dimensions.

Thank You!
