Subject: hello again and westy interior needs

hey volks- i'm back on the list again.  It seems that the list has gotten
much larger than I remember it being. Lots of new names I don't
recognize. but I'm looking foward to sharing vw info with all of you. 
	Right now I'm working on our '74 westy, getting it ready for a
month of traveling and camping. I'm looking for the shelf that goes
across the rear of the bus, over the bed. I could build one, but I really
don't have the time, and my wife really wants it to match the rest of the
interior. I know that there are at least two different styles (with and
without a small door on the front). I don't care which style it is. If
ANYONE has one and wouldn't mind selling it, please p-mail me.]
Thanks, and it's great to be back.

Joel
