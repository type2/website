Subject: Ebrake keeps popping in.............how to fix? 76 bus

This is a real issue for me...........I have to park on a hill quite a bit
in my daily routine.

When I park, I leave it in gear and pull the ebrake handle. I have adjusted
the cables, so it really does work. But, if i pull the handle out say 4
inches, it often pops back in to about an inch, and at that point the ebrake
is not working......

Anybody fix this????
