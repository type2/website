Subject: Welding dilemma moves on ...

Well firstly thanks to all for the advice and encouragement. I certainly
made me feel a heck of a lot more confident about the whole thing.

Next round of questions then.

Given a MIG is best for body work, does it need to be with the gas bottles
or not? Some people suggest it doesn't matter...    Next, what techniques
do you all recommend? Thanks Jan Brier for the simulated spot weld demo,
but what about butts, flange etc?

Finally, anyone wanna be an email tutor? :0)


Cheers all 

Darren
