Subject: Breathing life into the '67

Hi folks,

I picked up the spring plates I needed for the '67 last night.  The previous
owner of my '67 had sloppily cut notches in the original plates to
accomodate his &quot;bug rearend retrofit&quot; scheme.  Halfway through (after both
plates were cut up) he decided it wouldn't work, so I inherited a small mess
to deal with.  The used replacement spring plates I bought from a local
busser look like they were left outside--rusted torsion bars are still mated
to the plates.  I attempted to liberate the plates from the bad bars last
night, but they wouldn't budge even with my enormous 2 arm industrial size
gear puller trying to press the torsion bar out.  I sprayed them liberally
with liquid wrench and will launch my second attack on them tonight, this
time with heat and heavy hammer blows.

The guy I bought the plates from is restoring a '67 walk-through westy and
he gave me a little tour of the in progress restoration.  Basically he had
to weld panels all along the lower 1/4 of the bus to remedy rust and body
damage, floor/rail repair.   It's been a year since he started doing the
restoration in his spare time and it's coming along nicely.  After the rust
was repaired, he sandblasted the entire undercarriage and painted it pearl
white.  I'd say he still has another 4-6 months to go before the
body/interior is completed.  

What was especially inspiring was some of his unground welds look about as
good as mine, so the good news is, even if I don't improve my welds, it will
only cost me in grinding wheels! ;).

He did a wonderful job welding the front driver's side section.  A tree fell
on the roof there and crushed the top, door, dash corner, and part of the
nose.  He cut a section off a donor bus and welded it in perfectly.  I'm no
bodywork connoisseur, but the finished product looked damn good to my eye.

Altogether an inspiring visit and more proof there are unknown hordes of us
bus nuts out there.
