Subject: 9 seats?

Craig K,
How do you have so many Sitz in your 70 neunsitzer? That's a lot of sitz!
Who has successfully turned a late loaf westy with only 4 seatbelts into a
funfsitzer? Did you do it right and safely? Did you weld, drill, what?
Has anyone ever rigged a slide-in middle seat on a westy like the vanagon
westys? It is SO handy to have a  siebsitzer deluxe westy!
Thanks.
