Subject: RE: shifting an automatic ?
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I have a 79 automatic bus.  I was having a shifting problem, where I rev'ed
up around 30-40mph and had to let off gas to have it shift.  I thought all
that it was was the gear bands needing adjusting, I was on my vacation, so I
didn't fix it.  well, it turned out to be that I had lost 2nd gear, and
letting off the accellerator shifted to 3rd.  well, by not having it fixed,
the 3rd and reverse gears gave out on me.

I am not much of a mechanic, but unless you want a $900-1250 tranny rebuild,
I would have it looked at.
