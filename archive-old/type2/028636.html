Don,

I rebuilt a 2.0 and didn't replace the valves.
I just spent about a 2 weeks cleaning them
with oven cleaner. It was a dirty and tedious
job but was effective. My valves were in great
shape and even better as I removed all the
carbon between the valve and the seat.

Between sessions of oven cleaner (rinsed well) I'd
spray them with WD40 to keep everything lubed.

As I understand the 1.8 l has bigger valves than
the 2.0
If I were you I'd rebuild a 2.0 with those 1.8
heads and
get better flow.

another valve question


Bussers,

I am trying to find (locally) replacement Exh.
valves for my son's '74 1.8 L
dual carb heads. The old valves measure 33 mm
(minus a tad). The only valves
I've found here are 34mm. The store, a Bug parts
specialist, says that 34 mm
are preferred, even with a 33 mm seat.

My concern is in having the extra metal in the
head to pick up heat,
especially metal that isn't backed by seat metal.
Maybe the little bit extra
isn't significant, but I would like to check it
with the experts before I buy
them (at 1.5X Bus Depot's price :-)

I have read the notices saying ALWAYS replace the
exhaust valves when the
heads are off, but I do wonder if it makes any
sense to replace them if there
isn't much wear in the guides and the valve hasn't
stratched. I must admit
that the history of the engine these heads came
from is entirely unknown.

I'm not looking at this question from the money
savings point of view, but
from the hassle and the extra time. We could
likely have it running this
weekend if I was able to inspect the valves and
heads and put it all right
back together. This engine goes in only until we
can get the 2.0 L FI engine
built up...less than a year in any case :-)
Nevertheless, I don't want her to
drop a valve before we get the 2.0 in.

Please reply directly, as I am on T-2 Digest
(delayed), but I would like to
get the valves tonight if they are usable.

Cheers/Don Carron
China Cat, 75 Westy
