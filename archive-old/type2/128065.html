Subject: Weird Oil Pressure Light Issues

Howdy all,
 
I just got a '78 Westy from my father in-law. Great condition other than
some pretty severe oil leaks.
 
So I took it to a friend to get the leaks fixed and picked it up from him
yesterday.
 
We checked the oil before leaving and it was just a hair past the max full
line.
 
5 minutes later, on my drive home, the oil light went on.
 
I stopped, checked the oil, and it was almost a half inch past the max full
line.
 
After further investigation, the oil light is off when idling and comes on
when the RPMs go up. In my experience this is opposite of normal behavior.
 
Any ideas what's going on?
 
Particulars:
Type 4 pancake fuel injected
Everything stock
Been sitting unused for about a year in a garage.
 
Thanks,
 
Troy
