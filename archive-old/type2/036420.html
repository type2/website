Subject: does your electric fan have check-flaps?

remember folks, you NEED to check to make sure you have the little one way
flaps in your electric fan.  lets say that your fan goes out.  now lets say
you do not have the little flaps in your fan.  when you turn on the heat
lever, the air movement will find the path of least resistance, thus it will
blow *up* the paper heater hoses and *out* the fan.  thus you lose serious
heating capabilities.  

so sheck to see if the one-way flaps are installed.  it takes about one
minute each side.  take off each paper heater hose that connects up to the
fan and shine a flashlight in the fan outlets to see if the little
check-flaps are present.  if so fear not.  if not, then i would recommend
taking off the paper hoses and plugging off the holes that go down into the
heater boxes (at least until you get the fan fixed).

also you can take a hose and put it up to the *intake* of the fan so that it
will suck in air from inside the van, rather than cold air in the engine
compartment.

&gt;  &lt;&lt; I am looking to replace this fan, but I am curious if anyone has used
a
&gt;   larger fan here (in order to assist with heating the Bus interior and
&gt;   cooling the engine)?  Would a larger fan be too much of a strain on the
&gt;   electrical
&gt;   system?  Is this small electrical fan very effective at all?
&gt;   
&gt;   Thanks for the help,

&gt;  My fan works, but I've also been thinking that a bigger fan would work 
&gt;  better.  Maybe one with two speeds.  
&gt;  Anybody tried it?
