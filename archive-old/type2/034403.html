Subject: Burning Points

Hi Tom
I too had a points burner for a while.  I caused it by leaving my engine
room mounted static timing light attached to the points when I came back
from High Country Bus Fest.  I replaced the points &amp; condenser but still
kept frying points.  I decided I was tired of monthly points changes a
while ago and replaced the coil.  No fried points since.
