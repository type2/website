&gt; &gt; With respect to your experience, I like having a tach on my dash. I use it

&gt; &gt; the engine speed.
&gt; 
&gt; Ah!  you see, the difference is that I don't have a stereo.  I don't even
&gt; have a mono (not since college, anyway :-)  OK, I do, but it is broken and
&gt; I have never bothered to fix it.  I used to turn the radio on, but after 5

I have the same &quot;problem&quot; the radio iis on the floor up in the passenger
foot well somewhere.   I also don't worry about lugging or overreving the
engine, it's an automatic

&gt; minutes, I'd miss the sound of the engine, get nervous, and turn it back
&gt; off.  To me the sound of my engine running smoothly is the sweetest thing
&gt; I can hear while I am driving (even for 14 hours! :-) And if my engine is
&gt; *not* running smoothly, well.... I want to hear that, too!

speaking of not runnning smoothly, put a new head on last weekend and
today had to run an errand and it sounded &quot;funny&quot; couldn't for the life of
me figure out what it was, it was running a little hot too (well it was 97
in the shade) so get where I was going and ran my errand while the engine
cooled off...brought out my package and threw it into the back,  wait
what's that...the hatch was cracked, evidently while I was last into it
I forgot no latch the hatch down and it worked open a little...really
makes a difference in the sound and cooling of the engine, ran about 15
degrees cooler too. 

oh well put in the dash what ever you want, just as long as you drive it!
