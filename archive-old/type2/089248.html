&gt;Knob(S) plural? Do you have more than one? One is the knob that, when pulled
&gt;out, re-directs your heat into the rear cabin area. The vent comes out on the
&gt;floor right where the walk through passage ends. If there are more than this
&gt;one, then I have no idea! Unless you are talking about the big wheel-type knob
&gt;that is actually attached to the bottom of the seat itself, then that is for
&gt;seat back adjustment.

Omigod !!! Don't touch that other (k)nob- It's the Ejector Seat !!!
