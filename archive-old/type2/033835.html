Subject: We all have one of these-here's mine

Hi Ladies and Gentlemen,

Like the title says, we all have one of these to tell. It doesn't matter if
it's a bus, bug, ghia or T3. Some end good and some end bad. - I was
lucky.... 
I had just pushed my beautiful new project into my garage and stood there
looking back and forth between it my beloved '72 camper. I've read all the
posts and heard the stories so the camper has new and regularly inspected
fuel lines as well as a good extinguisher mounted right beside the drivers
seat; where I can get at it in an emergency. The '65 project was recently
purchased with less the 100,000 original kilometers and one owner. The
interior is in super shape and there is NO, thats right-No, rust at all on
the pan. Just beautiful! 

As the battery in the '65 was bad, I replaced it and had decided to fire her
up to listen to the motor. The car  had been sitting for awhile so it didn't
crank right up. I pumped the gas pedal and perservered. I started smelling
gas as the engine caught and realized I had probably flooded it. Finally it
kicked over and I sat there revving the engine and happily contemplating our
future. Like most of us would, I then went back to the engine compartment to
rev the engine directly at the carb. (Thats part of the fun...)
This I did. The smell of gasoline was almost overpowering. Then I saw it. A
beautiful golden arc, almost perfect in it's geometry, shooting from a pin
hole leak in the fuel line between the pump and the carb, hitting the fan
housing and flowing straight down towards the hot exhaust system.

The scream I let out was loud and high pitched in it's panic´d terror. I
jumped up and ran to turn the ignition off. I continued over to one of the
two extinguishers I have in the garage and ran back to my potential inferno.
I heard a slight sizzle in the area of the left heat exchanger and popped
off a volley from the extinguisher just to be sure. That was it. I waited
and it waited. After about a half hour I had calmed down enough to clean
everything up a go home. The gas puddle I found under the engine was about 2
feet in diameter and sloping towards my bus.

I guess you can never hear this enough: Change the fuel lines!  As soon as
you get a new project, Change the fuel lines!

As for me, I'm giving my '65 project the working name of &quot;Widowmaker&quot;. And
changing all the fuel lines.....

Thanks for listening,
