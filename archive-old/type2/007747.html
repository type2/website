Subject: Is my engine dead?
Date: Mon, 16 Nov 1998 20:17:19 PST

Hello Fellow Type2 Readers:

My beloved '79 bus, has about 8k on a professional engine rebuild and 
was running excellent up to about two weeks ago.  It began running rough 
on startup (which I attributed to the cold weather) and the idle was 
slow until it warmed up then ran fine except for a groaning noise while 
accelerating that I figured was my right rear CV in need of my 
attention.  

I took a 300 mile trip to Park Rapids, Minn last weekend.  On the way, I 
started loosing power--I really had to put my foot to the floor to 
go--otherwise it just bogged down and made bad sounding noises.  So I 
pulled over and checked the timing, dwell, rpms, and everything seemed 
to be working fine.  Then I started pulling spark plug wires from the 
distributor and found that when I pull the number 1 wire it ran the 
same.  It was getting spark, but no difference connected or 
disconnected.  When I got to Park Rapids the engine wasn't idling well 
at all.  The engine was wobbling pretty good and making a banging kind 
of noise.  I first thought it was backfireing, but after further 
inspection it sounded like an engine knocking against the body.

Well when I got back home (St. Paul, Minn) I bought a compression 
tester, warmed up the engine, and tested: #1 -- 85psi, #2 -- 100, #3 -- 
115, and #4 -- 120.  I sprayed oil in #1 as per the Muir book and got 
95psi.  I have not touched the hydraulic valves yet, but it is the first 
thing I will check tomorrow morning.

My questions are:
1.  Did I do something wrong to create this problem?

2.  Any suggestions as to what is wrong?  worn rings?  or valves?

3.  Are there any good VW mechanics in St. Paul/Minneapolis that someone 
could recommend?


Thanks!

Matt
