Subject: Heat Without Heater Boxes?

Some of the more powerful engine swaps (www.msdsinc_dot_com or 
www.aircooledtechnology_dot_com) out there delete the heater 
boxes. If I go this route(no heater boxes) but I have a BA6 
can I still get decent heat?

Anyone know of any other good air cooled engine swaps for a 
1980 Vanagon (Don't say Corvair... I want newer not older).

Thanks,
Chris
