Subject: [T2] Transmission support

The '72-'79 trans will not fall to the ground when you remove the engine.
It does not hang by the CVs, it will not fall, you do not need to support
it.  It is held in by two bolts that secure the bellhousing to the frame of
the Bus.

The '68-'71 transmission is NOT supported independently of the engine, and
it WILL fall to the ground if you take the engine out without supporting the
transmission.
