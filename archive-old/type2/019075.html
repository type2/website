Sounds like you may need to take the wiper assembly apart, clean all the rust
and gunk out, and re-grease everything that needs grease.  I had this happen
to me once and it turned out I had to replace the entire wiper assembly.
Water had penetrated the wiper shafts and corroded them down to an unusable
size.  Since yours just started doing this, maybe it's not in such bad shape
yet.  Also, I never checked, but somebody may make a kit containing new seals
and stuff.
