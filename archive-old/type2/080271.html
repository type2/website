Subject: RE: [T2] bike racks

Okay, I snuck out of work (because I left my wallet at home...really I did)
and checked. The brand in Rhode Gear and I bought it at my local bicycle
store. Highly recommended!

I have a great one that attaches to the rear hatch door and the bumper and
holds 2 bikes. I think it is made by Yakima (sp?). I can check tonight after
work since I didn't drive the Fau Vey today; infidel that I am, I drove my
brand spanking new Subaru Outback (fondly known as the Su-back or the
Out-a-ru)...a go-to-the-snow car with heat (I finally caved in after 11
years of &quot;snow camping&quot; in the bus on ski trips.)

Does anyone know where I can get a bike rack for my 1978 VW 
Campmobile?
