Subject: Re: [T2] Who turned out the lights?

Blaine,

Start limbering up now!&lt;grin&gt; and warming up the VOM.

Start by cleaning all of the fuses and contacts well.
Clean all of the grounds everywhere.

Then see what you have.  Instrument lights might be a bad rheostat
in the lightswitch.

Cheers, dave

&gt; I hopped in my bus last night right around sunset to go drive to a concert
&gt; and realized as it got darker that all of my lights were out (tail lights,
&gt; instrument lights, etc.) except for my headlights.  I took the long and
&gt; cop-free way home from the show and this morning tried to figure it out.
&gt; It's not a fuse or a wire-eating rat and I haven't changed anything in the
&gt; last couple weeks that would have this effect.  I've been meaning to change
&gt; the dimmer relay to get my high beams working but I haven't gotten around to
&gt; that.  Does anyone have any ideas what could cause this?  I have a
&gt; multimeter and I'm ready for that oh-so awkward working-under-the-dash
&gt; contortionist position.
