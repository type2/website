&gt; We'll, I broke out the digital multimeter with
&gt; hopes of figuring out why I've had starting

&gt; hotstart problem.  I've had it quite awhile and
&gt; lost my directions.  Anyway, I crossed the
&gt; positive and negative across the battery and made
&gt; smoke from within the thin.  Any chance I didn't
&gt; kill it?

Smoke from inside is a Very Bad Sign.  You can't hurt a digital meter by
hooking it up backwards, but you can hurt it by setting it up for current
(&quot;A&quot; dial setting or lead sockets) and then putting it across an unlimited
current source (like your battery)

Back in the analog meter days, my electronics instructor referred to this
as &quot;turning your meter into a motor&quot;.  These days, most meters have a fuse
inside that blows if you screw things up, but that doesn't usually involve
smoke.  I was at a physics teacher workshop with a dozen well-educated and
supposedly savvy teachers.  Within two days we had  blown the fuses in
three of the meters.  Don't feel bad about it!

There are probably a few &quot;how to use a  multimeter&quot; pages out there if you
try a Google search.

Basically, you want to put the leads in the &quot;common&quot; and &quot;voltage&quot; sockets
and then set the dial to &quot;20V&quot;.  At this point, there is nothing in a bus
that will hurt the meter with the exception of the high tension side of
the coil.
