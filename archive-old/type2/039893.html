	I think Doktor Tim is a bit harsh here. While changing oil
every 1500 miles will solve most problems, in a dusty environment
even after an oil bath AIR filter, an oil filter is nice. Which is
why VW in Mexico puts a spin-on filter on the Type I motors in
new Old Beetles made next to the factory that makes new New Beetles
in Pueblo. If you can get your hands on one of these chimeric
Mexican oil-pump and filter kits you've got something engineered
with some attention to the bottom line. If you just hang an external
filter on the stock pump, well, yep, Tim's got that about right.
	Now if someone can compare the pump and gears within on one
of these Mexican engines with the stock German built item... If
they're the same, then oil-pump-plate spin-on's are just fine :)
	Of course, the clever Mexicans stick Rabbit 1600cc FI engines
in their Type 2/68s, which solves any number of other problems :)

&gt; I'd like to add a full flow oil filter system to the bus' engine.
&gt; How is this possible, with the 68-70 engine mounting brace in place?
&gt; (I'm guessing it will obstruct the oil feed from the pump).
