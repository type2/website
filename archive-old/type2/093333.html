Subject: Re: [T2] Head repair question


&gt;My question, can the machine shop successfully tig? weld this groove to 
&gt;fill then machine it back flat?  There are no cracks that I see.

Yes. TIG and machine.

&gt;It was OK before with sealing, no problems this side even tho the shim 
&gt;warped.  Question:  Can I have the machine shop machine this surface back 
&gt;flat?  The contact surface is a little higher where the cylinder sits from 
&gt;the inside of the head so there is a little room there but I imagine they 
&gt;would machine it even with the head surface.  Do I need this lip?  Would 
&gt;this be OK?  I guess I can have both heads machined flat here so the head 
&gt;cc would match.  I noticed in the manual it said head gaskets not 
&gt;required, but this one side used them and the other side with the burned 
&gt;groove did not.  Do I need gaskets or shims on the head side?  I do know 
&gt;(I think) that you shim the cylinder barrel on the case side to change the 
&gt;head cc.

Yes, and yes. You are on the right track.

You might be $$$ ahead buying used heads and just reassembling your engine. 
Sounds like the last head job was an amateur attempt, these things turn up 
from time to time.

Save the old heads and have them rebuilt at your leisure.
