Alex,

     I now have a 82, 76 &amp; 79.  The vanagon is heavier &amp; the engine is the
same as my 79.  I can feel the difference but it is not drastic.  I have not
taken it on a long haul yet.  It drives so much nicer &amp; is very comfortable.
I can't answer your question about the later Vanagons.

&gt; I am in the market for a Westfalia camper. I was wondering what the
difference is in horsepower, between a 1982 Vanagon aircooled, and a 1989
Vanagon watercooled. Which one has a better reliability record?? Is the 1982
Vanagon engine exactly the same as the 1979 bus engine?? If it is, then
isn't the 1979 bus lighter in weight than the 1982 Vanagon?? I need it to be
able to go up hills without a problem. Thanks in advance.....
