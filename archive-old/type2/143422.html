&gt; where is the best place to place the jack stands in the rear for best

Hello Dan  I always use the outter part of the rear torsion tube housing  the 
inner part will normally work well but I have seen this part rust thur before 
on a bay window  never have seen it happen on a split window bus  same as the 
front axle center pivot the bays will rust out there again never seen on a 
split. I can only think that the metal on bays wasnt as thick as on splits  
later  mark dearing
