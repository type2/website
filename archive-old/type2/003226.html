&gt; What's the story with the locating pins for the rear
&gt; brake shoes? My Haynes manual mentions them and one of the
&gt; new backing plates (left/passenger side) has holes for them
&gt; whereas the old plates and the other side don't!

They were discontinued in the early 70's.


&gt;  Finally, when should the drums be ditched- mine had some
&gt; surface corrosion and the above mentioned lip caused by
&gt; wear to the working faces, but they seemed to clean up
&gt; OK (and still have quite a bit of thickness in the metal).
&gt;  I didn't see a minimum thickness spec. in the Haynes,
&gt; but I presume there is one?

Yes there is a wear limit. It should be cast in the outer surface of the
drum. On 71 and up:
New: 252 mm  [9.920'']
Wear limit: 253.50 mm  [9.980'']
Permissible turned diameter: 253 mm [9.960'']
