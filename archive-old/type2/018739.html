Subject: Won't start when hot - wife stuck on European tour
Message-ID: &lt;3783847F.9ED95981_at_informix_dot_com&gt;

My wife and a couple of girl friends are touring Europe in a 1977 Devon
camper with 2.0L, carb engine. She's in Spain and it is very hot and they
couldn't restart the engine after stopping for 15 minutes. There appears 
to be a click from the engine somewhere (described quickly over the phone)
but it won't turn over. It has twin batteries and connections seem secure
and headlights strong.

After a bit more sitting around they did eventually get it going again. Is
this going to plague them for the rest of the trip (4 weeks) and is it just 
the heat or is the starter on the way out? They have very little mechanical
skills and I don't want to see them ripped off if they have to get a
mechanic to look at it.

Thanx in advance for any help,




Cosmo
