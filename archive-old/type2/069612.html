3 - He didn't really seem to know much about busses, barndoor or otherwise.
I got the impression from talking to him that he bougth this bus as an
&quot;aquisition&quot; and isn't really all that into busses.  I didn't get that VW
vibe from him, and that might explain why he put such a crappy paint job on
it...

Rick and Susan Crandall are Westfalia gurus.   they have been vwing for a
long time, and were cascade kombi people before it was a NEATO chapter.
    Also Susan has been the main organiser for Vintage Meet in Seattle for
the last couple years.   check out your NEATO/SSVC/Bulli Kartei calendar for
august - i think luke said that picture was taken ten years ago - and they
still have that dormobile.  its really nice.  they also make repros of the
roof vents for those campers.   actually, i think the main reason they got
the firewagen is that it has a WESTFALIA trailer to haul the water pumping
motor with.  it's a bit one up on us other NWeners with barndoors, as neither
Mike nor I nor Darin nor  Dave Parker or anyone else here has a shiny
barndoor.
