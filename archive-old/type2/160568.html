&gt;Well, the distributor was not the right way around.  The key was definitely 
&gt;on the right.  I swapped the wires around, went to crank it, and it fired 
&gt;immediately, but then died.  A lot of junk blew out of the rusted tailpipe 
&gt;just before it died.  It hasn't started since, but at least I feel like I'm 
&gt;on the right track.
&gt;
&gt;Also, at one point while turning over the engine I heard a pop, went back to 
&gt;check it out and a lot of the vacuum lines were blown off.  In fact it blew 
&gt;the part that holds the air filter off the s boot, and it was on tight. 
&gt;What might cause that?  It only happened the one time then and hasn't 
&gt;happened since, and I've done a lot of cranking.

As Mike said, the intake valve was open when the spark fired.

Double check the movement of the valves with the distributor but I suspect that your timing is too advanced now...

The drive pinion has to be precisely position at 12 deg at TDC #1. It has 12 teeth which will add or subtract 30 degrees to its alignment with the case parting line (42 degrees, -18 degrees, etc).

If it seems 180 degrees out and you simply flip it 180 in this situation then your distributor will have to be rotated to compensate. Sometimes because of the vacuum can there is no room to rotate and it will seem like you are in the neighbourhood because of that.

&gt;I'm going to buy a timing light today to see if I'm at least in the ballpark 
&gt;timing wise, we'll see how that goes. 

Good idea.
