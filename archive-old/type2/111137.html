Subject: 73 adventurewagen

well, volks, looks like i got that 73 adventurewagen
w/ the automatic so i'll be swaping engines out and
selling all my 72 stuff to recoup my costs.  wish me
luck.  if anyone wants to buy an adventurewagen hiroof
top, i'll have an extra one along with a ton of other
stuff that i'll list later after i do the swap around.
 if someone wants to just take the project off my
hands for 500$ then you can have it as it sits without
the engine of course but i have to get rid of it
rather soon as i really don't have room for 2 busses,
a jetta, a 4 runner, a bug, a vw thing and a dune
buggy so therefore please get with me asap.  i am in
the longbeach area.
