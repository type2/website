Got home from work tonight and found an e-mail from VW!  Concerning the
email I had sent them concerning thier wanting to regulate anything with
the letters V and W in them it seems.  I can't clip and save, I'm
webtv-impared, but in esssence they appreciate me taking my time sharing
my thoughts with them and hope I visit thier VW.Com website again in the
future, and thanks for my submission.  Nothing ventured, nothing lost, I
guess.  At least they know I'm here.  

-Pat
Of all the things I've lost, I miss my mind the most.
