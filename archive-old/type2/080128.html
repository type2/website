Subject: 82 Westy for Sale

Hi all,

     Due to financial problems I am forced to sell my 82 westy.  I am in
need to sell this quick.  Here are the particulars.

     82 air-cooled Vanagon Westfalia. 2.0L FI engine.  The following have
been replaced in the last year.  Tires, windshield &amp; seal, propane
regulator, clutch, pilot bearing, clutch slave cylinder, muffler, catalytic
converter, cold start valve, AFM, injector seals, air tube seals,  all small
vacuum lines, fuel tank sender, vent lines &amp; grommets, front brakes with
hardware kits, fuel filter, plugs, wires, Pertronix, air filter.  I have
these &amp; many more receipts for this van.  All the camping equipment works
great.  Fridge lights quickly &amp; works in all modes.  Propane tank is full &amp;
ready to camp.  All screens, curtains &amp; cushions are in very good shape.
There are a few dents in the body.  The link below will take you to all the
pictures I have.  If anyone is interested please p-mail me as soon as
possible.  Thanks.
