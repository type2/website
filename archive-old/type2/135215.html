Warped cylinders? I know the Corvair cylinders will warp with usage (they become oval shaped I think) and when they hone them or bore them (can't do that with a VW) they have a special machine that clamps them down and duplicates the pressures of a hot engine. What I mean could they be okay cold and then warp when they get hot? 

The Corvair guys say that an unclamped cylinder will not hole or bore correctly, requires a certain amount of pressure. Guess it is a deal where they have to warp them to bore them straight. 

Has the engine ever been overheated with those heads and cylinders? 

Did you measure the end clearances on the rings? (Ring gap) Did you measure the cylinder to piston clearances? Did you measure the cylinders for round? 

Also could you have excessively worn valve guides? Cracked heads (combustion chamber right through into the valve cover area?)

New rings I assume?
