Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel pressure reg test as separate component?

&gt;From: Jason Thorpe

&gt;I've been able to get 15'' on...by incrementally sucking, covering the hose 
&gt;with my tongue, sucking again, etc.

&gt;Don't do an inhale, suck using your tongue and the roof of your mouth.

I can't help but add that if others are involved and you get something in 
your mouth, it is not polite to spit you must swallow. It is Friday. Jason I 
am going to get my wife to try your technique. I don't think I can get to 
15&quot; but will certainly try.

Gotta love Fridays,

Michael Knight
