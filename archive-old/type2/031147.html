Subject: External Oil Coolers? / Fresh air fan tip
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.LNX.3.96.990701065839.815A-100000_at_ale.orconet_dot_com&gt;

Greetings!

I'm a Volksie newbie here, just bought a '79 Westy about a month ago and
have been tinkering with it ever since.  As I've heard many horror stories
about buses overheating, resulting in engine damage, I've been really
paranoid about heat.  Just finished installing oil temp/pressure gauges
today in order to monitor exactly what's going on.  Now I'm hooked on the
notion that an external oil cooler would be some good insurance for the
long road trips ahead.  But which cooler?

Been poring over the archives, and the advice seems to be: go with the
&quot;Mesa&quot; flat plate type and avoid the finned tube type.  Also, people
recommend finding one with a thermostat which turns on a cooling fan.

My question is: who are some of the vendors that make this type of oil
cooler and where can i find their products?  I'm not exactly sure what
this &quot;flat plate&quot; type looks like...  One mechanic I spoke to recommended
an EMPI (11x11, 96 fin).  Another said he could order a Deraile (sp?)
cooler with fan.  Are these in the right ballpark?  Any other suggestions?

Thanks for your help!

Before signing off, here's a tip which might be useful:  

Had some problems with the fresh air fan in the bus - switching it on
always caused a fuse to blow.  The shaft of the motor seemed really stiff,
but i was wary of taking the thing apart in order to clean it out.  My
solution?  Spray some ***contact cleaner*** inside through the small hole!
A bunch of dirt washed out, the shaft spun freely, and the motor actually
worked when switched on.
