I think it's very cool to help someone. I know if it were me I would
appreciate the help so that I wouldn't have to put my bus in a strange
garage in a strange city or town. Not only that it helps you to meet a
fellow VW enthusiast that otherwise you would have just passed on by.
Not
only that, if you help someone, you will have good Karma!!

btw, thank you to everyone who sent me a link to their sites. I loved
seeing
all the cars and the things you've done to them
