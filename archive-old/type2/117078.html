Subject: Fuel pump?

on my good fuel pump i have an extra tap that has a piece of cloth covered
hose comming out and going into the tin under the engine but on my other
unknown quality fuel pump it doesn't have this hoes.  what is the purpose
of this hose and should i cap it off if it is not hooked to anything or
what?  I had asked this before but didn't see the answer if i in fact
actually did receive one.  very busy here at work.
