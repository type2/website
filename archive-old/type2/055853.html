Subject: re, learn from my mistake

Hello;  The gas-up man at the logging camp I worked at regularly put diesel
into gas busses, and gas into diesel busses.  at least once a week he would
do this.  He had that job for 22 years, and still made that mistake about
once a week.  We would siphon all the fuel out, then push him around the
yard until it would start.  He would then circulate around the yard
screaming the engine in bull low until it stopped burping.  He fueled more
than 60 vehicles every night, so I guess that's not too bad an average.
