Subject: FI conversion from Dual Carbs on 73, 1700 engine. 

I am considering going to fuel injection but don't know much about this. I am 
wondering what to look for and what vehicles with FI I could use. For 
example, would VW rabbit or other FI work. What about Volvo, IF they seem 
available. 

Thanks in advance.
