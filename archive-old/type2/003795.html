I have a question for the list.  I have a chance to purchase a '72 Westy.  Currently it is not running, they think it has a dropped valve.  What is the original engine that was in this year?  And, what would be a good asking price?  The condition is pretty bad..... the front is completely rusty, not eaten through, but bad rusty..... and there are spots of rust all over the body, but the body is straight and feels fairly solid, it is sitting on 4 flat tires so could not get underneath to see the condition there.. I can only imagine from the rest.  Insides are fair, no canvas, but does have the upper cot.  It has not been licensed since '86, but did start and run last year.  any ideas would be appreciated.  
TIA
Gail Doles
