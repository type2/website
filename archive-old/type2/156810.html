&gt; Hi Zach,

&gt; The coil used in the bus is one of the easiest parts possible to

&gt; that they tend to give a warning rather than fail outright.... it
&gt; shouldn't be hard to source a replacement just about ANYPLACE if you
&gt; need one.
&gt;
&gt; Keeping $30 in your wallet in case of emergency makes more sense to
&gt; me than carrying a spare coil.

Well, that philosophy didn't do much good for the family I stopped to help
at the CA14/US395 junction a few years back.  Their coil was dead as a
doornail.  I didn't carry a coil in
those days and we hammered the 10 miles into Ridgecrest to try and find an
open parts store at 6:00PM on a Sunday.  We were lucky, we caught a guy
with his key in the lock and he was nice and opened back up for us.
Otherwise it would have been a long cold night in the Mojave.

A part in the hand is worth many in the parts store.
