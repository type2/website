Subject: Air-cooled Federal EGR filter and SMOG

Hi all:

The EGR filter on my '82 separated itself from the vehicle while the
California smog test was being performed!  Needless to say, I didn't pass the
test!

The filter is NLA from Volkwagen (surprise!) and Bus Depot doesn't carry them
and can't get them.  Ditto for the FLAPS.

I called California BAR and they gave me 3 numbers to call to see if I could
secure the part whereby I got quotes of: $145.00 for &quot;used&quot;, $197.50 for
&quot;reconditioned&quot;, $231.00 for &quot;new.&quot;  I bent over, grabbed my ankles and said
&quot;I'd like the new one Sir!&quot;

The (&quot;Test Only&quot;) station I took it to has a &quot;pass or free retest&quot; policy so
once I get the EGR filter hooked up I'm going back, fingers crossed.

As far as the tailpipe test goes I passed the HC and NO parts but failed the
CO test.

Numbers were:

HC
15 mph Maximum 204
15 mph Measured  62 Pass

25 mph Maximum 123
15 mph Measured  59 Pass

NO
15 mph Maximum 1486
15 mph Measured   431 Pass

25 mph Maximum 1346
15 mph Measured   251 Pass

CO

15 mph Maximum 1.46
15 mph Measured 1.54 Fail

25 mph Maximum 1.26
15 mph Measured 1.47 Fail

I did all the right things prior to the test: fresh oil, new premium gas,
timing spot on, long drive to get the engine completely warmed up before
hitting the test station.  After passing SMOG 2 years I figured I should pass
this time too - the vehicle sees very little driving - but I turned the CO
screw on the AFM a quarter turn counterclockwise prior to taking the test
under the theory that these vehicles tend to get richer as time goes on given
the AFM internal mechanism.  Since I have no way to test the exhaust itself
prior to going back I'm going to turn the screw a half-turn more
counterclockwise.  That's about the best I can do, unless someone has a better
idea.
