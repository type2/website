Subject: suggestion for the archives - was Re: [T2] INFO IN THE ARCHIVES

A suggestion on how to improve the archives would be to include some of 
the message content in the search results.  I notice that there is alot 
of header information in the results that forces you to open each and 
every message to see what it's about.  Is there a way to easily make the 
search engine skip the header and display the body in the search results?

I know I'd love to use the archives but I never do because finding 
anything is a beast.  Has there been thought to use google as the search 
engine?  I thought they have a system that allows people to use their 
engine without subscribing to their service.  This might help to make 
the archives used more and send less repeat traffic to the list...

&gt; When I have a question I hit the excellent T2 library first, and also
&gt; attempt to wade into the archives (not to mention my Bentley, Haynes and
&gt; Idjot's Guide), but really find the T2 archives difficult and time consuming
&gt; to navigate.  I once asked for assistance/tips on how to best utilize the
&gt; archive (which went unanswered) however a simple &quot;how to&quot; guide posted in
&gt; the archive link for best retrieving this great wealth of info would be most
&gt; helpful for the less compoodur literate.  It would save time and frustration
&gt; for the questionee and save on annoying and repetitive posts to fellow
&gt; listees.
