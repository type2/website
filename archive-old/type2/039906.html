Subject: Looking for 73 dual pot dizzy's (don't need vacum)

My bus want to hold back about 45 mph. Local shop suggested I advance the 
.009, but better yet go back to original. The original's guts are not in good 
shape. The part that the springs from the magnets is bent (it could be 
straighten out), but there are a two flat very thin gasket and washer that 
broke up. Where do you get those, and are they needed?

I think maybe a working distr. would be better as I have the vacuum.

Thanks, Tom
