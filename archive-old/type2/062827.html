Wow, quite a story. Thanks.

Dad had a rather interesting problem getting out of a van, back in 1970. 
I got the story second hand, and the details changed with each telling. 
This is what happened, as close as I can figure out.

Dad was coming home one night, late, driving the &quot;normal&quot; 60 to 70 mph, 
and something caused the van to go out of control (I think it was a hard 
gust of wind). He had just passed a semi, and the wheel spun clear to 
the right peg. He shot across the freeway in front of the semi, and up 
the right embankment. As the van exited the road, a side marker caught 
the bumper and punched out the right turn signal. Dad hit the floor.

Watching from the floor, with his hip on the accelerator, the van rolled 
to its right side. He looked up to see the wheel spin wildly, pegging 
clear left. Getting traction, the van lept to its wheels, and careened 
back across the freeway, just behind the tractor trailer, and across the 
medium strip. The van continued across the other side of the road, just 
narrowly being missed by a station wagon (it didn't slow, or even 
swerve... he must have been asleep at the wheel). Dad couldn't reach the 
keys, so he shoved the van out of gear, and it came to rest on the side 
of the road. 

Now, with the engine revving close to its max RPMs (how long does it 
take to blow a 1500cc?), and gas fumes filling the van, dad rolled 
off the accelerator, seeking an exit. He first tried both front doors, 
but they were solidly wedged, then he jumped into the back. The hinges 
on the side doors were crushed inward, so both side doors were wedged 
closed. He was beginning to panic, because gas fumes were quite strong 
inside. Dad never did like the VW van (although he was the one who 
bought it), and he couldn't think of anything more horrendous than 
burning to death in it. Go figure!

He had the pressence of mind to shut off the engine. The semi truck's 
driver had arrived by now, and was tried to open the doors. The rear 
hatch was locked, so pushing the button had no effect. The side doors 
were also locked with a key, so they wouldn't turn, and the bumper 
(deluxe model) had bent upward, so the corners were holding both doors 
closed.

Finally dad came to something like a right mind, and he unlatched the 
side doors, lying on the middle seat, he kicked the side doors 
open.

I assume, after the adrenilin wore off, he drove the van home, but it 
may have been towed. After a wash job, the damage was amazingly 
superfecial. The right front turn signal was busted out, from a perfect 
shot by the marker, the front bumper brackets were bent, as was the 
right front side hinge. There were no dents I could detect, although the 
paint may have been worn through on the right side (or it could have 
been dirt). As far as I know, the only paint needed was on the bumper 
(w/ a very small dent), and to the doors where dad tried to open them... 
and the bumper cut the paint. 

No &quot;noticable damage&quot;, but trapped inside. I think I'll go for the short 
bumpers, if I have a choice.
