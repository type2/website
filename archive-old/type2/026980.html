I'd like to extend a big thanks to all who responded to my 
bucking/hesatating question.
I replaced the fuel filter on monday and checked all the cylinder head temp. 
sensor connections, but there was no great improvement.  So I moved on to a 
new temp. sensor, and thank goodness that was the problem!  I wasn't looking 
forward to potential AFM, or larger FI problems.

&quot;The Fudge&quot; is now running like a champ again, so you all better watch your 
rear view mirrors for a smooth looking brown vanagon gainin' on ya.

Thanks again, and thanks for the list!
