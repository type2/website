&gt; &gt;Hey, if I can beat Gensler's Porsche-powered bus
&gt; through first 
&gt; &gt;and second, I can beat you guys too.  Bring it on! 
&gt; :)
&gt; 
&gt; David, you just got lucky and caught me with my RPM
&gt; down!  And let's clarify:  
&gt; it was YOUR first and second gear you got through -
&gt; I had just shifted to 
&gt; second (at 33 mph) where my power really comes on. 
&gt; And when I hit 3rd at 55 
&gt; mph, watch out!
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I know there are some other closet racers out there
&gt; - So who wants 
&gt; &gt;to help set up the first annual type2 drag race in
&gt; the Central US?  
&gt; &gt;I'll bring my spare CV joints...
&gt; 
 OK GUYS,    Keep it up and I will have to bring my
chopped loaf 454 mid engin with flameing crome pipes
out both sides. How many buses have you seen that can
pull the wheels off the ground at 3000rpm. Rat fink
lives again.     Wayne
