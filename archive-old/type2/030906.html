&gt; Hi folks, yes I need a fuel sender unit, I took mine out and the 
&gt; little wires were torn, I need the kind that turns into place, not 
&gt; the one with the 5 bolts to hold it on... thank you sooo much folks!


I just got one from the Bus Depot,  got tired of messing with the old
ones, broke down and bought a new one
