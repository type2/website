&gt; Busfolk,
&gt; 
&gt; As some of you know, my buslife was left in shambles when my bus refused to start after a Busma-generating replacement of all fuel lines.
&gt; 
&gt; Many responded, some saying pour a shot of gasoline into the plenum, others saying take a shot of gasoline yourself, gargle, and read the Bentley.
&gt; 
&gt; As it were, my double relay was left flopping around like crazy, and I could not figure out why.
&gt; 
&gt; I appealed to Karl, who lives nearby, for some telephone assitance, and Sunday morning, his 77 deluxe westy purred smoothly up to my curb.
&gt; 
&gt; In 25 minutes he found the disco'd ground wire which was causing my &quot;major malfunction&quot;. The ground was the one on the casebolt, which is the main ground for the FI computer, obviously causing major problems. Out of sight under the air plenum, it was out of mind as well. Something that could have been found easily, but in the process, I learned much about my engine.
&gt; 
&gt; Futhermore, Karl helped me deal with some vacuum issues, diagnosed a failing decel valve, informed me on correct timing, notified me of incorrect coil (elec. inj.), and provided infinite knowledge of things Teuto-Mechanical as we strolled the junkyard.
&gt; 
&gt; So my bus is running again, I have learned much, and made the acquaintance of a fine listmember/busdriver.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks to all on the list, Dave B., Chuck W., Richard A., The Dok, Karl especially, and anyone I've forgotten. 
&gt; 
&gt; Busdrivin' pays off again.
&gt;
