Yes, Simple Green is 'enviro-friendly', until you contaminate it with
petroleum products.  Just try washing your engine on the lawn and see how long
it takes for the brown spot to heal. BTDT. I use Diesel and recycle.

&gt; &gt; I read kerosene, gasoline, &quot;solvent&quot; (too generic a

&gt; &gt; go about eliminating the waste?
