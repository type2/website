Hi Travis
Growing up in SOCAL  spent many a day in Baja. Two biggest probs gas and
tires.
PEMEX stations can be few and far between the further down you get. The gas
has an octane just above water. Bring spare jerry cans , spare gas filters
(imagin an Arco with a hand pump in a dirt lot), octane booster, oil (beer is
easier to find)spare tires,and anything else you would need if you were in the
middle of nowhere, which of course is where you'll be as soon as you pass
Ensenada. Drive slow and watch for burro carts you pass as the trucks pass
you. Buy ins before you cross the border and no guns, it pisses off the
federales who carry machine guns.I allways carry a few bucks for minor traffic
offences(dosn't happen, try 3 diff times in 3 diff vehicles). Remember your a
guest and you'll have a great time. Need any info feel free to email me
