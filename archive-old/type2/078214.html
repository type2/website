Subject: Crazy Camper Question

This is crazy, but...  Anybody out there know of any conversions or good
how-to's for the roof of the campers?  Here's the deal:  I have found what
seems to be a very good deal on a '70, pretty good shape, needs a few of the
panels worked on, but runs great.  -Will need a clutch soon, but that is no
big thing either.  I have always wanted a bus, just not a camper.  The roof
just does not fit into the style bus I see myself with in the end.
-However it is not likely that I'll find an equally good deal on any other
VW.  $400 in this case.  So, I'd like to make it a rag top, or just fill it
in.  I'm sure I could fabricate something to &quot;patch the roof&quot; and welding is
okay for me.  But if there is a known solution, I'd certainly like to get
the info before my purchase on Friday.  Any help or comments are greatly
appreciated.

Thanks,

Bryan Castles
