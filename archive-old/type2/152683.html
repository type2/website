Subject: Re: [T2] Adjusting brake rod length when replacing power
  booster in a mid to late bay

When you do access your Bentley, go to Section 8, Page 6

Essentially and as quoted from Bentley: &quot;the connecting rod should not
exert pressure on the servo valve housing when the brake pedal is all
the way up&quot;.  You basically adjust the connecting rod to this
standard.

Further quoted: &quot;Because the length of the one-piece pushrod in the
servo is fixed, it's clearance with the master cylinder cannot change.
 Adjusting the connecting rod (above) so that it does not exert
pressure on the servo valve ensures that the servo pushrod is fully
retracted to maintain proper clearance. Because close tolerances are
maintained during manufacture, the master cylinder or the servo can be
replaced without upsetting the clearance between the servo pushrod and
the master cylinder piston&quot;.

See also Figure 4.4 on that page showing a photo of the connecting rod.

&gt; I haven't looked in Bentley yet because it's in the bus in my garage and
&gt; I'm at work.
&gt;
&gt; how does one go about adjusting the length of the shaft that connects the
&gt; bottom of the pedal to the front of the booster to the correct length? I do
&gt; have a power bleeder so I should be able to bleed the brakes before
&gt; adjusting the push rod length. Is there a procedure/measurement or do I
&gt; just adjust it until it &quot;feels right&quot;?
