Hi Steve, Beth

I can virtually guarantee both seats contain 0% horsehair. (Unless Beth
added some!)

The seat I used as a driver was rebuilt using 2 layers of some very stiff
carpet underlay as padding. I would do it again that way with the same
material but next time around I would use a softer underlay for the outer
layer. The other seat was rebuilt with the softer &amp; thicker polyester foam
from my ex-73 Z-bed; carved into shape with a serrated kitchen knife. That
one looked a bit over-stuffed, but I'm told it was a comfy ride.

I actually thought of the same response as Dave W; but decided against
posting it. I did laugh when I read it though; it's what I would have told
my kids to do.

Sure wish *I* could make the HCBF, but not this year. Maybe in 2003.
Meanwhile I am looking forward  to seeing folks this weekend at Buses By the
Falls, and later this summer at Buses Of the Corn!

Happy trails,

  &gt; Beth, Jon, Gregg,
  &gt; 
  &gt; I am rolling!  Very funny!!!  I am glad it has worked out as well as it
  &gt; did :-)  I hope to see you all at High Country!!!
  &gt; 
  &gt;&gt;&gt; Ok, my four year old daughter left a lollipop on the front passenger
  &gt;&gt;&gt; seat of my 78 bus and it melted into the cloth upholstery.  True, it
is
  &gt;&gt;&gt; my fault; I should not have given her the lolli, but these seats are
new
  &gt;&gt;&gt; to me, given to me at Everybus 2002 by some nice guy whose name I
  &gt;&gt;&gt; forget, and I want to get this junk off my seat!  Any suggestions?
  &gt; 
  &gt; Beth,
  &gt; 
  &gt; It is *very* easy to get the cover off the seat and soak it.  It also
  &gt; washes in a machine quite well with no detectable shrinkage  Getting the
  &gt; sugar out of the foam/horshair may be worse (*don't* soap the horsehair
  &gt; (if you have any left)), but it is sugar, and thus water soluble.
