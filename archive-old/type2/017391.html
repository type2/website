&gt; Mark,         You can adjust # 1 exhaust and intake, and # 2 intake, and
&gt; then adjust the # 4 exhaust.  Then after flywheel rotation of 360
&gt; degrees, adjust # 3 exhaust and intake, # 4 intake, then adjust the # 2
&gt; exhaust.  Valves can be reduce to a 2 part adjustment in this way.
&gt;            I've diagrammed it this way in my manual.  Remember, sitting
&gt; in your bus left is left, etc.

Kevin:
While in theory you can adjust the intake valve while the exhaust of the
same cylinder is open (as your plan says) it works much better on a
chevy than a VW boxer motor. The reason for this is that the rocker
shafts deflect and show more apparent lash, so you end up making a few
valves too tight. (Not a problem where each rocker is independently
supported.) At least that's what I noticed in my 78 (W/ early type 4 cam
and solids). I'd set em to 6 and 8 and then re-check and they'd be too
tight!
