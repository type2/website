Subject: alternator problem

hey all,

Edna's alternator doesn't work, well it works sorta. I have no red light on
the dash, good, the engine keeps running if i disconnect the + battery
terminal, good, but it slows down when i do that, bad?  if i go out for a
drive and stop somewhere, the battery will be too dead to start the engine.
that's a 2.0L FI 1977 type IV if that matters.


the main question i have is where does the wire from the alternator with the
plastic push on go??

thanks again,
