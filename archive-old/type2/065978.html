Subject: Alternate Power?

Hey All, 

a while back i was looking for a possible alternative power source for my 
bus.  I ran across an intesting set up VW had made for a Hybrid VW bus.
The way it worked (as far as i understand) the engine served as a 
generator while an electric motor, hooked up to the front of the tranny, 
propelled the vehicle forward. When the load for the electric motor was 
too great the gas motor would kick in and help power it....
 This sounds like a great idea and was wondering if anyone had heard of 
this... AND  this hybrid bus was released in Europe and not sure if it 
was released here (U.S), and if parts are still availiable.......

any ways 

I also have another question. I'm planning a cross country trip starting 
from CA to back east .... any info on 
1. what to bring on this sorta trip 
2. Cost?
3. suggest route cross country and back....
and
4. anything else that i have forgotten.....

Anything would help.....

Thanx
