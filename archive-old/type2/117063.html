  Converts-now long Mexican bus story

The trouble is, John can use it right now with his dealer plate. I don't 
think it will go cheap even if you can prove that it can't be legally 
registered.

Hmmm, ok, so I live in a state resembling that remark...so they folks
who have this bus need to sell it to me cheap!...and I will try to get it 
registered.

George, Don't forget about those places down in Alabama or Georgia 
someplace that will get you a title for $xx in less than 30 days.

Cheers, dave
