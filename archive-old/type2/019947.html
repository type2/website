Subject: Thermostat temp?
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

My nosy neighbor, (bless his twisted little soul!) couldn't help himself
from crawling under Sally's newly washed and ramped rear end, wherein he
discovered the thermostat cable to be off its' little wheel-like guide. 
Being the brute that he is, he insisted on &quot;fixing&quot; it - by attempting
to pull the cable onto the guide without loosening the termination.  Of
course the cable snapped.

Now all this is good - because it forced me to then deal with the
thermostat.  I happened to have some bike cables, and one was just very
slightly thicker than the original, so I attached it to the old cable to
snake it up to the engine attachment.  All good there.  Any comments on
using this cable?

Then I went to Bentley, where it states:

&quot;149 to 158 F should cause the dimension to be at least 46mm&quot;

This thermostat was toast.  So, I went to my local BUGFORMANCE - in
Sunnyvale, and got a replacement.  Being the curious soul that I am, I
tested the new thermometer.

It was WAY off.  I borrowed my neighbor's thermometers to check my own,
and no matter how you cut it, this thermstat opens 15 degrees hotter
than the spec.

While looking for correct plug gap in the specs tables, I happened to
notice an interesting thing:

Thermostat (thru Sept '72)  149 - 158 F
Thermostat (from Oct '72)   185 - 194 F

Ah-hah!  So, I called BUGFORMANCE with the news that they were doing
customers such as myself a disservice by selling me the wrong part.  The
fella (as usual, I've never been impressed with their concern over
anything) was unconcerned, and babbled something about &quot;perhaps my
bentley was out of date&quot; - yeh, I'm sure they changed specs...

So, I need your wisdom!  The manufacture date of the vehicle is May '72,
but the engine is a replacement 914 1700, exact date unknown.  Should I
insist on the cooler thermostat?  Is that 15 degrees negligible in this
context?

Thanks, bussers!

Teri
