Subject: GEX

Hey,
I've been reading some of the things posted on the list about GEX.  All of 
them have been bad comments.  I was looking at there website b/c I need a 
new engine for my bus. After what I heard I don't think I will buy from them 
but could someone tell where I could get a good 2 liter from for my 72 bus.

Thank You
Jon
