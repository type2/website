&gt; My noise would indeed be a clunk, clunk, clunk, clunk - in time to the spinning tire...
&gt;
&gt; I replaced the really chewed up drivers side outer joint because it would make a repeated clunk when I
&gt; turned left hard.  This new replacement joint just clunks all the freakin' time, even when I'm going
&gt; straight ahead.  Needless to say, I'm not driving the bus except to test it out...
&gt;
&gt; Can I clarify what you're telling me in your email below?  Jack up just one tire, block all other wheels,
&gt; start car without emergency brake engaged, put bus in first gear, then let out clutch??  Won't this send
&gt; me flying off the jack stands, blocks or no blocks?  Would it make more sense to jack up BOTH wheels?
&gt;
&gt; And you're saying have a buddy in the bus to hit the brakes when/if needed, but I stay outside and peer
&gt; into the cv joint vicinity to see exactly where the clunk is coming from?  Sounds a little hairy.
&gt;
&gt; I don't want to die for a clunk, y'know?

Just make sure that the bus will go in the other direction!

Have you checked for wheel bearing problems?  Bearing noise occurs at the same
frequency as CV noise.
