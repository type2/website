Subject: RE: [T2] Tach-&gt; Red-Line/Idle/Wiring

Richard/John,

Thank you both for your reply and info!  Both numbers are key for me... I
think that 4200 is a good number to work with as an orange-line - an RPM not
to normally exceed... it's good to know that I'm &quot;safe&quot; to 5400 if needed.
Now to find some orange and red tape for the tach so I (and the wife) don't
forget.

Wayne

&gt;I've heard for longevity not to go over 4200 when not needed.

The stock Type 4 engine doesn't really want to accelerate much after that
RPM so 4200 would be better redline to keep the engine to rather than the
factory spec I listed.
