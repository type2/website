&gt; Does anyone use a small (airbrush) compressor to clean parts, blow out

yes and no, it will do some of the smaller jobs, forget painting though
the presure is not uniform need a tank for that, now I have a small low
presure tank that I have used to do SMALL touch ups with.  the biggest
problem is they are not usually designed for continous opperation so they
will overheat if run too long, (although in a pinch I have blown up a tire
with it, time consumeing but possible.)
