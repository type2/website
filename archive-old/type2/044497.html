andy sends:

&gt; A T1 engine in a late bus or vanagon was stock in europe and done
&gt; correctly is maybe underpowered but certainly as reliable as the T1 engine
&gt; in other vehicles except for perhaps a slightly shortened service life to
&gt; to pushing a heavier load.

The question is, was it the *same* engine? Or did they beef it up for longer
service life?
