&gt; Well it can't be all that bad, since women apply it directly to their

&gt; Now you are speaking to a histologist, microscopist, and
&gt; inventor/putterer who unwillingly had to consult a dermatologist.

&gt; Women should apply acetone to their nails, not their skin.  Yes, nails
&gt; are technically skin, but much more densely crosslinked.  PS; superglue
&gt; is good for temp. binding of a badly ripped nail.

And, it is used to attach acrylic fingernails!

No, I'm not saying that one should use a lot of acetone.  However, many
women use it on a daily basis to remove nail polish and when they do so
they use it with no special protection for their bare fingers.  They get
as much contact with their skin as they get with their nails.

That is quite a difference from stuff like benzine or MEK which are a lot
nastier!  I wouldn't touch that stuff without nitrile gloves and positive
flow ventilation.
