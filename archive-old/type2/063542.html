&gt;I finally got around to adding the 35psi - 40psi of air pressure to my

&gt;moving.  Is there a way to adjust the jet so it hits a correct angle. 
I haven't got around to fixing my washer yet so I'm not 100% sure, but
I think that yes, you can move the jet.  I think you just use a pin or
similar to rotate the jet to the desired position.  I think it's a small
ball-and-socket arrangement, with a hole in the &quot;ball&quot; part where the
fluid comes out.  You rotate the ball so that the hole is pointing where
you want it.
