Subject: Starter wire gauge?

I've got my motot out (for a clutch replacement which was relatively 
painless;)) and noticed the starter wire was bare. It looks as though PO may 
have tried to jump the battery with the cables crossed and burnt off all of 
the insulation off the starter wire. I don't wan't to buy this part from 
VWoA, so I'm gonna try and make my own. What gauge wire should I use, and if 
anyone has done this before, what do I need to be careful of? Thanks in 
advance
