Jim

I agree with the below, and will add one point that hasn't been touched on
in favor of the 1968-71 (and '72='74 but with different engine) models --
the interior design. Although the refinements of the 75-79 seem to make
sense--gas/electric fridge, built-in stove, etc., it has never felt as right
pr as natural as the 68-73 configuration. I admit it may simply be a
personal preference, but I like setting up the camp stove near the door, not
cooking inside the bus. As someone else observed, who wants to cook bacon
inside a bus?

Also, the old manual water spigot and ice-box cooler are less finicky, But I
suggest you look at various configurations and come to the conclusion that
is right for you, including air-cooled and water-cooled Vanagons.

For a pretty good guide to various model tears buses you may wish to check
out the Bus Depot's buyer's guide to campers at
http://www.busdepot_dot_com/campers.htm

Best of luck an whatever you decide. You will find this list and all the
friendly people on it to be a tremendous resource.

&gt; Say Jim, do you want some company? Just wishing, really sounds like a good
&gt; idea today.
&gt;
&gt;     I agree with Bob, except on year models. I would keep it to the 1968
to
&gt; 1971 models, the 71 being the most appealing, IMHO because of the front
disk
&gt; brakes. There are several other reasons for chousing the 68 thru 71 years.
&gt; I'll list a few, again IMHO:
&gt;
&gt; Disk brakes, stronger, straighter fade free stops.
&gt;
&gt; 1600 engine, cheap, reliable, ease to work on, parts availability almost
any
&gt; where, &quot;enough power&quot;, but not a race winner in a bus of course. Leave
early,
&gt; drive slow, and enjoy the ride! A New Mexican engine is available with HYD
&gt; lifter, and oil filter in the $1200.00 range. This will extend your
&gt; maintenance range somewhat, and eliminate valve adjustments. Sold out
right is
&gt; a plus also (no exchange needed). If you intend to build your own, start
with
&gt; a new case, rebuilt crankshaft, have your heads rebuilt by a good shop
using
&gt; new exhaust valves and guides. When the dust settles, you wont save much
money
&gt; building your own, but you will have the satisfaction!
&gt;
&gt; Transmission: Bull Dog Tough, you just cant kill one with out abusing it
(lack
&gt; of oil, running it in water, etc)
&gt;
&gt; &quot;NO&quot; gear reduction boxes, last made in 1967. Personally I like the look
of
&gt; the &quot;Splittys&quot; better, but I just don't care for the way they drive
compared
&gt; to the 68 thru 71's.
&gt;
&gt; Front end: Ball joints much softer ride, more precise &quot;Feel of the road&quot;,
&gt; easier to work on. There is a tendency for rust damage on the tubes, but
if
&gt; there isn't any at the time you buy, its easy to prevent with paint, rust
&gt; proofing, etc.
&gt;
&gt;     Now this is where I differ from Bob. I would go with the most simple
&gt; design I could get. Excluding the afore mentioned 1967 and earlier models.
Why
&gt; take a chance with expensive thirty year old fuel injection components,
plus
&gt; the 1700 thru 2000 cc engines are very expensive, and can be trouble some.
&gt; Plus they don't lend them selves to road side repair compared to a non
fuel
&gt; injection 1600.
&gt;
&gt; Cost: You can expect to pay some where between $500.00 for a re-builder,
to
&gt; $5000.00 for a slick bus. I would try and find a bus that is running and
in
&gt; use. This will eliminate a lot of potential ills, compared to one that has
&gt; been sitting for a long time.Check it out for rust damage, make sure the
&gt; transmission is in good shape.
&gt;     You may want to figure on a brake rebuild, including on new flex
hoses,
&gt; master cylinder, etc.
&gt;     You can see a lot of the wiring harness on a bus. Check for burnt
wires,
&gt; corrosion in the fuse box, water damage from leaking windshield, wiper
area.
&gt;
&gt;     Buy as you would any used car, have it looked at by an experienced
&gt; Volkswagen shop, and remember:
&gt;
&gt; NEVER BUY AT NIGHT........NEVER BUY IN THE RAIN........... NEVER BUY (OR
SELL
&gt; FOR THAT MATTER) FROM FAMILY.............REMEMBER YOU CAN WALK AWAY, ITS
NOT
&gt; THE ONLY ONE LEFT.........and the main
&gt; one......................................................
&gt; ...............................LET THE BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
&gt;
&gt;     Good luck, keep us posted on the bus. And for all us Lesser men, Wife
&gt; bound Yes Dear types, bills up the Kazoo, a running account of the trip
would
&gt; be fun!
&gt;
&gt; Have fun,
