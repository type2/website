Unfortunately, I have to sell my bus. It's not a finance issue, but a 
landlord issue :( So, I am interested in finding someone that will treat her 
right, moreso than the selling price.

The members of this list have provided me with so much help over the last 
few years I figured I would post here first. If a member of the list can 
give my bus a good home I will let you have it cheap. Otherwise I will end 
up selling it to someone locally and who knows what will happen to her.

1979 Westy - poptop
I bought her in spring of 1999 from the original owner.
~70,000 original miles

Things I have done:
- AVP 2.0 engine ( now has &lt; 20,000miles)
- new clutch and throw-out
- new clutch cable
- new accel cable
- new oil cooler
- new tires (reinforced sidewalls)
- new calipers
- new CV joints (all four)
- new kyb shocks front and rear
- new fuel pump
- new alternator
- temp and oil pressure gauges
- replaced all fuel lines and filter
- replaced AFM
I've replaced other things as well...

I also have an *almost* complete FI system as spare parts that will go with 
the bus.

(Ron _at_ the Bus Depot can vouch for all the parts I have purchased!)

If you are interested shoot me an email or give me a call: (205) 939-3302

This is a good bus that someone that cares about busses needs to own.

Rob
