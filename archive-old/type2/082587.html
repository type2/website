Subject: We Lost One...

  Alas, the ranks of air-cooled drivers just lost another member to the &quot;real car&quot; world. This weekend, one of my close friends and bus brothers, rescuers, and adventurers put his '71 and '60 buses into storage and bought a S*t*rn coupe. He was lured away by those shiny promises of speed, heat, and reliability that seem so far from a bus, but even he admits that a little part of him died as he left the car lot. It seems that more and more people are finding it easier to swallow a monthly payment over adjusting valves or doing some other maintenance or repair in the freezing cold, or rain. I'm pretty fortunate in that I actually ride a bike as my work commuter vehicle, but the crew cab and the bus are my only vehicles for shopping, errands, and road trips. Would my perspective change if I spent an hour or two each day in the bus stuck in traffic? Who knows... And as I look out my front door at home and see the two empty parking spaces, the street seems a little darker, a little!
 less spe
cial...
But wait, that means that there's room for me to bring home two more! Wahoo!
The circle continues, one way or another.
