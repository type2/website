That part numbers would imply a Mann filter. Commonly fit to Audi/VW  
diesels.

&gt; I hadn't done the oil myself
&gt; before, so I suspect the place I brought it to (some independent shop
&gt; down the block) used that rather than the proper filter.  Could using
&gt; the wrong filter have led to it blowing out?

Possible. The average VW diesel might use 5w30 vs. the heavier oil  
(20w50?) that you might be using.
