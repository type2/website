FWIW

&gt; I have the solution, although I haven't sized it up to see if it would
&gt; work.

this is all based on my BA-4 so somethings might be different

&gt; As I mentioned earlier, it seems the heater is designed to be installed
&gt; ABOVE the fuel tank.  Installing it in the cabin is probably not best,
&gt; and I'm not sure how loud the thing is, but this is the plan:
&gt;
&gt; Install the heater in the closet and put a false bottom in above it.
&gt; Run the exhaust into the rear wheel well (as in the beetle front wheel
&gt; well).  Combustion air would be drawn from the engine compartment,
&gt; fresh air from the rear of the cabin.  Heated air would be ducted down
&gt; the front of the wheel well (through the closet) and out underneath the
&gt; closet door.  Fuel return line would be routed into the gas filler
&gt; neck.  I don't know yet where I would put the switch - perhaps by the
&gt; warm air outlet.

mine is installed under the front pan where the A/C evaporator was
formally installed.  I recirculate the air using the old A/C blower
mounted in the stock glove box location. take air in there blow thru new
ducts in the floor thru the heater and then back into the stock duct above
the front beam.  fuel is run in a tube along a frame rail,  exhaust is run
forward and exhausted facing rearward at the edge of the front bumper into
the slip stream

&gt; My stock heater works fine, but is good only for the cockpit, really.

I have no stock heater at all.   and unless I get my heater reinstalled
before it gets cold I won't have any heat at all.  had to remove it to get
to the front beam for some repair work.
