Subject: Re: [T2] FI Pressure Regulator - Good Link, Sorry

Hello,

The picture that you showed is your cold start valve.
I replaced the one on my bus. everything around it
seems to be saturated with gasoline. I would probably
clean it up to get all the grime off of it first,
tighten all of the clamps and the 2 screws. If it
still leaks after that, the seal between the valve and
air plenum may be shot. If so, replace. I had to make
one out of ruber gasket material. I would definitely
check those ruber hoses and make sure they are new. If
there is any doubt, replace them. The last thing I can
think of is if you think the valve is leaking a round
its seams, then you will have to buy a new one. They
are sold at Busdepot. Good Luck and have a great Day!

Regards,

David Kelly

&gt; It appears that I have fuel (not a lot) loose around
&gt; the pressure
&gt; regulator.  It looks like it's equally on both sides
&gt; of the
&gt; regulator...  Has my regulator gone?  Do these
&gt; clamps work loose?
