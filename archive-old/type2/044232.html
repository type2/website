&gt; I took a small road trip this past weekend to test the 77 2L engine that I

&gt; I mentioned a pretty good oil leak when hot.

Well, since it's the oil pressure that's suffering, the oil leak shoud get
first attention.  Perhaps you've got a gallery plug popped partially out
which is letting the pressure out.  I wouldn't run the engine again until
you have traced the leak.

You should also check the pressure relief and control valves to be sure
that they are free.

The oil pressure sender is also a suspect.  Sometimes they're just
incorrect.
