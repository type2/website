my first guess is he got some really bad gas...

drain tank fill with fresh gas, run the engine for a bit might even have
to use some engine starter to get her going..

&gt; David Cook is stuck at a truck stop somewhere in southern Montana with
&gt; a 78 FI bus that just wont start.
&gt; On his way from KC to the Yukon ...
&gt;
&gt; After a fuel fillup the bus seemed to hesitate and run poorly, he has
&gt; done much of the obvious, checked and changed fuel filters, some
&gt; injector cleaner aswell as run some &quot;evaporator&quot; for water. The kicker
&gt; is that he stopped the bus and found a vac leak in his brake booster
&gt; lin, patched it and when he tried to start his bus it wouldnt start.
&gt; After waiting a while she sparked up and again ran hesitantly and
&gt; crappily for awhile longer.
&gt;
&gt; Now he has stopped and again the bus wont start, runs like crap and he
&gt; cant figure out what is going wrong. The starter cranks, he has spark
&gt; at the coil, the plugs arent fouled, his sensor on #3 us connected ...
&gt;
&gt; He seems to have covered many of the bases that seem obvious. I am of
&gt; little to no help being a carb'ed man and not knowing a thing about FI.
&gt;
&gt; SO here is my call to anyone who has experienced this before, HELP !
&gt;
&gt; David's cell number is 785-806-0254 so if anyone is either in the area
&gt; or has ANY tips give him a call or e-mail me.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Steve
