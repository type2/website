&gt; How do you folks determine how much torque you have on the castellated nuts

Well, I have an 18&quot; bar for my big socket.  I weigh ~200lbs and if I stand
on the end of the bar, that's 300 foot/punds

&gt; I know I can guess with the length of the breaker bar and cheater bar
&gt; combined times the weight on the end, but frankly it worries me because you
&gt; never really know how much weight your putting on that thing.  Your either

All of it! Seriously, the way to run big torques if you don't have a big
torque wrench is to know your weight and put all of it on the breaker bar.  
The way you vary the torque is to vary the distance from the center of
effort. It is a foot/pound because it is 1 pound of force applied 1 foot
from the center of the fastener.  To get 300 foot/pounds of torque, you
can:
apply 600 pounds 6 inches from the center or 
apply 300 pounds 1 foot from the center or 
apply 150 pounds 2 feet from the center or 
apply 100 pounds 3 feet from the center or....

Your 50 pound kid can torque a 300 ft/lb nut, they just need to hang on
the end of a 6 foot breaker bar :-)
