Subject: Re: [T2] Front / Rear cabin dividers?

I think there's M-codes for most of these, and it looks like there
were options for the metal partition behind the front seat to be full
width, behind each seat, behind the driver's seat only, or not there
at all.  My 77 doesn't have any metal partition behind the seats - if
you take out the front seats, it's one big unobstructed box except for
the front wheel wells and the engine compartment.

Some examples from VW Transporter and Microbus Specification Guide 1967-1979:

M-code 690 - Passenger seat in cabin as swivelling seat, without metal
partition behind this seat - 211, 221, 231, 234, 1976-1979
M-code 500 - Full-width metal partition between cabin and load
compartment 21-23, all years
M-code 331 - Without metal division between cabin and cargo
compartment, passenger seat adjustable on rails 211, 231, 1976-1979

I think there was a model-year change as well - M-code 331 only
applies to kombis and panel vans, but my microbus doesn't have the
divider.  I think that was the stock configuration for the 76-79
microbus.

&gt; I'm really curious how VW decided what they were going to do, and what models
&gt; got what??? It doesn't APPEAR to be anything year specific from what I can
&gt; tell...???
