Subject: Re: [T2] Desperately needing alignment '70 bus

&gt;      Over the weekend I replaced rear torsion bars/bushings/bearings. As a
&gt; result, of course the alignment is off on the rear end of the bus. In
&gt; the past I've taken the bus to NTB to have the alignment done. Now
&gt; with their new nifty  alignment machine, they say they can't adjust
&gt; the rear. I show them the Bentley and they stand around and shake
&gt; their heads. Two shops have told me that it can't even be
&gt; adjusted--which we know to be incorrect.

Hmmmm, NTB did mine not that long ago, seemed to be a new machine but
didn't ask. they just did it and charged me $20 or so.
