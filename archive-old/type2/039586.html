Subject: Re: Sliding door runner maintenance/lubrication

&gt; The question is: What's the best stuff to use to put on the door runner for
&gt; lubrication.  I don't want brown streaks re-appearing and I don't want to
&gt; remove the cover again.  Would petroleum jelly Vaseline do the trick?  As
&gt; it's &quot;clear&quot; perhaps it won't brown as ordinary grease.  Any tips on long
&gt; term maintenance/lubrication would be welcome.

Don't know where I heard this but white lithium grease is probably your best
bet.  My door was not moving very smoothly and I applied this stuff one time
and have had no problems since.  This stuff doesn't ever seize up and is
completely water resistant.  I got mine at a bicycle repair shop.  they use
it to seal bottom brackets and ball bearings on their bikes because it is
waterproof.  Plus it is white so if it ever gets really dirty you can see
the dirt hence making it easy to see when it is necessary to reapply.  Hope
this helps.
