Subject: Re: Best defense is a brush paint job

No problem! I've met a lot of VW folks that proudly display their rust
like heroic war medals.
They just keep changing duct tape from season to season and accept that
they are driving the best deal they ever had.
You wouldn't believe the number of free Vanagons and Bays that I've just
turned down because I just can't stand ugly (looking in the mirror every
morning is the exception that a accept).
I know a parts van when I see one and I've crushed plenty of Vanagons in
the last eight years.
A local car dealer advertised an 81 Vanagon for $1500.00, I offered him
$200.00, in defense he said he had an offer for $600.00. Its still
sitting there after a month, its time for me to go offer $220.00 for it.

&gt; My anti car-jack defense lies in my brush paint job and lack of a 
&gt; headliner.
