Subject: re:tell us about YOUR heat

In my '65 I installed a southwind gas heater. The existing heat worked ok in
my bus if I shut the curtains behind my front seats. When it got closer to
30 it would work less well, so I installed the gas heater. The problem with
it, is that it sends the heat to the back of the bus. I have seen set ups
where folks run a dryer vent type flexible duct up to the front of the bus
with this same heater. I'm sure that works great.

 

I think the big issue is insulation, as the best heater won't work too well
if you have a leaky drafty bus. It is the same as your house. I know my bus
is super drafty, all the camper windows leak air. So until those are sealed,
I don't imagine the heater to work as good as it could.

 

This heater supposedly kicks out 20,000 BTU's, and uses about 1/3 gal per
hour when operating. I have thought it would be nice to use in cold weather
camping, but I also keep a CO detector in my bus, just in case.

 

I'm not sure what the electrical drain on my system is, and not sure if I
used it while camping over night-would I have trouble starting in the
morning?

 

My new '69 has the heater boxes disconnected from the heat ducts that run to
the front. The bellows are missing that connect the heater box to the tube
that runs front to back. I was wondering if I could just use some paper
tubing to connect these.anyone know if this would work, or why it wouldn't
work? I don't understand what those bellows are supposed to do.

 

Enjoy your Friday.
