Subject: Steel wagon wheels on a loaf?

I'm ashamed to admit I was browsing through a HotVW
and saw some wagon wheels like the ones I'd seen on a
bus.  Is the &quot;4 lug&quot; style mentioned (for baja
beetles) the same size as ours.  Do they fit a bus? 
Anyone run them?  Are they stronger?  Or perhaps just
wider (15&quot; x 5&quot;).  Anybody run these?
