Subject: That part I need...

Hello all,

I'm back after nearly two years. We moved to Mexico and there is lots to tell
concerning VW's!

But first, for my '76 Kombi (built in Canada) I'm looking for the part that
might be called something like a &quot;positve vacuum valve&quot;.
I can't get the correct name. It feeds to the fuel regulator, or in other
words, the fuel regulator can't function without this part. What is happening
since the fuel retgulator can't work is that my left over fuel is not sent
back to the gas tank. Instead it goes out my tailpipe as dark fumes, thereby
using up more gas than I need to.

Does anyone know the correct name of this and does anyone have one for sale?

Thanks!

Dan Ferguson

76 Kombi
75 Beetle (Bocho in Mexico)

P.S. We live in a town called San Miguel de Allende and there are more
&quot;Things&quot; (Safari's down here) here than you'll ever see in your life times up
north.
