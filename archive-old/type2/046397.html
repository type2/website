Subject: RE: [T2] Is this happening to you?

Well, we choose to drive around in an archetypal symbol of kinder analog
times. I do it because it makes me feel like that. Other people like to be
reminded too. I reckon that it indicates the removal of a nice comfort zone
from our culture and all these people want it back. Lucky us.

Driving my split around town gets me the slack-jawed
&gt; gapers and the
&gt; occasional compliments, last week some guy in a &quot;Trans-Am&quot; gave
&gt; me the peace
&gt; sign....&quot;oh ick&quot;. I suppose they mean well, on the other hand
&gt; maybe they're
&gt; just being smart asses.
&gt; Sometimes I enjoy the &quot;when I was a kid, I drove across the rockies in one
&gt; of those...&quot; when I'm buying gas, and sometimes I've got other
&gt; things on my
&gt; mind; I always try to be nice and personable; I'm always hoping
&gt; for the one
&gt; time someone will come up and say &quot;You know, I've got a couple of those
