Subject: Re: Engine Hatch Hinges

&gt;The engine hatch hinges are very worn and i wonder if any one has rebuilt
&gt;theirs? Knock out the pin, drill oversize and
&gt;install a larger roll pin? Might be tough to keep the drill straight.


When I got a new engine hatch for my 71 (a freebie from a listee) I moved my
hinges over from my old rusty hatch and replaced the pins (didn't have drill
anything out, lucky there I guess) with stainless steel bolts with allen
heads and nylon ringed nuts.  Looks nice and trim, very easy to do.

I got new rubber &quot;gaskets&quot; from West Coast Metric, and they fit just fine.
Worth doing.
