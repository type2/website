Subject: Sliding door question

It's been a few years since I sold the &quot;Magicbus&quot; and haven't been on the list
since. I was #32 on the list lots of years ago, how many can remember that
long ago?

Just &quot;purchased&quot; a 74 Kombi with a few problems, among them a badly rusted
sliding door channel (bottom).  Anyone restored one of those lately?  How many
pieces are we talking about, 3?  I guess it's a weldemin job.  CIP1 has the
parts but the pics in their catalog look kind of ambiguous.  Does one have to
tear the whole thing apart before ordering?
