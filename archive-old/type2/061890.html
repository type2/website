 I think this deserves a price for ingenuity. It's a prime example of making
 a paradigm shift. I never ever contemplated the idea that you get have
 something else than water coming out of the tap. Maybe we can create a sort
 of contest out of this. &gt;&gt;
   All I know is the person that figures out how to get Jell-O to come through
the tap should be given Sainthood. 
  Peace, Love, and I myself don't use my water tank--why haul city water, when
I can get my water from some of the most beautiful rivers and streams Oregon
has to offer!
