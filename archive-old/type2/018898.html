Dear List Members,

Here are two great web pages I found. Driving Aids Development Corp.
Home and  Handicapped Driver Services . The second page has a neat
listing called Handicapped Driver Services, Inc. which is located in
Kennesaw, Georgia, not far from me! They offer a wide range of services
including the Driver's Ed Classes that Bob mentioned in his post. I'm
going to call them tomorrow and see if they can help me out. I will
report results!

Happy Trails
