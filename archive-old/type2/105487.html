Subject: Re: [T2] First Ride

&gt;&gt;&gt; Would it hurt to adjust the steering box? &lt;&lt;

&gt;eliminate all other sources of play in the steering
&gt;_before_ adjusting the steering box.
&gt;
&gt;here are the ones i can think of. i'm sure someone else
&gt;can add a few more.
&gt;
&gt;-coupling
&gt;-tie rods
&gt;-steering damper

And don't forget the ball joints, the front wheel bearings, and that big-ass
pin (linkpin? kingpin? bigpain? something like that).  Any one of these as
well as the ones listed in the previous e-mail (but most likely a
combination of several of them) will translate to a very loose feeling in
the front-end. 

If you try to adjust the steering box to tighten the steering without
checking/replacing all the 30 year old parts that make up the front
suspension and steering you'll end up with a bus that is hard to turn, won't
return to &quot;0&quot;, a ruined steering box, and a bus that still jumps all over
the place.
