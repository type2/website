Our 78 Westy has been violated.  The power control panel above the
refrigerator is missing the &quot;City/Battery&quot; switch and the device
(diode?) between the battery gauge and the test switch is broken.  

Where can I find a circuit diagram for this panel?  I did check the
archives, so I understand that most have abandoned the ammonia
refrigerator and the gauge in favor of newer hardware.

Thanks
