Subject: RE: [T2] Re: Cops and buses



I have got to interject on this one since I really thought that my bus would
be more of a magnet towards trouble. Being in Canada there are even less
busses on the road so it stands out even more. But not once yet, knock on
wood. I even took it from Calgary to Settle, WA. I wasn't at the border
crossing for more than 30 seconds each way. On the way into the USA there
was a dog and they walked it right around the 2 cars in front of me, but
when I got to the booth the customs officer with the dog stepped away from
my bus and made the dog just sit down. I have to agree with everyone on the
list that when you are pulled over just be polite. I had just fixed my 5.0L
Capri after a year of it sitting and I took it around the block once to try
and get a bit of charge into the battery. Wouldn't you know it I get pulled
over for just having a heaty car and by being very polite, conceding that I
was wrong and should not have been out in the car I was let off by the
officer. I was told if he caught me again with no insurance/registration he
would fine me for both times. That was a $2800 that he let me off just by
being polite. So I think that maybe they have a bad rap, or maybe all you
bus lovers just have to come to Canada where the cops normally wave and
smile when they see you in your bus....
