Subject: Odd things.

Today, I was looking at a friends new find.  It is  a 68 hardtop westy.  

I noticed a couple of things.  

1. The vent windows in the front doors, do not open.  I mean they have no
latch and the rubber completely seals them in.

2. It  doesn't have a door covering the gas tank.

Is this something Volkswagen did on panel vans.

The other odd things is that it does have a original clock.

Just thought is was odd.   Any thoughts welcome.
