Volks,
	I have an 1800 t4 engine which I upgraded the alternator to the 75 amp (I 
think that's correct) alternator found on later 2 liter engines. I have a 
two battery system- the first battery is the normal one, and the 2nd one is 
a deep cycle marine battery that I run our 12 volt coleman refrigerator off 
of. I have an auxiliary battery kit that is dividing up the current coming 
from the alternator between the two batteries. Last summer I had some 
trouble with neither battery getting charged, but it was the voltage 
regulator that went bad. I replaced that, but I have had the 2nd battery 
unhooked and haven't driven the bus that much since then. I also cleaned 
all of my connections (even the strap from the tranny to the frame). Today 
I hooked everything up and started her up. I checked the voltage at the 
dohickey that splits up the voltage from one battery to the other and here 
are my results:
Voltage coming from the Alternator- 13.96 volts
Voltage going to the Primary Battery- 13.06 volts
Voltage going to the Auxiliary Battery- 13. 38 volts

Is this good? Is this bad? I thought I remember  reading somewhere in the 
archives that voltage coming from the alternator should be 14.5 volts. Is 
this correct?
Thanks.
Joel
