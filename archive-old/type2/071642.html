I sooo know what your talking about, I'm sick of being classified as a 
&quot;hippy&quot; and people telling me to get back in my &quot;hippie bus&quot; or &quot;phish bus&quot; 
and smoke some dope.  thats why i want to try and get a different paint job 
to make it stand out differently.  oh well thats just the way it is.
