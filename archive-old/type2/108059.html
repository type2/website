Subject: Re: [T2] Am I on the right track??

Well, thanks to all who replied to my post. I can now say that my Bus is
safely home. To all of you who said its a fuel problem, you were right. My
fuel pump was muerto. Rather than just lay out 19 bucks for a new one I
figured I should find out why it died, after all its only like 2 years old.
It wasa  cheapo brazilian one, but I figured I had a problem. Well, duh, my
filter went from between the pump and my carbs, and it had a bit of crap in
it. Well I figured all that crap went through my pump and trashed it. So a
half hour later, I had a new pump on, put my filter in the right place and I
was back home.

Maybe one day I'll figure this bus out and be able to answer, my own dumb
questions (yeah right), but until then I appreciate all of you guys (and
gals) posts and answers


Thanks,
Zach    1970 Westy
