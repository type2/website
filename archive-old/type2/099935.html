&lt;&lt; Isn't there away to test Starters at home, without taking them to the

yes, you need:

tranny bell housing (the kind you unbolt from a later tranny works fine)
bushing to fit yr starter (6V or 12V)
attach starter to bell housing
ground starter to ground on battery.  (I bolted a ground strap to the bell 
housing)
touch + of battery to push on connection
hm, think you have to hook + of battery to bolt on starter as well, not sure 
but I think that's what I do, have a battery strap that goes from starter to 
battery, and a extra red wire from connection at battery that I hook to the 
coil when ground starting a motor.   Actually, to start I cross from the bolt 
to the push on connector with a screwdriver.

If you have a spare good starter you can leave it in this set up and bolt it 
to the motor you just buildt or acquired to test run it before installing it.

FLAPS don't have the bell housing, and for the non self supporting starters 
you need it, so FLAPS can't help you there.   They can do autostick starters 
(self supporting)
