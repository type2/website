I have a 77 westphalia that I cannot seem to get started.  The engine turns
over fine but it just won't catch.  It seems like sometimes it backfires and
almost catches but that's if I try to give it gas while it's turning over.  

This all happened after I started it up and was backing out of the driveway
and it stalled.  Ever since that stall, it won't catch (the final stall!!).

It used to start fine (stall often until warm) so I am a bit confused.  About
1,000 miles ago I replaced the points, cap, rotor, and plugs (all bosch).  I
also adjusted the valves too (HUGE difference).  

Also, the fuel pump and filter is only about 4,000 miles old (probably due for
a new filter).

Any suggestions.  I think I may resort to spraying some starting fluid down
the intake and see if it's a spark or fuel issue (any concerns with starting
fluid??).

TIA,
M.K.
