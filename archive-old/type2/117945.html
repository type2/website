Subject: Rear seatbelts for a westy 70

I have a 1970 sundowner. I have the seat belts from a non westy. They dont 
fit. Can I get a set of rear seat belts for this bus? I want to strap down 
my childs car seat. He was ammused by sitting in the front, then got tired 
of it. I dont really want after market stuff, so were any seat belts made 
for campers for the rear seat?
