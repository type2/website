Subject: Pickup owners clarification

Sorry for my vague note abut a kit for sale.

Let me clarify, and be real specific, then I wont have to answer so many
pmails.

This is an UN-asssmbled CANVAS only kit.
contains:  Correct natural canvas(in a roll), german grommets, webbing
straps, f. window.  Everything you need to cut and sew up your own tarp.

NOthing else.  I wish I had hoops to give all of you, have none.  I do find
them all the time at West Coast swap meets, the current price is usually
$300pr.  As for wood slats, make your own.

No , you cannot talk me into making just one more just for you.

I hope I didn't get anyone too excited for the deal of the century and it
turned out to be this junk.
