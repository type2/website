Hi Folks,

I took Sweet Pea (79 Westy, stock 2.0 FI) in for her first emissions test 
the other day, and she failed!  The CO level was way too high (8% rather 
than the 2% allowed or the 1% preferred), and the HC level was very close 
(430 vs. 400).  I searched the Type2 library and got some good info on what 
causes it, then searched thru my Bentley manual and found what to do to fix 
it.  My question to the list is as follows:

Short of repeatedly taking it in for emissions tests, how can I tell when my 
mixture is okay?
I tweaked the idle so it's around 1,000 (though it idles lower than that 
until it's warm) and turned the mixture screw so it's leaner, but didn't 
really see much change in fuel consumption.  We live at 8,000 feet, so the 
engine will tend to run richer anyway (less O2 here), but I'd like to think 
that I can correct for that with the mixture screw and the ECU will do the 
rest.  Power is smooth all thru the rev range; top speed is unchanged.

The bus was imported into Jacksonville in '79, and the PO drove it from 
Nebraska to Colorado about 5 years ago.  Therefore, I would imagine that it 
was set up for sea level.  The &quot;altitude compensator&quot; that Bentley mentions 
-- is it necessary?  Will it help?  Does anybody else have a similar 
operating environment?  Do I need to buy one of those fancy infrared exhaust 
gas analyzers?

Thanks for your help.
