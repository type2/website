Subject: Re: [T2] Bus died while driving and now doesn't start(Help

I once had the circlip fall off the trans end CV joint, the one that holds
CV joint to the axle, and eventually, the axle worked out of the CV joint
itself, towards the wheel, but the boot held it up so it appeared to be
still &quot;attached&quot;.  Put the bus in gear and it would rev, but not move.
Have someone put the the bus in gear with it running and let out the
clutch, and look at the CV joints at the trans, and if one is spinning, but
the bus is not moving, there is something wrong with that joint.  Good luck
&amp; be careful!
