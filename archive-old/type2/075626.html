Subject: RE:  [T2]  Westy Interior Panel Patterns

How about this:

I'll generate a basic AutoCad .dwg for the sliding door panel, as I think
that would be the easiest/best way to get all of the necessary dimensions to
you.   I'm no AutoCad expert, but I do use it in my work and know enough to
be dangerous.  What version - 2000, 14, 13....?

I can plot it full size and check against my bus to be sure it fits.

If you don't get any offers on the other panels I could check mine as best I
can without taking stuff apart to seriously.

Actually I would be glad to make a full size (24&quot; X 36&quot;) set of blueprints
for all the 68-72 Westy interior birch panels for the VW community and even
the door panels and the kick panels too. I have most of the original pieces
and could make the prints on AutoCad, but I need 2 things:

1) dimensions for the headliner, which I believe should be fabricated in 3
pieces. I also would need the dimensions for the driver's side panels. Russ
it would save me time if you could take some dimensions for the sliding
door. I have the rear deck lid panel and the trim pieces in the rear around
the spare tire.

2) somebody to check the dimensions by actually using the blueprints before
making them available to the public.

Anybody have those dimensions? A good way to check the dimensions is for
somebody to measure theirs against mine too.
