Subject: oil temps (my fix)

1974 weekender bus (camper, no poptop)

1) where is your sender - dipstick

2) what temps you get under what conditions - 180*F driving to and from
work about 5 miles one way. max speed around 70mph or so for long
durations in about 85*F or under outside temps and i dont reach above
210*F at all. if its hotter than say 90*F outside my temps will creep to
around 220*F max. last august it was 120*F coming home from santa cruz
to LA area and i never reached over 220*F so i was really glad!

3) what engine set up -1800cc pancake

i must mention i added an oil cooler midway under the left side of the
bus and moved my oil filter there too. its alot easier changing oil,
plus i dont have to worry about engine temps anymore. i machined an
adapter to mount where the oil filter normally goes and then since its
so hot around the engine i ran stainless tubing toward the front until i
got past the engine area, from there to the cooler and filter i ran
aircraft grade (super high PSI) oil lines. works really good and i never
have to wrry about temps in CA again!
best regards, dave

if you would like i can take some pictures of my setup and post them
here on a website!
