Subject: Dragging brake pads

Wow,

	Thanks for all the info on my dragging brake pads.  From what I
have gleaned from all your responses is that the dragging I have is a
little more than normal.  Worse, the resistance isn't constant throughout a
360° rotation.  Considering this and that the disc has a lot of grooves, my
bet is that the disc is old and a tad warped.  If it's salvagable, I'll
have it reground, otherwise I'll just buy a new one.

Again, thanks for all the great help.
