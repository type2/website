Subject: 76 For Sale

Hello List!!

  Well, I've just about accomplished everything I wanted with the parts
transplant between my 73 and 76, and I am now offering the 76 for sale.

  The motor and tranny has been spoken for, but the rest is still there.
I'm not looking to part it out so please don't ask. All the glass is there,
body in good shape with the normal surface rust spots, seats are so-so, no
middle seat though.

  Asking $150, you pull it away. I'm holding on to it for 1 week then it is
off to the junk yard.
