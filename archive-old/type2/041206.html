Subject: re: solenoid problems?

hey once again pholks!-

alright, i found the relay instructions and studied them hard, so my
question
about that is this:::
1.where, on the starter,  is the post that is terminal 30, or in other
words,
the direct connection to the battery.?
2. should i leave the wire from the battery on the post along with the
new
wire?
3. where do i stick the screwdriver to perform the test?
just touch it to a wire? which one?
thanx for all your help.:)
