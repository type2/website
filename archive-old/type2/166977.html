Subject: Re: [T2] A few questions about our '78

Ned and Don,

Thanks. These are both areas I haven't addressed yet - I have a new fuel
filter and all new fuel line to put on and I also know that some of the
electrical is a mess - mostly up front but the engine bay needs attention as
well. Some PO somewhere installed an alarm system and a CD player - the
front electrical looks like a flipping birds nest and there are things in
the engine bay that aren't hooked up to anything. It's a mess.

That was out reason for driving it home - so I can have more time to work on
it.

Thanks again for your replies.

Thanks,

Jeff &amp; Patty
