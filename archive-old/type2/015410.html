&gt;&gt; Hey Everyone, I have what may be a silly question but
&gt;&gt; better safe than sorry.  Before yesterday my steering
&gt;&gt; wheel (when i was driving and going straight)has a bar
&gt;&gt; across it that was in the mostly horizontal position. 
&gt;&gt; Now, today when getting in it is was more at a 45
&gt;&gt; degree angle.  

Indeed, you must know what has happened before driving the vehicle. The
only thing I can think of if it appears there is no excess slack is the
steering wheel nut is loose and the splines have stripped. 45° at the
steering wheel is at least 5 to 10° at the wheels and something is surely
foul and could be very dangerous.
