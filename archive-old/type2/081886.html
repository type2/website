Subject: Re: [T2] tire size 72 westy ?'s

The correct tire size is 185R14. NO numbers in the middle.
As far as using a truck tire, I do not know what size you would need in a
truck tire numbering system. Here is a website where you can type in the
original size and then the new size [but not a truck size] and compare the two
tires. However, you will have to use an aspect ratio number. Since a tire
having no middle numbers has a ratio of 82, you do not have this choice. You
will have to use 80.

The next size wider from 185R14 is 195/75R14, then 205/70R14.
Your biggest concern will be the minimum load rating marked on the sidewall.
The correct number is 1540 lbs. Anything higher is fine. Anything less is a
passenger tire....

&gt; what is the tire size i need on my 72 west, i
&gt; currently have car tires on it and want to go with
&gt; something more appropriate like light truck tires.  if
&gt; a wider size would be better than stock then that
&gt; would be cool also but stock is just fine with me as
&gt; i'm going for functionality over looks on this.
