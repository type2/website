Subject: RE: [T2] fuel/vent line question

Mine isn't connected at all either. But it's laid out in a fashion that
would suggest that the side with 2 hoses goes to the air filter, and the
single hose side goes to the fan shroud. They just point in the right
directions.

&gt;&gt;&gt;  Mike...are you sure the end with the two nipples (one small, one
big) 
is the end hooked to the shroud?  On my 73, it's the opposite.  Now, I'm

wondering.  However, if mine was flip-flopped, it would not fit with 
the original factory configuration of the vent lines.  i.e. the shround 
HAS to connect to the side of the canister with the single large nipple.

Anyone else?
