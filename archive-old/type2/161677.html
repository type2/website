Subject: vw dry spell and then..

I know people were mentioning how rare sitings are..
Usually in Saskatoon, Sk you see a few.
But this year it's been fairly dry so far.
I've been driving Foxy all spring. I see the occasional
Vanagon but that mostly it.
Today I see a green hi-top, an orange 78, a green 78 (guessing
on that one) and 2 vanagons.
Not a bad day at all!
Mine was prettiest though!
