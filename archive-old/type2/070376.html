&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; So now I'm back to being undecided again!  Their Sales Executive is on
&gt;&gt; vacation and is supposed to contact me, but in the meantime they sent
&gt;&gt; a one-page (front and back) brochure showing two of their models, the
&gt;&gt; Compact 1600W and the 2600W, which put out 1600 and 2600 watts of heat,
&gt;&gt; respectively.  Could someone give me an idea of how much heat that would
&gt;&gt; be?  Chris wrote of the 1600W model (approx. 14&quot;x6&quot;x4&quot;, the 2600 is 14&quot;x
&gt;&gt; 5&quot;x8&quot;) being entirely adequate even for Alaska, but this MUST be a
&gt;&gt; different scale or measurement than, for example, a 1500W hair dryer
&gt;&gt; (which I doubt would do much to heat my bus).  How much would 1600 watts
&gt;&gt; be in BTUs?  How many BTUs does the BN4 put out?  Other specs. (FYI) are
&gt;&gt; as follows:
&gt;
&gt;I've one of these puppies on order and just got the visa bill (gulp!) $570.00
&gt;Ouch!  Oh well, on those cold nights (or days) I'm sure I'll appreciate it.
&gt;Anyone wanting to stay in my camper while it's cold out is going to get 
&gt;charged a $20 entrance fee.  ;)  I talked with Chris and he said that it 
&gt;was quite comfortable and heated the van up fairly quickly.  He said to 
&gt;be sure to order the 1/4 inch copper pipe size conversion as well as the 
&gt;mushroom shaped flues for the exhaust/inlets for the burner or you might 
&gt;get snow/dirt in the pipes.   I believe that somewhere in the flyer that
&gt;it says it puts out 5000 BTUs.
Hey, I never thought of charging admission!  I live across the street from
a kind of lowlife bar; I know one or two from there that I could probably
just RENT the bus to, parked right next to my house, for a couple of the
colder months.  ;-)  I've still not decided, but I'll probably contact
Espar and at least get a copy of their BN4 manuals to look over, and maybe
call Ark Mirvis (sp?) in NJ to see how much he'd sell me a BN4 &quot;kit&quot; for,
to save me the trouble of trying to find all the pieces here in the VW
wasteland.  Looks like it comes down to about $200 for a used but decent
shape BN4 vs. $570 for a brand new propex.  So Steve, are you planning on
using the disposable propane bottles, or do you have a regular tank?
