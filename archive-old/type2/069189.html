Subject: re:OEM panels

     Rusty, are these the panels that just arrived at Wolfsburg?  If so, we 
     also ordered a set for Lea's early'63 single cab and are axiously 
     awaiting arrival.  Finding parts for this vehicle in the central 
     florida area is miserable.  No one has them or wants to order them.  I 
     have learned a lot the last week, though, such as:
        1) there are several differences from early '63 to late '63, ie: 
     brake shoes, kick panels
        2) the '63 bus uses a 36mm rear axle nut, not the 46mm that's on my 
     '66.
        3) the nifty looking keyhole covers for single cab storage box 
     doors shown in WCM's catalog are not and have not been available for 
     two years, argggg
     
     Live and learn
     Ray
