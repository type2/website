They do this for trips into Mexico on a regular basis.  Alot of RV'ers do 
this as well.  Pretty neat to see a long train with nothing but VW's or 
RV's on it.  People walking around the flat beds and the like.

&gt;Yesterday I was thinking somewhat tangentially, in response to Joe
&gt;Clark's e-mail about going to Jerome, that it would be nifty to somehow
&gt;come up with a railroad flatcar, modified so that 15-20 buses could be
&gt;tied down on it. East coast people could make it to Jerome, west coast
&gt;people to BBTA and points east, and it would be a gas on the flatbed. But
&gt;this idea is really halfbaked. Don't even know if it would be legal, let
&gt;alone affordable.
