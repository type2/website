Subject: Wiring &amp; Fuse Boxes

Yet another question for the list:

My alternator burnt out last weekend, and I'm having a rebuilt one
installed next week Tuesday.  While the garage is installing this, I'm
also going to have connect auxillary wires + (positive) termial of the
alternator and starter switch so I can hook this up to my ampmeter
guage.   I would also like to have an extra wire connected from the +
(Positive) side of the alternator to a 2nd battery (deep cycle battery)
that I plan to install in the spring to run the fridge and some
auxillary items such as radio, sound and lights.

Any idea about what guage wire I should be using for this purpose of
charging the 2nd battery?  The wire will run from the alternator to an
isolator that will charge the second battery.

2nd question:  I want to wire up a fuse box from the positive lead of
the 2nd battery for my auxillary Power needs.  Any ideas where I might
be able to get a VW Bus Fuse box for this purpose?  I assume that this
will be a product that is no long sold anywhere, so I may be looking for
a old used one, or one scraped from bus.  Let me know if you have one
for sale, or know where I could get one.   Thanks!
