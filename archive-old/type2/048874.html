Subject: [T2] Doghouse blues

Hello bus-types,

I am in the midst of an engine rebuild.  My car is
a 69 pickup and it originally was a single port
engine vehicle.  I am building a dual port engine
and want to incorporate the doghouse cooling
tin, fan, and thermostatic shutters, etc.

My dilimma... I have never dealt with a doghouse
engine and I am not too sure of all the little
nuances and particulars involved.  I want to be
sure I am getting it all RIGHT, and that I am
getting all the necessary parts... right down to
the smallest clip or washer.  There is a lot of
money tied up in this new engine and I want to be
sure it warms and cools correctly.

My question... is there a particular Bentley
manual or other resource that I can reference to
make sure I will be getting this doghouse thing
right?  I am looking for exploded diagram and
catalog of what parts comprise a complete doghouse
setup.  also any tips from you knowlegeable
ones will be welcome.

Next question...  I have a Bentley manual for my
vehicle, but I notice its page count is lower than

some of the other VW manuals they publish.  Does
anyone believe that there is more engine info
contained in one of the larger Bentley manuals...
such as the one that is for the type 1 that is
about
1000 pages and costs about twice the 38 or so
bucks I paid for the type 2 Bentley manual.

Thanks for your help!  I appreciate it!!

Chas.  '69 double cab

I appreciate any help I can get concerning the
above.
