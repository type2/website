If your stock pump is working, leave it be!

&gt; Anyone have experience with doing this? Do they work
&gt; well? Are they really just a scam? Where does it have
&gt; to be wired to get power, coil? Run wire to fuse box?

They work OK.  You may have to add a pressure regulator if the pump puts
out too much pressure.  Usually power is drawn from the hot wire on the
coil, but make sure that you're not overloading that circuit.

&gt; I have noticed that my fuel filter seems to run empty
&gt; a lot. Even after installing a new mechanical fuel
&gt; pump.

Filters seldom run full as they trap bubbles in the fuel.  Nothing to
worry about unless you have fuel starvation problems.  I don't think that
my fuel filter has ever run full.

&gt; I don't know if this has caused any issues with
&gt; my engine getting enough fuel or not, but it seems
&gt; like it could. Could the electric replacement help
&gt; this out?

I think that it's a non-problem.  The stock setup is reliable and doesn't
tax the electrical system.  Unless you have a really good reason to change
it (hot engine that needs more fuel flow, perhaps), stick with the stock
pump.
