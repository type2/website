In Santa Clara Ca. , on the El Camino Real, at a &quot;Wheels and Deals&quot;  used car
lot (the kind where you pay a fee to park your vehicle , post a sticker in the
window with the particulars, and wait for someone to wonder by and call you up
to start the selling/buying process)

Saw them on the lot this week end, but didn't have time to stop and look. 
Driving by they appeared to be pretty good shape, shiny, one metalic blue and
the other metalic red.  Don't know year or price etc.
