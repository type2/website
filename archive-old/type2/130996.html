Subject: RE: [T2] just purchased a 70 Bus and have some questions

Congrats, I'll be an adventure!!!

Besure and have the valves adjusted pre-trip. They need to be done with the 
engine cold so maybe you can find a VW mechanic up there and have it sit at 
his place over night and let him change oil, adjust valves, and time the 
engine and other basic tune up stuff. It will be money well spent.

If you don't have the Bentley manual, get the Muir book (idiot manual). 
Basic set of metric tools is really handy. Get some really basic type parts 
such as fuel filters and points, those are things that can save your butt on 
the road and are easy to replace. Get a generator belt as well. I'm stocking 
up on emergency type parts such as a clutch and accelerator cable but other 
people will think that's overboard.

Let us know how it goes and if you have any more questions.

I am in Savannah, Ga and am
&gt;going up to Trenton New Jersey to pick up this bus. I am going to be 
&gt;driving it back approx 750 mile trip. It's in driveable condition, but I 
&gt;would like to take some precautions do you have any suggestions?
