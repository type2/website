Subject: Re: [T2] Heating with water - seeking what-if-ideas

Complicated, but it will work.

I was thinking of fabricating a sheet metal box, and mounting the oil
cooler and fan assembly into the rear closet if you have a westy, or
under the rear seat, in a transporter.

An oil filter mount adapter for the oil coller lines is really simple.

In the line to the cooler there is a thermostat so it won't function
until up to temp., and a T fitting in both lines with valves is simple.

This whole process is one heck of allot easier, than trying to get a H2O
setup functioning.

Okay, how about this? (Warning: not stock and won't work if you have two
batteries.) 
Start with an oil cooler, as you mentioned. Devise a good way to send
oil from your engine case to the oil cooler; I was thinking having it
drilled and tapped would work. The oil outlet and inlet should both be
above the tin. 
Build a sheet metal box to hold the oil cooler. It must fit on the
driver's side battery tray. Put an air inlet in the upper rear left
corner so you can draw air from the side scoop. Put an air outlet in the
bottom so you can attach a hose that goes through the battery tray, and
which leads to the stock heating system. Install the most powerful fan
you can get in the top hole, and make a little &quot;wall&quot; in the box that
completely seals the box into a top compartment and a bottom
compartment. Cut a hole in it the size of the oil cooler and bolt the
oil cooler into it. 
Cut a hole the size and position of the air outlet in your driver's side
battery tray and mount the &quot;heater box.&quot; Make sure that when you screw
the side cover on, there is a good seal in there. (Come to think of it,
you may want to devise another way of getting air into the box.) 
Now you need plumbing and wiring. Connect the fan to a switch in the
cab; a two-speed fan motor would be nice. Connect the outlet to your
Bus's standard heating ductwork. (If you're slick, you can integrate
this new line with the old lines coming off the heat exchangers.) 
Oil plumbing: You need two three-way ball valves. They will be mounted
securely somewhere you can easily get to them. A three-way ball valve
looks like a T. The stem of the T goes to the engine, on both valves.
One crossarm outlet of each valve goes to the oil cooler. The remaining
outlet goes to the other valve. I would get a short little piece of pipe
with threads on both ends, and screw one valve to each end so that the
handles are on opposite sides of the setup. 
When you want heat, turn the handles so they're pointing away from each
other. The oil will flow into the oil cooler. No heat? Point the handles
toward each other and the oil will go through the little pipe and right
back into the engine. 
It's a major engineering project but if you can pull it off, you can be
just as warm as a dump truck driver.
