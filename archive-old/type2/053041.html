&gt;I have a similiar problem with my 73 1700cc Dual-carb'ed bus, it

&gt;35-40 MPH and I pull over.
&gt;Once at the side of the road, I rev the engine a few times to listen for
&gt;errant noises, but I am yet to hear anything unusual. But after a minute
&gt;or so curbside, it settles out and runs just fine.

Just another data point, but I encountered *exactly* the same symptoms due
to a failing coil... Running below about 50mph, everything would be just
fine.  But at sustained higher speeds, the engine would make enough heat
to warm up the coil, which would then start to fail... power would drop,
although the engine wouldn't quit entirely.  Once the coil cooled down, it
would be fine until the process repeated itself.  I suspected the fuel
system for a long time, but it eventually proved to be the coil. YMMV.
