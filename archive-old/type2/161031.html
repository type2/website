Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel door &amp; Engine lid lock

Hi Isaac,

If all you need is a key I would suggest you contact  
steveslockshop_dot_com. Steve can provide a replacement key based on the  
code number on the existing lock. Or he could provide a replacement  
lock if that's what you want.

There is a lockable  Type 181 (Thing) gas cap that fits the early bay  
filler neck. IIRC Germansupply_dot_com has them.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Actually it is missing the key. when I bought it the key was  
&gt; missing. As for
&gt; the fuel hatch there is a hole that looks like it would except a  
&gt; lock, but
&gt; the locking fuel cap sounds like a good idea, but wouldn't i have  
&gt; to get an
&gt; alternate filler tube?
