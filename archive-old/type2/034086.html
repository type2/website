Subject: torsion bar blues

okay, the ball joint boots weren't the last hurdle.... the old torsion bars 
slipped out of the old front beam like nothin' but putting them in the new 
one is hard.  I tried Walter's idea of grinding a little bevel of each of the 
leaves, but still in both upper and lower I can only get 8 of the nine in. I 
tried hammering w/ a balll peen hammer, but no go, and I didn't really hammer 
too hard cause I don't wasnt to mess anything up in there.
Did vw make different sizes of leaves? thicknesses, widths, etc? especially 
in 68-69? Or am I just not using the right cusswords?
