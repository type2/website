Subject: RE: [T2] Westy need seatbelts in NJ?

Tom asked:

&gt;&gt;Is it illegal to ride people back there w/o belts?  And if it is, where do 
&gt;&gt;I find some.


Tom, you are obvious very adventurous.

You may wish to go over the southern USA border into Tijuana Mexico, and 
offer a ride up north to San Diego for 'people' willing to pay $100, 
provided that they sit in the back area of the Westy that does not have seat 
belts.

You could ask them to bring some of their special blend of cigarettes with 
them if you are really looking to push the envelope

Barry
