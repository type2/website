List members come on by and see me in the swap at OCTO (got the new
type2parts t-shirts today)and drop a note and I will pass the word on to all
other list members that come by, of course if THOM shows we could all meet
at the vintagebus_dot_com bus or even better how bout the VW Planet bus or
George Lyles bay window.


Will the Havasu Boys ever get there sh#t together?

	
As of a half hour ago we finally got it together. There will be 8 Buses and
a Ho#_at_a leaving Havasu at 6am sharp. We are going the 29 Palms route and
will hook up to I 10 in Palm Springs. We will stop in Cabazon and wait for
the Phoenix Caravan and see how many buses we can fit under the
Dinosaurs!!!! what a photo op that will be.

JP, Kerry and Berry made it here today from New Mexico and we bid the
Buskatour farewell at 4 this morning.


There has been a change of plan and hope you relay this on to all. We have
to make a detour and will meet the Phoenis Caravan in CABAZON (you know
where the dinosaurs are). We will be there hopefully around 11 and will wait
till 12 O'clock there. VW Howard screwed up and didn't realize that Cabazon
was 75 plus more miles then Chiraco Summit, DUH.  we will be on channel 2 on
the CB's.
