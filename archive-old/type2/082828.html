&gt; Even in warmer climes if you just take a lot of short

&gt; areas) Has observed this. It's my understanding that
&gt; this will happen if your oil never gets hot enough to
&gt; evaporate the water. I've seen it on my bus now and
&gt; then. Is your thermostat working? As cold as it is
&gt; where you are at that would be an important part of
&gt; the
&gt; system I would think.
&gt;   What I havent seen is the oil itself discoloring as
&gt; you described. I would change the oil and quit useing
&gt; the fuel additives and see if the situation changes.

Keep in mind that a little milk in the filler neck isn't a death notice.
the filler neck is the coldest part of the oil system and is where all the
vapor passes on the way to the air cleaner, so you might get some
condensation there and not in the crankcase.  If your drain oil looks like
chocolate milk, you have a problem, but a little foam in the filler cap
isn't bad.
