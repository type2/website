Subject: Gene Berg

Who is Gene Berg, and why is his name stamped inside my engine under the
valve cover?

My other question, what would all the black &quot;burned&quot; stuff be around the
valve cover gasket, inside on the engine etc?  Smelled burnt when I took it
off, and I have much dirt (or probably engine particles) if I was to guess.

1600 DP I just bought and having my first looksee....
