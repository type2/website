Subject: Rebuilt 1700

 
--Tyler,

welcome to the list if you're new, let me go piece by piece,

&gt;i have been told by a few people to not put new heads on a worn &gt;motor,

Maybe type I folks. The type IV case is an especially robust aluminum case with an oft-called &quot;bulletproof&quot; bottom end. Type IV folks routinely change/fix heads without even splitting the case.

&gt;So, i am looking to buy a new 1700,or rebuild mine,

I don't believe there are &quot;new&quot; type IV cases.

&gt;i have never pulled the motor before, so does anybody have any tips &gt;for pulling the motor,

Do you have the Robert Bentley publishers Official Service Manual? You must if you want to run a bus. It'll have most everthing you need and the list is good for specific questions.

&gt;also any tips on where to buy a good rebuilt motor or new motor,

BusDepot for starters.

&gt;preferably here in colorado,

BustedBus in boulder.

&gt;or, a place to buy the parts for the type 4, i cant seem to find a &gt;good place to find/buy these parts

Busdepot, bustedbus for used parts, the busboys (www.busboys.cc) and there's more.

Billy
