    They're not all that hard to do -- I've done them myself by putting
the new seats on a block of dry ice and putting the head in the oven for
awhile to get it about 200-300 degrees, the hardest part is making sure
the seat is square, which you should be able to do with the new valve --
and yes, you only use new exhaust valves, don't regrind one, as they
stretch and eventually break.
