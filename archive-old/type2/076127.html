I have been running the MXT 205 on my 78 for a number of years and I like
it very well.  I do not go off road a lot but I ski and wanted a good all
season radial.

&gt; mentioned that is better I would really appreciate it.  I don't want to 
&gt; spend allot of coin, but I realize that getting the proper tires is more 
&gt; important than saving a couple of bucks.

the MXT if you can find it is not a little coin in fact be prepared to
fork over in excess of $100 per tire...
