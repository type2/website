 The horn on my '72 is dead.  I checked the local parts places and they 
all have some generic european horn which looks almost identical to the 
original.  It comes in a high or a low note.  Do either of these horns 
sound like the original or should I hold off till I find a Hella?

My advice is that it is better to have a horn that no horn.    If it bolts on
easily and works, use it, unless you are dong the ten point restoration.
Horns are an important disaster aversion tool.   If you want one thats sounds
original, find one later, Don't these guys cost about ten bucks?   So it's not
a lot.  I like a 6V horn myself as it is really loud and obnoxious.  Really
makes people sit up and notice- when I am saying &quot;don't run into me!&quot; it
TURNS IT ALL TO CAPS.

my two cents.
