Subject: 009 w/34pict--possible idle solution

Hi everyone, 
I kind of recently put a rebuilt angine (1600dp)in my bus and was
planning on using dual webers but they needed to be rebuilt so decided
on going back to the stock 34pict-3 carb for now.I also have the dreaded
009, a bugpack header w/ single quiet pack, and a 100 cam.  I was
reading an article on BostonEngine_dot_com about problems with the
009/34pict combo and boston Bob says that putting a pop rivet in the
throttle plate idling hole and setting the 009 to 10deg. btdc will fix
my poor idling problem by giving me more adjustment on the idle
screw(now it idles high with the screw all the way in). I was wondering
if anyone has tried this and if so what kind of results they got.  Also
i would like to add that I checked valve clearances, point gap, plug
gap, and all the other stuff.  right now i have the 009 at around 9 deg
btdc.  What do you guys think? any response will be greatly
appreciated.  Brian 71 westy
