Hello List,

I wanted to thank everyone that responded to my
question regarding the brackets. It makes sense now. I
am going to inspect the air filter box and see where
they bolt to. Thanks again for everyone's helpful
responses!!!!

Have a great day!

David Kelly

&gt; Dave, if you haven't gotten any replies, those sure
&gt; look like the brackets that
&gt; mount to the engine block, between the Carbs, to
&gt; hold the Air Filter assembly. 
&gt; They look like the ones that I had on my '73, with
&gt; 1700 engine.  That was a
&gt; paper filter Air Filter.  Hope this helps.
