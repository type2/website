Subject: dual battery setup????

Hey y'all,

Decided to go ahead and do the dual battery thing this summer to run fans.  I
went all summer just running straight off a deep cycle and recharging when
low.  Well I finally bought the Hella Dual battery relay and had a question.
What is everyone running terminal 86 to?  It is supposed to go to a 12v supply
that is only alive when either the ignition is switched on or when engine is
running.

Also as I was cruising the archives I saw several posts saying not to use
battery isolators.  Would this dual battery set up be considered one of these
and if so is the consensus that these are bad?  The posts were from the early
90's.  And I couldn't find a final answer.

TIA

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
