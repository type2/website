Subject: Re: [T2] How to install a heater???

&gt;listees,
&gt;
&gt;Now that we are on this subject of heat, does anyone have or know of a good
&gt;guide that has GOOD pictures of the work actually being done?
&gt;
&gt;I think I need the IDIOT's guide to VW heater installation.  me=heater idiot
&gt;thanks &gt;cyberbeetle

I have been trying to find the time to produce a &quot;how to&quot; video on
rebuilding and installing a gas heater, but being a single dad doesn't
leave much time, maybe someone else will take up the slack.
