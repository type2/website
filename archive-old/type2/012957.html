Hello All:

I'm going through my first VW engine build, and I've reached a point where I need some help.  The Muir book refers to a spring that goes into the distributor opening in the engine case, but they don't show a picture of it.  I went to a local VW junk yard to find one of these springs, and the proprietor gave me a small spring that looks like the spring out of a ball-point pen, except a little thicker.  I was skeptical, but he insisted it was the correct spring.  Last night, I tried fitting the distributor drive shaft in to the engine case, and there's no way that this can be the correct spring.  It won't stay in place under the distibutor shaft, because there's no place for it to rest.  So, does anyone know what this spring looks like, and where I can get one quickly??  

My next question, the Muir book also refers to some &quot;small square things&quot; that apparently work with the lifters in some manner.  I bought  a reconditioned case, and there are no &quot;square things&quot; near the lifter holes.  Any ideas??

Thanks,
