Subject: RE: [T2] helpin' hippies

&gt; So yesterday at the farmer's market, there's more hippy 
&gt; kids than usual and I find out that the Rainbow people 
&gt; were in the mountains near us and have descended for
&gt; mirthmaking.
&gt; 
&gt; He can't get his valve covers on because the valve stems are 
&gt; so far out that they do not fit. He has apparently shimmed up 
&gt; the rocker arms just to be able to get them over the valve 
&gt; stem. Is this a &quot;dropped valve seat&quot;?  He wants to perform 
&gt; highway travel and I think he needs a new/used head at least, 
&gt; without having looked at anything yet.
&gt; 
&gt; Oh yeah, he wants to pay me for any time/tools/equipment in 
&gt; Chocolate that'll &quot;blow my mind&quot;, semi-precious stones, and 
&gt; other trinkets. He's trying desperately to land the vehicle 
&gt; at my house for undisclosed periods of time, He introduced 
&gt; himself as &quot;Gravy&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; What am I getting myself into?


Regarding the engine repair, or the hippy, or both? :-)

I tend to assume the best of people until shown otherwise, and have
almost always been glad I did. Sure, sometimes you get burned. But on
the other hand some of the best experiences in my life, and best
friendships, would never have happened had I not kept an open mind. In
fact I'd probably never have met my wife, never had my little girl, and
never started the Bus Depot. 

Of course there is some risk. Wasn't it the Reagan administration (ugh!)
that said &quot;trust, but verify&quot;?  So if it were me, and I had the time and
resources to offer, I'd help but with a reasonable amount of caution and
with reasonable limits. First of all, keep your eye on him somewhat
until you get to know him.  And get a commitment up front as to what he
will do with his bus, and when, should you be unable to fix it at a very
low cost, since he apparantly has little to pay (unless his chocolate is
truly exceptional and you like that sort of thing :-). 

Then, teach him, don't do it for him. Tell him what bolts to remove, go
do something else, and he can yell for you when he needs help again.
Furthermore, perhaps he can return your favor by helping you in some
unrelated way. Maybe you have some yard work he can do or something - a
barter of his time and effort in exchange for yours. Just on principle
I'd ask for this; people should be more than willing to return a favor.
If this concept scares him off, then so be it. It will tell you much
about his character.

As an ex &quot;hippy&quot; of sorts myself (I never went to rainbow gatherings,
but did follow the Grateful Dead around to 150+ shows while in my teens
and twenties), I've met many folks like Gravy  Yes, there are addicts,
thieves, slackers, and complete a-holes among them, as with any
population.  But mostly I have found honestly good, trustworthy, giving,
and intelligent people. Just like any other group of people. Some remain
good friends of mine to this day (although most aren't looking quite so
&quot;hippy&quot; anymore :-).
