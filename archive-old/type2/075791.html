Subject: Re: [T2] why 1978?

Guess I was thinking of the heater box flange shapes matching 72-74 instead 
of one year only exhaust pieces. And luckily I don't live in CA I don't have 
to worry about the correct exhaust for my year :)

&gt;79 is essentially identical but has a one off head and exhaust manifold
&gt;making it harder to get some parts
