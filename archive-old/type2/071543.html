Subject: Bench running T2 FI engine
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

I have just pulled a T2 FI 2.0 engine from a late 75 Westy. The PO says that 
the engine &quot;makes noise&quot;. He wasn't able to give further info that was useful.

I would like to test this engine on the bench before tearing it down. Of 
course, I'll do a compression test and a visual check before I run it.

My questions come down to two areas....electrical and cooling.

Assuming that all the FI components are on the engine, and the pump and reg 
are connected, which electrical connections are required for the FI and 
ignition to work? I know how to do this with a carbureted engine, but I know 
that the FI requires more bits to be powered.

Second, does all the tin need to be mounted for bench running? Will the 
engine overheat due to bottom air running up into the induction system?

I would like to run the finished engine (if I have to rebuild) for a good 
long time before installing it in the bus, so I don't want to hazard 
overheating.
