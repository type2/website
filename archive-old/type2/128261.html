Subject: Cam question

Hello, I am almost ready to work on my 79 bus motor. I
was wondering if anyone is using the WEB-CAM 107i.
Webcamshafts_dot_com states:&quot;Good overall power for
engines with stock fuel-injection. Designed for
hydraulic lifter.&quot; this will go into a so far stock
2000cc FI motor. Any comment on this upgrade would be
great. I am just looking for a little more power
without losing my fuel injection. 
Thanks,
Shawn R.
