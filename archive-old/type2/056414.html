Subject: RE:  FI and head temp sensor

&gt;problem when it's hot (running for 20-30 minutes). If I shut it off 
&gt;and came back 5-10 minutes later it would start and idle but if I 
&gt;tried to accelerate it bogs down like I'd pulled a plug wire (or 2). 
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;poking around and was considering re-installing an old head temp 
&gt;sensor that I had. When I started to loosen the installed one it was 
&gt;loose -- wobbly loose. It took 3 or 4   turns to get it back in and 
&gt;tight. It is a stubby bayonet sensor that fits the sensor hole on a 

Makes good sense to me!  If the sensor was really loose, it would not
have been grounding properly (either poorly or intermitantly).  That
would certainly screw-up the resistance it is supposed to be creating on
that lead.

Let us know if tightening it fixed the problem.  Good luck!!
