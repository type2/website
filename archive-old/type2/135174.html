Subject: A/C belt Question

All these A/C posts going around got me thinking of warmer days and getting
my A/C (was in bus when I purchased it :-) going. it is a 'standard' under
dash unit with the compressor on the left side of the motor.

 

My question is. does anyone know what the correct 'fan' belt size is for
this type of setup?  The pulley for the belt is behind the fan.

 

TIA

 

Wayne
