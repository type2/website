Subject: 65$ Paint Job


For all those interested, I just painted my bus close to original Organge
with Krylon Interior/Exterior enamel paint.  It took approx. 18 spray cans,
and an extra white one for the bumper.  The paint job looks great and feels
great to the touch.  The total cost was approx. 65$USD, including plastic
spray gun adapter for bottles.

FYI, the bus was previously sprayed black on the sides and painted with
planets, stars and flowers all over.  It now looks great, and should be
more enjoyable to drive for this summer.  The Orange appears to be a great
match to the original.  Time will tell how it holds up with sun exposure.

Regards,
Shawn
