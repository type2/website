Hi folks,

It's been a couple months since I've stopped for a fill up at Type2_dot_com and
now here I am with some bus related adventures to recount.  So grab those
driving goggles, let's go for a ride!

My wife and I spent last month on holiday in Holland and France. Our
convenient rail travels gradually convinced me that our reliance at home on
personal, motorized transportation was too much a luxury.  I resigned that
upon our return, we would sell our beloved '71 Westy and buy a nice bicycle
with one of those comfy gel seats and some saddle bags for my junk.  And
maybe a trailer.  Perhaps I could add a motor over the front wheel like the
old Solex powered bicycles.  That would be, of course, to counteract any
post air cooled withdrawal depression.  The surplus proceeds could apply
toward the next European vacation, or maybe a month's worth of large pizzas.
Yet only three weeks after making this radical resolution here I find myself
bussing again, driven by necessity. I'm a slave to practicality.

During our frenzied rail travels and sight seeing in Holland we were able to
link up with Brian Verbeek, a long time Type2 list member and email friend
in Den Haag.  I arrived at Brian's work place, a Porsche dealership, where
he kindly rearranged his day's schedule to give me a tour.  Brian is one of
those modest, intelligent types who makes managing a parts department while
entertaining some wide-eyed American who just fell out of the sky look so
easy.  The precious collection of Hazet and dealer tools hanging along the
wall in the service area immediately triggered my Pavlovian reaction.  Brian
continued the tour, casually noting the engine features on the 911s that
were scattered in the service area, some conveniently raised on lifts,
others poised for take-off.  &quot;Is this heaven?&quot;  No, it's virtual Stuttgart.
Unfortunately, Brian was our only VW friend we had an opportunity to visit
in our travels, and our moments with him were very enjoyable but too
fleeting.  I recall at some point I mentioned to Brian that I was thinking
of selling the bus, but I don't think he believed me.

I could tell you how impressed we were as travelers in Holland and how much
we enjoyed the historic sites and scenery we viewed in Provence and the
Riviera, but I'll keep my recollections VW bus specific.  In the centrum of
Brugge, Belgium we saw three working Type2's stationed strategically for the
tourists--three generations: T2, T3, and T4 buses, all painted maroon and
logo-ed, modified for storing and vending ice cream.  They were LPG powered
and doing a delicious job of serving the throngs.  But my favorite buses
were those I saw in Holland.  They were T3 (Vanagon) campers with a large
fiberglass high top, tagged &quot;Joker&quot;.  The only T1 bus we encountered was in
Marseilles.  It was restored and painted in a two-tone sealing wax red under
perhaps lime green (sorry splitty fans, memory fades).  As we approached via
the city bus the steep climb to Notre-Dame de la Garde with its intersecting
side streets, the spunky splitty full of bus nuts would occasionally cross
our paths, darting between streets, then disappearing again like the White
Rabbit.

Another of our T3 brethren we found hard at work in the medieval French city
of Carcassone (see
http://www.photovault_dot_com/Link/Cities/Europe/France/Carcassone.html for
photos of this beautiful city).  The panel van puttered along the
cobblestone streets with its little 1600, carrying carpentry equipment.
&gt;From an  American perspective, one really feels for these panel buses in
Europe.  Over there they are used to their potential, here they would likely
be dolled up and awed for their rarity (and maybe even accessorized).  I
chatted with the bus when his owner stopped for a job.  He figures he'll put
in a few more years of hard labor, but did seem interested in retiring to
the US.  His only reservation, aside from the language barrier, was that
some backyard mechanic might try fit him with some SAE fasteners.  The
thought seemed to make his oil turn cold (though like me, he was &quot;off&quot; when
we had this discussion).

We returned home after three weeks of site seeing and talking to buses.  As
I mentioned, I was mentally prepared to sell our beloved '71, but fate has a
funny way of smacking you around and changing your mind.  A day after our
return the weekend sun called me outdoors to the bus.  I did have those ball
joints, stabilizer bar bushings, bearings etc. waiting for a sunny day and
it would be a shame to sell the old bus without making the front end perfect
for the next owner.  So I set to work.

Mike Gensler has a nice article in the Type2 Library on torsion arm removal
and ball joint replacement
(http://www.type2_dot_com/library/suspens/balljoin.htm).  What Mike fails to
mention is the part where you have 
the torsion arms off with greasy parts scattered all around and your
landlord makes an impromptu visit with the estimator for paving the
driveway.  So allot some time to demonstrate the torsion bar front
suspension of the VW bus to your unexpected guests.  Only one upper torsion
arm was obstinate, but with a relentless barrage of 5 pound hammer blows,
the arm (on the bus) succumbed before neighbors decided to relentlessly
pound me for all the racket.  The only disappointment was the fit of the
&quot;OEM&quot; stabilizer bar bushing kit I purchased from RMMW. Though it was sturdy
and well plated, the design of the band clamp was such that it would not fit
properly around the torsion arm.  I instead used old clamps that Steve Dolan
graciously sent me awhile back when he sent spare torsion arms.   With the
front end back safely on the ground I set the camber and toe to
specification.  The undercarriage, front beam, spindles, and torsion arms
all boasted a coat of POR-15 gloss black paint.  Admiring the work, I
realized perhaps it was too soon to sell the old bus.  I should, after all,
get some use out of this fresh front end before passing it on...

My wish for something to do with the bus came true.  The following week I
removed the entire Westfalia interior to make room for tools and roofing
materials.   The '71 was about to get a taste of what its panel van cousin
in Carcassone faces on a daily basis.   The van was heavily weighted with a
healthy number of squares of shingles and tools. I was glad I had finally
switched from years of passenger car tire use to the load range D light
truck tires.  With the truck tires, the van handled safely with its heavy
load.  I'll make a few trips for additional squares, which should further
amuse the Home Depot employees with their &quot;Hippy Roofing Inc.&quot; smirks.  

The timing of the roofing job was impeccable, for soon I received a haunting
call from my brother-in-law.  I had made a forgotten promise a few years
back to move him from Toronto with the bus when he left the university.  It
was a Ph.D. program, which I hoped would take forever.  Maybe he'd even stay
in Toronto and the move would be a quick run across the city.  It didn't
matter if I made the promise over a beer or a cappucino, this was a family
commitment and a matter of honor--and one way or another I'd be going for a
drive.  Oh, hell. I was now hoping he hadn't taken a job in Vancouver or LA.

&quot;So where are we going?&quot;

&quot;Chicago,&quot; he said.

Chicago, that's not so bad.  &quot;When do you need me?&quot;

&quot;I'll get back to you soon.&quot;

Soon came, and a date was set for last weekend.  With the interior stripped
for the roofing payload, the van was conveniently vacant for the move.  The
logistics were a bit strange, but with some stamina and grit the 3,000 mile
adventure could be shoe horned into a four day weekend.  I'd drive from
Connecticut to Toronto, load up, then back track to New York City (that's
the strange logistic) from where we'd depart for Chicago.  My goal was to
leave Friday evening and return for work by 8am Wednesday.  The first leg of
the trip ending in NYC was about 1100 miles, and the route from NYC to
Chicago another 900, with another 1000 to return to Connecticut.  Intimately
aware of the current mechanical status of the bus, I wasn't worried about
break downs or any need for repairs.  I was, however, concerned about the
long stretch of Interstate 80 across Pennsylvania's Appalachians in a 1600cc
powered bus fully loaded with mostly books and furniture stacked on the roof
rack.  It promised to be an exciting challenge, and the primordial call of
Manifest Destiny beckoned the ready bus.  The spirit of adventure, the soul
of bus ownership, awakened.  Europe receded in memory.  Plans for selling
the bus would of course have to be postponed indefinitely...
