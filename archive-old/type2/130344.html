Subject: Re: [T2] ? About Hightops

I'm really happy with my 73 Westie with a Safare top.
The only negative is the increased sway in winds on the highway, its 
there, but not to the point of being a serious problem. I'm saving up 
for beefy sway bars which will help I hope !

There is a lot to be said for the space available up there for storage 
as well as having the ability to stand up and do whatever you need to 
do at any time, I'm 6'2 and if I'm standing up straight my head touches 
the ceiling but when do I ever stand up straight, really ? &lt;slouch&gt;

Its also a great place to put a flatscreen &lt;Grin&gt; I've also pulled my 
top bunk out and put two kayaks up there with three down low with the 
bed out, I figure 5 boats in a bus ain't bad. There is a LOT of space 
up there so you could in theory make pretty good use of it if you were 
creative. I really like how bright it is thought, lots of indirect 
light comes in.

I couldn't be happier with mine.

Jamie Auch recently put a Safare top on his bus ... I've not heard any 
negative sounds from him yet !
