In a message dated 98-07-20 22:07:24 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; When I get through, the '80 will have bad front rotors, a
 bad speedometer, extractor exhaust w/o converter, weber carbs, no curtains
 and miscellaneous similar defects. &gt;&gt;

I've been cleaning up a '79 9-seater that had an engine fire (the PO had NO
idea that it was not that badly damaged....).  Needless to say, the FI is
toast... burnt toast.  Will the carbs you have fit?  If so and you decide to
part with them I'd be interested in a shot at 'em.  (Gotta' put SOMETHING in
it to feed it an air/fuel mix...)  My '77 was converted to a single Weber and
it seems to go OK.  I'm also looking for a heater fan, engine fan shroud (the
little plastic grillwork thingy), etc. (basically anything PLASTIC in the
engine compartment....)  If you know where I can find those It'd be
appreciated.
