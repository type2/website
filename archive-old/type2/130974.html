Subject: AIRS Rescue in progress - but need advice...

Listees,

Just spoke to Danny with a 69 that has a shot bottom end. I just found out 
about a 71 for sale locally from Faster Laster with a good engine and I 
think Danny and I are going to go look at it tonight.

Danny does have the money to buy this bus for the engine so he has dibs on 
the bus, I was interested but would be glad to pass it up if it can get 
Danny to AZ. Would anyone be interested in a 71 with no engine for cheap 
cheap. Don't know a ton about the condition but the rust isn't horrible, 
tranny is good, and does have a dent in nose, no middle seat, both bumpers. 
I'll snag pics tonight.

But question of the day, will the 71 engine (it's a dual port) work in 
Dannys 69 bus? Do both years support the engine the same way or will we 
perhaps have to drill into the case or something.

Help is appreciated.

Thanks,
Daniel
