Hi Listers!
    I just got off the phone with the County Court Clerk here, and it seems
that a title is &quot;do-able&quot; for the 74 Westy I posted about Tuesday.  Here is
the deal.  First, send a registered letter to the last known address of the
PO.  Save the receipt.  Then run an ad in the paper for 3 consecutive weeks
advising the PO what the situation is on the off chance that he reads the
paper.  THEN, we have to give him 60 days to respond to the ad.  THEN, get a
bill from the mechanic showing the price for at least 10 days of storage and
any repairs that have been made.  THEN, bring the receipt from the letter, a
copy of the newspaper ad, the bill from the newspaper, the bill from the
mechanic to the courthouse, and VIOLA!  A new title!  WHEW!!!!
    Maybe it will work.  I guess I will let you know in about 60 days!
Thanks for all the replies!
