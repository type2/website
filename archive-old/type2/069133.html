Hello all,
This weekend, I took Friday off from work and road-tripped from here (Johnson City, TN) to my girlfriend's house (Chester, VA) to hang out with her for the weekend.  It's about a 6-7 hour drive.  Normally.

I left Thursday evening after work, checked the bus out and got on the road.  It was raining most of the way up there so I naturally had my wipers on.  I began to notice that my wipers were making more of a clunk sound than normal, mainly they clunked when they reached the end of their leftward travel.  I didn't think much of it, they had always clunked a little.  It didn't bother me much.  Until they stopped.

So here I am on Interstate 81 going 60 mph in pouring rain when my wipers completely stop right in the middle of their travel.  I pull over on the shoulder as quick as I can and put the 4-ways on.  I then try to figure out what the hell is going on.  I fiddle with the switch and I can hear the motor working, not making any strange noises, but the wipers are not moving.  I thought, tho, that it was good that the motor was OK.  So I figure that somehow the wiper linkage has come apart from the motor.  I look in my repair books to see how the whole thing fits together.  

For those of you who haven't pulled out your wiper motors, it's set up like this:  There is a standard electric motor that turns a crank.  This crank is attached with a lever to the wiper linkage under the dash, which converts the motion of the wiper motor crank to the side-to-side motion of the windshield wipers.  The lever is held on to the crank by a single 10 mm nut.  On my bus, the 10 mm nut had apparently loosened over time and had just completely come off of the crank, and subsequently the lever popped off the crank, which stopped the wipers.  I found this out by seeing what I could see under the dash on my '78, which isn't much. 

Well, after I found the nut sitting on top of the fresh air box, I had to put it back on.  If you've ever seen where the wiper motor is in relation to the body of the bus, you know I had an AWFUL time of it.  The nut goes on the front part of the wiper motor, where I had about zero space to get my hand in between the body of the car and the wiper motor.  It took lots of patience, praying, swearing, and blind stupid luck before I finally got the nut on and I was even able to get my 10 mm wrench in there to tighten it.  

So, then I test the wipers.  They work!  Yay!!!  Wait, what the hell is this?  They park right in the middle of the windshield.  I later found out that this was because I had the linkage in the wrong position in relation to the motor crank when I attached it.   I had to move the linkage to attach the nut so I could get my hand in there.  Well, I figured that it was good enough to get me there and it was.  Damn annoying when it wasn't raining tho because the blades parked right in the middle of the windshield.

I made the rest of the trip up there without incident, the rain kept the engine nice and cool, with oil temps below 210 almost the whole way.  No hot start problem going up, not had that problem since I installed the relay.

Friday morning I got to work on permanently fixing the wipers.  I was at my destination by then.  Pulled out the glovebox, and the Y-heater duct under the dash, pulled the wiper arms and then pulled the wiper motor and frame out as a unit.  I thought that would be a bitch of a job, but it wasn't really too bad to pull it.  I got it out and observed where everything need to be to make it work properly, and put it back together as such.  Helps to have a friend to put the wiper motor back in, it's hard to get it aligned with the holes in the front of the bus.  Got that done, and put it all back together.  They even parked in the right place :) .

The rest of Friday was spent hanging out with my girlfriend and doing fun things.

Saturday we went to Busch Gardens in Williamsburg VA.  No mechanical problems whatsoever.  No hot start problems.  And it did get hot, driving on Interstate 64 east going 60 mph oil temps maxed out at around 230.

Coming back that night no problems, oil stayed a lot cooler.  I think Christy inadvertantly named the bus that night.   As we were discussing my mechanical &quot;adventures&quot; with the bus, Christy casually called the bus the Great White Hope (it's a big white bus) as in &quot;We sure hope the bus doesn't break down.&quot;  &quot;I hope I got those wipers fixed.&quot; :) .  I think the name will stick.

Sunday (today) was the day of my return.  Bus gave me no trouble coming back, no problems whatsoever with hot start.  Caught a good bit of rain coming back, no problems or clunking from the wipers.  You can believe I tightened that 10mm nut with everything I had.  I wanted to make sure it never comes off again.  That was not fun.    

And now I'm back and am ready to go to sleep.

BTW, I took some photos of my bus and they came out really well.  I'm gonna scan them in at work and then post them to my web page, so I'll let you folks know when it's all done.
