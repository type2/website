Subject: Re: [T2] Broken Brakes

Hi Juan,
     I too have a '70, and have experienced the very same.  If you KNOW your 
master cyl. is O.K., then it is a front wheel cylinder.  I had even pulled 
the drums and no visible leak to be found.  The cylinder was actually 
'breathing' through the dust boot!  CHange the cylinders on the side 
opposite from the side pulling hard.  That should solve the problem.

&gt;Dear List,
&gt;
&gt;Have a problem with my brakes,  First, I must admit that my 1970 Westy is 
&gt;the first vehicle I've owned without at least front disks or a vacuum 
&gt;assist.  So I'm not sure if what I'm experience is actually a problem or 
&gt;just par for the course.  First,  my brakes do not provide a sense of 
&gt;confidence, seems like I really got to step on the pedal to slow down in 
&gt;any meaningful way.  Secondly, occasionally (very intermittent) when I hit 
&gt;the brakes the van will pull violently to the right and I must counter 
&gt;steer to the left to maintain a straight line.  I've tried bleeding the 
&gt;system but it hasn't helped.  I read the archives and thought the left 
&gt;front brake line might be clogged but wasn't able to determine that no 
&gt;rectify it by bleeding the system.  Bleeding did seem to give the pedal a 
&gt;firmer feel though.
&gt;
&gt;Is this typical? if not any ideas on what to do next?
&gt;
&gt;thanks,
&gt;
&gt;Juan
&gt;
