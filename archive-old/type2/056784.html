hi andy (and volks). i have a 72 westy (among others) and find that the
official vw  manuals have the best wiring diagrams. my one for the station
wagon/bus covers models from '68 thru '74 and has beautiful colour  diagrams
for each of the years. i recommend them highly. my book is now in 4 or 5
pieces as i have read it so much. btw, if you are really stuck i could scan
the 72 pages for you and attach them to an email but, they are for the us
model and from your spelling i can tell your in the uk.
love marty :)
