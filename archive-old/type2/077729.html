Subject: Engine pre-oiler (long)...

Awhile ago somebody posted a link to a page on an engine pre-oiler.
The idea was to use a VW fuel pump to generate oil pressure before turning
the engine on to eliminate the wear from the initial lack of oil.

This makes sense to me, and I would be willing to drop the $$ for the
pump, however I have some questions on what would be the best way to go
about installing such a setup. 

I have now collected all of the parts for my extra oil cooler: cooler,
sandwich adapter, thermostat, fittings and hoses. I like to drive pretty
fast on the highway, so I decided that the extra cooler would be nice. I
have CH Temp, Oil Pressure, and Oil Temp gauges, that I drive by, and am
hoping that the additional cooler (along with the additional oil capacity
provided) will allow me to keep my speed up on long hauls across the
desert.

My thought is that as long as I am working on the cooler, why not install
a pre-oiler pump as well?

So I have three ideas for how I would install the pump. The first is to
inline it into the oil return line. My concern with this setup is the
resistance that the pump would offer to the oil flow when the engine is
running, and the pump is off. Any thoughts as to how much of a drop the
pump might create?

The second is to split the oil return line, and install the pump in
paralel with a check valve. The check valve keeps the pump from pumping
oil backward at startup, and then when the pump is off the resistance of
the setup is low due to the low resistance of the check valve. My concern
here is for the three check valves that would then be in the line. (1 in
filter, 1 in adapter, 1 in return line.)

The last is to T the return line, and T the pressure sender, and connect
the pump between the two like the page described. This would be
much more difficult to route hoses for, but I am willing if the experts
see a reson for this setup that I don't.

Thoughts from those out there in list land with more experience?
