Subject: Re: [T2] VW Resto -- Coralee

I live in Richmond.  

Is there an e-mail address for this person.  There are a few shop about that know what to do with old VW's that I can recommend, and there is an amazing junk yard nearby that has about 200 busses (mostly bays) in it, great for finding hard to find stuff.
