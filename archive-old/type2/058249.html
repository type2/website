Subject: Not sure how to start!

Hi Volks,

A friend of mine just purchased a '74 Transporter , clean cali. machine,
runs good but cannot get it in gear.  He has limited car knowledge and
no VW experience.  And now it falls on my limited experience to get him
moving.

The bus won't arrive at my abode untill Sat. and was hoping for some
pointers so I can prepare myself.  (Read up in Muir and Bentley)

All I know is that it will not go in gear, p.o. had an estimate of $600
to fix, and it used to move.

I am thinking of removing the tranny and engine in one unit (read this
somewhere as being easier than just the engine) then seperating on the
floor.  Starting with a clutch kit, and thurough examination of linkage.

Any help appreciated.
