Subject: Re: Aux. Battery inst. in '72??

I too have a '72 Westy and am contemplating installing a second battery, but you say you have 3???  I would love to have 
three batteries in my bus.  Does anyone know what effect this would have on my alternator?(ie: smoke and fire) I have seen 
the ads in VW Trends for the 85amp drop in replacement alternator for type2's.  Does anyone have one of these? How are they?  
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
