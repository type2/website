After I get my engine tin corrected and the flaps replaced (thanks all) and 
I get my brakes done (remember the exploding rear cylinder?) it will be time 
to replace those cheap, limp passenger car tires.  I have seen some old 
posts recommending load range D for campers and a few favorite brand names.  
What I can't find is what's the proper tire when using a 15 inch wheel on a 
camper (yes, empi wide fives).  Then I can get my beloved bus back on the 
road.  I hope Summer doesn't end before I get all these things done.  ;-)

Thanks for all the kind replies and info.  I know I'm new to VWs but y'all 
make me feel at home rather than an idiot.
