Subject: Re: Is a Microbus a Kombi ?

A Kombi is the base model window van Volkswagen offered.  Its model
number is 23, 231 being a LHD model, 232 RHD and 235 being LHD
with Steel Sliding Roof (sunroof).  Structurally, the Kombi and the Camper
are almost identical.  If you look at the opening in the roof for the
camper,
it is the same opening as for the sunroof.  The Kombi came as a 5 pass.
vehicle, with painted hardboard for side panels in the rear passenger area
and with only the area around the front passengers finished like a normal
bus.  The Kombi has &quot;cal-look&quot; rubber--no aluminum trim around the
windshield or the rear window.  The Kombi has a matte/semigloss painted
interior from the B-pillar rearwards.  The Kombi came stock with stationary
vent windows in the front doors.  If your bus has a fully upolstered
interior,
chances are, you own a Microbus.

Subject: Is a Microbus a Kombi ?


&gt;Hello all,
&gt;
&gt;I'm getting ready to put the &quot;For Sale&quot; signs on my 72 T2 High Top Kombi
&gt;camper and working on the price.
&gt;
&gt;I found a vintage price guide at the Hemmings web site which lists
&gt;values for the 72 VW  &quot;Microbus&quot;  _at_ Fair $2600 / Good $4825 / Excellent
&gt;$7200.
&gt;
&gt;What's the difference between a Microbus and a Kombi ?
&gt;Is the Microbus the regular stock passenger van with bench seat in the
&gt;back .......  and the Kombi the camper conversion ?
&gt;
&gt;If so, would the value for a Kombi camper in good condition be worth
&gt;more, less or the same as a Microbus in similar condition ?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for any help.
