Subject: '76 Starts/Dies, now runs

Thanks to all who responded to my earlier request for help (Monday).  The 
'76 Campmobile started briefly then stopped.

I found that two, approx 1/2&quot;, vacuum lines had become disconnected on the 
fuel injection system.  Upon reconnection the engine then started
immediately.  Tucked in behind the air cleaner housing the hoses weren't 
readily seen from the engine hatch.

Best regards,
Walt Fogle
