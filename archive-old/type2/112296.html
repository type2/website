Subject: Re: [T2] Who did my conversion?

Sure, it'll be a month or more as the van and I are about 350 miles 
apart from one another!  It remains at the mechanic's until I can pay 
for all the repairs to make it roadworthy. Meanwhile, thanks for the 
information on what that was. I figured it was just someone's idea of 
hooking up a coffee pot to the wall! Oh well, my bad.
