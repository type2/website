Subject: cold accelerator cable

it's been really cold here lately.  I know I've whined a little already but it's true!
here's my latest problem, at -14 to 0* F the throttle has been taking 3-5 seconds to return, makes driving a little exciting sometimes.  I think the grease in the cable tube is gelling.  What techniques should I consider to clean that out and how much grease or other lubricant should really be in there?
thanks
