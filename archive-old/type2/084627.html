&gt;Hello all,
&gt;       I've got the dash out of my 71 and I want to repaint it before
&gt;replacing.  Does anyone know what type of black to use i.e.  gloss, satin,
&gt;flat ?  Same goes for engine tin what type of black.  Thanks, Marcus

For the metal part of the dash, I used Rust-Oleum Professional in the tall 
can from Home Depot.  I think it was flat but it might have been 
semi-gloss.  Don't use glossy paint or it will reflect sunlight into your 
eyes.  I sprayed the dash several years ago and it has held up very 
well.  Can't seem to scratch through it and it looks great.
