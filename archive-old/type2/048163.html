Subject: [T2] starter problem

hey volks,
picked my '77 transporter up today and after a hesitant start, she roared to
life for the first time in 4 years...with old gas I gave her some carb
cleaner, and ultimate gas...started again, and drove on home, about 8
miles...ran most electric off and on the ride home to check to see if it
still worked...anyways....no problems, and runs like a top, timing still
amazing, and absolutely purring, I was content. Well, after letting it sit
and run for about 15 minutes to burn out any debris in the lines, I turned
it off. Here's the problem, when going to turn it on again, the engine turns
over very slowly...seems as if the the starter is under powered...tried to
jump start it and the extra juice didn't make any change...turned the engine
over by hand, no problem seems to turn over smoothely....so...my question
is,

is the automatic starter and the manual starter that much different, size,
strength?  for some reason the manual starter costs TWICE as much as the
auto starter...any ideas?
its possible the alternator is bad or vibrated loose a connection, anyone
know if a bad voltage regulator would cause battery drain?

anyways, I appreciate the help, this is the first day of the beginning of
Happy's restoration....

p.s. anyone know of original or replacement carpet for order?
