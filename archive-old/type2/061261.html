Subject: Blowers for cabin heat on Type 1 engines

For Type 1 engines, you see a lot of ideas on the list and commercial products
for electric blowers that pull air through the heat exchangers.
                                 HEAT EXCHANGERS -&gt; BLOWER(S) -&gt; CABIN

Is there a reason for this?

I do not like this approach because the heat exchanger tin is not air tight. 
Pulling air through the heat exchanger can also suck in fumes.  Pushing air
through the heat exchangers reduces the changes/volume of fumes (blower-&gt;heat
exchangers-&gt;cabin).  Maybe this is why Type 4 engines have blowers set up this
way?
