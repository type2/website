Subject: timing screwed up

A friend that just bought a bus (standard 1600 upright motor) didn't 
check the timing before he pulled the distributor to inspect the numbers 
on the back and when he put it back in, he timed it &quot;correctly&quot;.  The 
dwell is right on 50, but the thing runs terribly.  He says it backfires 
and just plugs along at far less power than it had.  He kept it at idle 
and turned the distributor till he got the best rpm and it turned out to 
be about 15 to 20  degrees btdc (he says).

I seem to remember a posting to this effect some months ago but cannot 
find it on the archives (being difficult to use cause I'm frames 
disadvantaged).

My type 4 motor doesn't do this so I can't help him and he's not a 
computer type.  Anyone with some advice I can pass along?
