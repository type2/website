Yeah, your right, you need to cut and weld the front beam - probably one
of the most difficult suspension systems to lower. But, its been done
quite a few times, and its not that hard (well, I managed it!) I've
written a set of detailed notes on the procedure, if you're interested
pmail me and I'll send them on!

RE:	Lower my 73 Transporte suspension.


[...]
One of the most important project that I have in mind is to lower it
about 2 or 3 inches and need some advise. Can anyone give me a hint on
this ??.  I can go on and do the rear job with no problem but the front
is what freaks me, I understand it needs some cutting and welding.  I'm
ready to listen to any suggestion on how should I start.
