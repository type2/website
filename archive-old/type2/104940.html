Subject: RE: ADMIN: Re: Still bouncing my posts

WOW, so Everyone with a Yahoo email address is getting bounced messages to
the Type2 and Vintagebus lists?! This must be quite a few people. Is there
anything we can do about it (other than finding a new IP??)
Thanks, John Baker

John,

Yahoo has taken to hosting spammers and not stopping them once again.

Some of your _at_buszen_dot_com email is being sent through yahoo servers that
are listed with SPEWS.  See http://spews_dot_org/ask.cgi?S1928 for more
information on SPEWS.

You need to contact your ISP and strongly suggest that they correct this
problem.  You should reference the following evidence file:
