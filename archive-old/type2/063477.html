Subject: Re: CD Player in Buses

&gt; 
&gt; I want to put an new stereo with a CD player in my '77. I talked to 
&gt; some guy at the local &quot;we sell you big huge stereos&quot; store and he said 
&gt; I might eventually have problems with as it ages due to the angle it 
&gt; will sit in the dash. Most cars the stereo goes in level, in the buss 
&gt; it will sit at a downward angle.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone had trouble with there CD players?=20
&gt; 
&gt; If its just going to wear out faster I won't spend as much money on it.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,

Patrick,
I have a Sony CD player in my dash.  The owner's manual for the CD
player says not to mount the unit in an installation where it will be
tilted more than 20 degrees from vertical.  I don't know how much my bus
tilts, but I've not had any problems with undue skipping, etc.  It seems
to be ok.

Sean
