Subject: Re: [T2] Re Bizarre failing in 75 FI; fuel liny query

 We had a similar problem and it turned out to be a foam disc that seals the
lid of the fuel additive the PO had poured into the tank. The little thing
would float around in there for a while and suddenly land on the fuel
pickup, thus starving the pump. We diagnosed this roadside by clamping the
line,  blowing in and releasing clamp simultaneously in order to dislodge
the thing long enough to get it to where we could pull the tank and remove
it. Then years later some may remember I had the same problem again but with
a glob of Seal-all ................ longer dumber story.
Anyhow your tank might be clean as a whistle but that doesn't mean there's
nothing in it.
Something else to ponder.
