Wow. I'm amazed at the replies - I have had about 60 so far of people
who want to hear more... Just to give you an idea...some of the things
he mentioned:

1) He went while they were still building the Trans Sahara Road (?) and
because of the rocks they put on the constructed part (until they were
finished, I'm guessing) he was forced to drive about 6 feet off of the
road for the first 100 miles or so, then...nothing.

2) He said that in Zaire, parts for type 2s are so common, you can get
about anything for a dime. He recalls buying a set of wheels, tires, and
a windsheild side along with various spare motor parts (including a
generator, fan/shroud setup and carb) for $10 (This was only 20 years
ago, folks!)

3) The road, for about 1/2 of the 15,000 miles was a matter of a 1/2
mile wide strip of sand with brush and tire tracks to follow. Most of
the time was spent trying to avoid the bigger (1 foot or deeper) holes,
and digging himself out of the sand.

4) He said that everywhere he went, people were only too anxious to have
him have dinner and a soft bed in exchange for news from the outside
world and conversation about his bus-travels. I guess, though people
were moderately common touristwise, not many trusted the locals enough
to give them more than a hassle for gas prices. He couldn't believe the
hospitality and open friendliness everywhere he went. He remembers
Tanzania being particularly friendly.

It sounds like a blast to me. I'll have to talk more of this with him,
and get some pix on the net.

BTW, after he got to S. Africa, he spent about 2 years working with his
wife, and then sold the bus, bought a sailboat, and spent 3 years
sailing back up to the US Virgins. Life's rough, eh?
