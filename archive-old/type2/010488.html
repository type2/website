&gt; We are in the process of adjusting the valves on my buddies bus and heres the
&gt; problem.  at 180 back the rotor points to number 3 not 2 and the valve is
&gt; super tight at 180 back.  so we moved the crank until the rotor pointed at
&gt; the number 2 plug wire but that's only 90 rotor and pulley degrees not 180

I¹m not sure exactly where you stand on this project so I¹ll assume nothing
about the car, you and your buddy:

First question: was the motor running *before* the adjustment, or have you
just finished some rebuild? (IOW, could the cam or distributor shaft be way
way off?)

Next: any history on the engine? Is this the first time your buddy has
worked on it?

Assuming it was working before you started and that your buddy is unfamiliar
with his bus, you can use some Auto Repair 101 methods to find out what¹s
the story with this motor. One of you can rotate the engine (clockwise)
through a few turns while the other observes the rockers. If you follow the
³zundfolge² you should see each cylinder go through a cycle of intake open
for 1/2 turn, both closed for 1 turn, exhaust open for 1/2 turn. At some
point, the pulley will be at 0 or 180, both valves on cylinders 1 &amp; 4 will
have clearance and intake 3 and exhaust 2 will be open (no clearance). The
rotor will now be pointing to the #1 connection in the distributor cap
(where the #1 wire hopefully is connected). If the motor ran before, you
will see this. It¹s forged in steel. Literally.

Of course, if you just finished a re-build or had the distributor shaft out
and this isn¹t so, then you have a different problem.

Did you feel the 5.something out that way this morning? I hope you are using
*good* jackstands.
