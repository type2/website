&gt; &gt;Would it be possible to install the engine and tranny and camper equipment

&gt; 
&gt; But if the chassis is good enough, this is a swap that reaps good results 
&gt; with extensive re-engineering of the manual to auto shifter and tranny 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  The tranny is a stock automatic.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope other's will correct me if I'm wrong, but the tranny should bolt 
&gt; right up with the axles from the 79. The mounts and shifter are another 

the half shafts from the auto tranny are different than the manual and are
not interchangable.  the axle stubs are the same.

&gt; I would consider selling or trading the auto and put in a manual to 
&gt; eliminate chassis conversion to auto, but that's me.

don't have a manual but if you decide to get rid of the auto tranny give
me a hollar
