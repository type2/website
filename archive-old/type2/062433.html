Kirk,

I wouldn't trust an engine rebuilt by someone who quit in frustration and
I would pull it at the first sign of trouble. Anyway, you might want to
change the oil if you haven't done so yet and again 300 miles later since
you don't know how much of a break-in it got after the rebuild. 

Oil out of the dipstick tube?? Is the dipstick not in there?

Bad turn signal switch: maybe it's simply the relay; if not, maybe a
lurking spare parts dealer will reply to you privately. Otherwise, junk
yard.

Holes in tin: don't know how big the holes are, but yes, you should close
them. Or put the A/C back in its place, even if you don;t reinstall the
belt.

Good luck!

Sami
