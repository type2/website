Subject: Re: [T2] Heat Without Heater Boxes?/Conversions

Thousands of gas heaters have been used since the 20's in everything from
cars, trucks, tanks and even airplanes.  There is nothing wrong with using a
gas heater, in fact it is the BEST and cleanest way to heat a VW.  If the
heater is working correctly, there is MUCH less chance of any CO getting
into your bus than there is with the stock heaters.

Do you have a forced air furnace in your house, or do you just put on more
clothes when it gets cold?  A gasoline heater in your VW is NO DIFFERENT
than a forced air furnace in your house!!!!  I don't think you really know
how they work.    

But hey, if you don't like your BN4, I'll take it off your hands :)

&gt; I have one of those bombs, I believe a BN4, in the back.  My Corvair
&gt; conversion did not have the heater boxes hooked up.  The gas heater by
&gt; itself was not too effective in the rear and ridiculously dangerous.
