Subject: loose wire??

Symptoms:  when I make a low speed hard right turn, like in the city or in a 
parking lot, my wipers stop dead, and my headlights go out.

It doesn't happen on a similar left hand turn.

It 'sounds' like a loose wire, but are the wipers and the head lights on the 
same circuit??

No, the VW does not stall...

TIA
