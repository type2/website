Subject: RE: Cold Weather Running

I still have this same problem and this is the second winter I have been
running the bus.  There seems to be a fine line between working and not
working.  If I start the engine cold and the temperature out is below about
10 degrees C, the engine cuts out after the chokes have come off.  My chokes
are adjusted correctly AFAIK, timing and dwell are spot on, valves likewise,
coil good, thermostat and flaps there and working.  There don't seem to be
any vacuum leaks.
I have found that if I run the engine until the chokes come off (at which
point the engine will die if I touch the pedal to release the fast idle
cam), then wait a few minutes and start up again, the engine does not cut
out again all day.  This leads me to believe that it may be the air intake
preheat that isn't working, because leaving the engine to stand allows heat
to rise to the upper reaches and take the chill off the carbs etc.
How can I tell if the preheat system is working or not?  I should point out
here that I have a type 4 engine with the rectangular air cleaner and the
thermostatic / vacuum flap on the right hand side.  Is it a case of taking
the assembly out and warming it up / sucking on the hose etc?
