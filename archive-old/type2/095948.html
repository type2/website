I do not think that the wood slats are an OEM thing on your model.  They
were on earlier SC's, though....someone added them onto yours and thus the
headache.

Subject: [T2] sealing treasure chest leaks on pickups


&gt; hey folks, does anyone know how the wood slats are supposed to be mounted
&gt; on pickup beds?  My 74 SC simply has screws going through the wood slats
&gt; into the metal floor and when I'm driving in the rain, the treasure chest
&gt; gets very wet inside.  I would assume there should be some type of rubber
&gt; washer thingy under there but can't find any literature on the
&gt; subject.  tia, Greg
