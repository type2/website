(In fact, if you buy the Bosch-rebuilt
version, which has a core deposit, you're required to return the same
model core as the one you bought.)
-------------------------------
Ron, where on the site does it state that?  No where I saw. I was not told
this when I ordered.  Just that I would have to return a core!!!  So now I
am out $55 (I think) Thanks alot!!!

You also mentioned something about  ..&quot;we're not mind readers&quot;.  Well I have
ordered parts in the past from Bus Depot (online) only to have my order
CANCELLED, because they said the part would not fit my bus!!! They called
and left a message on my home phone.    The thing was, I wasn't buying it
for my bus but getting a part for a friend in my order to save on shipping.
And I had to call back and have it added back to my order which had already
shipped out.   This time I told my operator (I always pay for the call
because I want a more knowledgeable person) that this was going on a 73 bus
and there was no mention of anything...

So make up your minds.. Are you going to cancel orders because the item
won't fit or just let the person order and not tell them.  I am on the bad
end of the stick no matter how I order...

I have more issues with a current order but will pmail.
