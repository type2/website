Subject: bus sighting on tv

I dont know if it was a re-run or not,

but last night on &quot;Boston Public&quot; a drama on Fox, there was a bus scene.

the show is set in a high-school, and a teacher finds out that one of her 
students is homeless, she and her mother areliving in a Bus.  There is a 
scene where the teacher goes to find the bus, and then on several occasions 
the teacher trys to get other adults to help by saying............&quot;for god's 
sake Stephen, she is living in a Volkswagen, a Volkswagen, she is living in 
a Volkswagen.&quot;

Wish I had it on tape :-)
