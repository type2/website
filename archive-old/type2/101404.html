Subject: I want the true story about... (carb stuff)

Hi again guys,
Here my story!
I have a 73 bus with stock 1700cc (mid life engine, I have a second one 
that I am rebuilding right now)!
http://pages.infinit_dot_net/engine/test.htm  
I've been struggling with my Solex for 4 month, mostly a butterfly shaft 
problem!!!!!!!!!!!! My first rebuilt:
http://www.letambourin_dot_com/west_carbu_rebuilt1.htm
was a beginner rebuilt and I did make some mistake! Still! Now I have 
(just bought some for 40$) 13 x used Solex 32-34 PDSIT-3/2 and 4 rebuilt 
kit + I just bought 1 NEW still in box right 32-34 PDSIT-3!!!! For 30$.
So know I am rebuilding 1 left 32-34 PDSIT-2 (I have 6), I just had the 
butterfly shaft re-bush by my old school (Aeronautic) teacher.

In a week, I should have some &quot;Almost&quot; perfect Solex 32-34 PDSIT-3/2.
THIS IS MY LAST ATTEMP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So to my question! If they give me one bit of trouble!!! They all go in 
THE GARBAGE CAN, I DON'T CARE!!!!!

Ho yhea, I forgot the meaning of this post!!!!!!!!!!!!! (am I pissed off 
or not!!!)
I can get a 1-year-old complete single Weber 32/36 progressive 2 bbl for 
under $100, I perfectly know about carb icing!!!! (Am a pilot) but my 
question is the following: Who is using the Weber? What are your 
comments in general?

Here is my dilemma, I have 2 westy friend, both have the single weber 
(2000cc and 1800cc), the one with the 2000cc is having so much problem 
with the webber, the other one, NONE, his bus run very good with the 
weber!!!! (no winter driving of course)

I know it's an old subject! Bur still, I would like some comment about 
those who are using the single weber, not the one who only have comment 
about something they never had!!!!!

Many thanks, I do appreciate your comment, Ben

ps.: I am leaving for the southern states and Mexico in 3 weeks (am from 
Montreal, Canada)!!!!!!!! So the Solex will have to do for this trip!!!!
