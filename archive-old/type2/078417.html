&gt;I have looked everywhere, including an infamous auction site and can't find
&gt;the maker of the engine starter that clamps onto your engine allowing you to
&gt;start an engine on the bench. I know someone must know where to find one.

I took a SawsAll to a junk tranny and cut the bellhousing off specifically
so I could bolt in on and mount a starter for bench work. It just happened
that I had replaced a tranny and the old one was not needed as a core and
was in my and everyone elses way. Also salvage the input shaft as the ideal
VW/Porsche clutch alignment tool.

Check the junk yards for trash trannys. Every VW rail dune-buggy hobbist
has busted trannys laying around. Check also with tranny rebuilders who
from time to time will have a cracked tranny case that can't be otherwise
used. Cut the bellhousing so you have the starter mount and the motor mount
hole below it included.
