Subject: Re: [T2] Friday crying, 

well apparently the preson who sold me the transimssion I just put into my
bus considers &quot;in good condition&quot; to mean only in reverse.. since that is
the only direction it will go................

which brings the next point

Anyone in the Mid Atlantic Area have a GOOD working .010 late bay auto
transmission avaliable for a reasonable price??

anyone able to do a decent rebuild in a reasonable period of time at a
fair price??

shall I spit into the wind also????

mumble mumble grumble grumble.... at least the other one went both ways,
if not very well.........

got some good cores??

Bob
