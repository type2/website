Hi All,

During the lay-up season for my Westy, and just when I'm not driving it,
I use a product called Damp Away, which I purchase at my local marine
store, ( Boat US ) and all it is, is calcium chloride in 1 lbs.
containers.
 
I put three of them inside the bus, with aluminum pie plates under them
to catch any moisture overflow just in case.

I been using this product in the cabin area of my boat for many years.

Works good, to assist in keeping the cabin dry.  

The only advantage, I would think other than buying the big bag, is
convenience.

And it's not that expensive at all----couple three bucks per container

Later,

            ______________
