Subject: Re: [T2] Tube for between the upper and lower brake
  reservoirs...

Unfortunately, you can't get these new. You absolutely have to find a
good used one. Do not try to substitute it with a different kind of
tubing. Fuel/air hose is not suitable because the brake fluid will eat
away at it AND it is extremely important to get the tube the right
shape. Since the master cylinder and dual circuit reservoir sit below
the filler reservoir, air needs to be able to escape from the lower
reservoir to the upper. If you use anything other than a factory tube,
air bubbles will get trapped in that tube, I've seen it. Not to
mention that it would be severely crimped and misformed to get in that
shape to begin with.

bustedbus can sell you a good used one.

Be careful to get one for your year bus. I believe '74-'79 are
different that than '71-73 and different from '68-'71. The tube
connects to a different spot in the dual circuit reservoir due to
changes/addition in the brake servo. I'm sure the folks at Bustedbus
could get you the right one if you tell them what you need.

Make sure you get some new rubber sleeves for both ends of the tube.

&gt; Is there a part number for this hard plastic tube that goes from the brake
&gt; fluid reservoir under the driver seat to the reservoir on top of the master
&gt; cylinder?
