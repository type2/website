Subject: '73 Wiring diagram

While we're beating this repair manual/procedure thing to death, does
anybody have a color wiring diagram for the '73 Bus? Is there a more
&quot;conventional&quot; wiring diagram out there somewhere? (probably not) By
conventional, I mean more like the schematics for the older cars, which
were color in the old factory manual and a couple German repair manuals
I've got.

I'm good with schematics/wiring diagrams, having done a lot of TV &amp;
radio repair as a kid, but I've always had trouble with the newer Bus
wiring diagrams. Once they couldn't fit it on one page, it got _really_
bizarre! (IMHO)
