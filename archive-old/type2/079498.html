david raistrick sends:

&gt; Then problem that I see with this is that you can very easily OVER cool
&gt; your engine...the oil never warms up, which never brings the rest of the
&gt; engine up to temp...and of course, you dont get much heat.

But what if you were to only send a little oil through the aux cooler? The
three-way valves act as mixer valves (this being their actual purpose--
they're used in factories to blend two chemicals into one stream) so you
could send some oil into the cooler and some straight back into the engine.
