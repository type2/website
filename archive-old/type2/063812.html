Folks,

Thought I'd just share a couple of things with people who understand.

Took my '72 bus to Sydney (325 mile round trip) last weekend to help my 
daughter move some furniture. Bus seemed bouncier in the front end 
without the middle seat. Could have been my imagination. Won't know 'til 
I do the trip with the seat in.

Had a flat in the left rear while going down the mountains. Never had a 
flat in the Kombi while driving before. Now, I know that the steering box 
needs an overhaul. So when Kombi starts weaving when I change lanes 
and/or go around bends I'm thinking these better roads sure show up the 
deficiencies in the steering. By the time I'm going down the escarpment 
onto the western freeway, Kombi is getting scary. Sort of weaves a bit 
then settles down when I change lanes. All of this at 90Ks (80Ks is 50 mph). 
Thinking about trying to tighten up the steering box, for the trip home, 
when I get to my daughter's. Thinking I don't need the expense of a 
reconditioned steering box at the moment.

So anyway, hooting along in the slow lane worrying, etc, when a Toyota Ute 
comes alongside and bips the horn. The passenger does the sign language 
pointing to the back of Kombi, large movement of mouth thing, to tell me 
I've got a &quot;FLAT TYRE&quot;. Give him the wave of thanks and pull over. Much 
relief to find I've only got a flat. Out with the wheel brace and the 
Bilstein jack, changed in no time. Spare's a bit down so take the Penrith 
exit, find a servo and put in some air. Actually took me longer to wait 
for the pump to be free than it took to change the tyre.

Kombi went great on the trip home. Got 25.5mpg (Imperial) so I'm happy 
about that.

Every time I take it anywhere I realise what a great combination the 1776 
with twins Kadrons is. The torque for hill climbing is great. I can just 
imagine the faces of people as they're thinking &quot;Old Kombis can go that 
fast&quot;. 

The other thing is, that I was talking to my son and he announced that 
he's thinking of getting a VW (YES!!). He's driven Kombi a few times 
(before and after the 1776) and loves the new engine, but, of course, 
it's not quite fast enough. He wants to get a Type 3 Station Wagon and do 
the lowered, wide tyres, big engine thing. Says that he can't help 
turning his head to look every time he hears a VW. This is after talking 
about BMWs for some time (his sister's boyfriend's family has a fleet of 
2002s). He's only 19 so these things are important. I'm pleased he's seen 
the light.
