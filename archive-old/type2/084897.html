Subject: Re: [T2] Gathering group to help engine drop  (Troy's bus)


&gt;While this is on a T1 engine in a beetle, when I pulled it a few
&gt;months ago the cam plug was completely sealed w/ sealant of some sort.
&gt;It appears to have completely stopped the leaking that was apparently
&gt;going on before this &quot;repair&quot;. I would say for a temporary fix it
&gt;works, but you would always have that nagging feeling in your brain
&gt;that you have to fix it correctly in the future.

JB Weld until he has the time to tear it down - like post-baby delivery?

That is only my suggestion - I have never actually used JB Weld for 
anything. I keep waiting for a chance...

Well OK maybe it was really a question...

Would JB work for this application (cam plug)?
