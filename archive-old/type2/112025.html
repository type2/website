Subject: Re: [T2] Front End Swap (was Spinning Wheel)

&gt; Rather than swap only the axles, I am
&gt; thinking of simply unbolting the whole front end (suspension, brakes,
&gt; steering, ect...) and swapping the whole thing to avoid all of the
&gt; disassembly and reassembly.

&gt; It appears that all that is required is to
&gt; disconnect the shift linkage, brake hoses, remove the vacuum brake servo and
&gt; connecting rod, and then the four big bolts on each side, swap the whole
&gt; puppy, reassemble, and bleed the brakes. Has anyone done this?

Yes.  Count on a full weekend for this job.

&gt; Thoughts? Suggestions? Anything I have missed?

You missed a couple of items but you will discover them as the beam comes
down.  The clutch cable and drag link will have to be disconnected for
instance.  The job as you describe it is possible but the trailing arms
are usually removed as the beam alone is very heavy.  Adding the trailing
arms and steering knuckle will double the weight.  You will need at least
three people and a jack to do this job safely.

                             OOK!
