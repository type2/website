Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Balancing in VA/MD/DE

Rick,

Thanks for the words of encouragement.  This will be my first engine build 
so I'm still just trying to get all the information on things like 
balancing.  

I had planned on balancing rods but it sounds like i'll be doing the 
pistons as well. Buying a reasonable digital scale (or using the one at 
work) seems like the way to go to get the job done with the most accuracy.  

What I wasn't sure how to do was balancing things like my flywheel, 
pulley, and fan, and/or balancing the assembly, which I had heard was 
important (or at the very least: &quot;could be beneficial).  I'd love to do it 
myself, but thought it would require tools I didn't have access to.

Similarly, I'm sure I'll have more questions when it comes to 
volumetrically balancing, but that sounds fairly straightforward.

Thanks!

ps oh, and good tip on matching the pistons, i don't think I had heard 
that before.

&gt; balance the rods first, mark the weight on each, then weigh the pistons with
&gt; the pins and mark those too.  Matching the heaviest piston with the lightest
&gt; rod and so on I can get the sets matched very closely.  There may be a
&gt; little grinding on a rod or two, but you can really come close this way.  I
&gt; also put the two heaviest sets on either number 1 and 3 or 2 and 4 that way
&gt; they offset each other.
