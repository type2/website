Subject: Help!! I need some advice..Oil change from Hell!!

I need some advice....Today I gave my 71 Campmobile an oil change....I undid 
the  big bolt in the middle..Let all the greasy love out...Then I ever so 
gingerly coaxed the six little screws out..however two of them did not come 
out...The heads of the screws came off...but the stem remained in there....So 
I figured maybe they were permanent studs..So then I tried putting everything 
back together..and it is not working....gasket..then oil filter..then another 
gasket..and then the bottom part...put the 4 screws back in..but the studs do 
not show through...I am confused and I need help...Thanks Alot..Adam
