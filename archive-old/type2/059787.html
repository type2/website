This reminds me of when I had a wire break off the back of the keyswitch in my
'69 rustbox. It would touch and then not. (or so I found out later) After a
greasy sweaty humid (miami, summer, 4 pm, side o' road) miserable time. An
inspired alligator clip from the batt+ to the coil+ and I was off.
I drove with the clip-on / clip-off for a week until I found the time and
energy to sort it out.
Good luck
