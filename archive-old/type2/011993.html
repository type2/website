Hey Justin,

Didn't you once tell us that you were into the Type 2
scene BECAUSE of it's lack of speed?  Now if you go
putting a turbo on to the engine, you might as well go
all the way and put a Porsche 930 tranny in there with
a Chevy Vortec V-6 transplant and get yourself into
some REAL trouble.

Paul
