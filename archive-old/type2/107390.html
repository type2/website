Subject: '73 Brake Wiring Harness into a '71

I put a late bay master cylinder into a '71.  The PO hacked the wires out of
the bus way up front and just had a couple spade connectors hooked up to an
old splitty M/C.  I snipped the harness out of a '73 to make up the
difference.  There are four wires coming out of the bus: 2 black, one black w/
red stripe, and one red.  The harness has six wires: 2 black, 2 black w/
orange stripe, and 2 red.
