Subject: Re: [T2] Type 2 recruits and Type 2 fliers

I have a Type2_dot_com sticker on the back window of my Westy. I got it 
from the list a few years ago when I made a cash donation to help 
keep things going.

&gt;Hello List,
&gt;
&gt;Well it is Friday. I had a Friday Question. I have
&gt;seen many bay window busses lately in town. A couple
&gt;of these busses were for sale, some needed some TLC
&gt;and a one or two were restored, beautiful models. I
&gt;think that the owners of these busses could really
&gt;benifit and/ or contribute to the list. My thought was
&gt;to make up a Type 2 flier that tells what the Type 2
&gt;Websight and Type 2 list is about. I thought that
&gt;whenever I saw one of these parked busses in parking
&gt;lots or else where, I could stick one of these fliers
&gt;under the busses' windshield wiper. Does this sound
&gt;like a good or bad idea. I would like to see some list
&gt;bus owners from my own town on the list.
&gt;
&gt;Let me know what you think.
&gt;
