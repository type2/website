Hi Melissa,

My guess is DPD used only York (R209R) aluminum
compressors.  On my 1980 Westy the compressor mounts
on a massive 3/8 inch plate on the left side of the
engine, just above the exhaust and heat exchanger
(perfect place to cook a compressor ha ha). The belt
from the crankshaft pulley drives the York compressor
directly with no other step down pulleys (like I've
seen with some Sanyos).

The controls, however, are probably the best clue. 
DPD controls for the AC are rather complicated and
consist of three knobs.  Two of these knobs operate
separate condensor fans (along with evap fans, and the
compressor clutch).  The center knob controls the
amount of cooling.  It's a little kludgey looking but
it works.

Rob
