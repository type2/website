&gt; Meanwhile we got a letter from our insurance # that says the manufacturer has

&gt; read some of the archives and thought maybe if I posted it here someone might
&gt; be able to help solve the mystery. . .
&gt; 
&gt; The VIN is 2242110330  on the title this number is preceded by 003 in
&gt; parenthesis.  I don't know what that is about.

part of the problem is that VIN numbers now have 14 digits and the older
VWs' only have 10 and many computers kick em out automatically as
invalid.  I know when I go to the inspection station the vin is routinely
rejected and a manager has to come over and enter a special password and
overide the computer, funny thing is the computer prints out the correct
information based on the VIN when it is finally entered and accepted...
