Subject: Turn signal &amp; emerg. flasher gone, 71 Westy, Help!

Hi all,

Starting today I have no turn signals or emergency flasher in my ‘71 Westy. Both
worked fine before today. When I flip the turn signal all I get is a ticking sound.
Both arrows on the gauge light up and stay lit, but don’t function correcting.
Numbers 8 and 12 fuses (turn signal &amp; emergency flasher) are ok. I do have head,
tail, and parking lights.
I’ve found 1 question concerning this in the archives, but nobody answered the
question. After looking at the Bentley manual I’m inclined to think the problem is
the emergency flasher relay. Looking for your help. Thanks
