&gt; Boy, is this a Friday topic!

&gt; I was at a major airport recently and saw a lot of limos. The usual lincolns
&gt; and Caddies, but also a PT Cruiser. So here's my question:
&gt;
&gt; Has anybody ever lengthened a Bus? Preferably a camper. I don't mean
&gt; lengthened to limo standards, but adding two or three feet to the passenger
&gt; compartment. I can't help thinking that would make it 'campier'.

There are quite a few stretch buses out there.  There was one around here
made from two 21 (or maybe 23) window buses, making it something like 29
or 31 windows!  The interior had a major teen-pleaser stereo system.

I've seen at least three stretch buses at BBB.  Two had mid-engine V8s,
solving the power probem.  The other was an original paint bus from a VW
shop that had been recently saved from a back lot somewhere
