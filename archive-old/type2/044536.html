Subject: [T2] Side lens and gas leak

I'm wondering if any one has a source for the part that the orange lens
attaches to on the front side marker on a 1977 bus.

I can get the one for the back marker with a bulb holder but not the front
marker with no bulb in it? It's a flat plastic plate that presses in to the
door, then you can screw the lens on I think mines so shattered It's hard to
tell?(I have the lens). It looks like it would be hard (if possible?) to
take off a donor bus without breaking?

Just finished a MN to MI trip about 1800 mi, poptop bus ran like a dream,
three of us slept in it for ten days and were quite comfortable.

One misshape and a lesson. I had replaced what I thought was all the gas
lines as many suggest on the list. Coming out off a gas station after
filling up at 12:30am my wife points out a puddle of gas under the back of
the bus! I crawl under to find a small rubber hose broken that I had missed
connecting the expansion tubes that go up and curve in the air duct above
the battery on the drivers side. It must have been a new pump that over
filled the tank, otherwise I don't think gas would have gone up this 1/4&quot;
tube, we put a new 2&quot; tubing and were on our way. Something to check!

Another hint for a trip. We found that one of those new fangled metal,
small, fold up scooters that can hold 300lbs (I'm a big guy) fit nicely in
or on top of a bus, we used it when parked at friends to run to store and at
camp grounds. While waiting for a ferry in the middle of the night (that
goes across Lake Michigan) my 6' 14 yr old got it out and soon had the 40 or
so Harley riders in their leathers trying it out so I know they are sturdy.
Yes, it would look silly but it would make that unexpected out of gas walk
for a gal of gas lots easier.
