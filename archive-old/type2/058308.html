Subject: Re: Air flow

Dear Listees,

I don't post too often, but I'll kick in my $.02 worth on this one...

Craig commented that

&gt; I think the Kamm Effect is one of those 'better but not perfect' items - a
&gt; teardrop shape WOULD reduce drag as much as possible, but then you'd have a
&gt; bus 20 feet long!
&gt;
Sometimes yes, sometimes no... the air flowing over the surface causes a
bit of friction itself, so if the surface is smaller (e.g. the back end
is chopped off like our busses) the resulting skin friction drag is
reduced.  If the airflow's already turbulent, then it doesn't make a
huge difference, but if  the vehicle designers have done a good job and
the flow is laminar (smooth), an abrupt end to the body is just peachy.
As with most things in life, it's a tradeoff...

Maybe I'll take a crack at calculating out some Bus aerodynamics; if so,
I'll pass the results on to the List.

Mike B's question was if

&gt; &gt;leaving off the
&gt; &gt;plates under the cylinders/heads that block the direct flow downwards of
&gt; &gt;cooling air and direct it to the rear...  causes &quot;stagnant&quot; air
&gt; &gt;to cyl. # 1 and 3, making them hotter?
&gt;
While moving lots of air is generally a good thing when it comes to
cooling, there's a tradeoff (that word again ;-) ) between heat transfer
and pressure; the air slows down around the baffle plates, increasing in
pressure as it does so, and thereby picking up *more* heat from the
cylinders.  Hopefully, Volkswagen engineers spent lots of time getting
this dialed in, and I know Bob Hoover spent lots of time figuring out
why they had done what they did.  So unless I feel inclined to embark on
an R&amp;D program of my own, I think I'll keep all my tin just as
Volkswagen designed it.

I did my best not to get techhie in the descriptions here, at the risk
of being less than rigorous... if I left anything obvious out or phrased
it wrong, I'm sure someone (George Lyle?) will let us know! :-)

Thanks, everyone, for such a great List!
