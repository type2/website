&gt; Hi All,
&gt; I've got a dilemma facing me. I'm looking at buying a 1982 Westy with
&gt; 135,000 miles on it. PO took very good care it. He decided to put a rebuilt
&gt; motor in it about 7000 miles ago. He bought a GEX built motor and installed
&gt; it himself.  He then took the bus on it's annual summer trip (had about
&gt; 3000 miles on the newly rebuilt engine). Well  the heads on his new
&gt; creation gave out while traveling through Iowa. GEX refused to warranty
&gt; anything because he did the install himself. Not wanting to make the same
&gt; mistake twice he had Jerry's Bug Shop (?) in Iowa rebuild the heads and
&gt; install new pistons in the GEX case. He then drove the van home and has put
&gt; some 4000 miles on the new, new engine rebuild since then.
&gt; 
&lt;snip&gt; compression is bad (#1 I believe) and the
&gt; rings are likely shot.  The owner of the vehicle (not me as of yet) was
&gt; very saddened by this news and offered to sell the van to me at a greatly
&gt; reduced rate (basically took out the price of a top end rebuild and a
&gt; little more).
&gt; 
&gt; My mechanic is telling me that GEX is bad news in general and that it's
&gt; possible that there is &quot;something&quot; about the case/cam etc that is
&gt; destroying heads/rings et al.
&lt;snip&gt;
 I
&gt; really would like to know what it could be in this GEX  case which could
&gt; destroy two engines in less than 7000 miles.
&gt; 
&gt; Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Ian:
This story ties in nicely with the story of one of my long term type 2
relationships. It seems that when I bought my 78 Champagne Edition in
1982 it was sitting at Jerry's Bug Shop in Des Moines, having only
48,000 miles, but Jerry's had just put in 1 new piston and a valve job.
I think Jerry's are slow learners! When you fix broken engines maybe you
should try to find the cause of the problem and not just treat symptoms.
We bought this van, marveled at how stong and quiet it was, took a
vacation to California in it, and after only 2,000 miles the exhaust
valves were so burned that it wouldn't start with the starter! We limped
back home, called up Jerry and of course he'd do nothing. I replaced the
motor and eventually traced the problem to a faulty temp sensor 1
(inside the AFM).
I don't know how long a 2.0 liter motor should last under normal
circumstances in a Vanagon, maybe somewhat less than in a loaf. It would
seem that 200,000 miles in a loaf is not unusual. If a motor fails from
burnt valves or roasted pistons/rings and it has rather low miles, temp
sensor 1 should be suspect. One very suspect characteristic that mine
exibited was extreme overrichness at low temperatures (below 0F.). I
think the opposite was happening also at high ambient temperatures- that
is, too lean.
There are probably ways to check this but it really needs to be checked
under load- an oxy-sensor mixture checker like Gene Berg sells would be
great. Putting on a new AFM SHOULD have fixed it, but that was not the
end of the story. It would barely run! After talking to several people I
found out that the Bosch replacement AFM's are set way tight so as to
pass smog tests in California. Popping the cover and reducing the spring
preload by 10-12 stops (?) (it has been 15 years) made it run like a
tiger!
So, my guess is that there's nothing wrong with the short block, I'd
check the cylinders for wear and scoring, check the piston for collapsed
ring lands and ring side groove clearance, put in new rings if they
pass, fix the guides and the exhaust valves (the intakes are probably
fine, but a good shop could do them better), and reassemble it with a
new AFM installed. Finding a good shop to fix the heads, that's a
problem. We have good industrial/performance shops around here and they
are even quite able to shrink in new seats using liquid nitrogen. This
is not rocket science; most diesel shops use liquid nitrogen to shrink
in sleeves. Find out where the race car boys go, take along your Bentley
manual for seat widths, make sure they check and/or replace the exhaust
guides.
So, in summary, I think there was nothing wrong with the GEX engine, but
rather the too-lean mixture it was asked to breathe.
