&gt; Volks,

&gt; Back in June, while I was driving across the US, I had a rear wheel
&gt; bearing failure.  In LA I went out to Pick Your Part (I LOVE CA
&gt; junkyards!!!) and pulled a rear bearing carrier and stub axle assembly.  I
&gt; installed this and was on my way.  Yesterday, I tore the dead one down and
&gt; have a couple of questions.
&gt;
&gt; 1. I am 99% sure the stub axle and hub are toast.  Although, there is no
&gt; obvious damage, it went a good many miles (probably 500-1000) with the
&gt; axle nut loose and the inner race of the bearing fractured. I have
&gt; sensible play between the hub and splines on the stub.  Dead, yes?

If by &quot;sensible&quot; you mean &quot;you can just barely feel it&quot; then it's probably
OK.  If you can see denting on the splines or in the hub it probably
isn't.

&gt;
&gt; 2. When I drove out the outer bearing, I discovered that there is no lip
&gt; on the inner end of the housing!!!  All my experience in driving bearings
&gt; in is to press 'til it hits a lip.  The Bentley's says nothing of this,
&gt; just &quot;drive in the new bearing&quot;.  The old bearing was flush with the
&gt; housing at its outer edge, so I guess that is how deep I will drive the
&gt; new one, but how wierd!!!

The spacing between bearings is, IIRC determined by the spacer between the
inner and outer bearings.  It takes all that stress when you torque down
the nut.  If the bearings couldn't float a bit, you would stress the
bearings.

&gt; 3.  Any tips on getting the big circlip out from the inner bearing?  I
&gt; don't own a circlip pliers that big and I am pretty sure I don't want to.
&gt; Looks like a Snap-on $200 tool :-)

Big snap ring tool.  No substitute for proper tools.  You don't have to
pay Snap-on prices, but get the right one!
