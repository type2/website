Subject: Re: custom westy cabinet handles

Message bounced so I'm posting to the list:

Andrew: you need to tell us what the anticipated cost would be for such an
item. Without that information, it would be hard to decide.

Sami 

&gt; i'm in the middle of a resto/custom restoration on a 71 ex sunroof/soon to be
&gt; sunroof-westy. and i've been toying with the idea of casting and producing a
&gt; hand full of solid aluminum westy cabinet handles, which could then be brushed
&gt; or polished. they would be like exactly like the original, push button grey or
&gt; black plastic ones, but they would be metal instead.
&gt; 
&gt; so i was just wondering if anyone would be interested in getting a set for
&gt; themselves. if so drop me a pmail.
