Message-Id: &lt;199905301230.FAA08834_at_helix.ucsd_dot_edu&gt;

I am getting paranoid about installing new parts in my bus. 

Example #1: I decided to do something about the ratty positive battery 
cable. So I bought an &quot;Exide&quot; brand cable with two leads attached to the 
ternminal clamp; I spliced the alternator cable into one and the other 
smaller wire (can't remember where it goes) into the other. The lead 
separated from the terminal clamp -- it just fell out. That burned out 
the diodes in the alternator, and led to the failure on my trip to Tucson.

Example#2: Dipstick bellows. Less than 1000 miles to failure. Enough said.

Example #3: Gas guage sender. I replaced the old one with a shiny new 
sender when I rebuilt my engine. It doesn't work! I tested it before 
installing it, but only at the top of its motion (reading full). It 
seemed to work then. But this is the only time it works. When I fill the 
tank the needle does a little dance, goes up to the 1/1 position, then 
drops to less than 1/4 and drops off after a few miles.  Yesterday, just 
to make sure, I took off the firewall, managed to squeeze my hand through 
that small space between the rear deck and the tank, switched the wires 
to ground the guage wire, and checked the result. A rock steady 1/1. So 
my VW-specific FLAPS sold me a bad sender. I hope they are getting a good 
giggle out of it -- the thought of some schmuck having to pull out his 
gas tank not once but twice for one repair.

In all three cases, the parts that failed were purchased at FLAPS. Maybe
that's the key. I have had no problems with parts ordered from Ron or from
Jim Thompson. (Remember Jim Thompson? He's the guy who used to stay put
and talk your ear off on the phone. Now he's running around the country
contemplating his navel or some such.) And so far I have had zero problems
with used parts that I've pulled out of junked buses. But now when I think
about replacing my brake hoses with new hoses, it makes me paranoid. 

This is just a rant.
