Subject: Re: [T2] new brake pads won't go in

It would help if you gave the year of your bus.....

I am assuming you have a 71 or 72?

Sounds like they gave you 73-79 pads which are thicker. Screw-ups like this
happen, but usually the other way around. They put thin 71/72 pads in 73+
parts boxes.
Take them back and get the correct pads.



&gt; Newbie and not ashamed to admit it or ask for help, thanks in advance.
&gt;
&gt; What are some tricks to getting new pads in?  There seems no way except to
&gt; maybe pound them in.  Bentley shows a tool to moving the brake pistons(?)
&gt; all the way back, and mine are barely sticking out but can't get them all
&gt; the way in.
&gt;
&gt; Maybe the pads I got are not correct and are too thick?  Do I file down the
&gt; pads?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Daniel
