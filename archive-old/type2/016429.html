&gt; Hello:
&gt; (snip)
&gt; &gt; D'oh! mine's where the dipstick was. And, btw, it's kinda loose in there,
&gt; &gt; I'd like to figure out a way to hold it better, the thing about using a
&gt; &gt; little piece of fuel line, didn't make a lot of sense to me...
&gt;
&gt; There is a small rubber tube between the hole in the case where the
&gt; dipstick (or temp sender) goes and the tube in the tin that you see from
&gt; above that you insert the dipstick into.  I guess Doc Williams [&quot;Robert
&gt; S.Williams, MD-laptop&quot; &lt;rwill_at_digitechs_dot_com] simply used a piece of fuel
&gt; line to replace the original part, which is designed (with an expanded
&gt; middle part) to be more flexible in case the two parts don't exactly line
&gt; up. It seems to have worked for him.
&gt;

        I think you guys are talking apples and oranges here -- Dr. Williams
has a  later Type 4 engine, with the real long curved dipstick going in the
top of the crankcase -- and there aren't any dipstick temp senders that fit
those engines AFAIK. You are trying to apply what he did to fix his oil leak
to your Type 1 or very early type 4 straight, short dipstick, I believe.
