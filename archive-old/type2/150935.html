Subject: distributor numbers/info

      I came accross some old dizzy's in a a pile of stuff I got for free.  
I've already posted them to thesamba to sell.  I'm not sure what some of 
them are though.  I'm not even sure if I have them in the right section or 
for a reasonable price.  I tried looking them up, and found some info at 
Wolfsburg West and Old Volks Home for some of them, but at least one of them 
I can't find anywhere.

Dizzy: VJ4BR15

I found a listing on Old Volks that states that dizzy VJR4BR18 (which I also 
have one of) is a late Porsche 356 distributor.  So I am guessing maybe the 
BR15 is an early Porsche 356 Distributor???  I put it in the early beetle 
parts section.

Is there some kind of master-list from Bosch on Dizzy Number vs. 
application?  I can send pics if anyone is interested/curios.

Bus content: Somebody at the last bug-out in Manassas told me this was a 
very early bus distributor, though I don't actually think it is.


Thanks!
