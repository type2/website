Subject: Re: [T2] Keeping a bus from being stolen

*Geez, Louise! Those guys just went for it!!! Not much you can do to stop
that! I just heard about Mexican thieves that are running the border
crossing and they have specially fortified front ends to push other
vehicles
out of the way, and tires filled with silicone so that tire nail strips
cannot deflate them. They just keep on going, and going, and going.. Jan

A recent alien transportation scenario had 40 illegals in a 50 foot
trailer, 2 people were dead from stabbing, 6 are in the hospital from
heat, 24 ran off and the rest are all staying with some nice guy in a
single family residence. There are others that cannot be accounted for.
I'm not naive! Things aren't getting better in Mexico, their jobs are
going to China just like ours are.
Off my soapbox!
No more of this.
