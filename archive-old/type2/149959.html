Subject: Re: [T2] valve springs on hydraulic lifters

&gt; My question is on the springs in the heads that close the valves.
&gt; 
&gt; With hydraulic lifters, I believe that the exhaust valves need a special,
&gt; stronger spring than with the solid lifters.  Do the intake valves ALSO need
&gt; the same, stronger spring or can I use the solid lifters springs??

I believe all 8 springs are heavier. Not sure how you will get those
springs, unless they are good used. The dealer might still have them
available, but they are not available in the aftermarket at all.

&gt; There must be some way to measure the strength of the springs.  Any ideas
&gt; out there??

Valve spring tester. Not to cast any aspersions on your engine builder, but
this is a pretty standard tool for a builder to have in the shop.

Do a google search for &quot;valve spring tester&quot; and you will see what I am
speaking about.
