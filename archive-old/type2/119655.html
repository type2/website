Subject: hard turning door locks

My 78 Westy has front door locks that are VERY difficult to turn with the
key.  The will open but I am afraid a key will break.   I usually open the
sliding door, pull open the lock on the passenger side, and enter that way.
Does anyone have suggestions on what could be done externally to make these
locks work smoother?   If I have to remove the inside door panels to get at
the linkage, what is the best proceedure and do I need any special tools.
All other locks open easily.

David in Washington DC
