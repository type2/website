Subject: Re: VW Bus typeface/font

i found it somewhere a while back. Downloaded it and it didnt work. Other
ppl told me the same thing. The search continues....


&gt;Does anyone know where that font that looks like the emblem from the back
of
&gt;the bus (with the underline joining all the characters) can be found?
