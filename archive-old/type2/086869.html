Subject: Re: [T2] Inquiry on my rebuilt engine

Torry,

If you can get get good 0-60mph times, there are some out there on the
net.
  Some take 1/4 mile times and weight of vehicle and try to calculate from
that.

try these http://www-sci.lib.uci_dot_edu/HSG/RefCalculators1.html#AUTO-I-E

Cheers, dave
