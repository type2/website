Subject: Re: [T2] Did Westfalia do Hightops?

Does anyone have pics of these? I have seen the Helsinki and Berlin Westies,
but no hightop Westy, at least not a Baywindow. I have seen the big metal
split thing, but I am pretty sure we are talking about a fiberglass top in
this discussion.


Was stated: &quot;At least not for the U.S. market. They have sold high top VW
campers in Europe&quot;.
