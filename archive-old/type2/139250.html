I have an ACN SVDA in my '76 with stock FI.  The original distributor 
on my engine was the dual-vacuum (advance + retard) type.  VW later 
went to a single-vacuum on this engine.

My original distributor was in sad shape, and will be rebuilt to use as 
a spare one of these days.  But I love my SVDA + Pertronix.  Bus runs 
great.  I'm currently getting only about 15-16mpg, but I tend to 
measure it after 70mph freway driving, and my in-down driving is hilly. 
  I'm going to be installing a CDI in an attempt to improve my mileage 
(all parts are finally here... now to pull the firewall to install the 
terminal blocks to handle the wiring!)

I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the SVDA.  It's a genuine Bosch part 
that was stock for at least one VW engine (I seem to recall it matches 
the stock '74 Type 1 engine distributor), and it seems to have an 
advance curve that suits the Type 4 engine well.
