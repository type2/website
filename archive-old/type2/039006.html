Subject: Pulling the gas tank???

  Hello everyone.  I've been reading this list for
about a month now as I've been searching for a vw
camper and you have all provided me with a wealth of
knowledge.  This is my first post.  I just became the
proud owner of a 76 westy that's going to need a
little tlc to get roadworthy again.  Someone snagged
the gas cap and it's been sitting with the tank
exposed for about a year and a half.  How do I go
about pulling the tank to have it cleaned.  Do I need
to pull the engine?  Also this thing hasn't been
started in about two years.  Are there any seals or
anything I should change in the engine before I try to
start this thing up?  Other than oil change and
general tune up stuff.  Any help would greatly be
appreciated.  =)  Thanks in advance.

                   Shawn
