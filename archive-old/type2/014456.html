we stopped by and looked at 1970 westy the other day. looked pretty
clean. found out it's been stored in a garage last 2 years, when we
talked to the owner today. new tires,new brakes. says wiper motor
doesn't work . he doesn't know whats on motor rebuild as done by PO but
says has power loss and gas in oil. he is not mechanically inclined. he
is living in san francisco but will be here this weekend. we are going
to take a better look at it then and drive it. he needs to sell and
wants 1200.00 for it. you can call him at (415)587-9606 ask for billy or
you can wait and see what we post this weekend.
it does have air conditioning but he does not know if it works.
