Subject: Westies in the Woods vs Manassas
Message-Id: &lt;199905231614.MAA09432_at_mime3.prodigy_dot_com&gt;

Asked D. Gibbons: &gt;&gt;Besides the Manassates (sp?) bug out does any one know
of activities say around Wash DC for camping events?  &lt;&lt;

Westies in the Woods is a nice family event, located in North Jersey's
Stokes State forest.  I think it's a Limbo sponsored event.  No hookups,
but it's a big field all to ourselves.  Bit of a drive from DC, but no
moreso  that all the times I drove to Manassas from here.  I've given up
the traffic, racetrack noise, and crowds of Manassas Bugout for the later
Litchfield, Ct. event, which frankly had more busses on show last year than
Manassas ever did.....MB
