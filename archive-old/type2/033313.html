&gt; 185 x .78 = 144.3
&gt; 195 x .75 = 146.25

Problem with this is that the aspect ratio of the 185R14 is 0.82, not
0.78

185 x .82 = 151.7
 
&gt; this is your sidewall height.  True, this DOES vary from manufacture
&gt; and
&gt; model....but.

Yes, the 185 or 195 is the &quot;nominal&quot; dimension, which only has to fit
into a range of dimensions, the exact extent of which I have been
unable to find.  There is an industry standard somewhere, but I can't
find it on the web.  Tire dealers don't seem to have it either.

&gt; I can attest to the fact that the Y370 195/75 is definitly more
&gt; massive
&gt; (even when worn out) then my 195/75 Bridgestone 603s...  Taller
&gt; (slightly!) and wider. (as wide as the oooold E78 or something like

Do 603s come in 195/75?  I didn't know that!

I measured Uniroyal 195/75R14s and found them to be 1/2 inch smaller in
diameter than the 185R14 Bridgestones.  The tread was about a half-inch
wider, but the sidewall width was actually a bit narrower than the
185s.  These tires have been relegated to winter snow chain duty, since
they have such nice wheelwell clearance.

The difference in running is probably small, but I'd just as soon see
people get the correct size, so that the correct size will continue to
be produced.  Folks in Europe might have better supply, since it is
used on several makes of minivan there, but the last vehicle using this
size and imported to the US was a '95 Nissan.
