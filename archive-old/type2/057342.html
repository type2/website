Subject: Need good used 091 tranny

My trusty mechanic informs me that the tranny in my 1982 Aircooled Vanagon
Westi is &quot;fixin to die&quot; and suggests that I lay hands on a good used tranny
for when the inevitable finally occours. Anyone out there have a line on a
good used 091 tranny? I'm planning a trip from southern Arkansas out west
to Southern California so would prefer to find one along the route
somewhere. 

As an additional note, I did find a good used 002 tranny here in a local
junkyard in a late bus that has been sitting for about 10 years. I guess
this one will not work in my vehicle. let me know if anyone wants it and
I'll give you the phone # of the junkyard. It's in El Dorado, Arkansas. 

thanks for any help you can provide.
