Ok, everyone.  Thanks for the help.  I think I am going to lay it down
for the night.  Plans for tomorrow are to take the throttle body off and
clean it and check to see if the seal between the throttle body and air
intake manifold is good or bad.  If it is bad, then I will be ordering
some parts.  By the way, what is the name of that seal anyways?  Would
not know what to ask for when ordering it.  Also, anything that I should
be keeping an eye out for when removing the throttle body.  Am I going
in the right direction?  Thanks again for everyones help.  Was hoping I
could find some more stuff in the archiveso I wouldn't have to post so
much, but didn't have much luck.  Did notice that a lot of stuff in
there is misspelled.  Maybe that's the key to getting the searches to
work. Cross your fingers, hopefully tomorrow will turn out better.
