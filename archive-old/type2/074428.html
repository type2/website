Subject: Re: [T2] Engine-neering - combustion chamber question

Chris,

Someone intthe hotrod biz out there sells some stuff made specifically for
that sort of thing...one of the guys on the vintagvw list had used it
several years ago and was pleased....spray and bake.

Unfortunately, I seem to have lost the e-mail and pictures describing the
process.


Good for heads and piton tops.   Supposedly what the top fuel funny car
folks use.....in other words, &quot;not cheap&quot;


Cheers ,dave

&gt; 
&gt; Naturally it's raising some questions. I want get a bit of your expertise.
&gt; 
&gt; I was reading about combustion chambers and the author was saying that 
&gt; polished surfaces reflect heat (I knew that) and that keeping heat from 
&gt; soaking into the heads (combustion chamber) is a good thing, I think he was 
&gt; saying it would make more HP this way.
&gt; 
&gt; So... is he saying that a polished combustion chamber and exhaust port 
&gt; would be advantageous and make more HP? Would a coating on the piston help 
&gt; this effect?
&gt; 
&gt; So how polished is good and how much is too much? If you could achieve a 
&gt; polished effect like found on wheels would that be the best you could 
&gt; theoretically hope for? Would it last more than 10 seconds after the first 
&gt; time you started the engine (carbon and basic soot would ruin any polished 
&gt; effect right?)?
&gt; 
&gt; Finally I know there are different kinds of ceramic coatings that can be 
&gt; applied that would do about the same thing. Has anyone tried this, what 
&gt; sort of cost, durability? Does it ruin the engine's ability to heat the 
&gt; interior of passenger compartment? How good is the horsepower increase? 10 HP?
&gt; 
&gt; I suppose that coating the combustion chamber and the pipes inside and out 
&gt; would be good right? Does it help the engine's fuel efficiency?
&gt; 
&gt; Just doing more armchair engineering...  Cheaper that way.
&gt; 
&gt; Love those Tatra engines - amazing engineering!
