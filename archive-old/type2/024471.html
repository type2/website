Gentlepersons-
                       ...The ethanol thread ran on another list I subscribe 
to, but related more to racing than day to day driving. The racers using 
ethanol (along with other mods to their engines), related the need to run 
straight gas through the system after
racing to prevent melting down some parts of the fuel system from continuous 
con-
tact with the ethanol...Careful with that solvent, Eugene.
