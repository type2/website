Subject: RE: [T2] 72 Camper Question

Look at the sticker on the drivers (or passenger's) door jamb. It will say
which year it is. My bet is the owner either doesn't know the difference
between a Type 1 and a Type4 or it is really a '71 model or a very early '72
that is really a '71. I have seen the latter with a bunch of '71 models that
were really '70 models without disc brakes (but with the booster plate). 

In my experience, many, many buses have been mis-registered as a later year.
These were buses that dealers had extra inventory that carried over and they
wanted the full price of a new model. OR registered by folks who lost their
title(s), moved to another state and &quot;guessed&quot; at the year. Most DMVs didn't
have cross referenced VIN archives until the computer age came along, so
mistakes were made.

It is pretty rare to find an import with a 1600, but you never know...

I looked at a non-running 72 camper today that had a 1600cc motor. I thought
they came standard with a 1700cc. The owner said the motor was original.
I'm interested in buying the bus, but not if I'm going to have to replace
the
engine.
Is he correct or am I?
