Subject: Re: [T2] Water Tank Woes

Hey John,
First question, does your water pump have a barbed nipple on the same 
side as the threads that fit into the tank?  In other words, can the 
input side of the pump take a hose or screw into something?  The pump 
that I have in my bus has a barb on it so instead of putting the pump 
directly into the tank, I have a threaded barb that goes into the tank 
and then there's a hose that connects the barb to the pump which is 
mounted on the side of the cabinet.  The advantage of this is that you 
don't have all the weight of the pump swinging around.

However, this obviously won't help you if you don't have that type of 
pump.  Anyways, just put a hose clamp around the plastic outlet on the 
tank, put some new teflon tape around the pump/barb (wrapped in the 
correct direction so it doesn't come undone as you crew it in), screw it 
in, then tighten the hose clamp.  I did that on mine and it's leak free.

Hope that helps.
Mike

&gt; Anyone have any experience with a striped water tank outlets?
&gt;
&gt; I found my leak - the outlet where the pump screws in is stripped.  
&gt; The PO had some sort of blue stuff around the pump where it goes into 
&gt; the outlet - I suspect it was gasket stuff but ... I dunno.
&gt;
&gt; I got a new pump and wrapped loads of Teflon tape around it and put it 
&gt; in but it doesn't seem to get very tight - it appears pretty much 
&gt; stripped. I'm wondering if it is possible to tap it and put some sort 
&gt; of bushing in there and then put the pump in - anyone ever try this?  
&gt; Is it possible to pull the tank with the cabinet still installed?
