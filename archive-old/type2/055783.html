Red, says gasoline on it, so I toss it in the tank. Wooo woo and off we
go.

Yup- I've had a problem similar, which makes me caustious about what is in the
gas tank.   Old gas.    I got a 70 westy from my dad's neighbor that had sat
for enough years to turn the gas in the tank to something other than gas.  It
caused all sorts of problems, including stranding me with a stuck valve
outside Redding.    Mea Culpa.    And I felt dumb- why didn't I think to drain
the tank?   Well, that's when I learned.   So I ended up pulling the motor and
tearing it down to get the heads off, waiting for the rescue team to arrive
with a rebuildt set of heads.
