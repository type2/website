Quoth John, on 16 Jan 01, at 16:32:

&gt; That distributor will NOT work properly on the 30 PICT series of carbs; the
&gt; vacuum requirement of the distributor is different than what the carb gives
&gt; it.

Thanks for the info, John - does that mean the carb (?fitting? 
?manifold vacuum?) doesn't supply enough vacuum - and therefore 
not enough advance?

Would that mean no vac advance or just less of it?  If the latter, it's 
still better than what I have (none) and given that it's little work and 
I have the part, seems worth trying -- UNLESS you or someone 
else suggests potential damage.

Jest wond'rin,
Joe
