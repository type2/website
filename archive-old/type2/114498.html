Subject: Heat-retention curtain...

Volksies:

I know that someone makes a heat-retentive curtain, with plastic window
for rear-view mirror, that goes up with Velcro just behind the front
seats in a '70's Westie camper, but I have lost the URL and can't
remember the name of the company.  Can anyone please sent me the info?

Thanks,

Don Kaag
(...and Brunhilda, the '73 Westie Wonderbus...)
