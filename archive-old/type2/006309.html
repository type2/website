Subject: ARRRRGGHHHH! Shock replacement!!!!
Date: Wed, 11 Oct 2000 12:15:02 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I have two KYB GR2 gas shocks to put on my 70 bug, but when I took the old
ones off, the bottom steel spacer/bushing stayed on the bottom torsion arm
on the shock mounting! I thought &quot;no problemo, I'll just drive the
spacer/bushing out of the new KYB shock and put it on with the old bushing
still stuck there, but no way can I drive it out! Suggestions? I don't have
access to heat to try to free up the old bushing, but I have a
dremel/grinder, can I carefully cut this old bushing away? Is there
something I'm missing re: driving out the new bushing on the KYB shock? It
is NOT moving either!
HELP!
Thanks,
Courtney
