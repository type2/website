Subject: Disconnecting the air bag on a Saturn (non-VW)

&gt;A friend (4'10&quot;, female) asked me tonight whether I 
&gt;could do her the favor of disconnecting the air bag on 
&gt;her new Saturn. She is quite concerned about some 
&gt;stories she has heard about deaths caused by short 
&gt;people being too close as the air bag inflates and being 
&gt;killed by the inflating bag.                           H Steven Dolan

Sorry, I haven't a clue regarding the wiring of these 
things, but air bags can and do save the lives of 
normal-sized folk. Instead of disconnecting the air bag, 
she might consider installing a switch (bag on/bag off) 
to toggle, depending on who is riding shotgun.  And, at 
4'10&quot;, I don't think she needs to worry; the danger seems 
to be for kids under 10 and midgets/dwarves.
