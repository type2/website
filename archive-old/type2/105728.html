Subject: Re: [T2] [Friday] Make your own bus!

From: &quot;daniel nelson&quot; &lt;danielbnelson_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;
&gt; THIS IS SOOOOOOOOOO COOL!!!!!
&gt; I'm gonnna print it out and make it with my 3 year old son tonight.
However,
&gt; I'm gonna print it black and white so it's not that awful snot green
color.
&gt; Hahahaha, here come the flames from all the owners of green buses.

Okay, I KNOW that this one didn't make it into my mailbox today.  In the
last week, I've missed a few messages from the list, some of my own and a
few replies to the same messages.

Would someone please repost the link to this craft project?  Thanks!
