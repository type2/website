Subject: Re: Basic Body repair- headlight replacement

Yo Steve- When you don't have pulling abilities or come-alongs, you can
do what I did (with a Karman Ghia in my Syracuse University days),
rotted to the point of having no place to hold its bucket)- Hacksaw the
headlight bucket out of a junkyard bus, and bolt/rivet it to the front
of your damaged skin at the right angle!  Ugly but functional; legal in
New York where I was, probably NOT Pennsylvania, not sure of elsewhere! 
That Ghia (62) has fond memories- the spare tire was kept from falling
thru to the ground by rope that we strung back and forth between front
axle and the front bumper!  Had to push start it a lot (easy) and got 40
mi to the gallon!
