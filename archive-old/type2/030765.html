Subject: Rear Bearings--Help!
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.GSO.4.03.9907170125400.29567-100000_at_flagstaff.Princeton.EDU&gt;

I have most everything dialed in on my '70 Westy. One of the last things
before I head for the west coast is overhauling the rear brakes.  

It was time for new shoes anyway but since I replaced the hoses and
cylinders in the front--I figured why not the rear too.  so the 
new cylinders are in and shoes on--I put the right side drum on and
hmm--theres not enough threads on the axle! so I feel behind it and sure
'nuff--THE CV joint/stub axle assembly is MOVING IN AND OUT! So holding it
&gt;from the back I put the drum  back on and gently screw the axle nut finger
tight--

QUESTION:  can I forget this happened, or is there something seriously
wrong with my rear bearing? is this looseness normal?

Thanks,

Will
