Subject: Gen light is back and I am now stumped. 

71 Transporter.

When I bought it, the generator light was on. (Not suprising - it had been
sitting for a while.)
So, I had the generator bench tested (it was ok), and replaced the brushes.
(The gen. light was still on.) I then replaced the voltage regulator. (The
gen light went out.) I then went on to do some other chores on the engine:
replaced the starter, changed the plugs, removed the electric fuel pump and
put a new stock one on, and replaced the coil. Today, while driving the bus,
the gen light came back on. I am now stumped. Any tips or things to check
would be much appreciated!

Thanks in advance...

- Austin
