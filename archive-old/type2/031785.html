&gt; Hello all...I am in the process of restoring a 1974 bus that I got when my 
&gt; brother died.  I used to drive it all the time until it needed work.  Now I 
&gt; am in the process of fixing everything that is wrong with it...the problem 
&gt; is...I'm eager to drive it...chipped paint and all...My question is...would 
&gt; it be out of line to drive it or should I wait until I have it fixed 100% to 
&gt; drive it?

drive it if it pleases you.

. the restore it faithfully
. the drive it til the rust wins
. most of the rest of us in a constant battle to keep em on the road
