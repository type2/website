Subject: Brake warning light

The brake warning light has been on constantly since I got the van running
last month. The hand brake was hardly working so I set out to adjust the
rear brakes. This ran me into frozen adjusting stars. It is obvious that the
PO had problems - the access holes were elongated from trying to adjust the
stuck stars. I pulled off the drums and backed of the good adjuster on each
side and then was able to pull all the stars. After soaking in solvent and
spraying with WD I was able to open all stars and have them move smoothly!!
Upon re-assembly and adjustment, I no longer have constant light at the
warning light but none at all??? It does not come on when the ignition is
turned on, but is also not shining at all times. There has never been a
switch at the hand brake - but there is a wire from the warning light that
is not attached and a ground wire where the switch should be. Any thoughts?
TIA
