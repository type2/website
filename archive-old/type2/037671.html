&gt; obviously the tabs go down, 

No they DEFINITELY go UP.

&gt;  but which side

&gt;  drivers side, or passenger side?

(right or left hand drive?) - the LONG tab is on the right

&gt;  it looks like it has something to do with
&gt;  getting into reverse, perhaps to separate
&gt;  seccond from reverse.

Yes, pressing down on the stick allows the disk shaped guide on the shaft to 
pass under the plate and the 'kick up' at the front of the tab allows the top 
of the stick to go back into the reverse position.
Remember that as the guide plate is below the sticks pivot point everything 
is the opposite of the movement at the top of the stick.

Good luck
