Subject: Curtain questions for a Westy

My wife and I are making some curtains for our '71 Westfalia, and I had a couple of questions.  Hopefully, someone on the list can help.

1.  The curtain track above the slider appears to be different than the others.  The others are a simple rod that bolts to the wall, and the curtain slides over them.  On the slider, it appears to be a track arrangement.  Are there special track slides that you can get?  Do they attach easily to the curtain?

2.  For the front of the bus, I found an arched rod that appears to bolt to the ceiling, with each end fastened by the seat belt holders, but it also appears to be a special track.  Are there special track slides for this, too?

3.  It also appears that there are snaps by the front and rear corners of the door, for one large curtain to cover the windshield and door windows.  Is this the correct arrangement for a Westy?

4.  Any pointers on the curtain for the passenger side, rear quarter?  How difficult is it to pull out the closet, etc. back there to get into the window?

I'd like to get my bus as close as possible to the original factory configuration, so any help is appreciated.  If there are references out there that I can check, please let me know.

Please respond directly as I am in digest mode.

Thank you for all your help.  This list is a great resource.

- Glen
