&gt; What does a normal FI fuel pump sound like? I ran mine with the engine off,

they should be quiet. not very loud as well, my limited experience
with them has also shown that if the suction side of the pump is
blocked (i.e. filter clogged or clogged tank) the pump will become
much louder as well. I'd check for a restriction first, but plan on
replacing that pump sometime soon.
