PADME(71' Westy) does that too(the GEN light thing) all except the light at
high rpms. After reading the segment in the Muir manual I came to the
conclusion that the since the idle speed is supposed to be set to run just
fast enough to keep the light on then it would make sense to me that when
there is extra draw on the electrical system then the light would light up
temporarily. I have progressed from this point with the thought that if the
light doesn't stay on or get bright enough to really be &quot;LIT&quot; up then I keep
on going and it has always gone out(out in the sense that the dim light
coming from it stops when I begin to move(or slightly rev the engine). But
if it stays on I would definately be more worried. If anyone else has any
info on this please let us know as I would hate to be causing damage to her
charging/electrical system based upon my ignorance.
Until next time,
Scott Beaupied

&gt; hi all - changing the fuel pump helped me get the 75 rolling, but also
made
&gt; me realize i can not be confident taking it beyond town quite yet. two
&gt; things, possibly related, which i'd like to discuss here with you. i
notice
&gt; the ALT LIGHT comes on when 1) the headlights are on and my foot is on the
&gt; brake pedal - stop signs, red lights; 2) if headlights are on, inbetween
&gt; ticks of the turn blinkers; and 3) at higher revs in higher gears. its not
&gt; limited to this, in that that's all the data i caught on a 10 mile/10pm
run
&gt; around the town. in addition coupled with this alternator light biz, i am
&gt; getting the dreaded hesitation like this: halfway through second gear it
&gt; feels like fuel starvation. same spot during third, and fourth gears as
&gt; well. new fuel filter with less than a 20 miles on it. the dwell is right
&gt; on 50, and otherwise it has great pickup and it runs very smoothly. this
75
&gt; was tuned less than a few hundred miles ago. do you see any related things
&gt; here? alt light and hesitatations? if no, don't let that keep from
&gt; expressing opinions. THANKS!!!  - steve
