Subject: RE: point gap

My understanding is that during the time the points are closed, the coil charges
up to (hopefully) its maximum (or DC) current flow, which is only limited by the
DC resistance of the coil and points (and any parasitics due to poor grounding
or dirty terminals) and the voltage applied to the positive terminal of the
coil.  During the time the points are open, the coil forces the spark, the
duration of which is determined by the charge on the coil and how long the
points are open.

So...you want the points closed long enough to fully charge the coil and open
long enough to fully discharge the coil.  As mentioned earlier, on four cylinder
engines it might not be a problem accomplishing both of these, so dwell may not
be as critical, except for how a change in dwell affects the timing.  When
reaching extremes however, it is conceivable that too small a gap will not allow
current flow to reach its maximum, thus reducing spark intensity and duration
and therefore, performance.  Being the non-expert, I don't know what the
allowance is except that I do know that the specification for dwell is (I think)
45-50 degrees.  Something in my attitude towards the design of VW's in general,
and the air-cooled engine in particular tells me that somewhere slightly above
50 degrees dwell the spark intensity starts decreasing due to insufficient
charge time, and somewhere slighty below 45 degrees, the coil isn't allowed to
get a maximal, useful discharge before charging starts again.  I do believe that
in the wisdom of the engine designers, there is a lot of conservative room built
into the specification to allow for variations in the techniques and intruments
used, so how far out of tolerance you can go before affecting performance is
totally unknown to me, which is why I used to check my points nearly every
month, and why I finally put the Pertronix electronic points in, so I never
again have to check the points.
