I have to put my .02 in here. I have bought parts from Ron since he first
opened. His dedication to supplying quality parts at low cost should be
applauded. I too have had problems with his service. I have also had
problems with my mechanic, my body shop, most of the other suppliers I have
dealt with all dealing with TIME. This wasn't done on time- that didn't come
on time,etc. It all goes with driving a vehicle that is old.

Where would we be without people like Ron and the other suppliers? Left at
the mercy of VOA for parts. None of us would be running if that were the
case.

We have given enough &quot;feed-back&quot; to Ron. I believe that if all of Ron's
&quot;problem&quot; orders were expressed as a percentage of all the orders he fills
on time and properly, that percentage would be very small.

Just my .02 worth. TBear
