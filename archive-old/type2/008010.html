Subject: Blower update and variable speed switch.

&gt;Thanks for the technical tip and detailed directions!  I pulled my
&gt;engine for the first time yesterday.  Everything has gone smoothly.
&gt;It's off to the local mechanic for a top end rebuild.  I think I'll add
&gt;a bilge blower now while the engine is out and before I head to
&gt;Colorado.  Thanks again!  BTW, where is a good place to find an Attwood
&gt;blower???

Well I have some more info on the blower install. I would go to a local 
baot supply house to get the blower, or if there is not ine near you try 
this place http://www.boatus_dot_com  or any other online boating supplier. 
I've seen then range in price from $19.99 to $26.00.
  After installing the blower and listening to it roar I decided to 
install a different switch. I pulled a headlight switch from a late 70's 
Dodge Aspen. I hooked the blower to the dash light resistor. This allows 
you to vary the speed of the blower from very slow to full blast. This 
is the best thing I could of done. Now the blower can be set to the 
desired out put instead of on or off. It also helps with the noise. I 
found that about 3/4 speed is just right, quiet and good output.
  The installation of the switch is simple, just hook the wires up to 
the dash light connections on the Dodge switch. The Dodges had about 15 
lights connected to this so it is a heavy duty setup, Don't use a VW 
switch, they only have about 4 lights connected and so the switch is 
lighter duty and not capable of the 2.6 amp load of the blower. The 
switch installs in the dash just like the VW switch that I described in 
the last post. I highly recomend this to you if you put a blower in or 
to make your current blower more pleasent to work with.
  If this is unclear feel free to drop me a line and I will try to make 
it clearer to you, it is well worth the time to upgrade.
