Subject: Re: patching Pop-top bug screen-use urethane!

Don't remove the canvas unless you plan to replace it anyway.  One
wonder for patching screening or mouse chew holes in the tent is to use
urethane bond, a clear liquid out of a tube (got it at a boat shop) that
dries tougher and more flexible than any silicone I've seen.  You can
bridge small holes directly; for larger rips I'd use a fiberglass or
nylon screening piece cut to bridge over the rip by 1/2&quot; at least- glob
the &quot;glue&quot; onto both the patch and the area it will sit on and place
together.  Let really dry, and when done, you won't believe the grip. 
I just removed my old canvas which had patches cut from flag nylon glued
on this way, and you couldn't pull the patch off- but areas I had used
silicone calk peeled readily!  Urethane stays a transparent color;
silicone kinda clouds.
