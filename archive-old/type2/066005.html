Hey Tom--

Cool.  A pilot buddy of mine is on his way in from the FBO at PDX [for 
novices, I had to learn this too: it's the private plane truckstop at 
Portland International] in a matter of moments.  Even as we speak.  
Thanks for bringing this info back to the surface.

&gt; The only trouble is explaining it to passengers. Most folks don't want
&gt; to hear that you're worried that your car is poisoning anyone who rides
&gt; in it.

Okay, I won't tell them.  I'll say it's for gamma rays from the
decommissioned nuclear reactors/weapons plants all over this neck of the
woods.  That should ease their minds.  Or perhaps it comes in the shape 
of a pine tree, and I can hang it from the rear view mirror?  Who'd 
suspect that?

Seriously, no one rides in my bus who doesn't have some sense of the Big 
Bus Picture, so there's probably no explaining to do.

Thanks again.
