&gt; yet. And, interestingly, most VW bus drivers I see are NOT engaged in any
of
&gt; those activities.
Probably because between wind gust and shifting you don't really have the
extra arm to grab a drink.  My bus has some free play in the steering so
that kind of cuts in to reaction time but I have sat drinks on the dash only
to have them in your lap (once) when you finally do get into 1st gear!!
