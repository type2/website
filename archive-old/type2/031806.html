&gt; Thanks for all the advice so far... I have expectations of the worst but 
&gt; will keep my fingers crossed till it's confirmed (and will post back to the 
&gt; list when I know).  Guess it serves me right for getting seduced by this 
&gt; relatively rust-free beauty (which also happened to be relatively 
&gt; history-less).   In the meantime, anyone know of a good re-builder in New 
&gt; England (SE COnnecticut or thereabouts) since this repair may be beyond my 
&gt; abilities (though my finances may force me to learn fast)??

Bruce Wilson is one of the better Type 4 engine rebuilders I know. he is
outside of Boston...he says he wants to retire from engine work but if you
can convince him you won't be disappointed
