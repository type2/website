Subject: Front disc problems

Hi again

I wrote about a week ago that I have braking problems with my front brakes.

Now I have dismantled the master cylinder(again!!) and checked that the 
linings are right and that no holes is blocked.

But I noticed a strange thing with my servo becose when I brake without my 
master cylinder attached to the servo there comes a lot of fluid out of the 
servo. And when I pull the brake pedal up it bubbles from the servo.

Have my master cylinder been leeking and could that be the reason why my 
front brakes doesn´t work.

I know that the calibers and brakelines works fine so the problem is 
situated somewhere else.

Just to dubblecheck, can you tell me if my linings are in the right 
direction starting from the servo:
SERVO &lt; &lt; &lt; &gt; &lt; &lt;  (the first two are bigger)

Everything in my master cylinder looks good exept one thick plastic thing. 
What is the function for that.
It is almost at the top.

Hope you understood everything.
It would be nice if you could copy your reply to:
johansvanborg_at_bassplayer.cc

Please help me!
//Johan
