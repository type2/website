&gt; Now the pedal pulses a bit when I brake, less obvious if I stand on the

&gt; they can't warp lying on the garage floor! I didn't disturb the
&gt; hydraulics on the system so it is in theory the same as before.  Of
&gt; course all the discs etc have been off and put back on (including the
&gt; rear drums), but since the wheel bolts ensure all these components bed
&gt; up then it's not that they're loose.  I didn't even take the disc off
&gt; the hubs just undid the bearings and removed the lot.

did per chance did you get the wheelhubs back on the wrong side, so now
they would be spinning in the reverse direction????
