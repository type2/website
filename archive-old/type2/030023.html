&gt; Greetings, 
&gt; 
&gt; I've been thinking about adding a second battery to my 77 Westfalia for
&gt; auxiliary camping purposes.  I found a pretty good deep cycle battery that
&gt; will fit on the left side of the engine compartment, but before I proceed
&gt; I'm trying to determine the best way to hook it into my charging system.
&gt; 
&gt; Through some research there seems to be two major options, First being the
&gt; diode isolator method.  In this approach two diodes are used to connect both
&gt; batteries to the alternator / voltage regulator system, available at any
&gt; FLAPS...
&gt; The second option is to employ a separator,  this system is more
&gt; sophisticated in that it uses relays and a simple circuit that monitors the
&gt; charge of the batteries.  As one battery becomes charged it will switch
&gt; charging to the second battery.

The third option is what I did in my C*evy pickup for camping.  the second
battery has its own alternator!  (It helps that the engine had an air pump
bracket installed, but no air pump.  The alternator bolted on with one
fabbed bracket and a longer belt, and looks like it's factory installed.)

the cost of a rebuilt alternator was actually lower than the whizbang
isolator, and I get full reduncancy.

This would be tough with a VW, but it isn't impossible.  IIRC, VW actually
made dual-generator pedistals for military applications.

IMHO, the best setup is a simple isolation relay.  The KISS principle in
action.
