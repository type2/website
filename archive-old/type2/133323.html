&gt; DIN and SAE are so close that it doesn't really matter for anything less

&gt; I think the multiplier is something like 1.01

little more than that.

Bentley has as much as 10hp for some engines,
 eg engine code AE
     DIN   50HP
     SAE   60HP

    engine code GD

    DIN   70 HP
    SAE   67 HP

which makes no real sense is why DIN is higher in one and lower in the
other if there is a constant factor
