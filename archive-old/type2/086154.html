Subject: RE: [T2] 77 muffler

&gt;  I need a new muffler. What's an inexspensive route.
&gt; Can Midas or some outfit like that do it?


Possibly. But first you need to know what you're dealing with.

Does your present setup look like this?

If so, and only the muffler itself is bad, then you're looking at $75 for a
brand new European made replacement from us (to give you a basis of
comparison).

However, if your present system lacks all of the piping shown, then you
probably have an aftermarket extractor system on your bus now, not a stock
muffler. In that case, you'll need another extractor system (which we also
sell for $75 with listmember discount, our part number 352000).  I'm not
sure Midas would carry something like that.
