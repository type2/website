well,

I may have goofed, and if so i apologize for the bad info... but i'm
curious as to why it would be timed the same with or without retard hooked
up. (i remeber that the retard side should never be blocked off... the
single vac can has a hole in the back, so if one only uses advance of a
dual vac the hole needs to be open to the atmosphere)

&gt;From what i have read the retard section only kicks in at idle, and once
the throttle plate is opened that vacuum source is much less...

So, specifically speaking of the 71 bus distributor:

Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 2-5deg Adv, 11-13deg Ret; Centrifugal:
12-16deg _at_ 2200rpm, 22-25deg _at_ 3800rpm 

If the above numbers are correct... getting rid of the retard hose will 
cause the idle to need to be advanced approximately 11-13 degrees... as at
idle it retards the advance by that ammount... so lets say with no retard
one sets the distributor at 5 degrees BTDC.  Since the vacuum is capable
of pulling 5 degrees total advance and the centrigugal is capable of 25
degrees total advance, the 2 added together will be approximately 30
degrees of total advance.  If set to 7.5 total advance will be 32.5.

Now, i realize you are much more experienced than i am, and i am probably
wrong... but where is the error in my calculations?  I must have
overlooked something obvious im sure.

Terribly sorry to have wasted everyones time on this one.

thanks,

Stephen White
