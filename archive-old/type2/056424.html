&gt;Hey all:

&gt;What's a &quot;comfortable&quot; oil temp on an upright engine? The very new, low
&gt;compression, Berg engine in my bus will light up the oil temp dipstick if I
&gt;cruise the freeway at more than 3,400 rpm, which translates to about 60 I
&gt;think (speedometer is way the hell off). The oil temp dipstick is set to
&gt;make the light begin to flicker at 225F.

I think that's too low for the light to come on.  I'm of the belief that if
you run a good synthetic oil, 250 is no problem, although I wouldn't push
the bus real hard with the oil at this temperature.  If you got a gauge
that read out in degrees instead of binary, you would know a lot more.
