&gt; Trust us instead ;)

right now sounds good.

&gt; &gt; tested most of it and it checked out, haven't gotten to a few things that
&gt; &gt; really shouldn't matter (guages etc)   didn't have any wires, went to
&gt;
&gt; Ok, when I'm talking about the wiring harness, I'm referring
&gt; specifically to the ljet harness, not anything else.

oh, have a spare wiring harness but is probably in worse shape than the
existing one.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Something is strange about the fact that it runs 5 minutes and then
&gt; &gt;&gt; dies.  Did you check if you still had good spark after it died?  Did you
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; yes it still had decent spark
&gt;
&gt; at all plugs?

as best I can tell.

&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; try starter fluid after it died?  If, after it died and starter fluid
&gt; &gt;&gt; doesn't get it running again, I'd venture to guess the problem is an
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; starter fluid didn't get it started.
&gt;
&gt; This is the strange part.  If fluid didn't get it started, then that
&gt; means there's no spark, or poor spark.  Rationale here being that we
&gt; should be able to get the car to start without EFI just using starter
&gt; fluid, so that would lead me to believe that the problem is a spark issue.

me too, ???? very strange...

&gt; &gt; I'll bribe you to pay a visit to Baltimore??!?!?!?!
&gt;
&gt; haha.. I would.. but I'm in Cali.. a bit of a drive ;)

better get started  ;8*}}}


oh well, thanks anyway,' gotta try.
