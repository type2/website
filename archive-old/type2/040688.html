Subject: engine overhaul questions

Hi,
I am in the middle of a engine overhaul/clean up while my heads
are in the shop and my engine bearings came to mind.
Since I have never spilt the case and have no idea what
condition the bearings are in I wanted to know how long
the crank, cam, and connecting rod bearings usually last?
Miles/age if it matters?

Also is there a way to tell when a clutch pressure plate
needs replacing? Looks orginal to me

thanks for any replys in advance ;)
alex,
77' Rivera camper   ...79' 2L engine
