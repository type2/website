Subject: Trip

We are leaving on our yearly trek from Texas to Wisconsin this 
afternoon.  I readied the bus with a tune-up, carb adjust, oil change (new 
Mann filter, Mobil-1 15W50 synth), and also swapped out a torn CV boot 
(with another crappy new one that I know will only last a few months, but 
it's all I have right now).  Wave if you see our blue highroof '73 on 
I-30/55/57/43 this weekend!  Type2 sticker on the back and Wienerschnitzel 
wiener dog on the radio antenna.  We'll be driving slow and enjoying the 
scenery.

-David
