Subject: Re: buying and transporting questions 

Chris-

I encountered this when I bought a toyota truck in SLC, UT.  The DMV 
gives you, not a plate but one of those receipt type tags.  Although I 
only drove about 8 hours like this-- from SLC to Durango, CO, I did not 
encounter any probs.  Maybe call your &quot;home&quot; DMV and ask them?

Best, KE

&gt;&gt;
&gt; but what good is that going to do me on the rest of my 
&gt;&gt; trip back to MN?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;suggestions? anyone deal with this before?
