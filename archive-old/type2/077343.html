&gt; Why would that seem odd, everything I have learned about heads on my 2.0L

&gt; much greater problem ($$$).
&gt; 
&gt; Are there some of you out there who have gotten more than 60,000 miles out
&gt; of a set of 2.0L heads??? (without dropping a valve or seat)

all of mine have gone more than that.

the original set on my current 78 2L got to 214,000 before being replaced
(without dropping a valve), dropped a seat on a replacement but I lucked
out and it did no damage (my spare engine, unknown mileage, but lots it
was obvious)

the set I have now had Diesel seats put in and an interference put in to
physically keep em from coming out.
