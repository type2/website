Subject: Tranny questions

I posted this question a few days ago, but did not receive a conclusive
answer, so here we go again:

74 Bus with 2L engine. I am replacing the original 002 transmission
with a later (76 on) 091 transmission. I am planning to keep the old
flywheel with 215 mm clutch and the 74 bell housing and starter. Which
input shaft do I need to use - the shorter old 002 one or the later long
091 one? Or can I use either one?

I have a good 091 input shaft, but the 002 one is history. In case I
need to use the short 002 shaft, does anyone have one to spare? I am
looking for one with good surfaces where the pilot bearing and the seal
ride.

Does anyone know the part number for the oil return sleeve (directly
behind the seal in the transmission housing)?

Thanks,
Marcus
