Subject: RE: [T2] 78 bus rear torsion problems

Have you heard of a tool used to clamp the torsion arm and spring plate that
would effectively reduce the tension of the torsion bar?  This when the bus is
in the air on a hoist?  I think it's named a 'spring plate lift'? &gt; Perhaps
I'm not reading this correctly... There should&gt; not be any tension on the
torsion bar until you try to&gt; work it up onto the stop.&gt; &gt; Do you mean the
plate is vertically 3/8&quot; too high? or&gt; just too far out?&gt; &gt; You did seat the
inner splines (diiferent from the&gt; outer splines. You are using the same bars
you removed&gt; (a few different lengths are available)&gt; Last time I installed
new rubber donuts I had a tough&gt; time and had to improvise to get the caps on
far&gt; enough to use the stock bolts. I don't remember -&gt; sorry - what the
improvisation was. I think it&gt; involved longer bolts, but not in the classic
sense -&gt; Maybe a couple longer but smaller diameter bolts and&gt; nuts to pull it
in until the stockers reached, but I'm&gt; not sure. -BaH
