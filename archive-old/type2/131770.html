Subject: Re: [T2] Tank Rust after firewall pull.

Thanks, could I use the Naval Jelly instead of the Ospho and get the same 
results? I have it laying around here somewhere. I could go to Lowes there 
is one nearby if I can't. What happens to the black film that is bonded to 
the metal afterwards will it ever release and clog my lines? Or does it just 
stay there?

&gt;From: &quot;R. E. Haufler&quot; The iron phosphate will form a hard intact black 
&gt;colored film that stays
&gt;bonded to the iron, better than iron oxide, which flakes off.
