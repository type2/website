our 69 came with screen someone had rigged. a little sloppy, but very 
workable.  but we found a few days ago at a junkyard a perfect one from a 70. 
the guy just gave it to us. if you look around enough, you'll find a good 
one. i know a junkyard where there's two other bay windows, next time i go in 
a few weeks i'll take a look. if by then you don't need it, someone else 
will.
