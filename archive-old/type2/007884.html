Hi Y'all,
I was on the list briefly back in the early spring &amp; made an inquiry about
a massive oil leak in my orange '73  Westy w/ penthouse pop top, (the
&quot;pumpkin&quot;). I got several responses about the oil gallery seal plugs behind
the flywheel.  I pulled the motor &amp; sho enuff, the sucker was lying there
in the bottom of the bell housing. I drilled, tapped, &amp; installed a plug in
the one that was out, and repeated the process next to the one that was
still in, screwing in a cap screw so that the head overlapped the plug.  It
seemed like a better idea than pulling the remaining plug , drilling &amp;
tapping. (less chance of swarf getting into the motor).
So,  I've been happily driving the 'ole girl all summer.  THANK YOU to all
who responded !!
Now to the next project, rust!, the pumpkin has a softball sized hole in
front of the RR wheel, small (dime sized) holes under the sliding door and
in the same panel on the drivers side. The battery area needs repair, &amp; the
panel under the motor hatch, behind the rear bumper is almost completely
gone. There are also patches of surface rust in various places (rain
gutters, nose panel behind the spare, etc.) 
The structure underneath &amp; windshield area are fine so I think welding in
some body panels &amp; a paint job would give her a new lease on life. 
questions;
1. Has anyone had experience with the body repair panels sold by J.C.
Whitney?
2. Does anyone know of a panel for the area under the motor hatch?  Should
I look for a donor bus &amp; cut out the whole section (inner &amp; outer panels) &amp;
weld them in?
 3. When I took the westy top off &amp; installed the penthouse, I was left
with holes in the roof panel over the front seats, do they have to be
welded up, or will one of the epoxy products work as a permenent repair?   
  (I put a dab of silicone in each that has worked fine for 8 years, but
won't do to paint over)              
 4. Years ago I bought front window glass trim with new outside
weatherstrip, ( the one that is supposed to stop water from running down
the glass &amp; into the door panel). It came with no instructions, &amp; the
service manual dosn't  go into much detail. They are still in their
packaging. Anyone know where I can get some detailed instructions? I did
make up some weatherstrips &amp; silicone them in to keep the water out, but
they look like s#%_at_, &amp; the pumkin deserves better.
