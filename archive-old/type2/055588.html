&gt; &gt; My latest challenge is that of mileage calculation.  Being
pre-leaded 
&gt; &gt; (except for Led Zeppelin!) this is my first dealing with a 2&quot; pump 
&gt; &gt; inlet.  I am used to the unleaded click when your tank is full and 
&gt; &gt; calculating from that, I now stare blankly down a black hole with
petrol 
&gt; &gt; streaming into it.  I don't want the stuff sloshing around
everywhere by 
&gt; &gt; filling it to the tippy top but I need some consistency in my
life, you 
&gt; &gt; know?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; How can one set a standard filling point?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; No need.
&gt; Even on cars without the unleaded filler restrictor, the pump will cut
&gt; off when the tank is full.  I've found this to be the case in the '75
&gt; Beetle I once had, the '78 Bus I once had, and the '74 Ghia I now
have,
&gt; none of which have the unleaded filler restrictor.

If you're trying to get exact measurements, relying on an automatic
shutoff isn't the way to go.  They are notoriously inconsistant.

It is better to set a definite level in the filler and then fill the
tank to this level each time.  The level need not be the very top, but
can be a few inches down inside the filler.

Personally, I love the VW's big filler.  After fighting with the
&quot;standard&quot; US pre-restrictor fillers and even a couple of those
horrible  restricted fillers I'm happy to have that huge easy-to-fill
hole on the bus.  My father's new Mercury has a long narrow filler
tube that shuts off _3_ gallons before the tank is full!  Sheesh!
