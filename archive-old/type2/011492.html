15,16,17, a LiMBO and VVA event.  For info send e-mail to:
bussesbythebuoy_at_yahoo_dot_com

Sorry for the oversight. Thanks Melissa.

&gt; Hey there Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; With Summer slowly fading, the last of this years New England VW
&gt; events are coming up in the RI/MA area. Trying to plan my schedule,
&gt; this is what I found. 
&gt; 
&gt; The first is the Rhode Island Volkswagen Associations Labor Day
&gt; weekend car show (Sunday 9/3). Details can be found here:
&gt; http://ourworld-top.cs_dot_com/ScootsGTV/id20.htm
&gt; 
&gt; Campers on Cape Cod is happening Sept 29th thru the 1st of Oct.

&gt; 
&gt; Then there is Transporter Fest on Sunday Oct. 1st in Brookline, MA.
&gt; http://members.xoom_dot_com/Cape_Westys/COCC2000/Page_8x.html
&gt; 
&gt; There is also a vw show on Martha Vineyard Island MA on Oct. 8th.
&gt; Email addy and phone# is on the LiMBO events page:
&gt; http://bcn_dot_net/~limbo/
&gt; 
&gt; And although Pennslyvania is not technically located in New
&gt; England,
&gt; I'd figured I'd add Busses By The Trail, in mid-Oct.

&gt; 
&gt; Mapquest_dot_com says that it will take me only 5hrs 39mins to get to
&gt; Lenhartsville PA, Hmmmmm..... If I take the Friday off...
