Subject: Aftermarket ragtops
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Has anyone installed an aftermarket ragtop in their
bus? If so, how did it go? How long have you had it
in? Are you satisfied with it? Where did you get it?
Does it leak/sag? Has it discolored? Did you get
canvas or vinyl?

I ask because I'm considering putting one in my '71
Bus, and the only one I've seen was the Street Beat
rag for the Beetle, and I wasn't overly impressed. It
was beautiful when my friend first installed it, but
now it sags quite a bit. I figure if a rag that size
for a beetle sags, then it's only going to get worse
when you figure a rag the size of the one that goes on
the bus.
