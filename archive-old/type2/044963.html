Subject: [T2] RE: Mark Kaylor's '78 Bus

&gt;I *think* I may now possess the rarest of the rare in bay window parts,
&gt;BTW...  a Wolfsburg (funky reddish brown) radio block-off plate :-)

                          
Darn, I thought I had the only one! 

It's in the glove box of my '78 Champagne Edition Westy.  Guess the value
just went down...
