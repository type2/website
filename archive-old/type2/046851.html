Subject: Re: [T2] Full flow gurus needed

I have had many good oil tight fits with the 90 after relieving the squared
edges and face of the fitting just until it clears the clearancing you did to
the case.  Then install an NPT to SAE adapter.  I use 1/2 inch fittings and
hose.  High temp / high strength (#272) lock tight.  I have the hoses made up
from high temp and high pressure hose and SAE fittings at a local heavy
equipment shop.  Many full flow sets come with 3/8 inch hose.  Look into the
end of that 3/8ths hose.  Looks more like a 1/4 inch restriction doesn't it.
A lot smaller than the oil pump passage.

You can do it.

&gt; My questions are:  How have others fit this fitting?  Is there a type
&gt; of 90 degree fitting that I haven't seen?  (hydraulic hose shop showed
&gt; me all they had)
