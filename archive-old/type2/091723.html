Subject: Re: Camping AC set up.

Mike,

The answer to this  simple--
I just eliminated one item in your thought process--&quot;stand&quot;

One less thing to be carrying around, one less thing to manufacter, and
no chain to carry--:&gt;)

A 5000 BTU unit doesn't really weight squat anyway---so no big deal
getting it up there, and the 3&quot; inch dense foam under it will hold down
the vibes to a dull roar---

I'll test this luggage rack concept out this weekend---


Later,

Terry

Why bother putting it up there? Stand it outside, isolate the output
(take off the AC grill) and feed it into the bus through a vent window!
Quieter too. Provide an outlet fof the pressure by opening a poptop
window a bit. Of course you may have to chain it to the bus (+

the

=A0=A0Now I run it to the screen / window of the upper bunk, with
another piece of masonite, or plywood, with the correct circumference
hole. I just lay the plywood up against the inside of the pop top--and
crank the AC unit on----n8-
