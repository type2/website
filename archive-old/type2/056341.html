Subject: Westy Window rubber and Blaupunkt model number for '67 splitscreen.
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hi,

I've found 6 &quot;Westfalia window&quot; (all splitscreen) but they all come without
the window rubber.
Does anyone know if the window rubbers are still available (original or
aftermarket)

I'm also looking for the model number and /or part number off a blaupunkt
radio for in my '67 splitscreen.

Thanks,
Gunther
