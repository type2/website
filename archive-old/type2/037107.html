Subject: Re: Rear brake backplates on a 74

Hi

I recently tackled the back brakes on my 74.  Changes the pipes, cylinders
and shoes.  I also noticed that the backplates were shot.  I now have new
backplates and I am going to install them.  Is there anything else I should
have on hand for when I do the change.  I think I need 1 seal for the hub,
but my Haynes doesn't seem very clear on this.


Any advice etc..

Thanks
