&gt;O great and powerful list ---
&gt;
&gt;Soon after installing KYB gas-adjust shocks all around
&gt;on my 74 Westy (nice not to have to consult the
&gt;turn-and-bank indicator when rounding an easy curve),
&gt;I noticed a noise, best described as a &quot;snick&quot; or
&gt;metallic &quot;click&quot;, coming from the general area under
&gt;the driver's seat each time I hit an irregularity in
&gt;the road.  The shocks that came with the loaf were
&gt;worn and really spongy; stiffening the ride has prob.
&gt;overly stressed another part of the suspension.  Sound
&gt;familiar to anyone?
&gt;
&gt;Also, I assume that if I can grab the tie rod section
&gt;that connects to the right front spindle, and twist it
&gt;back and forth on its joints with almost no
&gt;resistance, that it's 'bout time to fix it?  TIA.
