Subject: Lightest, smallest packed size side tents?

Of all the side tents, new and vintage, what is the tent with either the
smallest packed size and/or the lowest weight? I wish the bus depot had at
least shipping weights listed on their tents.
I had what they call a &quot;Hanover&quot; which was a &quot; Adria II &quot; a couple years
ago. Poles are too long and it's a bit heavy. I am mostly interested in the
DOME shape ones to withstand heavier weather as well.
Thanks,
Al
