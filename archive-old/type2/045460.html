Subject: [T2] Removing doors (and general unseizing question)

Bus people:

Happy Friday!  I'm trying to remove the doors from my 69 Westy, in order to
replace them with others that I'm picking up this weekend.  I've bought a
metric hex set, and tried to remove the bolts from the hinges, but any
attempt I've made to turn the bolts has just resulted in stripping out the
inside of the hex.   Any techniques for getting these things off the
vehicle?   I may have already stripped the nut, and if this is the case,
could I drill it out, or use any other techniques?   I'm also having
problems removing the rear hatch latch which is seized.   I've tried using
WD40 in both cases repeatedly.   

Any disassembly gurus out there?

Jason
