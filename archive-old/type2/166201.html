Subject: Re: Suspension upgrades

 should I install the EMPI front and rear sway
bar kit and renew my KYBs front and rear, or should I &quot;back out&quot;, and leave
the &quot;westy&quot; as is....factory suspension, etc.?  I love to go through the
&quot;twistys&quot; in the mountains here, and built the motor up enough to do it, now I
have to make the suspension adapt.  Any sugestions are muchly appreciated!
Sid

Sid,

I'm on digest and just saw your post. You've been given good advice already re the swaybars. I found swayaway (or something like that) and installed some time back. I, too, put KYB Gas shocks on my '74 Riviera. Worked fine. 

Recently installed the much vaunted Konis and better yet. Now I don't drive &quot;Gottdamerung&quot; much and didn't have 100 miles on the KYB's when I pulled them. If you want them, they're yours for shipping and a bit for the List treasury. They don't look new but they really weren't used at all.
