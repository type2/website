Subject: Re: [T2] [BP] What is this-Is it a compressor??

I don't know, another guy in Canada found it on the Samba. He said the
original owner didn't know what it was either! Tom

ps to Howard- I also thought of model airplane engines, but they have glow
plugs don't they??

Now you have me wondering and thinking about getting that thing, what ever
it is, into my bus.
Notice the large heat sinks with nice sized SCRs attached to them.  Now
that is an interesting twist.

What was the original ad that you found that in?

Scott
