&gt;&gt;&gt;What I started doing on my vehicles in Germany is to totally remove all
&gt;&gt;&gt;undercoating there is, wirebrush (or preferably sandblast) all rust away
&gt;&gt;&gt;down to the bare metal or still existing original paint (if it withstands
&gt;&gt;&gt;a wire brush, there is no rust under it), use Fertan (turns remaining rust
&gt;&gt;&gt;in the pores into some other black substance), apply a couple coats of
&gt;&gt;&gt;good rustproofing primer (no POR 15),
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;What's wrong with POR-15?  I have seen auto parts painted with that stuff
&gt;&gt;and it came out looking like baked enamel - very nice.  I was considering
&gt;&gt;painting all of my tin with that stuff.
&gt;&gt;

&gt;
&gt;I have never tried POR-15, but anything that seals the metal from air will
&gt;prevent rust. By definition, rust is oxide of iron. No oxygen, no rust. I
&gt;have gotten excellent results from carefull preparation and good old
&gt;Rustoleum or Krylon. The tin on my Porsche looks magnificient with the wipe
&gt;of a rag after ten years. People walk up and look at the motor and
&gt;typically go, &quot;WOW, you really keep it clean!!!&quot; Yeah, five minutes with a
&gt;rag every year or 2000 miles. Simply maintained, perpetually, indefinatly,
&gt;ad infinitum.
&gt;
&gt;I have not heard of Fertan, but what is typically available at any marine
&gt;store around here is the similar rust conversion chemical called Ospho.
&gt;Stuff works wonders, and it will seep into seams, too. Should at least slow
&gt;down deterioration in places you can't get to. Be sure to let it dry, bone
&gt;dry, before final prep and overcoating. Use a good hot air gun to speed up
&gt;the process but be very carefull not to get things too hot. Just a big fan
&gt;strategically located to move the air around will dry things in a coupla
&gt;hours as good as overnight without.
&gt;
&gt;And as always, several medium-light coats properly spaced will prevent any
&gt;runs or wrinkling. When all else fails, read the instructions. Or, read the
&gt;instructions before you buy, and reduce the risk of failure (Murphy) to nada.
&gt;
&gt;Please forward this to the list or original respondent for me if you will,
&gt;Dave.
