Subject: Lower end life??

Well I guess it had to happen.  I did a compression check on my 79 westy
today and number three came up low at 65 psi.  Looks like a dropped valve
seat.  Not really surprised, the engine &amp; heads are original and has 135k.
So I sprung the big bux and ordered rebuilt AVPs from Ron.  I just hope I
can get them installed in time for BBA on labor day weekend.

I question whether I should do a complete teardown/rebuild.  This engine
has always run strong and smooth and cool (even with lo compression in #3).
I don't have an oil pressure gauge, but the pressure seems good since the
oil light never flickers at idle, even on hot days.  It doesn't burn oil
and has only recently begun to leak only a little oil from the pressure
sender.  Any thoughts here?  I haven't torn into it yet.  I understand that
the valve seats can contact the piston if they drop far enough, but I don't
think this has happened because it doesn't seem to make any noises that
would indicate this.  What can I reasonable expect to get out of the low
end of this engine assuming that there is no piston damage fron the valve
seat and assuming that this thing has been reasonably cared for during its
life (I've owned it for 8 years)??
