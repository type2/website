OK, thanks.

I will set some time next week (Sunday, perhaps) and get to the junk yard 
and pull the jump seat and some extra seat cushion material (yellow 
plastic).

Your note allows me to make my plans.  Thanks.

&gt;&gt;How difficult/easy would it be to replace the sink/cooler cabinet
&gt;&gt;with an extra (second) jump seat from a junk yard.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I found a 'decent' jump seat in a junk yard, and I don't know if it
&gt;&gt;would be easy to install a second jump seat behind the passenger
&gt;&gt;seat.

&gt;Might take more time get the sink out of the bus than a second jump
&gt;seat in. There are only four bolts holding it to the floor. Drill
&gt;hole use big washers to back up the nuts under the bus and you should
&gt;be good to go.
