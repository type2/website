&gt;Would a Vanagon inside handle fit a 70 Bay slider?
&gt;Tom
&gt;
&gt;70 High Roof
&gt;

Hello T&amp;T:

I don't know.

Probably yes.

The inside plastic sliding door handles for the 68 - 79  bays are listed as 
all the same in the catalogs.

However, I did see an early bay inside plastic handle that had the screw 
'offset' in the handle.  That is, it was not drilled right through the 
center of the handle.  The handle had the same look as others until I popped 
the little cap off.

I may have kept that handle, but that is useless info if I cannot show where 
it came from, particularly the post it was attached to.

Hint ! !   Strong hint  ! ! ! !   The square post that the plastic handle 
fits on is a tight fit for the Vanagon handle.  So, run a file against all 
four sides, and take the square post down ever so slightly.  If you do NOT 
DO THIS, you will be able to get the Vanagon handle ON the post, but not OFF 
THE POST ! ! ! .


If you have a square post with a screw hole down the center, then the 
Vanagon handle SHOULD fit.  (I would bet money on it and give you 10 to 1 
odds....)


A post script:  My (then) 8 year old boy, Jason, said to my (then) 5 year 
old daughter, &quot;Pick a number, 1 to 10; can't be '1', can't be '10&quot;  So my 
daughter said &quot;2&quot;!!           Amazed, Jason said, 'How did you guess??'

Of course my daughter heard the question as &quot;Pick a number, 1, 2, 10; can't 
be '1', can't be '10&quot; so she was more confused by his second question than 
by his first one.

So keep those questions coming and I won't answer any that I can't answer, 
except maybe the funny ones.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Enough talk.
&gt;
&gt;Now, take action!!
&gt;
&gt;The hinged metal Vanagon inside handles will fit nicely on the late bay
&gt;sliding doors.
&gt;
&gt;And because they are METAL, they have less of a tendency to break when you
&gt;are pulling the rear handle to close the sliding door.
&gt;
&gt;(While you are out camping . . . you use the rear handle because you are
&gt;considerate of people OUTSIDE the bus/camper when you are returning to the
&gt;bus/camper late at night after a visit to 'Maggie'; you are returning to 
&gt;the
&gt;bus/camper late at night after a visit to 'Maggie' because you are
&gt;considerate of others INSIDE the bus/camper)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;So, save the hinged metal inside slider handles from the Vanagons for 
&gt;future
&gt;recycling onto the late bays.
&gt;
&gt;If you have any doubts, check the prices for Vanagon handles at
&gt;WestCoastMetrics - $28 for black, $42 for brown
