Subject: high speed stench removed!

I was able to locate the stench, I believe, just this morning finally.
It wasn't anything underneath the bus, or hiding in any of the heater 
tubes/exhaust areas.

The sink. That little elbow in the sink that allows just a little bit of 
whatever you dump down there to sit until you flush it out with whatever is 
next. Apparently on memorial day weekend, at the group site we were at, 
someone thought it would be ok to dump the rest of their magic tea down 
there. well moldy, nasty mushroom looking stuff started growing in there and 
im guessing it only showed up at high speeds because the air vent for the 
sink would push the air through the sink and into the cabin.

I removed the elbow from the sink and cleansed it well, then ran as much 
cleaning agents as I could find down the rest and hopefully cleared out the 
rest if more was hiding in there.

I had never poured anything down there since I purchased the bus so I never 
thought to even check there.

BTW - anyone know how to actually drain the water the from ice box?
That little tube in there sticks up so far the water cannot drain out unless 
you fill it higher than .5 of an inch with fluid.
