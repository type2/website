Subject: RE: [T2] part needed

&gt; in this same picture  does anyone know 
&gt; where I can find the flexible accordian looking tube that 
&gt; joins to the right side of the heater fan?  (it connects it to the
plastic 
&gt; tube that runs over to the right which connects to a metal tube which 
&gt; goes to the heat exchanger.)  Or are there other solutions for
replacing
&gt; this NLA part? 


It looks like you're talking about this part, which we sell for $4.95:
