Subject: Exhust Problem-need help with parts!!

I had the bus checked out by a few shops over the weekend and got the
same result from each....we need a new exhaust system.  The good news is
that the heater boxes are in good shape and wont need to be repaired.  I
have a friend in PA that is helping me with the project so i wanted to
get the parts myself either from Rocky Mtn. or the bus depot i just dont
know exactly what i need for it.  I was told front pipes, tail pipe,
muffler, and gaskets.  So if anyone good help me out with the part
numbers or names it and the most economical way to go about this it
would be of great help.  Thanks for the advice
