Subject: Re: portable heaters? - try electric blanket!

This works for us- better to heat you than the air around you.  Get a
500 watt inverter, which runs in the vicinity of $99 at PeP Boys;
Camping World has them also.  I put it under the Westy rear seat, with a
heavy wire running right to the battery.  Then buy 2-3 electric 
Sunbeam lap blankets which are only 110 watts each.  You can put these
over your lap or across the back.  Toasty warm if you lay another
ordinary blanket over them.
