Subject: Re: [T2] F.I. to Weber carb conversion on a 2litre

switch to megasquirt!

It's probably cheaper than both routes discussed and it allows for full 
tunability.

it's neat-o! ;)

have a great day!
Mike



&gt; i changed mine on my 76, i wish i didnt
&gt; 
&gt; it wasnt hard to do, i needed a fuel pump, a few clamps, a length of
&gt; fuel line, the carb, manifold, seals, linkage (make sure you get the
&gt; linkage that makes your adjustment screws face the rear of the bus) i
&gt; think thats it....
&gt; 
&gt; the reason i switched was because my airflow meter was a 6th month
&gt; only part, and it was $750.....if i had known better, i would of
&gt; fixed it, or went with a solex dual setup....
&gt; 
&gt; the weber was a pain to get into tune, and i never seemed to get it
&gt; just right...while my fi was working, it ran so nice
