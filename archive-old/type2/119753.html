&gt; Would this work?  I. e., be mountable in the type 2 gas tank, still using

The picture is poor but I do not believe it would.  It looks to me in the
picture as though it is meant to mount by means of six screws.  This is
not an uncommon configuration but it is not the 1/6th turn system that
volkswagen uses.  The resistances are also wrong.  I do not have a T2 (bay
window) sender on hand but I do have a brand new T3 (vanagon) sender.
The resistances for the sunpro unit are on the left the vanagon
measurements are on the right:

&gt; Resistance specifications:

Sunpro                      Vanagon

&gt; Empty: 240 ohms           290 ohms
&gt; 1/4: 170 ohms             100 ohms
&gt; 1/2: 120 ohms              70 ohms
&gt; 3/4: 78 ohms               50 ohms
&gt; Full: 28.6 ohms            36 ohms

This was an interesting bit of research.  I have never looked at the
sender specs and had regarded it as a pass/fail device.  If it reads
correctly then leave it alone if not then replace.  The resistance curve
is very definitely looks non-linear but it is obvious from looking at the
resistance track that the wires are much longer in the last 1/4  than in
the preceeding 3/4.  It seems to have two different linear resistance
ranges.  For the first 3/4 resistance rises slowly then in the last 1/4 it
rises much faster.

On the Bus boys web page the T2 and T3 parts are listed as follows:

C.  211-919-051A Tank Gauge Sender, Late 1973 to 1979 (From Chassis #213
2138 901)  $46.50

C.  251-919-051E  Tank Gauge Sender, 2 Wheel Drive, 1980 to Early 1987 (To
Chassis #25-H-082433)  $39.70

On the original poster's question:  If you have broken the continuity of
the resistance wire then it is impossible to repair as a practical matter.
I am sorry to say you are up for a replacement.

                             OOK!
