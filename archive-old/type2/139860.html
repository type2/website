&gt; I'm new to the list, but not to busses. I'm having a strange problem with my
&gt; 76 Westy. It's totally stock, rebuilt by PO at some point, with an aux. oil
&gt; cooler that I added. It's having intermittent loss of power while driving
&gt; and sometimes stalling while idling. The loss of power at speed feels like I
&gt; shut off the key (of course, I not doing that!), until I tap the gas a few
&gt; times and the engine comes back online. It usually lasts from 1 second to 5
&gt; or 7 seconds, although it seems like an eternity while I'm gradually losing
&gt; speed. No lights on the dashboard come on when this happens.

check for loose wire connections, mine did something similar,, was a loose
connection on one of the small coil wires.
