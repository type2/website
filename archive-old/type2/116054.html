&gt; Hi Dean,

&gt; It'$ po$$ible to change the rear brake$ to di$k$, but it will co$t you

&gt; 
&gt; Replacing the rear wheel cylinders is an afternoon's work--  not more
&gt; than that unless you run into hidden problems while you're at it. Take
&gt; them apart  one wheel at a time so you can have something to compare to
&gt; if you have trouble remembering what went where.
&gt; 
&gt; When the rear brakes are adjusted properly they  are completely
&gt; adequate to stop a fully loaded bus. Since the front disks provide 70%
&gt; of the stopping power, I'd recommend you spend your money on better
&gt; tires and/or rims instead, you'll get better bang for your buck.

I will completely agree here with the drum rebuild.  I did both of mine for
$70 Napa parts.  They give AAA discount as well if you use that roadside
service.  Only other costs are fluid, possibly new brake lines, &amp; brake
shoes if you swap those at the same time.
