&gt; Hey all,
&gt; fri info request
&gt; My wife &amp; i am planning to go from the Raleigh area to Baltimore the 1st
&gt; weekend in Nov in our bus.
&gt; 
&gt; I will be in baltimore Mon night for the Dylan / Lesh show.
&gt; I'm looking for a nice / safe campground to stay at in the close
&gt; vicinity to Baltimore.  preferably an all night camp ground w/out &quot;gates
&gt; lock at 9pm&quot; since I will not get to campground till ~1130, 12 pm

you looking for full utilities or a Wal-Mart parking lot???

there is a KOA about half way between Baltimore and Washington, bit pricy
but all utilities last time I wandered through...also a state park or two.

how far you wanna search in the dark after a concert, or will you set up
before hand??
