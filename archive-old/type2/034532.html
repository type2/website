Subject: Re: cylinder head size

Justin,
ive had the same problem getting ahold of him. 
initially it was a response right away, then it took
him 2 weeks to get me the part once he got my check,
and it took him a week and a half to respond back to
my email that the head was incorrect and would take
him at least 3 weeks to get the money back to me if
hell refund it, so everyone out there should use
caution when dealing with this guy.  his name is sam
gingold and he lives in silver spring maryland

&gt; I can't say that I've had any definitive &quot;problems&quot;
&gt; with him, but I
&gt; certainly got plenty of not-so-fuzzy feelings.
&gt; 
&gt; I recently bought a complete 2.0 litre longblock
&gt; from him - in fact I drove
&gt; all the way from GA to VA to pick it up.  The price
&gt; was certainly
&gt; reasonable, but he obscenely asked me for gas money
&gt; (no prior mention of it)
&gt; and the heads that he gave me, despite his cautions
&gt; otherwise, were fried.
&gt; Unfortunately, this is my first engine transplant,
&gt; so I honestly know very
&gt; little about determining the condition of the
&gt; longblock.  He said it only
&gt; had 58k miles, but you know how that works.
&gt; 
&gt; Additionally, whereas before the actual transaction
&gt; he'd quickly respond to
&gt; every e-mail, now it seems getting ahold of him is
&gt; going to be a problem.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm interested in knowing if anyone else on the list
&gt; has had dealings with
&gt; him..?
&gt; 
&gt; Justin
