&gt; i couldn't use your link for that jack but what i use is an ATV jack from
&gt; harbor freight with a board on top, drops down to about 3 inches and works
&gt; quicker and safer than anything else i've ever used to pull an engine.

I use a transmission jack for engine removal, have a Harbor freight
manual crank model now but will get a hydraulic soon for the ease of
getting it up.    (basically trying it out with the cheaper crank up
model, find it works great so will shell out for the hyd)
