Subject: Dormobile progress

Hey y'all
Had the last 3 days off (found out at the last minute) so instead of
playing Tetris I did some work on the Dor.  When I helped my friend Jeff
tear the rear end off his donorbus I scored a buncha metal from the
side.  Tuesday morning I cranked up the wee wirefeed welder and went to
town.  I had bought a passenger side piece and still had to cut it to
fit and ended up with a bunch left over.  I welded the passenger side
Tuesday and cut a piece from the donorskin for the drivers side.
Wednesday I took a look at the piece I had cut and decided I didn't like
the fit so I started over.  THe drivers side was much worse and I had to
manufacture the upright from the step to the floor.  I hadn't welded in
over 20 years but the wee wirefeed did good.  This morning I finished
the drivers side and as an added bonus banged the dent out of the right
rear and replaced the battery tray with more donorskin.

While I was engaged in that project my lovely wife decided she wanted to
help by recovering the front seats.  They came out really nice and we
sat in them for a while making driving bus noises.  The neighbors are
used to us doing strange things so we are still not put away in the
happy residential place with the nice people in the white coats.

Then just as I finished that UPS showed up with a 90lb box of engine
bits.

So could life get any better?
Dave
