Subject: Re: [T2] sliding door problem

I have had problems with my sliding door since i've owned my bus (76) 
including this &quot;not opening&quot; delimma.  In my case I discovered the 
problem was due to a maladjustment in the stiker plate opposite the door 
handles.  In other words - the keep in mind your sliding door is closing 
on two ends - side with handles and the side without (where the hinge 
is, camper closet, and everything).

I got it to open by doing the following.  From the inside put the handle 
in the open position as if you were trying to open the car.  It's good 
to have a friend do this while you try the next part.  whith a large 
screw driver go to the opposite end (still from the inside of the car) 
and try to unhook the door from the striker plate.  It's the round 
little knob.  It might need a small shove but it should pop free.

good luck

&gt;i am hoping someone will be able to help me....i have a 71 camper and the sliding door will not open amymore.  and i'd imagine that i cannot take the handle off/apart if i cannot open the door.  does anyone have any sugestions?  my very reliable mechanic said he would basically have to take the door off/apart to get to the root of the problem.  and if there is any other way i would appreciate it.
