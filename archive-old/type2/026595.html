X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Hello all:

First, thanks to those of you who responded to my original cry for help.
Unfortunately, none of the suggestions was the problem, not even the
spraying of WD-40 to spot a vacuum leak.  So, I'll be pulling the left valve
cover off tomorrow between rain drops.  If I find anything interesting, I'll
let everyone know.  If it's some stupidity of my doing, I'll be really quiet
and maybe everyone will forget that I even asked for help in the first
place.

Jim Hood

P.S. :  It was brought up by several list members, but I'll re-iterate -
Yes, it's a good idea to change only one thing at a time.
