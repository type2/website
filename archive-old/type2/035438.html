&gt; I wonder why any shop that rebuilds heads (welding cracks, replacing and

&gt; process, but it can't be rocket science.

asked the guy that rebuilt my last type 4 engine and he said he does that
to ALL heat seats on ALL engines VW and other.  had a set of &quot;seat peens&quot;
for all the different size valves on a shelf, watched him do it, couldn't
have taken more than a few minutes per head, (but he did other things
between each valve etc)

&gt; (The fact that MSHP doesn't guarantee the head, only the seats, is 
&gt; meaningless in the first year if you pay with a credit card -- American 
&gt; Express, anyway -- since the products is defacto guaranteed. Even so, I 

don't count on American Express coming to your aid, they failed to do
anything about the GEX engine that I bought on American Express and failed
before I had made the payment,  went to court everything, American Express
told me &quot;you pay us and take care of it yourself&quot;!!!!   absolutely no help
at all.
