&lt;&lt; Ever look to see what the PO's kids might have shoved up your rear heater 
 ductwork? I found: two pens, an open book of matches, and a bottle cap.
 I feel much safer now knowing that I don't have matches in my heating system.
  &gt;&gt;
Things also fall into the ductwork through the defroster openings on the 
dash.  I put an inline bilge blower in my heater vent after I had cleaned it 
out, I thought.  It only took about a week for the extra force of the blower 
to collect enough junk to break the plastic fan baldes.  The second time I 
hooked up my lawn blower and really cleaned it out.  Haven't had any trouble 
since but there was a lot of residue in the system.
