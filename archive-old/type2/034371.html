I was completely successful if not lucky in towing my 78 Westy behind my
Jeep Cherokee from Texas to Georgia.  However, I left all four wheels on the
ground as I had a tow-bar installed.  Additionally, I took the extra
precaution of installing a transmission oil-cooler.

While many listees may say that I was lucky in not damaging my tranny / CVs,
my Bus (and Jeep) made it just fine -- and probably enjoyed the exercise!
