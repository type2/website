Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [T2} help me!!! he cries.....intermittent loss of
  power

Bob,

Wasn't there someone who finally figured out that one of their hoses from 
the tank to the fuel pump was collapsing on them?

1.  How about not just &quot;checked&quot; but &quot;replaced&quot;.
2.  Something floating around in the tank that covers up the intake.
3.  Tank vent hole plugged or covered?
3.  Grounds all inspected/replaced?  Look at the wires where they are 
	crimped on.  
4.  Possibly the pertronix, although most folks insist that they
	don't go bad, just die.
5.  Wires to the fuel pump checked for tightness?
6.  Pertonix wires where they come out of the distributor not rubbing raw?
7.  Bad ignition switch intermittent connection?

Q.  Better or worse in the heat/cold?
Q.  Better or worse over smooth or bumpy roads?
Q.  When this happens, and you take it out of gear, does it die or idle?
	(yes I read that it never stalled).


Cheers ,dave

&gt; at any speed and any time the engine loses power for a moment or a minute
&gt; then comes right back, when running it is dern near perfect.... but it has
&gt; this intermittent, and I have tried to find a pattern nada. it has never
&gt; even stalled, just no power... then back like new, will happen once oor a
&gt; dozen times while driving, at any speed, in any gear, in any throttle
&gt; position.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; have
&gt; 
&gt; timed',
&gt; new fuel filter
&gt; checked connections
&gt; checked hoses
&gt; replaced coil
 replaced timing advance vacuum unit (it did need that anyway)
 checked plugs (all a nice grey color)
 replaced dist cap and rotor
 checked all electrical connections
 
 need to check fuel presure
 need to find my old .009 dist and stick in.
&gt; 
&gt; any other thoughts before I push it off a clift??  well maybe just a curb
&gt; but this has been driving me nuts for a couple months now.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
