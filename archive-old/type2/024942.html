I moved to Seattle from Chicago about a year and a half ago.  Back home
I had access to my folks garage to do major work when it required.  At
present I've been forced to do this work in the street, including
dropping the engine a few times.  Although this has encouraged
socialization with my neighbors, it has provoked curiosity from local
law enforcement.   Are there others in my situation?  If so, what
options are available.  I suppose I can find a garage to rent but these
are a rare commodity in the center of Seattle.  Do any of the storage
rental places offer suitable facilities.  I suppose there is an issue
with fire ordinances and insurance.  If I do find a garage, I figure the
owner would feel the same way the storage suppliers would. Anyone in
Seattle interested in lending out their garage from time to time?  I can
supply a lending hand in times of need, beverages, or what have you. I
have some rust holes I would like to patch and also I need to re-torque
the heads.  I don't want to have to drop it in the street again and I'm
sure the neighbors don't want to see me doing so. Rain is a major factor
in all this too.
