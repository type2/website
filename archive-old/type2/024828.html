Message-Id: &lt;926700977.377.860_at_excite_dot_com&gt;

I have the stock shifter in my '77 Bus and want to
switch it over to the empi &quot;trigger&quot; shifter. A fellow
Bus lover has one in his and it shifts very easily, no
hunting gears.

I am just wondering if this will mean that it will shift
in the standard &quot;H&quot; pattern? Someone even suggested I
can't just change my shifter, that I would have to change
my transmission???!!! (no,please!!!)

Any ideas?
