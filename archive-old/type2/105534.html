Subject: Re: [T2] First Ride

Mike,

You will find this happens a lot....it is a *good* thing!

I get in conversations at the gas pump about every 3rd time I
fill up....with someone who admires the bug and wants to talk VW's!

Stopped by a flaps yesterday and bought some GL4 tranny lube...talked to 
the counter man who wanted to know why I didn't want GL5..explained it was 
bad for VW's...he says, &quot;you have a vw?!&quot;..walked out and looked at it
and started talking about his cache of 10-12 bugs/vert/t3's sitting in the
woods getting rusty....this happens a lot in Arkansas.  :-(((

Gonna go see them soon!!!...now if I just had more room....

Cheers, dave

&gt; Just for the record, I've run into a problem that I didn't have 2 decades
&gt; ago with my first bus.  Almost every time I park the bus someone comes up to
&gt; admire it and talk 60's/70's (in spite of the sadly PO neglected body)!  One
&gt; guy even followed me home to ask about Giacomo and to talk about his own
&gt; bus!!!  Totally cool. :O)
&gt; 
&gt; One dear fellow mentioned that he use to have a number of VW's (seemed like
&gt; the whole family had their own bus/beetle), and now no longer needs his VW
&gt; tools and books.  Service manuals, VW-specific specialty tools, even a work
&gt; bench-mounted engine frame.  I made an offer to purchase it all from him,
&gt; and he's going to get it all together and think about a price.  Nice.  I'll
&gt; list the goodies when I find out what they are.
