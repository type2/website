TURN IT OFF AND LEAVE IT OFF!!!!!

&gt; I've got a quick question about my engine which has some major problems.
&gt; Sometimes when I'm driving I find that the engine will not engage - it's
&gt; jolts back and forth as though going through a bad gear change but isn't.
&gt; The fuel pumps seems to be leaking as there's gas all around it and the fuel
&gt; gauge on the dash jumps all over the place once under 3/4 of a tank.

fix that gas leak before you even put your key in the ignition switch.

get a big fire ext.
