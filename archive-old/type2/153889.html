Subject: Another Aux battery Q

I have a battery isolator in my bus which runs to two lighter type outlets.
What is the advantage and or dissadvantage to the relay type sold by german
supply vs. the isolator I have. It does take up more space in the engine
compartment. Should I use the isolator or relay? I have always been curious to
have a simple (non-electronic engineer:) explination, please.
Meg
