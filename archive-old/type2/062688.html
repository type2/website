I had wierd hesitations (mostly skipping at high rpm) in my 78 bus after a
rebuild. Drove me nuts. Turned out, the screw that holds the condensor to
the side of the distributor wasn't tight enough, thus my condensor was only 
intermittently grounded. Tightened the screw, and drove off happily into
the sunset.

If the 81 still has a condensor, might be worth a check.

Good luck,
