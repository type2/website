$50 bucks is a good price for your seats.  I have a salvage yard here in the
Dallas area that sells all their seats for $50.00 a pair but you have no
idea what they came out of since they are already pulled.  they are under a
roof but the sun and weather still gets on them from the sides, hence if you
don't get them within a couple of days after they put them out your going to
spend a lot of time cleaning.  So to answer your question...HELL yes, get
them, if they are in good condition.
