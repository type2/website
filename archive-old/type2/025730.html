&gt; yes, I'm considering selling the bus.
&gt; 
&gt; Someone talk me out of it.

If you buy another car, and it acts up (watercooled cars like to act up in
expensive ways that require thousand-dollar gauges to diagnose and the whole
Snap-On tool catalog to fix) you'll think to yourself, &quot;I could have fixed
this for fifty bucks with a 13mm combination wrench if I'd have kept my
Bus.&quot;

When you find out what antifreeze costs, and what you have to do to get rid
of the old stuff at yearly antifreeze changing time, you'll think to
yourself, &quot;I didn't have any of these problems with the Bus.&quot;

When you go to Home Depot and pick out six sheets of drywall, four rolls of
insulation, a bag of mud mix and the rest of the stuff you need to build the
new storage room in the basement, then realize as you're standing in line
that all that stuff isn't going to fit in the Honda Civic you're driving
now...

And I never heard of a High Country Oldsmobile Festival, or Toyotas Nowhere
Near the Arch.
