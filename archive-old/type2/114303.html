&lt;&lt;  the guy said that someone drove it up from myrtle beach and left it there 
or something of that nature...
told me he just wants to get rid of it and get it out of his parking lot....
i myself and i dont know much about buses would not pay over say hmmmm 350 
-400 bucks for it.. he might take it....?

But does it have a &quot;clean&quot; bill of sale/title...?
Just because 'somebody left it' doesn't give
the property owner the right to sell it; call
the police and have it impounded, probably
yes...I went through an interstate donny-
brook over a car I lost the title to and
wouldn't want to do it again. Even if the
property owner has a title, I'd get it searched
before I put down any money...There's al-
ways the chance the guy who left it
wasn't the owner...
