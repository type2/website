I think the tool I have used by itself most often would have to be my
Leatherman Tool... 
	Otherwise, I like my little kit with the lighter/solder/heat shrink
tape in it. When it is time for a new wiring connector, (after crimping
the new one on), it does a lot for permanency's sake to solder the
crimped area and then shrink some of that tubing down on there. Really
nice... Just don't forget to put the shrink-tubing on there before you
crimp the connector on ;)
