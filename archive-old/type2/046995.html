Folks,

Just as Mr. Dolan suggested, you and I are just as subject
to solvents as motor oil is.  Things that are lighter still
do not get blocked by biological processes.  I'd have you
talk to my friend about how good benzene is for degreasing,
but he's dead from it.

Have any of us built a home-workshop fume hood?
