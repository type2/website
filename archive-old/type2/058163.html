Subject: What's it worth

Hi volks,
	Well, I've got the '78 Bus cleaned up, tuned up, and detailed, so I am
going to try to sell it as I think I can do pretty good compared to what
I bought it for. It's in decent shape, with the only major rust on the
step coming into the passenger side, and some holes on the base of the
passenger door. all the parts are there for a stock resto, even the
original owners manual. What would it be worth in your part of the USA?
I would like to trade it for a project, either an older van (split) or a
early 60s vert, and would appreciate your value judgements...
Aloha,   Gary in Hilo, Hawaii
