Subject: [T2] Bus --&gt; Vanagon rear brake conversion

&gt; As I was flipping through the latest RMMW catalog I began to wonder if
it's
&gt; possible to convert the late Bus rear brakes to the late Vanagon
&gt; self-adjusting rear brakes.

Err, sorry, didn't mean to say late Vanagon, just Vanagon in general, was
thinking early Vanagon when I wrote it.
