Subject: RE: Need Exhaust Advice....

&gt; &gt;My '77 Westy is in need if a quality exhaust. I currently have an Empi
&gt; &gt;Monza style that has rusted to pieces in 7 months. I would like
&gt; &gt;something that is good quality, preferably stainless steel. It also must
&gt; &gt;be as quiet as possible, I did the no baffle stinger thing when I was
&gt; &gt;18. Can someone recommend a good system from heater boxes back?

&gt; Kenny, can you say &quot;Original Equipment Manufacturer&quot;?


I'm sure he can say it, but equally sure that he can't get it. :-)  The
'75-78 U.S. spec busses used a crossover pipe which is no longer available
new.  This means that you can't replace everything behind the heater boxes
with an O.E. system, since without that crossover pipe, the stock muffler,
etc. are useless (having nothing to attach to).

Kenny, your best bet is to replace your heat exchangers with '72-74 heat
exchangers.  This will allow you to use a '72-74 stock exhaust system (used
thru '79 in Europe), which Dansk makes at a reasonable price and of decent
quality. (This assumes 49-state; if in California you would need '72-74
heater boxes with a ''79 exhaust system, which I also have, because it
accepts a cat whereas the '72-74 exhaust does not.)  If you must use your
'75-78 heater boxes, then the best I can suggest is the Pacesetter system,
which at $79 is IMHO far better than the Empi but admittedly nowhere near
the quality of OE.  Then again, given that OE is not available, at least at
$79 if it lasts you a couple of years you got your money's worth.

By the way, all of the info (and more) is in my new illustrated 50 page bus
parts catalog.  Details to follow within a few days.
