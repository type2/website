Subject: RE: [T2] Bus cover!

&gt;      I have a 73, non-camper with the spare inside the car 
&gt; (not mounted to the front). I keep my Bus garaged all the 
&gt; time, but with everything that goes on in a garage; 
&gt; occasional spray paint, popcorn ceilings dropping crap on my 
&gt; Bus, dust, and the off chance I accidentally bang into it... 
&gt; I figure the best protection would be a car cover. Does 
&gt; anyone know what would be the best thing to get? It doesn't 
&gt; need to be water proof as my Bus will never be stored outside.



This is the one to get.  The zippered access makes it much easier to use,
and the quality and fit are good.
