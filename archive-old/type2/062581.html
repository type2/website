Subject: Re: LOCK-RIGHT locking diffs

&gt; installation in 1-2 hours without resetting backlash
&gt; smooth operation without harsh noisy action
&gt; 100% locking as necessary with full differentiation on turns

There are basically (to my knowledge) three types of locking rears: 
splined, clutched, and pneumatic. Pneumatics are expensive and require an 
on-board compressor (not that uncommon in hard-core 4WD play). Splined 
units take no prisoners when they lock up but they're noisy and can be 
clumsy on wet blacktop. I believe this one is clutched. In principle it 
should work the same as the factory limited-slip rear, or posi-trac in an 
American car, but allowing no slip under stress.

I agree that if it's half the diff it's supposed to be, it's the deal of 
the century. Given the Bus's intrinsic high clearance and the weight over 
the drive wheels, there are not a lot of places I wouldn't try to go with 
a locking rear. The Bus is never going to be a rock climber because of 
its huge overhangs and high center, but with a Hi-lift jack and maybe 
some chains it could go practically anywhere a near-stock 4WD truck could go.

I'm putting one in when this trans wears out (won't be long...&lt;double 
clutch&gt;...&lt;gggggrind&gt;...).
