Subject: RE: MPG 78 Westy

My '76 with new 2.0 L AVP longblock and FI has averaged 14.0 mpg for the
last
5400 miles of mostly highway (60 mph) commuting.  I guess I'm saving
$300/month on
a car payment though...

There is a great table in the www.type2_dot_com library under Fuel that has
lots of folks
mileage results by year and fuel system type.

And I've gone through the fantastic troubleshooting section of the
library for FI under the
heading; 'Mileage Sucks'.
