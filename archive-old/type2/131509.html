Subject: RE: [T2] Distributor Orientation, Dohh!

Thanks everybody who respond to my offset dizzy. I actually had it right. 
What I meant by correct position was for the 205P with #1 and #4 parallel 
with the impellar housing. My posting a few months ago was about the 
difference in position from stock(205P) to the 009. While talking with my 
best bud Wes Brown another listee, we figured it out. I am a &quot;dumbass&quot;! 
Basically when I rebuilt the 205P I put the new condensor on incorrectly. I 
mounted it with the screw for the keeper that holds the square plug into the 
housing. It has been removed and mounted to one of the screws that hold the 
vac. can on the housing. All is well now and I flipped the switch on for the 
light bulb in my head about the all the vacuum lines tonight. I have a few 
pieces to pic up tomorrow and it should be done. I also have to figure out 
that rotor button deal but by this weekend everything will connected per 
spec. or better.

The unknown history of the FI system is the only draw back. You put all this 
work into putting something together &quot;used&quot; with as many new parts as 
permitted and you never know until you get it together if it is going to 
work. Many hands crossing fingers in my brain in preperation for that 
initial turn of the key.

Thanks,

&gt;I posted a while back about the orientation of the .009. I have since done 
&gt;away with it. Now I am installing the 205P and the condensor is hitting the 
&gt;tin, in the position that seems correct to me. That being the number one 
&gt;wire being at the rear(RIR) and to the right. Am I correct?
