Hello all,

On one of the more horrific and unfortunately memorable days in US histor=
y,
we were humbled by a telephone call from our buddy Tom Niedernhofer a
moment ago.  He works for the US Army Corps of Engineers (and might soon =
be
assisting in structural evaluation and search and rescue - his specialtie=
s
- in NYC) and he was on the Internet and saw posts from some of other our=

VW friends who, in the middle of this horrible disaster, were thinking of=

my wife Kathryn and I.  For those of you who don't know, Kathryn and I ar=
e
flight attendants for TWA (just bought by, and soon to become a part of
American Airlines).  As you know by now, the terrorists hijacked at this
point four commercial jets, two from American Airlines and two from Unite=
d
Airlines, and used them to cause massive damage and untold casualties. =

Kathryn was actually at work this morning boarding passengers onto a MD-8=
2
bound for Ontario, CA.  Once all USA flights were immediately cancelled,
she assisted the folks off the planes into the terminal, which in turn wa=
s
then evacuated.  She decided that since she wasn't going anywhere today, =
it
was time to go home, where I was enjoying a day off and safely watching t=
he
TV coverage.  So I am pleased to be able to let you know that we are both=

safe and sound together in our home near St. Louis.

Unfortunately, we have all lost a lot of our citizens, both on the ground=

and in the air.  Personally, as a flight attendant trained for all types =
of
emergencies including extensive hijacking training, nothing can prepare y=
ou
and your fellow comrades in uniform for what it must have been like insid=
e
those airplanes today.  Our prayers go out to all that were injured or lo=
st
their lives today, and to their families and survivors.  I have flown as =
a
B/A for just over 25 years, and my wife for over 31 years, and it is an
unusual, but very safe and fairly interesting occupation, until something=

like today happens.  It's just unbelievable!  =


I for one am hoping that we bomb the bastards who planned and executed
these attacks against all of us back to the Stone Age.  Violence seems to=

be the only thing these assholes understand, and I hope that our armed
services get the opportunity to air deliver as much of our high-dollar,
high-tech violence as possible to the guilty ASAP.  It sure won't bring
anyone back, but it'll sure make most of us feel a lot better that the
perpetrators of this attack against our country don't get away with this
&quot;scott free&quot;.

Thanks again for the concern for us that some of you have already express=
ed
via phone and Internet, and rest assured that we are both fine and happy =
to
be together today.

Bill ( &amp; Kathryn) Bowman

p.s.   Please say a prayer for my parents who during all of this are
currently airborne in a TWA widebody jet from London, England nonstop to
St. Louis today.  We aren't sure where they are or where they will land. =

They had planned to visit with us for 4-5 days.  Up to this point it soun=
ds
like they'll be landing in Canada so far.  Cross your fingers for us
please!
