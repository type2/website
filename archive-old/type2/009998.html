Hi List,

	Quick and hopefully easy question here.  In the process of my
engine rebuild, and we're replacing the bearings on the crankshaft, and we
came across this sentence in the book we are referencing:

&quot;An important part of VW connecting rod service is replacing the rod nuts.
_Always use new rod nuts_ for maximum strength and accurate torque
readings.&quot;

	The book we're using is &quot;How to Rebuild You VW Air-Cooled Engine&quot;,
by Tom Wilson.

	We never would have replaced them, and are wondering if it is
really necessary.  And if it is necessary, does anyone know where we can
get the nuts for a 1974, Type 4, 1800cc engine?

	Thanks guys,

	  Wade
