Subject: 78 Bus. Compufire setup, coil questions  (removing MSD)

Hi All,

My bus is running rough. I think I'm going to take it to my
mechanic to have him take a look at it, but I've decided to
return it to (almost) stock condition first. Right now it's got
a Compufire and an MSD ignition and a rats nest of wiring.
I'm going to take out the MSD and run it stock except for
the Compufire.

Here's my question:

With the MSD, there is no resistor on the coil. Should I have
one there after I remove the MSD and run with the Compufire only?

Does anyone have any hookup tips for the Compufire? It has been
so long since I put it in, I forget how to remove the MSD and still have
everything work.

Thanks much!

Mark
