Hey everybody,

   I am having the darndest time with my &quot;new&quot; bus. Thanks to all who 
replied on the Starter Bushing qeustion. But alas, one question always leads 
to another or so it seems. I got the new starter in and tried to turn it on 
with the key, and had no luck. I am right back where i started just a click. 
So I put the bus in neutral, emergency brake on, chalked the wheels, crawled 
back under the bus and briged the termeinals on the seliniod. BRmmmm the 
engine turned over fine.

My Question- What should I look at now? The Ignition Switch? Wires? I 
checked all fuses, all ok. If it is the ignition switch does anyone know 
where to get a wiring diagram for a 71 Campmobile Ignition Switch?

Cheers,

Joe

71 Type 2 Campmobile
