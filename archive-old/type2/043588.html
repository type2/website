Subject: Install snaggle on my 2L

Hey There.

I've spent the last 2 days scratching my head and installing and removing 
my 2L engine into my 77 westy. I had it in two days ago and I backed it 
out because I'd forgotten to grease the spline. That completed i proceeded 
to re-insert. Once the engine was all the way in and all 4 bolts tight i 
tried to turn the crank and she was a no go. So I backed out again. The 
engine will turn all the way around when 4-6&quot; out the i push it in to 
where it is 1/4&quot; out and it will turn but then hits a stopping point in 
either direction. I've tried turning the crank slightly and retying but 
with no success. I'm working solo so there is little simutaneous effort 
being accomplished. I've recruited a couple of volunteers for today 
hopefully they will show.

Any Ideas.  What's stopping it from turning   it is not in gear  it should 
spin all the way right???
