Subject: &lt;AIRS&gt; 81 Vanagon Help

Volks:

I got a call last nite from a couple of bussers having trouble with
their 81 Vanagon.  Neither knows much about VW or autos for that matter.

Symptoms:  Wouldn't start.  May have burned up the starter trying. 
Starter has been replaced.  Then, while driving noticed a loss of power.
Backed off the accelerator and it regained power.  They had a non-VW
mechanic &quot;adjust&quot; the timing.  Ran well, then sputtering/losing power
again.  Now it won't start. Starter working intermittently.

I'm trying to talk them thru as much as possible before I drive 2
hours.  

So Far:

Battery o.k.  Starter works most of the time.  
It has spark. 
I've got them trying to adjust the timing (without a timing lite).
Fuel Filters o.k.

I don't know much about the Type IV.  Is there anything they should
immediately check before trying to troubleshoot the FI system?

Please respond B/C.  I'm on Digest Mode.

Thanks 
Shawn Clark
