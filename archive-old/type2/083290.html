Bill,

The tube is about an inch in diameter and about four feet long.  the
purpose of the grease is to lube the nylon &quot;shuttlecock&quot; bushings against
the walls of the tube.  A thin coating on the walls is all you want.  You
really wouldn't *want* to fill the tube and if you did, it would be easy
enough to shove it in from the end.  There is a price to pay for
over-greasing, tho...  Water trapped between the wall and the grease
cannot evaporate.  It just stays there and rusts the tube.

As the conversation continues on replacing the bushings, I think it
important to ask... you all *have* crawled under there and made sure there
is a tube for the bushings to ride in, right?  I have seen some of these
tubes in *very* sad shape, such that replacing the bushing is easy... it's
hanging out in the open with shreds of rusty tube hanging from it!
