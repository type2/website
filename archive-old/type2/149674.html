Subject: Leaking aux air regulator?

Just pulled the drain plug for an oil change and waiting for the last dribbles
to make their way into the pan. While warming the engine I was poking around
trying to find the source of a rough idle. After running the engine for about
10 minutes I got around to pinching the hose that goes between the aux air
valve and the intake snorkle. The idle speed increased and seemed to smooth
out. I had tested this valve before I installed it last spring and it closed
when warm. When closed I tried to blow through it and only the slightest bit
of air would pass. I know that doesn't mean it's not stuck open now. :~(

Does pinching this hose and increasing idle when warm indicate a probable
leaky/stuck aux air valve? What happens on a good valve when the hose is
pinched when the engine is warm? From the description in my Bently I assume
there should be no change in idle speed. Is this right?
