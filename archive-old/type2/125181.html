Subject: Type 4 oil sender, what is best?? 

I've found in the archives that the dipstick senders are best in &quot;upright&quot;
motors.

 

But what about T4 motors??

Any other suggestions on location???

 

Does greater resistance (like crimp connectors, extra wire) display higher
or lower temps??

 

Thanks

MikeL
