Subject: RE: [T2] Road trip confirmed: Leaving Anaheim, CA for Denver,
  CO

&gt;From: Don Tuleja

&gt;Oh, man... I'm so nervous


Good Luck Don!

I have made a much similar trip recently, but I was not fortunate enough to 
have my bus ready to drive the trip. That would have been sweet. The last 
few weeks I saw many nights with no sleep or just a couple of hours. Lots of 
coffee and RedBull type energy drinks. Of course I was trying to finish up 
an engine for a friend who needed the help. Plus sorting through a sh#_at_ load 
of parts to get to someone somewhere besides the trash can. Thanks again Rob 
and John. I managed to forget a few things while I rushing up until the last 
minute, literally. The complete AC system from my bus was left in a dark 
corner of a storage shed I had, DOUGH! With the recent AC thread I know 
there are some of you that are weeping and others that are cheering. But oh 
well. I hope this trip and your new home find you and your family in a good 
way.


P.S. If you find some more of those friends that leave the parts in driveway 
while on vacation be sure to post a list so we can all benefiet from the 
free goodies.;-)
