&gt;  I bought a new sensor and then discovered
&gt;that there is no place in the tin for it to go. I have to start the bus
&gt;3 or 4 times to get it to run--it runs a second or two
&gt;each time, until finally after 3 or 4 time, it finally
&gt;keeps running. 

Know that you will wear out your starter/alternator/battery much faster if
you must use the starter 4 times for each start rather than one. Hotter
brushes wear faster, terminals get hotter, replacement of amps used goes
way up, putting extra demand on the alternator to replace them. 

Note also, if you hook up the temp sensor and ground it to the block, it
will send the proper signal to activate the cold start and idle even if
it's just duct tapped so as not to flop around. When the motor and sensor
are both at ambient temps, the signal will be correct to the ECU for cold
start, but only if the hot runnning adjustments are made with sensor temp =
head temp.

You could do this to test cold start functions. The problem is you won't
get proper signals for cold/warmup/hot running unless the correct head heat
signal is present. You cannot make the system work right hot and cold
without getting that temp sensor installed. Even a juris riggus which holds
the butt of the sensor against the head will work, thought the temp
responce is a bit longer.

I would at least try this. Bend up the tin in vicinity of #3 exh port,
wedge the sensor between the tin and head, then stuff something appropriate
in the air gap created to prevent cooling air loss. Be sure to readjust
timing/idle/mixture per Bentley (at fully warmed up running temp) after
getting that sensor mounted. Then see if you still have cold start issues
after it sat overnight.
