&gt; I would hope that someone else took that picture, and that you were not fiddling with the camera while driving 90 mph.

Unfortunately it was me. But I know my camera well enough to do
everything without looking and with one hand. Plus it was a wide open
freeway, no traffic. I did it like 30 times in case it didn't turn out
since I didn't want to be looking at the camera...
