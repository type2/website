Subject: Storybook busses at auction

 I haven't been up to see these busses, the inspection 
starts the morning of the auction, I do intend to go 
just to watch.
I begged the wife but cannot convince her of the 
investment value on these and other items that are 
available.  Check this web site.

Conrad is about an hour north of Great Falls Montana and 
the auction is another 20-30 mins from there.
Let me know if anyone is gonna make the trip, I'd like 
to get together and BS.
