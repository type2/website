Subject: Re: [Re: where in the westy?]

must have missed the thread but yes generally from late 64 -&gt; westy's came with a brass or metal tag affixed below the pull out bed that stated the model 
  westfalia interior you had.. 

  as well on early 60 westy's onwards (i am most familiar w/ westy's up to 67) 
  also specified the westy interior you had on the m-code tag attached behind the 
  pass seat on the metal bulkhead.. 

  p-mail me if you have any further westy questions and i will see what i can do 
  to answer it..
