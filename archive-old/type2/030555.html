&gt; Can the list help this guy out.  It's been a long time since I've been

hi again steve,

You could be right about the slinger washer too, but he can check that one
by removing the pulley, i didnt think of that one because itss so obvious
and easy to check!

its always the simple stuff that befuddles me it seems ;)

take care,

Steve
