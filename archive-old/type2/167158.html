Subject: windshield sill woes

Well I thought I had fixed my problems with my windshield
I filled the holes in the sill but after a couple rains here the
last week water is coming in over what appears the sill and
is sitting on my dash.

I think the lip of the sill collapsed or something.
Now I have to find someone other than myself to fix it
and doing some welding.

Argh.

Anyone want to come up to beautiful saskatchewan
and help me :)
