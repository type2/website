Subject: the type2 list FAQ!!!!

Hi aircooled busheads!

In a moment of foolishness I told Ken that I would compile a FAQ for
this list, and donate www space to store it.  So, if you all have stuff
you would like to see in a FAQ, want to help out, or whatever, let's
hear it. . . . .what do you wish someone would have told you when you
got on the list, the net, the bus. . . . .

email to me personally. . . . .
