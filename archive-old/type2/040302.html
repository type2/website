Subject: Re: Help with my '72 bus

I would check the donut shaped bushings that are between the spring plate and the
torsion tube.  My Bus had a similar problem and it drove me crazy trying to hunt it
down.  Sometime later, when I adjusted the rear suspension, I found the bushings were
badly worn.  I got it adjusted, put new bushings in, and the clanking noise went away.
Expensive?  All it took to fix was about 10 bucks and half a day.

&gt; 3. I have a very loud clanking sound coming from the rear of the bus when it
&gt; even crosses a small crack in the road. I can't identify it, but it sounds it's very
&gt; loud, and sounds VERY expensive. Any hints on what to look for?
