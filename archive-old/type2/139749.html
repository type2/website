&gt; &gt; Long block, full dress, heat exchangers, no muffler.  Sitting on a

&gt; My turnkey 2 L with muffler, strapped to a pallet roughly the same size as
&gt; the motor, with a waferboard crate built around it, weighed in just a hair
&gt; under 500 pounds US.

couple years back I shipped a long block from Calif to Maryland via Yellow
freight for just a tad under $100.  I was in a commercial area and it was
delivered in a Tractor Trailer so consider the delivery charge to. the
terminal to terminal route is a best bet.

Dang knew my engine was heavy last time I jacked it into my van.
