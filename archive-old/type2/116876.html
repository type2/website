Subject: Re: [T2] turning brakes/my bus baffles me...

&gt;You might want to take off the your left front drum, and then have a helper 
&gt;SLOWLY depress the brake pedal.  See if both wheel cylinders are active.

I have a 71 and have disk brakes up front....but maybe there's something 
wrong with the caliper??
