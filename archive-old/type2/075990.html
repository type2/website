&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The drawbacks are that they don't put out nearly the heat that the bus
&gt; &gt; exchangers do,
&gt; 
&gt; The reason for this: They are only pre-heaters for the BA 4 gas heater. The 411
&gt; used a bus-style blower motor up top in the air intake. This blew air thru the
&gt; mini boxes into the BA 4 mounted above the transaxle.
&gt; The BA 4 gas heater was an option. On 411's and 412's without it, they ran full

??? huh, I bought my wife a 412 from the dealer way back when and there
was no mention of it as being an option, it was just there....at least in
the USA I have yet to see a 411/412 without one

the Chilton manual which is the only one that mentions it says &quot;the Type
4, which also comes standard with an auxilliary gas heating system&quot;  later
it says &quot;the gas heater runs on gasoline from the fuel tank and is
avaliable as an option on type 2 and type 3 models  (section 6-12)

maybe you are thinking about the type 3??
or maybe non USA models?
or maybe the Chilton is wrong, wouldn't be the first time
