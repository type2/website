&gt;&gt;If the buzzer operates when the key is in but not turned then sure you
&gt;&gt;could wire a relay right into there.
&gt;&gt;Good idea.
&gt;&gt;

Concur, I will add:

That would work just fine for a stock type radio. I might be concerned
about what happens with key in radio on and you open the door. Will the
buzzer fry the radio? Not if you put the proper fuze in there. 

A relay, on the other hand, activated by that circuit would be needed if
your pumping up the power to a
wizbanghighwattoutputconcerthallthunderbassneighborhoodrattlingconcretefract
uring system, or anything with more draw than the buzzer. 

Alturnative II, put a switch in the coil feed wire. Switch it off when you
want a key on radio. Switch it back on when motor no start reminds you to
switch the ignition back on, you ape. Rote experience in apelike manner
will quickly develop into habitual behavior for those who know where your
remote switch is which also provides an item of anti-theft insurance.

You cannot be &quot;key in or on&quot; with the door open for tunes at the beach
unless it's Floyd's &quot;Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered
Together in a Cave and Grooving with a Pict&quot;, wherein buzzer on might be
appropriate. 

Try this. Pull the Buzzer relay, and always have a safety backup key so no
ape, you or otherwise, can possibly lock you out with the key locked in and
&quot;this sucks bigtime!!&quot;. Then wire the buzzer position appropriate for the
relay of your required capacity for your volumetric daily requirement of
Hendrix/Tull/WHO/yada/yada, with the door open, der key in der pocket, the
rips coming on clean and clear and, depending upon load, battery and
alturnator weaknesses that will have to be addressed if you really want to
ROCK!!....then START.

Stick with Mozart et al and have a lower wattage requirement and an
auxbattery set up to insure hours long campsiteinthewoods enhancement with
sure starts always available. You might even draw in a retinue of Furry
Animals with some BeetHoven clefts.
