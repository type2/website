Subject: Re: [T2] Help! - Now it's gas in MY oil!

I have never had this problem but I have read that a bad mechanical fuel 
pump on an upright engine (1300, 40Hp, 1600, etc) can cause gas in the oil. 
I don't know If this can happen on your 73 but I think that's one of the 
things I would look into. I think I remember you saying your engine seemed 
to run fine but got BAD mileage. If a torn diaphram in the fuel pump could 
leak into the crank case on your engine (1700 I think?) this could be the 
mystery leak you are looking for.

I have had bad fuel pumps on f*rds and Ch*vys. Usualy the engine still runs 
ok if the pump can make any pressure at all. the tell tale sigh on American 
engines is a puddle of fuel under the fuel pump. These pumps have a vent on 
the non pressure side of the diaphram to let air in and out of that side of 
the pump. If the diaphram is torn or cracked the fuel is allowed to leak out 
the vent and doesn't usualy get in the crank case.

Maybe some one else on the list knows for sure if this could be the cause on 
your engine?

&gt; It was all very fine and hypothetical when I was trying to help
&gt; someone else solve the gas in oil riddle, but now it's all very
&gt; different because now there is gas in MY oil!
