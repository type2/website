Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Temps and Breather Boxes

&gt;high crankcase pressure can be a sign of failing rings, as pressure blows
by
the rings in into the crankcase, but the stock breather system should be
able to handle this unless it is not working. make sure the breather box
and
hose are clear.

The motor is fresh. 8k since full rebuild. The stock breather does not vent
the heads as the solid lifters I am running seal that part of the motor
from the crankcase. The crancase venting is fine. Head venting is what I am
concerned about.
