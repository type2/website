Subject: need van parts source

I've just purchased an '82 GL (to keep my '84 GL company in the driveway) and, 
rather than rob the cosmetic parts from my '84, I'd like to find a source of 
new/used parts (preferrably close to me north of Boston). I've got a list a mile 
long so I wont bother listin' em till I get my needs under control. 

My first request......A source of reasonably priced parts to snaz up my '82!

I heard rumors of a big VW yard somewhere in the Boston area...??? 

any information appreciated. 

PS: I got a lotta questions..... You'll be hearin' more from me.
