Subject: M-code page moved

Hi everybody,

Due to an administration error at my school my homepage was removed
(they thought I quit my study). This happened about two weeks ago. Along
with a few other students we are trying to get our homepages back but
without results so far.

I have moved the page. To make sure it will be easy to find in the
future I decided to take a 'redirect URL'. Here it is:

	http://drive.to/m-codes

My personal VW-page moved as well:

	http://drive.to/vvv

Not all the links on the M-code page are working yet. If you have any
problems or questions feel free to send me a message.
