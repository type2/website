Subject: Re: [T2] Horrible acceleration 

&gt;  (I double checked timing and it was still dead on 10 ATDC).
 I just don't know what to check out........any help would be wonderful...

10 after at idle with a timing light?
If yes, put the light on it again and disconnect the vacuum hose going to the inboard nipple [the one pointing
towards the dist body].
Tell me what happened to the timing. Where is it now?
