Actually, not all wire feed arc welders are &quot;MIG&quot; welders.

MIG is a common-use term to describe the GMAW process (Gas Wire Arc
Welding).

The two popular forms of wire feed arc welding are GMAW and FCAW.  FCAW is
Flux Core Arc Welding.

Some (not all) FCAW process welders are convertable to GMAW.  Some GMAW
process welders are convertable to FCAW.

The FWAC process is not better or worse then GMAW, simply different.  Just
as TIG or brazing are different from GMAW and better suited for some
applications/situations.

If you'd like more information about the differences between FWAC and GMAW
you may want to read this article published by Lincoln:
