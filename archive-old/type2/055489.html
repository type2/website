Subject: early 70's poptop question

heres the deal. i have a regular 74 bus with a westy interior (a weekender)
and i want the poptop now :) so many questions! ok, first off, should i only
be looking for a 74 fiberglas poptop? or will other 70's year fit? whic
hyears had the luggage rack in the front and which had them in the back?
which years did the sleeping area pop towards the back and which popped
towards the front? i was at my local VW junkyard today (in south el monte,
CA) and they had 3 westy poptops. i looked at them...i made mental notes of
what to do to convert mine into a westy. the roof is exactly the same as my
roof except the westies have braces welded underneath. so it appears. it
doesnt look like i need to do some job like cutting the whole roof off, and
transplanting roofs. alot of it seems to be about the bracing. so if i get
myself a junked bus i should be able to transplant the braces fine. another
question. did all westies (70's years) have a sliding roof panel to cover up
the hole? unfortunately i didnt make a deal on any of the three westies i
saw becuase the busses all had cars stacked on top crunchinh the nice
fibreglass top (DUH!) and another question... (sorry) westies all had cots
for sleeping up above? looking at the photos of my bentley service manual
'68-'79 (page 40, chapter 1, body and frame) it doesnt appear more than one
normal size adult can sleep up there. am i wrong? heck i'm only 5'10, 150lbs
and it looks more cramped than my cramped 2 person R.E.I. tent!

does anyone sell the rubber weatherstrip that goes inside around the
louvered jalousie windows? i cant find it anywhere.

lastly, let me thank anyone who responds to any of the questions!

best regards, dave
