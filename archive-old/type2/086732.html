Subject: Engine won't start - ideas?

   Okay, the quick and dirty on this:

   Few months ago the bus was sputtering and giving me lots of trouble, it
also was having problems starting.  It finally got so bad that it would
barely run, and I limped it home backfiring and sputtering.  I decided it
may be the charging system (starting trouble and perhaps low ignition
voltage) and upgraded to a Bosche alternator.  When putting the motor back
in, I found that the starter had dropped a bolt and was hanging down some,
which I think really was the cause of my starting trouble.  After getting
the system back together, it still would not run.  I replaced the coil, the
plugs, the wires, the cap and rotor, and even the points and condenser.
Still wouldn't start.  Replaced the fuel pump because the pressure was
really low (wouldn't really shoot fuel out).  Did a compression test and got
between 90 and 95 on all of the cylinders. Now, the motor will turn over and
over and over like it should...  it just won't attempt to fire.  I can get
the smell of fuel out of the exhaust when I pump the pedal a lot.  It won't
really pull much fuel into the filter though.  I tried squirting carb
cleaner straight down the solex, and still would not fire.  I started
checking out the valves, and here is what happens:  the motor will turn
nicely by hand until it gets to within 5 or so degrees of TDC... and then I
can't turn it no matter how much force I put on it.  The starter can turn it
over just fine though. The engine still will not run.

For those not checking the signature, it is a '70 single port stock motor.
I don't have a lot of history on it, just drove it for about 2 months before
this happened.  I am going to go buy a Bentley for this van...  but I'd
appreciate some indications on where I should start.  Is the compression low
enough that I should just start a rebuild?  I'm really working on a budget
here if that helps decide direction.

Thanks as always!
