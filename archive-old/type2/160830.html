Subject: Re: [T2] fuel injection systems

Richard,

Replace the missing battery tray with a new one. Hot air will be drawn
into your cool air-stream without it and you will run hot. As for the
fuel lines there's plenty of pictures of burnt out buses out there,
its a good idea to replace ALL questionable fuel lines. You'll
probably need to drop and clean your tank out, or stock up on fuel
filters as you'll be replacing them often if you don't (ask me how I
know). Sorry I can't offer any suggestions on FI I'm running a carbed
1600.

Good luck!

peace

&gt;  also my battery tray is rusted completely
&gt; though.  there is no tray there at all actually.  should i try and use the
&gt; other side of the bus where the second battery would have gone or should i
&gt; put it somewhere else.
&gt;        i just changed the fuel filter and when i removed the filter, fuel
&gt; only flowed from the engine side of the filter.   the filter was very, very
&gt; clogged.  should i assume that the fuel line from the tank is the same.
&gt; should i just replace the line or try and clean the tank then replace, or
&gt; clean the line.
