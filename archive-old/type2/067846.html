Subject: Source for 12V lighting fixtures/accessories?

&gt;If anyone knows of a great place to get (likely mailorder)
&gt;12V lighting fixtures and 12V accessories, I'd appreciate the
&gt;info.

Markus:

Look in your local MEGA MONSTER hardware store for 12vdc
halogen lights.  They are usually used for undercabinet lighting in
kitchens.  Mine came with 20w bulbs, but I replaced a couple with
the 10w ones.  They even come with a transformer for running off
110vac--good for when your bus is plugged in somewhere.  All the
12v fixtures I've ever seen in boating or RV places look hunky and
junky in comparison--and were usually much more expensive.

....be on the road in no time.
