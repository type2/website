Importance: Normal

Motor is '68-'72
Mechanism is '69-'72 for sure but other parts will work from different
years. OK here goes, The rack or part that the motor mounts to never changed
'68-'79. The spindle change '68 only then '69-'72 than again '73-'79. The
wiper arms changed the same as well the nuts that mount them. The rest I am
pretty sure is the same. Keep in mind that you can use a complete set up
from any year bus. The '73-'79 is the most popular. We sell used complete
racks for $65 and motors for $75. We also sell every little part and piece
for every year bus. Feel free to contact me if you have any further
questions about our parts. Thanks.

71 wiper motor and associated mechanism.

Does anyone know what years will  work? Is it a 68-71 part?
