&gt; &gt; If there is a pan that covers the
&gt; &gt; entire undercarriage, I've never seen it.  Both of my buses are
&gt; &gt; pretty intact stock, and neither of them have any pan that even
&gt; &gt; remotely runs the length of the vehicle and covers the beams and
&gt; &gt; crossmembers and such.... or maybe I am not understanding what a
&gt; &gt; belly pan is.
&gt;
This was discussed a year or so back on this list...

From the best I can recall, sunroof buses had these belly pans installed.
Maybe even Westy's (can't remember)  I know my 65 deluxe with sunroof has
one.

Hope this helps..

Peace,
Snoopy
