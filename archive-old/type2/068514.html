Subject: horn saved me today

yes, funny isn't it?

I was driving along a residential street today, having just left work,   when
this guy was backing out of his driveway,  right in front of me!!!!!!!   I
stepped on the brakes and leaned on the horn.   He stopped, very close to the
front of my VW.  Without the horn, we would have collided.

Horns are good

PS           ALWAYS look behind you when you back up.
