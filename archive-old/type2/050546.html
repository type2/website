Subject: [T2] Type2 Tow Bar

I got several responses and wanted to get this into the archive. 
Firstly, the AZ tow bar is from:

Joe Nodzak
9223 N. 12th Ave.
Phoenix, AZ  85021-3018
602.997.7345  (fax 602.993.4368)
allbugphx_at_aol_dot_com
[VW Trends 10/2000, pg. 24]

Secondly, I was warned by a few folks that this tow bar is made from 2&quot;
tube and has only one cross-member.  Measuring at about 6 feet long, it
is subjected to too much torque while going around turns and twists up
like a pretzle.  Not good.  I'm thinking I'll have one made from angle
iron, with more cross members and attach it to the torsion tube in much
the same way as Joe's does.
