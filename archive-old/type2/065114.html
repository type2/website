&gt; OK, OK, admittedly its a Type III not a Type II, but I'll take what I
&gt; can get.  On TV last night started a 4 show series on our Public
&gt; Broadcast System, a new 'Mystery!' series, Oliver's Travels.  It
&gt; concerns a professor of comparitive religions, who is also into
&gt; anagrams, who is made 'redundant' and hits the road.  He hits the road
&gt; in an early 70's Squareback (very good shape, though I think I
&gt; detect a muffler leak).  Oliver is a very quirky, sometimes silly,
&gt; definitely different character.  Hmm, does this have anything to do
&gt; with him driving a VW, or is it the other way around?  This British
&gt; series was just brought to the US.  Have you UKer's seen it already?
&gt; The opening scene had a Vanagon, I think, in the background.
&gt; Lots of scenes of the Squareback in various settings.  Fun show, even
&gt; if it didn't have a VW in it.  My wife couldn't believe I spotted it
&gt; in the brief intial trailer for it.  The hostess, Diana Rigg,
&gt; introduces the show from a set that includes a stylized drawing of
&gt; the Squareback also.

I seem to remember seeing the start of one of the &quot;Revenge of the Nerds&quot; movies on TV 
and it had an orange Thing in very good shape pulling a large trailer down the 
highway.
