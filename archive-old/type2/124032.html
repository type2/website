Subject: Re: [T2] 1 bumper bolt cap left in the US

From: &quot;Dave Rogge II&quot; &lt;tgtsfkncld_at_att_dot_net&gt;
&gt; Does anyone have a picture of one of these?  I'd just like to know what
we're talking about here...

I don't have a picture, but they're a round button, about 1.25&quot; in diameter
and 0.375&quot; high that snap over the 4 bolt heads on the bumper.

I've got a few test casts on the bumper of my own bus, both out of a hard
resin and a softer, more flexible resin to test how well they work and wear.

I'm not exactly in a great business period, funds are low, so I'm unable to
pour the production mold for the buttons at this time.
