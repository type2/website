Subject: Re: [T2] Greetings and my first question...or two.

Another Hogan in northern Arizona! I guess you've heard that one before 
...

The first thing I would look at is the EGR valve and linkage. That's 
the cast iron thing on the plenum, opposite the throttle by connected 
to it by a rod.

As for the gas smell, you are right. It won't have anything to do with 
your specific performance problem. It is indeed probably a bad hose or, 
more likely, a bad filler elbow.
