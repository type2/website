Hi, everyone.

Thanks for helping me find a new engine for my '77 Westfalia.  Your common
sense was really valuable.

Now I have a type 4 1975 bus engine with low/no compression in #1 and #2
cylinders and one surplus transmission in good condition for sale.  Any
rebuilders in driving distance of Portland, OR may be interested.

$500  for both; will consider splitting up the set for $300 ea.
