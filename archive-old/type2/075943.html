Subject: Re: [T2] Breaking in an engine (really long :-)

First off, you need to break in the cam, lifters, and bearings. The VW cam
doesn't receive MUCH oil below 2000 since it's splash lubed off the
con-rods. So, that's why I recommend 2500 and up (I like 3500) for 15-20
minutes. Most other engines have better oiling of the cam/lifter area, and
they don't have the RPM window we need for this reason. Also, the engine
will NOT overheat, since you are simply reving it with no load; this is a
good thing because a new engine has tighter clearances than it will ever
have in it's lifetime (we hope), and clearances loosen a little as the
engine breaks in.

The second break in procedure after oil/filter change, is done to break in
the rings and cylinders. BTW, if you don't have a thermostat and operational
flaps, this is a SOB (if not impossible) in the winterttime. A hot engine
breaks the glaze on the cylinders and allows the parts to break in. So, this
is what I meant by LOAD the engine (it's been a while since I wrote that
article, but I don't particularly remember using the term LUG the engine) to
load the rings and break em' in.

&gt; &gt; Thanks for thorough comparison!  I didn't know about that article on the
&gt; &gt; t2 site so I'll go find it.  Also, I found an article on the
&gt; &gt; aircooled_dot_net site that says the engine should be run at 2500-4000 on
&gt; &gt; the initial run because 2000 rpms don't properly oil the cam.  hmm..
&gt; &gt; here's the link:

&gt; I think that there is more than one way to skin a cat.  Indeed, it looks
&gt; to me like no two cat-skinners do it the same exact way, and yet, simple
&gt; reliable beasts that they are, our engines suck it up and keep on pushing
&gt; the buses around.  I love these things!
