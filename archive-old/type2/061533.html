Subject: New German Heat Exchangers

I too, ordered the new heat exchangers from the Bus Depot. The have not arrived yet, but if the quality is anything like the German exhaust I recieved from them, they will be excellent. My question is this: Should these be installed as is, or should they be coated with something to extend their life?
This is my first message as I am a new subscriber. So far I just love the Type 2 list. Thanks.
