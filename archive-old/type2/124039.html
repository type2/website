Subject: RE: [T2] exhaust inside the bus

Over the weekend, When cutting up a bus for the scrapper I noticed on this
'71 you could see two &quot;bulges&quot; in the cargo section floor where the rear Y
comes over the rear axel, pin hole rust hear could be an issue,

Also have you &quot;tested&quot; for an exhaust leak??? I always do this by starting
the motor then get &quot;shop rag&quot; and stuff it in the tail pipe. if your motor
keeps running you have a leak!!!!! If your motor dies then your exhaust is
&quot;air tight&quot;... 

Just my thoughts

Good luck
