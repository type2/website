X-MailScanner: Found to be clean
Subject: Re: [T2] svda

Our SVDA is the best thing for the VW since sliced bread, but it sure won't
do squat to solve a rich idle, since the idle timing on a 009 an SVDA are
identical. Sounds like a carb problem to me.

&gt; I was reading an article posted on the web about bosch 009 distributors in
&gt; stock 1600. I am having problems getting a good idle and clean exhaust
smell.
&gt; According to the article it suggests either an original vacuum advance or
to
&gt; get an SVDA from aircooled.
