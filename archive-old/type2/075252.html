If you have mastered the maintenance of your type 4 then stick with it.

&gt; I know what i am asking has been asked many times before so i think
&gt; people should probably respond of list to keep repetition to a minimum.
&gt; I have a 78 westy and have had it for 5 years. I have decided that i
&gt; think i would prefer a standard bus (seems like they are the rarities at
&gt; shows now) Having only owned type 4 powered buses i am a bit spoiled, i
&gt; have only owned westies.
&gt; My debate is this;  would a type one powered bus be a better choice due
&gt; to cost and supply of type 1 engine parts or do the benefits of a nice
&gt; FI type 4 out weigh these costs.  I am also thinking in terms of labor
&gt; costs as i am personally much less threatened by doing repairs on a 1600
&gt; than type 4's partially.  Another thing that is quite clear to me is
&gt; that the supply of type 1 engine parts will long outlive that of type 4
&gt; parts and it is part of my dilemma.
&gt; What i am hoping for is to get a nice variety of opinions, polite ones
&gt; please :-),
&gt; to help sway me one way or another.
&gt; thanks in advance
&gt; Jamie
