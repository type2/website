Bill:

Thanks for your explantation regarding PLFVW.  Your situation certainly
appears to warrant the frustrations you've expressed.  I hope this all can
be resolved with some time, patience and communication, all difficult
commodities when it comes to business.  A reputation as a quality supplier
is probably a lot easier to lose than it is to gain, and may have nothing
to do with the quality of the product produced.  This is particularly true
with the limited potential customer base the bus community offers.  Whether
good or bad, a reality of our consumer society is that business often
leaves little room for personal problems.


Hopefully PLFVW can resolve supply and other problems confronting them.
Suppliers of quality and sometimes esoteric bits and pieces for our busses
are in short supply and my experiences put PLFWV in this category.  It
would be a loss for all of us to lose a supplier that genuinely shares our
enthusiasm for our busses and one who has demonstrated willingnes to
produce quality parts that few others are interested in making.
