&gt; Esteemed List,
&gt;
&gt; .............._dot_can I find steel fuel line?  Now I know that non-VW auto parts
&gt; stores sell small segments of fuel line which has been set up with flares and
&gt; hardware.  But what I'm looking for is regular old steel fuel tubing.  About
&gt; six uninterrupted feet of it.  Absolutely nobody I've talked to (including
&gt; pipe and tubing suppliers!) has the slightest idea of where to pick up an
&gt; item like this.  This stuff can't be extinct, can it?
&gt;

bookwus (what kinda name is that?)
A good FLAPS should carry inch sizes of Bundyflex, tin coated, rolled steel
tubing. 3/16&quot; is common brake line size, 1/4&quot; does fuel lines and some brakes,
5/16&quot; and 3/8&quot; fuel lines and cooler lines. VW use the 3/16&quot; for brake lines. I
don't know if they use inch sizes for fuel lines or if it will work. If not, here
is a place (drum roll please!) where your friendly VW dealer can help. It may be
in the back of the book, or the bottom of the fiche, but somewhere  they have
bolts and other hardware  that have numbers that start with N, (like N90305201, a
2.1 waterboxer connector hose for the intake runners), I think that's where fuel
line is. Good friendly local independent VW parts stores can also get true German
hardware from distributors like Wurth. For brake lines, I get the 50 foot roll,
lets you replace the long front to back one in a type 2 all in one piece. Just
unroll up by the front beam and thread it through, flare in place (double flare).
Not as easy as I've made it sound, but definitely doable.
