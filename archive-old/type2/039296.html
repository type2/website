Subject: Re: capacity

I don't remember where I heard this, but someone said that all US autos
were designed to have gas tanks that would take the car 300 miles.
So, if that's true, then 300 divided by 15.9 gallons gives you 18.87 MPG.
Of course this is NOT a US car :-}, but it does make sense.

&gt; I am getting 18.54 MPG on my 70 Westy which has a very well maintained
&gt; engine.
&gt; 5.39 gallons gets me 100 miles down the road.
&gt; This is a consumption number for a mixed bag of city and highway driving.
&gt;
&gt; Highway cruising is at 55-60 MPH, and city driving at a very safe
&gt; acceleration rate way over in the slow lane with my eyes continuously
&gt; scanning for death ray emissions from those great American land pig SUV
&gt; things out there on the tarmac driven with a lipstick wand in one hand
&gt; and a cell phone in the other.
