Subject: Re: [T2] wiring a trailer to the bus!!!!??
  (*)&amp;*&amp;)*(&amp;)(*&amp;)(*&amp;)*&amp;^%%$&amp;$#^%$#^^)(**+)_(

ok so i dont have it.... %$%$&amp;^%$&amp;%$#&amp;^%$% man i am making up some words out there...

the trailer lights i have;;;;;;;; only have two wires a piece a black wire and a red wire... so thats foru wires for both lights together.... two each////

both of these wires are suppose to work for turn signals and brake/running lights all in one....

i have no knowledge where to hook the wires and the directions arent helping at all....being this is a vw bus this is being applied to...that wasnt taken into consideration ?????????????

the red wires from the trailer lights hooks to which wire on the plug?

i thought it was suppose to hook into the brown wire?

so i hoooked both red wires from the trailer to the brown wire on the plug....

now for the black wires...?

well got a yellow and a green left on the plug and one is one turn signal and one is the other...

so i hook them up and i get no running lights or turn signals on the trailer...

now where does the ground attach to?

just ground to trailer...?

i have the other end of the white wire(ground) attached to a ground inside the bus engine bay area....

i am almost there but something isnt right even with this adapter....?

 

Please Help this is holding me up from getting things done.. damn it was not suppose to be difficult,... or am i just makign it that aways ??

 

i can hook the black wires form the trailer to the ground and then the red wire to the brown wire and get running lights but not sure about brakes dont have a helper right now in the sunlight to check for me while mashing them down...?

 

thanks for all those that can offer assistance..

chris
