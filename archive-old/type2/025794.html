&gt; Hey Folks,
&gt; &lt;Sigh&gt; Is nothing easy? I've encountered this on every VW I've ever owned,
&gt; but always managed to break them free. Heeding the advice I got over the
&gt; weekend to adjust my rear brakes, I did the right rear and all went well.
&gt; Left side, no go. The star adjusters appear to have become one with the piece
&gt; they fit into. I have tried: Liquid Wrench, heat, and vice grips-they still
&gt; won't budge. It also appears to have been this way for some time, as the
&gt; shoes on this side show almost no wear, as they are turned almost all the way
&gt; in. Any suggestions on how to get these $#_at_&amp;!  things unstuck? TIA,      Jeff
&gt; S. 

Yeah, but it's a pain in the ass.

Start by removing the brake drum, then the shoes, then the star adjusters.
Clamp them in a vise and, using a big-ass pair of vise grips, crank on them
until you get the screws broke free. When reassembling, just dip the end of
the screw into a little axle grease (get about a thread into the grease,
don't coat the whole screw) and screw them in and out a few times. Put a
touch of grease on the outside of the adjuster for easier movement.

Or remove the old ones, throw 'em as far as you can, and put in new ones,
greased of course.
