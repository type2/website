Subject: RE: Model name for 71 bus w/large mid sunroof 

hi diana - there is one such bus near my neighborhood. white, 1971, hatch
in the roof with canvas - not a full on pop top. has clean rear facing
seat. no sink, stove nor fridge. 2-seater bench and cabinet in the rear
cargo. needs repair under the windshield; and, the sliding door oddly
enough has bad ass rust under the SLIDER window. sliders on both sides!
interior is sharp. no cuts in the dash nor door panels. has an underdash
pioneer stereo. no major dents though a slight cosmetic ding at the left
front turn signal. an old sign laying on the rear hatch cushion said for
sale $2000, but the nearly bald tires are low, and it needs ALL the
exterior rubber seals replaced! customary teeny weeny oil drip prolly when
running. it is beginning to look sadder each day. without seeing the
engine, perhaps i'd offer a thousand. i'd go for the junkyard slider door
replacement. it is in eugene, oregon. if you're serious, i could further
investigate, or i have a phone number memorized.   -  steve
&gt;
&gt;I am attempting to find a 71 bus with the large mid section sunroof and a
&gt;pullout bed with cabinets. I owned one 20 years ago and now want to start
&gt;living my youth all over again. Could any one help me understand which
&gt;model bus I am looking for. This was not a pop top and did not have a sink
&gt;or a fridge.Just the rear pull out seat and westy vanity closet.  Any help
&gt;on model name or location of one in good condition would be greatly
&gt;appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;Thank you to all
&gt;
&gt;Dana
