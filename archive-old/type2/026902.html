Subject: Poor perfomance, '78 Transporter, 2.0 FI

Hello All!
Recently I purchased a part going from the throttle valve housing to the EGR 
Valve lever on my engine. It had been missing since purchase. First it had 
run fairly well, but in recent days, has been running weaker than usual. Did 
not adjust this part upon receipt, only installed it. Any ideas????  TIA for 
input.
