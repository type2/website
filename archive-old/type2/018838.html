It's Friday...

Three orders is not a statistical universe, but...

All three placed via the website.  Received e-mail acknowledgement later
that same day for each.  Each arrived in 4 days.  Each complete (except
Hoover's Sermons CD which was BO, shipped separately and took about two
weeks), correct, undamaged.

Too often we don't acknowledge good service; instead we complain about poor
service (I do it too).  Thanks Ron and the rest o'the gang!!

72 bus, &quot;Maureen&quot;
