Subject: need help with the front of my 78

Ok, so I got in an accident about half a year ago and dented in the 
front pretty badly.  My mechanic helped pull it out and did some bondo 
work, however, it's leaking and I'm not completely thrilled with the 
repair as it's still kinda pushed in and I'd really like a straighter 
front end.

So, I'm thinking of cutting off the front and putting on a new (better) 
panel.  I wanted to find out what other people think about doing this 
and how hard of a project it is.  Do I have to remove all the dash and 
steering wheel and electrical?  My friend has a bunch of tools and a 
welder and we're pretty descent at welding and wouldn't mind chopping 
off the front of the bus.

The other thing I'm trying to figure out is how to go about getting the 
front panel.  I can buy it new for about 150 bux and then it'll probably 
be another 100 bux or so to ship (guessing).  Or, does anyone have one 
out in the Los Angeles area?  I guess I could also make some visits to 
the junkyard to see what I can find...

Also, I noticed that the new ones don't seem to have the fresh air box 
attached to them... at least I can't tell from the pictures on the 
sites.  Is that part welded on?


It's a lot of questions, but I'm kinda frustrated with this whole thing 
and don't really know what to do.

Thanks,
Mike
