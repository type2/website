Joe, 
Al has generated a new thought process.
If you are looking for an inexpensive paint,I also would be looking for
off-tints at an automotive paint store.
Or---------PPG has a relatively new line of reasonably cheap automotive
acrylic enamel, that goes by the name of &quot;Omni&quot;.
It can be used with or without hardener, and goes on real nice, sets up
fast, and is pretty durable.
I  have been using it to paint dump bodies on trucks, where the paint
usually gets pretty beat up, and the quality doesn't make much
difference, on how long it lasts.
It lasts as long as the best (Imron) in this situation, and is about
1/10th the price.
The advantage to this stuff is, at least you could have it color matched
to your vehicle, and it will give you some durability, if you use the
hardener it will give you uv protection, it will dry without acting like
fly-paper, and in the world of paint is pretty inexpensive.

Check it out.

Later,
