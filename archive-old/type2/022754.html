For those of you worried about the load range of your tires, there is also a tire with a &quot;D&quot; load range available from Tire Rack. it is the Bridgestone 603V (might be 630V, cant remember).  Size is LT185/80 R14.  We put them on a '74 Westy &amp; they performed great.  Unfortunately that bus was sold just a couple of months later, so I have no report on treadwear. Anyway, bought these tires for about 80 bucks each and they were delivered to my doorstep in less than 4 days.
