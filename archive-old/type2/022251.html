&gt;    In my campground this morning I saw a camper called a Rialto, and it
&gt;had a VW emblem on it -- is this a Eurovan converted by somebody or all
&gt;VW or what? Any idea of price?

It is actually named a Rialta.  This is a Winnebago RV based on a Eurovan 
front chassis.  We have been looking at these and they are quite 
fabulous.  Price is a shade under $60K US with the normal things.  You can 
get more detailed information on Winnebago's web site.  The URL for the 
Rialta is http://www.winnebagoind_dot_com/rialta.htm
