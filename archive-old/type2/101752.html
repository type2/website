Subject: Pancake Virgin

I have been working on T1 engines for a while now. I just got my first bus with a pancake engine in it, a 72 Deluxe with a 1700 dual carb. How in the hell do you get to the spark plugs without taking off tin? While checking compression I dropped both rear most plugs (#2 &amp; #4) and can't friggin get to them, they are inside the tin!
BTW, compression was #1=60, #2 =60, #3=70, #4=95. ARe readings this low cause enough for the engine NOT to start. 
Also, I found that place on one of the carbs where the idle shutoff solenoid screws in is stripped, causing the shut off not to tighten down.  Will this keep the engine from starting?
Thansk &amp; PEACE! John Baker

Peace, John Baker
