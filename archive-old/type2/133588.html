Subject: Re: [T2] Power Bleeder

Dave

i would suggest that you go with one of the better mighty-vac bleeders.  i
stay away from shops that use power bleeders.  most power bleeders and pot
style bleeders use compressed air and that forces moisture and
contamination into the fluid.  not to mention that when dealing with shops
they like to leave fluid in the bleeding pot which lets it soak up ambient
moisture.  i know you are talking about using a garden sprayer but i would
still suggest the might-vac.  its relatively cheap and its a tool that you
can use for vacuum trouble shooting too.  it also a tool that can be used
on any of your other cars.

all that said i helped my brother build a system similar to what you are
talking about.  we used compressed air and a regulator to bring the
pressure down.  it worked pretty good. the down side is that you have to
keep taking it apart to fill the system with fresh fluid.
