I'm not going to jump in the fray on the &quot;Muir Bashing&quot; thread on the Type2 list. I've been around too long to get suckered into that, even on a Friday.

I will toss out some useful nuggets for all though. A couple months ago I contacted Eve Muir and got permission to publish excerpts from the Muir Engine sounds tape on the web. A few of these are now at:

www.volks_dot_net/muir/index.htm

This is just a sampling, with many more to come.

DO NOT COPY THESE SOUNDS to other sites! They are copyrighted material and I have written permission to use them! 

If you wish to link to the sounds on the sight, please link to the page referenced above or to www.volks_dot_net/index.htm. Eve has republished &quot;The Velvet Monkey Wrench&quot; in a 25th anniversary edition and I agreed to provide info about that book on my site. It would be unfair to link to individual sounds and circumvent the meager publicity she will recieve.

Once the VW Vendor's List has been updated to a database-driven resource, I'll be moving that to volks_dot_net as well. It's currently at www.coolurl_dot_com. I'm busy working on my bus lately, so no promises on when that will be updated.

The sounds were originally in a mono format and you'll hear a little static here and there. 

If you have any problems, comments, or suggestions, I'd appreciate them. Also, I have started collecting sounds from listees (well one, at least). If you have any interesting VW sounds that you'd like to share, I'll be happy to host them.

Thanks! Joe
