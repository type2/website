I have one, not powerful enough and you would probably do as well with a
&quot;Super shooter&quot; water pistol.

if you've blown em out with  air from both ends I can't imagine anything
being left in there. if you are REALLY paranoid about it get a fibre optic
viewing device and thread it thru the passages, but at this point you will
probably do more damage than you are likely to find.

good luck
