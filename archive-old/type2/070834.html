Subject: shifter grommet question
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Please forgive me, I wasn't able to get to the Vanagon site.
I have a 71 Westy that ya'll probably know by now, but the question at hand 
is about my friends Vanagon Syncro, 87 I think. Well the plastic piece that 
surrounds the stick shift is cracked in 3 pieces and I was wondering if 
anyone knows how to replace it, looks like an easy job and I would like to 
know how to do it instead of guessing, but I don't want to buy a manual for 
her (she lives in CA and is selling it here in Albany, NY (wish I had 5,000 
buckaroos to spend on it...4 wheel drive, gold, AZ bus, nice bed, AC, etc.), 
but would like to have her have the joy of shifting with ease while she's 
tasking a vacation in it for a few weeks, right now it's a bear to get into 
first and you can literally lift the stick shift out of the hole. Is it as 
easy as just taking the old grommet out and popping in a new one?
    TIA
