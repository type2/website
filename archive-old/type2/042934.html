&gt; Bucket, I Truly hope you are kidding.

&gt; Please tell me you were kidding in your previous post. This is clearly listed
&gt; in the instructions that come with the Universal CDI.

It did NOT look to me  like he was kidding. It was taken as a serious post and
not knowing the system, the advice looked suspect to me. My first thought was,
ok, now he made the system BO by doing the swap, but it still runs...  Also, not
knowing the system, I did not comment back.  The message looked serious and did
not have any simley faces or other wise to show that the writer was just kidding.

Jim A. gave the best description of why the units squeal without going into
technical details that cause ones eyes to glaze over.

I guess Mark Hineline's quote is ever so true...
    Today's guru was yesterday's &quot;Can I drive on two cylinders?&quot; poster.
