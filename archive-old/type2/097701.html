Subject: airtight engine compartment?

Volks-

I went out to my '78 Westy today and was poking around at the engine when I 
discovered that I have &quot;lost&quot; much of the material around the engine that 
seals the engine comparment from the elements, etc. This stuff is like some 
type of foam, and its all disintigrating when I touch it. Is there a 
replacement sold or should I try to stuff something else in there?
