Words can't express how excited I was about EB. Over the winter, I had been
making changes to my 1600DP in order to get a little more power and this
would be the first chance I had to see how everything worked on a long road
trip. So, with that in mind, I left Thursday, about 5:00, heading out US52
toward W.VA. The weather couldn't have been more perfect. I was headed east
with the sun at my back and a 4/2 lane road running along the Ohio river. It
was picture perfect as I passed tranquil farm scenes and small towns. Time
to get back in touch with myself and my bus.

About 1/2 hr. into the trip I noticed that I was running a little hot.
Stopped and found a heater hose had come loose from the fan shroud. Since I
had been playing with my timing, I also re-timed my engine. Everything was
fine after that.

Hit the turn-off for W. Va. and made it as far as Bickley, W. Va. Got a room
at a cheap motel (to lazy to stop and make my bed) and passed out. Woke up
at about 7:00 and was on the road again. Bus was running great and I only
had to use 3 gear once going thru the mountains. Hit Greensboro, got some
supplies, and arrived at EB about 12:30.

Pulled in, said Hi to Chris (thanks to Chris and group for putting on one of
the best events I have ever been to), and set up camp. Hung out the rest of
the day, saying hello to all of the people I knew and meeting those I didn't
know. Watched buses pull in one after another and they just kept coming, and
coming, and coming.  Met up with Mark Dearing and Bill ? of Salem Imports,
Salem, Va. and we set up camp along with Cap't America in his American flag
bus. The rest of Fri. night was spent in BS'ing and eating cherries. Passed
out about 12:30.

When I woke up Sat. I was amazed at the amount of buses that were there and
that I hadn't seen on Fri. Spent most of Sat. morning  socializing with
people I knew from the list and friends I had met previously. I can't name
everyone, so this is a group THANK YOU to all who showed up to make this a
great event. Sat. afternoon I took a field trip with Kelly Brown (had a
great time riding thru the countryside in his thing- thanks Kelly) and then
got back in time for the Chili contest. I was one of the judges and it was a
real,REAL,tough decision. After judging, I was too full to eat much else, so
more BS'ing and relaxing until the &quot;award and door prize&quot; ceremony. Sat.
night was spent in hanging out, BS'ing, and eating cherries.

Got up Sun. morning, packed up, said my good-byes,(sorry for anyone I
missed) and was on my way to the Farmington show. Spent a couple of hours at
the swap meet, saw a lot of friends that were not at EB but were at the
show. About 12:00, headed out for home.

The trip home was beautiful and relaxing. Bus was running great and I only
had to use 3rd. gear once going thru the mountains because I got behind an
18 wheeler who was going 35mph. Other than that I was home 9 hrs. later.

I have been to 2 EB events. One was all rain and one was perfect weather. It
made no difference- both were a GREAT time. To one and all, if it is at all
possible to make it next year- GO. You won't regret it. TBear
