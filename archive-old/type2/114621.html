&gt;Anyone know where I can find a new felt sealing washer and the metal
&gt;ring that centers in in the flywheel for a type IV (2.0L). The Vanagon
&gt;part number is 021-105-311.
&gt;Again Bus Depot cannot supply these (my
&gt;order was canceled).

I've been having getting these small engine parts from BD also.

&gt;I am not sure if it is similar to the 1600 engines,
&gt;whose parts number is 111-105-311. I do not think either number includes
&gt;the metal ring that centers the felt washer. Any idea where to find one
&gt;of these?

Does the felt ring come with replacement pilot bearings? Can anyone confirm this?

I've been looking for the metal washer with 5 holes, 021-105-275. The only places I've found are the online porsche vendors and Porsche dealer.
