Subject: Cylinder barrel temperature

Anyone know what range of temperatures the cylinder sleeves themselves are subjected to (not head temp)?  Or would cylinder temps be basically the same as head temp?  Looking for the upper end of a range to test a theory, that is can I repair a cracked cooling fin with hi temp epoxy.

Thanks,

Charles
