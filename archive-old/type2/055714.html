	Whoops... I transmogrified an unconventional sense of humor into an
elitist attack on non-stock-tent-bearing-VWbusdrivers... yikes! Well,
that's the truth. The lie was going to be about my evil twin brother,
Nasoj, who got online and defamed my good reputation with an attitude
problem... but I don't have the time to fabricate that right now.
	I'm mulling over my tent options... mine came with my '65, and has a
bad case of rot on one side, similar to the bus, but worse. If I can get
the awning fabric I'll sew a new one, with new fringe as well...
	Please accept my fervent apology for the previous tirade and flaming.
And, er, enjoy the ribs.
