&gt; &gt;I don't know any more.  For years I have run on the advice of 
various

&gt; &gt;that a T1 case could sustain without running hot was 28 degrees 
BTDC and
&gt; &gt;that the maximum that the T4 case could stand was 34 degrees BTDC.
&gt; 
&gt; As an aside, ever wonder why the huge difference in those numbers?  
What is 
&gt; fundamentally different about the typeIV that allows so much more 
total 
&gt; advance?

Probably something about 25+ years of intake and combustion design 
knowledge that allows the greater advance.  Also, larger pistons may 
require greater advance to allow the flame front to spread across the 
combustion chamber.
