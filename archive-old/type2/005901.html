When one of our cats became incontinent we used feline-specific neutralizers
from a pet store, but they were very expensive though effective.

We picked up a gallon jug of a product called &quot;ODO-BAN&quot;, and found we'd made
a terrific discovery.  This stuff works wonders on all kinds of odors, and
in most instances you can use it diluted at 4 or 5 to 1.  We've used it on
furniture, carpets, in stinky vehicles - you name it - and it always does
the job.

We found it at one of the warehouse stores, but I can't recall if it was
Sam's Club or COSTCO.

FWIW.....
