Subject: External poptop clamps, wind driving tips, long but worth reading

Buried at the bottom of a posting last week was the story of a driver
concerning having his poptop blow open from the wind over the Columbia
river in Portland Oregon.  He was going only 30 mph!!

Been there, done that.  I just drove that bridge four times and it was
really hairy the third pass, last Jan 29th.  I was going 60 mph and had
45 mph side winds there.  There's even worse winds when you are coming
down the grades between Yreka and Weed California in open windswept
plateaus, because the winds combine down-mountain gusts of cold dense
air in very intense bursts during storms.  Did I mention I was driving
in a storm front both times?
Going 75 mph downhill into rain-laden gusts of up to 50 mph wind can rip
your roof off.

This happens to be the way the traffic flows on I-5 in places, and I can
keep up with it, thanks to a counterweighted crank letting me avoid the
dreaded internal balance limitations of the vw firing order and stock
valvetrain, I'm good for 6500 rpm or so.  I run a cast PIS two-barrel
manifold with the holley-weber 5200 carb and a tuned header system,
currently a s &amp; s singlepack that had to have its backpressure increased
with a baffle for this carb tuning.  The whole longblock is stock, I run
the oldstyle internal cooler plus a currently bypassed full flow cooler
mounted on the inside under the intake air duct, this setup currently
has 350,000 miles on it with a full rebuild 15,000 miles ago, I'm
getting 50K on heads and 150K+ on my bearings, it's the same crank, same
carb, and oil pump all 350 K miles since I put together this motor in
1974.

(What is 85 mph with my gear ratio, I do that from time to time.  The
top speed level, no headwind, is currently 73 mph, since I have under
7-1 compression now, but with some traffic to draft I do extended full
throttle crusing speeds of about 78 mph.  Give me downhill to catch up
to somebody and I will let it go 88mph indicated, 85 mph honest.  I
drove up racing a 2.5 litre 94 plymouth sundance that was accompanying
me and honest to god, I drove full throttle all 850 miles unless it was
downhill.  Driving like this gives me 18 mpg instead of the 23 I can get
at 65 mph.)

This bus was daily commuter for eight years on no-traffic fullspeed
freeway drives of 40 miles roundtrip every weekday and goes to colorado
and back once a year and up and down baja once.  Many many trips SF to
Seattle including towing trailers.

I drove back and forth from San Francisco to Seattle, in mid December
and again last week.  I drove my 71 westy poptop, with the front roof
corners nicely clamped down using modified hood clamps with solid metal
threaded shafts instead of rubber straps.

I have been using these roof clamps since 1987.  These clamps are
externally mounted on the top windshield pillar corners and the front
corner edges of the poptop to help out the three internal rubber strap
clamps.

I want to point out this poptop configuration is limited to 1968 to 1971
or 1972 maybe, we have the luggage rack on the back, not the front.

While I considered mounting on the front end of the side and trying to
rig clamps to the raingutters, I decided I wanted the leading edge to be
held to avoid the distortion of that edge against the uplifting
headwinds that otherwise find a way under the front seal.  And anything
spanning out to the raingutters will also make some wind noise, right by
your ear.  While these clamps do require four small screws into your
body metal, they have been quiet and troublefree, and stay intact when
you release them to raise the roof.  I've had them so long I replaced
the first pieces already due to rust, and finished the next pieces with
&quot;endure&quot;.

The original center mount front roof catch is not adequate at all, since
you can lift the corners way up with the flexible roof under normal wind
conditions at speed.  At some point, the stock internal straps can't
hold it down and the roof either blows off, or blows halfway off, or
flips the bus, in some combination.

It was my experience the internal front catch mechanism is likely to not
work at all after a few years, being sprung out of shape by wind forces.

(I have seen a recall notice on recent vanagan and eurovan conversions
concerning the inadequacy of new vehicle pop-top retaining clamps, and
personally witnessed a horrific rollover accident in the nevada dessert
on highway 50 involving a new vanagon camper one summer.)

How to cure the problem once and for all:

Materials: 2 tie-down clamps, two three inch threaded eyelet bolts, two
wingnuts to fit the eyelet bolts, two washers, eight stainless bevel
head screws or use the screws in the clamp kits.

I started with what's sold as a jeep hood tie-down clamp (these are just
the same as what you see inside the early westphalia pop tops, but in
black rubber not grey).  They cost about $5.00 each and a common place
to find them is the &quot;help&quot; brand display in chain stores like Kragen and
Shuck's Auto.  (This area has stuff like manual choke cable linkages and
linkage springs, all intended for universal replacement use.)

You can also buy these for double that price, when sold specifically for
the inside clamp replacement on your early poptop.

Hey, just thought of this:  You buy some for the inside clamps and use
the rubber straps to replace your cracked inside straps;  Then use the
cracked straps for the new installation on your front edge corners,
reusing those junk straps!  You will we cut the straps and only use them
for a piece of rubber to bolt through.

The original rubber strap is on a metal pin, with a cotter pin on one
end.  You remove the rubber strap and refit with a threaded eyelet bolt.

First I covered the metal pin with fuel line hose, that makes it fit the
inside diameter of the eyelet end of the bolt.  Then I put spacers of
larger 3/8&quot; hose on each side to center it in the middle of the one inch
wide bracket where the rubber strap went.

You could just use the wingnut and washer on this to attach to the lower
clamp, but the lower clamp is intended to receive a round rubber bulb in
its socket.
If you have a little rubber ball to cut in half, you may do that, or
make the strap contribute this piece.

Cut up the strap to get a half-sphere of rubber (one side is flat and
the other trimmed into a sphere), drill a hole so you can bolt through
it, place a washer and wingnut below the rubber hemisphere.

I had to mount the base receptacles against the body metal at the upper
corners of the windshield pillars over a homemade rubber gasket (cut
from bike inner tube) with two sheet metal screws.   I mounted the
larger bracket with the threaded bolts directly onto the corners of the
pop top front.  There's already wood  blocking inside to thread into.

The end result is that you will have a rubber half sphere in the same
location as the rubber ball on the original strap, but it is removable
only by unthreading the wingnut on a threaded shaft passing thru it.

I found that I had to remove the original center metal catch mechanism
to get my roof to come all the way down and seal up well in the center,
I was unable to correct the problem although I removed it and tried to
bend it back into shape.

These two extra clamps on the outside front corners, plus the three
internal original rubber strap clamps (which I had to replace more than
once), gives me adequate clamping.  This roof can still lift the back
corners an inch or two under some very extreme side 60 mph wind
conditions, encountered mid-span on the San Rafael Bridge over the north
end of San Francisco Bay one afternoon, when a window facing the high
pressure was opened.  We were stopped there while a tipped over semi
trailer blocking the road was dragged to one side.

Since I've driven this bus through baja where they get 120 mph winds
during typhoons, I've thought about this stuff a bit.  The real problem
would be if the side jalousie windows caved in and the internal pressure
at that point might lift the roof enough to allow the wind to catch it
and rip it off from the rear.   The best thing would be to park it with
the nose into the wind and hope for the best.

Unless you are a storm chaser in tornado country, likely you don't need
to do all the inside clamps as well, which would be possible using this
same technique.

The driving down from seattle was done in a weather front that gave 50
mph winds over some of the passes at the OR/CA border, and constant
30-35 mph winds in heavy rain downpours for the first three hundred
miles.  I think that the
need for extra considerations driving a bus in these conditions makes
you a safer driver, since you have monstrous feedback through the
steering and in the seat of your pants concerning your traction and side
load.   I need to allow up to 4 foot drift-space in order to not
overcorrect and loose traction in the side gust forces when the roads
are really flooded.

The bus has to be modified to have enough power to manuver into the
safer spaces in the flow of traffic, crawling along and getting rear
ended is not preferred.  This means driving flat out into headwinds and
quarter-on wind, until you get into a draft pocket in the flow of
traffic, when there is any.  I personally enjoy the experience quite a
bit, but I see that others would simply never be comfortable driving a
bus under some wind/weather conditions.  You can get spoiled driving a
Chevy Suburban or some other tank, but you won't know what went wrong
when you do loose it from hydroplaning and side winds spin you out.

Bus wind driving tips:

If you drive over a bridge in really high winds, find the lee area that
is created by any guard rail or side barrier.  This means moving into
the fast lane if that's the side the wind comes from.

The wind will create a &quot;standing wave&quot; that goes higher than the guard
rail, and which gives some shelter in its lee.   The best position in a
45 mph side wind is likely eight feet to the leeward of the rail, and
you will experience the joy of being in a low-pressure tube, rocking
with turbulance but without much side force, blasting at full speed up
the bridge grade in the fast lane and passing swerving vehicles fighting
the wind over in the right where the wind wave is now tumbling onto
them.

In the same vein, the protection of a draft pocket behind leading
traffic can be found one lane over instead of behind the leading vehicle
in side winds, even two lanes over in some situations where you follow
at a safe distance in the rain with strong side winds.  If you can get
into a position of leeward shelter and keep up with the flow of traffic,
you will not be swerving as bad.
