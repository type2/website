&gt; If memory serves, oxy-acetylene burns at about 5,600 degrees. It works for

&gt; oxy-propane would negate this, I don't know.

Yep, I find a 000 tip worked well for this type of welding. With 
a bit of practice, you can get a smooth, even weld. Propane I had 
trouble getting hot enough... so the panels tended to warp. It does work 
for brazing the parts, though.
