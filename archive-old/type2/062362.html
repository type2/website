Subject: '76 Westy FS - Amarillo TX

Ad first posted in Amarillo Daily News, Friday, August 30, 1996:

76 VW camp van, sleep 4, 2000cc fuel, injected engine.  Great cond. 
$2395 obo (806) 374-8286


I went by to check this one out today.  The guy selling it (Kenny) says 
that it came from a collection of 50 old cars this eccentric Lubbock guy 
had.  This guy now has Alzheimer's and they had to build a tall fence, 
with barbed wire at the top, all around his estate to keep him from 
running off in his underwear.

The car *may* have 43,000 original miles.  Kenny says it hasn't been 
licensed since 1987.  It was originally school bus (baby sh*t) yellow, 
or &quot;Mango,&quot; as some prefer to call it.  Someone painted over the bottom 
half of the &quot;mango&quot; with cheap white paint.  I don't think they even 
bothered to remove the car wax first.

It has factory air conditioning, which probably needs vacuuming and 
recharging, but all the parts are there.

Kenny doesn't seem to know much about VWs, so I gave him some helpful 
hints, such as:

* Replace the engine seal (foam) immediately; this is like running your 
American car without coolant.  Apparently it hasn't been run very long 
without it.

* Set the valves, engine stone cold, to .006&quot;

* Set the timing, idle speed ~900 rpm, hoses connected to distributor, 
to 7.5 degrees BTDC.  He's running it about 12 or 15 degrees right now 
and it backfires a little.  He was also using #3 spark plug wire to set 
the timing.


The interior is fair, with some veneer peeling away from a couple of 
cabinet doors.  There's a sink and icebox.  The canvas is weakening and 
there're a couple of small tears in it.  The right rear tailight is 
cracked and there's a small dent underneath it.

There's a slight dent behind where the spare tire mounts on the front.

The battery tray is partially rusted out.  There's the usuual rust 
bubbles under the windshield.  The body is straight and generally 
rust-free otherwise.  It has all the curtains (mango).  The tires are 
fair.

I have a spare engine seal and some lenses, etc. if someone needs them 
for this bus.

I think he'll come down considerably on the price.
