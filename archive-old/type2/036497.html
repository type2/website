Greetings all,

I'm looking at having a stereo system installed in my '74 Westy.

There doesn't seem to be much to support the radio inside the dash.  I'm
almost positive that I'll be putting some 6x9's under the couch, but not
sure of where to put speakers in the front.  I'm not looking for super
volume or crazy bass, just pleasant quality sound that will overcome engine
and wind noise.

I appreciate your help and suggestions from people that have already done
this.

Thanks,

Darrin K. Pierce
