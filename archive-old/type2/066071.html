Hi Listees, 
I just returned from my favorite junkyard, not really my favorite but the
cheapest I have ever seen.  Normally they do not have buses there but I
salvaged a vanagon last month for parts.  It has been in my carport the
whole time consuming my life.  Well last night I finished stripping it out and
rolled it out onto the road for the junk yard to come and pick up. That was
fun with two independent front wheel.  (no steering or brakes).  Luckily
two neighbors came out and helped me as they want it out of there also. 
 I sure learned a lot about how the vanagons are built by tearing it all
apart. 

Today I was passing this junkyard and stopped in to tell them I was
finished with the old and they were welcome to come haul it away. 
Whole there I noticed a new line of VWs.  Three Vanagons, and one 70s
style bus (Not sure of the year).  These were all new since last month. 
Anyway to make the story short, of the four vehicles two had been
burned, one vanagon and  the bus.  I bet the bus. owner was heart
broken as it looked as if it had a good paint job.  It was toast, no pun
intended.  Both had been fairly well consumed.  SO IF YOU LOVE YOUR
BUS/VANAGON/WESTIE YA BETTER PROVE IT BY CHECKING AND
FIXING THOSE FUEL LINES.  nuff said.

BTW, the 70 bus still had some good items on the front.  ie chrome
around lights, parking light, etc.  I snagged a complete grill, an exterior
door handle (the vanagon one that likes to break off and costs about 85
bucks), and two hubcaps all for a whopping 20 bucks.  I feel good about
that.

Another note, one vanagon was filled with what I thought looked like old
bug parts: trans, bumper, lots of clean engine parts and who knows
what else.  I didn't have much time to see it all.

REMEMBER:  You have been warned!!!!!!!!  (more than once on this list)
have a great day!
