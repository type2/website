&gt;I really like the slider windows too, i have even acquired a set for my

These came on my '77 on both sides, and I love them. One of the PO's must 
have installed them since they didn't come into the picture until '78. My 
questions is, what is the part number for the seals for these? I am 
planning on stripping my bus to bare metal in the next year or so, and 
repainting, including replacing all seals, but I am not sure which seal to 
get for these windows.

Thanks,
Nick
