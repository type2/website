Subject: Firebus spotted

	Hi listees,

Have to report a special bus sighting. On my way home from work I saw a ´70
higroof panel van with bright red colour and all the other fire truck
accessories. It stood at a service station so I stopped and talked to the
guy who was filling it up. 
He said it belongs to the fire department in a small town not far from here
(Vasa Finland). He told me the bus was still in use but mainly as a reserve
vehicle when things got really busy. It had 100000 km on the odometer and
was in grate shape. The highroof was probably the work of some local
coachbuilder. The guy said it behaved like a sailboat on windy days but
othervice a nice driver.

Man, I want to be a fireman!!!!

Uffe
