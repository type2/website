&gt; &gt; the other way is to weld a nut on the end and use a socket,
&gt; &gt; then throw it away and get allen head bolts that fit, and use a proper
&gt; &gt; sized
&gt; &gt; METRIC allen wrench!!!!
&gt;
&gt; Wish I had the welding torch. These bolts have not seen a 6mm
&gt; hex wrench since the factory.

A 78 with hex head bolts? Are you sure they are not triple-square? [lots of
splines, not just 6]


&gt; The welding idea is a very good one though. Thanks for the tip.
&gt;
&gt; Tried the vise grips, maybe with a chewed up head I will have better
&gt; grip. They tended to slide right off.

Usually CHEAP vise grips slip off. I found out years ago that with vise
grips, you get what you pay for. I no longer buy any other than Vise Grip
brand. Even Craftsman are junk, but a lot better than the China/Taiwan crap.
Put the allen socket/wrench in the bolt head as deep and tight as you can.
Then put the vise grips on the head of the bolt and squeeze them as tight as
you can.
