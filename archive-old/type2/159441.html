Subject: Re: [T2] Good wipers?

I know the windshield needs a good deep cleaning, but what's the
&quot;claybar&quot; method?

I was going to use some stuff called soilove - it's a laundry spot
treatment, but it sure does melt nasty goo - cleans pipes well.  Have to
watch it on some vinyls, tho', so I'll be cleaning first then replacing
blades just in case.

I'll look for michelins and trico...  Looks like trico has a winter
teflon...  Tho' the link was to the innovisions.

And some rain-x.  I AM on the Oregon coast, after all.

Thanks, all!

Teri
