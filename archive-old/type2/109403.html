Subject: I've (still) Got the Oil Leak Blues...

I'm stumped (it doesn't take much). I've got a 1970 Westy, 1776, full flow
filter, hydro lifters. She's got an oil leak that's pretty bad, and I need
ideas. The leak seems to be coming from the front (front is front) of the
engine. Here's the kicker. My friend and I replaced the front main seal this
summer and it when we got the engine in, it was still leaking. I have next to
no clue what I'm doing but I trust that my buddy does (famous last words?). So
what else could be causing this leak?
    It's coming from between the engine and tranny. I can see the oil build up
before it drips and it's a little right of the case seam. My case seems pretty
crappy, but I've got a hunch that it's not coming from the seam
Muir says that an oil cooler leak will be on the left side, is this true or
could an oil cooler leak be the culprit? Pushrod tubes look clean and dry.
Would they be all dirty and oily if that's where the leak was?? Oh one more
thing, when we replaced the seal this summer, clutch was bone dry. My
understanding is that if that seal goes, you're replacing a clutch soon too.

Anyway, that's my predicament. Any help would be appreciated. I guess I could
get one of those stickers that says &quot;VW's don't leak oil, they mark their
spot&quot; and chalk it up to my bus's character, but I'd rather not:)
