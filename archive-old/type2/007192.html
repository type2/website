Corrobation here...
'78 = tranny hangers (engine out)
My spankin' new '69 Riviera = No hangers (Only by feeling around, I haven't
had the engine out yet)

Russell Barr
Centralia, Washington
'69 Riviera
'78 comatose bus
'77 organ donor sunroof

A Type2 list member is someone willing to crawl around under their bus,
getting goobered up with tranny mung, at the slightest provocation.

&gt; Moral: '68-71, no original rear trans support.  On US models at least
&gt; (can't speak for others).  '72-79, supports on bellhousing.  
&gt; 
&gt; Any corroborative evidence?
