&gt; Optima's are great.  More expensive, but worth the money.  You'll need
to get a starter battery (red top) and a deep cycle battery (yellow top).
They're about the same size as any other battery, so they'll fit fine.
If your charging system is working for the 2 batteries you have now,
it'll work with the 2 Optima's.  By the way, don't pay retail.  I just
bought a yellow top from a place in New Mexico called TNT Distributing.
$127, plus $16 shipping, $143 to my doorstep.  I can get you a phone
number if you can't find them on the web.

Let's see.  I pay about $40 for a Pep boys &quot;72-month&quot; Exide battery, which
lasts about 5 years and which can be refilled with water if needed.  Pep Boys
gives no hassles if I do a warranty return.

To get the same value, the Optima would have to last for 15 years.  A
listee (forget if it was the VB or T2 list) recently had an optima fail.
He had to wait while the battery was shipped back to Optima to be
&quot;evaluated&quot; and then had to pay a &quot;restocking fee&quot; to get a replacement
battery under the Optima warranty!  What a hassle!  Read the fine print!

Also, if your voltage regulator goes out and boils the electrolyte away,
you are out of luck with a sealed battery.  With the normal battery, you
pop the caps and put a little water in.

Think before you spend big bucks on an Optima.  They are a trick item,
good for high-vibration, unusual attitude applications, but a bus is
really neither of these.
