Subject: engine cooler

Hi,

When I was in India a few years back, many Hotels advertised &quot;Air Cooling&quot;.
This differed from air conditioning in that there was no compressor to
create a cold dispensing inverse radiator. Instead, it used a simple law of
physics. Evaporation is endothermic. The system had a water pump that
continually kept an air filter damp so that the air that went through it
absorbed energy and cooled the surface of the filter. It pumped water from a
basin under the filter through a hose to spray the filter so that it is
always moist. Just keep the reservoir full and you will always have cool
moist air coming out the other side. Blowing air through it you find a
noticeably cooler air coming out the other side. In addition, and an
important point for air cooled busses, the air that goes through the element
is humid, having picked up moisture from the filter. Moist air absorbs heat
better than dry air so when it circulates through the fins on the cylinders
it will transport more heat away.  I have often thought of mounting such a
system in front of the air circulation intake. It should be easy to find a
12 V pump and filter element. The only issue then is how to keep the
reservoir full. Luckilly I live in British Columbia, which is neither hot
nor dry. Thus I have never taken on the project.
