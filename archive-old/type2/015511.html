I'm sorry, Mike, but I repeat and elaborate. You have symptoms of poor
function. You are on an exponential curve to failure. Time spent
speculating on which of the several parts in there is the problem is wasted
time. The solution to your problem will not be known until to pull the
clutch and inspect the parts.

Then you can tell us what failed and you and the rest of us can try to
explain why you had the symptoms you had, and we will all know more.
