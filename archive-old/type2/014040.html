Subject: weeeeee!!

Finally!!!  Meine Rettung finally past state
inspection today.  No problems..for once.  I have the
stereo almost completely wired and the gauges just
need a power lead...oh, yeah...and I need to figure
out how to wire this fridge too.

Anyway, my hands are bruised and cut all over from 2
days of installing...and re-installing the new poptop
tent.  Damn thing came up too short.  I swear it fit
the first time, then it became late and I decided to
finish the project in the morning...I swear the sucker
must have shrunk overnight...anyway, the new beautiful
tent is in.

I just wanted to send out a big THANKS to everyone on
this list that has helped me get on the road!  From
items people have shipped me, to just words of
encouragment...you all have been awesome!

I have now been unemployed, er, self-employed for 2
weeks now.  This feels good.  Anyway, I'm writing a
book about a modern day roadtrip in a not so modern
vehicle...by beloved bus.  I'll be stopping at
ultimate tourneys on the way...and of course...disc
golf courses.

I'll be leaving in less than a week.  I plan on doing
a quick one week loop, just to be sure we aren't too
overloaded and have everything we need before we get
too far from homebase.  So, I will keep all of you
updated while on the road.  Hopefully, I won't have to
use the AIRS list, but if I do, I'm sure I'll find a
smiling face pulling up to me in a fine VW.

Thanks again everyone!!
