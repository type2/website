Subject: FW: [T2] More starter problems

Sounds likely,

Starters will burn out easily especially if they are old. Please be careful
trying to start your bus with a screwdriver under the bus. This is
dangerous, you could drive over yourself. You can pull the starter easily
and bench test it in a matter of minutes. We don't well parts for Vanagons
but MLI in Denver Probably does. 303-657-9690. These SR19X rebuilt starters
are not cheap (_at_$200.00). Good luck. Try whacking it with a wrench a little
that sometimes helps.

&gt; OK, I found the ground and attached it.  Now the
&gt; cylinoid clicks really hard but the starter motor
&gt; isn't doing anything.  When I try the screwdriver
&gt; method it clicks multiple times but the starter never
&gt; seems to engage and try to turn the engine.  Thinking
&gt; back, the starter worked when I pulled the engine but
&gt; the last two miles I was driving through the city with
&gt; the pilot bearing gone and had to start the bus in 1st
&gt; gear a couple of times before getting it home.  do I
&gt; have a blown starter motor?  I'm thinking I must of
&gt; killed it with those in gear starts.
