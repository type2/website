Subject: RE: JC Whitney FI guage, parts and front end rebuild

Check with JCW before you get all excited about the front sway bar.  The
one that fits the 81 Vgon is still in the catalog years after I was told 
that it is no longer available.

Not much in the JCW FI testing kit that you can't get at a good flaps.  I
especially would have appreciated an on-off valve in it.  As it is you
test your connections by turning on the fuel pump, and if the connections
aren't tight, you have to go have dinner while your gas-bathed engine
dries off.
