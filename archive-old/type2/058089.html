List,

I am going to the NFL opening season in Minneapolis this weekend and =
would like to pick up a pad for the back part of my 74 Westy that burned =
up in an engine fire that the PO endured.  Would also enjoy meeting any =
VW people along the way ... does anyone know of sources for used parts =
along the route between Cedar Rapids, IA and Minneapolis, MN???

Thanks

Mike
