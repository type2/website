Subject: Re: [T2] Starter bushing, any tricks??

Hello Guys   how in the hell oh never mind it don't matter don't worry about 
it what is it gonna do it's just brass. Now let me tell you the way to install 
one so that you don't drop it. Take a 3/8 scocket extension and a scocket 
that just fits the bushing, now use electric tape and tape them together, now as 
you drive the bushing in the tape will peal off the bushing and you will have 
a scocket with tape on it and the bushing in it's place Later and have fun
