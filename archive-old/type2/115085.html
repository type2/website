Subject: Parcel tray installation

List,

I have a pair of the VW accessory parcel trays for my '79 westy. These are
the ones with the rubber covered metal frame with mesh inside.

I am not sure on the installation of these. The drivers' side will not fit
around the fuse box, this I know. I have a plan for that side, but it
involves modifying the tray frame itself and re-making it.

The passenger side is going in, I have the original brackets, but I am not
sure where the brackets attach.

I was hoping someone could help with either good pictures of a set installed
(better than the one on the bus-boys website), a web link or similar. Or
another thing: I know bus boys make and sell repro parcel trays that come
with installation instructions, I wonder if these mount in the same way and
if anyone has these instruction they could scan and send me?
