Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Line Size, Please

For those with pre-75 &amp; carbed buses......

Be advised that non-FI buses use a lot less hose.... and I think that
approx. 2 feet of each type should be enough (5mm &amp; 7.5mm hose??).  Also
only 4 clamps are required instead of the 30 or so as per the FI system.

Thanks for the reminder to finish this project.  I've got the hose at home
and will tackle this job sometime in May.  I'll post the carbed hose
replacement article in the library when it's ready.

Regards,
Shawn.
