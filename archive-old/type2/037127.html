Subject: Carb Problems

Hello to All, 
Glad to be back on line.&gt;Few weeks ago some one had
&gt;an idler problem. I guess now is my time. I had a
&gt;voltage regulator going bad so I replaced. Then I
&gt;been having a problem with my right rear drum getting
&gt;loose and the  splines strip, so I fixed(is the
&gt;second one) what's up with that? Now is that with no
&gt;reason at all is not idling. I have a 1600 DP 009
&gt;pointless, new carb. Every thing is stock the only
&gt;thing it needs is another tune up. I been looking for
&gt;intake leaks and just about every thing else and I
&gt;haven't been able to find nothing wrong. Unless my
&gt;carb is out of setting.

(Update since I was off line too) I just adjust the
mixture and know ran in idle but whenever you step on
the gas try to choke. I don't know what else to do. 

&gt;It was working very good until I fix the regulator. I
&gt;have to actually advance the timing few degrees to
&gt;actually keep it from shut in off to drive it.(is my
&gt;daily driver) Any way if any one have any suggestions
&gt;please let me know. Thanks in advanced!
