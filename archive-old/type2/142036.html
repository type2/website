Subject: [T2] garage door height.. and torsion bars

The points (refs below) are worth considering.  My garage has a very high 
ceiling, so I thought about buying a 4-post storage lift -- prompted by an 
email from the manufacturer whose weekly emails announce big sales, alternating 
2 and 4 post types...  Before ordering, I went out to the garage and noticed 
the overhead door tracks would be a problem.  I might re-engineer the tracks 
and wrapped-spring counterweight system, or I could replace the doors with 
traditional hinged doors swinging outward.  So I had another cup of coffee and 
moved on to other opportunities of the day. 

Speaking of torsional counterweights...  my 1969 Bay is showing evidence of its 
engine weight, sagging noticeably in the rear.  Resisting jokes now... apart 
from an occasional weekend cruise, the old microbus has been mostly sitting for 
~25 years now.  I wonder if anyone of the Type 2 List has experience re-setting 
the rear torsion arms, including (possibly) pulling the torsion bars and 
interchanging left and right.  I know in the future it would be more sensible 
to put the vehicle up on jackstands when not in use... but right now I need to 
think about fixing the sag.  Thanks!  Glenn

Might you someday replace your Westy with a Dodge Sprinter or Eurovan 
Weekender? Better go measure them now... &lt;grin!&gt;

Just a word of warning, I have gone through the same process recently when 
buying my new garage. One big trap is a lot of manufacturers quote a door 
FRAME size, but the actual height you get once the door is installed is 
lower (and narrower), some up to 3&quot; lower than the frame (and 4&quot; narrower).
The one I bought has the door guides etc inside the frame so you get the 
full opening. I went over board and got a door 7'10&quot; high so I can load the 
roof rack in the garage :). Richard, Brisbane Australia
