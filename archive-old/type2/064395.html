Subject: Tranny fluid change. any hints on how to?

        Hi all; I have a 72 bus and am planning on changing the
 transmission fluid.  I know the book says just top it off but I figure
 that after 25 years and untold hundreds of thousands of miles it's about
 time.  My first question is: Are there any seals around the drain plug
 (like the oil drain) that I need to worry about?  Second, There is only
 one drain and one fill plug.  right?  I have only been able to find one of
 each but the manual keeps refering to the tranny and final drive as two
 seperate units eg:one takes x quarts of fluid, the other takes y quarts
 and so on.  If they do have seperate drains and fills, please let me know
 where they are. And finally, what size allen wrench do I need? that 
 sucker is huge!  Any additional hints are always welcome.
 thanks.
 Ed.
