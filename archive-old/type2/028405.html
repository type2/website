From Ron...

 You guys in
&gt; California/Nevada/Arizona junk busses that would fetch $2k just for body
&gt; condition alone here on the east coast, and that's no
&gt; exaggeration.There they end up in junkyards for mechanical reasons, here
due to rust-through.
[...]


I am sadly in Australia or I woud have just found a new job for myself. Van
trawling in the hot and dry and selling into the rust belt. And why not?
