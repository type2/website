Subject: Shipping a car

Was Written*****************************************
Have you checked into shipping it out there.  My dad
had a car shipped from Florida to Washington State
last year.  I don't remember the price 
but I remember being surprised that it was lower that
I expected.
*****************************************************

Regarding shipping a car...

I recently bought a Harly Davidson Motorcycle 
(95 Fat Boy)from a guy in Anchorage Alaska and had it
shipped down to me in Reno Nevada. When I started
calling around for prices I found that the prices
ranged from $2500 to down to an average of $1200...I
kept calling and finally found a major trucking
company (Reddway Express) that did the shipping to
Reno for $572!!!

Do your home work.
spending a couple of hours on the phone saved me big 
dollars$

Good luck
