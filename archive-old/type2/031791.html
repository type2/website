Subject: Re: [T2] clutch question

&gt; bearing were worn, but no catistrophic failures. The bolt holding the

&gt; of the 4 holes are elongated in both the flywheel and the crankshaft. My
&gt; question is can I put a new clutch, pressure plate, and throw out bearing in
&gt; and get maybe 300 more miles out of it? The reason for that is my garage is
&gt; full of building materials for a house project that I should be done with in
&gt; 4-6 weeks. Then the bus is going in the garage for restoration. Until then I
&gt; need to move it around to keep the city off my back.

well you could probably put the best dowel pin into the best set of holes
tighten the nut down very tight and drive it very VERY VERY gently you
could get lucky and get by..  but it is at best 50/50 but you probably
couldn't hurt the flywheel and crank any more than it is so what have you
got to lose
