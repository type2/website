We have a 77 Westy that has an ice box that we do one of two things.
Sometimes we put dry food and extra pop that we don't need on ice
yet.....other times, for short trips or for weekend camping, I take small
water bottles filled with drinking water then freeze them.  When we have the
camper packed and ready to go, I take them from the home freezer and put
them in the little fridge.  They stay frozen quite awhile and when they thaw
you have drinking water or water to wash  have coffee or tea etc.  Meanwhile
the bigger cooler holds the perishable food and extra ice.  Works for us.

&gt; &gt;&gt;  I have been thinking about the functionality of the Westy icebox unit
&gt; in the 68 to 73 campers. Please share you experiences and ideas for
&gt; making it work. What works best:dry ice, dry ice, frozen ziplock bags
&gt; of ice, use the ice box for dry storage :) ?
&gt;
&gt; BTW, many folks just remove theirs and perhaps for good reason but I
&gt; want to make a go of it.  &lt;&lt;
