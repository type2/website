&gt; Hi everybody,
&gt; Do any of you volks have information on the quality of repair panel parts
&gt; from Rocky Mount ion Motorworks.  I need a section of rain gutter and a few
&gt; other pieces.
&gt; 
I have bought some panel pieces for a bug from them, and have received
excellent quality.  For pieces they don't carry, or are too expensive, I
use 20 gage cold-rolled and hammer it into shape, welding down as I go.
