Hi Roy,

I have a Jacobs BugPak in my 74 Thing (1776cc engine). When I put it in
I did notice smoother running and a power increase (seat of the pants
testing). It uses your points as a switch for firing, lower current
through them.  It is a big blue square heat sink with the parts embedded
in it, about 5&quot; square. It has its own variable voltage coil in it, as
someone else replied it suppose to use the resistance of the plugs (if
you are using the Jacobs plug wires, which come with it) to vary the
spark, detect if the flame goes out and respark etc.

I paid $219 for it.  Although I like the unit, if it had been any more
expensive I'd have gone for the one Bob H talks about.  Couple of points
about Jacobs.  They usually don't list prices in the ads, when you call
them be prepared for the hard sell by the salesman/techs on the phone.

If you do order, make it very clear to them that they tell the guys
making up the plug wires how you want the rubber seals for the tin
oriented. They have a problem getting these right. If you look at the
picture in their catalog of the bugpak you see the seals on correctly,
so they can slide as close to the connector end as possible. They tend
to reverse them so they will slide as far away from the connector end
(maybe for the type 4's that have the spark plugs deeper into the tin).

The plug wires are slightly thicker, be careful if you try to push them
into the plug wire holders on the fan housing, you can damage the outer
covering (voice of experience)

They do warrenty the plug wires for life, I had the connector pull off
one and they just mail out another. This brings up another point, the
plug wires are assembled by them and the connectors are permanently
mounted. This is so they can test them and assure that they have the
correct low resistance to work with the bugpack.  The problem is what
happens when the rubber seals get brittle. You should ask them to put 2
or three of the seals on each wire, slide the others back out of the
way, then when the one by the plug is brittle just cut it off and slide
another up.

For the Thing a good mounting point is the bracket on the left side for
the auxilury air cleaner. I made a mounting out of angle iron and a flat
plate to mount just behind the bracket.

Hope this helps. I don't work for Jacobs, etc. etc.
