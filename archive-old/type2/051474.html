Aaron,
I have a 75 VW Riviera Camper in Ohio that once had motor home plates.  What I am about to say is only what I have been told by others, so it may be completely wrong!  But i heard that while the vehicle is on the road, it is as fair game as any other car, as far as searches and seizures go.  However, if the bus is parked and camping, there may be a few more restrictions for the fuzz as far as searches go.  However, experience has taught me that If the cops want to hassle you, they will find a way regardless...So anyway, I found it better to save myself the nearly $20 a year and just get passenger vehicle plates...
