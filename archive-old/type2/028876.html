Anyone have some hints when the new one refuses to go in? Have all but about
3 feet with push pull push pull. I am at a standstill and had to come back
to work for a while. I hate busses sometimes. I am desperately trying to get
this poor girl running before the High Country Bus Fest. New engine in, all
new fuel lines, fresh seals, then this. I do not even know if it will start.
