Subject: The pin that holds the handbrake handle on is hollow !

If I'd known this I would have replace my worn &amp; split handle with the nice new
one from Just Kampers in 10 minutes instead of an hour ! I only noticed this
when I removed all the rubber cover. So ignore the Haynes manual diagram - it's
not solid !

P.S. I know it's only a little thing but the bus seems nicer with the new
handle.
