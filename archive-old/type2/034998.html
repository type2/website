Subject: Re: Breakerless, electronic  ignition

Robert:

&gt;&gt;What I want is capacitance discharge ignition AND breakerless
points but I have never heard them discussed together. I assume it is done&lt;&lt;

It is done.  I'm no expert, but I don't think that the coil is completely
replaced.  You still have to have a way to step up the voltage.  Some of
these systems (Crane makes one) have their own coil(s).  I just replaced
the points on my '73 911 with a Pertronix ingitor. This car came stock with
CDI ignition, but also has a stock Bosch coil.  My '79 bus (california
emissions) has some kind of solid state ignition electronic system with
hall effect pointless ignition.  THis bus also uses a different coil than
non-hall unit busses.  If you can find the coil, distributor, and ignition
module for a '79 and up aircooled bus with california emissions, it sure is
a sweet, low maintenance way to go IMHO.
