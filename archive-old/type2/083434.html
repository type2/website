&gt; Having torn out the old headliner in the 79 sunroof yesterday, the thought of putting a new one in myself seems almost unbearable.

&gt; Certainly some of you have succeeded. Any war stories to share?
&gt; 
&gt; Suppliers, are they making a 79 headliner? One supplier on the Ebarf said they had 68-77. Whats the diff?
