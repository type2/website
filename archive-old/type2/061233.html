Al Brase pointed out to me about my post regarding sandblasting that perhaps
I assume too much of the readership of the list, and I feel this is a wise
point.

I do assume too much so I'm going for a little warning here in general.  All
body work products have a little CYA litigious US inspired warning reading
something to the effect, only to be sold, mixed, applied by trained
professionals using appropriate equipment etc.  Now, this doesn't stop
anyone round here (MD, PA, WV) from selling to anyone off the street, even
with the HVLP laws that I believe are now in effect in MD.  (On that issue
as I said, HVLP is smart, works for you and the environment, I'm all for
it.)  Although I believe that DP40 recently changed to a slightly safer
formulation for heavy metal reasons, MOST ANY GOOD EPOXY OR URETHANE PRIMER
OR TOPCOAT SYSTEM WILL KILL YOU DEAD.  Heavy metals, and worse isocynates,
ready to do nasty things.  When you buy a product get the application
literature (I think it is law that it is provided, I know the MSDS has to
be) and read it.  Then face some facts, a respirator rated for isocynates if
they still exist (haven't seen one sold since the late 80's) is rather
expensive ($80-$100 then.)  An average organic vapor respirator from Lowes
for $30 don't cut it &quot;by the book&quot; for most systems.  I know a lot of people
who use them, but technically it isn't up to it.  The literature will tell
you what NIOSH,
MSA level respirator is needed and will likely suggest positive pressure
instead of a respirator, a move I made a few years back as I am inclined to
respiratory problems due to my stupidy involving fiberglass dust during my
MS research years.  For that matter during sandblasting you should wear at
least the $30 respirator and I've moved to using a QUALITY dust mask for
mere sanding, the paint still has heavy metals and is an extreme nuisance
dust with fine sanding.  I recently tried the N95 rated nuisance mask, about
$20 for 20 at Lowes or $5 for 2 (you figure which to buy) these are 3M 8210?
masks.  Much nicer than the average cheapo dust mask, fit tight, dual layer,
fit so well that your breath doesn't fog your glasses if you wear them, that
gives you a good idea, and you should be wearing them (glasses), when
sanding, when painting with the respirator if you don't have a half or full
mask, and a
good hood obviously during sandblasting (I wear hooded Tyvek coveralls taped
at ankles and wrists as well as I don't like sand up my orfices.)

You've got one body, make the most of it, decide what level safety you need
to afford, and don't go whining later if you die, shoot all the lawyers and
get over it and all in the immortal words.  A hobby positive pressure system
is about $350, your life is worth a tad more or maybe not, but a lot of cars
have been painted with mere dust masks even with urethane catalysts.  Decide
what you need, how much you intend to do, and obviously if predisposed to
respiratory problems, don't do it period.  Of course if you are an idiot,
please do, but please shoot your entire family before you go so we don't
have to deal with the lawsuit from your stupidity.

That's all well and good, except maybe you're addicted, maybe you can't
stop, because it is the only thing left in life you truly enjoy.  Running
your
hand over the freshly finished contours of a nice bus, or a nice vette, or
whatever.  Or turning a wrench, or lying in the mud under the van with
antifreeze running all over you (have I mentioned recently I hate my
waterboxers), or gasoline, or motor oil.  The truck really got under my skin
this weekend.  I had intended in common sense to part with it because I know
I'll take it too far, don't have the time, or the money now, but damn if I
didn't see an add asking more this last week for one in worse shape, and
after the windshield surround was done I looked down at the perfect contours
in gleaming new pastel white paint, and started saying, well it isn't that
bad, if I just this, or just that I can stop real easy at a daily driver,
and I've got that gallon fof french blue enamel I bought for that bus and
never used, and I've got enough white for the top, and the sheetmetal will
only cost me $300, and what else do I have to do next summer?  I mean I
initially was going to blast just the windshield surround, do a quality
quicky repair, but I just can't do this stuff half assed, so then I figured
well no better time than now to pull and blast and paint that dash as I need
to pull the wiper motor anyway and its SO much easier with the dash out, and
then hell since I did that might as well blast down to the beltline, then
thank god I was about to go ahead and blast the whole front end but I
stopped short, I mean it is December for crying out loud even if I got a 70
degree day to do the topcoat.  These things get under your skin, buy a MIG
and you want a blaster, by the blaster you need a new spray gun, buy the gun
and you need that positive pressure system.

Bonding and whatnot.

Hey the one with the most toys wins, even if you go 20 years early from lung
cancer, what they hell I don't smoke :-)
