Subject: Re: [T2]  locking engine hatch + FIRES  TRUE

If you used a standard fire extinguisher to put out the fire you need to
power wash your engine compartment very good. That white/yellow power is
very corrosive and attacks aluminum in a very short time.

Been there done that! Not much fire damage but that fire extinguisher
made a hell of a mess.
