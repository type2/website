*G*

&gt; So, can you tell me what the differences are? Is it
&gt; the brackets? The bumper itself?

Both.  You might be able to beat a 68-71 bumper into submission
for a '72, but it will never look quite right.  The brackets
are completely different.

&gt; Is it both  front and rear?

Only rear, front is identical '68 through '72.
