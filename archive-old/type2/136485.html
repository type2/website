Subject: Re: [T2]Advance auto Parts

thanks folks i went by and ordered it this morning...
i gave them the bus depot number and they were able to pull it up by that .
it came up under vw porsche part.
15 bucks i didnt have but all is good suppose to be here tomorrow by 9am so i will plan for reinstall of my new engine ONCE AGAIN for thursday now it seems......
 
as far as electrical i think i went through like 3-4 alternators and 2 regulators that were crappy from advance that was my concern for the seal..
i also had heard that viton was the best so wanted to make sure about the beck Arnley....
and yes also about them hiring people that dont know anything so true so true...
i went in the other day and ask if they had any sae 40 castrol and the guy says to me what?
whats that? i said OIL he said ohhhhh no we dont have that? i said to him oil? or sae 40 weight.?
confused now more than him i said look man i just bought some here last week.
i said hey pal wheres the manager i'll ask him he says ohh i am the manager! i said OMFGod you are kidding me and shook my head and walked out went 15 minutes to next auto parts place and got my oil the next place being the other advance across town...
all i can say is WOW
i did say i was in a pickle on the seal though sooooooooo either i pay the 15 bucks for it there or pay high prices for next day shipping from the depot...
i didnt have the 15 bucks to begin with borrowing from peter to pay paul so to speak... arg*&amp;^%(*&amp;^%(*&amp;^%
once again thanks yall..
have a pleasent day
peace and love
chris

That seal you've found is a Beck Arnley. They seem to repackage some parts for resale - at least I have seen that happen before. They are an import parts distributor. FWIW I have never had any problems with a Beck Arnley part. Seem to be pretty good stuff. 

I buy their parts for my VW Cabrio from Napa, I have an oil pan gasket to install next oil change. 

I used to work at Advance Auto Parts and seldom set foot in the place anymore! Their Beck Arnley parts are just as good (same parts) but I would not touch Advance's electrical stuff unless it was a Beck Arnley. 

I am voting with my dollar where Advance is concerned. At the time I worked there they were the world's worst for hiring young folks that didn't know a spark plug from a fan belt and you had to be careful about the parts you bought (name brands were okay) b/c they were just cheap. Chinese brakes rotors that were thinner than the OEM 250K mile rotor a customer brought in...
