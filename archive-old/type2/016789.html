&gt; BEST INSURANCE: .....electric fuel pump drawing from the top of the tank.

Michael:
Huh? This might work if the tank were lower, but I don't see how it will
help on a non-original-equipped-with-electric-fuel-pump situation on a
type 2 and may lead  inexperienced people to hotwire in an electric pump
without a double relay or oil-pressure-triggered relay and subsequently
have something much less safe than a mechanical pump.
Mechanical pumps are safe and efficient and quit when the engine kills
(especially in a wreck or a rollover). I just don't believe electric
pumps have any place on a pre75 type 2 unless one is looking for 80
horsepower or more.(and then only with the above safety interlocks)
