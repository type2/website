Subject: Respirator use with beard

Before I get any more p-mail dissertations on all of the bad things you can
inhale by improper use of a respirator, I know all of the evil solids and
vapors that paint and clear coatings contain, and the harm they can cause
your innards, and if a laboratory rat comsumed 400 lbs of them a day for 500
years, it would cause cancer in California.

Yes, I've heard of isocyanates, the nitrocelluose laquer I used to mix and
sell was packed full of it.  There's several dozen other evil organic
compounds that the coatings industry uses regularly that can kill you too.

The dude just wanted to paint his bus one time.  He didn't say anything
about going into the painting business, or that he was going to be a
respirator salesman.  I didn't think it was necessary to give a 1000 word
lecture, nor a disclaimer.

I also assumed that since he was painting his own bus, he probably didn't
have the cash to spend around 400 bucks on a decent full face respirator.

It probably is more of a risk of your life to drive a Westy in heavy traffic
than to spray a couple of quarts of paint with a respirator on that is not
sealed properly due to a beard.

I spent 8 years lecturing painters on the importance of using respirators,
the damage it was causing their lungs, and the fact they were killing
themselves by not using anything, much less a properly worn respirator, with
good fresh cartridges.  &quot;I've been spraying laquer without one every day for
40 years, why change now&quot; was a common answer.  &quot;Your funeral, bud.&quot;

Please end this thread.
