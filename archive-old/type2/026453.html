Subject: Oil pressure sender - general question
Date: Thu, 3 Dec 1998 15:27:05 -0600 

I got a VDO oil pressure dual sender and gauge at the pick-n-pull from
an 83 Audi.  Looks just like the brand-new one I bought from Bus Depot.
Installed it on my type 1 motor in my 58 single cab and thought, &quot;Cool!
Guage and sender for $7&quot;.

Problem is, while the gauge works just fine, the dummy light works in
reverse.  It goes off when pressure drops below the threshold level of
the sendor, but stays on the rest of the time.  I re-installed the
original idiot light sender and it works right.

Any ideas (other than spring for the $30 to buy the correct sender)?
Maybe Audi used a relay between the sender and the dummy light instead
of direct-wired like the VWs? 

Thanks.
