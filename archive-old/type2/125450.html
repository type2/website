Subject: NEW Jack Point Mounted Ezy-Awning

Our next accessory for the unique Ezy-Awning is now available.

This pair of mounts allows you to attach the Ezy-Awning's legs either to
your bus's jacking points, or under its wheels, so the weight of your
bus holds your awning down. This makes the awning fully self-contained -
no need to stake it down, or even to run a pole to the ground at all.
You can now secure the awning 3 ways - to the jackpoints, to the wheels,
or directly to the ground with a stake through the feet if you are
parked on stakeable ground. Other options (weighted feet, and suction
clamps for use on the rear of a bus or on other vehicles) are also
available.

As before, everything sets up in about 10 minutes with no mods to your
bus, and packs into a tiny bag when not in use. 

The Ezy-Awning is $119, and the new jackpoint/wheel adapters are $39.

See them both at  http://busdepot_dot_com/busdepot/details/awning.jsp .
(Pics of the new jackpoint adapter are about 3/4 down the page.)
