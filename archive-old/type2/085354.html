Subject: Re: [T2] Adding and Converting AC Systems

I've got to jump in here on this one.  From the research I have done, r134
will not work with VW component AC parts.  Two reasons: 1. the compressor
cycle time is different and the VW pressure switch on the evaporator is set
for the r12 which has a different cycle time.  2. the VW condenser is not
large enough to cool the r134.

If someone is using VW AC components, the best solution seems to be with the
&quot;compound&quot; freons.  Compound freons have been on the market now for around
10 years and much has been learned.  The compound freons will cool around 10
percent better than r12 freon and keep the oil in a suspended state for
compressor lubrication unlike the earlier compounds.

You do need to use barrier hoses, but with a new compressor that requires
less than 1/3 the HP the older Yorks required, it is possible to have a cool
bus in the hottest temps and not burn up your engine.

&gt; Scott,
&gt; 
&gt; Where were you planning to get your other parts
&gt; (condenser, evaporator, fans, etc..).  I assume you're
&gt; going with r134, were you going to have barrier hoses
&gt; built?
