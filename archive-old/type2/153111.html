Subject: tow mirrors mounting

Hello all,
Does anyone have a set of tow / wide angle mirrors like these?  I had ask 
this question in the past but had no picture to explain.  
http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds/detail.php?id=222103
I had bought a pair of these but received no mounting hardware (to the 
doors).  I can't figure out a way to mount these.  There must be some pin insert to 
the mount (like a VW Thing's mirror).  The seller gave me no additional help.  
The seller of the bra in the add just used the picture.  Any help would be 
very much appresiated.

Thanks,
Dino Spentzos
Newport, RI
