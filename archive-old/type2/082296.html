Subject: 16th Annual Twin Cities Volkswagen Show

Well we didn't have the annual swap meet but the annual show is a go, this 
year at least.  It will be at Rudy Luther's West Side Volkswagen just off 
County Road 100 in Saint Louis Park, a west Minneapolis suburb, from 9:00 
a.m. to 3:00 p.m. on 9 June 2002.

I hope that we get more Type IIs there this year.
