Subject: Awning for 77 Westy

Anybody ever try an awning from a company called Shadyboy in BC, Canada? 
They have a pretty cool looking awning that sets up quick and stays attached 
to the outside of the camper for $179. I would go ahead and order it, except 
I'm stuck with it if I don't like it. So if anyone has any experience with 
it, I'd love to hear it.

Think it looks to mod for my 77 Westy?

Thanks!
Marvin
