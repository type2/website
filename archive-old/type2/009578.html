Hi Mark

About the stickers.

Try a hair dryer. I had success with that in removing some stickers on my
West. Just do not heat too long at the same place. The glue will melt and
just lift the sticker at the same, time little by little. 

Hope this help. 



&gt; The PO of my 72 Adventure Camper was a serious Deadhead, and the bus is
&gt; covered in all kinds of stickers.  Unfortunately, several of them are
&gt; stuck directly on the paint of the rear hatch and engine compartment
&gt; lid.
