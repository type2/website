Subject: [T2] What causes a 30# compression reading?


&gt; My 1979 2000 engine started misfiring and I troubleshot down to a 30#
&gt; compression on the #4 cylinder.  Now I suspect that either the piston ring
or
&gt; valve seat has failed.  I heard that type II engines are known for valve
seats
&gt; to fail.  Is this true and how will I know when I look at it?

Failing valve seats ?  Where did you hear that :) ???
Try this- Unbolt the rocker shafts from the offending cylinder
head and put a straight-edge across the ends of the valve stems.
You don't need a leak-down test, it's time to remove the head
for a look after it gets down to about 85 psi.
