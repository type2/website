I'll respond directly since this is not an aircooled subject.

To wich I'd like to add:

That remains to be seen. The current Eurovan (just Transporter over here) is
available in many different configurations. That includes short and long
wheelbase (with or without 4WD) and chassis/cab only version. It is notably
a bigger and heavier verhicle than previous models (Vanagon etc).

Karmann also builds campers on Eurovan basis that are quite big. Eurovans
are common as muck over here and I have the impression that the Japanese
vans are losing market share in favour of VW.

Well, next week I can go buy another Eurovan to replace the one that got
stolen last month. Wednesday I'll go and look at 2 used ones. These are
typical Dutch configurations - front seats and 1 extra bench behind that.
The remaining cargo space is completely closed off (no windows there). These
are converted in Holland from closed panel vans that get an extra window in
the sliding door and on the opposite side. A double cab panel van so to say.
These cars are the result of some weird tax-laws only found in Holland.
