&gt; &gt; PS: A while back some one asked about a tour company in Moab Utah
&gt; &gt; who used to use  23 window buses in Moab for tours of red rock
&gt; &gt; country.  I think the company is called Tag A long Tours.  From what I
&gt; &gt; know I think the guy has retired all of the buses and now uses 4WD
&gt; &gt; truck and jeeps.  I think he may still have them sitting around. (This could
&gt; &gt; be a rumor or there could be some good parts or restos) Anyway, from
&gt; &gt; the Moab phone book.
&gt; 
&gt; If it's the place I'm thinking about, they (now?) use Toyota FJ-60s. Rows
&gt; and rows and rows and rows of them.

Nope, it was Lin Ottinger's Rock Shop--one 64(?) sunroof on display in
front, the rest hidden in back and unviewable to the anyone he
doesn't know in no uncertain terms!  8-/  I knew they weren't for sale
for whatever reason and I can understand that.  There was a deal in NEATO's 
OBR &amp; Hot VW's on him a while back.  He now uses a mid 80's 4wd Suburban.  
Tag a Long looks like a more touristy place, Ottinger's is geared towards 
rock-hounds &amp; geologists (like my wife). 

After 2 days at work after vacationing in CO &amp; UT, I wish I was back
there!  8-)
