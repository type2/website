Subject: Re: [T2] Need a wheel to steer

I had no problem removing my wheel. Popped off the horn button, removed the big
nut and lifted the wheel off the steering column. Seems the 75 wheel has no taper
to the splines that hold the steering shaft to the wheel. Therefore no binding
between the wheel hub and shaft. I have heard of people putting pressure on the
bottom side of the wheel with their knees and tapping the steering shaft with a
brass or wooden mallet after backing the nut off till the top of the nut is flush
with the end of the steering shaft. I Know this works on F*rds and Ch*vys built in
the 60s and early 70s. They had tapered splines that would lock the wheel to the
shaft. The drawback is possible damage to the steering box! If anyone tries this
please be extreeeemly careful, I've heard the steering box on a bus is quite
expensive and I do not advocate using techniques the German engineers haven't
recommended. But, if no one makes the puller any more, you gotta do what you gotta
do to get the job done sometimes.

Does anyone know what year the splines were changed from tapered to straight or is
my wheel unique? I hope not. I am extremely board with grinding out the rotten
plastic, patching, and sanding, sanding, san............
Thanks,
Tom
Weather looks good for a weekend motor install : )

&gt; Tom,  Unfortunately I don't think it is the same wheel.  The one I have has
&gt; about 2&quot; spokes that stay constant width from center to edge.  I originally
&gt; pulled this wheel from the junkyard hoping I could swap, but found out
&gt; later that they are not interchangeable.  I happened to see a friend
&gt; yesterday with a '76 bus and he had the same steering wheel as I do, so I
&gt; think you also have what I call the narrow-spoke wheel.  They must have
&gt; changed later, like '78.
&gt;
&gt; More bad news - I have never been able to remove my wheel.  And believe me,
&gt; I have tried.  Some people say they have been able to remove them but
&gt; others have had my experience.  Just a heads up - don't assume you will be
&gt; able to get the wheel off easily if you find a replacement.  I've also not
&gt; seen any of these types of wheels that weren't cracked, although they still
&gt; seem strong.  VW recommends a special puller to remove the wheel but I have
&gt; never seen one in person and nobody seems to sell them.  It looks like a
&gt; small, fat C-clamp.
&gt;
&gt; My solution was to put on a steering wheel cover.  I know a lot of people
&gt; don't like them and think they look tacky.  I agree about the looks, but I
&gt; do like the feel of a thicker wheel.  I actually put on two black covers
&gt; and I'm reasonably happy with the results.  I used the vinyl ones but there
&gt; are leather ones available.  There is a web site that sells them in the
&gt; proper diameter for about $30 if I remember.  If you can't find it I might
&gt; be able to dig it out of the archives or old e-mail.  I know it won't help
&gt; the cracks in the center of the wheel, but it might still be a worthwhile
&gt; improvement.  Joel Walker told me he put on two of them which is where I
&gt; got the idea for myself.  Someone who is good with upholstery ought to be
&gt; able to stitch up a cover for the spokes as well, IMO.
&gt;
&gt; Sorry,
&gt;

&gt; &gt;I am guessing it's the wide spokes. the spokes are about 1 1/2 inch wide at
&gt; &gt;the hub and taper down to about 3/4 inch at the rim. I am looking for a black
&gt; &gt;one preferably but will settle for one that is white or a near white color.
&gt; &gt;What kind of condition is it in and what is your price?
&gt; &gt;Thanks,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Been trying to repair my sun dried steering wheel on my 75 bus. Seems a

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;its going to be pure PC7 by the time I'm done. Getting tired of running
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;in this circle! Does anyone have a steering wheel for a 75 they are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;willing to part with for a reasonable price that is in decent condition?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Is that the one with the wide spokes or the skinny spokes?  My '73 has the
&gt; &gt; &gt; skinny spoke one.  I have a really nice wide-spoke one from a later
&gt; &gt; &gt; baywindow up in the attic somewhere if that happens to be what you need.
