Subject: Dual Batteries



I drove down to Guatemala last yearalong the Pacific with a rusted out
'71... but made it from Canada down and back.  I know one way to get 2
batteries working is just hook them up together.  You can even use jumper
cables.  (saved me twice).  Another option is you get a switch that will
let you select from one to the other.  just flip them over to change them.

Maybe it's a hacked way of doing things, but in the middle of the desert
with only a leatherman knife i learned to use what i had.

interesting true story, met a dude from malibu that drove down to panama in
his bus.  right near central america the engine was causing problems, so he
dropped it with his swiss army knife, a rock and a stick.  he managed to
open it and fix it up enough to get home to california.  true story...  (in
the end he would of crossed to south america but those borders are darn
scary down there)

peace,
shawn
