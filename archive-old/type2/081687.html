Chris, I sent this reply to you and the list. Just like pmails I have sent
you, your mail box rejects all mail. Here is the reason:

&quot;Your message cannot be delivered to the following recipients:

I tried to send you info about the Vanagon electronic ignition that I wrote up
about 6 years ago, but it got returned also.

&gt; &gt; I know there is Petronix and other brands of breaker points eliminators -
&gt; &gt; but has anyone modified a VW electronic ignition system to work with a '78
&gt; &gt; 2.0 Type IV?
&gt;
&gt; There is nothing to modify to put the 79 Cal ignition in any typeIV bus
&gt; engine. It is a drop-in swap. Only tough part about it is moving the dist
&gt; drive about 90 degrees.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Not only would I like to eliminate the breaker points, I would like to add
&gt; &gt; a computerized ignition system that recognizes pinging and adjusts the
&gt; &gt; timing (when the coil is fired).
&gt;
&gt; For this you would need a knock sensor system. I don't know of any that will
&gt; interact with the Bosch electronic ignition of 79-83 vintage. 80-83 Cal
&gt; Vanagons used an idle stabilizer to change timing at idle, but it had no
knock
&gt; sensor.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I have heard about using '79+ electronic ignitions - but what years
&gt; &gt; specifically fit? '79 through '83?
&gt;
&gt; 79 -83 Calif version vehicles.
&gt; The 68-79 Bentley has a section on it. There is more info on it in the 80-85
&gt; Vanagon Bentley, starting on page 28.8.
&gt; &gt; I have heard that other brands of cars used Bosch internals that can be
&gt; &gt; retrofitted to a VW Type IV such as even Yugos. Anyone know of the brands?
&gt;
&gt; Yugos used Bosch ignition. But no knock sensor. To use it in a VW, you have
to
&gt; modify the housing to fit the VW case. But why?? You would gain nothing. The
&gt; factory VW system works as designed.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I have heard of building an ignition system using Chrysler replacement
&gt; &gt; parts and/or a ping detector/sensor (what is the REAL name for this
&gt; &gt; component) from a water cooled VW. Anyone know about this?
&gt;
&gt; No clues.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I know that the ping sensor is constructed to recognize (tuned to)
specific
&gt; &gt; frequencies so it does not trip on simple mechanical noises and the
&gt; &gt; aircooled engine is certainly a noisy beast... Which sensor and where
&gt; &gt; should it be located on  the engine?
&gt;
&gt; No knock sensor is accurately tuned to tune out engine noises other than
&gt; pinging. You ought to see what happens to timing when a timing chain
stretches
&gt; on a Mercedes V8 and starts tapping on the head! The knock sensors are
mounted
&gt; at the base of the cylinders. The noise telescopes thru out the block. Even
a
&gt; hydraulic lifter screws up the knock sensors.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I know that the aircooled Porsche had fancy electronic ignition systems
and
&gt; &gt; there is a Corvair supplier that has a system for about $500 that is tuned
&gt; &gt; for the Corvair engine. It will adjust the timing for each cylinder.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Sadly I don't have $500 for this gadget which is not tuned for a VW
engine.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'd like to learn more about modern adaptive ignition systems if anyone
&gt; &gt; could lecture me on it a bit.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Also I would not be afraid to do some reading on it if anyone could point
&gt; &gt; me in the right direction...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks!!!
