&gt; &gt;My question is; are there alternative campgrounds that are perhaps
&gt; &gt;smaller, unusual,
&gt; &gt;and cheaper through the US ? Where do bus folk go when traveling ? How
&gt; &gt;does one
&gt; &gt;find these places ?
&gt; 
&gt;      As others mentioned, state parks are usually good. Different costs 
&gt; in different states-stayed at sinks canyon state park in Wyoming in 96, 
&gt; cost about 4 bucks, and was one of the best sites we had on a 7 week run. 
&gt; Also, I've read many posters on this list have used BLM locations, 
&gt; apparently they are free(BLM being Bureau of Land Management, Federally 
&gt; owned lands; and I've never used them personally).

Most BLM land is available for camping, but there are few developed
campgrounds.  You simply pick a spot and camp!  Unfortunately, the rules
vary from area to area considering how near or far from roads to camp,
campfires, length of stay, etc.  If you're paranoid, check with the local
BLM office for instructions.  If not, just be inobtrusive and you probably
won't be bothered.
