&gt; I had the same thing on DARTHVW, and the PO put in new

&gt; the line in dfaded white ink.

Simply having the word &quot;Germany&quot; stamped on the hose isn't any guarantee
of quality.  In fact, I've never been all that impressed with the quality
of German rubber products.

The purpose of the outside braid is twofold.  First, it protects against
abrasion.  Second, if there is a leak, the outer braid soaks up the
gasoline and lets it evaporate without dripping on, say, the exhaust pipe.
Hopefully, this allows you to smell a gas leak before it actually starts
dripping.

US-made hose tends to have another layer of rubber over the braid, giving
a smooth outer surface.

I'd lean toward using US-made fuel line if it can be found in the correct
diameter.  The reasoning is that the US line is made with the witch's brew
of gasoline we get here in the US in mind.  I'm not sure if they have that
stuff to worry about in Germany.  

I'm tempted to sleeve all the fittings slightly larger so that I can use
ordinary 1/4 line.
