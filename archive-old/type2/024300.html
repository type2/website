&gt; That is I have a gas leak, it seems . 

If the float is stuck or too high expect to see carbon build up on the spark plugs from an overrich condition. Check float level first. No, you don't normally need a rebuild kit as the top cover gasket can be reused UNLESS it is a dozen years old or was ever over tightened (typical) which warps the top cover which can affect float level.

The carb kits generally available are designed to be cheap. Any Brazillian part is nothing like a German part in metallurgy, fit, finish or function.
Despite any up front costs, the German parts are most effective when the
lowest long term cost per mile is the goal. Want to make it run and sell to 
the next kid that falls off the truck? Use the cheap stuff. Want to keep and use without problems for the long haul? Save yourself time and money by using the parts designed by the original engineers, assemble and adjust to their 
specifications and maintain the systems appropriatly.

If the float were stuck you would see WAY TOO MUCH gas all over the place, not
just a weeping. You are correct that solving this problem is necessary before
further use due to the danger of destruction or injury by fire.
