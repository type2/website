&gt; Hi all,
&gt; I just picked up a tranny in a wrecking yard for my '71 Bus. On the
&gt; nose-cone there are two, two-pronged switches threaded into it. One is
&gt; obviously the back-up light switch...(cause it's in the right spot)...
&gt; The other is located on the face, just above the back-up light
&gt; switch...(hope yer still following me, here). Anyone out there have any
&gt; idea what it's for?...will it be ok just to leave it?...should I take
&gt; it out and put a plug in it's place?
&gt; Thanks in advance,

I'd guess that's for a 72-73? that uses a solenoid to cut off full
vacuum advance till you're in 4th gear (below a certain temperature).
The problem with that is that (if it's a 72 or later) the input shaft of
the transmission is probably too long. Does the bellhousing have the two
hanger bosses at the top above the engine to trans bolt holes?
It's possible to change out the input shaft and put in the one from your
old transmission, but you've gotta take it apart somewhat. Easier would
be to use a grinder to shorten it, but you should proceed slowly, and
not get the shaft too hot.
Anyway compare it to your old one for length!
