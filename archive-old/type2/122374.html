&gt; It may be the Jake Raby doesn't like them, but he is building engines

How has he become such an expert on hydraulic lifters when he claims to have
last used them in 1996? I imagine he doesn't buy well maintained working
engines by and large; he buys abused cores. Frankly to put it in
perspective, Jake has become an expert on the negatives, not how they work
when properly maintained in stock engines. We are comparing the opinion of
someone who doesn't use them, period, to list members who drive them every
day and rack up tens to hundreds of thousands of miles.

I prefer the balanced opinion of someone like Shad Laws.

On the surface for most folks who keep perpetuating the misinformation it
just seems like another case of later models getting beat up as undesirable
while the superior parts are picked off one by one each year and adapted to
the earlier &quot;desirable&quot; models. Whether it's post-67 bigotry, Type IV
engines, FI or hydraulics. It's all about comfort level and to some degree
ignorance.

These adjustment screws came out of the superior solid lifter engine:

Who's really to blame: the owner or VW engineering?
