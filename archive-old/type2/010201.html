&gt; Thanks ahead of time,

&gt; Im having a heck of a time getting the brakeline loose the not that
&gt; attaches 
&gt; the brakeline to the brakecenter wantts to turn on the wrench and it
&gt; looks 
&gt; like I may have to give it a go with vise grips, I did oil the sucker
&gt; first 
&gt; and it still wont turn, is there a trick to this

The trick is called a &quot;brake line wrench&quot;  It looks like a box end
wrench with a bit nipped out so that you can slip it over the brake
line.  It holds the nut like a box wrench so it cannot slip.  Please
try one of these before you resort to vise-grips.  I may be the next
one to own your bus :)

I usually squirt the fitting with Liquid Wrench for two or three days
(a couple of applications per day) before I try to break them loose. 
When reinstalling, I put a dab of anti-sieze on the threads (keep it
out of the system, though!)
