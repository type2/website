Hiya Mark,
Wednesday we'll try to camp somewhere in Southern Oregon (any 
suggestions?).

Bastendorff Beach is a county park in southern Oregon.  Right on the beach.  
Very nice place and probably just about in the right spot for your overnight.  
One other thing, Oregon is loaded with great camp sites, mostly in the State 
Park system.  So, you're never too far away from a good place to park for the 
night.

Mike
