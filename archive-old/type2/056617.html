&gt;I have recently purchased a'78 Westy, which I have been informed is the
&gt;champagne edition.  My bus is brown and white, but all of the
&gt;information I've been able to locate on the Web talks about a brown/red
&gt;version.  Is my Westy truly a champagne edition, and if so does anyone
&gt;know its true value.  It's in very good conditon not perfect, but very
&gt;good.  Also, it is an automatic.  Can anybody help me?

I think the rule of thumb with VW busses is, &quot;What the market will
bear&quot;.  :-) By most list member's estimation, since the C.E.s are
rarer, they are probably worth more, right?  But the trick is finding
a buyer willing to pay more because of that fact. :-)

What you describe, white over brown, was indeed the color combo for
the 78 C.E. Westy.  I believe it was the only two-tone baywindow Westy
ever sold by VW (but I may be wrong--love to know about it if I am).
The standard 78 C.E. had the red-over-brown color scheme you mention.

Along the line of unusual sightings, out here in the Seattle area
yesterday I saw a 77 Champagne Edition that had been converted to a
Riviera Camper by ASI.  I talked to the guy to be sure I was looking
at what I thought I was, and sure enough...  it even had the
cream/grayish corduroy seats, hidden under 2 layers of seat covers.
The owner had to go digging--he said he had never had the seat covers
off to look at the seats.
