Subject: Re: compression test, safety

Best trick for compression testing is just to turn over the
solenoid/starter with nothing else on- like wire in a switch to it or clamp
on a connector to solenoid and hold other end to battery (+).  On my 71, I
even attached a piece of 12g house wiring  to the starter and left other
end near battery, where I touched it when needing to start sticky starter
or do compression test.  Usually you can pull the (+) ignition wire to coil
(=no primary circuit to coil) and the wire to center of distributor (no
spark possible to plugs) and have someone run the starter from up front.
Use the screw in gauge with the foot long hose on kit; you learn to FEEL
the end threading in as you hold hose withn one hand at right angle to plug
hole and twist the gauge end to thread in.  This is an ART in the later
busses, since #2 plug hole is pretty deep; I just memorize the angle of the
plug connector and run the gauge hose the same way.  Watch the gauge as
someone turns starter and yell when it peaks.  Make sure engine is warmed
up (oil on cyl. walls) to operating temp., and pull all plugs first.
True, some gas is going in in carebureted busses, but it dissipates quickly
with open plug holes, and really isn't much with 10 sec. turnovers. The
manuals I read say to use full throttle when you do this, presumably to cut
vacuum?   In  FI bus, I believe you can pull double relay connector, and
pump won't run?     Re Idiot book, I'm sure he at least says to yank center
wire off distributor or coil?  MB
