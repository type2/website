Mark,

The German ATE brake servos are interchangeable * though I  haven't  seen a
68 through 70 bus in the US with disc brakes* from 68 through November of
73-- Part # 211611905... Then from December 73 through 79 --Part #
211612103A .

Happy hunting.

Bob

&gt; tomorrow i'm gonna go over everything in my van,starting with ignition and
&gt; working up, just to make sure that my problem is indeed the servo.
&gt;
&gt; if i do need one, what year busses are compatible?  i've had some people
&gt; offer some to me from different years, and there is also some good local
&gt; junkyards around that i'm sure i could yank one from, but i need to know
&gt; year compatablility.....thanks.....
&gt;
&gt; mark. '78 fi van.
