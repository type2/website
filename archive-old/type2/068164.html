&gt;PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.

&gt;Think of what you do when a vehicle has their high beams on comes
&gt;towards you. You turn your eyes away from the BRIGHT light.

&gt;Bright lights are NOT for making yourself visible to others, they're
&gt;for making the road visible to you.

WOO HOO!!  Looks like I've found another contentious issue!  :-)

OK, maybe I should have written the offending suggestion more clearly: I
intended to indicate that using high-beams during the day is effective when
driving *off pavement* in a VW bus.

I was hoping people would not infer it is acceptable to drive with your
rack of million candle power floods blazing on the bush bar while blasting
through the night on US101.  Jeff's right: it would not be neighbourly to
do that.

I like the principles of Courtesy 101, but let's face the fact that what's
appropriate on paved highways may not make sense on a dirt track in the
sticks.

And not to flame you Jeff, but contrary to your assertion a major function
of headlights *is* to make your vehicle more visible to people ahead of
you.  The effectiveness of daytime headlight use in reducing many types of
MVAs has been shown time and time again.  I always (day and night) drive
with my headlights on, and I encourage others to do the same.  It's a
public safety issue, sure, but I also have an interest in saving my own
skin.

Here's the reality of off-pavement driving in B.C. (taking logging roads as
a pretty fair &quot;typical&quot; example in B.C.):

1) If you've fitted your bus with kajillion watt high beams, then yeah,
don't blast people with 'em during the day *or* night.  But you're not
going to blind anybody with the stock high-beams on a breadloaf bus in
broad daylight.  Ain't gonna happen.

2) You might meet an on-coming car once every 15 - 20 minutes.  During rush
hour, that is.

3) Given that the roads are so twisty, high-beams in the day *can* increase
the distance people will notice you from.  You'll have to trust me on this
if you haven't experienced these conditions before.  In the mountains, it's
really unusual to get a straight section of road longer than 100 yards.

4) The grades can be very steep.  Not steep as in &quot;gee, I can't hold 4th
gear&quot; but steep as in &quot;my steering is really getting weird, and if I have
to stop I'll never get traction again.&quot;  As Malcolm said, you don't want to
meet an on-coming car &quot;by surprise&quot; is this situation if you can avoid it.

5) If there *is* high traffic on a dry unpaved road, you'll need high beams
to cut through the dust to make yourself visible--low beams will *not* be
visible at a far enough distance to do you any good.

6) If you're lucky enough to be driving dirt roads when they're not muddy,
there may be a lot of dust around: dust kicked up by the wind, dust kicked
up from other vehicles.  Wanna know a common hazard?  Imagine this scenario
(something close to this happens nearly every summer up here) :
    You're driving along with your dusty low-beams.  Jethro is coming the
other way in his Toyota 4x4, following closer than he should behind a 200
ton loaded logging truck.  Man, does Jethro ever want to pass that
slow-poke dust machine!  You've seen the logging truck coming for a couple
minutes now since its off-road lights glint as it winds around the corners,
popping into view every now and then up the canyon, so you find a straight
stretch, slow down and move over enough to allow the logging truck to blow
by.  Jethro had been watching out down the canyon, seen the straight
stretch coming up, and uses it to peg his accelerator and boot it through
the logging truck's thick dust cloud, pushing his Toyota up to 35, 40, 45
mph.  He's really charging and he swings out to pass --and plows into you
head on with that big high bumper.  The logging truck never realizes what
happened behind him, and just rumbles on.  You're out of cell phone range,
CB range, and over 70 km from the nearest paved road.  It's beautifully
quiet out in the wilderness...


All that said, please accept the above as appropriate for conditions in the
mountains in B.C.  In the Mojave desert, where you spot people by the
approaching dust cloud a few miles across the flats, day time lights may
not be so important.  Paved surfaces are a *totally* different environment,
so when driving paved roads please do not follow the suggestions I provided
for off pavement driving.  Just as important, however, do not try to apply
pavement driving principles to off pavement conditions--it's not
appropriate, and could well endanger you and others.

Taking your bus well away from the nearest paved roads can be very, very
rewarding but requires some extra preparation of the vehicle and addtional
care on the part of the driver.  High visibility, conservative driving
technique, and basic vehicle preparation will bring you home safe and
sound.  Courtesy 101 should be a requirement for drivers on paved roads;
for off pavement driving there should be a supplementary Courtesy 201
offering.
