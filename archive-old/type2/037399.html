Barry,
Do you have a problem with your battery dying?  Maybe that sounds like a dumb question but I've had my bus for 4 years now and have forgotten my lights (leaving only the parking lights on when the bus is off) and the battery is never dead.  Once they were on for about 10 hours.  I thought that was the whole idea to save the battery by shutting off the headlights.
