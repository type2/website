Subject: starter sticking on/BA6 ignition coil

my starter is sticking on.
I turn the key off, and it keeps going.

(things like this make me happy I never
got around to really tightening down
the battery ground strap)

Battery voltage is ok.

I'm fairly certain it's the solenoid
on the starter not kicking out. I recently
replaced it (the solenoid) and it appears
to have worked loose ever so slightly.

Just looking for some words of wisdom
before I spend a very cold hour or so
under the bus.

while I am thinking about cold, is the coil
on the BA6 anything special? I tend to doubt
that it is. I have a BA6 body
in great condition, but the associated accessories
I have are worn/missing etc.
 
I need to rig up something to provide some heat 
before I freeze.  :P
