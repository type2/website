&gt; I've been thinking about adding a second battery to my 77 Westfalia for
&gt; auxiliary camping purposes.
&gt;
&gt; Through some research there seems to be two major options, First being the
&gt; diode isolator method.   I'm not sure if I like this idea
&gt; considering that a diode is a semiconductor which will knock my charging
&gt; voltage down considerably (~ 1 volt).  Hence the batteries might never
&gt; receive a full charge and the life of the battery might be deprecated
faster
&gt;
&gt; The second option is to employ a separator,  this system is more
&gt; sophisticated in that it uses relays and a simple circuit that
&gt; monitors the charge of the batteries.  As one battery becomes charged it
will switch
&gt; charging to the second battery.  This system seems to be the way to go,
&gt; however  at about $150 it is much more expensive and I have not seen any
&gt; recommended manufacturer installations for VWs



Sometimes the best solutions are the easiest and cheapest ones.  In this
case there is a very good solution for under $20.

This is the relay setup used by Westfalia in the first place on both Bus and
Vanagon campers that were factory-equipped with dual batteries.  You can
piece together the parts you need for under $20, or save yourself the hassle
and buy Hella's kit that is designed exactly for that purpose.  My part #
1738, all of $18.95, includes fused relay, wiring, and instructions.  One of
my most popular items; I sell them by the hundreds!

The concept is simple and safe, which is why VW/Westfalia used it in the
first place.  The single relay essentially goes in line between your
alternator and your aux battery, triggered by your ignition switch.  When
the ignition is off, the relay it opens, isolating the starting battery from
the camping battery, so no matter how dead your aux battery gets it cannot
kill your starting battery.  When you turn the engine on,  it connects the
aux battery back to the alternator to be recharged.  You hook up anything
you wish to run while parked to the aux battery (via a fuse) and this way
when parked they run directly off of the aux camping battery.  While
driving, since the aux battery is then connected into the charging system at
that point, those accessories are essentially running off of the alternator
just as they are with a single-battery setup.  Simple but very functional
solution.

Besides the relative ease of installation and the cost advantages of this
system, there are other benefits.  One is reliability, versus an isolator
setup.  I had an isolator in my '77 Westy.  I even used specific wiring for
a VW electrical system provided by the manufacturer's tech support, and used
a unit rated at much more than it needed to be. On two different occasions,
the diodes failed.  When this happens, the isolator allows your starting
battery to discharge into your aux battery when your aux battery runs down.
You generally won't know your isolator has failed until you go to restart
the bus, and discover that you can't because your isolator let your starting
battery die.  By comparison, a relay failure may prevent the aux battery
from recharging but would be unlikely to cause a situation where your bus
wouldn't start.

The other advantage is safety.  Some people have suggested using an A/B
switch or a solenoid with a heavy wire for the second battery.  There is a
risk of explosion if one battery is totally dead and all of the sudden a
fully-charged battery is switched into the circuit.  The fully-charged
battery wants to dump all of its juice right to the dead one very quickly,
and, as with jumpstarting a car, there can be an explosion risk involved
depending on how dead the aux battery is.  Again, a simple solution.
Westfalia (and Hella with this kit) eliminated this risk by intentionally
using a higher-gauge wire to go to the relay and the second battery.  While
you may think that this increases the risk due to a thinner wire, in
actuality it decreases it.  The wire actually acts as to limit flow from the
starting to the aux battery when the ignition switch is turned on. This
forces a gradual charge, preventing the aux battery from getting a sudden
huge zap regardless of how dead it may be.  There is, however, a downside.
SInce the aux battery is essentially getting &quot;trickle-charged&quot; when you
drive rather than rapidly charged, if you severely deplete your aux battery
it may take a few hours of driving to fully charge it again.  Weighed
against the reliability, safety, and cost benefits of this design, I think
most users will find this drawback to be of minimal importance.  How often
will you run your camping battery totally to the ground (which may take days
of use without running the van depending on what accessories you are using),
and then need to do it all over again without driving at least a couple of
hours in between?  If your answer is &quot;often,&quot; then you may want to consider
one of the more expensive configurations.  But if it is &quot;seldom or never,&quot;
then I think this is the way to go.  It's safe, cheap, and reliable - what
more can you ask?
