&gt; I also  have that problem of ring sealing, even with Total Seal gapless

&gt; They told me the seal  is too good, and the compressor is pulling it
&gt; through the intake valve  guides. Maybe so. What do you think?

&gt; Hey Guys  I think the problem is that you can't seat them like you do  in a
&gt; vehicle by putting a load on them and then creating back pressure.  I  would
&gt; think that they will seat in time.  later  mark D

Wasn't there some procedure involving Bon Ami polishing compound for
seating difficult rings?

For the valve guides, could valve guide seals be added?

Or, would it be better to just make a big oil seperator and leave
everything well-lubed?
