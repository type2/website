&gt;&gt; That's exactly the argument I'm making and I will agree that Weber carbs
&gt;&gt; and extractors are certainly bad.  But I believe in stock big-time.

Preach, Brother Sean!

&gt;
&gt;    Well, there you are -- see, that's the problem. Extractors and
&gt;Webers aren't bad in the slightest -- VW themselves would use them if

Maybe I'm paraphrasing St. Bob here, but I don't see the point of an
extractor system without the use of enlarged j-tubes.  Seems to me that
stock-size exhaust on two cylinders and non-stock on two would be 
something less than logical.  And then we go back to the whole &quot;If VW
engineered it that way, and it's lasted this long, then what's the problem&quot;
issue.  And I just *totally* don't wanna go there.  Not today.

&gt;they could, but for one, they're just too expensive, and for another,
&gt;they've got to deal with emissions. 

Tell me what a muffler has to do with emissions in anything more than a trivial sense.  Does it soak up all of the foul air coming from the internal 
combustion process? Do I have a hidden catalytic converter in my 
peashooters?

&gt;My attitude toward emissions is we
&gt;need to outlaw any engine over 2 liters for personal transportation. And
&gt;outlaw cars period inside city limits. But then I'm a radical
&gt;EarthFirster. 

Not much of an EarthFirster, are ya?  You drive an old, polluting vehicle
that gets 18-21mpg everyday to work.  They do make cars that pollute a 
HELLUVA lot less, you know.  For example.  Go buy yourself a Rabbit Diesel.
Gets 45-50mpg like it is, stock.  Convert the oil to use Vegetable-based
lubricant.  Convert the fuel to use vegetable-based ecodiesel.  

Or you could just buy an electric car!  Generate the power via solar panels
at your house!  OR!  Just move closer to work.  Move close enough to walk.
Or bike.  Mobile's a mild climate, right?  And flat, to boot!

Sounds like you need to take another look at your degree of &quot;radical&quot;
thinking.  As far as I'm concerned, you're just like every one of those
rednecks I know that drives their '74 Nova 350 from their trailer out in
the county into work at the factory every day.

A Radical EarthFirster?  Poseur.
