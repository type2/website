&gt;Another reason for sagging could the rotting of the 2 fat doughnuts where
&gt;a torsion bar meets the springplate; but to replace those, you will
&gt;basically have to follow the same procedure as when readjusting the
&gt;torsion bars. Just make sure you buy those doughnuts (West Coast Metric
&gt;has them) before you take things apart.

When installing the torsion bushings mentioned above, they will fit the hole
*really* tight. It is important to refrain from using any petroleum products as
a lubricant to ease installation as the petrol products will attack the rubber
and destroy it in short order. Use only baby powder (TALC, NOT the cornstarch
kind). Also, if you opt to adjust the torsion bars, use new bushings. They're
less than $5 each (4 of them). You'll pay forever if you don't with squeeking
every time you go over a bump.

In my case, my springs needed adjustment to raise the rear. Yes, it is common.
Some people opt to adjust the front beam (not an easy task, not for the
beginner, sometimes easier to install adjustable front beam...big job) for a
sportier &quot;lowered&quot; look. Not me. Gimme ground clearance any day.  =:-)

&quot;I enjoy looking over that full size Ford pickup in front of me. I can haul more
weight, too!&quot;
