Subject: Re: [T2] fuel injector seal dropped into intake

Many years ago I dropped a metal washer into a Volvo 122's SU carb (there's a
big mouth on those) while it was running. It got sucked in, rattled around for
a few seconds while I held my breath, waiting for the engine to implode, when
it spit it out into the exhaust. It ran just as well after that, rust finally
killed it before the engine gave out. I learned not to take the air filter off
with it running again. If an engine survived that I doubt a rubber seal could
do any permanent damage, probably get spit out or burn up.
