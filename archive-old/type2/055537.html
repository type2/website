I might have guessed as much.

In 20 years and nearly 300,000 miles of driving VW buses I never had a loose 
or defective Bosch plug until a couple of years ago.

Since then I've dealt with several of these episodes.  EVERY TIME it turned 
out to be an India or Brazil manufactured Bosch plug.  

The worst episode was when the center electrode/plug core blew completely out 
of a Bosch plug, leaving the metal base and ceramic shell intact.  This was 
not a backfire event.  It happened while cruising down the road and the sudden 
drop in power nearly caused an accident.  Not to mention the fire hazard of 
having hot sparks flying around the right side of the engine room (it was #1 
that popped).

It's becoming more and more difficult to find German-made Bosch plugs here.  I 
refuse to use the India-made plugs, but sometimes have no option but to use 
Brazil-made plugs.  I don't know what's different, but the Brazil plugs work 
loose in less than 5,000 miles.  I use the same torque and thread lubricant 
I've used for decades, but they still have to be retightened regularly.
