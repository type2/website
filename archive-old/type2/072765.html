&gt;Steve,
&gt;
&gt;That sounds like an excellent idea!  If you have a test for the harness, I
&gt;would love to have it!

Steve(n)
What exactly is your symptom. Start/ no start;  rough running; cutting out;
What?

Not my test but a compilation of resistance test from the four or five
manuals I found during my recent &quot;rich &quot;running problem.

1. Take the harness off the ECU

2. Look in the list library (EFI-Samick, I think) for a description of the
numbering on the pins.

3. put ohm meter contact between #13 and #17 ground.  This tests the
Temperature sensor II.  At 68 degrees it should be between 2000-2900 ohms.
(700-1000 _at_122 degrees; 200-400 _at_ 176 degrees; and less than 200 at
operating temp.)  Testing this at the plug test whether there is a problem
in the harness too.

4.  Test between #6 and # 27 to check the Air temp sensor in the AFM.  It
should be between 2100-2900 _at_ 68 degrees.

Note: if you find a problem,  check the readings at the device.  This will
tell whether its the harness or the devise.

5. Test the following AFM circuits:

            6 &amp; 7      40-300 ohms

            6 &amp; 8      130-260 ohms

            6 &amp; 9      200-400 ohms     (100-300 ohms)

            7 &amp; 8      100-500 ohms     (80-200 ohms)

            8 &amp; 9      70-140 ohms

The readings to the (side) are from bentley for 76 up models but I found
that the Bentley figures didn't jive with the other manuals and were to
restrictive.  (You'll be throwing away good part if you use Bentley)


There are others but try these  first as these are the crucial ones.

LET ME  KNOW?

Have fun

PS

Here's some more info I found on the web somewhere:

The Air-flow meter.

Couple of things you can do with this one. First, loosening the gear inside
the meter tends to richen the mixture. 3 Notches
give about 2% change in lambda. About 5 notches should be enough to bring
cars with cats the 3-5% power increase
advertised by some 'tuning' facilities. Use a lambda sensor for accurate
mixture calibration.

This is what an L connector looks like, 1 is on the top left,18 top
right,19 bottom left,35 bottom right. Designations
are:

       1.Ignition coil primary
       2.Throttle position/Idle switch
       3.Throttle position/WOT switch
       4.Main relay
       5.Earth
       6.Air flow earth
       7.Air flow something
       8.Air flow something
       9.Air flow something
       10.Main relay
       11. NC
       12. Altitude compensator
       13.Coolant temperature sensor
       14.Injectors
       15.Injectors
       16.Earth
       17.Earth
       18.NC
       19.NC
       20.Mainrelay
       21-22. NC
       23. Lambda sensor ground
       24. Lambda sensor
       25. NC
       27. Airflow sensor inlet air temp
       28.NC
       29.NC
       30.Injectors
       31.injectors
       32.Injectors
       33.Injectors
       34.Auxiliary air valve (not used)
       35.Earth



Some data of Bosch injectors:

       0 280 150 208 = 133 cc/minute
       0 280 150 209 = 176 cc/minute
       0 280 150 704 = 170 cc/minute
       0 280 150 614 = 189 cc/minute
       0 280 150 715 = 149 cc/minute
       0 280 150 716 = 134 cc/minute
       0 280 150 203 = 185 cc/minute
       0 280 150 201 = 236 cc/minute
       0 280 150 211 = 146 cc/minute
       0 280 150 121 = 178 cc/minute
       0 280 150 125 = 188 cc/minute
       0 280 150 114 = 185 cc/minute VW Transporter Type I
       0 280 150 116 = 185 cc/minute VW Transporter Type II

Try here for Toyota injectors

178 cc is good for 138 hp, you can estimate the others with ratios.

Typical values:

       Opening current 4A
       Holding current 2A
       Coil resistance 2-3 ohms
       Operating pressure 3 bar
