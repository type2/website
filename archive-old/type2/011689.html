X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

So far we have 8 Volks wanting to go to this little event
starting with a parts picking excursion at Bry's of Seattle
followed by a short caravan to Alki for late lunch early
dinner or bring your own food. (whatever).
  Everyone is welcome. If your bus is down or you are
buseless at the moment you are still welcome! This is just
a
informal gathering of &quot;the bus tribe&quot;.... Ken M., can you
pass this on to the Cascade Kombi Volks?

             later, Dan
