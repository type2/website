Subject: Re: [T2] Odd Question

Just bolt it someplace and swap the wire from the new horn to the old horn. 
Bolt it tightly to the frame as it has to make electrical contact to the 
frame for the horn to work.

No I don't think it will violate the warranty BUT if there is trouble I 
would swap the horns again and don't say A WORD to them as they will use 
anything to keep for paying for a repair if they can. It shouldn't hurt a 
thing.

&gt;I know this is a BUS list, but I wonder...is it possible to hook up a old 
&gt;Bug horn to the New Beetle? If so would it violate the warranty? And where 
&gt;do I find the same kind of list (or if anyone knows it) like this one???
