James,

The one other thing I've heard is esteroil (one of the
new oils for R134A) tends to seal old hoses and lets
you get by with R134A.  The real test would be if
someone has successfully done this conversion without
changing compressor and hoses.  I actually wouldn't
mind a slight leak with R134A.  One or two cans of
this per year wouldn't hurt me or the environment. 
One or two cans a month is a little too leaky.
