Subject: Volkswagen Campmobile Manual Reprints For Sale

--part1_47.1b0b1291.29df45e9_boundary

Hello All,
I have come across an original Westfalia Volkswagen Campmobile Manual and I 
am willing to sell reprints of the same for $10 which includes shipping 
anywhere in the continental US.
The manual was printed in August 1972 and covers all aspects of the Westfalia 
Campmobile including all components and how to use them, equipment options 
and removing various items that you don't want to use.  The manual is 28 
pages long.
The manual deals with the 1973 model but is appropriate for pre 1974 bay 
window campers.
If you are interested please email me off the list.
Regards,
Al
1973 Westfalia
1960 Sunroof Beetle
1968 Sunroof Beetle
1969 Conv Beetle
