Landon:

Sounds like you had a tough go of it.

Before you go and replace your master cylinder, I would make sure that: 1)
you have your brakes bled completely to remove any air in the system and 2)
you have the rear brakes shoes adjusted properly (I'm assuming that the
fronts are disk brakes, if no adjust them also).

The fact that the emergency brake isn't working correctly often suggests
that there is too much clearance between the brake shoe and brake drum,
which in-turn requires excessive travel in the brake pedal/master cylinder
(and e-brake) to overcome.  This clearance is adjusted using the &quot;stars&quot;
you mentioned.  The idea is that you want just barely enough clearance so
that the brake shoes disengage the drums when the brake pedal is released.
By minimizing this clearance, you also minimize the distance the brake
pedal must be pushed before engaging the drum.  This is not a hard
procedure.  Muir, Bentley and Haynes should all have a procedure to
describe this adjustment.

If things still don't work properly following this adjustment, and you are
certain there is no air in the system, only then would I consider replacing
the master cylinder.
