Steve Dolan gave a nice review of the different
scenarios for the brake warning light to come on.

Steve: My brake light AND generator idiot lights
come on when I pull the dash lever down to
activate my heater fan.
Does this sound like a crossed wire? or ground short?,
or do these lights together mean something else?
Anxious drivers need to know.

The heater fan on my '73 Westy (and everything else)
seems to be working fine, but I won't rest until I fix
it so that they don't come on like this.

Any thoughts???

Steve's Post:
Subject: Idiot Light (Dual Brake Circuit Warning Light)
The red light on the dash with a B imprinted on it is the 
dual circuit
brake warning light.  It is a simple &quot;and&quot; logic that 
measures voltage
from both of the brake light switches on the master 
cylinder.  If one is
supplying voltage (is working) and the other is not (is not 
working) then
the light comes on to let you know that half your brakes 
have failed.  If
the light comes on when you apply the brakes, it is 
definitely time to
stop driving and fix something!  Especially if it is a 
brief flash as the
brakes are engaged!

On different years of bus there are three different bulb 
tests that are
applied.  On some years, you press the B and it lights, on 
some years the
bulb comes on when you start the car and goes off when the 
car starts
(along with the gen light), and on some years the light 
comes on when the
parking brake is engaged.
