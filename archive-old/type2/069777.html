Subject: FS: VW Vanagon--$750

For sale: 1980 VW Vanagon, Westfalia
        
        Lots of miles (100K on odometer, driven for 8 out of 10 years
        since the odometer broke in 1987)

        Transmission work needed. Does not go except in reverse. To be
        honest, I don't know what kind of work it needs. Worst case would
        be a new tranny. I can't even afford to even have it looked at, so
        this could be a bargain opportunity for you. I have lots of bills
        to pay and can't give this car the attention it needs right now.

        Strong motor, recent head work (December, driven sparingly since
        April) and well maintained w/oil changes and such.
        
        New battery, Plenty of wear left on tires. 

        NICE Kenwood detatchable face stereo w/Pioneer speakers also
        available. I'd like to hold on to this, but it is currently
        installed in the car, so something could be negotiated. 

        This car has its share of idiosyncracies, but this is a soul car
        and sleeps four. Camper = good times. 

        I have two different roadside assistance plans, so I can probably 
        get the car towed a reasonable distance from where it is in Palo Alto. 

        Please reply by email
