Hi list,

	I'm, preping my bus for a trip to Alaska, and there are two things
that I would like to find:

	- roof rack,
	- and an engine tin.

	I have a 1974 VW Bus.  If I can't find either of those two things,
I'll either make on myself or get by without them ... but they would be
nice to have.

	Thanks much,

	  Wade
