Peter,
   Yep, the back drains dump on both sides of the engine compartment.
I ran some clear flex tubing from the outlets up above to drains that I
installed just aft of the tail lights. Keeps the water from just pooling
in there when the bus is just sitting,,,also keeps the drizzle off the
battery.

&gt; &gt;...I hand crafted a drain in the engine compartment because
&gt; &gt; my slider roof drain dumps water there. Turns out that this is right
&gt; &gt; where this short section of hose is too. Also, if I hadn't taken the
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; time to talk to the V-Dubber I would have just tooled on down the
&gt; &gt;  road without knowing a bad thing was brewing!

&gt; Daniel,
&gt; 	Is this where the slider is supposed to drain the water, 
&gt; or is it doing this because the other drains are clogged?  It must
&gt; also get the battery wet!  I have also noticed this with my slider.
