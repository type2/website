Subject: Diesel Conversions

Thanks for all of your replays.  I was aware that VW offered a diesel in
the early eighties.  I am looking at putting a 1.9L TD in my 82
Vanagon.  I may instead try a 1.6L turbo if that is easier to be had.
Both of these engines will put out the same hp or more than my existing
2.0L (from a '78 Bus no less). It looks like I am going to use the
conversion kit offered by FastForward_dot_ca.  Its a thousand bucks plus the
cost of the diesel motor.  They are running $3200 new complete for a
1.9L TD, but I am going to do a little research before I plunk down that
kind of cash.

I am not sure why one couldn't put one in a Bus, does the Vanagon tranny
fit in a Bus?  If it does that same conversion should work (probably
with some metal adjustment).

PS  If I do the conversion I will have a GD000861 Motor that runs very
well, compression is #1 - 127 psi, #2 - 125 psi, #3 - 120 psi, #4 - 125
psi, that I may want to sell.  It would be complete with a ne fuel pump
(Bosch), alternator, and ALL of the fuel injection.  Anyone know if
there is a market for this and how much is reasonable?  Thanks.
