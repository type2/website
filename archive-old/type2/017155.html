Subject: Re: Mark your campsite

I leave the cooler, the chairs, the kid, the dog, the shotgun.... If anyone
tries to take the cooler, the dog will get 'em. If anyone tries to take the
chairs, the kid will get 'em.  If anyone tries to take the kid,  he knows how
to use the shotgun.  If anyone tries to take the dog, they're meat. (Unless
they come armed with a Frisbee.)
