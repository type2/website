David,

How do I wire the cylinders against the case?  Does this require special
tools?  Or is it just regular wire?

I am inclined to believe that the heads are shot-the motor is original and
has 163.000 miles.  I am going to pull the valve covers first, because the
mechanics said the exhaust valve seat is visibly dropped-they can see it
with the covers off.  I also trust these guys, particulary because when I
told them I wanted to do the work myself to save money, they agreed and
said that they would do the same.  They are a couple of Czech guys that
probably have been working on aircooleds for 30 years.

I'm sure I'll have tons more questions as the moment of truth arrives. I'm
getting the heads from AVP.

Craig
