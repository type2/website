Subject: Might've found a MIG

Hi folks,

Now that I just &quot;alienated&quot; myself with my last post, I have a question.  I
have the opportunity to buy an off brand 110v mig welder with the gas tank
and regulator and a large spool of wire.  The brand/model name is &quot;Fro Baby
131&quot; (huh?) and the company that supposedly made them here in CT is now out
of business (unit is 8 years old, but guy says he only used it 3 or 4 times
for light duty jobs and has no use for a welder anymore).  He wants $150.

Now, if it works well as the guy claims--the only problem he reported was
the spool will sometimes get hung up and wire will come off it, preventing
the wire from feeding properly--this sounds like a correctible mechanical
problem, but I don't know, never having used one.

I've been hoping to get a good used Lincoln 110v welder, but it's difficult
to get a cheap price on one of these.  Since I won't be doing much welding
and I have the opportunity to get the whole shebang, tank, large spool of
wire, $150 seems like an affordable way to go.

Can anyone give advice on how I can best test this mig out when I go to look
at it to discover any common potential problems that would make this a bad
deal?   I've read the archives--especially the Century vs Lincoln model
debate.  Seems Lincoln is the better model, but for occasional use an
off-brand might not be so bad.  Any fresh comments on gas mig welding with
the off-brands (am I just asking for trouble with a capitol &quot;T&quot;)?
