Subject: RE: Timing Explanations

&gt;Or, let's say it this way...
&gt;12:00 on a clock is TDC.  3:00 would be 45 degrees BTDC, and 9:00 would 
be
&gt;45 degrees ATDC.  OR, if you like, 12:01 - 6:00 = BTDC and 6:01 - 11:59 
=
&gt;ATDC.  If you look
&gt;at the diagrams in Muir, it makes better sense.  This really is not 
that
&gt;complicated.

It's really not, but you've still got it backwards :-)  Just look at 
that timing scale -- if you speak German, you will see the words before 
and after printed on it :-)

Using your clock example (which is a good example, BTW, since it moves 
clockwise like the VW engine), we see 12:00 as TDC (top dead center). No 
problem.  Now if you want to try to tell me that 9:00 the previous hour 
comes BEFORE 3:00 the next hour, then I want to know what sort of time 
warp you are in.  The clock hands rotate in this order --&gt; 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 
- 5 - 6 - 7 - 8 - 9 - 10 - 11 - back to 12 again.

Say you are supposed to set your timing at 45 BTDC.  Well you know which 
way the clock rotates, right?  If you look at the clock you will clearly 
see that the hands come to 9:00 (45 degrees BTDC) BEFORE they come to 
TDC, hence this is BTDC.  You will also see that AFTER the hands pass 
TDC, they go to 3:00 (eventually) which is 45 degrees ATDC, because the 
hands get there AFTER TDC.  Seems pretty clear to me.  I hope you are 
not timing your engine based on your explanation :-)
