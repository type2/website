1971 Genuine Westfalia Camper, originaly purchased in Germany by Army
Colonel and brought back to US in 1975, I got this van from second owner
that was seduced by Cadillac air conditioning and also has his 75
ElDorado for sale.
PO claims less than 100K on the unit.. Really!
I has a new engine (less than 4,000 miles). I don't know the CC but it's
the original crankcase, crank etc. with a rebuild by specialty VW shop in
the Dallas area that has been in business for 40 years.
I'll post some pictures but this is a *project*  so don't expect anything
sparkling.
It has reasonably good body.
Rust around broken front windshield.
Rust around VW emblem on front.
Camping too close to tree small dents drivers side rear on corner.
Some bondo on the rear panels below the engine door at the lowest point.
Rear bumper in relaxed position from broken bracket.
This car drives and stops OK, you could buy it and drive it home.
Bad green second paint job.
Almost everything required on this van for restoration is cosmetic, it is
mechanically sound. Tires look new but they are four years old.
