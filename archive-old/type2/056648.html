Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

hi volks, i have a hole (about the size ofa car radio put on its side) in the
cover for the gas tank in front of the engine. i see 2 wires coming from there
and a cable. maybe some kind of curled metal thing in there. does anyone know
what this is for? im gonna guess a duct for warm air to the passenger area.
regards, marty :)
