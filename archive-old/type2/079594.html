Subject: Re: [T2] oil leak

[...]

Have you looked at/replaced the oil pressure light sending unit?
It is in front of the distributor. When it leaks, it appears to be a leak from
the oil cooler/#4 cylinder.....


&gt; HI Folks,
&gt; I have an oil leak coming down at the cylinder-head interface on
&gt; the number 4 cylinder.  It is a steady drip, clean unburned oil.  I pulled
&gt; the push rod tubes on that side and checked their seals and tube
&gt; integrity-all good.  The oil is coming from above the tubes. I pulled the
&gt; bottom and between cylinder tin and I can see oil on the sides of the fins
&gt; above. The engine isn't smoking, makes good power.  California emissions
&gt; cat exhaust, stock engine in 1983 vanagon.  Before the leak it used &lt;1qt
&gt; in 1000miles. jon
