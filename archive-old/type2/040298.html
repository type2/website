&gt; bus. During the course of the day I met all the neighbors. :-) We put a
&gt; petcock valve in the fuel line between the tank and the filter, and
&gt; changed the filter (piece o' cake with that valve in place).

Wish I had one of those a year ago... I was changing the fuel filter every
week cuz of mucho crud in tank.  Finally got a pair of needlenose vice-grip
pliers, which work nicely.

&gt; However -- and this is odd -- after we got the plugs back in, I did the
&gt; test where you pull the wires off the distributor one at a time to see
&gt; if the engine falters. The #2 plug did not, so that cylinder's not
&gt; pulling its weight.

Had the same experiece with my beetle.  Turned out the PO had put the wrong
freakin plug in there.  However, after changing it it still takes a little
revving to notice a significant change.  One suggestion, try a new plug.
Could be a buggered plug.
