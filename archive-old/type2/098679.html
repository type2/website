Subject: Re: [T2] Drivers door weight?

Hello,

I had 2 bus doors shiped to me from California and the
weight of each doo, if I am not mistaken is around
70lbs.  They are VERY cumbersome though. I used cinder
blocks under the bottom of the door with wood shims.
Loosen each bolt alittle at the time. Roll down the
window before you remove the last bolt. It makes it
easier to hold on to. Make sure you have a place all
ready to put it before you remove it.

Before you try to remove the bolts, check the archives
on the best way to remove them. I ruined the ones I
had and had to drill the heads off of them to remove
them. Good Luck!

 I don't have a helper to

&gt; thinking of building some kind of dolly to support
&gt; the door during
&gt; removal and install. Anyone out there know how much
&gt; the door weighs? Any
&gt; good ideas on supporting the thing while doing the
&gt; job alone?
