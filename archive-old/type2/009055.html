&gt;&gt;Hey gang,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I have a problem and would really like some of your sage wisdom:
&gt;
&gt;This is the blind leading the blind, but I'll try.
&gt;
&gt;As I said as I talked to you last week at the swap meet, I'm 

wondering if
&gt;it has something to do with the rubber hose and the sending unit 

being
&gt;mounted above your engine.  

Ding ding ding!  Sounds like a winner :-)
Was that important tidbit in the original message?

I would advise relocating the oil pressure sender so you are not 
experiencing oil starvation for 45 seconds (that's a LONG time) on 
startup.
