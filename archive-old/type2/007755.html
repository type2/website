&gt;Today I went out to start my 79 Westy, and when I turned the key, no start. 
&gt;Nothing else out of the ordinary occurred to indicate that the starter might
&gt;be bad, ie: the starter did not click, nor did the dash lights dim like it was
&gt;trying to kick over the starter.  I am thinking that it is the ignition switch
&gt;that exhibits these symptoms.  When I turned the key to the on position the
&gt;fuel pump kicked on, and when I turned the key to the start position, cut off,
&gt;as did the radio.  

It could also be a bad connection at the starter solenoid.  It would be worth
the time to crawl under and clean/inspect the connectors there.  Best to
disconnect the battery first to prevent sparks.  Also, I'm no expert on FI,
but there may be other things to look at as well, such as the double relay
on the (I believe) upper left of the firewall.
