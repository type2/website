&gt; &gt; To adjust the position of the steering wheel, change the length of
the tie
&gt; &gt; rods by turning the ends a bit, matching amounts on each side,
turn for
&gt; &gt; turn.  You might want to check toe-in using the Muir method.

Mark's method works fine for a beetle, but not for a bus, as most
buses (AFAIK) have an adjustable tie rod only on one side.

&gt; Because I knew the pitman arm was aligned correctly on the steering
box
&gt; shaft and that the steering wheel was correctly aligned when the box
was
&gt; at the middle of its range, I figured the adjustment point had to be
&gt; either in the drag link and/or the tie rods.  I adjusted the drag link
&gt; to center the steering wheel but when I tried turning the wheel
&gt; lock-to-lock, I noticed that turning left was limited by the box
travel,
&gt; turning right was limited by the wheel stop!  Tomorrow I'll return the
&gt; drag link to its original position and go to work on the tie rod
&gt; adjustment.

Bad news if the box is used as the limit for very long.  It's really
easy to chip the dowel pin, which will result in instant bad box.

My feeling is that you will have to pull the steering wheel to do this
right.
