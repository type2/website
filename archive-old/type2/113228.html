Subject: bn4

Still looking for picutre of wiring on a bn4 heater, I looked up the wiring 
in a repair manual that someone had put a web site for thanks, but the wiring 
shows a glow plug and a spark plug I beleive mine only has one, is it both in 
one. My main problem is the fan speed, it seems to be starting up fast, not 
changing at all, what controls this, does anyone have, a replacement flame 
detector, this might be faulty how do you check to see if it is, thanks dylan
