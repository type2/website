Subject: Re: [T2] Why Drive a Bus?

why drive anything else..........?
i would have 12 more if i could all diffrent types and years but only if they were daily drivers and not projects as my first was...~!~
if it wasnt for a couple of friends help.... well... this one wouldnt be a daily driver either....
 
funny thing i got 2 buicks both with a/c power windows and locks cruise control and nice soft interior....
my wife drives one of them the better but me i prefer to drive my bus anyday,., even if it is cold.. and i have no heat... 
loco i guess but just to be behind the wheel of a bus or at least my bus at 55 mph well enough said thats peace within its'self... funny thing i forget what people are looking at cause i am so comfortable while driving .. i forget sometimes that she is multicolored all the way around ...LOL..
 
have fun buy a bus, fix a bus, save a bus, build a bus... drive a bus....~!~
be free, be happy, be safe...
peace
Cha
