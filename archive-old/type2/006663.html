Subject: Re: [T2] Torquing Heads

Very interesting, maybe you should go teach the mechanic how to build an
engine, instead of reselling one........Undoubtedly , you are of higher
education than he, on the subject at hand

Subject: [T2] Torquing Heads


&gt;
&gt; So I'd pulled the engine on my '71 bus last week
&gt; thinking I was going to torque the heads as I have
&gt; roughly 550 miles on the engine now.
&gt;
&gt; Saturday morning I got a phone call from the guy I
&gt; bought the engine from and we're chit chatting when
&gt; I mention that I'm going to torque the heads this
&gt; weekend.  He says, &quot;I'm still not sure you need to
&gt; bother with that, but...&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Well, he called me back about 15 minutes later and
&gt; says that he just talked to the engine rebuilder
&gt; he got the engine from, who said something along the
&gt; lines of &quot;the heads that are on that engine are Aluminum
&gt; and shouldn't need to be torqued&quot;, in addition to that,
&gt; they are apparently torqued to 28 ft. lbs (as opposed
&gt; to the spec 22-23 ft. lbs specified by Bentley).
&gt;
&gt; Surely the engine builder, if he's worth his salt, has
&gt; some knowledge of what works and what doesn't work on
&gt; the engines he's building, but...I'm confused because:
&gt;
&gt; a) aren't all 1600 VW Cylinder Heads aluminum?
&gt;
&gt; b) what would make these heads so different that you'd torque
&gt; them to 5 ft lbs more than spec?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Anyone have any info on this?
&gt;
&gt; I'm headed up north of Reno next weekend and need to get
&gt; my engine back in relatively soon to make sure there
&gt; aren't any other bugs i need to work out before the
&gt; trip.  So, I'm inclined to re-torque the heads to spec
&gt; before the 1500 mile journey, but another part of me
&gt; says: Don't mess with head torque if it's working now
&gt; and you're about to put 1500 miles on the engine.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; tom
