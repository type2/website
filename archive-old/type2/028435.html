Importance: Normal

I have recently acquired a 77 Toyota land cruiser
and am in need of some parts. I am the owner and
operator
of www.BUStedVW_dot_com and would like to work a trade
deal for some land cruiser parts.

Does anyone have access to cruiser parts that they
would like to trade for vw bus parts.

BUStedVW is new to the type2 list and is working
on a discount for list member. We are dedicated to
offering affordable quality used parts to
1968-1979 Volkswagen Bus owners. We currently
stock thousands of hard to find used parts and add
newly available parts to our catalog daily. We can
guarantee this because we continually buy salvaged
buses and dismantling them for the parts you need.
We put the parts you need just a mouse click away
as we have already removed, cleaned, and inspected
each part to ensure its quality. Only parts that
pass inspections are added to the inventory and we
offer same day shipping on all our in stock items!
We are located in Beautiful Boulder, Colorado
