&gt; Mike Wright and I agreed perfectly about old tires, except where to put the
&gt; worst ones.  He says put the bad tires in back, I say front.  I think I
&gt; can control the car better steering one tire and one blownout rag, than I
&gt; can with the heavy back end trying to spin me into the oncoming lane.
&gt;
&gt; Hope I never get to test my opinion.  Anyone BTDT?
NO NO NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I have blown a rear tire, on my folks' pickup truck, and didn't even swerve.
However, I know a couple people that have blown front tires, and gone swerving
madly across several lanes of traffic. One was lucky, and didn't hit anything,
the other person lost control completely. Think about it this way- when you
lose a front tire, one wheel slows down VERY quickly, which really pulls hard.
If it's a rear tire, all the momentum will continue to drag it forward, as the
center of mass is in front of the tires. the wheel with the blown tire will
slow down drastically, which can't spin the rear of the vehicle.Also, rear
wheels are fixed facing forward, while front wheels are free to turn. I would
heartily recommend not using questionable tires at all, but if you must, I
would say definately on the rear.
