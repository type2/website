It is my week as list admin - I'm sorry I took so long to address this.

Whether all of you know it or not, the subject of this list's archives is
vital and at this particular moment in a major state of flux.  The archives
are a collection of high quality bus-related information covering a period
of about seven years which cannot be found anywhere else in the world.

Because of this, just this once I would like to make an exception and let
the people who have knowledge and *constructive* opinions about this
subject express them on the list.  Those of you who can't bear the noise
are free to unsubscribe and resubscribe in a week or two, assuming that the
list will still be around then.

If anyone feels like crucifying me for this, e-mail me privately at
sde_at_home_dot_com and we can talk it over.  Please keep in mind that the admins,
while they have their faults, are trying to help the type2 community the
best that they can.  If they get beaten on too hard one or all of them
could decide to throw in the towel as, unfortunately, Stephen G. has done
and this great resource we all know and love will be history.

-David
