Subject: Re: [T2] 009 timing

I have a 70 bus 1600sp .Also installed a 009 dist. Man at the shop
said to statically time it at 71/2 to 10 deg. BTDC. I did and it runs great.
Total advance is 28. Would like to know if this timing is correct. The 
old vac. adv. dist. set at 0 deg. Am very happy with this setting if it is
right. This is my first vw am new to this.
