Subject: Re: [T2] Re: AC in Southern Buses

From: &quot;Joe Clark&quot; &lt;jclark_at_supernet_dot_net&gt;
&gt; Never buy an argument that is presented as &quot;really that simple&quot;. :-)

Boy, you can write that again.

&gt; Then quoth David:
&gt; &gt; If by spoiled, you mean I desire to get where I'm going without smelling
funky, then yes, I'm spoiled.  :-)

I've lived in Georgia for 20+ years.  While I've sweated my share of days
away, I've always showered to clean up.  Sometimes twice a day if called
for.

&gt; It uses more gas and puts more heat in the environment, just to make you
feel better.  Oh, I use it, don't get me wrong.  I love it at home...

Ditto here, but I've also found ways to avoid using it until really, really
necessary.  In the summer, the power company raises the rates and my power
bill gets over $250.00 per month easily.  And we live in a 12' x 40' mobile
home.  I've known of folk with bills over $400.00.

There are countries where they've lived with and dealt with heat for 1000's
of years.  Marvolously ingenious devices that cool you off and don't eat
power.

But I really think with a bus, or any car really, it's a matter of luxury
vrs. need.  I'd like AC in my bus, but I'd rather have it in my home where I
can make the most use of it.  I'm 48 years old, so I can remember the many
cars on the road without AC, more so for my parents.  We all coped.  It's
not a necessity.

We're turning into a dainty bunch as a nation.  We easily forget how to cope
with basic things like heat or fixing our own meals (as opposed to
McDuffers).  You don't need AC in a bus (unless your handicapped and have to
have it no matter what you drive), but you &quot;want&quot; AC in a bus or a car.

&gt; But it ain't essential.  It's a luxury, and it comes with a price...
[Buses] have vent wings and fresh air vents.
&gt; All I'm saying is that it's a conscious decision to employ a luxury
appliance, not something that should be rationalized as essential.

I agree.  Toasty in the summer and frozen in the winter.  Gotta love having
a bus!

I live with enough stereotypes here in the South, please don't add &quot;sweaty
slob&quot; to the list!  Sweat dries, it showers off, you dress for the weather.
Don't put those of us who do without AC, or think it as a luxury, on some
sort of Neanderthaloid list!
