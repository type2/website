My original tubes had asbestos gaskets (well it sure looked like
asbestos anyway).  The new ones I installed a few months ago have a
piece of plastic instead.  Not sure what kind of plastic, looks like the
same kind as the tubes are made of.  I don't think it's melted yet, but
then my crappy heat exchangers wouldn't melt chocolate.

&gt; Question #2 The plastic accordion adapters from the heater control box
&gt; to the
&gt; heater tubes should have a metal spacer and a felt type gasket.  Where
&gt; can I
&gt; get them or what can I use as a substitute for this gasket?
