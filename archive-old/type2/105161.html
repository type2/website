&gt; I wonder if dielectric (100% silicone) grease would work as well as silicone

Seeing as how the purpose of dielectric grease is not lubrication, I don't
think that it would be optimum for this purpose.

 When you say silicone spray, do you mean those cans of silicone
&gt; lubricant that you see in the same isle as WD-40?

I'd go to a glass shop and see what they use.  They might even sell you
some!  :)
