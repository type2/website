Subject: Split:Windshield Rubber Comparison

Splitters:

Up there with what kind of tire and how do I get more heat and a
few other classic questions seems to be something along the lines
of:

Is WCM rubber better than RMMW or should I buy from Bus Boys
eventhough I never get their catalog or is there somewhere else
that sells better rubber for a split but I gotta know now because
I'm painting my bus and the windows leak and I'm leaving for
Seattle (or live there) and it's gonna get everything in my
parcel tray wet if the windshield leaks all over my collection of
bumper-stickers-du-jour which keeps the cops from searching my bus
when I weave all over the road because I'm going faster than
50mph?

Two methods of answering the question are 1) to wait for
VWperson_at_att_dot_com or VdoubleU_at_anywhere_dot_edu to give their opinion
of what they got or 2) watch for the latest sano-rad issue of
HVWs and find out what went into BongoBus on the Salt Flats and
do what they did.  I'm taking another approach and will,
eventually, share the knowledge with my friends in NEATO and you.

At 5:00 p.m. CST Friday, I sat down with the following catalogs:

Vintage VW Parts
Rocky Mountain Motor Works
Bus Boys
West Coast Metric

One after another I called each of them and placed an order for
two split-window bus windshield seals.  My plan is to have a
sample of each in front of me and do some analysis.  Granted,
just looking at and feeling eight pieces of rubber is not likely
to win me any prizes or allow a long-term evaluation of
durability of the materials.  I do, however, think the analytical
approach may put some questions to rest (at least until the next
Newbie).

Now before anyone tries to cheer my altruistic spirit, I have to
admit (or gloat) that I have three '67s and all need a change of
windshield rubber, so the worst I could end up with is an extra
set.  Optimistically, it could be for the next bus.  On the other
hand, maybe one of my &quot;stress tests&quot; during the comparison could
find one set very unworthy and then I'll (and you'll) know which
not to install.  If you'll bear with me (and UPS and OBR), I'll
provide some updates as things arrive and I can begin evaluation.

In the mean time (Isn't time always mean?) feel free to offer
your opinions on evaluation and testing criteria.  I don't intend
to become the Consumer Reports of old buses, it just seems like
$100 well spent and something I can pass along to others trying
to keep a box-on-wheels on the road.
