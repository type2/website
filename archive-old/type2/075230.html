Subject: Re: [T2] Engine dies when I  try to shift into reverse...Please help me



&gt; I doubt this would be the problem, because the coil simply provides juice
to
&gt; the backup lights.  Good call on a possible problem though.  If the backup
&gt; light wire is grounded somewhere, then that would be a problem.
&gt;

Oh but it will (hooking the reverse lights up to the wrong side of the
coil).  Ask me how I know :-)
Reason is because in order to make a spark the coil needs to have an
interrupted ground which is controlled by the points.

If you hook the reverse light circuit up to the wrong side of the coil, when
you shift into reverse you are basically providing a direct path to ground
and therefore no spark, therefore engine no run.
