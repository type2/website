Subject: Re: where not to go to get your front end alignment.

&gt;ive tried toe in, and never had any luck with it myself. i feel like its a
&gt;job left to the folx w/ computors. I usually start looking for coupons about

Every two months or so my local VW dealer sends out discount coupons for
service and parts (10% off--which is what CT VW Assoc. Club membership also
gets you at this dealership).  I tried to get my bus aligned on one of their
$25 front end alignment coupons---unfortunately their alignment rack bay
won't accomodate vans (?? but they sell vans ??) and the coupon is only good
for cars.  They farm out their other alignment work to Town Fair Tire.

I'm tempted to bring the bus in for alignment at another VW/Jaguar/etc.
dealership that's local.  What's keeping me away is the cost--$60.  I saw
their work area a few years ago.  You could really eat off the floors.  I
can just see the mechanics scrambling under my bus with diapers trying to
catch oil drips--might be worth the $60 just to watch that...
