He was here too. He is ahead of schedule on his trip home.

I have met Steve several times at campouts, but having him in my home for
the night was a real treat. He kept my kids spellbound with the fossil he
brought, his explanation of the earth's history, and his discussion of his
faith to my Baptist kids. We stayed up late talking (VW and non-VW). I hope
he comes back. He is a real friend.

We met up with Dave Jersey this morning, then he was on his way to W
Virginia and points north.
