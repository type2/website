5 year old I'm not willing to take the same chances.......

My now 17 yr old daughter literally grew up with our 78 Westy, bought
when she was a year old, and we still camp in it. Now she drives her own
1975 bus, and I am more concerned about her novice driving skills than
her bus safety. Luckily, NJ allows new licensees only one nonrelated
passenger their first year of driving. I teach her defensive driving,
never to make assumptions, and be predictable.  
    Back in 1986 I thought she was relatively safe in her toddler seat
belted into the middle of the rear seat.  Yes it is relative; being a
bicyclist, I believe 50% of safety is BEING NOTICED by others, and the
Westy is more imposing at a distance than a new beetle.  At night, If I
had to go 15 mph below the posted limit, I'd use the flashers.  Last
year we &quot;sagged&quot; for a bicylist doing a 300mi trip across Pa in less
than 24 hrs, requiring us to travel an average speed of 18-20 mph, 5 hrs
of it in the dark.  We had to drive behind him so he could use our
headlights.  Got a few xenon strobe lights at Radio Shack; they have
ankle straps and are a superbright White- one went on the bicyclist, and
two went on the rear of the Van, surrounding a sign denoting &quot;Bicyclist
Sag Wagon&quot;.  I assure you following traffic gave us a wide berth!
