Subject: RE: [T2] Which is right or left?

&lt;&lt; Depends if you are on the lee side or not..... &gt;&gt;

Not me...I'm from NJ, one of the Blue (Union) states... ;-)

---------------------------------------------
Lee was plenty blue prior to 1861, and would have probably remained blue had
the federal army not marched on his home state of Virginia.  I guess the
real question is what model year of bus would Robert E. Lee had driven if
they were available back then.  Sidewall rating would have been a moot point
and of course interchangeability of parts would have been a nightmare.
Whitney's process wasn't completely solid yet in those years,.. unless of
course his bus had a cotton gin in it.....
