&lt;&lt;Hey everyone. I just bought a 76 Westy delux and I can't make the sink
work. It looks as though it should. The fuse is fine..wiring looks
good, but the sink pump just won't turn on. I'm pretty sure it is not
the switch..it seems to be working. Any ideas?
Email me directly if you have any suggestions.

Thanks,

You didn't mention if you had voltage at the pump.  You need a voltage meter, 
or at least one of those cheap test probes that light up when you touch the 
pointed end on your hot lead.  Put the clip end on a good ground.  Find an 
unpainted surface on the body to clip it to.  Untwist the fuse holder and 
remove the fuse.  Stick the test lead up into the fuse holder and touch the 
metal surface.  Make sure you  check the end of the fuse holder that is no 
longer connected to the pump.

If your light goes on, you have power.  If not, you need to trace the wire 
back to find the problem.

If you do have power, your pump or switch could be bad.

P-mail if you need any other help.
