Another reason not to do it is the fact that it is probably illeagal, it
would be here.

&gt; Don't do it!  I appreciate your ambition to demonstrate fire safety 
&gt; and all
&gt; that, but there aren't enough to go around to be torching drivable 
&gt; buses, no
&gt; matter what the cost.  What will you have left when you're done: 
&gt; another
&gt; charred piece of metal and a bus gone to waste.  The lesson's 
&gt; valuable, but
&gt; maybe there's another way?
