Subject: Re: How one thing just leads to another...

I had that problem too with my fuel tank.  Pretty interesting because my
bus leaked gas like a madman.  And that was all it was, weird.  Of course
my connection was completely rotted off, pretty much.  I could only put a
half tank in, so when I eventually got the engine all out and saw that, I
couldn't believe that that was the only thing wrong.  I eventually took
the fuel tank out and put another one in it I had, just to be sure, ya
know don't want to put it all back in and then find out that it was
something else.  I just went to a hardware store and rigged up some
hosing.  Bad thing it, it's probably metric.  I got 1/2&quot; hosing, but it
was just a bit too small, so if you can try to find like 13 mm hosing you
can easily rig it up.  I managed to get the 1/2&quot; on, but it was
difficult.  Thankfully now I can put a full tank in and it not slosh out.
 My fuel gauge still doesn't work right, sometimes it will jump up, but
mostly it just doesn't move at all.  Oh well, sounds like wiring to me.
