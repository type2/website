Subject: Re: [T2] New Bus owner need help identifying part

I live in washington state for now so emissions aren't of any concern from
a legal standpoint(I still care about the environment tho).

My main concerns at this point are restoring the mechanical/operational
condition and upgrading to newer(hopefully better) parts in the process.
Since this bus will be travelling to remote locations fairly often I want
to make sure that it is in tiptop shape and will return me from wherever I
decide to go.

I understand that holes in this part could cause the engine to run
lean(thanks Karl).  That being said Karl also stated that it could cause a
vacuum leak as well.  If I am not mistaken the brake servo operates off
the vaccuum system does it not?  If my brake servo doesn't work, couldn't
this be part of the problem?  I know I am kind of beating the brake servo
thing to death, but its one of my main goals, that and solving my starting
problem(which I believe is related to the hot start problem these tend to
have and I have already purchased the relay kit)

Thanks again for the info!
