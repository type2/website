&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; I know a fellow that is selling a 1961 Westy up here near Toronto.
&gt; 
&gt; The interior is basically missing except for the cabinet in the rear corner
&gt; of the pass. side of the van, and it has the two curved pieces of birch
&gt; that go in the rear corners of the van. It does have the submarine hatch as
&gt; well. Basically it is missing the entire so-23 interior except for the
&gt; pieces I have mentioned.

&gt; The guy wants to get ~$4500 CDN for it ($0.75 CDN = $1.00 US) which IMHO is
&gt; far too steep. I told him I would post it, e-mail me if you are interested
&gt; in it and I can get you more details. Usual disclaimers apply, just apssing
&gt; this along.

Doesn't sound like a Westy to me, but what would I know?

I've got a '61 Weekender??? That's what I was told it was, anyhow. I
purchased it for the unGodly sum of $100 about 2 weeks back. The
interior and exterior are complete, if not a little beat up. Bed is
there and working, the cabinets are all there (only in the rear of the
van), and though the seats are out of a Dasher (I think), it's all
original, except for the Safari Rear Window. The 40-horse is present in
body, but mind-wise - it's questionable. After pulling it out, I noticed
that the clunk I wass hearing whilst trying to turn it over was the
sound of a connecting rod sticking out of the case at an angle (with
much torn and broken metal to boot). Now, I'm just guessing, but I've
been told by most ppl that there's not a lot of hope for the motor.

I know little to nothing about busses. I've had 5 bugs, all from the
early to mid 70s. The motors are the same, but is messing with the motor
worth it? Should I find a dual port somewhere? Will it simply pop into a
stock 6V system? Do I need to mess with the Flywheel or housing
thereabouts?

While I'm on the question route, does anyone have ideas about good
places to start looking for parts (both interior and exterior) to clean
it up a little? I know they make replacement door panels and such - do
they make entire interior panels for the rear? The back, wrap around
panels are in good shape, and I can re-build the cabinets sufficiently,
but...

Jees, I guess I'm getting carried away. What was I saying? (scroll,
scroll) Oh, I remember. Is a Weekender what this is? Or is it a partial
Westy?

Thanks for my time,
