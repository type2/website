Subject: Fried distributor wire

To the person with the melted distributor wire: I think 
the green wire coming from the points in the distributor 
was connected to the terminal of your coil that also had 
the black power wire going to it. 

The terminals on a Bosch coil are marked + and/or 15 
and the other one - and/or 1. 

The green wire from the points must go to the - or 1.

The black wire coming from the wiring loom must go to 
the + or 15 terminal. The black wires going to the 
electric choke(s) and idle cut-off valve(s) should 
also be connected to this terminal. There may also be 
a wire on there going to a back-up light switch on the 
transmission. 

There may be more wires connected to the coil if your 
VW is newer than, say, '69 or so. These are for VW 
diagostic equipment. While it's nice to leave them 
intact on a concours vehicle, they are not necessary 
for normal operation. 

Brian
