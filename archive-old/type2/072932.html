I ran yet another outrageous idea, past some folks on the type 2 chat last
night and they thought it was a fair one, but it is also a young one and
not thoroughly discussed yet.  I will now run it by ya'll for
consideration.  Considor it, think about it, and write me back.  I will
compile and report on the outcomes and possibilities.

I hereby propose for consideration:  The First Annual Type2 Cross-Country
Buslist Member Relay

Date: Undetermined

Description as my jumbled mind sees it:

A bus (Loaf or split) would leave an east coast city and head West on a
specified route.  At the same time a Split or loaf would leave a west cost
city and head east.  They would carry a VW Emblem as a baton to be passed
off to other list members at rendevous points across the country.

No list member would be able to carry both batons.  We would have the
eastern team and the western team.  both teams or representatives of would
meet at the Josh Rogers Memorial Beer and Bus Campout in Oklahoma.

Segments would be any length over 150 miles.  That would make the segments
between each baton pass around two to three hours long according to terrain
and other factors, like failing points, flats...etc....

The Relay wouldn't have to be done constantly, just so the travel times are
accurately recorded.  When one list member passes the baton the recieving
list member would then post a note to the list his route and time after the
leg is completed.  The first to arrive is not at issue here, but travel
times are.  Of course we would need to make it as short as possible, I
wouldn't want to have one ending in a month and the other coming in in Y2K.

Rules:
All drivers would have to follow the stated speed limit signs except where
the open road allows some flexibility to feel radical (safety and
completion is the priority),  wear seat belts, helmets (doesn't mater what
kind, be creative, football will do fine).

It would take a lot of organization, but it could be done.  It would be fun
and would promote the driving of our busses.  We might could even get
sponsors.  Plus there might would be Exclusive participant T shirts
involved.  As if we didn't already have plenty of them.  : )

Anyway, I know it sounds outlandish and rather difficult but it would damn
sure fun to try it.

Shoot it down if you must, but be gentle and don't cuss me.  : )  I am only
thinking here and we all know how dangerous that can be.

The AIRS site is right now a work in progress so be patient, it is still on
the way.
