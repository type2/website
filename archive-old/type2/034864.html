Volks,
   I just found a Z bed at Bry's in Seattle. It needs some TLC but I
got it for $60.00 so what the heck. I have it in pieces at the moment
having cleaned and repainted the hardware and refaced the cabinet etc
etc.
 On the hardware there is a spring loaded ratcheting type bar... one on
each side. Both are broken. What do they do? Also are they really
needed? 
  In closeing... I kind of like the buses 1974 - 1979...  so tell me
why should friends not let friends buy them? HHmm?
