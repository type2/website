Subject: 1979 Vw Westi Camper

This is a 1979 VW Westi camper pop top . Inside there is a working sink ,
interior camping light , and electrical outlets . The Motor is a 2.0L fuel
Injected type 4 . The transmission is an automatic . One the van it has new
tires , new front brakes , new alternator and voltage regulator , new fuel
pump and filter , all new fuel delivery hoses , battery is 1 year old . Also a
new transmission pan gasket and filter . The Motor has over 120,000 miles on
it , the rings are bad and it leaks oil . The compression is blowing by the
pistons causing the oil pressure to be TOO high . I drive it about 3 times a
week , SHORT TRIPS . The motor needs to be rebuilt , but the transmission is
very strong . The exterior was painted dark blue with a black stripe before I
bought it . There is only 2 dents , and NO rust . I live in Atlanta Ga. . The
price is 600.00 , it's worth more than that even if it didn't even run .
Thanks .
