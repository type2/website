Hmm, this is interesting.  Mine don't wobble when on the road, maybe because
I haven't abused them enough yet.  Perhaps I'll be repairing them in a few
years, but I just can't deal with a bunch of overheated little kids in the
back of my bus.  Even with this new information, I'm sure I'd never be able
to prevail upon my wife to leave them closed in the summer.  The great
airflow is one of its best features.  And the ability to repair stuff is one
of mine.

&gt; YES!! there is a big problem with this, it ruins the opening mechanism and
will
&gt; make the windows unusable , they will not close tight and when trying to
open
&gt; them the gears will start slipping.. a big problem with old cars is most
people
&gt; don't have the owners manuals anymore, especially westy manuals, the
manuals
&gt; tell you not do this and why and i know the result from first hand
experience
&gt; (wish i'd found a manual sooner :)
&gt; as the parts for the jalousie (sp?) are not available outside of junkyards
&gt; (eagerly corrected on this ) its a good idea to do as the manufacturer
&gt; recommends to preserve them, as  i know, it stinks to have a non
functional
&gt; window that won't seal up tight or open all the way.
&gt; hope i save some people (and buses) some future frustration
