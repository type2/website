After removing the valve cover/s, you turn the engine over and check the
valve travel. I normally lay under the van and roll it back and forth in
second gear (without spark plugs, makes it easier) while I'm looking
right at the rocker arm assembly. You can pretty much tell about the
valve travel or visually see less travel or gapping between the valve
stem and the rocker arm. You can also detect bent rocker arms and
backed-off rocker adjusting screws at the same time.

Sometimes the rocker arm will be loose since the valve is standing off on
a seat that is out of it's pocket.
Other times you look for a bent pushrod or collapsed lifter. I guess you
could make some kind of gauge out of heavy paper or use a ruler with a
measurement from a knon to be good intake valve.

A compression test will normally tell you if you've got a compression
leak but on rare occasions (like mine) the seat can drop back in the
pocket and you'll read compression,(although it would be low) it's only
when the engine starts that the seat starts to float out of the pocket.

You could also rotate the engine to both valve closed position
(compression stroke) for the cylinder you want to check and put
compressed air into the cylinder through the spark plug hole and hear the
hissing sound as the air blows by the loose valve seat.

I've been told that the 3-4 bank normally runs hotter than the 1-2 bank,
but I have no proof. Every thing looked pretty much equal on a 90,000
mile engine I recently tore down it had the same ring wear, same spark
plug coloration, same amount of carbon build up on piston tops, cylinder
heads and valve back-sides.

&gt; What does one look for in this procedure???
