Subject: Re: [T2] Headlamp dimming-relay: NO FLASHER in USA &amp; Canada !

YES what parts do you want,  I have always wanted to be able to flash my
headlamps like I did in Europe....
   
   Wonder if the wiring is all there or if I'll have to use the Haynes
wiring diagram and wire em up???

Thanks

&gt; Browsing recently through the electrical circuit diagrams, in my Robert 
&gt; Bentley and Haynes manuals for the 1968~79 VW Type 2 and 1968~75 VW Type 4, 
&gt; I noticed that the headlamp dimming-relay for the USA (and also Canadian 
&gt; presumably) specification vehicles, only has 4 terminals.
&gt; 
&gt; In Great Britain and Europe, the headlamp dimmer-relay has an extra terminal 
&gt; labelled 30, which is connected by a 2.5 mm2 cable, to an unfused battery 
&gt; supply (same fusebox terminal as the red/white 6.0 mm2 cable from the 
&gt; battery).
&gt; 
&gt; This enables we British to flash our headlamps, without first turning on the 
&gt; headlamps, at the main dashboard lighting switch!
&gt; 
&gt; Formally, flashing headlamps has the same meaning as sounding the horn; 
&gt; warning people of one's presence. Informally, it is used to acknowledge a 
&gt; courtesy from other drivers and lorry drivers commonly flash their headlamps 
&gt; to say it's okay to pull in front of them, following an overtaking 
&gt; manouevre. Owners of air-cooled VWs, also do it in greeting to one another, 
&gt; in Great Britain!
&gt; 
&gt; I discovered this difference, whilst sorting out a revised headlamp circuit, 
&gt; for a fellow VW Type 2 listee, in California, USA. I devised the circuit 
&gt; sometime ago, to enable the use of H4 100/55W, 100/80W, 130/90W or 160/100W 
&gt; quartz halogen headlamp bulbs (both p43t and P45t flanges), on my British 
&gt; specification 1973 VW 1600 Type 2, without suffering excessive voltage 
&gt; losses or overloading the standard wiring cables, ignition switch, dashboard 
&gt; lighting switch or headlamp dimming-relay.
&gt; 
&gt; The British &amp; European specification, 5-terminal headlamp dimmer-relay, used 
&gt; for 1971~79 VW Type 2, post-1967 VW Type 1 and post-1970 VW Types 3 &amp; 4, has 
&gt; VW Part No. 411 941 583B.
&gt; 
&gt; I have a few spares, if anyone wants to trade for some USA specification, 
&gt; featherweight second-hand, air-cooled VW components, which I seek for my 
&gt; 1973 Westfalia Continental.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards.
