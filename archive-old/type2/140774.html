Subject: Re: [T2] Why not to live in pretentious neighborhoods

Forget the fart cans!

They want to play by the rules and call the cops well two can play that
game. Just get a really loud boom box and a copy of  Black Sabbath's
&quot;Paranoid&quot; CD and crank it up super loud while working on the bus! LOL

Promptly shut it all down a 10 o'clock and call it a night.

I'm sure they'll love songs like &quot;War Pigs&quot;, &quot;Paranoid&quot;, &quot;Iron Man&quot;, etc.
and my two favorites &quot;Hand of Doom&quot; and &quot;Electric funeral&quot;!

&quot;What cha gonna do, times cuaght up with you, now you wait your turn, you
know theres no return!&quot;

&quot;Reflex in the sky, warn you you're gonna die, storm coming you'd better
hide, from the atomic tide, flashes in the sky turns houses into sties,
turns people into clay, radiation minds decay...&quot;

wa wa wawawa waaa wa wawa... LOL

And be sure to zone out and wander around the driveway playing air guitar
during you cigerette breaks. Talking to your wife about working on the bus
will likely be pretty far down on their list of complaints at that point.
