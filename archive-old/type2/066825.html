Subject: RE: Heat exchanger paint/Por-20 (Long)

FWIW, I've never had a problem with rusting heat exchangers. That is to say 
yeah, sure they rust, but so do all exhaust components. Buy Brazilian 
exchangers (I'm talking 1600cc here) and they'll be gone in a year. But 
about two years ago I put new German exchangers on my bug, and they now have 
a bit of surface rust on them, but no signs of rusting through. (I live in 
the the Midwest.) Same principle applies to mufflers. You get what you pay 
for.

It would seem to me that painting an exhaust is only something to be done to 

a brand new box, AFTER removing all the primer (other wise the primer will
burn
taking the outer paint with it).

The alternative is a nice Stainless Steel box, I can give any one interested
the name and address that I got mine from. They do them for 1.6 and 1.7 to
2.0
engines. Cost for my 1.6 was 100 UK pounds ($150 US) plus sales tax and
carriage.
