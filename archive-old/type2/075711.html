Subject: Re: [T2] 75 bus fuel injection ? stalls at idle

And just to follow up... Bob is correct.  Air leaks can cause big
problems!  Especially with FI, if you have an air leak after the airflow
meter, that means that the air entering the system has not been
accounted for.  In turn, the flap inside the airflow meter is not
deflecting as much as it should, and makes the computer send less gas
through the injectors...

later,
Mike
