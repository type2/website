Subject: Re: Longblock needed, Wilson NC

Also, Chris has funds, just needs the longblock, although I'm sure  he'd
appreciate
some help installing it.



&quot;I'm posting for this Chris Sheridan, type 2 list member who has broke
down in Wilson, NC. He needs a 1600 DP long block, (used or rebuilt).
He'll be checking a wrecking yard tomorrow for one, if anyone in the
area has one, or a lead on one , call Chris at 252-234-2900 room 119.&quot;
