&gt;hello,
&gt;      I have been a lurker on the list for about two
&gt;years. I am having trouble finding a part. It is the
&gt;forked shaft that works as a release bar for the
&gt;clutch on my 71 bus.

I had a HELL of a time finding one a few months ago,
when I was in desperate need of one.  I was told that
the after-market ones were............er........lacking in quality.
I wound up getting a used, but worn, one from Ken at
The Bus Co., and having the worn surfaces built up with
weld, and reground to new spec.  Gene Berg has the
bushing kits.
