Subject: Re: door handle

I just went through this on The List! Since you have a 71 and the spice
cabinet is in the way of the inside sliding door handle when you close
the door from the inside (68-74), you're looking for a double-ended
handle for that. Some kind person -- I forget who but hopefully they'll
come forward -- has pictures of that handle. They're *really* hard to
find and I'm trying to talk somebody into fabricating replacements.
Anybody? Anybody?

Also, I'm not sure if the 71s have the &quot;silent closing&quot; handle towards
the rear of the inside of the sliding door, but I think that's just a
standard inside door handle. Anybody? Anybody?

&gt; Does anyone have a picture of the interior door handle on their web page??
&gt; I have an older bus and have no clue that the newer ones had it.
