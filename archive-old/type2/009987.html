Subject: 12 point bolts &amp; heater boxes
Message-ID: &lt;19990628.102908.118.0.jackhope_at_juno_dot_com&gt;

Hello everyone.

I am in the middle of a complete enginge rebuild on my '74 1800cc westy
and I am at a crossroads.

First of all, does anyone know where I could purchase the 12-point bolts
connecting the pressure plate to flywheel.  I've called a couple of 
different places, and no one seems to have them.

Also, my heater boxes are thrashed, so I want some suggestions.  The
cheapest I have found them is for roughly $200 a piece, but I am not
really in a position to buy them right now.  If someone knows a cheaper
place to find them, that would be great, but I was wondering what
people's opinions were on replacing the boxes with extractors/headers,
and use a gas heater instead.  I will need heat for the bus, because I
live in Kansas and I do want to camp in the thing.

I will probably not need the heat until fall, so if this is something
that I could wait on, that would be good, however I DO NOT want to have
to take the engine out again, so I will probably have to do all of this
now.  It's been so long since I took the engine out of the bus initially,
I can't remember how hard the heater box removal was.

All perspectives are welcome.  All options will be entertained.  In the
end, I want to do the right thing.

Thanks is advance,

Jack
