Subject: Stuck nuts idea
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Here's my contribution, got it from a GM pipefitter.  Stuck nuts (and
bleeder screws) that resist heat, vibration and Liquid Wrench will often
succumb to moderate heat, then a touch of parafin to the joint between the
nut and the stud (or where the bleeder screws enters the casting).  The wax
is sucked into the joint like solder into a copper plumbing fitting, and the
bond is thereby lubricated.  I tried it on my drums, and it worked great.
Nothing else did.  Score one for skilled trades.
