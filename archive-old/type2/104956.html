Jennifer,

Is this the westy you are talking about, I looked at it the other day and 
the people at the used car dealer said it wasn't for sale and someone was 
going to use it as a parts bus.

If you are talking about another bus I'd be very interested to learn of 
where it's at.

&gt;Hi All,
&gt;
&gt;I found a 66 split window pop-top bus for sale here in LaVergne, TN.  They
&gt;want $400.  It has no engine or transmission  and probably missing some
&gt;suspension in back and has quite a bit of rust underneith.  The nose is 
&gt;good,
&gt;has both bumpers, interior, all glass.  The body does not look dented much 
&gt;-
&gt;just rust near the bottom.  Too much work for me, but it is cute and should
&gt;be saved.  I'd think they'd take less as it has sat there for a while.
&gt;Anyway, although not a bay, it's a type 2.  email me and I'll send you
&gt;directions to go look at it.
&gt;
&gt;Take Care,
&gt;Jennifer
