&gt; It sounds like the screw driver will get you going for a shirt while. If

&gt; It seems to me that worse comes to worse you could take the lock mechanism
&gt; apart piece by piece and try to get a good grip on the key.  In case you
&gt; didn't know there are instructions floating around the net explaining the
&gt; procedure.

a long thin hemostat will get down in there and if your lucky you will be
able to grab the key remains....a good medical supply store should have
what you need, less than $20 and you will have a tool that will last a
long time, I have several and use them all the time
