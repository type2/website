Mine is Muir 25th edition Feb 97. I would ask a good parts supplier like 
Strano's Foreign Car 814-849-3131.

&gt;for real? i was just discussing putting a 78 / 2.0L in my up-to-this-point
&gt;stock 75. then i cracked muir (jan. 1991; 14th ed.) and found it doesn't
&gt;have 435 pages. is this written in a newer edition muir...?   - steve
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Hi Volks,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;In my Muir Book Chapter XX page 435, co-authors John Hilgert and Peter
&gt; &gt;Achwanden discuss a problem with a 75 transmission in a 78 bus. Oil seal
&gt; &gt;failures along with pilot shaft bearing  failure. Cause was ìthe pilot 
&gt;shaft
&gt; &gt;on a ë75 is too short for a ë78 only a ë76 to ë78 will work.î
&gt; &gt;Also somewhere I read that optimum valve size for FI and Carbs are not 
&gt;the
&gt; &gt;same.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Good luck.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Chuck Watson
