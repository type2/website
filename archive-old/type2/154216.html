Subject: Re: [T2] How do I mount this thing???

sounds like a really common occurrence - I heard of a guy whose bus got 
struck by lightening .. fortunately his bus was perpendicular to the earth 
and not parallel .. so the spare effectively insulated him and his family 
...

jdd

&gt; and the other side of the story, I had a tractor trailer clip me (driver
&gt; fell asleep at the wheel) spun me sideways into his trailer, the spare on
&gt; the front of my bus hit his wheel and kept me from getting close enough
&gt; for the box to actually hit my bus, I was pushed away and had some
&gt; relatively minor damage, at 55mph. I think if the spare wasn't there I
&gt; would have hit him broadside with the front of the bus since the bumper
