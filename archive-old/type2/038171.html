Dear Folks,

Why don't we slow this thing down until we decide what to do? It looks like
Leo has abandoned the project. I wrote him about the web site a few months
ago and got no reply, so now I'm kind of worried that something may have
happened to Leo. I hope he's just busy and I hope that this suggestion
will/would meet with his approval.

I know that Leo was adamant about letting as many people as wanted to
participate do so. All he asked was that you take the time to sign up so
each person in the chain would know who to hand off to. Without some kind of
organization the whole thing falls apart as we have seen here. We could pick
up where he left off, using the list of drivers he already has and allowing
those folks who want to get in on the act sign up, just like before.

This means that someone or a bunch of someones need to get the drivers list
organized and keep the participants in touch with one another. I don't know
if there is room on the type two web site for this or even if the list would
be interested in working on this, but I wouldn't mind pitching in and
helping out by setting up and maintaining a web page for the Tour if I could
get some other people to help with the updates and posting of the logs and
pictures.

I'm heading out to Everybus tomorrow morning and won't be back until after
the weekend, but if anyone is interested they can p-mail me and if everyone
is okay with the idea of giving the tour over to a committee we can get
started to get this thing back on track.

Let me know what you think.

Chris and Gus the &quot;Ja, we can do that&quot; Bus in Atlanta
