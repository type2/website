Subject: Re: [T2] Re: engine conversion


&gt;simplicity of the 1600 engine, and I am beginning to see the advantages of
&gt;traveling light, rather than having all that kitchen equipment with you,
&gt;everywhere you go..  Jan B


I have to agree with Janice on this one :^)  My '70 putts around quite well 
with the 1600.  It wouldn't fare too well if it were loaded with camping 
gear year round.  I throw the added camping stuff in once or twice a year, 
and limit the abuse to my drivetrain(even with the  091).

Happy Friday!

	Eron
