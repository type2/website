Subject: also under my dash...

Also while I was under my dash I located some soft and hard plubming bits 
and what appears to be a refrigerant thermostat behind the passenger side 
kick panel.  The plubming goes back to the driver side of the engine 
compartment, under the floor.  Since I don't have the original engine and 
there's no vents or control box anywhere to be found, is there a build sheet 
or something that could tell me what these parts might have been for?  The 
plumbing passes through the floor support &quot;bulkheads&quot; very neatly through 
lined holes and looks to be factory (or perhaps Westfalia) installed.
