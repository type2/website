Subject: Flooding?

Have been encountering &quot;hard starting&quot; in my bus since its winter siesta.
Went to check the valves tonight and about a good cupful of gas poured out
of each valve cover after I pulled them off!   Is this just the result of a
flooded engine or do I have a serious carb problem?  It's a '711600dp with
a Solex.

Thanks
