Subject: head temp sensor hole

http://www.volks-web_dot_net/bus/MVC-225F.JPG
http://www.volks-web_dot_net/bus/MVC-226F.JPG

Situation:

Head temp sensor currently on #2.  The pics above are of the hole at #3. 
  I can't see it in the bus, so took a few pics.  Are these threads munged?

I think I'll try a little copper brush twirled in there, then some 
contact cleaner to flush out anything, then try to thread the OLD sensor 
in.  If it doesn't get munged, I'll try the new one there.

Good plan or bad?

Thanks!

Teri
