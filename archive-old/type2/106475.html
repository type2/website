&gt;thanks for the replys so far, I think solid lifters is where I will start,

Okay.  Don't forget to check them with every oil change.

&gt;maybe stick with the 94mm, but I was talking to a guy at fast auto today and 
&gt;he said 96mm with a strocker crank were the way for power, he said cams just 
&gt;give you a different power curve. I want smooth power through out but good 
&gt;power, no overheating problems, and not to much work.

Not sure I understand what you mean by &quot;not too much work&quot;.  Engine building is an art form and the &quot;perfect motor&quot; will take some research, and lots of money and time.  Yes increasing displacement with larger bore or stroke will give you more power, but it's not that simple.  Despite what the guy at Fast Auto told you, the camshaft is critical.

&gt; If I use a strocker 
&gt;crank how much clearancing will be needed and is this something to do at 
&gt;homeshop or send out.

If you have a builder you trust, I'd leave this job to them.  On the other hand if you are proficient with a die grinder and have lots of time, you could do it yourself.

&gt; If I were to go with a cam what is suggested and who 
&gt;carries it.

elgincams_dot_com and webcamshafts_dot_com are good places to start.  Tell them what you want and use what they recommend, not what the guy at Fast Auto tells you.
