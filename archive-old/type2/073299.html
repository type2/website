hollie e. butler may have written:
&gt;But I don't trust the
&gt;brakes really, just because of the noise, not because they seem to give out
&gt;or anything like that.

REMEMBER YOU SAID &quot;I always do what my gut says. My gut is ALWAYS right.&quot;
It is hard and unpleasant to drive when you have your gut in a knot.

&gt;I got one yesterday. Two to be exact. [heavy duty floor jack]
&gt;I also spent about $117 on the Phase One Tools.

The great thing about breaks is there is a setup on both sides of the car.
Lift the frontend (losen the lug nuts first) Rotate the weels by hand and
listen. Pull the weels and take a look. You will know more. Your gut will
smile.

&gt;Something else non-technical is that it just runs loud and &quot;knocky&quot;.
&gt;I think this is where the tune-up comes in.

Yes. Also holes in exhaust can change a purr to a growl.

&gt;Tomorrow I'm buying the idiot's guide, and calling a mechanic to see if he
&gt;can check it over for me.

I just got a '78 and the iGuide, I think the guide is better for an older
VW. I mean for repair, but it is a must read.


&gt;The only glitch is that now I don't know how to get the battery back in.
&gt;The question is, re-connect the negative side first or positive?

Removal -- Ground first(off)
Install -- Ground last(on)
