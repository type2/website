Volks,
   I need some help in finding a sun roof skin for my '79 bus. Mine is been
damaged severely and I need a replacement soon. I been to some places
locally (San Diego) and had bad luck. I know its going to be hard, however I
am sure that somebody might have one or know of somebody that does have one.
I will even pay for shipping from overseas. Any information will be greatly
appreciated.

Brad
