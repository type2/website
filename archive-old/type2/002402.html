As a reply to Paul's question about Jasco. I think that's the stuff I used to
prep for painting Otis, http://members.home_dot_net/jplusby/ for the resto story. If
that's the stuff, it was not a replacement for POR-15 because it was basically a
phosphoric acid product, greenish and runny like water. Anyone else know this?
It was fine as a prep between sanding, and/or media blasting but certainly not a
paint itself. You'll notice that after sanding, even high humidity will start
the rust process unless you use something like this. I think I even used it to
wet sand in the final stages.

Another body work question along the same lines (I also have holes under the
driver's feet in my '71) , has anyone used fiberglass and poly resin to cover
holes. What's the proper prep to make sure the polyurethane sticks to the metal?

How about epoxy resin with fiberglass, any better?
Thanks,
Joel Lusby
