Subject: [T2] Re:Convert Gasoline to Natural Gas?

 &gt;...I have a landrover already running on LPG.
As I understand it there are two systems &quot;OPEN&quot; and &quot;Closed&quot;.   In the UK
(And I'm pretty sure Australia) and the Netherlands and Germany .. Only
closed systems are allowed ..

Don't tell these guys about open loop systems being banned! (Could be an 
out of date site, though)
