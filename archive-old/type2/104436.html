Subject: Re: [T2] Steve Dolan Sighting

&gt; I think protocol requires that you specify
&gt; whether you saw the anterior or posterior (or
&gt; both) of Steve.  Anterior sightings are far more
&gt; common.  Many of us have only seen his posterior
&gt; protruding from some happy moonie's bus.

Or the very rare &quot;Crackless Posterior&quot; view.
