&gt;I've been told that the hubcaps for a 70 are a 1 year only
&gt;does anyone know if this is true, or will any 68-70 cap work


Hubcaps are all the same, up to '70 if you have stock wheels.  You can
distinguish them, they are deep like an inverted bowl.  Also pre 65 B**tle
hub caps fit.  Whoever told you that it's a one year item was misinformed or
pulling your leg.
