&gt; What do you volks think of this?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm certainly intrigued...
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone think of negative aspects of this modification, other
&gt; than the &quot;your stock VW engine should run cool enough if properly
&gt; tuned&quot;?

&gt; &gt; II was browsing through the parts catalogs at work while
&gt; &gt; thinking about the engine temps in the single cab ...
&gt; &gt; and then thought of the fact that Porsche 356s have
&gt; &gt; smaller pulleys than a VW. &quot;Hmmmmmmm....&quot; so I ordered the
&gt; &gt; parts that make up the generator pulley from Porsche hoping
&gt; &gt; they would fit. The idea was to let the alternator and
&gt; &gt; cooling fan spin a little faster.

It might be that spinning the fan faster won't flow more air.  If the flow
is already &quot;choked&quot; with the stock fan pulley spinning it faster won't
make any difference.  If you have a way to measure air flow it would be
easy to determine by plotting air flow versus engine RPM.  If the curve
still has positive slope at 5000 engine RPM then spinning the fan faster
would be effective, but if the curve flattens out it would just cause
problems.
