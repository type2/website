Subject: RE: [T2] distributor exchange headaches

With our older aircoolers, it can sometimes be hard to get the right stuff
from many local parts places. Usually you have to be the expert in order to
ensure you get the right stuff. I had my bus for about 8 months before I
found the T2 list...what a nightmare! Many of the folks here have come to
rely on a few vendors with web-based service who really specialize in air
cooled and/or buses in paerticular.

These guys do rebuilt distributors, and they seemed to be able to identify
the one I needed without any trouble:

These are some of my favorite general purpose bus vendors:

http://www.busboys.cc/
http://www.bustedvw_dot_com/

You can always try the dealer, sometimes you'll be pleasently amazed, but
it's always expensive, and sometimes they just don't want to do the research
for air cooled stuff.

Enjoy,

Hi list, the names Valentin Decker and I'm more or less new here. My
dad and I have been working on his bus ('75) recently and after
replacing a lot of wear items we happened upon what was wrong with the
car. The centrifugal advance had rusted itself in the 10 degree advance
position, which had obviously made the car run a lot worse when we
tried to set the timing correctly.

Anyway, we ordered a rebuilt distributor from a somewhat local VW parts
store. The part numbers were very different from the one we had
originally (according to oldvolkshome it's a 72-73 Bug dizzy). The
advance is very off. The bus won't pull until 3000 rpm (measured with
our cheapo inductive tach/dwell meter). Also, the total advance is
about an inch off the scale so I'd estimate something like 45-50 deg at
4500 rpm.

We got the old core back from the Donsco and it seems like the springs
in the centrifugal advance are not right. In the old distributor, the
springs were different, one stronger than the other (they were
