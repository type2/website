Subject: RE: Sound dampening in a 71 Westy

There's a marine sound deadening material I haven't seen mentioned on the 
List.  It's available in bulk, or &quot;kits&quot; at most any marine supply (West 
Marine, Boater's World, etc.)  This stuff is a sandwich of foam, foil, and 
sheet lead.

I haven't used it on our bus, but I did use it to insulate the engine room on 
an old Chris Craft we used to have.  The 327 Corvette engine would drive you 
right out of the cockpit when the revs got cranked up.  Adding this material 
to the motor cover and the inside of the engine space made an incredible 
difference in the noise level.  It also was very effective in reducing the 
amount of heat transferred to the surrounding area.

The stuff we used was 1&quot; thick and had a single layer of lead.  It was 
available in several thicknesses and combinations of foam, foil, and lead 
sheeting with the most expensive being around 2&quot; thick and having 2 layers of 
lead.
