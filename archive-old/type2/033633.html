Subject: BA6's &amp; stuff

Hi all, bet you thought I'd died. Truth be know, I was in lurk mode, bus
still in dock, new business taking time, new baby, trying to move house yada
yada yada. anyway, does anyone know the size of the solid fuel pipe between
the fuel pump &amp; the injector on a BA6? I want to change mine, but if I take
it off &amp; can't get a bit soon this bit won't go back.

Hope your all well &amp; busses remain rust free (yerrrr right)
