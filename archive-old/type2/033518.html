It might be that the starter has locked on the fly wheel also. I had this
happen on the 64 SC. The only way I could get it loose was to loosen the
bolts to the starter, jiggle a bit and tighten the bolts back. Don't know if
this is it but I would try this before any thing else.

&gt;Whoa...  If the engine doesn't budge with that sort of punishment, it must
&gt;be well and truly seized.  The best thing to do would be to drop the engine
&gt;and tear it down to find out what's happened to it.

&gt;&gt; I hear no starter sounds.  I had a friend tow me while I tried to pop
&gt;&gt; the clutch.  I was unsuccessful.  In fact the tires just locked and
&gt;&gt; dragged.  I got no engine turn over... Any ideas.....
