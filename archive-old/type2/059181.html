Hi
Can anyone help me? I've got a 1970 bus with: 1776 engine, 040 twin
webers, 044 heads, 1.25 rockers,  external oil filter, external oil
cooler, 2 qt sump - the fist cam installed was a standard cam after
18,000 miles the rivets holding the gear onto the cam started twisting,
allowing for over an 3/16 rotation of the gear while holding the cam in
the other hand. The performance shop installed another similar cam and
guess what I had it replaced again after about 18,000 miles. Now after
another 18,000 miles this latest one the third one is going out the same
way. The shop has only required me to pay for parts and no labor so far.
Now they want me to pay about a $1000 dollars to tear it apart and
&quot;refresh&quot; - new bearings, cam, hone out the cylinders and new rings.

So two questions:
1. Is this out of the ordinary for a stock cam to go out with my engine
configuration at every 18,000 miles?

2. The performance shop has kept my engine going for 60,000 miles with
the only cost to me 2 new camshafts. But it seems they are not fixing
the problem. Is it fair for them to ask me to pay for a complete
overhaul?

I live in California which now allows me to be smog exempt - any
suggestions on a new performance cam?
Thanks for any suggestions!

Glenn
