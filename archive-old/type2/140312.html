Subject: VW Camper &amp; Bus Magazine (UK) In Stock for U.S readers

I just received a container of parts from Just Kampers in the U.K., and at
Richard Atwell's suggestion, I had them send along some copies of the new
British VW Bus magazine for the enjoyment of us U.S. enthusiasts.

It really is a fascinating magazine, and not skimpy either (100 pages and
lots of color photos). Not only are there great articles and tech info, but
also lots of pictures of European campers and Type 2 variants that make me
drool. :-)  This is issue # 2, which includes a History &amp; Buyers Guide for
68-79 Campers, How to do a Camper Conversion, an article on a Devon camper,
and more. Also articles on splitties, Vanagons, and Eurovans, although 68-79
busses seem to get the most coverage.. (Issue # 3 is just hitting U.K.
newsstands now, but it wasn't out yet when my shipment left.  Alas my next
shipment from England is probably about 8 weeks out, but I'll grab some
copies then if these go over well.)

The price of $7.95 is roughly equal to the U.K. cover price.  This is great
reading, and well worth adding to a Bus Depot order. Added to an existing
order, the additional shipping cost for the magazine is next to nothing.
(If you order it by itself, the shipping will show up at about $3.50 in the
shopping cart, but it will actually be a bit cheaper - maybe $2-ish - when
it actually ships.)
