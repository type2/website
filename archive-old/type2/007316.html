&gt;Bonehead question #2. The last tags on the bus go back to 1990. How do you
fellow &quot;rescueers&quot; establish a paper trail after this many years of
neglect?&lt;

Mr. Moose,
        These details are going to vary from state to state.  I will tell
you what I do in Oklahoma.  I submit the tag number to the Dept of Motor
Vehicles (or ask a police officer buddy) to find out who the vehicle was
last registered to.  I type up a certified bill of sale on my computer with
fields for a seller, buyer, VIN, date, and notary public signature.  I
contact the last owner and request they sign my document.  If they cant be
contacted....well....it depends on how well you know a notary......  I then
take this notarized document to my local tag agency and they send me a
title in about a week.  I dont think this is that big of a hassle and have
gotten some really good deals on vehicles over the years as most folks are
scared of title problems.
