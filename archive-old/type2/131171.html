Subject: hella relay 4 aux batt

I have spent quite some time tonight in the archive - and can't seem to 
answer these three questions............  (apologies for those sick of this 
thread)

I have figured out from archives that the mysterious &quot;12/7S Socket&quot; is ment 
to be used for a towing harness.......which I will not be using.

1st question is......... do I take the wire intended for the 12.7S 
socket..._dot_comming from contact #87 on the relay ........and connect it 
&quot;directly&quot; to the positive terminal on battery??

While in the archives I came across refernces that I needed to incorperate 
this into the coil.
Where does this come in??   (on the diagram, contact #30 goes to positive 
terminal on the main battery.......  and contact #86 seems to go no-where?

does anyone know if contact #30 or #86 is where I go to the coil?


thanks in advance volks,  I think the archives have confused me even 
more.........if that is even possible.

thanks,
buddah
