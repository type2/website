&gt; Another approach I've seen for running a tube through sheet metal is
&gt; to use an electrical clamp of the style used when running Romex into
&gt; an outlet box.  This clamp screws into the hole, then clamps down on
&gt; the fuel line.  No vibration this way, though I think that you'd have
&gt; to be careful not to crush the line.

Gosh... Why didn't I think of this before...  Rather than using a Romex clamp,
git yerself down to yer local electrical contractor's supply and get a
.187-.250 or .250-.375 inch cord grip.  This is the correct fitting to put SO
cord (Black extension cord wire) into electrical boxes.  Consists of a fitting
that goes through a 7/8&quot; hole, a neoprene grommet, a bearing washer and a
&quot;nut&quot; to compress the grommet.  I use 'em all the time at work.  Probably
costs all of a buck. It would be PERFECT!   The ones that I use are made by Appleton.
