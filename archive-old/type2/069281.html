Interesting thing happened to me, this evening. Went to go look at a
cheap '72 bug, the guy flooded it, cranked, and cranked, and suddenly...

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;BAAAAANG!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &lt;Only LOUDER and sharper&gt;

The oil cap flew off with enough force to shatter itself against the
underside of the hood. Shrapnel missed both my self and my other by mere
hairs. (Like normal hairs, but smaller)

Needless to say, we're going to think on it a bit.

Anyone know why? Too much compression built up? Cheap oil cap? Bad aim?

Thanks,
