&gt; Well, easiest way to tell if hydraulic would be to ask rebuilder what went
&gt; in there- yes 79 should have hydraulics-

I read in the Haynes manual that hydraulic valve engines have solid steel 
pushrods, and non-hyraulics have hollow aluminum ones.

While fixing leaky pushrod tubes, I noticed my pushrods are hollow, but 
I'm positive I have hydraulic valves ('79 van, GD engine-model series).

Any ideas?
