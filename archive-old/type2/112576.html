Subject: Rear hinge covers

Someone put out there that C1P1 had the rear hinge covers for sale in white for 
$49. Somebody else put out that these were the same as the type3 hinge covers 
and if this is true then another source for these is 
www.vwinnovations/type3.html#hinge and they also come in black for the same 
price.
