Shelby:
i would start by hosing the bottom of the engine.
to properly diagnose the oil leak, it will be easier.
pop the valve cover and have a look.
leave a large piece of  cardboard under the engine
overnite. the oil in the heat exchanger will burn off,
but can take a while, and can be quite disturbing.
you could also pull the topside heater hose and
flood it to clear a lot of the oil out.
you haven't mentioned any expensive mechanical
noises, so i would start w/ the leaks and a general
inspection, including carbs and ignition, valves and plugs,
and defective head exhaust gaskets. you also might check
cylinder head torque on bottom row , then do total torque
procedure if it indicates.
