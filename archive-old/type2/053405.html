Subject: Re: Engine Dolly

Listees: I have built John Hartranft's dolly using the drawing he so 
graciously offers. The dolly is good gear and is everything he claims it to 
be. It should be a part of every serious engine cyclers shop ground support 
equipment. Thanks John. Ray from Spokane, 68 Campmobile, 69 Transporter
