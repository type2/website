Subject: exhaust studs...

Well I need to replace a stud from the head to my heater boxes (73 bus)
Does anyone know what thread pitch this would be??? It has a 13 mm nut on
it.  I think it is 8mm  but I know there are more numbers and I need to call
a place and have them cut me one so I can install it tonight.  Any hints on
the best way to get the broken stud out?  It barely broke.  Like less than
an 1/16 inch but it is just enough that the nut will go on but not tighten
so I will have to replace.

Well when I was working on my exhaust/heaterboxes I found my leak.. It seems
the part of the heater box that actually connects to the head fell off.
Looks like it will be JB weld tonite.  As I have been told  That part is
cast iron, and the pipe is steel so it is beyond my friends welding
capabilities.
