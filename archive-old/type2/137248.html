Subject: questions to rebuild my 1983 aircool engine

Hi everyone,

That's it , some people goes to the moon , some goes to the top of the 
everest, well ...I will rebuild my 1983 aircool engine myself !!! :-) I 
am very exiting by this decision right now, I am surely about to change 
my mind and regret in a few days ! ;-)
Anyway , I got 2 questions:
1) Is my engine a type II or type 4 ?, I am confuse about that (it is 
not clear to me when looking to the book &quot;how to rebuild your VW 
air-cooled engine), even my friend which is a mechanic is.
2) Is anyone among you guys has a list of what parts to change, which 
brand is better and give the best result, where to get the best deal for 
them. Any tips which is going to save time an money would be appreciate.

I'll try to write a nice howto rebuild an engine with a lots of pics  in 
my website  (if successful of course)

Thanks

Chris
