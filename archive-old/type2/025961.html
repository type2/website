You can put in a spark plug insert, you have to tap out the hole.  Use some
grease on the tap so most of your shavings stay with the tap.  If some of
the shavings get into the cylinder, don't sweat it too much, they are
aluminum and will be passed out.  The only danger is some might be trapped
under the exhaust valve which may hold it open for a short time, but then
should clean itself out.  If you don't feel comfortable doing it yourself,
take it to a shop.  You don't need to pull the engine and the whole process
takes less than half an hour.

&gt; Hello All,
&gt; Help, and please tell me all will be ok and relatively inexpensive, even
&gt; if you have to lie to me.
&gt; Spark plug on number 2 cylinder blew out around Memorial day.  No
&gt; problem, I put it back in.  Today she blew again.  This time a thread
&gt; was stripped and would not tighten.  Had Happy towed home, now what?
&gt; Hopefully a new plug will do the trick, however I don't feel that
&gt; lucky.  Why would this happen in the first place?  How much damage may I
&gt; have created by continuing to drive?  Would the exhaust leak have
&gt; anything to do here?
&gt; TIA
&gt; FEBIII
&gt; 71 Happy Bus
