Subject: Re: [T2] trip odometer

&gt; Was a late model black faced speedo with trip odometer ever produced?
 
Not sure but a 81 Vanagon speedo will work, with slight mods to the mounting screw holes.....
80 will not work. It is 45?mm thick and the lights will not illuminate it.
81 is 37?mm. I think 82 and up used push-on speedo cable. 80/81 was screw-on like bays.
