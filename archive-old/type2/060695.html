Subject: Tranny probs when cold - what oil to fix?
Content-Disposition: inline

Hi All,

My '78 is hard to shift when it is cold - especially into 2nd gear.  After it
has warmed up a bit it shifts into each gear easily.

I'd love to get the same performance when cold as I do when warm.

I think I am using 80W90 gear oil.  Would using straight 80 or straight 90
or ? give me that to me?

Thanks!
