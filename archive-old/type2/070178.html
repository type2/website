Subject: Re: Tool storage locations

.._dot_deleted Ron's description of his tool storage in back of bus.

I thought about that too, Ron, but opted for further up front due to fire
hazard. I tend to carry lots of tools, and though I probably couldn't save
the floorjack in the event of an uncontrollable fire, I'd have a good
chance at the main box, behind the passenger seat.

I do check and maintain good fuel lines and connections, but the hazard
still exists. With the box, I can lug it around to wherever I need it (as
long as I've had my wheaties). 8) Joe
