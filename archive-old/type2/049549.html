Subject: [T2] &lt;F&gt; Broken URL's on the Bus Names List

Greets -

During my bi-annual URL check, I noticed that:

Sally der Feuergeist and Snuffalupagus's URL's are broken. Can you folks let
me know if there is another URL you would like the Bus Names list to point
to?

BTW - We are up to 335 names (!) and 51 URL's. I wonder how many countries
are represented... I know of Germany, UK, Australia, US, and Canada. Any
more?

Thanks -
