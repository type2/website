Subject: Re: [T2] New old style bugs??worng list i know...

Stephen's V-Dub was in Arizona years ago then moved to Tacoma for a year or 
two then moved to Anacortes, WA, some 5+ years ago and some 30 miles East 
of me, mostly water. That's all he advertised for many years, complete 
restorations of Bugs. The last ads I saw a several years ago it was $7999 
for a very near original showroom US Bug. I don't know if they were all 
German parts or mostly of lesser parentage, but the client usually supplied 
their own used Bug for starters. The Stephen added $7999 worth of new parts 
and labor to make it like new. He may be retired, or semi-retired, as I 
have not seen him seeking new clients with ads in the Californicated VW 
Mags for some time. But maybe he is more than busy enough with word of 
mouth referrals. From the Anacortes directory, a single line of small print 
in the yellow pages under auto restoration heading,  360-293-3641. Tell him 
Doktor Tim says hi from San Juan Island.

As to a web site I've never researched it. Hit a websearch site and see if 
his name comes up with hits.
