Subject: high temp coatings etc..

All,
I stumbled across an ad for a company that makes high temp coatings and
adhesives for industry.  The name of the company is Aremco Products Inc,
and the web address is http://www.aremco_dot_com.  I wondered about the
CORR-PAINT CP40XX for heater boxes etc...
Has anybody used any of their products?
