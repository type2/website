Jeremy,

Alas, as far as I can tell &quot;dark knotty pine&quot; is on the &quot;out&quot; list world
wide :-(  I searched all the manufacturers I could find a couple years ago
and had no luck even coming close.  The very closest I could come was a
medium teak, which had no knots and was way too green in tint.  At the
same time, even tho it is &quot;out&quot; in the U.S, I have always wondered if dark
knotty pine may not be the &quot;in&quot; style in some other country... Germny,
Britain, Australia, etc. etc.  If anyone finds this elusive stuff in any
sort of plastic laminate (formica), please, please post!!!
