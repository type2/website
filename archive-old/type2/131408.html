Subject: Painting in MD/DC area

Hey, Glenn M...

I hope you enjoy your retirement!!  You may finally find the time to work on 
your VWs!!

I am in Northern VA, and I will be looking at a 'painting' project in a year 
or so, depending on if I can get the VW on the road.  It looks like you are 
pretty close to Dicks Autohaus in MD.

Some of the military base auto hobby shops have paint booths that are fully 
setup, and they even have 'experts' that can assist [for a price, of 
course].  depending if you are military retired or not.

Give me a pmail.  I would love to do some crabbing off the Wye, but I don't 
know exactly where to go.
