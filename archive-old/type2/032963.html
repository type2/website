Subject: Carver Heaters Sold out, but can order more.

I just sold the last 2 Carver P4 heaters I had.  There are a couple of 
listmembers that still want them, so If I can get a couple of more orders 
together, I think I can ship them before Christmas.

With the list discount the price is $650.  The regular price is $705.  
Shipping runs $22.50 to most US states, and $40 to Canada.

Check my web site for installation instructions and specifications.  You can 
also search the type2 and Vanagon archives for Carver, P4, or Propex.
