&gt;Ken,
&gt;
&gt;Are you referring to the server being very stupid because it bounced my
&gt;post or was my message very stupid and therefore picked up by a stupid
&gt;filter and bounced accordingly? Feeling ever so slightly self conscious.

Oh no! I am truly sorry. My syntax suffers when I become enraged at the
wicked ways of disobedient software. Yours was a perfectly fine message.
Welcome to the list.
