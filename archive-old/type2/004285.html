Subject: Asbestos in heater system?

I haven't had this stuff tested yet but I'd bet that this white fibrous
stuff that is used for the heater duct gaskets is asbestos. And what might
be inside those ducts that bridge between the heat exchangers and the hard
ducting under the bus?  Anybody found asbestos free replacements for these?
Seems like a terrible place to use the stuff.
