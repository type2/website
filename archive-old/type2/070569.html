Subject: help with sliding door spring

Hey everyone.
I need some help with that small spring that pushes the latches out 
which keeps the door open. The spring fell out and I cant seem to 
figure out how it goes back in, anyone know or have a pict of that 
area that I can look at as an example.

thanks.
todd.
