&gt; My problem right now is the tuning.  The first problem I'm getting is a
&gt; serious bit of run on after I turn the ignition off.  I'm guessing this
&gt; is due to a poor mixture (too rich?) but I'm not sure.  Any advice?
&gt; 
&gt; The second problem I've got is with the timing.  I have to use the new
&gt; 050 (mechanical) distributor that I've got for now, since my old vaccuum
&gt; advance dizzy is tired.  I've searched the archives and library.  Now I
&gt; need your help.

Actually, both of your problems are timing related. Too retarded. Advance it
a couple degrees at a time until it quits running on.
