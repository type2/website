&gt;I have thought that a great way for us to display our collective knowledge
&gt;is to use the Faq-O-Matic code.
&gt;
&gt;http://www.dartmouth_dot_edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/jonh/faq.pl
&gt;
&gt;This site documents the Faq-O-Matic. The Faq-O-Matic is a CGI-based system
&gt;that automates the process of maintaining a FAQ (or Frequently Asked
&gt;Questions list). It allows visitors to your FAQ to take part in keeping it
&gt;up-to-date. A permission system also makes it useful as a help-desk
&gt;application, bug-tracking database, or documentation system.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;We would need some one to start it and I am sure that it will snow ball.

Agreed, this is a great idea. However, the T2 server would need to have a 
perl engine running on it, and it might use up some bandwidth needed by 
the server. Assuming our hardware and server OS is up to it, I'd be happy 
to set it up and andminister it, once the server has reached it's real 
home... Comments from Mr. Hooper or Mr. Dolan? If the server isn't up to 
it, and we can't find a host, I intend to bring my personal domain 
in-house sometime this year, so I'd certainly be willing to do it once I 
had my own machine. Still, I think it would be best if it went on the T2 
server, assuming the bandwidth is there to support it...


Peace,
