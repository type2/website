Subject: Re: [T2] no spark :(

&gt;I bought a new coil, condensor, rotor and points.  Put it all in 
&gt;and still no spark???

You didn't mention your distributor cap.  Pop it off and look underneath to
make sure the little round black carbon thing (technical term??) is still in
the middle of it where the coil wire attaches.  It has been known for this
to either fall out or rub to oblivion.  

Happened to Dave Russel on his Westy a few years ago and happened to me on
my Discovery this past winter.  (And yes, that means my Land Rover has left
me stranded whereas my bus never has)
