Subject: Point Resistance

Dear list gurus - and guru-ettes

I have a small engine analyzer that measures 'point resistance'.

http://www.actron_dot_com/cgi-bin/web_store.cgi?page=cp7675.htm&amp;cart_id=9981384_22999

For my stock '78 2.0 liter, is this a good thing to know, and if so, why?

Thanks

Barry
