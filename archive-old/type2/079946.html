US324 Get them to send you a sample. Its not quite as brown as mine and
lacks the subtle grain look but I think its about as close as youll get
and I think I remember them only charging like 13.00/yd for it. I have
also found them the chapest source for good foam and they cut mine all up
for me at no charge a few years ago when I redid a bus.
