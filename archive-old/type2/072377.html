&gt;OK Mountain Folks,
&gt;
&gt;Who has successfully put an altimeter in their bus, and become 
&gt;pleased with what they bought?
&gt;If happy, what did you install?
&gt;Analog - Digital - Model ?
&gt;
&gt;I'm looking to install one in Casper so I can see how high we go as 
&gt;we go higher. :-)
&gt;
&gt;Does not need to have a low level scale for Houston peaks known as overpasses.

I was thinking of getting GPS. You can altitude from them as well 
locations, distance travelled and so on. Prices are getting real good 
for the basic models.

I spent 21 years as a ship's navigator, I would have loved to have 
one a GPS. Back then GPS's were bigger than my bus and were not 
installed on destroyers and frigates. When off soundings I mostly 
used a sextant, chronometer and compass, LORAN was only good in 
certain areas and Omega, in my opinion, was the biggest waste of 
money in navigational history.

I am getting old and spoiled.
