Subject: Sorta, maybe lookin' for a Bus...

A friend of mine with a history of Beetle ownership
and an engine or three in his garage is thinkin' about
getting a Bus...A 71 is what we figured out to be his
&quot;best bet&quot;...What he'd like is a cheap (as he is.. ;-(
starter Bus...Anything out there &quot;around&quot; northern 
NJ...Cosmetics are not a consideration as he re-
finishes furniture and is &quot;sorta, maybe&quot; lookin' for
something oldish/eyecatchin' to use for work...
