Yo Mike,
As I understand it, the flame begins to appear yellow as opposed to blue, 
but...........
I've never had on in &quot;failing&quot; mode,
just have had them in &quot;failed&quot; mode.

The symptom for &quot;failed&quot; mode is the engine stops running. :-)

One failure resulted in one heck of a &quot;BOOM&quot; and black smoke came out the 
tailpipe as I coasted over to the side of the road.

Of course, Zorm might act differently, as he would, most likely, fly over 
to the side of the road.
