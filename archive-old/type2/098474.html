&gt; So, who is gonna decide what a usefull life is???
&gt;
&gt; &quot;the EU will pass stringent recycling legislation requiring auto makers to
&gt; take back their cars after they've outlived their useful lives...&quot;
&gt;
&gt; On one hand, if one manufacturer say 8 years and another says 15 years,
&gt; whose car will you buy?

The manufacturers will have the Euro government set a flat standard.  And
no, owners won't be forced to scrap their cars, they will just have to pay
for outrageously expensive &quot;preventative maintainance&quot; (like replacing the
entire brake system at a set age) to keep the car on the road.  The
Japanese are masters at this.  Keeps the auto industry humming!
