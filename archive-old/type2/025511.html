&gt; You can also have a place like Kinko's drill the holes for you in the book.
&gt; They have a special kind or drill press that does not rip pages (don't try
&gt; the Makita : ) )

I work for a commercial printer. We have a Challenge three-hole drill, which
is a great tool...for most things, and it's better than the ones Kinko's
buys. But I used the smallest bits we own, and set the fence as close as I
could to the drill heads, and still hit the type.
