&gt;I've noticed that my '76 bus pulls to the right a little bit as I drive.

The Haynes manual gives some help on this, and there's some things you can
do yourself like taking up slack on the steering box and replacing ball
joints, but the actual adjustments need proper instruments.

Don't know about where you are but I got a tyre shop to balance the wheels
and check the steering geometry and it was only about 12 pounds UK ($20) and
well worth it.
