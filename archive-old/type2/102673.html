Subject: Aircooled Vanagon: RPM's vs. Speed

OK, one of you out there who has bothered to install a tachometer help me
out. In 4th Gear on a stock tranny, what are the RPMs for 55, 60, 65, 70 and
75 MPH? I want to know how high I am revving the engine at highway speeds
and figure out the best speed to cruise at without frying the valves or
overstressing the engine. I think the vanagon stock engine works best at
around 3000 to 3500 RPM, but I may be wrong.

TIA

                                Robert W.
