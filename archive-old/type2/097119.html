Subject: Re: [T2] ADMIN: Re: [T2] Interesting bus for parts or
  restoration on  eBay

George,

I do not mean to offend. I read the guidelines &quot;Do not try to advertise your
eBay auctions or other auctions on the list&quot; to mean do not advertise.

Quite rightly we don't yahoos posting their auctions for mercenary reasons
anymore than we want vendors posting their specials for the same.

My interest, however, was not mercenary but altruistic. I agree with Sage
Green (Barry) who wrote: &quot;I think the charter should be changed to allow
this kind of info sharing.&quot; Letting folks know something is out there,
whether a busyard in Duluth or body shop in Denver, serves everyone's
interest. In this instance a fellow List Member bought the Lovettsville bus.

It believe the guidelines should read &quot;Do not try to advertise on the list.&quot;
That is straightforward and easy to understand. Free sharing information,
however, should be allowed.

List Members are wise enough to know the difference.

Respectfully,

John Rogers

&gt; eBay we will go there and look.
