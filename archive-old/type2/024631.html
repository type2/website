Subject: Carb Rebuild '73 Euro Panel
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I bought this thing over the internet a few months ago, and it's been sitting 
in my driveway, so today I pulled the carb to rebuild it.  I drove the panel 
from Long Island to St. Louis, and it ran great on the highway.  But on city 
streets, I couldn't give it any gas, or it would stall.  I had to start out 
with as little gas as I could, and very slowly accelerate to get up to speed. 
 Once I had her on the highway, she did great.

Oh, one more thing.  The engine would sometimes backfire if I let off the gas 
suddenly when I was on the highway.

This panel has the original 1600 DP motor with solex 34 PICT3 carb.  It is 
now running some sort of electronic ignition with what may be the original 
vacuum advance dizzy.

I didn't notice anything unusual when I checked out the carb.  I haven't put 
the carb back on yet, but was looking for comments on the symptoms I have.  I 
plan to set the valves and check the timing.  I may also go ahead and replace 
the fuel pump and fuel lines.  The van has sat for the past 10 years with 
little use.
