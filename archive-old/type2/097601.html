&gt; &gt;but I think it would be amusing to get a speeding ticket on
&gt; &gt;the highway in an old VW bus.  Anyone ever gotten one?  Mike
&gt; &gt;&quot;Porsche-boy&quot; Gensler need not reply.  :)

&gt; On the maiden voyage in my 73 Westy with a nice, fresh, stock 914 2.0 FI
&gt; motor and 901 5-sp tranny I got stopped out in Eastern New Mexico.  Very
&gt; friendly cop came up to my window and told me he had clocked me at 87 MPH,
&gt; but that he wasn't going to write me a ticket since my old VW bus surely
&gt; wouldn't go that fast.  I didn't disagree.  Nor did I bother to tell him
&gt; that if that damned 20 MPH head-wind would die down that I would have been
&gt; doing a cool 100 :)

In Oz speed traps in the middle of nowhere are a major source of revenue for
the police, and the USUALLY set the radar trap etc thresholds for 15 KPH
over the limit, so I try to keep the camper ( only one registered at the
moment ) just below that on the highway ( yes, that's 70 MPH, but she's got
a really strong engine, recently built by one of the better VW specialists
in Sydney, and a set of his cooling scoops as well which work very well ).

Therefore, I haven't been booked on the highway with her, but it is amusing
to see the cops in the speed traps turn around and watch her go past with a
&quot; but they can't go that fast! &quot; look on their faces ;^)

Had a similar laugh one day that a large group of us were heading out for a
bike ride, and had to play follow the leader to the kick off point, problem
was that one car in the middle of the group was going REALLY slow, so we
were losing the leader. I decided to go around him and sit in the middle,
where I could see the first group &amp; the second group could see me ( hard to
miss a big orange box ;^), so I pulled out, accelerated to 80 to pass them,
pulled back in &amp; slowed down to a reasonable pace, there were a LOT of
shocked looks on our friends faces when the bus pulled out and accelerated
like that.
