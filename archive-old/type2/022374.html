It doesn't have to be that way - you can hide the stereo.  When I lived in California, my bus was stolen and stripped while parked outside my bedroom window.  I attribute it to the fact that I had a nice looking stereo mounted in plain sight and I left the lid off the seat containing all of my tools.  After that experience, I made sure the stereo and all components were 100% out of sight.  The head unit was in the glove box, and the speakers were hidden behind the door panels and behind the seats.  Now that I'm out of California, I don't worry as much about security, but I still hide the expensive stuff.

&gt;Other people mentioned that you
&gt;couldn't hear the radio over the engine or shouldn't
&gt;since you should pay attention to what your engine is
&gt;telling you.  

That's what gauges are for.

&gt;Ok, fine.  My opinion is that I love
&gt;driving my bus and I love music.  I'm gonna have great
&gt;tunes in my bus and I'm not going to waste time
&gt;worrying about somebody ripping me off.  And since
&gt;it's Friday, here's what I have.

Ditto.  Mine is set up as follows - custom cabinet that I built to fit between the front seats containing a 12&quot; woofer firing down at the floor.  The top holds maps, cupholder, etc. so it doesn't look much like a speaker.  I ordered an 80 watt amp to mount under the passenger seat from Damark, but they stopped carrying it and sent me a 300 watt one instead for the same price!  Holy cow this thing was huge.  Had to mount it behind the passenger seat instead of underneath, but no biggie, it's still concealed.  The head unit is mounted in a console above the windshield, along with a pair of 3.5&quot; speakers.  I keep thinking about putting in another pair of speakers behind the seat for more midrange, but I think it sounds okay as is.  Not audiophile quality, but when you have that much background noise, high-quality audio is kind of pointless anyway.  Kind of like copying one of your scratchy, 25 year old records onto a CD.  With this amp, the stereo can drown out the engine compl!
 etely,
 insulation or no insulation, but it's still not obtrusive from the outside like certain other vehicles.  I'm very happy with it and wouldn't want to go back to having an underpowered stereo.
