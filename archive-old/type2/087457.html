&lt;&lt; The CARB Email program will automatically send a list of vehicles' make,
model and year to interested parties, whenever a vehicle is scheduled to be
received at a dismantler's facility. The Email message will include the
dismantler's location, as well as the time when the vehicle is scheduled to
arrive at the dismantler.
