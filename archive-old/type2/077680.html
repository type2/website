Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Valves

I like the solenoid idea. Just cycle it with the ignition or a separate 
switch. Might require occasional use to keep it free.

How about a vacuum solenoid so there was no electricity involved? Vacuum 
holds it open, no vacuum, no open. Would require an electric something to 
open it at engine start for the fuel injected engines.

The other way would be to use the vacuum to close the valve in case of 
emergency. Hmmm. Bet this version would fail when it was needed the most.

&gt; &gt; I've been looking for said &quot;automatic&quot; valve that would open when the
&gt; &gt; ignition was turned on but have so far been unable to find it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm still looking.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Would be a great safety item in case of fire - would keep fuel from beeing
&gt; &gt; added to the fire and would require no effort to close - I'm certainly not
&gt; &gt; going to lean under my bus to turn a valve!!!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Maybe a brass valve with a choke cable added to the lever...
&gt;
&gt;Maybe a solenoid to actuate the handle on a ball valve?
