Subject: RE: [T2] And now with less power!

More detail.

Karl, one person's &quot;bone stock&quot; is another person's &quot;modified&quot;. :)

Good point though. What I mean by &quot;stock&quot; is there have been no
modifications in displacement, exhaust and intake.

My baseline is for a '71 model bus, since dual port heads, PICT 34 carb,
doghouse cooler and alternator are used. The other difference is a SVDA
dizzy with a Hot-Spark pickup.

28 to 30 degrees is a safe total advance for the motor as researched.

All bolts, boots and hoses holding associated with air, fuel and vacuum
intake are sealed, tight and torqued to spec (if necessary).

The &quot;less power&quot; is based off the &quot;seat of my pants feel&quot; from acceleration
from a stop and maintaining power up a local hill. Actual MPH figures are
not attainable since I screwed up my speedometer when I repaired it.

It may be entirely possible I have dreaded &quot;ass lag&quot; which Mark refers to,
although much more eloquently.

Mike, I don't drive it like a little lady, especially since I have to keep
up with Denver commuters. Horn doesn't work yet, so I have to be on the
offensive. I'm not getting blow-by which would indicate glazed pistons, but
I should check the compression.

Phil it is good to hear that the oil-bath filter won't reduce performance. I
have always been suspicious of those things...

At least it runs a whole heckavalot better. A little puzzling since I
haven't broken in a new solid lifter motor until this one. Thanks for the
input. If I'm still scratching my head after the trip home I'll let y'all
know.
