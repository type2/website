&gt; So you're telling me that if you stick your head into the engine
&gt; compartment and look in front (FIF) of the fan housing where it meets the
&gt; block, that seam matches exactly all the way across?  No gaping hole there
&gt; where the curves diverge?  I have a very clear recollection of a problem in
&gt; this area.  I guess it's possible that they changed the case, I think mine
&gt; was an '81.

David, mine fit like a glove.  No gaps anywhere.  I started with a bare
long block and added all the '78 accesories one at a time.  All fit no
problem.
