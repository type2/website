Subject: Front Window Seal Installation

Hi,

We brought home my '68 campmobile safe and sound this week and I love the
way it looks in the driveway. :-D I can't wait to get it on the road!

We gave it a thorough once over and we found that the windshield seal is not
properly installed. It's 'half on' along the top. After some poking and
prying, we decided that we should just replace it. So, I bought a new seal
and we're going to take the window out and replace it.

Any tips on this? We know the basics on it I think but I'm wondering what
kind of string to use? I'm thinking nylon string and my s.o. is saying
'thick fishing wire&quot; perhaps.

We know to warm the seal prior to installation but what is the best way to
do this during the winter? Should I bring out a hair dryer to keep it warm
as we install it?

Also, how the heck do you use the talcum powder that I read is recommended?
While we were fiddling with the old seal today I got covered with powder. A
bit amusing I guess.

Thanks,
Jen
