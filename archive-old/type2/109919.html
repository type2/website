Subject: Exhaust Torque

I can't seem to find the specs to torque down my exhaust manifolds to 
cylinder heads (with copper gasket in between).  It is an 8mm stud i believe with a 
13 mm hex on it.  I was thinking 18 foot-pounds, but if anyone has the true 
specification of the torque, let me know.

thanks
Kev
