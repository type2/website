Subject: idle woes

This is a continuation of the &quot;normal vacuum?&quot; thread...

Well, with the wavering vacuum readings under 15&quot;, I decided to check the
ignition.  Pulled #3 plug while idling and nothing happened!  I thought
this was _the_ problem, so I swapped the spark cable and plug with some
extras I had... and still idle problems (#3 is firing now, though).

Vac seems steady at 15&quot;.  To get the bus to idle, though, I need to keep a
brick on the accelerator while I monkey around in the engine compartment.
The idle adjust screw is out several turns, the timing is way advanced
(otherwise the engine dies).  Last I checked, compression was in the 130's
all the way around (just replaced the heads).

Is this still a vacuum issue?  I'm goin' crazy here!  Today I'll get
another parking ticket for street sweeping (couldn't start the bus after a
morning of constant start/stops, no place to push the bus)...  Aargh!
Sorry, had to get that out.

This all started a few weeks ago... the bus was running fine, though I had
to time it at 7.5BTDC instead of the normal 5ATDC.  No vac retard was the
diagnosis, so I went crazy replacing and clamping all the vac hoses (I
did the fuel injector seals at rebuild time).  Now, the bus barely idles
and only with the accelerator depressed...  What am I missing?
