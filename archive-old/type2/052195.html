Subject: [T2] RE: bad AFM

If your mechanica ran out of adjustment with the idle air adjustment
screw, and
was still unable to get the mixture within specs, I would think (this is
conjecture
based on my tinkering) that they would be able to use the adjustment on
the AFM slide.
 
Pop the top open on the AFM. The spring tension is adjustable, as is the
initial position
of the wiper in relation to the air flapper. Setting this initial
position should be
almost the exact same thing as dialing in the idle air adjustment screw
since they
both offset the inital &quot;zero&quot; reading.
 
Now, this isn't to say that your engine might not have something wrong
with it, but when
my AFM temperature sensor went out, the engine wouldn't run at all.
Also, if your head temperature
sensor was bad, make sure your plugs aren't fouled.
 
I'd just try the coarse adjustment before running off to get an AFM.


someone else wondered what the AFM is:
Air flow meter. It measures the volume of air flow going into the
engine. The incoming air enters
the box, where it encounters a spring loaded flap.  The flow volume
opens the flap. The flap position is
sensed by a potentiometer attached to co-axially to the flap axis. This
provides a means of sensing
flow volume electrically.  On the VW AFM's, the spring tension is
adjustable to allow for changes in
air density. It also includes a &quot;idle air screw&quot; which is a screw acting
as a needle valve. The needle
vavle allows air to bypass the flapper valve- allowing adjustment of
&quot;idle&quot; mixture. There is another means
of adjusting the offset on the wiper itself, which would have the same
effect as the idle air screw.
