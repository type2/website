FYI,  that is a Ghia air filter, NOT a 71 bus air

Hello Lee  Yes Karl is right on this. You can still use the ghia one  ,it 
just isn't what came on the bus.  I do have a bus one if you really  need one let 
me know. You can tell a bus one by the lever that hooks to the flap  on the 
intake.  later  mark dearing
