Bus Rebellion in So-Cal

as reported by:
T.Rance Porter and Barney Doore-Bus detectives

Orange County, Ca- After years of complaining and whining among the local
Bus ranks about the apathy and lack of leadership in S.O.T.O., the Society
of Transporter Owners, it appears that a new group has taken over the reins
in Southern CaliforniaÌs Orange County. Recent S.O.T.O. events have drawn
less than 25 busses, and even the International Bus Treffen had a dismal
turnout. The only S.O.T.O. events worth attending in recent years have been
the anniversary meets÷÷.which most agree are only big because they have
been held on the VW Classic Weekend.

So to those in the know, it was no surprise when some of the major players
in the SoCal bus world banded together this past summer to form O.C.T.O.,
Orange County Transporter Organization, the newest NEATO chapter (the other
national bus outfit.) The first O.C.T.O. event was held in October at Moe
MooreÌs Transporter Garden in Huntington Beach and over 75 pre-1967 VW
Transporters attended. It was just like the old days. The guy in charge was
there on time, no lines, and no admission charge. There was coffee and
donuts in the morning, hot dogs and a giant raffle for lunch. Everybody
went away with a smile on their face.

After the success of the first event another was planned for February 7,
the day after the LA VW Toy show. This time 145 pre-1967 VW type IIÌs
showed up. It was a good thing Moe made arrangements to use the parking lot
next door because his complex was packed wall to wall with pick-ups,
panels, KombiÌs, and Deluxe Micro Busses. Both V.T.O. and Box on Wheels,
the other two local NEATO chapters, along with San DiegoÌs Strictly Type
IIÌs, brought large contingents. The raffle was the largest these reporters
have seen in some time, and &quot;Hot Dog&quot; Fred Waugaman offered a great braut.

The next event on the O.C.T.O. tour will be June 12, 1999. The First Annual
O.C.T.O. Show will be held in a parking lot across the Street from the
Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim, home of the Mighty Ducks. The O.C.T.O. Show will
now be the official Bus meet of the 1999 VW Classic Weekend. Gates will
open at 7am, with a raffle and awards at noon. It looks like with the
support of the other local clubs and the VW Classic, the First Annual
O.C.T.O. Show will be the buss meet not to miss!!

Stay tuned for more details÷÷÷.
