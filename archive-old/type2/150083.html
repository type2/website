Subject: Re: [T2] Van sitting for two years, what can I expect?

Hi Dan,

Congrats on the new ride.

Suggestions:

1. Tires and all other rubber components will age without being used.  
Look at them very carefully before setting out. Replace all the fuel  
lines ASAP for the same reason.

2. Pull the spark plugs and check under the cooling tin to ensure  
there are no wasp or rodent nests there to block the flow of air.


Happy trails,

Greg Potts
