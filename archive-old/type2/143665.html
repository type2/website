Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Overheating / to those who use Gene Berg

Arnaud,

I don't currently have gauges installed, so my observations are even less
scientific.  But my experience is very similar: I definitely agree that uphill
grades and outside air temperatures make a *big* difference in top speeds when
keeping the engine cool is a priority.  My Bus will run cool at 65 ad
infinitum if it's cold outside.  If it's not crisp outside, I'm not at all
comfortable cruising at 65.  More like 55-60, or 55 period if it's warm
outside.   So far, I've never driven my Bus in temperatures above 80.  I drove
to L.A. last winter, kept it at 55 through the San Joaquin valley, and the
engine stayed satisfyingly cool.

- Miles

p.s. Did you really find that 25 in 3rd worked well?  I often use 25 in *2nd*
to climb hills, but... oh.. maybe the 009 is the main reason that my Bus would
tend to overheat if I tried to drive uphill at 25 in 3rd (not enough advance
to cruise under load at low rpms).
