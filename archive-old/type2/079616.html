Subject: Re: [T2] hot starters

You are darn right the cables get hot when you are
continuously cranking your bus. I put my Vortex sealed
battery in my 74 bus and tried in vain to start it. I
didn't realize that the ground strap was touching the
side of the battery case and the strap melted a hole
right through the sealed case of my battery. That
battery is now dead as a door-nail. I am just glad it
was still under warranty. I might try and replace
these cables with somthing like you mentioned. Good
Idea! Well, I just thougth I would give my $0.015
worth.

&quot;there's something we need to remember 
&gt; about hot starters.  When you crank the engine for a
&gt; while not only is the 
&gt; starter getting hot but the cable from the battery
&gt; is too.&quot;  
&quot;Replaced the original cable with a
&gt; nice 4ga steel jacketed 
&gt; (the kind they use on ships).  Never heard a starter
&gt; turn over so fast in my 
&gt; life.&quot;
