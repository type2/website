Subject: Re: [T2] new exhaust manifold/tappping question

I'll assume you don't know this - there are specific sizes of drills that match tap sizes. 1st make sure that you have the right size drill for the tap you are using. 

2nd, never use a drill to drive a tap. Use a tap handle. Go to Sears. They have them.

3rd, get some tapping oil. Start the tap by hand straight. Screw the tap inward (pressure on the tap to go into the hole). Screw in a partial turn, screw out, in, out, in out. Each time go in a bit further and come back out a bit more than your last in starting point. This breaks the metal chips.
