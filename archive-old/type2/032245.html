I've used tin (actually steel) cans cut the long way with tin snips and
then hose clamped in place with a little bit of liquid exhaust patch
compound on motorcycles several times with good enough results.  can last
for months and even keeps a piece which has rusted in half together.  Also
gives the urban motorcycle that 'rat bike' look which is an effective
theft deturant.  On the crossover pipe it would not be visable.  BONUS!
you can do the job in situ!  Not the right way, but its about an 85%
solution and cheap and quick and you can find more cans and hose clamps
anywhere there are roads.
