Subject: Re: [T2] 75 FI bus won't start

&gt;  Put a test light on the
&gt; injector plugs and they are NOT getting power.  No smell of gas at
&gt; exhaust after much cranking.  Checked the center prong on the series
&gt; resistor plug and that has juice.  Tried another double relay, NaDa.
&gt; Checked terminal one on the MPC and it has power- means coil trigger
&gt; wire is continuous and OK?.

MPC?  What is that?
The coil trigger wire comes from the #1 terminal of the coil. It should pulse
voltage when the points open and close. The injecters do not run continously,
they open when the points open. Terminal 1 on the ECU. It is a long single
white wire exiting the EFI harness about 6&quot; from the ECU plug.
