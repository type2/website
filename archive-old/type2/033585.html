Subject: My 914 bus/longish

Today I visited A tiny german  man who is all about VW's. I had him look at
mine and he did in fact confirm it is a porche 914. He also said &quot;what a
mess!&quot; with some disgust as his head dangled into my top hatch. He does Vw
work on the side(the side of retirement) and I was referred to him after a
&quot;MECHANIC&quot; at &quot;Helmut and Vito's&quot;  Said upon looking into Blues nether
regions &quot;What do you mean your not sure what kind of engine this is? Its a
pancake!&quot; After I pointed out the centrally located Oil filler and dip he
scratched his head and said &quot;I Dunno...&quot; with a German accent. He then
pointed to a modest home across the street of my new german friend.
SO thats good.
My new friend then looked at me and said &quot;sure I can do the rebuild...&quot;
then, glancing at my fiberglass roof said &quot;....but not until after winter,
Ill never get it in my garage!&quot;
SO thats bad.
My regular Vw mechanic who is over priced and takes a long time to do the
work said he'd rather put a 1700 back in so everything would be easier to
work on in the future. This makes sense. Although Ive always loved the power
of my engine all the time thinking I had a fairly stock 17 or 1800. I dont
know if I would be happy with a downgrade.
prices;(AVP)
2000 914 outright= $1596
1700 t2     outright=$1089
To add, Im not sure if the 914 is 2.0 or not. My mech said they all were but
avp has 17-1800 914's?
Does any one have any suggestions as to wich route to take in their
experience?
The 914 rebuild(2.0)
or 1700 stock?
Im at a crossroads here and the knock in the 914 is not getting any
softer........
ALSO...(sorry)   he stated that a 914 is very much like a VW engine except
for the heads. THre really isnt much diff. so what would be the advantage to
having a 914 2.0 or a VW 2.0?
THNK YOU THNK YOU THNK YOU THNK YOU!!!!!!!
I appreciate all you taking the time to read this. All this back and forth
is very frustrating!!!
