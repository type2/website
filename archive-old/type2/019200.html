Try using a really strong penetrant.  Something like PB Blaster (no
affiliation ;-)  WD40 probably won't work.
spray some on and tap the nut w/ a hand sledge then spray some more -
wait a few minutes - repeat.
You didn't say what you were using to remove the nut.  If you are using
a socket, get the recentl;y discussed axle nut striking tool.  If you
can't get one, then put a pipe on the end of the breaker bar to get more
leverage, while putting force on the bar, pop the back of the socket w/
the hand sledge. apply &quot;bouncing&quot;force on the breaker bar (not constant)
and pop the socket when you apply the force.  If this doesn't work, get
the striking tool.
If you have the striking tool - do the penetrant thing, then pop the
striking tool.  You can put a braker bar on the striking tool as well.

Also, look at the threads on the axle stub.  If I remeber right, on one
side the threads are reversed.

good luck

I have been having difficulty removing one of the rear axle nuts. I have

tried heat, to no avail, and so far I have bent two separate 3/4 inch
breaker bars.
I have been thinking of chiseling the nut off. Before I do that I
thought I'd see whether someone knows a trick.
Thanks
