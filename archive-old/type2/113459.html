Yes, it is a relatively easy adaption. You will need a small bolt. I don't 
recall but not bigger than 4mm. I drill a hole through opposite flats, 
insert the cable and swag it into a loop through the head. This creates a 
straight pull on the cable. If you just loop the cable around the head it 
will put side strain on the pull and foul your t-stat with side loading. 
This bolt then threads into threads on the T-I t-stat. That't the only 
difference, the T-IV has male thread interface and the T-I is female. As to 
the tiny hole through the bolt head, I leave that to the machinist next 
door. Takes him 5 minutes with the right vice and the right press and the 
right drill.
