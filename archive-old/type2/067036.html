Subject: Re: --- where are you living??? ---

&gt;Where you live: State, city, and a nearest big city

Memphis, TN...about a mile from Ken Hooper.

&gt;What is you van: year, model

'67 Westy Camper (first cousin to Ken's singlecab, about 7 miles away from
his, down a long, lonely road). As a matter of fact, Ken's VW emblem is on
my bus...making it MY VW emblem &gt;) ...of course, I'm sure we'll correct that
when we go to pick them up. (I'm getting another emblem for mine.)

Sorry, I'm limited to one van. It's in the amended marriage contract...you
know, the one you have to sign to get to keep buying parts and toys...er,
TOOLS, yes, TOOLS will come in handy in a variety of ways, honey.

&gt;What is your name:

Joe Fournier

&gt;What is the name of your van:

yeah, right. people who name their vans can't afford therapy (I have
insurance that covers it ;)

&gt;What is the URL for your home page: (if you have some)

don't have it set up yet, but the URL will be 

http://mindspring_dot_com/~jfournier

....or something like that. Just keep trying til you see it.

&gt;
&gt;Do you think I can answer how old are you?? 
                    ^^^^^^
go ahead, take your best guess. (Sorry Jean-Baptiste, I've been in the house
too much lately, so I'm trying to be funny.)

36

Your map is a good idea as long as it doesn't fall into the hands of the
smog patrol. ;) Thanks! Joe
