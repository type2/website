Subject: Re: [T2] master cyl leaking?

&gt; &gt;&gt;  My brake booster looks like it's been taking a bath
&gt; lately and it seems to be coming from a tiny &quot;hole&quot;
&gt; at the very bottom of the flange on the m.c. that bolts
&gt; to the booster.
and
&gt; Billy, the MC on my '72 has a tiny hole, exactly as you describe, and the
&gt; brake fluid seemed to be draining out of it.
&gt; I could not imagine a how so tiny and so perfetly centerered on the bottom &gt; part of the MC flange, as the
MC flange connects to the booster.
&gt; Can anyone describe if this hole is suppose to be there, what function it
&gt; should play.

I have been searching the net for a description of why that hole is supposed to be there....but alas, I have
stuck out.

Yes, the hole is supposed to be there. It is the drain hole for when the rear plunger [secondary cup] seal
leaks. It appeared when power brakes came along. Because of the vacuum on the end of the master when it is
mounted on the booster, they had to add a rear seal. This keeps the vacuum from sucking the fluid out of the
master. When the secondary cup seal leaks, it is supposed to drain out the weep hole. The rear seal is
supposed to keep the fluid from draining into the booster.
I did find this website about a guy changing his Toyota master cylinder and he talks about the drain hole:

This site talks about the master cyl. leaking onto the booster, but not why...:
