Subject: Re: [T2] FI or carb

I have a single Weber and have been pleased with it. 
I haven't had those problems.  But I have always
preferred FI in other vehicles I've owned.  Tell me
more about the AFC system.  What does it cost, how
hard to install, can a dope like me figure out the
instructions, etc?  I'm not opposed to change if it
can save me trouble down the road.  And I could use a
little better gas mileage.  Thanks...KR

&gt; 
&gt; Also, if you really look at it, the AFC FI system is
&gt; pretty daggummed
&gt; simple. A few sensors, the injectors and related
&gt; plumbing and the
&gt; brainbox, and that's about it. The FI system on my
&gt; '79 has been stone
&gt; reliable; the bus starts instantaneously in hot or
&gt; cold weather, idles
&gt; like it should, runs very smoothly and is returning
&gt; 20-23 mpg on 87
&gt; octane. Don't just take my word for it, but I'd look
&gt; long and hard at
&gt; the pros and cons before I gave up on a gimpy FI
&gt; system. Make it work!
&gt; Good luck-
&gt;
