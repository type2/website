Subject: Part Help Needed

While driving home the other day, my gas pedal went to the floor. No
problem I think. I go the import shop and get a new cable. However, when
I go to install it today. I find what I think is a &quot;broken&quot; part. The
metal piece the cable feeds into is hanging &quot;loose&quot;. Three parts stores
and two hours later, I still don't have a replacement nor know exactly
what the name of this part is.

If anyone can help with both the name and a vendor, I would truly
appreciate it.

You can view the bad picture (phone camera) here:

Thanks to all.
