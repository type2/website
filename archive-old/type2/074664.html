Subject: BC Canada Wreckers?

hi all,
I am going to be traveling from Calgary, AB to Vancouver and Whistler in my
1977 Bus. If anyone knows any good wrecking yards along the way or near by
please let me know. The trip is completely unplanned except for seeing Burt
Neilson Band in Whistler on Monday and Oysterhead in Vancouver Tuesday so if
anyone in those areas is interested in a trip to the wreckers or having a
beer on Monday or Tuesday during the day let me know.
have a great weekend,
Glenn
