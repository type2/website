Bry's in West Seattle, WA has them on a few bent up Rivieras.  I just called
and he's asking $45.00 for them.  Not sure what's left.  I saw 3 of them
about a month a go.  The main fabric was in good to excellent shape - some
of the bug screens were showing their age.

Here's the location:

Bry's Auto Wrecking
206-938-3868
4017 West Marginal Way SW, Seattle 98017.
Hours are 9-7, Monday - Saturday

I'd offer to scope them out for you but I've got a Scout camp this week end
with my son - wish there was a scout merit badge for bus camping  :-)

You might also contact Dawn at http://www.plfvw_dot_com/ she'll make you a new
one.
