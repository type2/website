&gt; &gt; anyone have more info on how to adjust flapper.  nothing in Bentley...

&gt; Yeah, you'll either need a wb02 or a exhaust gas analyzer.  If you go to
&gt; a smog shop (I'm assuming you live in a state that does smog), they can
&gt; look at the values of where a bus is supposed to be (preferably at load)
&gt; and then adjust.  Then after that's dialed in, adjust the idle screw.


you seem to be describing the CO adjustment prochedure...  haven't gotten
that far....   engine won't idle at all.  I moved the flapper itself to
get idle not an adjustment.   how did it get out of adjustment. passed my
last smog test with good numbers. so why would I need now to adjust CO
level before I get the engine running?????


more confused???
