Subject: Re: [T2] A/C Condenser fans needed

I would check out this guy if you want to do it right.

He has been doing this forever and has a system that is far superior to any
original. More BTU's and less HP required.

&gt; &gt;Don't forget to tell all of us where you found them so it will be in the
&gt; &gt;archives.....I will probably be doing the same and looking for some for
my
&gt; &gt;78 soon.
&gt;
&gt; Okay, here's what I found:
&gt;
&gt; &quot;Ed&quot; at
&gt; Gilmore Enterprises
&gt; Clearwater, Florida
&gt; (727)573-2944
&gt;
&gt; It took me a while, but I finally got in touch with Ed by phone
&gt; today.  Great guy and very knowledgeable about A/C in busses.  He said
that
&gt; his solution was to get rid of the louvers on the bottom and the shroud on
&gt; the top and put a pair of 12&quot; flat fans on top blowing DOWN.  He says he
&gt; has done this many times and there is a vast improvement in cooling.  He
&gt; sells the fans along with mounting kits for $79 each.  Sounds like a
decent
&gt; solution, but not one that I will be going for right away, at least not
the
&gt; part about removing the louvers.  I think the louvers are necessary to
&gt; protect the condenser.  Removing the shroud sounds like a good idea though
&gt; - why didn't I think of that?  I guess it frees up enough room to go up to
&gt; a 12&quot; fan.  Hmmm... why not four 12&quot; fans wired in series/parallel to keep
&gt; the current draw down?  Would cover almost the whole surface that
&gt; way.  Only problem would be the expense of the fans.
&gt;
&gt; He also said he will soon be selling an under-dash A/C unit specifically
&gt; for 68-up busses that has dual evaporators (one on each side).  He said
&gt; this solves most of the problems that the typical under-dash units have
&gt; with bulkiness, etc..
&gt;
&gt; One more thing and this is GOOD INFO folks - he says you can get belts to
&gt; replace the thin, behind-the-fan-housing A/C belt on the original A/C
&gt; systems.  He described the correct belt as a 15-series 47&quot; belt made by
&gt; GoodYear (plain belt, not hi-miler or other knockoff).  Shouldn't be too
&gt; hard to get.
&gt;
&gt; He also says he is in final development stages of a kit to mount a rotary
&gt; Sanden 507 or 508 compressor under the tin (the original location).  I am
&gt; going to call him back periodically and try to get one when it is
available.
&gt;
&gt; Bottom line - Ed is a great source of bus A/C parts and info.  Call him if
&gt; you need anything.  Very nice guy.
&gt;
&gt; Also talked to the people at ICE in San Diego (http://iceac_dot_com/).  They
&gt; tried to help but couldn't give me the specific information I needed
&gt; (price, dimensions) and never followed through with a promised
&gt; callback.  They did claim to have some 8&quot; low-profile fans though so they
&gt; might be worth calling.  I would call Ed first.
&gt;
&gt; -David
