Subject: Any of you have this???

I need a set of front rotors for the Mothership.  She has stopped enough times on these.  Her feet need to be replaced.

If any of you have a spare set, and are in the Atlanta region, and would like to rid yourself of them for a bit of money, let me know.  I will buy them.

They are a bit more pricey new than my budget will allow.

I plan on basically rebuilding the entire front end including brakes, steering linkage, balljoints and all.

I accept any and all advice.  : )
