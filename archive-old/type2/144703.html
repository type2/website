Listen to them talk about the details - debates about the correct chassis
paint gloss - or lack there of, picky, picky picky -ness about
repalcement part details (not a question of function) and big prices on
alot of reproduction parts because the quality has to be just so...

You should hang with the Ford T guys.  They gain or lose points in
competitions for having the correct or incorrect plating on certain bolt
heads on the transmission.  The fun part is that the parts varied during
production, so the judge looks at the car, consults his big book, looks at
the car again...

I never want to see that at a VW show!
