Funny, I bought a bus from some surfer guy in Long Beach and found about
three &quot;mystery pipes&quot; under the back seat and &quot;mystery screens&quot;  LOL

&gt;what was it ???

Funny you should ask! I was just gonna post on this (on the off-chance
anyone remembered), because we figured it out this weekend! The mystery
pipe turned out to be part of the EGR system -- there's a T and it had
broken some time in the past. Somebody braised (brazed?) the hole in the
crosspipe closed, and put a bit of rubber hose around that so the mystery
pipe wouldn't rub on it. Ta daaaah! Mystery solved. We made gaskets to
close off the connections for the crosspipe and just left everything else
as is.

It's good once again to have some time and energy (and money!) to spend on
my bus, after a month of dealing with an elderly and ailing cat (I think
she had a stroke). She's doing much better now, but it was scary for a
while there.
