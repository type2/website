Subject: Tire request

I need one (1) Yokohama 370 LT195/75-R14 tire in good used condition.
Anybody have one laying around? I broke a radial on my last long road trip
and would hate to replace ALL the tires when only one is bad. Currently, I'm
using my  P195/75 passenger tire spare in the front.

So, here's the full story: about three weeks ago I clipped a curb going
around a turn at about 15 MPH..... after that, no problems. I took off on my
2000 Mile roadtrip and noticed a shimmy at highway speeds starting to
develop at about 400 miles into the trip..... checked the pressure and
visually inspected the tires and found nothing wrong. Still, the shimmy kept
getting worse and, by the time I'de located a WallyMart [tm] Tire&amp;Lube, it
felt like I was driving a jackhammer down the road.

The Wally Mart folks pulled the tires to do a Rotate and Balance (free
lifetime) and the balancer found the problem.... a huge buldge under the
inboard treads indicating radial ply rupture...they said if I had kept going
on this tire, I would have been at great risk for a blowout on the road.
This was the same tire that I clipped on the curb and there was really
minimal to no external visible damage ( a small scuff mark on the outboard
sidewall).

So, they balanced the spare and put on the front pasenger side (lowest
stress) and I completed my trip like that.

So, if anyone has a spare Yoko 370 ..please let me know.

                                    Robert W.
