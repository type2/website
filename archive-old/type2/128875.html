Subject: EveryBus T-Shirts, Dash Plaques, Final Update

Howdy all, just wanted to send out a last word on EveryBus merchandise
before I leave in a couple days. I got the shirts in last week, and they
are great. I will have a few extras for sale there, but find me early, as
they always sell out within a couple hours. I also got the dash plaques,
and everyone who has seen them so far agrees that they are really nice,
and will be a fine memento of the greatest EveryBus ever.
:)
I'm planning to get there early Friday afternoon, and will be in the
TeamSpatula_dot_com green crew cab, hopefully in my usual spot.
Look forward to seeing everyone there!
