Subject: Warm idle 

Just wondering how long it is suppose to take for the idle to drop after
driving. I had problems with the warm idle not dropping and tracked it down to
one of the vacuum hoses on the decel valve. Now the idle drops down to 900rpm
where I have it set and timed at 7.5 btdc, but sometimes it takes almost a
full minute or a little longer. Is this normal? Sometimes it takes longer
after a long highway run. I guess it could be a good thing to help the engine
cool after a long drive then going into stop and go driving. What do you
guys/gals think? Oh, its a 78 Westy.
