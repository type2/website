Subject: water puddle on dash
Cc: vwbrain_at_aol_dot_com

hi list, this is the last thing i expected to write about.  i have a leak,
causing water to pool up where the dash meets the frame under the
windshield. a new rubber gasket and window were installed 18 months ago,
but the bus had been under a carport since then. getting into the car on a
rainy yesterday i found the carpet, kick panels, and gear shifter were
soaked. that water came from a drip above the dash. i dried it up and sure
enough it dripped anew out of the windshield rubber- dead center bottom of
the windshield. its snug! and am trying to think back about a good thread
regarding a fix having to do with a 3m product and a syringe. could
somebody please specify? thanks,
steve
