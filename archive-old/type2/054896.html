&gt;Oh man! I was wrestling with a stubborn exhaust bolt just today.
&gt;Not that I need to advise you to do this ('cause you'll be doing it on
&gt;your own without prompting), but cussing a lot while working on it is a
&gt;good way of managing the stress of the situation.

i second that emotion. have you invented any new words ?
here in upstate new york, &quot;snow &quot; is a four-letter word...

next time, try heat before you put the wrench to those nuts,
and use anti-sieze when you install them...
