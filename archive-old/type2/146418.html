Subject: Metric Conversion for Force

Hiya All,

I'm having a tough time converting some metric specifications for torque to 
foot/pounds or even to other metric figures I can set on my torque wrench.  
I've tried looking for conversion tables or formulas without any success.  We've 
got a lot of knowledgeable folks on The List and I'm hoping somebody out there 
in Listland can point me the right way.

Specifically, I have figures in kilogram/centimeters such as 350-450 kg. cm.  
How does one convert that figure into newton/meters or foot pounds?

Mike
