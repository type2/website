Subject: Re: [T2] What is the hubcap tour box?

It is a box full of trinkets, photos, memorabilia, and a log book that has
been travelling the country for about two years in VW busses.  I don't know
where it is now but I am sure it has been emptied and re-filled more than
once by now.  Pretty cool... I would love to get my hands on it again.

| I've been around (off and on under various email names) for years, but I
don't know what this is.  Perhaps I've been asleep at the steering wheel.
