Subject: Re:  [VB] Is there a min air flow for heat exchangers?

The heat blower sounds great.  

But-   yes the heat exchangers do function to cool the exhaust and thus the 
heads, and the engine will run hotter w/o air bowing through here.  And you 
likely wont turn the heat on in the hot days in summre? 


type IVs have a separate system for the auxiliary blower

I have tried to figure out how I could add a blower in w/o disconnecting 
thefresh air hoses.  Maybe some sort of Y with one side fed from the fan 
shroud and the other from the blower, with a flap in there so the air wont 
blow up the other side of the Y.

The thing though, Is my bus has decent heat volume.    It needs to warm up to 
get heat though, and I need to fix the draft overhead vent.   But then it 
would have awesome heat volume.  hm.....
