Subject: Re: to all the stereophiles out there.. Alpine question...

I'm pretty happy with my Kenwood Excelon KRC-953 that I installed
a few weeks ago.  I think I paid $329 from Crutchfield.  It has
an auto-reversing faceplate, tape, RDS, remote, CD hookup (up to 
two players).  I think it drive 4x35W.  I've got some pioneer
premier 6&quot;ers up front and two Blaupunkt 6x9's in the back (facing
forward in an overhead bin I made).

The remote is pretty handy (it's a westy).  I need to get an
amp to get the Miata speaker seats hooked up soon.

These newer stereos have a few too many buttons to deal with
in city traffic though...
