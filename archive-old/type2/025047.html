Subject: enlarged crank keyway..long
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

hello
I recently had a massive rear seal leak on my recently installed 1800 motor. 
I did some research in the archive and found a post from Linda Bartnik that 
mentioned that AC-equipped motors had slightly longer fan hub 12-point bolts 
to accomodate
the AC pulley. This means that the AC pulley would also act as a needed spacer
when reusing those fan hub bolts. 

When I swapped in this 1800 I had no functional fan hub bolts- so I used the 
ones from the 1700 ac-equipped motor. The bolts were longer, I didn't know 
why. I left out the AC pulley and put extra washers under the 12-point bolts 
to keep the fan bolts from tearing up the rear seal. After about 75 miles my 
fan bolts started loosening up. 
I removed a couple of washers and retightened, forgetting the reason for the 
extra washers. Furthermore, it wasn't until after another test right that I 
check the center 
12mm/13mm bolt under the plastic cap and found that loose, when I retightened 
that and took a short test ride, the rear seal got chewed down to the metal 
from the decreased clearance of the longer AC fan hub bolts, and spilled my 
oil onto the street.

So upon taking it all apart I realize I'm cooked. My hub is so-so, my 
woodruffkey is 
tired and worn down, and worst of all my crank keyway is significantly 
widened. The key has way too much rock when it sits in there. Am I cooked? I 
assume the crank 
must be removed and machined....am I right?

If so, I'm going to proceed building a 2 liter which I recently got back from 
Rimco. Either way, I'm going to try and figure out the proper length of 
non-AC motor fan hub bolts versus AC motor fan hub bolts, and then special 
order a box of hardened bolts. It's worth whatever the cost if it saves a 
total case split and mail away machine work.
