Hello Listers:

I've checked the Type 2 archives, and I kinda know what to do next but some 
hand-holding and reassurance from the list would be greatly appreciated.

My wife and I took the '76 Campmobile camping at Ocean Shores, WA this 
weekend and all was well until the trip home.  The bus started just fine 
after packing up at our campsite.  We stopped for gasoline about 60 miles 
into the return trip and, after fill-up, when I turned the key all we got 
was a &quot;click&quot; from the starter.  A couple of dirt bikers gave us shove away 
from the pumps and we bump started the engine.

When we got home I checked the Bentley manual and performed the &quot;lights on&quot; 
test.  The headlights go out when the starter switch is engaged.  I cleaned 
the battery terminals (even put in a new battery) and still no go.  The 
lights still go out when the switch is engaged.  Where do I go from here?  
Perform the jumper wire test?  Whack the stater with a hammer?  Could it be 
that the wires at the starter might be corroded?

Thanks for any and all suggestions.

Best regards,
Walt Fogle
