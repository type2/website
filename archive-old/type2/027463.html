Dear Bruce.

I fitted a Microdynamics (based in Camberly, Surrey), Formula 1 plasma 
discharge, aftermarket electonic ignition system (frequency contolled dwell, 
contact assisted) to my 1973 VW 1600 Westfalia Continental, back in 1989, 
with good results.

I don't know much about the Sparkrite systems, but I have some of their 
advertising literature, dating back to the mid-1980s. Which system were you 
thinking of fitting?

Regards.

         Nigel A. Skeet

Much modified VW 1600 Type 2 Westfalia Continental, with 1911cc VW 17/1800 
Type 2 &amp; 4 hybrid engine, pantograph rear-window wiper (see VW Motoring, 
December 1996, pp85~86) and much more!

&gt;Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone experience of fitting aftermarket electronic ignition kits to 
&gt;the
&gt;1600 motor?
&gt;
&gt;Ive come across an unused 76 'sparkrite' kit offering contact/contactless
&gt;ignition. It claims to be suitable for the 1600 transporter motor.
&gt;
&gt;Anybody got any reasons why not? (other than the un-authentic thing)
&gt;
&gt;All responses appreciated
&gt;
&gt;Bruec
&gt;
