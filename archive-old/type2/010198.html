Amen, Brother!

Steve's given me sage Bus advise (as recently as yesterday) and helped me
through struggles with my ISP and my computer, all the while keeping his
cool.

Steve, I've thanked you privately, but this is the time for a public
&quot;THANK YOU&quot; for your help as list admin and busser. Enjoy.

Bus content: Drove my Bus today, gonna drive my Bus tomorrow. Life is
good.
