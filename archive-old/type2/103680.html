Subject: LEDS - calling matt roberds, boy genius!

i looked into the LED taillights, too - what i found was the RED ones 
won't show up properly thru the (red) plastic lens, are barely 
visible from the sides, and might not fit the socket or housing 
right. the WHITE ones had similar problems; NEITHER would let the 
flasher box do its thang correctly.
what we need is someone like our resident tom edisons work up a 
circuit that would allow the leds and flasher box to work right that 
is attached TO the housing (so it wires right up at the business end, 
no patching under dash), and then work with someone familiar with 
repopping (jim t, the two ronnies (no, not the british comedy team), 
etc) to make a housing and bezel that works  :)

dreaming,  i know, but there's a fortune out there waiting to be made 
- 2000 listees at say, $150 for a set? i'd buy one. kaching!
