David Ricketts sends:

&gt; I was wondering if anyone has done, or has information on conversion of
&gt; a Vanagon to a diesel engine.  I do realize the water thing, but I was
&gt; looking to see if anyone had done it and what the results were.

Most people who do gas/diesel conversions on Vanagons go from the diesel
engine VW gives you with the car to a Rabbit engine. Yes, it's water cooled.
And it's a huge amount of work.

Aircooled content follows: A German company called Deutz makes an aircooled
diesel. A new one is not going to be cheap and you'd have to become a
backyard Doctor of Automotive Engineering to get it to bolt up to the
transaxle, to redesign the suspension so your front wheels stay on the
ground, etc., but if you want a diesel engine (and I'd like to remain on
topic) this is a path you may want to consider. There's also a Chinese
company making aircooled diesels--a 100hp one was around $3000 last I
looked. And I don't remember the URL, darn it.
