Subject: Can't get the _at_$$#! oil cover off!

Hey all:

I'm slowly tearing apart the junkyard 2.0L aircooled engine I acquired, 
but I'm stuck; well, actually, it's the oil pump cover that's stuck.  
I've taken off the 4 nuts (that's all there is, right?) and I've loosened 
the studs/nuts that hold the case together nearby, but I *CAN'T* get that 
cover off.  I've used a small (~10&quot;) pry bar on it, putting more pressure 
on the bar than I care to contemplate, but it still hasn't budged.

What's the secret to getting this thing off?  Do I just go ahead and 
unbolt the entire case?

TIA.
