Subject: Re: [T2] Valve cover leaks

&gt; If the bale is as hard to get pushed back up over the cover as
&gt; the side that is not leaking, then something else is wrong.

Yep, I'mm 99.99999999999999999999999 % certain it's the valve cover

&gt; Try switching bails from side to side and see if the leak stops
&gt; or follows the bail.  Are you *really* sure it is the valve cover?

I'd really rather not mess with the one that's  not leaking.

&gt; I know you said head and cover are in good shape, but *feel* the
&gt; head mating surface again.  I finally had to use 300 grit wet/dry
&gt; sandpaper on my T4 head to get the old valve cover gasket material
&gt; off enough to get it to seal correctly.  Smooth surfaces are the
answer!

Of this I'm 110 % percent sure.  Both surfaces are smooth and shiney
and have been checked visually as well as given the &quot;feel&quot; test.

&gt; I use 3m weather seal(the yellow stuf) and glue my gaskets to the
&gt; valve cover....not a lot, just a thin bead.  I generally use
&gt; them this way for over 10,000 miles at a time with *no* leaks(on
T1's).

In over 20 years of bus ownership I've never used glue or sealant on a
valve cover, I don't want to start now.  The passenger side gasket is
the original the engine came with 12 months ago.  I've tried 2 new
ones on the leaky side to no availe.

&gt; Cheers, dave

Thanks to everyone who responded.  I'll be getting back to this
problem shortly after the New Year holiday season.  Until then the bus
is parked in the driveway.
