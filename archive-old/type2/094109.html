Subject: Re: [T2] RE: duals vs single carb

I, too, have a '72 1700cc with original carbs.  They are very simple to work
with and are very reliable.  I can buy rebuild kits and other parts when
needed.  I even purchased a complete replacement set from a list member for
$50.  You can even order a set of rebuilds from Advance Auto Parts.  I
recommend keeping the originals.  You could order a rebuild set and rebuild
them to get yourself familiar with them.  I decided that I liked these carbs
after I rebuilt mine.  One problem that folks here have mentioned that I
have not yet encountered is the need to replace the throttle body bushings
when they get worn and fail to seal.

&gt; 
&gt; Sorry,  my engine is a type IV 1700 out of a 72 bus.  As far as I can tell,
&gt; the duals are stock solex.  I was going for the simple approach to keeping my
&gt; bus healthy.  The balancing the carbs seems that it get to be a pain in th
&gt; A**.
