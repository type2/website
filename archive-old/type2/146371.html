Subject: Re: [T2] Replacing the Glovebox

&gt; Look under the dash. There is a thin metal strap that retains the
&gt; glove box. It has a set screw at the end that secures it. If it is not
&gt; already loose, remove the screw, lower the strap, and slip your
&gt; glovebox up, then strap it in.

Okay so I don't have a picture but I am not sure what this strap you speak
of is supposed to look like?

when I look into the hole where my glovebox is....I see no strap(I am
assuming that this strap runs vertically from the bottom middle up around
the back and connects to the top)  If so the strap is not there.

metal tab like think with a hole in it that looks like something might
have been attached at one point.
