Subject: F/U on shifting

Well, I pulled the gearshift lever when I got home from work
last night, scraped all the decomposed rubber and who knows what
else from the base, and did the thing with the small screwdriver
on the shift plate. That helped a bit, but what really helped was
the 5 clicks on the clutch cable wing nut! :)

I had replaced the clutch cable and the little steel bit the clevis
pin goes into in the spring -- I guess the cable had strectched a
bit over the summer.

Here's my nagging concern -- I replaced the cable and the front 
gizmo because the cable was acting like it was ready to fail --
would generate more pedal freeplay a few days after the adjustment.
The gizmo had a very oval hole for the clevis pin. But when I pulled
the old cable, it didn't look frayed.

Does anyone know of any other failure mode with the same symptoms?
I would think that the clutch fork would fail all at once, and not 
slowly bend, making frequent cable adjustments necessary. 

Or am I just paranoid?? :)

Thanks to all who offered help.
