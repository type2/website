Earlier this evening, &quot;Bookwus1&quot; inquired about a source for replacement 
knobs/levers for the heat?/air controls in the dash. For everyone who needs 
some piece of obscure interior hardware, get your costumes ready and watch 
the list next Tuesday because I've got a Halloween &quot;Trick or Treat&quot; to offer 
you!
