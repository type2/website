Subject: Tom Wilson's Book &amp; TDC
Message-ID: &lt;60494dfc.24bb57e4_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I have my newly rebuilt '75 1800 engine installed and trying to get it to 
start. It has the single weber which is getting gas and has spark (no 
comments about putting the FI back on after all the recent posts with FI 
trouble!).

The engine--she no wana start. I historically get the timing 180 out of wack 
on the 914 engines I've built (probably from reading Wilson's directions), so 
I got the pulley at TDC, pulled the dist. out and turned the engine around 
180 degrees, re-installed dist. and it still wouldn't start but I got slight 
backfire thru the carb.

I used Tom Wilson's directions for lining TDC using the punch marks on the 
crank and new reground cam. The fan pulley has the TDC v in the metal and two 
nice white marks for both TDC and a mark 180 from TDC. I  jumped to the 
archives first instead of begging the list, where I read this article:

&gt;Don't believe EVERYTHING you read;&gt;)
22: 
23: Look at your crank and crank gear. The woodruff key cutout in the crank
24: is inline with the #1 rod journal. The cutout in the gear is 180 deg
25: from the timing marks, the timing marks point at the 3/4 rod journals.
26: With the #1 rod at TDC (3:00) the timing marks will be pointing at the
27: 3/4 cylinders holes (9:00), not at the case parting line (6:00).
28: 
29: Set your dizzy at #1, and with the #1 rod to the TDC position, set your
30: crank into the case. Now line up the timing mark on the cam with the
31: marks on the crank.

39: &gt; Okay,  I am in the middle of assembling the internals of my engine.  And
40: &gt; something came up wierd.
41: &gt; 
42: &gt; In Tom Wilson's book, and also my Bently manual, it says that the two
43: &gt; punched holes on the teeth of the crankshaft timing gear should be
44: &gt; straddling the case parting line.  I can move my crank to that position
45: &gt; fine.  But....it also says that the distributor should be at the #1 
firing
46: &gt; postion.  TDC right?
47: &gt; 
48: &gt; So I orient the distributor housing until the rotor is pointing right at
49: &gt; the #1 wire. TDC.
50: &gt; But when I look at my crankshaft, my #1 rod is to about half of it's
51: &gt; stroke.  Not fully extended like TDC should be.
52: &gt; 
53: &gt; What am I doing wrong?  I looked all over my books looking to see if 
there
54: &gt; was a good picture of the crankshaft timing gear and the rest of the
55: &gt; crankshaft, but couldn't find one..
56: &gt; 
57: &gt; So I start thinking that maybe the guys at the machine shop pressed that
58: &gt; gear on the wrong way, but how can that be possible when there is a
59: &gt; woodruff key right beneath it?
60: &gt; 
61: &gt; To help you visualize this a little better, the two punches on the
62: &gt; crankshaft timing gear on in the correct spot (straddling the case 
parting
63: &gt; line towards the camshaft) when the woodruff key for the pulley is 
pointing
64: &gt; straight up along the parting line (towards generator).

Is my timing 180 off and the engine wouldn't start when I tried changing the 
distributor because the valve lash was set wrong based on the wrong TDC? 

BTW, I was doing all this fun stuff Sunday afternoon since I promised my wife 
to take her to her college roommate's son's wedding. I hated to miss Chucky's 
Redneck Campout in Newport even if it did rain most of the weekend.
