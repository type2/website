Subject: Re: [T2] Fixed: Bus pulling to one side

There is also a wierd problem that can happen when flexible brake lines go
bad.. They can pass to the wheel cylinder or caliper, but not allow it to
flow back, thus keeping the brake always on that wheel.. You can tell by
taking off the hose and blowing in both ends. The air will only pass one
way. Jan B
