Hi-

In the process of doing the same myself for my '73 westy, so I've been
doing some experimenting as well.  (I believe the 71's and 73's had the
same interiors.) The closest match I found was by first using a Wood
Conditioner by Olympic, followed by staining of Zar's Country White.  I
finished it off with a few coats Olympic Satin Polyurethane.  I can get
you #'s for all of these if you want.

The Zar's is a thick stain (use a cloth for application), but when you
apply the polyurethane, it tends to lighten/yellow the finish a bit. 
I've decided to go with only one coat of the stain, which results in a
lighter than stock look, but I like that since I like the wood grain. 
I'm also weary of all the experimentation and want to get my panels back
in my bus (going on three weeks with 'em out).  Putting multiple coats
of stain does &quot;darken&quot; the finish, but be sure to let the coats
COMPLETELY dry in between.

I'd be curious to know if you find any other solutions, and what you
actually decide to go with.  Keep me posted.
