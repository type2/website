I'm not sure where you are, but I went to my FLAPS here in Seattle (a =
Big Wheel) and purchased rebuilt calipers for $59 each.  These came with =
all new pads, springs, pins, and we're nicely painted.  I gave them back =
my crusty old calipers and got a full core refund (they only checked =
that the caliper was in the box to refund the core).  It only took them =
1 day to get a pair and they work great!
