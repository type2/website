Subject: Driving with sliding door open, is it legal?

Hello list, 

I just had a quick little question. Is is illegal to
drive your bus with the back hatch up and /or the
sliding door open? I know that this is probably a
topic that is handled differently from state to stae
but I wanted to see what you  would say. Would driving
around with the bgack hatch up mess up its hinge
springs? Thanks!

I appoligize if this is a frequently asked question.
