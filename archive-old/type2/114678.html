&gt;Hm, any advice for getting that thing out?  I can get to the screw on

Hey Steve Dolan! What's your trick?

&gt;(along with the screw on the clamp on the bottom 
&gt;end of the throttle boot, grump). You'd think that when people put 
&gt;clamps on hoses, they'd orient the clamp to make sure the screws are 
&gt;accessible from the hatch.

Typical.

&gt;BTW, underneath the bottom throttle boot clamp, there seems to be a 
&gt;wire plug similar to the injector wire plugs.  Is this sensor output 
&gt;from the throttle?

Yes, the throttle switch...was replaced on later 76 models as a microswitch above and eliminated altogether for 77 and later.
