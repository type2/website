Subject: Re: [T2]Pleee for help please shiftrod 76 bus

&gt; plate and a stop plate with lugs showing in the picture both of
&gt; them...?? one is turned upside down above the spring??? and then
&gt; the other which i have is under the spring and against the
&gt; floor....?

From bottom up: Floor of bus, stop plate, spring, shift lever bracket, bolts.

&gt; also i have done the trick with putting it into second gear and
&gt; sticking a screw driver against the plate while tightening....the
&gt; lugs on the plate that holds it all together....

Loosen bolts, put it in second, then make sure the bottom of the shift lever
is perpendicular to the floor, tighten.

&gt; i can find third and fourth but barely

Push stop plate towards rear of bus to help engage 3/4.

&gt; and also reverse is nowheres in the picture still there is no reverse

Move stop plate L/R to find reverse.

&gt; it does not say where to stick the screw ddriver just tp use one...

To push the stop plate L/R.

&gt; one more time can someone help me with this without thinking i have
&gt; done this 1000 times before...?

This can be a trying experience.  Been there.

&gt; Not only that the part the stop plate is 1.76 part and i cant find
&gt; anyone with one from a good neighborhood....?????????????????????

Wha?

&gt; also why wheni have the gearshifter in fourth can i spin the gear
&gt; shifter...almost like maybe the little key at the bottom of the
&gt; shifter has came out of the front shift rod key slot

Bingo.

&gt; feels like its unscrewing (threaded)

No. The pin is out of the slot, maybe broken off?  Two people helps here to
get that pin in the slot.

Good Luck,

Billy
M'Boro, TN
76 Bus
