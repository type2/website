&gt; &gt; ...does anyone know of a source for the torque converter bushing...
&gt; 
&gt; I've had VW torque converters rebuilt on two occasions. One time I got a
&gt; TC bushing from an automatic transmission rebuilding shop in Capitola, CA.
&gt; The other time I got it from a shop that specifically did just torque
&gt; converters in east San Diego, CA.

that's where I got the last one they had on the shelf.  they told me they
were NLA, and this was one of those central source large rebuilder for the
entire state type places.

BTW they also let me have a rebuilt TC that had been sitting on their
shelves for years that was for my van, think I only paid $50 or so for the
whole thing.  has been in my van for several years now.
