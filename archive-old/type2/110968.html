&gt; you don't have to be a mind reader. item descriptions are within the vendors
&gt; control. you simply put a note on the item description to the effect that
&gt; this alternator uses a different cooling boot which is NLA.

I don't think that a vendor should be responsible for every variation of
our &quot;mix and match&quot; buses.  If a bus owner is going to use non-stock parts
then it is up to that owner to resolve the differences in connecting
hardware.  When I converted my '71 to an alternator nobody warned me about
needing a different fan hub, but I'm not going to get mad at the guy who
sold me the alternator.  He probably wasn't even aware of the difference!
