I know on the SVDAs it doesn't matter if the hose is connected or not, since
it's not activated until part throttle. Not sure on the push/pull units.

&gt; but couldnt you see where it fell after disconnecting the retard hose, and
&gt; time it to that in the future to avid needing to reconnect it every time
&gt; you set your timing?  assuming you are running with retard disconnected...
