So to do it so it will last at least 75k miles or so, I'd figure $1000 in
parts
alone with your jugs to do JUST the engine after getting core stuff and
pushing $2000 by the time you find tin, induction, exhaust, rectify clutch
and bellhousing issues and anything else that would creep up.

I have to disagree with you a little. If you are a scrounge like me, and
find a good used engine, or can find several like I did, it can save tons of
money. I am doing the Cali conversion also, about half done now. You must
use used tin, do not go buy brand new tin just to cut up. I scrounge and
trade for this stuff. All of the conversion type stuff can be made cheaply.
Find good used heads, 1.7 are better than the 2.0l and very often are only
in need of a valve grind. Find a good used crank and have it polished and
the rods checked and reconed if needed. New P's and C's or rering your good
used set.
It can be done cheaper, but it takes time and good scrounging skills. I even
got some dual Webers for nothing.(ICTs)
The clutch bellhousing issue is a non-issue. All that is needed is to have
the flywheel drilled to the size of the pilot bearing and press it into
place. You must use a 210mm flywheel. Any 210mm or 200mm clutch will work
depending on needs.
More and more people are doing it and it is becoming easier as the number of
conversions increase. There are now companys selling parts that Cali shows
you how to make, this is good if you lack skills, but have cash.

Don't be afraid of the type 4, it can be your friend.
