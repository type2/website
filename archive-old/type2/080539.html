do you have an automatic tranny, he could have used manual transmission
half shafts (or vice versa) the half shafts are DIFFERENT sizes and the

&gt; I hope you are kicking his butt!  That is an unheard of screw up!

&gt; 
&gt; Checked gear linkage under the shifter, all the way back and into the
&gt; transmission - all looked good, no loose bolts.  Called my mechanic, he said
&gt; to climb under the back and shake the axil on either side - that was it!  He
&gt; installed new CV joints a coupla months ago and the axil disconnected from
&gt; one of the wheels.  He's on his way over to fix it (a mechanic that makes
&gt; house calls!).
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for everybody's help!
