Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Valve Questions.............

Jeremy,

Whatever you do, *Please* let us know what the machinist had to say about 
the valve, or some pictures of it.

The *only* bad thing about the list is that sometimes folks forget to tell 
the rest of us what was **really** wrong....was it really the valve?  Was 
it the pushrod rubbing on a spring retainer?  Was it the pushrod 
rubbing on on something else? Was the rocker arm failing and causing the 
noise? Did the valve  really go bad in 30k miles?

If the valve stem is failing/stretching, I would expect the adjustment to 
be a long way off of standard...is it?.._dot_compared to the intake on the 
same cylinder?

Cheers, dave

&gt; No, I did not retorque the heads.  The instructions that came with the  
&gt; engine did not include that.  Oh well, what can you do?  Pull the  engine and pull 
&gt; the head I guess.
&gt;  
&gt; Well that gives me a bit of a winter project.  What about replacing  the 
&gt; whole head with a good one that I have?  Is there a problem with using  one with 
&gt; 30K miles and one with 5K?
