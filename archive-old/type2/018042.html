Perhaps y'all can help us with this:

71 bus, 1600cc engine, stock (except for the electronic ignition).  Runs
fine, great freeway mileage but has a hesitation upon acceleration,
especially when cold, especially in lower gears.  Hesitation is
diminished when the engine is warmed up, but is still there
intermittantly.

We just had the carb adjusted, put on the stock vacuum-advance
distributor, engine tuned, fuel pump adjusted, new battery cables put
on, hot-start relay hooked up.  The car seemed to run better when the
hot-start relay was installed (hubby said some of the grounds were
loose).  The hesitation lessened upon installation of the stock
distributor.  The engine tuning, fuel pump adjustment, etc helped a
little, but not much.

This is very annoying.  Our other cars (1776cc '71 bus and 1600cc '69
bug[electronic ignition also]) go when you give them gas.  This car has
to think about it sometimes.

Anyone know what's up?
