&gt; &gt; What engine came standard in a 1973 bus delivered to
&gt; &gt; the US?  Was it a 1700 FI?  From the information I
&gt; &gt; have, it did, but I've been wrong many times before.
&gt; &gt; Also, would it matter if it was manual or automatic?
&gt; &gt; Just wondering...
&gt; 
&gt; 1700, 2 carbs.
&gt; FI did not arrive until 74, and then it was only on the California 1800
&gt; w/auto trans. 75 all states/all trans got FI.

HOWEVER, the 71-72 1700  and  73-74 1800 type 4 engine that was actually
in a type 4 had fuel injection, and it can be used in a bus with little
modification,  I have run a 71 1700 with Fuel Injection in my 78 bus while
it's engine was out getting rebuilt
