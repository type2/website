Subject: Re: [T2] &amp;*^&amp;!!!! oil filter length and removal

From Courtney:

Is it only me that finds the oil filters tough to remove on the 77 Westy?
What brands are people using? Mine is an all black filter can with the VW Audi symbols on the side, but the
*&amp;*&amp;^!!!! thing is just short enough that my wrench can't get a good grip. Is there a longer QUALITY filter
out there??

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

You don't need or want a longer filter.  You want a better tool.

If you are really fighting get the old filter off, then you are putting them on too tight. ONLY go 1/2 turn
AFTER the gasket makes contact!
