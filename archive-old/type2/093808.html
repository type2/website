Subject: spring washer for steering wheel

The Bentley shows a spring washer under the nut the holds the steering wheel on.  My wheel came loose the other day so I put a wave washer underneath.

On my last trip to the junkyard I noticed none of the late bays had the washer there.  I assumed mine was left off after a horn repair in the early 90s but now I'm not sure.

Is it supposed to be there and if not will a wave washer there put undo stress on the threads?
