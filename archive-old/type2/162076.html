&gt; had a  Westy tent and agree that it was a PITA to set up. When I got it I
&gt;&gt; set  it up in the parking lot in broad daylight with all the time in the
&gt;&gt;  world. Took 2 hours the first time, over an hour the second  time.

&gt; Hey Guys  I disagree with these guys on this  I can set mine up  in 20 min. 

I am challenging Mark to a &quot;tent set up&quot; race this weekend !
I know &quot;we&quot; can set up &quot;our&quot; tent in 10 minutes... and have the 'blue sky' 
awning set up over top of it in another 10 minutes.

Come On Mark.... see you in Whitby Saturday! ?? Leave NOW.. sleep when you 
get here!
if you can't make it.. we just might have to do the race via video link!
I am sure Greg can handle that....

I have watched Mark take down the tent.. and gleaned from the experience! 

The tip .... undo the pegs holding it to the ground.. and lift the floor peg 
loops up to the corners of the pole frame,, this will hold the floor off the 
ground.
2 people can move it to the side and leave it to the last thing to pack 
away.
This allows the ground side of the floor to dry off.. then the mud will be 
dust, and easy to brush off...
At the same time.. the debris inside can be tipped out one of the doors.. 
then the tent can be lowered to the ground to fold up. 

 

Mark also said:
having the floor in it is a real blessing when it rains.
I don't think these new tents will ever hold up as well
The extra room is great.
I have used mine with my splittie and vanagon and it works with either.
My wife loves it cause then she can use her pee can in the tent at
campouts instead of having to go outside.   later  mark Dearing
