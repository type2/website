&gt;I adjusted the closet valve on driver's side next, #3 and when I got to
&gt;the other one (exhaust?) the nut was way tight and I proceeded to round
&gt;it.  I am going to pick up a six pronged 14mm socket wrench connector
&gt;so I don't strip any more.  I have spare nuts and screws so destroying
&gt;the nut and screw is a posibility.  My father has a nut cracker but the
&gt;size was too big. Are there crackers small enough for this job. Do I want
&gt;to keep rounding it until a 13mm fits. Doesn't seem likely. I remember
&gt;seeing a commercial for some gizmo that state &quot;even removes rounded
&gt;nuts&quot; Any ideas?  

Time to get out the old Fitzall-Fukzall AKA Vice Grips;-)
