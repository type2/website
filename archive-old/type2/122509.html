&gt; Anybody have any
&gt; experience with the Mallorys sold by aircooled_dot_net?

I have a Mallory vac advance distributor on my '79 bus. If you are ready to
play, it is the best replacement on the market, bar none. You must be able
to dial it in for it to be really worth the cost. That means being
comfortable with tinkering, measuring timing, total advance and so forth.
The unit may need to be removed a few times to install the proper springs
for you application. The reason for all this is that the Mallory will not be
set up &quot;out of the box&quot; for your engine. But it is almost infinitely
adjustable, so it possible to set up the Mallory to have any advance specs
you need. If you want it to duplicate the stock dizzy exactly, this is
totally do-able. If you want something else, you can have it. Any advance
curve you can dream up, it will do it and the adjustments ore quite easy.

There is slight a fit issue, in that if the distributor drive is not
re-indexed, the vac advance canister can interfere with the breather tower.
This is not a major problem, but should be noted. The other down side is the
cost of replacement cap and rotor are quite a bit more that a bosch. I think
any engine I build in the future will use a Mallory, the pitfalls are
outweighed by the advantages imo.
