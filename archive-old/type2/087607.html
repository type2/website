Subject: idle's when cold, then dies


Hi, I just got my bus out for the summer &amp; had this problem when I put it
away last fall.  First of all the engine is a stock '71 dual port w/ a 34
pict 3 carb.  I'll start the bus when it's cold, it will idle fine for a
few minutes then dies.  After that it will not idle unless I step on the
gas constantly.  It also dies every time I come to a stop.  I checked the
archives, but didn't find an exact answer for this problem.  I tried the
idle speed adjustment &amp; the idle mixture adjustment- these did not make any
difference.  I tried closing the choke when it was warm &amp; that made no
difference.  Also, checked the timing &amp; that was ok.  This is basically a
new engine (3000 miles with a brand new carb), the valves were adjusted
just before I stored it last fall.  If you have any thoughts about what it
could be, please email me.

thanks in advance,
Keri
