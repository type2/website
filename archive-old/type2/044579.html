Hey ya'll - 

I think I may have found a running (and in good
condition) bus in California.  Deal isn't done yet,
but I wanted to ask a question...

Would the list membership like to participate in
driving a bus from SoCal to Western New York?  I would
take care of all bus related expenses like fuel,
maintenance costs, food for the drivers.  Only catch
is each driver/participant would send me a little
blurb about how thier leg of the trip went.  Sound
interesting?  I've got a few weeks to finalize the
deal, but I wanted to toss this out to see if it was
even possible.  I'd like to see the cross country trip
take no more than 3 months, but since I'm asking for
volunteers, I can't be too picky.

To prepare for the trip, I'd have the bus gone over by
someone out in CA, then try to map out a route based
on responses back to me with people who'd want to join
in the party!  I'm guessing about 2500 miles (about 50
hours?) Just a crazy idea, but it might work.

Or...I guess I could make it less exciting and just
fly out there and drive it back myself!

Paul
