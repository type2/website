Subject: Re: [T2] New Pistons ?

I stand corrected on my statement of *high compression increasing engine
temperature.*
I yeild to the engine rebuilders with the most experience.

&gt; Higher compression does NOT necessarily increase engine temps. 
&gt; Compression
&gt; must be matched to the cam duration, which for most of the guys on 
&gt; this list
&gt; are stockish busses, which means no more than 7.5:1 IMO. However, I 
&gt; have
&gt; built many engines where 8:1 was too low, and it resulted in HOT 
&gt; running
&gt; engines (experience). Moving compression up to 9, 10, and even 11:1 
&gt; cooled
&gt; the engine down.
&gt; 
&gt; I get a LOT of flak for these statments, since it is contrary to the 
&gt; &quot;Blue
&gt; Book&quot;. However, basic thermodynamics (Thermo I) shows that you are
&gt; converting energy into mechanical motion. The more we convert, the 
&gt; less
&gt; leftover heat we have. After all, how much compression does a 
&gt; furnace have?
&gt; Does it run cool? Why not?
&gt; 
&gt; Increasing compression LOWERS engine temps, PROVIDED (this is almost 
&gt; never
&gt; followed) that you optimize the ignition timing. Some of our engines 
&gt; run 20
&gt; degrees FULL advance, and run quite cool (less negative work with 
&gt; less
&gt; advance). One more thing; increasing compression brings you closer 
&gt; to
&gt; detonation, and once you get there, parts break FAST, so it's not a 
&gt; free
&gt; lunch.
&gt; 
&gt; I just wanted to point out that low compression ain't a cure-all, 
&gt; not by a
&gt; long shot. If you want an inefficient engine that runs HOT and is 
&gt; difficult
&gt; to tune, with low power, build a 6.5:1 semi hemi engine and there 
&gt; ya' go.
&gt; You have to run 38 degrees of timing so it gets out of it's own way. 
&gt; :-)
&gt; 
&gt; The engine is a combination of components, and one change often 
&gt; requires
&gt; changes elsewhere. &quot;low compression&quot; doesn't necessarily give you a 
&gt; cool
&gt; running engine.
&gt; 
&gt; FWIW, we are in the midst of designing pistons (high swirl) that 
&gt; should
&gt; allow 12-13:1 on pump gas aspirated, and 11:1 with forced induction. 
&gt; These
&gt; are designed to squeeze more mechanical energy out of combustion, 
&gt; which
&gt; lowers EGTs, engine temps, and exhaust noise (no combustion in 
&gt; exhaust
&gt; system) to a whisper.
