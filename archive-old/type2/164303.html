Subject: [T2] Looking for fuel injection help (L-Jet)

So Im back at it again, trying to get my stock fuel injection working again on
my 78 Bus..


This is what I know.. (almost certainly)

1. I have fuel pressure (35+ lbs)
2. I have spark (it will start when I give it starter fluid)
3. Injectors just got rebuilt by Cruzin Performance
4. Engine is good, Ive been running a carb until the swap.
5. Timing should be good as well (as above, Ive been running her)

She will start if I spray fluid in there, but then dies..

I DO get the flickering light when I use a test light on the #1 pin on the ECU
plug from the coil.

I DO NOT get a flicker when I test at the injector end of the harness.
The injectors have juice all the time when the key is on.

So why will the injectors not fire????

Theories:

1. Grounded out injector (will that cause it?)
2. Bad ECU (tried another one or two in there)
3. Bad AFM (also tried a couple of them.)
4. Bad wiring harness (just put another one on there)

Im very confused, all the components check out when doing the ohm tests, and I
get the flicker ant the ECU when starting, the grounds test good at the ECU,
but I dont get flicker at the injectors.
I have also hooked up another injector to the test port and ran the harness
injector plug to it and get no spray.

AARRRRGHHH

Questions:

1. Will 1 grounded out injector cause all of them not to fire?
2. What else will cause the injectors not to fire?

Thank you in advance.. Please help.
Aaron
