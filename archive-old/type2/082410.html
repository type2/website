Subject: RE: +AFs-T2+AF0- Re:  shipping  transporter middle 3/4 seat/chair

+AD4- A list member in Texas wants to buy the middle seat from my 
+AD4- 71 transporter.
+AD4- He want's to put it into his 66 bus. I checked with UPS and 
+AD4- their guideline
+AD4- limit is 150 lbs with 130+ACI- for the overall package.  This 
+AD4- seat would weigh
+AD4- close to 100 lbs. +ACo-packaged+ACo- but would be about 170+ACI- overall.

Greyhound has a package shipping service called Greyhound Express.  I used them once to ship a large item from Minneapolis to NC, it was here and 2 days and was real cheap, I think like +ACQ-35.  Go to www.shipgreyhound_dot_com.  They do have size restrictions and I think their weight limit was 100 lbs.  I believe a middle seat may fit within their size restrictions.
