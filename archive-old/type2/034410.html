All,


I think damaging someone's car and fleeing the scene
is unconscionable, not to mention illegal. The fact
that it was &quot;a beater&quot; is no excuse (most drivers
today think of our busses as &quot;beaters&quot;, even when
fully restored). How would *you* feel if you came out
of the store to find your beloved bus with a fresh
scrape/dent and nobody owning up to it???? Pretty
unhappy, would be my guess.

If you have insurance (and if you don't, you *really*
suck), simply leave a note on the car explaining what
happened and give your name, phone and insurance info.

Do the right thing....karma tends to pay back 10-1.
