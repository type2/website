If the weldnut is damage/torn off, you are still left
with the problem of putting it right when reinstalling
the bolt.

On my '71 I can reach the backside from under the bus,
and I don't know if this changed on later buses.  If
the weldnut is missing, you simply replace it with a
hex nut.  If it is stripped, then you can drill the
mangled threads out and use a slightly longer bolt and
a hex nut behind the weld nut.

In any case, use a dab of anti-sieze on the bolt to
prevent this problem in the future.
