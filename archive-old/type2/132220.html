Subject: Gas tank bolts.

Thanks to Michael and Chris for the tips on the socket for the gas tank
straps in my '77.  I pulled the tank without having to pull the engine and
replaced the faulty sending unit.  I did some digging while I was in there
and found the rubber that attaches the filler hose to the tank was about to
give up the ghost.  All the rubber attaching the vent lines was original and
was cracked and fell apart as soon as I tugged on it.

So I'll be spending the weekend putting everything back together...and of
course emailing the group if I find a lost/missing/extra part. :-)
