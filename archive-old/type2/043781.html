Subject: [T2] Here we go again: Glowing red light

Hi Volks,

The subject line tells all.  I have read all the archives and gotten
some great info but...
I am stumped.  The red light in my '70 westy used to glow all the time
at night with the lights on. I replaced the generator with a Super 75
by Kymco and deleted the possibilities of a faulty generator and
regulator.  Now the light only glows when the turn signals, and brakes
are applied.  My guess is a bad ground, but I am a clueless math
teacher.  What do you all think?  Thanks

Auker
