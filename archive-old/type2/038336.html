Subject: Oil Leak

If I have a oil leak that is coming from between the transmission and
the motor, is it more than likely the rear main seal? This is a AVP
engine with less than a 1000 miles, it has always leaked oil from here.
I will be doing the 1000 mile tune up stuff soon and was wanting to drop
the engine so I could determine where the leak was coming from. Any
other places I should look for a leak behind the flywheel?
I did not replace any transmission seals when I put the engine in, I
want to do that also, how many are there and where are they located?

Thanks for any help.

Meredith
