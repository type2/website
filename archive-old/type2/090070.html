There is a GREAT article on LPG / Dual Fuel in the current 
VW Camper and Commericial (Issue Seven).

Thanks,

&gt;
&gt;I am toying with the idea of a dual fuel setup (there is a 
&gt;guy in the UK that has kits for air cooled vans). But to 
&gt;make this worthwhile at all I need more propane capacity, 
&gt;well beyond just adding a second standard sized westy tank 
&gt;under the sliding door (No I dont want to put the tank 
&gt;inside the van, nor do I want a larger or second gas tank).
&gt;
&gt;Must a propane tank be cylindrical to hold the gas safely? 
&gt;What kind of PSI do they hold? My scuba tanks are rated for 
&gt;3000 PSI and I assume they too are cylindrical for 
&gt;engineering reasons.
&gt;
&gt;In an ideal world, laws of physics aside (OK maybe the 
sides 
&gt;could be rounded), I would love to get a tank that was only 
&gt;about 4 to 6&quot; tall x 12&quot; wide x 36&quot; long. This would fit 
&gt;neatly under each sliding door.
&gt;
&gt;What about the possibility of putting two 6&quot; tanks side by 
&gt;side between the fame rails for a total of 4 tanks? How 
&gt;would you link them all together? How would you do a fill?
&gt;
&gt;Just dreaming...
