Subject: RE: [T2] Oil Screen Screw - 2L motor

Regarding what am I going to do... if it's broken and the piece is sloshing
around in the sump - I'll have to rebuild.  

Right now I want to get a better handle on the issue.  I'm thinking that
maybe the bolt was not tightened enough and/or the silicon gasket is not
sealing correctly and I don't have an issue with it being over torqued.  

If it was torqued too much - I guess what I don't want to do is make it
worse - it's only a slow leak.  But then again, if the case has a crack -
it's not going to get any better.  Like I said, I'd like to know if I have
something truly to worry about.

One other question - my oil drain plug is really hard to get out (it's one
of those allen wrench ones) and I'm not sure how hard I should try to get it
out... could I possibly do other damage to the case?

&gt;Where is the bolt for the oil pump?  Are you suggesting that I try to turn

I meant to say oil pickup. The bolt is between the inner push rod tubes.

&gt;I guess I understand what can go wrong... I don't understand how to verify
&gt;if its gone bad already and what to do next if it did - besides a rebuild.

What are you going to do if you find out that it's broken? Tear down the
engine or keep driving?
