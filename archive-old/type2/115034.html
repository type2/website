Subject: Re: [T2] waterproof distributor???

on 5/8/03 18:57, you related:

&gt; Any one heard of one of these? Any ideas how to water
&gt; proof the electrical on a motor , just incase one were
&gt; to be partially submerged, say as in a stream crossing
&gt; or traveling through a large mud hole??????


research vw things and kubelwagens. the military ones had waterproof
ignition systems. the thing distributors and coils are available and will
work on a bus, though they have no vacuum advance. they are also quite
costly. cool looking, though...
