Hello,

I live in Las Vegas and am selling my bus. I would like some help in finding 
out what it is worth and what the market is.
This is a 1970 Type II VW camper van. It is tan in color. I have owned it 
since 1977. It was purchased new by my folks so has been in our family since 
it was new. It has only 103,000 original mises on it, I had to have the 
engine rebuilt at 60,000 so only 40,000 on this engine. Great shape. New 
tires, Shocks etc. It starts up everytime and runs great. I have only put 
about 1,000 miles per year the past 10 years. I use it only to transport some 
on my small musical equipment once in a while. I have kept it  in cover area 
and has good paint and body. 
If someone could get back to me with some advice on what it is worth or how 
to try and sell it I would appreciate it.
