Subject: Gene Berg Oil

I'm rebuilding a 1600DP engine and I ordered a few thermostat and flap
parts from Gene Berg, who has a wonderful assortment of parts for this
application. I needed to get over the $25 minimum order so I intended to
order a few quarts of the 20W oil that I have always bought from them to
use as a first-fill after rebuild.

The lady said that they were now recommending Penzoil 25W-50 for this.  So
I bought a few quarts.

Today, I read the label as I was pouring the stuff in. To summarize, it
says that it is for racing applications.  For high performance street use,
the label recommends two other Penzoil oils.

What do you all make of this?  I understood the use of a thin 20W oil to
break in a newly rebuilt engine. I don't understand the use of a -50 oil.
And nothing on the label suggests that this is what Penzoil had in mind.

Could there have been a misunderstanding during my phone order?

Jack
