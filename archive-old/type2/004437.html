Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch to flywheel bolts on a 75

[...]

&gt; 215mm flywheels, used on 74-75 models had these bolts..7mm....
&gt;
&gt; They are hard to find sometimes, most Porsche dealers have them as they were
&gt; used on 914s..

 I keep seeing 914 1.8 engines laying on the ground in the wrecking yards and I
just walk right by them..... no body wants them.  I will have to grab some of
those bolts....not sure why, I have 210 and 228 flywheels...
