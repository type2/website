Subject: breather lines, now gas heater

Thanks all for the tips on getting the firewall out of my 74 Westy.  I
didn't know about those two screws... 

Anyway, removing the screws that attached the flange tubing to the gas
heater that passes through the firewall gave me enough clearance to jimmy
the thing out without any great difficulty (course, the engine is out so
it's a lot easier...) The 30 yr old breather hose was rock hard, and I had
the thrill of finding the problem to my gas fume smell - the hidden
breather joint in behind the spare tire was totally disintegrated and
hanging loose. Damn, that was satisfying to find the problem! 

Question of the new day is this... 

When I bought the van the gas heater wasn't working, I didn't know why.
Upon removing the firewall it was evident that the gas heater has two
electrical connections to a small black box sitting on top of the metal
tubing that carries the gas-heated air that passes through the fuel tank
area, just to the left of the tank. Those two connections were also
hanging loose. 

The two wires coming out of the gas heater are both green, no markings on
them. I can't see any specific markings on the black box in behind the
firewall either, but it's awful tight back there. I don't know if this
makes sense to anyone, but how do I determine which wire from the gas
heater attaches to which terminal on that box, whatever it is? 

Thanks,
