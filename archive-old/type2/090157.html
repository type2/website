Subject: Re: [T2] Hard Start/Won't Start When Warm

Hello,

I just thought of somthing else. We learned in class
that the the gas companies use different blends of gas
in colder months than they do in warmer months. The
blend that they truck to their stations in the winter
is made to vaporize at a lower temperature than the
gas produced for the summer. Try getting your gas from
a different station when you fill up next. The station
that you are using may still be using up some of their
winter blend. This can cause vapor lock. That is just
a thought. Good luck!

&gt; &gt; Basically, my '70 loaf will start up great in the
&gt; &gt; morning.  After it's
&gt; &gt; been warmed up (let's say I've driven 20 minutes
&gt; or
&gt; &gt; so) then shut off...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; [elapsed time ~20 minutes]
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; ...I try to start it and the engine just won't
&gt; &gt; catch.  It turns over
&gt; &gt; just fine, but it has a tough time firing up. 
&gt; When
&gt; &gt; I go around back and
&gt; &gt; open up the engine room, it smells like gas (and
&gt; no,
&gt; &gt; I'm not pumping it
&gt; &gt; full of gas while trying to start it).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Sometimes, simply opening the engine room door
&gt; then
&gt; &gt; trying  to start it
&gt; &gt; again works.  Sometimes not...now that the weather
&gt; &gt; is warming up, it's
&gt; &gt; become a more frequent problem.
&gt; &gt;
