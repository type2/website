Hello listmembers,

I had the chance to pick up a nice childs cot from someone at a realy good 
price. For some reason, I swear I saw a post here that said the 69 - 73 cots 
would also fit the 76-79 model years, but since it would not fold down I 
would have trouble storing it.

Well it appears I or whomever posted that was wrong. It is about half of an 
inch short, seemingly, from fitting.

Can I rig it to work, or just hope I run into someone with an older bus and 
a newer cot that made the same mistake? HA!

Any thoughts or general laughing and finger pointing is welcome.

Christopher
76 westy &quot;jasper&quot;
