I have been ordering all my parts from Bus Boys and am
very pleased with the service and products.  Though I am in the restoration business and many times order ahead of the scheduled task, I believe maintenance in the form of a routine can prevent all these piss and moan letters about delivery from parts suppliers out there. 1)Dont wait til it breaks 2)if it looks sorry replace it and 3)if you havent replaced it in 3 years maybe its time. And when all is said and done we all sleep better at night.  Last shipment of parts I ordered on a Tuesday, the following Wednesday the parts were at my box.  AND I LIVE CLEAR ACROSS THE WORLD
Way to go BUS BOYS INC..........
Increase the Peace
