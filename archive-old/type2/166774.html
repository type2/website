Subject: Window Tinting Advice?

Hello, I am looking to get my windows tinted on my 73 high top. Do any of
you have experience with this? Any advice would be appreciated. Here are
some specific questions as well:

1. What is the going rate for window tinting on a bus?
2. Are there certain types of tinting that one should avoid due to low
quality / longevity?
3. Is there anyone that you would recommend in the seattle area?


Thanks!
