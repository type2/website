Hello again list, I asked for all 72 owners to e mail me the other week on
what they thought of the 72, thanks to all who replied, and you might recall
that I was unable to secure the bus at that time because the person I
thought owned it was not responding to my calls. Well today I got the name
and number to the party that owned it before him, they had actually given
him the van on the promise that he would fix it up and give them some money
if he ever decided to sell it. He had never gotten the title and since their
had never been a written contract between them and the promise to fix the
van was broken I was able to buy the van. She still had the clear title in
her name and signed it over to me. The only thing he is out of is a towing
fee, that I will pay back to him, and he let a good van slip from his hands.
The owners also had another van they sent to a junk yard just 1 week ago, I
had asked him for their name and number 3 weeks ago when we first talked, he
was being deceitful to those people by not giving it to me, and I lost
another 72 van that they would have given me along with the westy. At least
I have the title and plan on getting it from where its been sitting for over
a year now on Wednesday, then the fun begins.
I only paid $400. for a complete CANCER rust free bus, sure it has some
surface rust but no rocker or floor damage at all. Also the carburetor was
giving the p.o. a fit and he couldn't keep it running. He said he had bad
compression on 2 cylinders he thought, running ruff and black smoke coming
out.
I do have a question that I couldn't find in the archives so hope you folks
can help.

1. Since I have never paid attention to a carburetor on a 72 engine what
kind do I need?
I don't have the engine number yet so not positive it's a 72. I saw on the
bus depot sight they carry them but couldn't find a price, any one bought
one lately, how much?

2. He said the engine did run but poorly. If I can get a Carb and get the
engine running what should I look for to determine he good, or bad the
engine is?

These are probably way to early to be answered, but I hope that's all that's
wrong with it, the Carb being off and all. Anyhow look forward to an update
when I get it home and get some numbers to be deciphered.
Thanks to all that can help with the questions.
