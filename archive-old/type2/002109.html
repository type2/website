&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt;    I am looking for some information regarding what it would take to put a
&gt; 1600 engine into a 74 bus.

Well Paul,
since you asked If you can, not if it was the most powerful thing. Yes VW
did install Type 4's in N America but in other markets Europe in particular
it was only an option with the majority sticking with the 1600. Yes it can
be done.  And if you already have 2 complete running engines.  I would say
you will get out cheaper that way.  Even if They last 60,000 each. That is
120,000 total. ncbus wrote a page up on the subject

with pics even.  Thanks Chris.

Peace Brother,
