Subject: Re: [T2] Electric heaters (was Driving in Snow....)

&gt;Lowes has dropped the price on the buddy heater (Mr. Heater Portable Propane
&gt;Heater) from $84.00 to $75.00.

I'm using one for heat in my garage to knock the chill off. Isn't quite big 
enough for a whole garage but it will get the temps up 20-30 degrees after 
an hour or so with freezing temps outside. Good enough for me.

Will it work in a moving vehicle? Dunno - mine shuts off if I kick it by 
mistake.

Very economical on propane. I run mine off of a BBQ tank. I have run mine 
for 100 hours so far on a BBQ tank...

If they get cheap enough I'll buy a second one for later in case mine ever 
dies. I like mine that much...
