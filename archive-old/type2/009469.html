  It's me again.  Thanks to everyone for advice on the stereo wiring, I got 
it installed last weekend.

  Now I am trying to get this 71 Bus through emmissions.  The problem is 
that they won't even test it because I can't get the idle low enough.  In 
Washington State the idle must be below 1100 RPM to test the vehicle.  Well, 
the lowest I have been able to get the RPM by turning the little screw is 
1300 RPM.  So what else can I do to lower the RPM on this thing?  I need to 
get it legal and this is the last step now that I have installed the new 
muffler and air filter.

  Thanks,

  Brian
