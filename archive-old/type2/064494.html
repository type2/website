I absolutely agree on this. Steve Tokar and I are currently taking a 
class on VW repair, and the guy who is teaching the class is a *good* &amp; 
*honest* VW trained mechanic with over 35 years experience with VW's. 

He's currently rebuilding a T4 engine from the ground up, and he's going 
to charge $3000 for it. My jaw dropped when I heard this. I mean, 
shheeesh, them's a lot of clams for a VW engine. Granted he's using all 
the right parts in it, and doing a quality rebuild. But that's a lot of 
money.

I think, though, upon reflection that we have to look at what mechanics 
currently charge ($75/hour) and extrapolate that out to the time spent on 
a decent engine rebuild.
