The PO of my bus thought it was a good idea to put rhino liner type material
in several parts of my bus.  Anyone have any suggestions on how I can remove
this tar like substance besides using a dual action sander?  Any suggestions
appreciated.......

Justin,

I would think a sander would be among the worst things to use.  Once that
Rhino liner gets heated up, it will gum up your sandpaper very quick.  Maybe
use a flapper-type sander or a putty knife?

Paul
