Subject: Re: [T2] exhaust

Yes. But to elaborate more it is because of where the exhaust exits
the exhaust exits the muffler that is the problem, not how it works. A
beetle exhaust will spit it out in the back, right in the little
pocket of air that is pushed back towards the bus. What happens is
that if you have less than perfect seals exhaust fumes will get in
your bus &amp; possibly be harmful for you. The true bus muffler exits to
the rear, but way to the right side, so that it is out of that pocket.
