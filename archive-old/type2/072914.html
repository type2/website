Subject: last friday's thread - a final tally????
Message-Id: &lt;v02130504b36209fa5ce1_at_[208.240.161.25]&gt;

So did anyone (including the originator) actually TALLY the employment
thread, or were we all just whizzin' in the wind??
I can sum it up for ya:

WAAAAAAYYYYYYY too many computer folks ;)
a few teachers
some students
a smattering of state and feds
a few unemployed
a few unemployable
some happily selfemployed
some unhappily
retired folks of all stripes
just a few mechanics - and we listen to the REST of you? =O)
some clown who runs a record store

oh yeah, and some hippies!
