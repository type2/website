Subject: unidentified wire....

--=====================_889472414==_

Hi everyone..i have a wire that i'm curious about, that i'm not able to spot in the bentley diagrams. 
it's a black wire that's bundled along with my oil pressure switch wire. and it runs to the positive side of my coil. this is how my engine was hooked up when i first got it, so when i put in a new engine, i reconnected all the wires the way they previously were. but i just don't see it wired up this way in the bentley, so i'm comin to you all(again) for a possible answer.....
does anyone know what this wire goes to? 
curiously tryin to understand how these Veedubs work;)
