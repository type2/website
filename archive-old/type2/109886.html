Subject: Re: [T2] Paint Removal

&lt;&lt; Never having attempted this before, I am trying to
remove the exterior (multi-colored) paint off a '79
bus with limited success.  I have used the Aircraft
stripper and now using a vibrating sander with 80 grit
paper, again a slow procedure.  Now is there an eaiser
DIY way or must I accept the spray/scrape/sand/curse  
time intensive method currently employed?

Tks in advance

You're probably working outside...And if not you should. 
Try laying the stripper on and covering it with a sheet
of saran wrap to prevent its evaporation...Let the re-
mover have time to work; don't do its job for it...
