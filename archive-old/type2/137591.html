&gt;You've already noted the pressed-in mount bolt on the bellhousing flange

Just to be clear, that bolt still is inserted from front to back, and it 
screws into this flange.  I'm off to the hardware store this morning to 
pick up a new bolt.

&gt;The reason for this is that the '71 has a doghouse cooler that makes
&gt;getting at that nut rather difficult.  The cooler needs to have a duct
&gt;that passes through the '71-only front engine tin, so make sure that those
&gt;parts are in place.  If you leave the duct off and simply dump the oil
&gt;cooler air in the engine bay you will compromise your cooling system.

Ah, I was wondering about the tin.  It has the opening for the oil 
cooler.  There are also 2 other pieces of tin with it.  I'm sure I can 
figure out how it goes together, but I have to admit I was curious about 
the whole thing.  Thanks for the tip!
