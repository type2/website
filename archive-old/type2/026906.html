Hi Folks,
   I don't know how to say this without sounding like a whiner and 
complainer, but here goes.  If you are organizing an event, show, campout, 
whatever, how about sending it along to the coordinator of the Events page 
at Type2.Com for listing there.  That way we all don't have to keep  
separate lists of web addresses for the various events.  I know there are a 
number of events planned for 2001 already, and it would be soooo nice to 
have one place to look for them all.  I'd even be willing to help maintain 
the Events page if someone can teach me how.  OK, rant over, thanks for 
lending me your ear.
