Subject: Re: Tool question

Herewith, my humble opinion.
1. Screwdrivers, box wrenches, pliers, channel locks, vice grips, get halfway 
decent stuff, but don't break the bank. Sockets [6 sided for tough stuff- 12 
is okay if everything is pristine and well oiled]  and such, get as good as 
you can afford, but no lesser quality than Craftsman or some like it with a 
replacement guarantee. Snap-On, Mac, and the like are quite good quality, but 
ya pay for it. 
2. The difference between 6 and 12 point is ease of getting it on a hard to 
get to bolt, traded off against the more frequent chance of rounding off the 
socket. If you want to use 12 sided on a rusty old exhaust bolt, you might as 
well just throw the thing away new. Under the dash, where everythig is [or 
should be ] fairly decent, 12 is fine.
3. Swivel sockets, deep well sockets, allen bolt sockets, and the more 
esoteric stuff is nice to have, and if you frequent thrift shops, pawn shops, 
yard sales, etc., and you happen upon some at a bargain price, by all means, 
jump on em. But, to equip your tool box with all this stuff from the Snap-On 
guy [if you can even get him to talk to you-they are notoriously stuffy] can 
cost you more than your bus did. I have a complete set of all of this stuff, 
but I inheirited most of it, and some of them I have NEVER used.  When I buy 
for myself, I go for the somewhat better grade of Craftsman, and have had no 
trouble with them. 
By way of explanation, I do most of my own work on my bus and pick-up, and 
used to be a mechanic in a Honda Motorcycle shop a couple of lifetimes ago. I 
don't mess with my wifes car much, though. Can't get under, around, or hardly 
into her Integra. 
that's my HO, FWIW.
