Subject: Re: [T2] water injection (was alternate fuels)

&gt; &gt;  he has a water alcohol injection on the
 intake, which does nothing they are claimed to increase gas mileage etc.

&gt; Water injection is used to curb detonation in high-compression race
engines.

I have been wondering what happened  ese tins.  When I was in my high
hormone years, say 20 years ago, you couldn't open a hot rod mag without
seeing half a dozen ads for water injection.  Now they're passe.  I wondered
if it was due to the availability of efi and computerized ignition.

Always seemed kind of odd to me that one would try to increase the
volumetric efficiency with a supercharger, only to have to take up half the
volume with water vapor, but I'm sure the numbers crunch out differently.

Regards,

Grant
