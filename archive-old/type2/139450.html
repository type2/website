Subject: Too many questions?

I get the sense that maybe I'm asking too many questions.

But consider the aim: I want a bus in my driveway that I could climb 
into on a moment's notice and drive from San Diego to Bar Harbor, Maine 
and back with just an oil change in Bar Harbor. No &quot;can it make it?&quot; No 
calls on AIRS. Just driving, looking at the scenery, and listening to 
Allman Brothers on my iTunes.

And if I can do it, anybody can do it.

Mark
