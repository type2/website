&gt;Subject: Sway Bars and Shocks

&gt;I've got a '76 Bus and have been gradually repairing and replacing items to
&gt;improve the handling in cross winds.  I've replaced the tires with new
&gt;Yokohamas and installed new ball joints, tie rods, and a few other
&gt;suspension bits.  This has improved the handling quite a bit.

 Todd,

 You've already done most of the things that will make the most significant
 improvements in cross winds.Check also for excessive play in the steering 
 box too and adjust that if there's a few turns left on the grub screw.

&gt;
&gt;However, on really windy days with gusts over 30 mph, the bus is still a
&gt;handful at highway speeds.  I was contemplating adding sway bars and
&gt;aftermarket shocks.  Has anyone else found this to be helpful with cross
&gt;wind handling?  How difficult is the installation of each?


 Yes they will help too,to a lesser extent but you'll love the way the
 bus handles in normal circumstances.
 Good quality after market shocks like Bilstein,Koni etc are the key,
 not something ordinary on special.You will get what you pay for.
 You will of course potentially harshen the ride so bear that in mind.

 Good ones like the above brands are re-buildable so can last the life
 of your bus and beyond.
 Shocks are easy to fit.Put the van on stands (one side at a time)
 take the wheels off (makes it easier) and you'll see how simple it
 is.Of course if you have a hoist available it's even easier.

 Stiffer sway bars are good too but only fit a rear if you've already
 upgraded the front one.Otherwise the bus will behave a bit strangely.
 The reduced body roll is nice but you will compromise traction on
 rough roads,especially with a rear bar as you reduce suspension travel.
 But if 99% of your travelling is on good surfaces then look into it
 if your wallet allows.

 Installation is again pretty easy and straight forward but without
 access to a hoist to enable you to raise the van to a comfortable
 work height it's a bit of a PITA lying on the ground with the van on
 ramps.But if you like dirt falling in your eyes or dropping spanners 
 on your face then go for it...

 There also should be plenty of info in the archives on this topic.
