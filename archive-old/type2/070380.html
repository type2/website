Subject: Yet another engine fire!

        Yep, I had one too, this morning.

        My generator siezed up, and caught the belt on fire!  I saw the red
light on, a lot of smoke, so I decided to pull over.  The fire was probably
much bigger before I pulled over, what with being fanned by the wind and
all.   I was able to blow the fire out, and use a water bottle to put out
the rest.  $70 for a tow home :(

        The generator had been making bearing noises, and was the only thing
I did not replace when I built this bus (if it ain't broke...)

        So, I bought a generator and regulator from Kragen, but took them
back: the generator looked awful: the commutator had been ground down
something awful, and it had crappy black paint all over it.  Theirs was
$125, Buck-Formance wanted $140, and I ended up getting one at Pozzis VW
(the very definition of VW-FLAPS) for $117.  All of these included the
regulator.   I also had to buy a new fan, because somehow, mine got all
hogged out where it attached to the generator.  I had a new pulley in my
spares, but it turns out I've been lugging a 12V pulley around all this time
:(  Had to use the old one, but I put new shims in.  Hopefully they'll
exchange the other pulley.

        Got everything put in, taking the warmer part of the afternoon, and
the engine compartment is _much_ quieter now!
