&gt;Way to deflect dude.  I just think VW's attempt at water cooling the Vanagon
&gt;is evil. Lame system, lame design. Obviously you did too.

I thought it was a great way to deflect! Nothing wrong with the VW 
water cooled, it's just different engineering from the air cooled. 
The Subaru is better engineering than the VW. It's not a good-bad 
thing it's just different.



&gt;I agree with you. If you did the work yourself you saved a bundle and IF I
&gt;owned a WC Vanagon, I'd do the same thing.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I've been in both worlds and I still think your 3 ac for less than
&gt; &gt; one wc conversion is the beer talking....
&gt;
&gt;Now that's just cheap. I spend half an hour, no beer, and do your research
&gt;challenge and THAT'S all you can come up with? I proved my statement but
&gt;rather than verify, you just think it's beer talking?
&gt;Look on the
&gt;Samba...it's all there. Or are you too lazy? I was actually wrong...I could
&gt;buy 4 to 6 running AC Vanagons for $16.5k.

It was your statement to prove, I know it's bs.

I did my last Subaru engine (with out labor) for $2109.87, here is a 
West from the 17 or so I found yesterday on craigslist 
&lt;http://seattle.craigslist_dot_org/see/car/283716303.html&gt;http://seattle.craigslist_dot_org/see/car/283716303.html 
for $3200, that takes it to a bit over $5300 for a Subaru powered 
West. That's all stock (sort of anyway, within the confines of 
putting a Subaru 2.2 into a VW), 130 hp of dependable motor that 
looks like it belongs in the back of a VW. Could do it for less with 
a better selection of Westies but it could cost a bit more with a 
poorer selection of Subaru donors. I guess the $5300 is as good a 
real life guess as any.

Most of my experience is with the ac motors and I never expected to 
get 300k out of one, I expect that with the Subaru.

A little shopping I'll bet you could get 10 ac Westies for that 
seventeen thousand dollars!

I suspect that we are arguing apples and oranges, both fruit but both 
different.
