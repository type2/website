&gt;Driving slower will greatly improve your highway milage in a bus. The BEST 
&gt;fuel consumption rates I have seen in the westfakia have always come from 
&gt;runs made below 60MPH. Driving faster than 65 will increase the gas 
&gt;consumption by about the same rate as the speed increase.

I ran some tests a few years ago to try to figure this out.  Here are the 
results:

Test conditions - no wind, temp 39 degrees, 10W30 Mobil-1 synthetic oil, 
tire pressures 37f, 40r Dellorto DRLA40 dual carbs with 140 mains, 180 A/C, 
high-roof bus with 27x8.5x14 tires.  Speedo verified accurate to within 2%.

Test was run on the freeway at night (no traffic).  Very gentle rolling 
terrain, 10.8 miles North, exit and U-turn, 10.8 miles South.

Run 1: steady 60mph 1.234G = 17.50mpg
Run 2: steady throttle, avg 55mph (range 50-60mph due to rolling terrain) 
1.107G = 19.51mpg
Run 3: Spirited driving, 65-70mph, steady throttle where possible 1.352G = 
15.98mpg

The gas station I was refilling at stopped accepting my credit card after 
the second fillup - fraud prevention tactics I guess.  :-)

I also found a run I did a couple of weeks prior.  60mph 2-way average over 
60 miles.  52 degrees, 8mph head/tailwind, 20W50 Royal Purple synthetic 
oil, Main jets were 140 but A/C jets hogged out to ~210 (by PO).  3.336G = 
17.99mpg.  The conditions were different enough for this test that I can't 
draw any real conclusions from it.

I regularly beat these mpg figures with the stock carbs, which are back on 
the bus now (after 20,000 miles with the DRLA's).  I have logged my fuel 
usage since 1996 (98,000 miles!) and my best mpg ever (all highway driving) 
has been about 21.5mpg.
