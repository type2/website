Subject: Re: winch on a bus
Message-ID: &lt;PGBKFPJMGHFBCAAA_at_theglobe_dot_com&gt;

One of the best all-purpose devices for general getting around, out of mud, camp leveling, and underbus checking is a pair of 2x6's temporarily joined with a wooden dowel and then cut into a ramp-type angle. When joined, they are useful for ramps; when taken apart, they store easily (made to fit under a westy seat or cabinet).

Not on the order of come-along or a winch, but if a hefty wench comes-along to push, they're just the right thing to get out of the mud. ;) 

Another temporary dealy I used to have in my first bus ('70 westy) was a pair of angled, emptied wooden speaker boxes. I put them above the engine compartment and laid a wooden board on top of them. Then I filled them with tools and parts. Carried just about everything I needed there and it was handy to get to stuff. The board supported the mattress at an angle and I spent MANY, MANY nights sleeping there, comfortably. Nothing to do with winches, but there was this one w*nch...sorry, I'm not *that* sexist; I just couldn't resist the cheap pun.

Thanks! Joe

&gt;&gt;&quot;I probably wouldn't be stuck in the mud right
&gt;&gt;now if I had a winch mounted on the front of my bus,&quot; I mused.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;If not a
&gt;&gt;winch, what else would be a good emergency plan for times stranded in the
&gt;&gt;boonies?
