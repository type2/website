Subject: Type III Ghia-Reason for Insanity? -Reply

Type IIers:

Can I talk Type III here?  It *is* still VW-related.

I found an ad for a '64 Type 3 Ghia, $1000, no rust, rebuilt engine, needs
interior work.  I've been a glutten for Type II punishment for several
decades now.  Would I be insane to take on finding hen's teeth parts for
one of these?

If the body and trim are complete, it might not be that bad as far as
interior goes to fix.... stock parts would almost totally be out of the
question unless you can find a Type III Ghia specialist... But a custom
interior wouldn't be that bad...
