Chris,

If I knew at 20 what I now know about VWs, I might still have my first 
Beetle (selling a car because you can't replace a generator bushing is 
something that a person can come to regret).

My theory is that, if you can latch on to someone who is prepared to give 
friendly, knowledge based advice (as opposed to BS advice), without 
expecting anything more than respect and appreciation in return, you 
should be able to rebuild the bus.

I have rebuilt motorbikes and cars with advice from qualified mechanics 
who meet the above criteria. I have repaid them with my custom when 
there's something I can't or don't want to do (like getting the tune just 
right) and the occasional six pack at Christmas (with chocolates for 
their wives).

That was before I discovered this list. Now I have a friendly mechanic 
AND the list.

Go for it.
