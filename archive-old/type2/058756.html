&gt; I suggest you remove the cover plates over the pushrod tubes and high off

&gt; on those tubes to twist them as you pull them back thru the holes below the
&gt; rocker arms.  Should be easy with old seals if any crud is blasted out.  If
&gt; any refuse, don't use visegrips, but try a heavy duty duct tape over the
&gt; tubes and create an ear you can yank on.  I've also heard of using a
&gt; tapered broomstick hammered in that allows some grip.  When at the pool
&gt; store today, I noticed one can get rubber plugs with bolts in them and a
&gt; wing nut that allows the plug to expand- these if sized right could be
&gt; placed in a pushrod tube for pulling or inserting?
&gt;    When the o-rings are newly put on, resist the temptation to whack on
&gt; them unless you can turn them as you tap- otherwise you can cut the o-ring
&gt; edge or it may even pull out and pinch, creating quite an oil leak!

I have found that using a pair of the Sear's Robogrip pliers on pushrod
tubes allows more than enough grip on the tube without crushing them in
the least. It used to take me an hour to get old pushrod tubes out. With
the robogrips, it takes less than two minutes.
