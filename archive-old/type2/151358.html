Subject: Plaid material for sale

I have two sets of upper bunk covers and one of the lower rear cushion 
cover. Also a a few scrap pieces from
previous projects. Both sets of upper bunk covers are in good shape and 
have no fading. The rear over the engine cushion has the typical fading 
to one side. All five pieces plus the scraps for $150 plus shipping. 
Paypal accepted. All are the yellow / green plaid from a 78 79 sage 
green westies.
