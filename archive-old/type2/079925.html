&lt;&lt; Also, stated value is a problem too in that insuring an item for more than 
it's worth is usually illegal in that you have an insurable interest only up 
to the item's value.  In other words, you may still be arguing, suing etc.  &gt;&gt;

With State Farm Insurance, you base a stated value policy on an actual 
appraisal.

It would seem to me that having a signed and dated appraisal on file complete 
with pictures that was done when I had my bus polished up, running and 
looking its best is going to make it a_LOT_easier to negotiate a favorable $$ 
settlement than if I wait and try to establish value on it based on local 
newspaper adds when its sitting smashed up or burned out in the mud behind a 
garage or on a back lot somewhere.
