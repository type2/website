Subject: Re: [T2] VW Parts - JC Whitney???

&lt;&lt;  Quick question.... I haven't purchased a whole lot of parts from
JC Whitney before, but what I have gotten, I've been pretty satisfied with.
I understand that the JC Whitney catalog has a decent selection of
Volkswagen parts. How would you guys rate their parts, particularly
suspension pieces and whatnot. I plan on rebuilding the suspension in my
BUS. I also need the steering components (center-link) to my 81 Bandit, just
curious what kind of quality they provide. &gt;&gt;

If you read the small print on the J.C. catalog, they tell you up front
that what you get may be from whoever is supplying them on that
date...J.C. shops by price (as do all mass merchandisers), so if there's
a cheaper whatever available wherever, that's the one you'll get...It
has nothing to do with quality. You can get lucky and get good stuff,
but it's just luck. Besides, dealing with the VW vendors who subscribe
to the list keeps them in business and keeping them in business keeps
your Bus in business...
