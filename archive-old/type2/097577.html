Subject: Re: [T2] More starter problems

[...]

&gt; OK, now I am really confused.  I have now been able to
&gt; spin the starter with a screwdriver.  I have also
&gt; checked voltage coming from ignition wire and that
&gt; checks out at 19V so it isn't my ignition switch, I

19 Volts?!?

&gt; have checked the braided wire going from one of the
&gt; big terminals to the starter and it gets 11.5V, but
&gt; still the cylinoid just clunks when I either bypass
&gt; the ingition with a screwdriver or turning the key.
&gt; So, what are the possible causes of the cylinoid not
&gt; engaging the starter motor but still engaging with a
&gt; clunk?

Bad solenoid. When you apply 12v to it:
the coil builds a magnetic field and pulls the plunger towards the cable
posts. The plunger is mounted to a pivot that moves the drive towards the ring
gear. The other end of the plunger hits a spring-loaded disc that then
contacts the head of the upper battery cable bolt and the head of the bolt
going to the braided starter wire. Every time the disc make contact, lots of
amps pass thru this connection. This will eat away the heads of the bolts, eat
away the disc, and cause a build-up of corrosion.

&gt; Also, the other blue wire that is a slip on
&gt; type that connects to the cylinoid doesn't get any
&gt; juice from turning the key, but is it supposed to?  I
&gt; think this is the wire that goes to the coil.  Just
&gt; trying to figure what I need to replace to get the
&gt; show on the road, there's skiing to be done!

This should be the wire going to the double relay to run the fuel pump when
the starter is engaged.

Replace the solenoid. [not a cylinoid :)]
