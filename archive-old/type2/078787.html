Subject: Do you have this? 


Hello List,
I am in need of a piece of sheet metal from an old,
68-79, junk bus. I need the driver's side rear window
sill. Here is a link to a picture that shows exactly
what I need.

Just high-light the whole link and copy it into your
address box.

The cut edges do not have to be perfect, just close to
the picture. So, if anyone has an old junk bus that is
no good but has this piece of sheet metal in rust free
condition, please let me know how much you want for
this piece of metal. This piece of metal can easily
but cut out with a Saws-all. Thanks!
