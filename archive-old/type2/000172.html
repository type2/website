Subject: seats anyone?
Message-ID: &lt;0.d7c97dc2.254a7a0d_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Anyone interested in green plaid bucket seats out of a 76' westy or a pop-top 
canvas from the same westy.

Two black benches middle and rear from a 73' bus and two black front buckets 
also from the 73. 

Seats and canvas are in a  junkyard near me. the yard is crushing all its 
cars out in the next few weeks and i don't want these parts to go to the 
crusher if someone needs them. i am located in N. IL and i would want the 
person to come here to get the parts i will pull the parts and everything but 
will not ship seats. well i could ship the buckets if the price was right. 
Canvas is also shipable. 

Make me an offer on the seats and i will go bargain with the yard and get 
them for you. All seats are in pretty good shape. I beleive the 76 plaid 
seats need new cushion but i a really don' t think there any tears or 
anything. Canvas has a small tear on one side maybe 3 inches in width and 6 
inches down very fixable rest of canvas is good. Please let me know by sat if 
all possible thanks.
