Subject: Got The Engine Out

Thanks to all the Volks that replied to my posts yesterday about pulling my 
engine. I finally got the damm thing out around 10:30 last night in the 
dark. But now it is sitting on my garage floor waiting for a diagnosis 
tonight after work. Looks like the clutch plate fell apart, I can put my 
finger through the hole in the pressure plate and move the disc around, it 
seems it isn't being held on by anything at all.

Cheers....
