Subject: Re: [T2] muffler heat?

Scott and others that replied...

Thanks guys, It does get hot enough to not be able touch soon 
after I stop.

I have some aluminum sheet and might see about making some sort of added 
shield after I extend the dumps and see if it makes a difference.

I have added some aluminum shielding on a bug and had it make a 100 degree 
lower difference in the temp of the std sheet metal 3 inches away.

Scott, I think your physics is correct...and just learned this again the 
other day.  Left some chromed sockets in the noon day sun next to a darker
metal handled tool.  I could not hold the sockets in my hand(too hot) 
while the black metal tool was hot, I could still hold it.

Thanks a bunch, dave

&gt; my rear bumper gets hot also. not sure i'd say it gets REALLY hot, but it is
&gt; hot to the touch. i have 72-74 system on my 79. i can't remember how not it
&gt; got before i switched over, as i too didn't drive it much.
&gt; 
&gt; i can see the muffler getting hotter with a 72-74 system than with stock
&gt; 75-78 or 79. the exhaust inside the muffler on the stock setup takes a much
&gt; longer path: it has passed through the elbows, plus the crossover before it
&gt; enters the muffler, so 75-78 muffler exhaust should be cooler. i would also
&gt; not be surprised if the shiny stainless muffler you have radiates more heat
&gt; than my matte black one, or a stock gray painted one, though i am not
&gt; certain if my physics is correct on this point.
