Subject: [T2]  vw bus bumpers
Content-Language: en

Hi all,

I had this submitted to me for inclusion on the commercial links page of the 
VW Type 2 Owners Club web page (www.vwt2oc_dot_org_dot_uk) but as it clearly says on 
the page we only do links for UK based companies but I though it might be of 
interest to folk on the other side of the pond.
Claims of uniqueness are rather exaggerated as these bumpers are still 
available in steel or Fiberglas, and price seems rather high....but if you 
want a bumper for a 67 to 72 then it could be of interest.

Good luck

&gt;  information. Also find cost and how to order if any of your
