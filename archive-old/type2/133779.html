How NOT to clean an FI harness:
carb cleaner was a very very very bad idea.

Exactly Mike. Carb Cleaner will clean almost anything. If you sit over a pan 
of it and take in all of it's excellence it might even feel like it has 
cleaned your clock. Pow! I almost did this a couple of weeks ago. Started 
thinking this being the only harness I have and it is delicate. Filthy to 
say the least. Castrol Purple Power and a little warm water. Presto cleaned 
harness. Tooth brushes rags and hang dry. I did however use a little acetone 
on the connectors' contacts, but very lightly. Seems to have worked great, 
will let you know once I finally get it installed.

TravelOn,
