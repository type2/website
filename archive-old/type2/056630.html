Subject: Brake Pulling

Hi Fellow Listee's - a while back i wrote about the brakes on my 70' bus
pulling violently to the right when trying to stop even after replacing all
front wheel cylinders, master brake cylinder and shoes. I received many
kind responses suggesting i replace the front flexible brake lines.
Following this good advice( i should have replaced them anyway) i replaced
the lines, tested line pressure-ok- and still ended up with the same
problem.  So - i decided to check the rear brakes, which is no small task
for me, and found the left wheel cylinders leaking badly.  The brake shoes
were soft and mushy.  The right wheel cylinder showed no signs of leakage
and the shoes looked almost perfect. Both drums were ok, but since they've
been previously turned, i'm stuck with them for now.  Great i think - i've
discovered the problem - the left rear brakes do not work.  There was no
exterior sign of the big leak in the left rear cylinder.  The rear seals
were ok - not leaking. The problem is that the rear brakes, including
cylinders, were replaced less than 2,000 miles ago.  I never figured the
rear brakes would be bad.  I can only blame the wheel cylinder since it
seems that it failed.  In fact, it probably failed shortly after
installation. The lesson here is that sometimes parts fail. Stuff happens.
After replacing the cylinders and shoes - and the rear seals just 'cause -
the braking improved greatly.  The beast still pulled grossly to the right
though.  Enough to bother me into taking another look at the front brakes.
The shoes on the left side had a rather funny look to them.  There was a
streak about the width of a quarter running right down the center of the
shoes.  Now, i know about brake shoe contamination and how to avoid it.
I've done this many times on many cars.  Clean, clean, clean. I then pulled
the right drum and found the streak on the shoes in exactly the same
locations.  The odds of this happening this way must be huge.  I took the
shoes to a trusted mechanic and he said that they were most likely
contaminated at the factory. He said that it happens every so often and
usually in batches. Stuff happens. After replacing the shoes the problem
went away.  The good side to this is that i have great brakes right now. I
learned a lot about what can contribute to an shadetree mechanic's graying
hair.  Good luck all.
