Subject: WTB:Spare '64 14&quot; bus rim

A fellow busser (too mobile to be on the list) requests: (e-mail him )

&quot;......, would you mind putting a notice on the Type
II list, saying WANTED:  good used 14&quot; wide 5-hole bus rim and tire, to use
as spare for 64 bus.
I think the 14&quot; rims were very plentiful, and I would expect to pay about
 - $20.00 for a good rim and used tire?
