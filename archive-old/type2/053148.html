Subject: 30/31 Carb

I am putting a new 34 pict 3 carb with dual vacuum advance.  I cannot wait! 
while at the mechanic he tried to get me to buy this 30/31 pict carb cuz he 
had one from a bug he purchased for parts.  He said the customer just put 
the carb in.

I prefer the 34 with vacuum advance.

Its in the portland, Oregon area.  If anyone around here is interested I can 
forward you his number.  If he sells it to you for what he'd said he'd give 
it to me for, its a pretty good deal.

No shipping.
PS:  In Search of a tent for 71 camper.

Nothin left to do but smile, smile, smile!!
