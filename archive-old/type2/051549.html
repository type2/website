Subject: [T2] '68 electric s.o.s.

this is one for the books. if not yours, certainly mine. i am having a
wailin' time getting my electric right, and am appealing for help from the
list before i shelf the 68 until i can wimper to the auto electrician with
big money i don't have now.

the deal is, i had tested the generator at two places: autozone and a
reputable auto electric shop. the regulator was swapped out. wires are
correct. an ammeter was hooked up and i determined that no current was
heading beyond the starter wires. therefore - no drain. here are the
results...

1) generator light not on at first position, red light on and stays on at
all revs upon engine turning over. 2) battery has been charged and the
vehicle has been driven for 10 minutes. voltage drops from the battery, and
overnight the vehicle has 6 or less volts, as if there were a drain. the
battery is only three years old, and came out of my wife's running car. 3)
i hooked up a new ground strap to the tranny, and new hella reverse light
switch on the nose cone. still, no love at the #15 fuse leading to the coil
- but, the wires check out since i clipped the switch with a wire to the
new ground strap. got the test light on where the fuse would be, yet no
reverse lights come on. 4) the blinkers haven't worked and the emergency
flasher is staying red, it comes on and stays. 5) headlights and front
blinkers come on as one with the headlight switch. there may be one or more
things i forgot, but i didn't want to drown anybody with the whole
enchilada.

i am concerned about the generator light working in the opposite fashion.
it doesn't come on when i ground the bulb wire at the regulator like it
should. but the green oil light does come on (happily).  the other main
concern is the drop in voltage once the jumper cables come off a good
running vehicle. if i turn it over, run it a while, turn it off, all lights
are dim. i can't ell what's related and what can be done just in the name
of getting this 68 running. i am appealing to all you electric specialists
out there to share insight with me. i'm not giving up!  - steve
