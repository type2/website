Subject: Re: [T2] Fw: Gauge Calibration a duex

OK I'll venture in.

I've had several sets of VDO gauges and overall they are accurate.
The fact that it drops below Zero is that it doesn't have a stop pin for
the needle like your speedo.
If you're getting anything above 7 psi at 800-900 idle you're OK.
Its even OK if it takes 30 seconds for it to start registering first
thing in the morning as long as it gets on up after the engine runs for a
few seconds.
I've got a 9000 mile rebuilt engine and I'm still running 20-27 Psi at
idle, 45-50 at 2500 rpms, 50-65 psi at 3300 rpms, all at full operating
temperatures of 350 CHT and 210 (f) oil temp.
The oil gauge is a handy monitor if you're not running a CHT and Oil Temp
because you'll get a slight drop when your engine begins to run hot. Its
actually more accurate than an oil temp that takes about 4-5 minutes to
average out and register on the gauge.
