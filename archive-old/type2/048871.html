To make life easier I have a set of front seats for sale in the Tacoma area.
They are a light brown basket weave vinyl type cover, with headrests.  They
just didn't quite fit the tracks my 77 Riviera.  The lady I bought them from
said they came from a type 2 but didn't know the year.  I can email a
digital photo of them, top and underside to any interested purchaser.

&gt;&gt; ...I just finished removing the covers and pads for
&gt;&gt; both seats and it's pretty clear that doing the driver's seat is not
&gt;&gt; going to be much fun.  This is because the back of the drivers seat
&gt;&gt; won't lay flat because of the recliner mechanism unlike the passenger
&gt;&gt; seat that will.  It's pretty obvious that when the seats were originally
&gt;&gt; made, they were covered while they were still in two pieces.  After they
&gt;&gt; were covered, they were riveted together.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; If anyone has any good tips for making the recovering of the driver's
&gt;&gt; seat any easier, I would sure like to see them.
&gt;
&gt;What I did was to drill out the rivets.  After I recovered the seats, I
&gt;replaced the rivets with fine-thread SAE bolts and nylock nuts.  Works
&gt;fine!
