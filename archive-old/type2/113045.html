Subject: Re: [T2] Correct cam gear backlash (mechanics only)

Absolutely true, diff cam gears had diff no's on them. You can do a test
yourself by lying the crank and cam into the one side of the case. Turn the
crank slowly both ways and check if the cam wants to lift out of it's bore.
If it does, then the cam gear is wrong. However, having said that, it is now
virtually impossible to get the no'd cam gears anymore. If anyone has them
maybe Gene Berg does, but other than that, you are going to have a tough
time. Why not use the stock gears you pulled out of your engine in the first
place? They were a matched set.

Subject: [T2] Correct cam gear backlash (mechanics only)
 
I'm &quot;restoring&quot; the engine in my 1970 bus which I bought new in Nov 69:
New SP heads &amp; case (Brazilian), original std std crank, I need a new cam. I
am concerned about the backlash on the cam gear which come in different
sizes (+1, 0. -1, etc). An engine guy told me he fitted 19 cams once to get
the correct backlash.
I don't have access to 19 cams so I wonder if anyone has advice on this?
Someone suggested I take the left half of the case w/crank to the local
FLAPS that has an engine rebuilding guy and let him fit a reground cam for
proper backlash.
