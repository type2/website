Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Fan Shroud and flaps &amp; covers

How thick? I found some sheet rubber that is about 1/4&quot;-3/8&quot;. That I can cut 
to fit pretty easily.

Thanks,
Michael Knight

&gt;For a cheap and easy solution that will last many years, get some of the 
&gt;RUBBER weather stripping from Home Depot, cut to fit, clean the surface of 
&gt;the covers very good, and stick in place.  NOTE: This is the RUBBER 
&gt;stripping (with little grooves in it), NOT the grey foam-rubber stuff.

I used bicycle tube rubber cut appropriately
