Subject: Where shud I start off(related restoration)

I am new at this, I would like to hear out from your experinces where I
should start off to restore my bus. My bus has a lot rusty area(mostly
bottom area). The both side of rocker &amp; inner strength rocker are busted
so are the cargo floor also the driver &amp; passanger floor. The both side of
front arc are kinda rusty too. Oppisite of battery tray are holed up !
RUST IS MY NUMBER ONE ENEMY!  Top of surface on the bus has rings rust.  I
have all the frigging equipment to work with. So where do I start? The
rocker? I rather to work on the easy area to tough area. Any feedback
would be appericated!
