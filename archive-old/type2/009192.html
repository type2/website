Hi all.
My 74 westy came to me from Longbeach California, with coil over shocks, 
been there for 60k miles now, i think they are due for replacement, but they 
havn't given any trouble.

&gt;Here is how to solve the question:  How many list members have successfully
&gt;used the coil-over shocks, and how many have experienced unsuccessful
&gt;outcomes?  Only those with actual first-hand experience should respond.


my ICQ# is 4652936
