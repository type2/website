Steve,

Regarding bushing availability (assuming we're talking about a '68-'79 bus),
the front bushing on the rear shift rod (211 711 179) is available through
RMMW in the US.  When I replaced my bushings a couple years ago (my shifter
rattled badly primarily due to vibration transmission from worn engine main
bearings), I bought this bushing from Just Kampers in the UK because it was
not yet available here in the US.  

The rear bushing on the rear rod wasn't available then and still isn't for
all I know EXCEPT from: Jim Thompson (who's apparently frolicking around the
US at the moment :).  He reproduced this rear bushing (211 711 185B) last
Spring and sold it in a kit with the front bushing, but he's the only source
I know of for that particular bushing.  In its place I used a front bushing
on the rear of my rear rod and that has worked well for me.  It entails
either drilling a second hole in the shift rod to accomodate the second tab
on the bushing, or removing one of the bushing's tabs with a razor blade.
My write-up on things shifty lives at:
http://www.type2_dot_com/rvanness/transmis.htm

You're right about the forward shift rod (&quot;peace pipe&quot;) slop.  I haven't
figured out a cheap fix for improving the fit of the shifter ball into its
socket that doesn't require a mill or a lathe.  It would be nice if that rod
were available as a quality reproduction.

I also found much sloppiness at the hockey stick.  It wore at two places
along its shaft where it moves through the nose cone bushings.  

I can't say for sure which fix I made that stopped the vibration.  In my
case, replacing the engine was a big step (!), but as to which bushing or
rod was the primary cause of movement at the shift lever, I can't say for
sure.  I replaced everything that looked worn while the transmission was out
from inside the nosecone forward (except the &quot;peace pipe&quot;) and the shifter
doesn't rattle anymore.  

Nearly all of us with '68-'71 buses are driving around with a 30 year old
front transmission rubber mount (211 599 201A).  I don't know of any vendors
selling that one new.  I suspect a fresh one would go far toward damping
vibrations.

&gt;Sean wrote me privately about a shifter rattle that was driving him
&gt;bonkers.  I am posting my response, because I I have the same problem and
&gt;would love to hear a solution.  My take on the problem is that it is a
&gt;combination of factors, worn bushings, wear in the trans, and the ball and
&gt;cup getting worn over time.  Replacing the &quot;shuttlecock&quot; guide bushings
&gt;on the shifter rod would help, if anyone made them.  Replacing the shift
&gt;coupler does help, but is only one step in the process, and it seems a bit
&gt;extreme to rebuild the trans for an annoyance.

&gt;
&gt;Sean,
&gt;
&gt;The shifter in the '73 rattles as well, and I don't know what the solution
&gt;is.  filling the cup with grease lasts about a week.  I think the real
&gt;problem is just age and wear.  The cure is to dig up a NOS shifter and
&gt;&quot;peace pipe&quot; (my name for the forward section of the shift rod).  Since
&gt;that isn't really possible, I have wondered if getting a roll of teflon
&gt;tape and wrapping the bejeesus out of the ball might not help a bit.  The
&gt;other (non-classy) solutions are that I have found that pushing the shift
&gt;a *hair* out of gear will quiet things for a couple of minutes so I can
&gt;get my sanity back or that it may just be bungie time :-)
