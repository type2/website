Hello everyone,
It looks like I may soon be purchasing a 78 westy and parting with my
76.  Before my 76, I had another 76 and I kept the engine and parts from
that one.  Now, I'm probably going to take the engine and tranny from
this one too.

Since the three engines are not the same, what should I do?  The 78 is
hydraulic, one of the 76s is a rebuilt (17,000mi) with a full complete
working FI system, and the last 76 is the original engine from which I
stripped the working FI (~160,000mi).  Should I keep the 76 engines or
part with them?  I was thinking of keeping the rebuilt just in case the
78 goes out and then I can swap while the other gets fixed.  Or, should
I keep all of them, and get the original 76 rebuilt?..

any suggestions?

later,
Mike
