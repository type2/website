hydro-electricity doesn't pollute in a traditional way, but the noise, the
disruption of the ecosystem, and the materials needed to build it do
pollute.  there is also a lot of pollution from inside (the lubrication of
the turbines, and the hydraulics associated with making it all work).  i
studied hydrology in college and researched dams. alot of times they aren't
as great as we think.  they are better in alot of ways than traditional
electricity plants.  i am also a pessimist and tend to think that nothing is
really good enough, except for my buses!!

bus content:
i wrote the group awhile ago regarding my 71 westy.  i was losing power alot
of power while driving.  many people suggested the distributer, and they
were right.  after trying to fix it myself, i took it to Verner's here in
boulder, co.  it looks like the distributer is completely trashed.  they are
putting a new on in it right now.  i just wanted to say thanks for the help
troubleshooting.

Moore, Michael R sends:

&gt; zero emissions just means the car doesn't  emit.  the commercials never
talk
&gt; about how much more is going to be emitted from the eletricity plants that
&gt; have to power these cars.
&gt; 
&gt; all we do is go from a bunch of smaller polluters to a couple of really
&gt; large pollulters, unless we are able to move to renewable energy resources
&gt; to power the plants.

It depends on the part of the country you're in. Many of the folks in the
Northwest, as long as they're not shipping it all off to California, get all
their electricity from hydroelectric generators--dams. This doesn't pollute
at all; the dam either has a pipe coming out the bottom of it or flows over
a roller, the water turns turbines, the turbines turn alternators, the
alternators turn out enough electricity to keep you going. Some places have
big windmills, and they work fairly well too.
