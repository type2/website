Subject: RE: [T2] brake switches

&gt;  I was looking at brake switches (113-945-515G) and the 
&gt; Brazil units are $5 while the German ones are $30. Ouch. Is 
&gt; everyone buying Brazil units?


There are many cases where it pays to spend extra for the German part,
but I can't say that I have found this to be one of them. Our return
rate on the Brazilian ones has been next to zero.
