Subject: FS:  72 westy (in e.tn)

Hello listers,
I have a 72 westy that I really need to sell.  My two daughters have grown 
too large for this van to comfortably accommodate our needs.  I do not, and 
had not planned, to sell but function must prevail.  I need vanagon westy to 
suit our space needs.
Here are the vitals on the 72:
     -1700cc engine(clean as a whistle, runs strong)
     -original, near perfect upholstery(rear bench and nav. seat)
     -ice box, stove and sink(all there)
     -all cabinets in very good shape
     -the front seats are pretty worn
     -the body(orange of course) is in good shape(some minor rust)
     -canvas will need to be replaced soon, as well as the hammock
     -turn signals do not work
  Thats the short version.  E-mail me for more info.  I will have some pics 
soon (tomorrow) if interested.  I have found a vanagon here in Knoxville 
that is a peach!  I need to sell fast.  I thought I had an exhaust leak 
about two months ago, but a visit to the VW doc fixed all that.  This is a 
good bus.  I paid 2500 for it and would like to get as close to that as 
possible.
Thanks for your time,
Rex Hargrove
