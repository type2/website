Subject: Re:New Book Examines Volkswagen's Nazi Years

&gt;Okay, it is true that Hitler talked to Ferdinand Porsche in late 1933
&gt;about designing a car cheap enough to put automobiles within the reach

        And Porsche took the job, but never really believed that he could
make a car as cheap as Hitler wanted, just paid it lip service.

&gt;of everyone who wanted one.  The &quot;Kdf-Wagon&quot; (as Hitler called it) went
&gt;on to become the beetle we all know and love.  But the truth is, by
&gt;1945, no actual production of Hitler's &quot;People's Car&quot; had taken place
&gt;(except for about 600 of so).  At the end of World War II, the British
&gt;appointed Major Ivan Hirst to take charge of the Volkswagen factory.
&gt;
&gt;When he arrived, the factory was heavily damaged by air attack.  It was
&gt;really Ivan Hirst's incredible efforts that turned the factory and the
&gt;company around and got production of the beetle going full swing.
&gt;
&gt;Personally, I give more credit to Ivan than Hitler.  Just my view...

        Yep. However, the intense road testing and engineering that the
Nazis paid for (as a war vehicle investment) paid off very handsomely. No
commercial venture would-or could-spend that much cash on testing and
research, without some sales of a mediocore product to generate income.
Hirst et. al. turned it around, but they had an excellent product to start
with. So what was more important, the Chicken (Hirst) or the Egg (Hitler)?
My thoughts are it's a Ying and Yang thing, both needed equally for the
whole picture.

Peace,
