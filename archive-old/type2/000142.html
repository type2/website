Hey my bus started running crappy this morning!  I was wondering if my fuel 
filter would cause this sluggishness and slight backfire?  It only seems to 
happen in the low gears and I know the filter needs to be changed but is was 
to dark when I got home to do it.  Also I had to add some oil after work, you 
know the usual amount!  and inside thier was a white film. I think someone 
else had this problem last week.
Well thanx guys and gals!
