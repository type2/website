Subject: Online Bus Raffle? (was Re: Who's going to Jerome?)

&gt;* big raffle, grand prize: 1959 7-door panel bus (fixed up quite nicely)

Hey, that's my kind of raffle!  Still daydreaming from the last vanagon list
thread on listmembers pooling together and buying a VW repair business, I
say &quot;we&quot; do a yearly online bus raffle event.  To make it interesting for
the nonwinners we could have these rules:

- --The raffle bus will be mechanically sound with the exception of one
carefully sabotaged component (e.g. a loose head stud).  The winner will get
$50 cash bonus toward gas money if they discover the sabotage during a timed
inspection before departure time.  If while they are on the road the
sabotaged piece begins to fail, only subtle hints will be allowed via the
mailing list to the broke down &quot;winner&quot;

- --The winner will have to drive the bus home and report back via the
internet at predetermined checkpoints.  Hints regarding the location of the
sabotaged piece will be given in the form of a riddle when they reach each
checkpoint.  The farther they get without a breakdown, the less subtle the
riddles will be.

This gives the raffle an extra element of &quot;chance&quot; and frustration (two
painfully familiar companions to bussers).

Ok, it's sadistic, but I'll volunteer to do a test run of the idea..
