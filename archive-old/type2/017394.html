Subject: Air cleaner for my PDSIT/2 carbs.

Hola amigos !!

I was out for a few days and found a ton of mail (almost 200) and I'm
reading to catch up.    I post some time ago the I was needing the air
cleaner for my carbs.  My model is the square paper filter element  part
#. 021 129 620 (hope this can help and it can be seen in the Haynes
manual #266) .  It has been impossible to find even a similar one here
in Venezuela and the new Kombies and Vans imported from Brazil and
Mexico come with different filter model.    If any of you can provide
same, please advise.  Probably Ron at the Bus Depot can help ?? or any
other source in reading.

Thanks and very best regards.
