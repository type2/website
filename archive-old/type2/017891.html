As of today, I am the proud new owner of a 1972 Adventure Camper.  85k
miles on the original 1700 Type 4 motor with dual carbs.  This is a high
top coversion, with a large fiberglass top installed on the roof.  There
is some damage to the top, where it looks like the previous owner hit
something overheard.  The previous owner says the bus is 8' tall, I have
not verified that.  Certainly won't fit in my garage.  I am 6'2&quot; and I
can stand up straight inside.  Lots of storage in the top.  Interior is
in great shape and complete.  There is a sink, two burner stove, icebox,
4 tables, and bed in back.  I guess you would call the bed a U-bed,
since it folds backwards over the engine compartment.  Only minimal
surface rust in a couple of locations, I can't find any rust anywhere
else.  Even the battery tray looks new.  The bus had not moved in over a
year, I put in some gas, charged the battery, and it fired right up!!! 
The price, condition and camping arrangement of the vehicle were enough
to make me forget, or at least ignore, that it is a '72.  I have never
seen another Adventure camper before this one.  After posting on the
list a week or so ago for more information on these conversions, I heard
back from several people, most of whom also said they have never seen
another Adventure camper.  

I guess what they say about VW's multiplying is true.  My hope is that
now that I have 2 busses, they don't start to multiply faster!!  And to
everyone who emailed me about their Adventure camper, thank you.  The
information you provided was very helpful in my decision to buy this
bus.  

I will try and post pics on a website as soon as I can.
