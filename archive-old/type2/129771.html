...... magic that I can use to
get the wire attached so my horn works. TIA TBear
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
If you find the magic and get it attached, and the horn still doesn't work, 
you can consider using a marine horn that runs from a cannister of 
compressed gas....available for 5-6 dollars at most hardware stores 
anywhere near a recreational body of water. They come in several sizes, all 
hand-held and very portable. I seldom (never?) use a horn, but it is a 
requirement to keep the bus street legal. I keep it in the space below the 
driver seat.
