Subject: Re: [T2] seats question

my 79 has spots for head rests but instead has small trim caps in those
places (since I don't actually have the rests) Also on my 79 the carpet
above the engine is only the size of the metal. the seat has a similar
material on the back.

&gt; The rear most seat for a '79 is the folding rear back. I think it had
&gt; brackets to detach and fold the back down and maybe even a longer rear
&gt; carpet that covered the back of the seat. I think that they also had head
&gt; rests.
