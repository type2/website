After replacing the original engine of my bay-window with a 1641cc unleaded,
I am interested to know what kind of top speed in mph I should expect out of
her once the engine has been run in. At the mo' I'm not taking her over
50mph.
Also, will the addition of a set of better carbs gret me any more power, if
so how much....and is it worth it ?
With thanks and greetings to y'all
