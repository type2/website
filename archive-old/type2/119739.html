Subject: Re: [T2] vacuum, PCV hose &amp; carb tuning

UPDATE (regarding the missing hose): I received a response from the
provider of the pictures on the link:
---
well, this hose is a &quot;breather&quot; hose (over pressure from the engine
goes into the air cleaner carying a bit of oil also):
http://www.benplace_dot_com/weber/weber4.jpg It goes from the breather box
(black,  top of engine) to the under side of the air cleaner box, what
you call the &quot;BIB&quot; (i guess) is simply a plastic elbow. Go to NAPA or
any other auto part, ask for a 1/2(Inside Diameter) &quot;&quot;&quot;oil resistant&quot;&quot;&quot;
hose, about 2.5 feet.  They will also cary all kinds of elbow
adaptor...

It doesn't sound like a real participant in the vacuum issue. I'll be
&quot;carb cleaner&quot; vacuum testing next. Any suggestions?

&gt; The behavior I'm experiencing is rough running and choking
&gt; when I step on the gas at low RPM - to the point where the gas pedal
&gt; acts like an engine brake. When the choke was active, this behavior
&gt; wouldn't present itself until the bus was warm. Now that the choke
&gt; has been disarmed, this behavior is ever-present. 
&gt; If I'm heading down the wrong road in my diagnosis, please let me
&gt; know.
