&gt;I now once again have the '75-78 EGR filters available, for
$119.95. (They
&gt;had disappeared from the market for a while.)  Also have the
'79-83 versions
&gt;for about $30 more.

Does that mean that the filter I have in My dad's basement is
worth a little something?
Or do you have to change them periodically?
I think I have the pump and everything.
