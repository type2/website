Subject: key switch gone bad?

Hi volks

No kids last nite, nice romantic evening, off work early...
go to a nice little resturaunt and then.. the bus wouldn't
start.. to be more exact the key wouldn't turn more than
half way in the ignition. The steering wheel isn't locked
but I have no lights, no power etc.
It's a 74 Westie.
So I call a friend and we pull it with 4-way flashers on.
Not very far, not very fast since it's an automatic.

What's my best option with this problem. I tried wiggling
etc etc. Do I have to replace the whole ignition assembly
as outlined in the green book? And find another?
I have a 78 parts bus out in the boonies but it would be
nice to not have 2 different keys.
Ideas?

James
