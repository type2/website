Subject: Re: [T2] Fair price for instrument panel?

Well, I'm down on $bay. I've bought four things through $bay in the 
last 30 days and haven't gotten one of them yet. Different reason in 
each case, and I'm sure I'll get them eventually, but for the privilege 
of buying something in town, from someone who will hand it to me, I'd 
gladly pay more.

Anyway, the question was &quot;is this a fair price&quot; and the answer is yes, 
absolutely, it's a fair price. It's about what you'd pay at a used 
parts place. The fact that you can get something substantially cheaper 
does not make it an unfair price.

&gt; I agree with John.  You can buy three of them off $bay with shipping 
&gt; and spend less than $100.
