Subject: Dipstick Tube seal?

Hey all,

Does the dip stick or dip stick tube on a 73 normally have some kind of an 
o-ring in it to keep oil from burping out?

My engine, due to high crankcase pressure, keeps ejecting small quantities of 
oil out the filler tube and dip stick tube. Shouldn't the crankcast vent 
release that pressure? Thanks.
