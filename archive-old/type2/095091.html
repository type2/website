Subject: Re: [T2] Calling all carbd 2.0s



&gt;Visit your FLAPS and look at the specs on a mid-eighties Japanese carb'ed 
&gt;car.

Any FLAPS that can order a fuel pump(depending on the primate behind the 
counter), can get a small, universal  rotary pump from that catalog.  C.B. 
may be selling the same part under their name.  Good call, Chris.

	Eron
