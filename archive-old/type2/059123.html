Subject: RE: removing distributor

&gt; I wasn't able to get the distributor off my '79 Type II engine. Even with
&gt; an offset box wrench, even if I CAN get the wrench on the nut to the right
&gt; of the disty, I have no way to turn it. Does anyone have any tricks on how
&gt; I can get this thing out of my motor?
	[...]
	How I do it is using an open end - box end wrench.
	I stand the wrench on end so it is in line with the axis of the
bolt, and the open end 
	prongs are straddling the head of the bolt. Then I stick a
screwdriver through the 
	box end ring ans now have a sort of T handle wrench. Cheesy ASCII
