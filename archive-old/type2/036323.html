Subject:  Headliner Removal ????

Dear friends,

    I was going to attempt a headliner removal and transplant this weekend.  
I have never tried this before.  I have questions.

Is this even possible?

How can I do this without ruining the headliner?

Has anyone ever attempt this type of surgery before?
(headliner transplant)

What do I have to do exactly?

I know someone out there has had to have tried this so give me knowledge oh 
great list.  By the way it's a 73 bus with a sunroof.


Peace
