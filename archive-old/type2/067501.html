Subject: CV joints stuff

As those who have just read my previous post will recall, I've just
dismantled all four of my CV joints.  They were working fine, I just
decided since I went to all the trouble to take em off, and since the boots
were starting to crack, I'd go ahead and re-pack em.

So anyway, got em all apart.  The hubs are really pitted on one side of
each of those grooves where the balls fit.  The balls look great.  Trouble
is, it seems that the pitting is on the wrong side.  That is, I would
expect that the pitting would occur on the same side as the direction of
rotation (is it clear what I'm trying to say here?), but it seems that is
not always the case.  I'm thinking maybe I just forgot which way they went
as I took em apart.  Can I ask yall: which side will the greatest wear
happen on?

Is it OK, if the other side is OK, to go-ahead an use the CVs (the body and
balls are fine, just the hubs are screwed) just flipping them around?  A
while back, the CVs were making noise, I just shot some grease up in there
with the grease gun and needle and they haven't given me any indication of
trouble since (no play in the right directions, plenty o' play in the right
direction).

I don't suppose I can just purchase new hubs can I?

Hoping I'm not going to have to spend too much more money...
