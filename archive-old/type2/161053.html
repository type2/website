Welcome, once again, to the improved land of California.

&gt; Anybody got any tricks or suggestions fo rmy 78?

&gt; I tried shoving the thing all the way in, but then the nozzle gets  
&gt; stuck.
&gt; Holding the accordion tube by hand defeats the auto shutoff. Bleh.

You need to find the correct angle and sometimes pump it slowly.  
There are some gas station chains that don't have them. ARCO might be  
one of them.

I used to have more trouble before I changed the retaining plate to  
the unleaded variety:

Since I painted my bus, I keep a wad of paper towels jammed under the  
nozzle and watch for it to get wet so I don't run any gas down the  
paint.
