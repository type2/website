Subject: Re: [T2] Weird Oil Pressure Light Issues

I hate to be the doomsayer here but my only experience with a persistent oil
light became a pressure problem with the main bearings no longer functioning
at any minimal capacity.  This usually coincided with stalling and some
overheating.  I had a VDO gauge hooked up as well to confirm the low
pressure.  Could be something to consider before pushing it along.
