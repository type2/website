Knock, Knock!
  Who's there?
Connecting Rod.
  Crap!!!!

No HCBF for me. While heading up the mountain on US 421 the 
unsettling sound of a rod beating itself to death brought the trip to 
an abrupt halt. Thanks to Roy, Chad, John, Jim Henry, H. Steve Dolan, 
Nikki Elko and the Canadians for pulling over to check up on me and 
keep me company until the roll-back arrived. I was really kinda of 
funny. At one point there were seven buses parked on the side of a 
mountain in front of a little house having pleasant conversation. I 
wonder what the poeple in the house were thinking?

Back to the drawing board.
