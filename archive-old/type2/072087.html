Subject: Tank size 79 Westy?
Message-Id: &lt;l03130301b35bf52d0b0b_at_[207.194.197.146]&gt;

I know I should use the archives, but my old computer is very slow, so I
beg your indulgence:

Does anyone know the capacity of a 1979 Westy's fuel tank, preferably in
liters, but any other measurement would do nicely.  My sender works, but is
a bit wonky, and I'm figuring the tank is near to 60 liters, but I'd like
to know exactly.

TIA,

Roger
