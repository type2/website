Subject: Re: [T2] avp longblock..am I nuts?

I too have a new AVP rebuild. There are three holes on top and one more up
near the flywheel end.  There are bolts that go all the way through these
holes which are used to attach the intake manifold and various FI
components.  I suspect the bolts also have some structural purpose.  When
you remove the manifold from your old engine everything will become clear.
