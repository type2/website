Subject: Voltmeter and wiring and sticky readings.

My voltmeter often sticks at 9volts (it's lowest setting which it rests at
when key is turned off) and won't jump up unless I give it a tap on the
glass. That isn't what is bothering me though. What I'm worried about is
that the voltmeter has the current going through it to my battery and is in
effect stopping it from being charged when it sticks like this. Anyone care
to enlighten me? I know that one honking big wire is on one terminal behind
it, and the other is on another, which to me, says the current is going
through the gauge itself. Any wire wizs out there?
Thanks,
Courtney
