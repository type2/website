your English is better than my Dutch
&gt;  
&gt; A month or two later, we found this 1800cc, flat type 4 engine and installed it into the bus.
&gt; When I fill up the carbs with fuel, the bus will start at a very high rpm and die after 30 seconds (depending on how much fuel I put in). The engine does turn over but won't start when I don't fill the carbs with fuel.
&gt; What could be the problem I'm dealing with ?

no fuel getting to carb.

check fuel pump
      fuel filter. 
      fuel lines (change em anyway)
      power if electric fuel pump.

take gas line off carb, then crank the engine while directing the gas line
into a container BE VERY CAREFULL. see if you get gas.

it is for sure your fuel system
