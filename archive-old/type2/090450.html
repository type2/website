Subject: Re: [T2] I Smell Gas Fumes on Mountain Passes

I spent a Fourth of July in Leadville, CO, replacing the fuel lines to
the canisters (the evaporative cooling system).  I had replaced every
inch of fuel line the prior year, except for the three or four pieces
in the evaporative cooling system.  How'd I find the leak?  Well, there
was gas pouring out after I filled up.

The point being, it might smell only at high altitudes NOW, but you
never know when it's gonna start leaking.

Have a great Fourth everyone...

&gt; This is something I've noticed over the years, but have never been
&gt; able to diagnose or fix (maybe there IS no fix):
&gt; 
&gt; When I'm driving my '79 bus with fool injection over high mountain
&gt; passes, I sometimes smell gasoline fumes near the top of the pass.
&gt; Once I'm over the top of the pass, the odor goes away until I'm near
&gt; the top of another high mountain pass. This happens only on huge
&gt; passes like Monarch Pass (11,312 feet) in Colorado, which climbs over
&gt; the Great Divide.
&gt; 
&gt; Everything on the bus is pretty much stock, and I had the air flow
&gt; meter adjusted, after the engine rebuild, by a knowledgeable
&gt; specialist who used a big expensive exhaust gas analyzer. The smell
&gt; sometimes still occurs near the top of the pass.
&gt; 
&gt; Could it have someting to do with the fuel vapor canister, which is
&gt; hooked up, but has never been replaced?
&gt; 
&gt; It's not a major problem; the bus still runs fine. I just wonder if
&gt; anyone else has experienced this.
