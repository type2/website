Subject: Re: [T2] Shifter adjustment

&gt;I was wondering if the instructions below could be &gt;used for a 76 Westy as well... and if so... should I &gt;just try different positions of the shifter base &gt;until I get it figured out? (since it says the base &gt;moved forward favors 2nd, backwards favors 1st, and &gt;I'm having problems with both...)

I think this is more of a fine tuning adjustment. I've tried this method on my 76, but it doesn't solve 1/3 and 2/4 problems. Check your front shift rod bushing (under bus at front of shift rod). Some would say change your rear shift rod bushings (involves dropping tranny and many say it doesn't work).

Check the squirrel cage thing at the rear end of the shift rod where it connects to the tranny, deteriorates over time. Make sure tranny nose is secure.

Later,

Billy
