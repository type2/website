&gt; On the wrench part: they make metal (aluminum?) oil filter sockets. These
fit on the back of the oil filter and you use a regular ½&quot; ratchet to
unscrew them. Just check your FLAP (around here everyone including Trak Auto
and PepBoys has them). Make sure you get the right size.


My dad taught me an easy trick... use a belt.  Like the kind you put around
your waist.  All you do is put the belt through the buckle and slip it on
the filter.  Then you pull it as if you were tightening it around your
waist.  Has worked every time I have had a stuck filter.
