Subject: [T2]Anybody have tall 40DCNF manifolds?

hi, thanks to all who responded to my other question about the vac
booster.  The other reason for this post is to see if anyone by some odd
chance had a set of type1/tall manifolds for weber 40 dcnfs. I somehow
have the type3 ones.
I will definately trade the type3 and money for the type1 ones.   or any
leads will definately help.  I know that gene berg has them but they are
100$  I was hoping to find a used pair.  Thanks
