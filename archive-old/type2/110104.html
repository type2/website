Subject: Oil pump questions

List,
  I have researched the archives and am now turning to list for suggestions.  
I am putting together a '74 dual carburetted engine with auto-transmission.  
This engine had a problem with HIOP in the past.  It will have a reground 
crank and new bearings etc.  I purchased a new Melling oil pump with 30mm gears.  
Don't know if it is supposed to be high output or stock.
  What do people mean by 'Blueprinting&quot; the oil pump?  Is this something I 
need to do to the new pump?  My old pump had scoring in the chambers and .006&quot; 
clearance on the gears and sidewall, and maybe .002&quot; clearance on the cover 
plate: worn out junk-yes?
   Is it possible to use a Type 1 oil pump?  I read some articles about this 
but it didn't sound like a great idea to me.
   Last question:  My old pump had an &quot;o-ring&quot; to seal the cover plate and 
the new pump has a paper-type gasket.  The paper gasket is the correct seal 
right?
