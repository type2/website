Sam, Jan and list:

CYW just keeps getting bigger and better every show. Almost to the point
of running out of space. There was talk of putting RVs out in the parking lot
since there were so many vendors and cars needing more room.

Great show--starts Friday night and runs thru Sunday to 4 or 5.

&lt;&lt; IS  Circle-Yer-Wagons, Sevierville on both Saturday &amp; Sunday?
 
 Jan &amp; I are taking a trip to Erwin TN from Cupertino Ca, in a rented D***E 
 g_____v_n.
 Still need to pick up some parts and have been to Sevierville the past 2 
 years.
