Greetings all...

I'm getting ready to put an engine into my '69 westy this weekend and have
a few questions.

I read through the Bently manual as well as Muir, but can't quite figure
out which mark I should time my engine to.  The engine that came with the
bus (and is being reinstalled) is marked &quot;F 1198621&quot; and has two marks on
the crank.  None of the illustrations in Muir correspond, bently doesn't
have a &quot;F&quot; engine listed, and when I checked the list of engine numbers in
the back of muir, it appears that this engine is a 1300 from a bug.  That
can't be right can it?

Anybody have a clue which of the two marks I should time it to?  Anybody
have any clue what kind of engine I have?

Somewhat confused...

-James
