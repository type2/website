Subject: Re: [T2] horn and brake lights are linked

Years ago I had a 72 bus that sounded the horn whenever I hit a bump in
the road. It was the source of much amusement for passengers, including
the beautiful lady I eventually married. I tried, but never figured it
out.
Regards,
Chris

&gt; I was not aware until I had to troubleshoot them that
&gt; the horn and the brake lights on the 68-71 series, at least,
&gt; are linked. A while back the horn stopped working. I just
&gt; thought that it had rusted up again. I would get around to
&gt; fixing it eventually. Then, a few days ago, a very angry
&gt; driver informed me that my brake lights did not work.
&gt; I thanked him for letting me know.
&gt;
&gt; To fix the problem, I traced the wiring and found that
&gt; the 12 volts that feeds the brake light switch on the
&gt; master cylinder is the same 12 volts that powers the
&gt; horn. After a few more minutes of poking around, I
&gt; found that the wire had somehow slipped off the fuse
&gt; box. I reconnected it and both the horn and the brake
&gt; lights now work just fine.
&gt;
&gt; Moral: if your horn stops working, your brake lights
&gt; might also be dead and you might make other drivers
&gt; angry. Fix it soon.
