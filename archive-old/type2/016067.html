&lt;&lt;after writing a lengthy post i was amazed at how many of you bus owners
already use synthetic oils.  a preliminary count showed almost 2 out of 3
people who responded to me said they use syn. regularly in their vehicles.!!!!
i will try to post a real count in a few days ( if i remember ).....&gt;&gt;

Well, I used it in my 71, when it pushed the bus around. [Depressed mode off]

What are you supposed to do with the stuff at recycle time??
