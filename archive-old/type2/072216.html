Cc: type2_at_type2_dot_com

The trannies have different &quot;rib&quot; sizes and numbers.  The different years
had different gear ratios.  68-71? have three large ribs, 72-74? have five
smaller ribs that have are cut on a 45 degree angle where the top changes
to the side of the tranny, 75-79 have 5 ribs with no angle cut.


&gt;Is the tranny thats used in the 68-71 bus and the 72-79 the same ? If not,
&gt;how can you tell them apart? I know the later tranny is a two piece. I have
&gt;a friend with a mid 70's bus, so we are wondering if the 68-71 tranny would
&gt;work.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;David
