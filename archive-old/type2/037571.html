Subject: ignition switch info

Hello all,
  I found out some real interesting information today while
trying to find an ignition switch for my 74 bus. 8/71 till
1/74 use the same ignition switch and 2/74 up use a
different one. The early 70's bug is the same as the Bus
and the later Bus use the same switch as the Rabbit,
scirroco, Jetta, and other water pumpers. But I also found
out that the Type 3 use a switch that is simalar to the
71-74 Bus, but is more expensive so Type 3 guys buy the Bus
part and use it. Well I happen to have a complete Type 3
column with switch at home. I spent all day today looking
for a Bus switch and everyone is out, none till next week.
So in goes the Type 3.
  I hope this helps someone other than me.
