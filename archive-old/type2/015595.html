Subject: Re: [T2] New Engine

--=======5A07401C=======

&gt;Hello All,
&gt;I purchased a new engine today, a Brazilian make.  I will be taking it on a
&gt;500 mile adventure this weekend.  Any thoughts on what or an concerns I
&gt;should be aware of for proper break in?

Plan to take the back roads and enjoy the drive at lower speeds. Don't hit
the freeway and drive at a constant speed. Don't pull any long grades.
Shifting up and down through the gears and variation of rpm with light to
moderate loads is what helps break them in. Put a half quart of 2 cycle
motor oil in the full gas tank. Really helps for the rings and cylinders to
lap in. 

If upon start up it seems to be putting out some smoke, drive to the
nearest grade of 5% or so and stop. Now start out in 1st and shift to 2nd
with about 3/4 pedal, put a load on it, a short load, several times. Watch
as the smoke dissappears and the motor instantly gets stronger as the rings
shave off all the little burrs that are the cylinder crosshatch. That's why
you should take this short breakin drive before you hit the road. Change
the oil and make the final tuning adjustments before you go. 

At moderate driving the motor will run warm the first few miles. If it ever
seems to be too hot, let it cool before continuing. Monitor the oil level
and use closly till you know what it's doing.

Have fun.
