Subject: &amp;*$%*_at_ California Emissions...

1977 Stock 2L, AFC FI, EGR filter recently added.

So I took my bus into the test station today to get it smogged, and the
guy informed me that my EGR system is not working right, and he would not
test it. (I know that it will pass the sniffer, as I just had the CO
adjusted.)

He held his hand on the EGR recirculation pipe in the engine bay, and said
that it was not hot enough, so the EGR system must not be operating
properly. I pointed out that if I disconeccted the link to the throttle,
and pushed the valve all the way to the full throttle position, the engine
speed would rise indicating that the exhaust gas is no longer being
recirculated. (However moving the lever on the EGR valve all the way to
the left does not cause the engine speed to rise as expected, which
indicates that _something_ is wrong with it.)

He would not test it, and said I have to have it fixed first. I am
thinking about taking it somewhere else, as my feeling is that he just
didn't want to test it today as it was close to closing time. However I
would like to have it working right if possible.

I know that the EGR valve is NLA, however I am wondering what I should do.
Is there any way to service the EGR valve? If it is working right does
that pipe get really hot like he indicated. Should I try replacing it
with one from a junk yard?

Any advice would be much appreciated.

-Nick
