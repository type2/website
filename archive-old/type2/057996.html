Subject: '66 VW for Auction in Lebanon TN this Friday

I tracked down the 'auctioneer' on the 

1966 VOLKSWAGEN, Pk, VIN# 266137082, belonging to Robert E.
  Bruner, Jr.; to be sold at auction at 2:00 PM, Sept. 4, 1998, 2960
  Canoe Branch Rd, Lebanon, TN. WH32

Seems Mr Duty at 615 443 8588 (1920 Canoe Branch Rd, Lebanon TN) was
rebuilding it for Mr Bruner, and Mr Bruner cannot come up with the
money.

Mr Duty says he has $6,120 in it, and he will not let it go for anything
less.  If he cannot get that, he will finish it off and sell it for $10K
in the West Coast.

Mr Duty say everything done except final paint, transmission, and
install of new WCM rubber kit.

Has new brakes from master cylinder to wheel cylinders redone, Berg 1650
dual carbs, 'deloro' carbs, new hubcaps and wheels.

Barry Burneskis sends his best wishes to all you dreamers out there
    '78 Westy    Springfield VA
