&gt; As most of you know, I am planning on travelling cross country in my 70
&gt; Westy. I was wondering if anyone knew of a way to mount a motocycle to the
&gt; front or rear of my bus. I appreciate any and all replies :)
&gt; thank you

Look for the tire hanger mounts that bolt to the bumper.  They consist of a
bracket that mounts to the bumper and an oval welded to the bracket.  Once the
mounts are fastened to the bumper, you lift up one side of the motor cycle at
a time and set it into the oval.  You may need to unbolt the handle bars to
keep them from going through the rear window.  Strap the wheels to the mounts
and strap the motor cycle to the bus.  Put some rubber or foam between the
motor cycle and the bus [keeps the bus from hurting the motorcycle ;-) ]
