Subject: Campus Vans

I usually spend some of my lunch hour walking around campus (see
signature). With fall term just starting, the parking lots are full,
so I used them to practice my baywindow van spotting, using the
'Field Guide' Bren Smith posted on the 13th.

I wanted to see how well I could identify the year of the van and
how many vans had extra instrumentation added. (While reading this
list the past year, I've added tachometer, voltmeter, and oil temp
gauges.)

I found the earlier years easier to spot. I'd always check my guess
against the front windshield VIN.

In the few days I was looking, I would guess there were about 30-35
baywindow vans on campus each day. This is with a student population
of about 15,000 and fac/staff at about 2,500. (Rough guesses for all
pops.) I don't know how many parking spots on campus, but this won't
stop my guessing about 4-5,000.

Years ranged from '70 to '79. Didn't keep a precise tally, but I
would guess a normal bell curve; ie. most vans in mid seventies.
Only one each for years '71 and '79. Quite a few mid '70s vans.

Perhaps a third were Westies. A lot of them need new seals on
the poptop. The sink seems to be a good place to collect trash.
Saw one Hanover Manufacturing camper, which I think is a '70 (VIN
obscured).

All the baywindow vans were in general parking spots; none in
reserved parking. I guess students drive most of these vans.
Fac/staff usually get the more expensive reserved parking so they
can find a place in the crowded lots. (I'm staff, but I ride my bike
to work.)

There were no split windows vans. Perhaps their rarity and age mean
they aren't available as daily drivers. I didn't keep a tally of
vanagons. Didn't notice any eurovans, but I wasn't looking for them.

Most vans did not have extra instruments. If one was added, it
was usally an oil gauge of some type, and was stuck in the blank pod
where the clock would go. A few had tachs; one mounted on top of dash,
one sitting loose in clock pod. Only one had a VDO tach mounted in clock
pod so it looked like it belonged. (This is how I've done mine, using
the adapter ring available from RMMW.)

The clock pod was a good place to mount personal talismans: stickers,
pictures, mirrors, etc. The most memorable one was a mussle shell within
a larger shell. The mussel shell held some pretty beads. Must be a biology
student.

Most memorable bumper sticker: &quot;Jesus, Save Me From Your Followers.&quot;

No vanlist stickers seen. There are only three of us in Victoria
reading this list, and I think only seven were on the vanagon list.

It was a great excuse for snooping.

My Westy is a '77; School Bus Yellow with list stickers fore and aft.
