Jeff and Genevieve,

I just rebuilt my T2 Westy, to replace your main and cam bearings you'll
have
to split the case.  I was just there, I decided to go ahead and split the
case after noticing unusual rod bearing wear (suspected the crankshaft was
not true or something).  I took the crankshaft and the rods to the machine
shop to be measured and trued.  The machine shop then got me the correct
size main and rod bearings.  I replaced the cam shaft ($35) after noticing
the cams were not all the same height and looked very worn.  In the end I am
glad I split the case, my valves could have been burned because my cam was
too worn to open them enough.  And now I know what the insides look like!
And that's all there is to it (I hope).

Christopher
1979 Westy w/ 1967 T2 engine
