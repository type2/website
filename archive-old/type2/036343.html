Subject: gas gauge question

Greetings..

I'm trying to do some troubleshooting on my gas gauge on my 71 camper.
Previously, the gauge (front unit that tells me empty or full) had just quit
working.  I am under the understanding that I can test whether the problem
lies in the sending unit or in the gauge itself by trying to ground the
sending wire (coming from the gauge) to see if the gauge jumps.  When this
wire is grounded, the gauge should jump to life and read full, indicating a
problem with the sending unit, correct?  If nothing happens at the gauge
needle when grounded, then the problem isn't with the sending unit but
somewhere else in the line or in the gauge, correct?

I was unable to make the needle jump when I turned the ignition on (not
starting the engine) and hooked an alligator clip to the sending wire and
touched the other end to the ground.

Is this correct procedure for this test?  Can I now assume that the problem
lies either in the electrical line to the gauge (unlikely?) or at the actual
gauge itself?

Any comments would be most appreciated.

Thanks,

Tom
