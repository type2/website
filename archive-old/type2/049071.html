Yes, your local FLAPS!  I forget the exact inch size, but there is one
that is within a couple of thousandths of the &quot;correct&quot; metric vacuum
hose.  It is a lot cheaper than the original stuff, but lacks the
authentic braided cover (it actually has the braid, but the braid is
covered with more rubber).
