Subject: BA6 in Baywindow

Anyone install one of these things in their baywindow?

How did you mount it to the floor? Make your own mounts of some kind?
Where it mounts to the floor, wont whatever you use to mount it stick up 
into the passenger area?

I figure that getting the thing mounted to the floor would be step one, then 
I can figure out how the rest it is supposed to mount up under there. Right 
now I have a big mess of wires and whatnot.

PICTURES would be beyond helpful, and ill post them someplace for others to 
reference in the future as well.

I live in San Francisco currently, and would really like to get this thing 
installed by November, so im starting now. I have no idea what im doing, and 
ANY help would be greatly appreciatted.

No, I dont need it for here, but I will for the drive from here to 
Minneapolis come November, not to mention for driving while I live there 
until I can work enough to get myself a winter beater instead. (or, if its 
ok in the snow, just keep driving it, but im guessing I should get a 
beater.)
