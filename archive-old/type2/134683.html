Subject: [T2] late model bus FI ECU differences

Wondering if the ECU's from late model busses can be interchanged &gt; (i.e.-&gt;
a '78 and '79)?
------------------ Clip --------------------------
I'm not sure which years represent changes from the five pin AFM and the
seven pin AFM but in my experience you can change the AFM and ECU with the
proper wireloom and not have significant problems.
The seven pin AFM is the later version and if you take the 25 PIN connector
out for an inspection you'll find the wireloom for the five pin system has
some blank pins that connect to thev ECU.
In summation, try to match the AFM to the ECU and you should be OK.
