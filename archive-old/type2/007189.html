Subject: windshield replacement

Hello guys it's the first time I post on this list, so excuse me if the
question I ask has been discussed recently.
A very good buddy of me has a 79 bus that has traveled with him a round
trip from NY, NM. Fl every year and recently he got a ticket for a
cracked windshield.

I know how to replace the windshield.  I have done that job many times
on my bug. The real problem lays on the rusty surface at the bottom part
of the frame.
He use fiber glass to fix the rust holes on that area an liberal amounts
of silicone between the seal and glass to prevent water leaks.

TO fix the windshield frame will take lots of $$$, time and skills since
there is probably no metal to support the glass.
SO I was thinking if the nose panel that california imports sells (the
one with the windshield frame) is a smart option.

If any of you has done this job and want to drop a line of technical
support will be greatly appreciated !!
