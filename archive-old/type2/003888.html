I had the same problem this summer. What would make a pilot bearing fail so
completely? My tranny shaft had only the slightest wobble. I paranoid it 's
grinding down again.

&gt; Hey all...
&gt;           Well, it turns out there was no pilot bearing, just the remains
of
&gt; one...it took hammer and chisel, a hacksaw blade, and a propane torch to
get
&gt; that old race out of there...*phew*...(note to self...replace pilot
bearing
&gt; before it fails completely...)
