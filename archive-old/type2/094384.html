Subject: Starter problem

Great and powerful list,

My starter likes to stop working after it gets hot on long highway runs.
This does not happen all the time, only intermediately. I have in the past
jumped the starter with a piece of wire under the bus and then it started
fine. I am wondering if the starter has a bad spot on the winding and I'm
just getting lucky that it only finds this spot on trips or if some thing is
getting hot (starter or selinoid) and causing this. I am leaning towards the
heat for I have let it sit overnight after getting home with it not starting
and then in the morning it starts fine. Does this sound familiar to anyone?
Any advice would be great...Thanks...Dana
