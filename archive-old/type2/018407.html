Subject: '71: Intermittant Engine Stoppage
Message-ID: &lt;375D4E1C.716E0D87_at_jhunix.hcf.jhu_dot_edu&gt;

Last Thursday, bus ('71 with poorly balanced GEX single port), freshly
tuned (set valves, new points &amp; condensor, set timing) stops running
after about 1/2 hour or so of hot weather driving with a canoe on top,
gradually gaining elevation.  Caughing like it's out of gas, but there's
fuel in the float bowl immediatly after it dies.  So that rules out fuel
problems, yes?  Also, there's some backfiring as it dies -- electrical
problem, then, yes?  After 20 minute wait or so, it starts up and runs
well again until maybe about another half hour goes by, and I begin to
feel that stumbling again, then it dies withing about a minute.
Repeat.  Dipstick is relatively cool to the touch -- no need to grip it
lightly and pass it back and for the between left and right hands, a la
Muir.  The spark looks ok to me, yellow, and strong, but I think I
checked this only after it was running again, not when it would turn
over but not run.  (BTW, is there a good &amp; easy way to bench test a
coil?  Bentley says at least 9.6v across term. 1 and 15, is that when
running?  on the bench the coils in my box o' coils give me 12v.  Seems
like the auto parts places should be able to test them, but none of the
ones I called near me can.)  Could my new condensor be bad, and if so,
is there a way to bench test these?  How about my ignition wiring, would
that get hot or build up resistance after driving for half an hour or so
and then fail?  I haven't touched it since Thursday, and would like to
figure out a way to fix it and know it's fixed without having to drive
it hard for half an hour to find out.

After three breakdowns, abandoned my vacation plans and headed home,
breaking down once more on the way, driving slower.  Rented a car and
headed out the next day.  Sad to be driving a rental car since no one
waved back on my 4-day trip down to Atlanta and back -- not even the
green split window camper that pulled up right beside me, and really
should have recognized the upside down bus roof rack strapped to the top
of the rental, on its way to its new owner in NC.
