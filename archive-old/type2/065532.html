hey now,

well, back before i had done it twice with folks looking over my shoulder.
since i did by myself, i was bored one day and did the '77s valves again
AND the '74 again. hehehehe i was REAL bored.

and if i'm not mistaken, by doing your own valves you can get a better feel
on how your engine is doing. i'm not sure how you could get a view like this
with hydraulic lifters.
