Johcla wanted me to forward this to the &quot;list&quot; so here it is.

&gt; &gt;Do you have the engine compartment to engine seal installed?  And is it in
&gt;  &gt;good shape?
&gt;  
&gt;  I noticed while chaniging the oil yesterday that the new rubber seal 
between 
&gt; 
&gt;  the apron and the rear tin is actually two flaps but the mechanic laid the 
&gt;  seal on top of the engine tine.  Is it supposed to sandwich the tin to 
make 
&gt;  a good seal?  I can easily unbolt the apron, slide it out an inch and 
&gt;  persuade it back.
&gt;  
&gt;  After the oil change I notice that in town temps stay right at 210 but if 
I 
&gt;  try to drive 60 (it has been windy here) to keep from getting mowed down 
by 
&gt;  the 75-80 mph traffic it still creeps over 250 after a while.
&gt;  
&gt;  Someone said last Friday that 3800 rpm is where cooling is optimized and 
&gt;  that in his bus (71 maybe?) that was 65mph in 4th gear.  Well I can't seem 
&gt;  to get it there without it &quot;feeling&quot; too fast (engine speed and exhaust 
&gt;  note).  I know, real technical, &quot;seat of my pants&quot; explanation here, 
sorry.  
&gt; 
&gt;  It has the power to go faster, and on the flats I can push it to 70, but 
it 
&gt;  just seems to not want to go more that 60 comfortably and I don't want to 
&gt;  push it in the first few thousand miles anyway.
&gt;  
&gt;  So, am I lugging it and should I be driving it faster than 60 in 4th to 
&gt;  acheive prpoer cooling?
&gt;  
&gt;  Thanks,
&gt;
