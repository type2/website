&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;  Metric IS standard. How much more standard can you get?
&gt;
&gt;It is standard, but in backwards countries like the youess the
&gt;inch-measure sockets are a _lot_ cheaper! 

You can get cheap metric tools no less than you can get cheap English
tools. If your into cheap, you can get anything. Consume cheap products.

&gt;&gt;  ..and this from a maths teacher. Words fail me.
&gt;
&gt;Shouldn't a mathmatics teacher be expected in work in _any_ units with
&gt;equal ease?  How about those .0000023-fortnight sockets? :)

Words don't fail me. Cheese and rice, and I gave the formula that he/she
should have had no problem recalling from memory, much less looking up. It
disturbs me greatly that a math teacher cannot convert the two most common
current standards of measure in the world. That really is lame. This rates
an F in a sixth grade class, in my mind.
