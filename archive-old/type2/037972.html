It's called a chassis punch.  They work well on thin sheet metal, but I
don't know what the maximum thickness is.  They are pretty expensive as I
recall.  They used to be used a lot for punching holes in electronic
chassis for tubes and other components.

Check suppliers of electronic tools to see if they still carry them.
