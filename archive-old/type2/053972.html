Ok, straight from Muir.

The number one cylinder is towards the front of the car on the passenger
side.  Number two is towards the back of the car on the passenger side.
Number three is towards the front of the car on the driver's side.  And
number four is toward the rear of the car on the driver's side.

If you're looking down into your distributor cap at your rotor: The notch is
where number one fires.  180 degrees is number three.  If you keep going
around 90 degrees clockwise from number three you get to number 2.  And 180
degrees from number to is number 4's firing position.

Hope this helps,
