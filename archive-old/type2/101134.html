Subject: Re: [T2] 'Tis The Season'--

Eric,

I'm sure you must have tried just about everything in the world including
one of those super strong magnets to fish around in the opening.

Reminds me of when my 2 year old apparently swallowed a small sea 
shell....we found it on the changing table *after* my wife took the boy
to the e/r for an xray.

Just a thought......as I would hate for you to tear it down and still
not find it.  :((  But not near as bad as having your cam gears find 
it&lt;sigh&gt;.

Cheers, dave

&gt; I'm showing my love for my bus by pulling the engine due to a slight dizzy
&gt; mishap (Dad dropped the dizzy shaft spring into the engine block).
&gt; 
&gt; Christmas Eve - dropping the engine
&gt; Christmas Day - tearing it down
