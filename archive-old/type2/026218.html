	Also, most other stock 70's I have seen have
	only a vacuum advance. Can I even use this advance/retard dizzy?
Should I
	only use the advance side and not hook up the retard? Any tips on
where to
	hook up the vacuum lines on the carb/manifold and what to time it
at? All
	these dizzy questions this early in the morning are starting to make
me
	dizzy. Oh well, thanks for any info the wise list can supply.

[...] I think that dizzy is for dual port engines with a PICT 34 carb so
depending on your setup you may not get the results you want.  One side goes
to the carb and the other side goes to some sort of a valve thingy mounted
to the body inside the left edge of the engine door.  Then another hose goes
from the thingy to a nipple on the intake manifold.
