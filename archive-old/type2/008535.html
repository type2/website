Hi George and all.
This isssue comes up now and again, for both the starter and the 
generator. There are several factors to choosing new, rebuilt, or OEM 
rebuilt.

The first thing you need to know is that many FLAPS carry parts that are 
rebuilt. These usually are guaranteed forever. This is good. The bad is 
that most rebuilt electrical parts like these are actually put together 
by students in electrical classes, or cheap foriegn labor. In the 
students case, they get experience and in both cases labor is cheap. 
This often results in poor quality control.
In the case of OEM rebuilt, quality control is high, but the price to 
you goes up.
In the case of new, often this actually is still a rebuild, just a OEM 
rebuil labeled as a new part, and they rightfully can call the part that 
because most of the insides are replaced anyway.

What to choose? In the case of the rebuild cheapies, they are guaranted 
forever so if you are willing to occasionally get a bad part go for it. 
They usually work, but if they dont it usually shows up right away. I 
have had 3 bad generators in a row right of the shelf once. And one time 
the brushes were of such low quality that they were thicker at one end 
then the other, so they worked for a while and then wouldn't go down any 
further. In the case of a starter, I havent had more then one bad one.
The more expensive variants can still be bought with the forever 
warrantee and will work 99.9% of the time right out of the box and for a 
long time after that.

I personally would settle for cheap, beacause they can always go back. 
And that same lifetime part (and its replacements) have been in 5 busses 
in 7 years. Not bad.


Another option is to have your unit rebuilt locally. There is a small 
shack of a shop in OLY, WA, that deals with nothing but electrical part 
rebuilding. They actually can do more for you then ordering a part. They 
can wind for more current, they can balance the unit, and they can test 
it stringently.

You have many options, which shall you choose?
