Subject: Ignition

I am thinking of going to electronic ingition, mostly for the benefit of
maximum starting voltage at low RPM's.  Have been thru the Archives and it
seems that the 'combination of choice' is the Tiger 581 CDI for the max
voltage and either Pertronix or Compufire if one wants to eliminate points.
Before I make any mistakes, is this correct?  This is a '71 with the 1600 DP
engine.  Thanks in advance for any advice, opinions, hints, etc etc.
