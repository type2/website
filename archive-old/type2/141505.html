Subject: Re: [T2] smaller bumper overriders

From Chris:

Which Bays (68-72) had/have the smaller bumper overriders as opposed to the &quot;full size&quot; (taller) ones?  And,
just in front? or front and back same?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

68-72 are round bumpers.
73-79 are square bumpers.

The bumper overriders were an optional accessory.

None had them as standard equipment.  Front and rear are the same for either style.
