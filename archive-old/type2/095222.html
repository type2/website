Subject: Re: [T2] Calling any electrical wizard Now On Duty!

Please don't confuse me with that OTHER Enron...

	Eron

&gt;
&gt;Enron Crites wins the award.  Again special thanx to my foster parent Bob
&gt;Greenup for encouraging me to look elsewhere.
&gt;
&gt;This list is unbelievable, a man across the United States has helped
&gt;immensely via telephone.
&gt;
&gt;Yes Enron,
&gt;the ground on a housing was bad.  I have a wasted light housing, and it
&gt;causes me trouble.
&gt;
&gt;Not bad though, 3 hours later, I figured it out.
&gt;
&gt;Thanx all!!!!
