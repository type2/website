Subject: LCD TV (flat screen for a bus)

Hello List.
  I was browsing on the web the other day and found a cool LCD TV that
mounts on the ceiling and flips down.  It is made by Audiovox (check out

this site)

I know some of you don't feel a need for a TV but I think they come in
handy on long road trips.  I called a local car audio store and found
out that they sell for right around $1000!  Kind of expensive but maybe
they will come down in a few years. Has anyone came across one that is
more reasonable?    I have been looking for a lcd TV for a while.
because it would be perfect for a bus since they are so thin and would
not take up much space.  Anyone out there have one yet?
