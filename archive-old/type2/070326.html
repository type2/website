Even when you are using an external oilcooler (of which you would only benefit
marginally) you'd need to keep the original cooler in place. Removing it (the non
DH cooler from a non DH fanshroud, the one you'd most likely use for
this application) will disturb the airflow to the #3&amp;4 head, more air will
escape via the cylinder fins, result: head too hot, cylinders too cold, and pressure
loss on the #1&amp;2 side. If you make sure you have all the tinware and engine 
compartment seals in place, that the compression is not too high, that the
ignition timing is not too aggressive and that the mixture is OK,  you won't have
any cooling problems.

As for the EI systems, i have no experience with Pertronix, but i'd like to give it
a try, (btw anyone ever had problems with a Pertronix???) what i like about it
is that i can keep the stock Bosch parts which i consider to be among the very best
in the world. The Pertronix will give the one desirable feature of an electronic
ignition, no point wear and therefore no dwell change, at a reasonable price.
What more do you need? Bosch distributors are found all over the world, as well
as regular coils, perfect. I wonder what would happen if i'd have a fancy CDI
and it refuses duty in the middle of Spain... for people who want the very best
from a point actuated Bosch ignition, use the Bosch points of which the partnumber
ends with 145 (the rest of the number is the same for most Bosch points) These
are optional HD points for a 6-Cyl Mercedes, they fit perfectly in any stock 1600
distributor and 009, the points are nickel plated against corrosion, the lifter
is made of polyimid instead of the standard material (polyester of some sort i believe)
and the spring is of course a little heavier than stock Bosch-VW points because they
were made for a 6-cyl, these are the ultimate points for a VW. This heavier spring is
good for high RPM applications were point float can occur. If you want to see what
point float does, put some VW points in an old 6-cyl Mercedes. Some Porsche points
look the same as VW ones, only mirrored, so they don't fit, the condenser is
0.2 microFarad in all AC VWs except some pre early '60s which use 0.275 microFarad
condensers. The ones you'll most likely see on 1600s and upto Vanagons are the
144 and the 204. Bosch recommends only coppercore plugwires for AC VWs. the
stock Bosch-VW distributor cap is also the best you can get. Bosch has a few numbers
that fit our distributors, make sure you get the one they made for the VW, it has a clear
coat on both the outside and the inside, that the best one, i believe its P# ends with
093. The non limiter rotor is the 015, it has a 5 Ohm resistance, that's what you need 
- -in combination with plugwire, plug and mixture resistance- to get the desired voltage
from the coil, the higher the resistance the higher the coil builds up to overcome it,
to a certain extend of course. Best is to use a RPM limiting rotor, look on old Bosch
rotors for P#s, you can by them limited from 3600 RPM to way over 7000 RPM, but
check you get one with the 5 Ohm resistance, because Bosch also supplies 1 Ohm
ones for other applications. Bosch does make non-copper silicone plugwires, but does 
not recommend them for AC VWs or any other car that didn't come from the factory with
silicone wires.

I can supply most of the above parts if you can't find what you need locally, some parts
may seem expensive compared to the Brasil Bosch parts that are commonly available
through the US VW shops. If you need partnumbers of RPM Limiters, email me privately.
When ordering the above P#s someplace, double check them as i don't have the catalogs
here with me to check them.

Brian.
