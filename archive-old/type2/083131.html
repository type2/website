Subject: different octane- different timing

hello all,

my pops tells me that if want to use a higher octane
feul then you need to re-time your engine accordingly.
as different octanes burn at different speeds. what im
wondering is, does anyone know the different timing
positions for all the different feuls. the only one i
know is (76 Type IV Engine) 7.5 BTDC. which octane
does this refer to? as always any answers, opinions,
or insights will be greatly appreciated!!
