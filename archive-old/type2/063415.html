Subject: Stalling on starting corrected!!!

I fixed my problem with my '77 westy stalling when it was started cold.
It would start right up and then die almost immediately.  I would have to
give it gas to keep it running.  I believe someone mentioned it might be an
air leak.  Well I found a cracked hose, taped it up good with duct tape,
and my problem is solved.  It starts up to a smooth idle everytime.
I believe someone else out there had a similar problem?  If you read
this, check your hoses, that may be your only problem.
