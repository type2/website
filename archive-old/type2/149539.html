Subject: RE: [T2] VWs in CO? (was: Safare for Sale)

&gt;Here's another example, though it's not a bus:
&gt;http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds/detail.php?id=176384
&gt;

Don, the seller is &quot;Al Bugs Me,&quot; a VW shop in Ft. Collins focused primarily 
on bugs. Great shop. Al doesn't care much for busses, though. He has a guy 
that works there that handles all of his bus business, and they sell a lot 
of busses and parts and such. Al's quite the character and tells great 
stories.
