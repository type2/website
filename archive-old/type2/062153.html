I've only used Interlux brand marine paint but I've gotten it from reliable
source that Awlgrip is the best brand...The best finish comes from multiple thin
coats ...sanding out your errors and drips (if any) between coats.   I've seen
these finishes last years and years with little or no oxidation.  In fact the
two part urethanes, don't oxidize at all.   Brushing is fun and gives a real
sense of being in touch with the car.  Like a part of a great massage...John
