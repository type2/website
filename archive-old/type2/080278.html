&gt;  A friend of mine just gave me his 2000cc FI engine from his 78.  He had

&gt; not much though) that it had FI problems that would take at least $300
&gt; to
&gt; fix, probably more, he also thought there was &quot;something with a
&gt; valve&quot; and that it was running on 3 cylinders.  So he talks my friend
&gt; into putting a 1600 type I in his bus for $850 (my friend is a newbie

duh,  300 to fix a 65hp motor and 850 for a ? condition 42hp motor??

AH! the real truth, he didn't have a clue
&gt; 
&gt;  So now I have this engine sitting on my shop floor, which is great,
&gt; because my 1700 porsche motor (PO put it in) in my 79 has a broken crank
&gt; (and no heat.)  After some investigation, it appears that my bus still
&gt; has all of the FI components (ECU, fuel pump &amp; reg, etc...) and if I'm
&gt; missing something, my buddy probably still has it.  Looking at the
&gt; engine, the FI system appears to be intact, so I doubt the mechanic even

well you have two choices, put in the 2l engine and have your buddy really
POed with you when he finds out how he got ripped off.
or
save the engine for when he comes begging to have it back. and fix yours 

&gt; looked at it.  I also noticed that 1 of the plug wires was broken, not

me thinks that may have been the problem

&gt; sure if this happened before or after the engine was removed (my friend
&gt; says he didn't know about it.)  Everything looks stock on this motor, I
&gt; doubt it's ever been rebuilt.

how many verified miles on the engine??
&gt; 
&gt;  My tentative plan is to put new plug wires and possible points &amp; rotor
&gt; button in it and cram it in the bus and see if it works.  Is there any
&gt; FI
&gt; trouble-shootin/investigation I can/need to do before I install the

not much the engine really does need to be running or at least hooked up
to trouble shoot it.

&gt; engine?  Looking at the Bently manual, it appears that 90% of the
&gt; trouble-shooting is electrical so I assume that means it needs to be

the list archives/library has a copy of the Bosch trouble shooting manual
for that system

&gt; installed to do that.  Did I mention that I've never owned an FI engine?

none of us did before we bought our first one

&gt;  Also, if I go bald trying to get the FI to work, will my 2 barrel carb
&gt; and intake from the 1700 (circa 1972-74) work OK on the 2000?  It seems
&gt; that I read somewhere that the valves are different for FI vs carb. Of
&gt; course I don't have lot's of $$ to go through a trial-and-error deal
&gt; with the FI.

you are much more likely to go bald trynig to get that carb to work right
on a fuel injected engine than getting the FI working.

it is not really that hard, but it is DIFFERENT.
