Subject: RE: [T2] Sunroof drain - lessons

Well volks, 

I just gotta say thanks to those who helped me out on this one.  I
learned some things and that is always good.
So in no particular order:

- I learned that the seal is no seal at all.  Just a dust and dirt
barrier to what amounts to an intricate gutter system.  

- There are some very helpful souls on this list.  It's a nice place to
be.  Besides, Type2 email is much better reading than most of my email
which promises better mortgage rates, spyware removal, online
pharamcuticals, and longer private parts.

- Headliners, while being sacrificed to the rain demons, cut easily, but
oh so painfully.  There is no blood, but it feels like I am stabbing my
sister. (No sisters were stabbed in the cleaning of the suroof parts,
but I did drop her on her head once as a baby.)

- There are six short pieces of vinyl tubing that like to hold dirt and
rust.  Mine was 90% dirt, and 10% rust (thankfully).

- The dirt when wet is a really heavy sludgy mix that is highly
resistant to movement.  No coat-hanger end is going to push it around.

- The only way to get the vinyly tubing clean requires it being removed
from the van.  100psi out of the compressor will eventually push the
sludge out of there, but it will leave one's hands very messy.
Following this up with running water will clean out the tubing and leave
it looking like thirty year old vinly tubing - yellow, dingy, etc.
Probably what I will end up looking like in another 30 years.

- Joey has a link on his site to where a guy can pretend paint his rig.
Way cool.  Got my paint scheme in my head out on paper and it looks
pretty good.  Learning doesn't have to be confined to the sun roof you
know.

- Forty or fifty gallons of water can move a lot of crap out of the
whole sun roof area once the drains are working.

- Sunny days are great.


Thanks y'all,
Mike
