There is only one belt connected to the alternator. If you are looking
at the rear of the engine compartment, the alternator is right in front
on the right hand side. Does this mean it is upright?

the upright engine is characterised by having a small pulley that is
connected with a fan belt to a generator (cylindrical shape) mounted
up and toward the passenger from the main pulley.

the &quot;pancake&quot; is easiest to identify by a pulley on which runs an
alternator directly to the right of the pulley. The biggest key is
that this style of engines main pulley is also a fan.
