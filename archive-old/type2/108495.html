Subject: RE: [T2] felt washer?

Um, yup. That's what the Bay Bentley shows too. I'm not sure where I got
that idea.  In fact, I'm not sure if my avp rebuild came with a felt ring; I
sure didn't put one in.  What does it do exactly, and how bad is it to not
have one?

Standing Corrected,

They've been included in any gasket kit I've have for an air-cooled Vanagon
engine.  Since the late bays ran similar TypeIV engines they're bound to
have them.  Illustration 13.7 of the Vanagon Bentley shows the &quot;felt ring.&quot;

&gt; &gt;I learned that I need a felt washer when replacing the pilot bearing ..
&gt; where
&gt; &gt;can one acquire this fine obscure item?  and where does it go?
&gt;
&gt; It depends on the vehicle year. Later bays don't have the felt washer.
