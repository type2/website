&gt;On a day in the low 90's, at 70mph, my head

&gt;my temps read. I'll post my results later.

Slow down or you'll overcook yer eggs!

&gt;Check ALL of your vacuum hoses as in remove them and inspect them.  I
&gt;haven't done all mine yet, but I will remove them and blow through them
&gt;with the other end plugged to see if there is a leak. I just bought a
&gt;vacuum gauge too.

What's the vacuum reading?
