Subject: Various questions (long)

Over the holidays I picked up a 69 Westy for a steal.  It came with a 1600 DP
engine that looks like it's from a later type 1 (a 74 according to another
list member.)  When I picked it up, it had been sitting for about 2 months.
Installing a new battery and a shot of gas in the carb got it running for the
15 mile trip home.

It was idling very high, so when I got home I hooked it to a tach and
it was idling at 2000 RPMs.  I popped the cap off of the dizzy (vac advance)
and set the crank pulley to TDC.  The timing was set way
advanced (I don't have a way to measure exactly how much advance)  so I
turned the dizzy until the rotor pointed to the #1 notch at TDC and
put the cap back on.

This time the engine wouldn't even start (spit,cough, no go.)  Then I
found and plugged various vacuum leaks (including this EGR thingy),
cleaned the carb, set the point gap, and installed a new fuel filter
(PO had the filter between the pump and the carb, I moved it to before the
pump) and swapped the pump with a known good one, oh, and drained the
fuel tank.

After all of this, and with a little inspiration (starting fluid) the
engine fired right up and seemed to idle much better.  After warming
it up, I set the idle per Bentley's instructions (34-PICT-3).  To get it to
idle, I had to back out the idle mixture screw a couple of turns
more than the 2.5 - 3 turns that Bentley says, but when I was done it
was idling nicely at 900 RPMs.

Now the problem is that when I step on the throttle, it spits and
backfires through the carb.  If I slowly get on the throttle, no
backfiring occurs.  It also seems to bog down under load, i.e. not
enough power to get up the slight incline at the end of my driveway.

So now on to the questions (finally):

My father-in-law (a pretty good back yard mechanic) wants me to advance
the timing, but these engines are supposed to be set to TDC right?

Is there an easy method to test the vacuum advance on the dizzy?  I have
another vacuum advance dizzy from a type 4 motor, will that work?  (Sorry,
I don't have the part numbers with me...)

In the archives I've read about many headaches with the 34-pict-3, what's
a good alternative carb?

I wanted to clean the fuel pump, but there seems to be no bolts, screws,
or any other method to pull it apart.  Is there a way to inspect and
clean it?

Thanks,

Rob
