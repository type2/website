Subject: Looking for info on Hoover CD
Date: Thu, 18 Feb 1999 10:01:18 -0600

From a &quot;type2 newbie&quot; whose passion in the past was type 1's. (Still love
'em),
In the past, I can remember being able to download &quot;The Sermons of Bob
Hoover&quot; from a type1 list and gaining accurate, easy to understand
information that this 60 year old retired (from income-producing work) VW
lover used many times to save money, time and frustration. I am, by no
means, a mechanic.
I see sporadic reference to a CD of Bob Hoover's sermons and if available,
want to purchase it.
Can anyone tell me more and where I can purchase it?
TIA
Bill
