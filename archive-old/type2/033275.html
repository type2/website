Subject: Re: what defines bus sag?

&gt;
&gt;I did some research this morning. The 63-67 Bentley shows three different
&gt;types of torsion bars, a standard, one softer bar for Ambulance use and
&gt;another type for Fire Trucks. The 68-79 manual mentions no alturnatives.

According to legend, there are actually two torsion bars for 68-79... ones
w/ red paint on em for normal kombis, sedans, etc; one with brown or green
(forget) to signify beefier camper torsies. Or were the colors reversed?
Anyways, as every bus I have ever stripped was a hard-top camper or a
sedan, all I've ever seen are the red ones.

The local salvage yard sells the others when they have them, but at $80_at_
I'll just sag a little.
