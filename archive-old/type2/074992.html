Subject: 2.0L FI Converted to Carb

Hi All:

I am new to the list.  I am in the process of buying a '76 Westy.  One of 
the POs removed the stock FI system and replaced it with a (Weber ?) Carb 
set-up.

Anybody ever heard of this being done before?  Any ideas why this convertion 
would be done?

How difficult (and expensive) would it be to convert back to FI?

Would it be worth the trouble?

Thanks.

Mike
Kansas, USA
