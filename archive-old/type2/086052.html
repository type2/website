Subject: Re: [T2] wiring terminals - adding a wire

 
--Here's my summary (so far) of splicing procedures...


1. twist pair to be spliced together.
2. solder connection.
3. apply wire nut.
4. apply shrink wrap tubing.
5. apply electrical tape (wrap twice in different directions).
6. paint with &quot;star brite&quot; (2 coats).
7. mechanically mount connection to chassis with self tapping screws.
8. reconnect ground strap.
9. encase bus in concrete.


If you can't appreciate the humor, review back episodes of &quot;the anal retentive chef&quot;...

&gt;&gt;To do it right, get a good soldering gun and Kester rosin-core solder.
&gt;&gt;Strip the insulation from the wire for 3/4 inch, wrap the other wire
&gt;&gt;around it and solder the connection.  Use heat-shrink tubing if you can or
&gt;&gt;carefully tape the connection, remembering to allow the tape to take the
&gt;&gt;mechanical strain on the connection, not the solder!
&gt;========================&gt;
&gt;After taping or heat shrink wrapping, paint with &quot;Star Brite&quot; liquid 
&gt;electrical tape.
&gt;Use 2 coats just as you would for a proper paint job to anything else.
&gt;For many applications just the liquid electrical tape will suffice to seal 
&gt;and protect a safe connection.
