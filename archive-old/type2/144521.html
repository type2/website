Subject: WTB: complete set vacuum hoses for 78 2.0FI

Does anyone offer a complete set of vacuum hoses for VW engines?B  It's time
to replace all of the non-fuel hoses and it sure would be nice to buy a
complete kit rather than guess at lengths and ID/OD for each of the hoses.B 
Suggestions...

 Thanks...

 Alabama Pete in Colorado

 PS... Is it just me, or are the archives gettting harder to search for
specific info?
