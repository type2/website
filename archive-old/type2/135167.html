Subject: Re: [T2] Anonymous threatening letters left on my bus...

The first thing I would do is talk to some of your neighbors who are friends
of yours. they may have heard from others who don't want to confront you
directly and might have a better idea how many folks are unhappy with you
and your bus.

 

I would also, as others have noted, really find out what the laws are.

 

I would, as others have noted, report this to the police so that they are
aware of the 'threats'.

 

The key here, IMO, is that you have to live with these people and, while not
betraying your own needs, try to work with them to keep the majority happy -
it is often difficult to keep everyone happy.

 

Just as reference, I live in a suburban area and our town ordinance states
that any vehicle that is not registered must be kept inside.  I've had more
than one offending vehicle parked outside - but have always tried to keep
them out of sight (not always possible).  I have put in an effort to keep my
neighbors on my side and keep the property presentable. this has kept
everyone happy (as far as I can tell :-).  I realize that you live in a city
and don't have property to 'hide' your bus - my point is to look at it from
their view and try to find a workable solution.

 

Good luck,

 

Wayne
