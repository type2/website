Subject: RE: [T2] Bumper question

Brad,

Thanks for the info...sounds like $300 each is about the going rate.

Man, I sure would be madder than a wet hen if someone in a humongo SUV
used my bumpers to park by feel though.

Hmmmm maybe one of those super spark things to zap their engine computer 
if they hit to hard....LOL...

Got any pics of your bus?

Cheers, dave

&gt; I had the bumpers from my CE restored last year.  By restored, I mean they 
&gt; look better than new now.
&gt; 
&gt; They removed the big bend/crunches in the rear one, plug welded a couple of 
&gt; thin spots, painted the inside, and rechromed the outsides.  I was amazed 
&gt; at the quality and straightness of them as I was sure they would reject the 
&gt; rear one as &quot;Unrepairable&quot;. The chrome looks &quot;deep&quot;, much more sheen than 
&gt; new, I believe.
&gt; 
&gt; I paid $550 for the pair. They quoted this sight unseen based on the year 
&gt; and model, so I believe it is a flat rate for these and not per hour.
&gt; 
&gt; I dropped them off locally (Madison, wi) and they were shipped from there 
&gt; to Minneapolis.  Took 5 weeks.
