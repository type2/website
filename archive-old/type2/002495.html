My '78 doesn't have a TDC mark on the pulley. Haynes explains that later
Busses had a TDC marker on the flywheel- and I should &quot;take my Bus to the
agent....&quot; So for the last year I've just timed it &quot;by ear&quot;.  When I pulled
my engine last week, I finally was able to visually find TDC on #1 and mark
the pulley.  My dwell is around 45degrees. My RPM is at 900-50. I bought a
black plastic pulley/timing gauge from RMMW since mine didn't have one.

My confusion is that the only way I can make the Bus run smoothly is to have
the timing set around 16 -20 degrees BTDC! and when I rev the engine it'll
go as high as 40 degrees BTDC. According to Haynes I should be at 71/2
degrees. It'll will barely idle at 71/2.

I've been running it at 16-20 BTDC for a year and it's been running great.
I'd just like to know what's up?

I have a Weber DFEV progressive instead of F.I.
The distributor has to #s, top 0231 168 005 and bottom 021 905 205 P also

Any help appreciated.
