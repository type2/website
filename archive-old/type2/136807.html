Subject: RE: [T2] 'Remanufactured by Bosch' Alternator

&gt; I know that it is probably cheesy to inquire, but with only a
&gt; 1 year waranty, why should one spend $100 or more for a
&gt;  Bosch rebuilt when thay can get a rebuilt alt from Advance
&gt;  for $58 with a 1 year warranty?


FWIW when I worked at Advance Auto the store brand batteries were all the same. The difference was the color of the sticker and the terminology. Economy, Silver, Gold. All the same battery. The difference was the length of warranty and the price tag. Since I have never had any of my purchases fail within 6 months after purchase - that is they are either defective right out of the box or 5 years (out of warranty) down the road - paying for a better warranty has never paid off. FWIW I just bought another Advance Auto battery for my CR-V. Another AA battery, 1st for this car. OEM battery lasted 6 years. O&quot;Reilly didn't keep that size in stock(???)... Very typical size for Asian cars. Dumb. 

When I see the new car warranties for 100K miles I have to giggle b/c so far - FOR ME - I have never had any problems with a car under 125K miles or over 36K miles that wasn't normal wear items. MY Honda (only new car I have or will buy) required 1 alignment (factory did it wrong) and 1 rear hatch strut (leaked). Replaced in the 1st 6 months.
