Subject: Re: [T2] speedo adjustment? 


&gt;  I think to correct a speedometer accuracy problem,
&gt; you have to adjust the preload on the speedometer return spring.  To do this
&gt; correctly would require some sort of test setup where you can get known
&gt; speeds from an input drive while you adjust until you get it right.  I
&gt; suppose you could also adjust, put it in the Bus and drive to see how you
&gt; did, then take it out and adjust again and so on until you get it right but
&gt; that's not worth the hassle for me :-)

Whoa!!!   Do not use the hairspring to try to make any type of 'calibration
adjustment'. You only set the needle on at the correct position once to set the
preload of the spring. Look at the face of any VDO speedo. At about -20 mph you
will see a short white line [at the bottom of the face, to the right of the 10
mph pin]. It will be visable just to the left of the V in VDO. That is the
calibration point of the needle. When you put the needle back on the shaft, it
must point to that line. Then you push the needle on the shaft. Move the needle
to the pin and gently lift it over the pin. That's all you do to set the preload
on the spring.
