Subject: front page news, Beaver Creek Bob

Here’s a story I found interesting, in the Register Guard (Eugene, OR), 
October 1, 1996.  On the front page, just above a picture of a VW 
wrecking yard.

He salvages cars and saves souls. Old Vws: Beaver Creek Bob, a 
born-again Christian, is a mechanic who specializes in VWs.

By Larry Bacon

BEAVER--You can’t miss Beaver Creek Bob’s.

Not that it’s hard to miss anyplace in Beaver, a tiny coastal community 
15 miles south of Tillamook. But Bob’s place stands out.

On the east side of Hwy 101 just across the road from Beaver Creek is 
what looks to be the Lost Graveyard of Old Volkswagens.  Bumper to 
bupmer, door to door, they fill up nearly every inch around Bob’s big 
shop.

Beetles. Buses. Rabbits. Squarebacks. 412s. Baja bugs. Once-elegent 
Karmen Ghias. Some of the cars are whole, and some even run. Others are 
in transition -- a pile of parts waiting for a car or a car waiting for 
parts. Some have been waiting so long that backberry bushes are growing 
around them.

How many cars does he have? Even Beaver Creek Bob doesn’t know.

“I’m not sure,” says Bob, 46. “Something in excess of 50.”

Bob’s ragtag fleet is impressive, a roadside anomaly among Tillamook 
County’s pastures, cows and barns. To VW people, it’s a kind of shrine, 
a place to stop and contemplate the roots of fahrvergnugen.

And for Bob -- who has seen a few hard miles himself -- fixing VWs 
provides a job and a chance to work on something else: souls.  Once into 
drugs and alcohol, Bob is now a born-again Christian.

Bob, ada Bob Wilkinson, grew up in Hebo 3 1/2 miles south of Beaver. He 
graduated from Nestucca High School and stayed in Tillamook county to 
make his living.

He likes old VWs because they were built to last and have had few 
changes over the years, making most parts interchangeable no matter when 
the car was made.

He bought his first VW in 1971 and began collecting parts, an inventory 
now stacked on ceiling-high shelves and hanging from the rafters.

A lady from Eugene pulled up next to the mailbox across the road to take 
a picture. She told Bob that she wondered where all the old VW buses 
went to die, and now she knows.

“People walk in here like they are entranced,” Bob says. “There’s 
something about having all this machinery in one place that makes 
people’s imaginations run wild.”

Bob came of age in the 60s and 70s and grew up loving fast cars and 
motorcycles. He tried the hippie thing and got into drugs and booze. He 
tried to make it as a musician but didn’t.

But even when he was doing drugs, eh helped his father run a grocery 
business in nearby Pacific City -- winning junior citizen of the year 
honors there in 1975 and serving as chamber of commerce president for 
seven years. He started tuning up and painting VWs as a sideline in 
1973.

Eventually, Bob gave up alcohol and drugs. When his marriage broke up in 
1991 he made his VW business a full-time occupation. Two years later, eh 
took a new wife, who helped him find Jesus.

Since then, the balding mechanic has trimmed his beard close, giving him 
the appearance of a biblical prophet in coveralls. The VW business has 
taken off, and his life is good -- chugging along like a dependable old 
VW.

“The Lord’s blessing me,” he says. “God has spoken to me, and he has 
also lectured me as a father would a son, and made me change.”

There were days, he confides, when he didn’t like people looking over 
his shoulder when he fixed their car because he didn’t do all that he 
could or should.

“But since I came to Christ, that’s not an issue anymore,” he says. “Now 
I try to fix (every car) just like it was Jesus’ car.” 

Even in Tillamook county -- with the closest VW dealer in Salem -- there 
are plenty of VWs to fix. They belong to old hippies, surfers, 
off-roaders and just ordinary people who regard VWs as reliable 
transportation. Even teen-agers like them.

“The Volkswagen bug is today’s street rod,” Bob says. “One out of every 
five kids in high school has a flaming desire to own a cool bug.”

Bob fixes VWs and sells parts to locals as well as to the tourists who 
pour down Hwy 101 every summer. He doesn’t need to advertise.

He likes to be paid for his work but sometimes does without. when people 
dressed in tie-dye show up looking for a miracle to keep their VWs 
running, Bob sees a little of himself in them and does what he can.

Like the kids from Iowa traveling in a 1970 VW bus with a balky starter. 
Bob says the Holy Spirit was leading him when he crawled underneath and 
tightened a loose bold, fixing the starter.

They said thanks, and that’s when he asked them about their relationship 
with Jesus.

“I figured this is what they’re going to pay me,” he says. “They’re 
going to have to stand here and listen to me talk about Christ.”

He’ll bring up the subject of Christ to just about anyone who comes on 
the property. But get him going about VWs, and he’ll tell you how to 
save your car as well as your sould.

Like shifting on hills. The traditionally underpowered air-cooled VWs 
heat up and risk stuck valves and engine meltdown going up hills in high 
bgears. So do your car a favor and shift down, he syas, especialy on a 
hot day.

He gets a little preachy, even about VWs. He doesn’t like Baja bugs -- 
the Beetles with the scoop nose cut off and the back end cut away so the 
engine hangs out.

“It’s sacrilegious,” he syas.

People who love their classic Beetles take care of them, he says, but 
Baja bug people usually take them off-road and beat them up. “I seldom 
see people keep Bajas for a long time before they destroy them,” he 
says.

Bob even has advice for getting the most from a VW heater, which many 
people believe work only on hot days. Try turning the motor up higher, 
he says, because that will pump more warm air into the car.

“Instead of driving around in 4th gear on flat ground at 40 mph, shift 
into 3rd gear and drive 40,” he says. “It doesn’t hurt the motor, and 
you’re warmer.”

VW quit selling buses and bugs in the US in 1979, but Bob thinks they’ll 
keep rolling on for decades -- largely because they’re so dependable and 
because many companies make cheap parts for them. 

And Bob will do his best to keep the VWs of Tillamook County running. At 
least for awhile. He’s thinking of getting out of the VW business 
someday and using his piano-playing skills in a music ministry.

Until that happens, he plans to change his Bever Cerek Bob image by 
sprucing things up a little.

“Eventually, you’ll se a nice clean building,” he syas. “A parking lot 
out in front. A Cyclone fence. That’s what I think I should do just to 
project that I am a Christian.”

But somehow, Bob, it just won’t be the same.

Well, you read it here first. VW stopped importing buses into the US in 
1979 (hmmm....) and Jesus drives a VW.
