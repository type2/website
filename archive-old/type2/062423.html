Subject: Heater Cables...'77

Okay experts, here's the problem.  Ordered and got new heater cables for
Bleu the blue '77 Riviera.  Was replacing the old ones 'cause they didn't
seem to fit too well.  So, we install them and the left one (FIF) is about
2&quot; too long and the right one is about the same distance too short.  I have
refered to RMMW's cataloge and the lengths are correct per the listing in
the cataloge.  The other  listings would appear to be incorrect also.
Anyone have any ideas??  Anyone ever shortened one of these cables
sucessfully??  Couuld I have a problem w/ the heater boxes??
