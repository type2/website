                   That's one thing I thought of doing.  recitculating the
air.  Since I have no heater boxes use air from inside the bus to blow
through where the air from the heater boxes go.

You'll find the gas milage is better if you use the gas heater as auxilliary 
to the stock heat.   I did at least.   Any reason you can't put heater boxes 
on the motor?
