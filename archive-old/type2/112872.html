Subject: Aux Battery size

Hello, I purchased an '82 Westfalia a month ago, and it came without an
auxilliary battery so I plan on putting one in.  I have the Hella kit
from Busdepot that was recently discussed, but no battery as of yet.

I looked in the archive but could not find the answer to this one (I am
sure it has been discussed, I apologize).

What size of auxilliary battery is available in a deep cycle that will
fit in the space? everything I have seen in the FLAPS are overheight (7&quot;
+) for the space.

Thanks,

GG
