Tony's kidding around, folks. He knows a lot about British cars, and 
knows that the AC Cobra started out as the AC Ace, a little British 
sports car that was powered by a Bristol engine before Shelby started 
goofin' with it.

But maybe a closer analogy is putting a Honda engine in a Porsche 911?

Anyway, I think a VW bus ought to run, sound, and feel like a VW bus. 
People who want something that doesn't run, sound, and feel like a VW 
bus should get something that isn't a VW bus, thus leaving every last 
remaining VW bus intact for people who appreciate what they are.

Don's entitled to do whatever he wants to do. It's his bus. But we 
don't have to like it.
