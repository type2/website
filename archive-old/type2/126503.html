&gt; Perhaps it would be interesting to note what the yellow stuff is?

I'm pretty sure this was covered......

It's water. In a water cooled car, seeing more than traces of this
would be signifigant cause for concern. But since there's no water in
our busses (unless it's a wasserboxer), then it's actually not a big
deal.

It's caused by the oil staying too cool to properly outgas moisture.
It can't boil off. Moisture condenses inside the engine, more in the
cylinders I suspect, and it seeps into the crankcase. When it's
whipped up with oil it turns yellow and foamy.

The only real concern is that it does degrade your oil. So seeing it
means it's time for an oil change. The only way to prevent it is to
take a drive down the highway every day or two. ;-)
