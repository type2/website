Sorry - 10 W 40. In fact, there doesn't seem to be much variation in 
diesel oils that are readily available. I guess what I am really 
wondering is what makes diesel motor oil different from standard oils, 
and do the differnce make it worth considering for air cooled VWs? For 
reference, the best diesel oils here in the UK are about twice the price 
of Morris (which is our standard VW air cooled 30 grade oil).
