Subject: jalousie window handles

I also bought the same round handles, but at my local RV supply store here in 
Michigan.  Apparently they are a common handle, for the many of the &quot;modern&quot; 
RV pop top campers, for their jalouisie windows, too.

I believe they were only 5 bucks at most, and i'd be willing to p/u a few and 
ship em out, for someone if they had a super hard time finding them locally.  
They are nearly identical, same # of grooves, black in color, and are a 
perfect fit. 

Another part I also bought at the same store was a propane regulator, 
&quot;manchester&quot; brand, (oe) for my stock stove setup.  My old one was leaking, 
and although this one looks different, it fits and works fine, _at_ about 25 
bucks.
