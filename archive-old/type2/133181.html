Subject: Re: [T2] VIN swap (was Jay Leno)

Folks,

Everything I have seen on this subject has to do with the &quot;gorillas&quot;...
you know, those cars that drive down the hiway spewing blue/black clouds 
of smoke cause the people that own them just can't afford to get them 
fixed or buy new ones...it has nothing to do with &quot;vintage&quot; cars as these 
are generally ummmm... &quot;well kept&quot;....

Anyone have *any* idea at all how many baywindows are still out there 
running around???

Cheers, dave(who lives in a state where not only are there no emissions 
             tests, but not even any inspections)

&gt; Clearly, they are attempting to get as many old cars off the road as 
&gt; possible. Collectors' cars are a small percentage of these.
