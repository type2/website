Subject: Re: [T2] Vaccum leak near manifold

Steve,

From your pics, it sounds like you might need a new throttle body seal.
Either that, or you have rust through on the plenum.


Part #10 at this site
http://www.bug-bits.freeserve.co_dot_uk/ramva/fiche/t201820.gif

I bought a couple of new ones last year.._dot_can't remember where though.

The other alternative is that you are hearing the air bypass port.  On 
your second picture, the large screw next to the blue arrow.  I 
think that is the one, I haven't had touch mine in a long time.  Remember 
where it is right now and then turn it one way or the other and see if 
your sound changes....be sure and remember to put it back where it was
untill you find out what was really wrong.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; I can hear a leak in the manifold near the air intake, but does not seem to
&gt; be coming from the gasket.  It seem to be coming from the manifold - See
&gt; Picures: http://filebox.vt_dot_edu/users/sselin/pics/vaccum_leak.htm
&gt; 
&gt; I used a tube as a stethescope and am pretty sure that's where I am hearing
&gt; the leak.  Anyone have experience with this.
&gt; 
&gt; The vaccum is only at 8&quot; and there are no other big leaks that are obvious.
&gt; 
&gt; If the leak is on the manifold, can I patch it, or do I need a new part?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Steve
