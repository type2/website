&gt; Question two: Do I really need any special tools to do
&gt; the rear drum brakes, or can I get by without buying
&gt; special tools?

No. Just fiddle with the spring back there using regular pliers.

&gt; Question three: While I am in there, I will be
&gt; replacing all bearings and inspecting races. Is there
&gt; anything else I need to do while I have this all
&gt; apart?

Bearings and races are replaced in pairs. After you remove anything make it
super clear before you install again.

&gt; First, does anyone have a more detailed procedure than
&gt; what is in Muir or Bentley for replacing pads &amp; shoes,
&gt; adjusting rear brakes, and bleeding the whole system?

First do you have new flex hoses? If they are originals and you replace the
front pads and rotors making the clearance tight you may end up with
squealing.

Be careful with hard brake lines. Always use two wrenches when possible.
They are 11mm which you may not have in your tool kit.

* Front

- The front brakes are self-adjusting (if the seals are good)
- Use new hardware (spring separator, backing plates and pins)
- re-orient the caliper pistons to engage the tabs of the backing plates
- piston metal is very porous so be careful not to damage them
- Don't get anything grease, oil, dirt on the rotor. It must be super clean.
- Install new caliper seals if the dust boots are torn
- Don9t lose the speedo c-clip and have some silicon handy to re-secure it
- If the socket head screw holding the rotor on is rusty be careful. Clean
out the head like a cv joint bolt before trying to use do it. If you strip
it, it's M8x20mm.

* Rear

- Follow Dolan's advice for adjustment:

http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/091460.html

- Replace leaky wheel cylinders
- Inspect the condition of both handbrake cables
- Use anti-seize on the adjusting stars (in the barrel and on the threads)
- Replace any missing backing plate plugs

* Bleeding:

- Bleed the lines longest to shortest (R rear, L rear, R front, L front)
- Use the bottom screw bleed screw to bleed until you see new fluid
- Use the top screw to bleed out the air because it rises.
- Use Castrol LMA Dot 4 fluid (or ATE Super Blue for fun)
- I needed 1.5L (48 fl oz.) to flush years of crud out
- Use a funnel when filling the brake fluid so you don't spill it
- Motive Power Bleeder 0104 makes the job a cinch
- Don't strip the bleed screws. Replace any missing caps.

* Bearings:

_ if you hand pack the bearings use the dragging technique:

http://tinyurl_dot_com/dd4m

- Mobil 1 synthetic grease is only $5 a cartridge. Use it.
- Clean all of old grease off the front spindle and grease it good before
reassembly

- Remove any grease &quot;flug&quot; inside the hub if you don't end up replacing the
bearings.

- When you are done the front hub should have no travel. Check this before
you take the hub off for the first time so you can compare.

- When driving races, don't score the hub. Use a Lisle race driver set or
brass drift or work slowly.

- You need sturdy snap ring pliers to remove the inner circlip on the rear
- Use a new cotter pin (N-012-548-1) on the rear.
- You'll find a 3/4&quot; drive 46mm socket online or at vwflaps.
- A 3/4&quot; slider bar from Sears and pipe will get off the rear castle nut and
allow you to torque it back up using your bodyweight. 253 ft. lbs.
