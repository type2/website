Subject: Re: [T2] Buses on very bad roads: fine or foolhardy?

&gt;hello All   Buses can be amazing as to where you can go in them . I have
&gt;driven my old 66 westy on some of the damnest so called roads that you could
&gt;imagine .in all kinds of weather  solid ice is the hardest to go on.They
&gt;always do better with some weight in the back of them. If you ever catch me
&gt;at one of the campouts get me to tell some of the  &quot;Tales of the Ghoost&quot;
&gt;after 32 years I have plently of them. Later and have fun  Mark Dearing

I driven across and through streams, up and down mountains, dirt, gravel, etc.

You can roll one over. They are narrow and tall. I've gotten mine stuck on 
wet grass though.

Take straps, chains, and winches wherever you go.

It can handle it but you'll be replacing suspension parts (bushings, etc) 
every 300K versus every 500K miles!! &lt;grin&gt;
