Subject: How to check Speedometer?

I recently received a ticket from a &quot;local speed trap.&quot; He said 40 I said 30. 
So, I went to the local speedometer test shop and they could not test a VW 
Bus because the cable connects to the front wheel. 

Anyone have an idea on how to calibrate the speedometer. Mine does jerk 
around at speeds below 35 mph, then seems to steady out at higher speeds. In 
the freeway I keep up with the other vehicles without a problem. The 
speedometer is usually around 70 during those times.

Thank-you

Tom
