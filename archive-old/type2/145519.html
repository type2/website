&gt; &gt; I seem to recall that a &quot;square engine&quot; (bore and stroke as close to the
&gt; &gt; same as possible) was desirable for high torque uses in V8's.

&gt; &gt; Hopefully someone will chime in with some real experience for our ACVWs. -)

&gt; It doesn't matter what kind of engine really, aircooled, watercooled, but
&gt; oversquare engines will rev more easily while (closer to) square will make
&gt; power at lower rpm and top out sooner. There is no acvw engine I am aware of
&gt; that is actually square, but you notice as the type 4 bus engines got bigger
&gt; and then morphed into the Vanagon water boxer, they got closer to square,
&gt; and better because of it. Upright bus engines were all closer to square than
&gt; any type 4.

As displacement increases, it is usually easier to make the bore bigger
than it is to increase stroke.  This also keeps the engine package about
the same size.

Subaru boxers tend to have rather short strokes, since they wanted to
increase displacement and still put the engine in the same space.  Nobody
seems to find these engines lacking in torque, though.
