Subject: Valve clearance on rebuilt engine

I bought a 71 single cab a couple of days ago. the PO
said the engine had been rebuilt 'completely' less
than 50 miles ago. the engine looked clean and sounded
good. i drove it home, about 50 miles, and the next
morning i checked the valve clearance. the #1 and #2
cylinders had from 0 to. 003 clearance. i adjusted
them to .006. #3 and #4 had exactly .006 on all
valves. does the tight valves on just one side
indicate a possible problem or just perhaps a sloppy
initial adjustment? I changed the oil after i warmed
it up. the old oil was very black which i thought was
unusual for a hundred miles. any comments.
BTW it ran great on the way home.
