Subject: clutch replacement

hello all,

i am replacing my clutch next saturday. i have ordered
the following,

luk heavy duty clutch kit
flywheel lock
transaxle drain socket 
rear main seal
and
haynes manual

from the bus depot, i also plan to get a new flywheel.
now, can anyone think of anything i am missing. i've
got a 48 hour window to get this job done and i would
hate to find myself unprepared. also, i plan to put
new trans fluid in as long as the tranny is out. how
is this done, and is there a specific brand or type
that i need to buy? thanks in advance.

Matty
