Subject: Re: [T2] the canadian border

I'll put my nickels worth in before George pulls the plug on this thread and
maybe even sneak in some bus stuff.
I'm a dual citizen and often go back and forth to SoCal and Wa. There was a
period when I was going back and forth to Ca several times a month. First
trip, cross at the peace arch in Wa, pull up about 7am with a full load of
tools(headed south to rebuild an engine) theres two people in the both, get
the usual why are you driving a Cdn vehicle on a US passport. Tell them cuz
I live on Van Is. Get the usual why the heck do you live there when you can
live in the US. I'm thinking 'cuz of jerks like you, instead answer with
'family' get the usual where, why, how long, turns to the other person and
says I'm done, how about you. Get told to pull over to be searched. Now mind
you I'm 40ish and driving a poop brown astro, not profile material. 30min
later I'm on my way. Return trip at Cdn border, how long you gone, any
booze,guns or smokes, welcome home.
Next trip, take the Coho ferry instead and use a different crossing, get the
usual where, why, how long plus what do you do for work, Just moved so I'm
between jobs. Again get the why the heck you live there, again told to pull
over and wait for the officer to search. Return trip Cdn side, any
booze,guns or smokes, welcome home. Third time, getting gunshy, again try
Port Angeles, get the usual plus job question (insurance broker) plus this
time what are you bringing into the country, I answer just money cuz I'm
going to look at a car. Pull over and wait for the officer. Mind you, this
was prior to 9/11. Wierd thing is I crossed not long after 9/11 and had no
problem, but by then I was in the habit of handing the officer both US
passport and BC drivers licence. The only problems I've had going north is
bringing vehicles up after 9/11 and it's mostly customs officers who dont
believe the amount on the bill of sale, (wonder why 8-0)
