 time

hee hee.. I just realized too, that in my email post a while back, I
suggested putting the cable in from the other side.. 

That would sure work great if the gas pedal was in the back and the
engine in the front.. DOH!!!

I feel that &quot;clueless&quot; email coming to haunt me.. ahhhhhh

&gt; Hi, Ric--
&gt; 
&gt; Since your cable is already out [it is, right?], I vote for Scott's
&gt; vacuum-and-string idea. It appeals to the McGuyver in me. But if you are
&gt; ever in this situation again, there's a great trick that, unfortunately,
&gt; only works if you do it *while the old cable is still in place.* For what
&gt; it's worth, I'm pretty sure I got this idea from the type2_dot_com
&gt; archives--props to whoever originally posted the idea.
&gt; 
&gt; Get a length air hose from an aquarium supply place, using whatever inside
&gt; diameter will fit snugly over the square drive end of the cable [I forget
&gt; the specs at the moment], and buying enough so that you have a piece about a
&gt; foot or so longer than the replacement cable.
&gt; 
&gt; Slip the tubing over the end of the old cable [I also used some fine wire to
&gt; twist around it to make sure it stayed put], knot the other end so it won't
&gt; pull through, then carefully draw the old cable back out, pulling the tubing
&gt; back through the hole after it until the tubing is sticking out under the
&gt; dash where you can easily reach it. Pull the tubing off the old cable end
&gt; and fasten it to the new cable the same way, lubricate the new cable, then
&gt; slowly and carefully use the tubing to pull the new cable back through.
&gt; 
&gt; Worked like a charm for me.  I know it's not too helpful for you if you've
&gt; already got the old cable out, but hey--in a couple hundred thousand miles
&gt; you might face this problem again, or you might buy another bus, or . . .
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck!
