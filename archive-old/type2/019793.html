Subject: Front Spare Tire Mount

Volks:

I found a front spare mount at a junk yard a few weeks back.  I was
trying to install it, but have no hardware.  It seems I need 1/4&quot; rivets
or sheet metal screw, neither of which can I find.  Any suggestions? 
What did it originally come with.  I looked at some nylon anchors, but I
don't think they would hold a tire.

thanks
