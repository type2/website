        Hmmm, my bad memory, I guess. Thought I recalled David saying
that he'd weighed out at over 5000. At any rate, 4100 is probably a
pretty good norm for people on a journey, although I've loaded mine much
heavier at times. Had my '69 loaded so heavy returning from B.C. to WI
once that my wife couldn't steer it. And there was nothing wrong with
the steering. We had removed the middle seat. Used to haul firewood in
it too, once loaded the entire passenger area with wood up to the window
level, but only once. It was too hard on the clutch, and had very little
braking ability on the downhills.
         At any rate, VW made a very, very, wise move when they switched
to the T4 engine, especially the 2.0L. And an even wiser move when they
went WC.
