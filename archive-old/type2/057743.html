Howdy All.

I've been a lurker for about 6 weeks or so.  Boulder Colorado, 71 Westie
&quot;BAMF&quot; with a turtle top, 1600DP. In the past I have had a 65 hardtop (San
Diego), and a 71 rustie (Minnesota).

Looking for a single or double cab splittie or loaf that is not a million $
(along with half the list).

I am wondering if there is a type 1 list somewheres.  I have a cherry b*g
rack that I want to sell.

You all are a great resource!
