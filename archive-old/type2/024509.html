Went by the  local Kmart the other day and I saw something very interesting.
They were selling a gallon of fuel that could legally (according to the box) be
stored in a car for emergencies.  It was a self contained box with the fuel
inside.  Intrigued I read on.  It burns like gas, but isn't gas.  It says it
isn't even flammable.  It must need compression to burn.  It might be useful for
those who have intermittent gas gauges.  This way if you get stuck empty you
could fill up and go another 20 miles before getting stuck again :)
