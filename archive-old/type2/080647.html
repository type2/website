Hello all, I need a brake fluid reservoir for my 1968 bus.  I am going =
to try to jb weld the old one, since it doesn't need to hold any =
pressure, just fluid.  But would like to replace it with a new one if =
possible.  Looked at Rocky Mt., but couldn't find it there.

Plus, what do I tell the person who is painting my bus &quot;exactly&quot; what =
&quot;titian red&quot; is? =20

Thank you very much,
Jennifer of South Carolina
