Subject: Re: [T2] door seals? pop top latches?

Karen,

I think I bought the real German ones from bus-depot when I restored my 
78.  IIRC the price difference was not that much for something I expected 
to last as many years as the original...and wanted to fit as original.

The fit was terrific, but did require some careful application of 
weather strip glue...Look, really look at how the originals were installed 
before tearing them out....digital pics are a godsend.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi Volks-
&gt; 
&gt; library, but I would like a bit more input if anyone has replaced their 
&gt; front door seals. I want to purchase new door seals and saw a couple of 
&gt; posts in the archives regarding the poor fit of the Brazilian 

&gt; German ones are available at a slightly higher cost.  Has anyone 
&gt; replaced door seals with either the Brazilian or German rubber, or both 
&gt; (!) and which would you recommend?  
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for your time,
