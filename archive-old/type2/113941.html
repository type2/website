I did this.  I did not do a before/after dyno test but I noticed no seat-of-the-pants improvement.

&gt;i tried to look this up, but couldn't
&gt;verify that the euro spec carbs had bigger vents, but all carburation logic
&gt;would say they would have.

The dual Solex 34mm carbs offered by CB Performance supposedly have 28mm venturis.  There's your 2mm.  :)

&gt; when fitting aftermarket carbs on a motor the
&gt;first thing you do is decide what size venturis you will run, and this is
&gt;determined mostly by displacement. two motors with 300cc difference in
&gt;displacement would not likely run the same size vents unless the other
&gt;engine specs were vastly different.

All conventional wisdom that I have come across says that the stock Solex venturis are way too small for even a 1700cc engine, yet VW put them on from the factory.  Because of this, I'm not convinced that larger venturis are necessary for an 11% increase in displacement (from 1800 which came stock with 26mm venturis, to 2000).  I ran the stock 26mm venturis on my 2-liter engine for a few years and they ran just fine.  My current opinion is that the stock cam is the limiting factor in upper-rpm breathing on the type IV, not the carbs.  With an aftermarket cam, I think a case could be made for larger venturis.
