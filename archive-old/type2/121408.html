Subject: Re: [T2] OT: Type2 Gas Mileage - The Environment - BioDiesel

I agree that the best alternative for the environment is to burn no fossil 
fuels.  I ride my bike, take the &quot;El&quot;, or take the commuter rail to work 
(which does require me to drive to the station).  Unfortunately the weather 
here in Chicago does not lend itself to bike commuting 12 months a year.

To comment on the &quot;holisitc&quot; thoughts, I agree it takes tremendous energy 
and resources to build a new car.  And what do you do with it once it is 
past its useful life?  My 1997 Saab 900 was 93% recyclable, if I recall 
correctly.  And I'm not a huge electric car fan, since 24 batteries that 
last 2 years doesn't sound like a great solution.  Last time I checked 
batteries (lead acid, LION, ...) were not exactly friendly to the 
environment.  Not to mention that so much of our electricity is generated 
by burning coal.  The trade-off is tail pipe source pollution for factory 
smoke stack pollution.  That may help reduce smog in LA, but is still sends 
acid rain to Canada.

Finally, diesel engines can run on a variety of fuel sources.  The used 
cooking oil concept is called BioDiesel.  With many engines all you have to 
do is strain it and you are good to go.  The problem is that it congeals at 
a relatively high temperature, between 9 and 12 degrees C.  When diesel 
fuel or biodiesel cools, wax crystals can form in the fuel. The crystals 
can plug fuel filters and stop the flow of fuel to the engine.  So either 
you have to keep the fuel warm, or have an alternative fuel source for when 
the weather is cold.  This would be an issue where I live, it drops below 
52F quite regularly :-)

Here is an interesting link

I know I'm long winded, so I think I'll retire myself from this 
conversation on the list.  I've only had my bus for 1 month, so it's hard 
for me to add much value right now to on topic conversations :-)

&gt;i all the T2's i have owned, they have all gotten around 20 mpg on the

&gt;better milage.
&gt;
&gt;as far as the environmental factors that some folks are discussing - i 
&gt;totally agree with the fact that unless you are carpooling or riding a 
&gt;bike to work everyday then you don't  have enough reason to complain. - 
&gt;how about these new kits for diesel engines that run on used fryer grease? 
&gt;i saw something on TV that was showing some folks who put that kit on 
&gt;their RV &amp; are driving cross-country. they stop at fast food restaurants 
&gt;to refuel.
&gt;
&gt;it doesn't burn fossil fuels &amp; talk about saving some gas money!
&gt;
&gt;i do not know about emissions with this setup.
&gt;
&gt;YMMV,
