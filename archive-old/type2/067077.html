Subject: Re: Bus Restoration &lt;body/paint advice&gt;

&gt;You guys are telling me, that for money, I could have this (rumpled bus)
made to look nice (newish!?)
&gt;How realistic is that?  
&gt;&gt;It can be done. I have seen folks clip on the *whole* front area of a bus
from the middle of the bench area forward with out a trace after painting.
The main key factor is the rarity of the bus, your budget, interest level
and length of time that you allow yourself to complete the project!
&gt;Are we talking about thousands of dollars?
&gt;&gt;Yeah, as an understatement unless you are a welder and a body and paint
glutton. Serioulsy, I have heard of several, several $10,000.00 BODY and
PAINT (only) situations.
&gt;From where I sit, I could get my next bus for less.
&gt;&gt;Probably a good &lt;excellent&gt; decision unless the particular bus is sliced
bread or the vehicle in which dad &quot;courted&quot; mom. ;-)
&gt;OTOH, if I can have this kind of work done and not go broke, and limit my
expectations to what's reasonable, I won't NEED my next bus.
&gt;&gt;Some how the concept of &quot;Flying Monkeys&quot; comes to mind...
&gt;Tell me more!
&gt;&gt;Honestly, after the &quot;Resto from Hell&quot; experience, I would save my money
like a crazy person until I found a rust free bus that hasn't been hammered
and drive the darned thing. Chances are that you would get a bus that was
complete and turn-key for less money and hassles than if you did a &quot;Resto.&quot;
If you desire a merit badge or the knowledge which accompanies stuffing an
elephant through a hula hoop then go for it. For most folks, Id advise that
if you currently love VWs and want to keep it that way I would opt for the
&quot;Done&quot; category.
Otherwise I would take a relaxed approach and *HAVE FUN* working on any
vehicle of your choice at the speed of your choice, to the degree that it
does not shred the family's inter-personal, spiritual, and financial priorities.

Actually there is a great pride in completeing a very nice bus. Just keep it
all in perspective. It's a vehicle, not the end of life as we know it. Thank
goodness that we have the freedom to make the choices! =)
