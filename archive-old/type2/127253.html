It's actually not a bad idea.  Water dissolved in air is called &quot;humidity&quot;
and is experienced every day but buses in humid environments.  You could
put a mist sprayer on the inlet of the fan and lower the air temperature
twenty degrees in desert environment without ever having liquid water
touch the engine.

However, it would use a lot of water, as the fan pulls a lot of air.  A
westy water tank might support such a system for a half-hour or so!
