&gt;Hey folks, am switching up to the 70amp alt. for my ' 78 Westy, and am having

&gt;know where I can lay my hands on one?

The D shaped boot is for the 55 amp alternator (as in I have a 55 amp and 
it is definately D shaped).

If you have an O shaped boot, you probably already have the 70 amp.

Anyone know if the rear covers interchange between the two alternators?  If 
so, you might not need to change boots.
