Subject: Re: [T2] setting timing on '78

Got a 68-79 Bentley? If yes, go to section 5, page 23, figure 8 - 1. The one
pictured is an early metal one. Yours would be black plastic. See also page 21.


&gt; I have a 78 Westy which is new to me and my first type 4 motor, having owned
&gt; a splitty and a '70 Westy.  I checked in the type2 library re: timing and it
&gt; appears I am supposed to have some sort of timing scale which doesn't seem
&gt; to be there on my bus!  I am assuming it fastens somewhere around the outer
&gt; edge of the crank pulley??  Is this scale something I can find/buy on its
&gt; own?  Does someone have a picture of where it goes / how it mounts?
