- CARB -
I almost put on a spare carb I have, but then I thought, if it ain't broke,
don't fix it.  (I should probably apply this same logic to the dizzy.)  The
34 PICT 3 I have in there right now seems to work just fine except I can't
get the idle down to the recommended 900 RPM.  It sits at about 1100 RPM
with
the idle adjustment screw (the larger, upper screw one the side) tightened
all the way in.  The spare carb is a H31 PICT from Brazil.  The REAL dilemma
is this . . .

Chris,don't have our PICT 3 in front of me now. Isn't this the one you have
to get the throttle plate setting correct, before you can get the idle
adjusted w/ the pair of side screws? Tinkering with that first step finally
got ours in the range where I could set it right on.
