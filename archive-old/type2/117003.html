Subject: External Oil Cooler Kits Whose to Use?

I am going to add an external cooler to my 78' type IV motor and am looking
for some help deciding what route to go. I was thinking of either the
Race-trim kit from Bus Boys or a Mesa Cooler from Aircooled_dot_net. I am
thinking I will go the biggest cooler, 96 plate, and add a thermostat this
fall before it gets cool out. Does anyone have experience with the Race
trim kit from Bus Boys? Does it come with everything I need, including
lines? I think I will mount the cooler under the cargo floor area of the
bus horizintally. Do you guys think the air flow there will be good or
should I try to locate the cooler somewhere where I can get better airflow
through the cooler, if so where? Oil temps on the bus have approaced 250
when pushing it hard on a warm day, sump mounted VDO sender and gauge. I
also like to tow a small sailboat total trailer and boat weight &lt;500 lbs.
With the mesa cooler I guess I would need the sandwich adapter at the
filter, the cooler and the hoses correct? Will the 96 plate cooler cause a
significant drop in oil pressure? I am running the stock oil pump. And my
last question, with out looking in Bentley, how much of a PITA is replacing
the oil pump on my type iv motor? Can it be done with the engine installed?
