Subject: Re: [T2] Oil pressure extension hose

 accessBob wrote                The fitting in my block is not metric, it
is NPT.  Anyone else?

I reply:
I was the second owner of my Westfalia and mine was definitely metric
thread. I used a piece of 1/8&quot; NTP with a 45 degree coupler and an
additional 2.75&quot; Piece of 1/8&quot; NTP to get the dual sender T out of my
way. Since then and being that I forced 1/8&quot; NTP short nipple with a
coupler into my metric orifice I went ahead and used a flexible grease
gun hose (7-8 inches long) to install my T fitting.

In a situation where there have been several owners I've found GM type
oil senders and a wide variety of non VW repairs and fixes on the Type IV
engines. The most common being the liberal use of silicone sealer
generously applied where there was previously a clean spot.

Whenever the VW Van or Vanagon gets down to #3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9th owner
things sort of disintegrate with neglect, confusion, and pure
indifference. That is when you buy cheap and start a ten year project.

The 1/8&quot; NTP sure looks like a fit until you screw it in and then go back
with your OEM sending unit, the difference is sure visible in the sealing
qualities of the OEM threads at that time.

I would not hesitate to say that 50% of all these ports are now NTP
threaded by previous owners.

However I wish I had forethought to verfify the thread and get an adapter
from my FLAP before I threaded it with 1/8&quot; NTP.
