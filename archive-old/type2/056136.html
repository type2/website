Subject: Re: Uh, which wires to coil? 76won't start after head 
    job(long).

&gt;
&gt;Labeled as positive I have:
&gt;
&gt;1:  The wire to the condenser
&gt;

This goes to negative.

&gt;2:  a white wire coming out of the loom that descends from the
&gt;auxilary heater blower.  The white wire heads towards the front-right
&gt;of the engine compartment.
&gt;
The white wire SHOULD be the rpm signal to the ECU.  Should also go on 
negative.  Look carefully, this wire should be part of the FI wiring 
harness (all white wires).


&gt;3.  A black wire coming out of the same loom as #2.  this wire has hot
&gt;current when the key is on and warms up the pos. coil connections when
&gt;1,2 and 3 are connected at once. 
&gt;
Sounds like the wire from the ignition switch.  Should go to pos.  
&gt;4.  A black wire with an in-line fuse coming from the left firewall.
&gt;
This should go to the positive, it is the back-up lights power supply.


&gt;On the Negative coil connection I have a tan wire with blue stripes
&gt;and 2 empty prongs.  
&gt;

The tan &amp; blue is probably for the VW diagnostic system.  I guess it 
goes on negative but it's not like you'll ever use it :-)

&gt;As noted, if I have the black wire (#3 above) connected with #1 and #2
&gt;on the + side of the coil, the heat would indicate that I am creating
&gt;a short.  Connected like this the bus will not crank.  If I remove the
&gt;hot #3 from the coil, the bus will crank but will not fire.  With the
&gt;ignition on, my test light indicates that none of the other wires are
&gt;hot.
&gt;
Part of this is because your condenser wire is hooked up to pos. when it 
should be hooked up to neg.  Likewise with the white FI wire.
