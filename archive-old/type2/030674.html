&gt; Two new questiions: I want to be able to useand ignition systenm that
&gt; has no points, what do you people suggest.  I have been looking as MSD
&gt; and Jacobs.  What has worked for you.

I'd suggest sticking with the stock distributer (or a rebuilt version
there of, if the old one has to much play..), adding a pertronixs point
replacement, and a CDI also.  The one JCW sells is made by Universal Corp,
and ol' Hoover loves it.;)

&gt; Second Holly and chris suggested putting in a 5speed transmission from a
&gt; vanagon or porche.  Any experience with this?  I did not know this was a
&gt; possibility, but I am very interested as I have though of this myself.


I used to have a copy of an email about a guy putting a 911 five speed in
his vanagon...EXTENSIVE modification to make it work, not to mention
gearing it down to where a bus could use it..

As for vanagon five speeds?  They are so rare that they may as well be
rumor only.  Seriously.  I was going to point you to the vanagon list's
archive, and tell you to search for &quot;5 speed&quot;...but it appears to be down.

http://gerry.vanagon_dot_com/archives/vanagon.html  is where it is, though.  A
few weeks ago, there was yet another major discussion concerning them.

Rare.

I'd say that if you are going with a 2l FI, stick with the 78-79 (77?)
tranny that goes along with it, unless you plan on investing a LOT of
money. (and or time..)

good luck.
