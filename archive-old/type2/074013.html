Subject: moustache bolts

while the List gurus have pronounced the factory specs, i will now chirp in
with some real-life advice: CHECK those holes before you go crankin' some
bolts into 'em!! case in point, my case! i was actually gonna ask the list
this very same question sunday, as i am putting my bar back on the bus
after some maintenance; the bolt in the LOWER hole was obviously too small
to snugly fit the case mount, but couldn't be much bigger or it wouldn't
fit THROUGH the bar... it appears that a PO has  put a helicoil in the
lower case mount, and i know for a fact it ain't metric: my 8x55 bolt
wouldn't fit. found an sae bolt, and it fit, but it is aluminum or some
such, so i need to go to the hardware store and look for a grade 8 version
of whatever the heck size it is.

you most likely can safely drive a bus w/out the lower bolt btw - i see it
all the time - but if vw coulda saved 10 pfennings w/ each case to leave em
off, they woulda. prolly best to have all 3.
