Does anybody have any input on a K&amp;N filter?  I have used them before on several v8's and have ALWAYS had positive results.  Does anyone use one on 2.0L?  What benefit/drawback?  Who has them?  I have seen them at BusBoys, but their website always locks up my computer with the damn 3 stooges wav file!  
Thanks
Mike
