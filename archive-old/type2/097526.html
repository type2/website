Gee, I didn't think I was &quot;pimping&quot; them to the list, just giving people
some info on something other than the usual petronix etc etc. :-) I recieved
mine from Pat as well, and it appears to be extremely well made, but being
made in Canada, I wouldn't expect anything else. The units are made in
Vancouver as you say on Cambie street, but that's all the info I have. I
havn'et installed mine yet cause to be honest the HiPer 2276 they're going
into is still in about a zillion pieces waiting to be assembled through the
winter. I expect and no doubt will realize that the system is indeed a good
piece of equipment.
Regards,
Courtney
