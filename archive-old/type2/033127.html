Subject: Re: turn signal problem

Amelia,
After looking at the circuit diagrams, I would suggest that the problem is 
in the emergency flasher switch. The fact that the emergency flashers work 
means that the relay that causes the flashing phenomenon is o.k. But when 
the switch is off, the circuit to power up the turn signal is supposed to be 
turned &quot;on&quot; in that position of the flasher switch. I think there is a dirty 
contact inside the flasher switch that is supposed to connect terminal #49 
and terminal #15 of that switch. I haven't tried to open such a switch to 
clean the contacts, but one thing you could try is to squirt contact 
cleaning spray inside the switch through any crack that gives you access and 
work the switch on and off to clean the contacts. Be sure to disconnect the 
negative terminal of the battery before doing this because there is 12 v at 
the switch at all times. If that doesn't work and you have nothing to lose( 
because it would require you to buy a new switch) try opening the switch to 
get a closer look at all the surfaces for cleaning.
I'll let others help out on the starting problem.
