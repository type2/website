Subject: Re: [T2] porsche style  cooling fan

&gt; &gt; The ad says never overheat again!
&gt;
&gt; &gt;From what I understand from all the debate that statement is true. What they
&gt;are not telling you in the ad is &quot;never get up to operating temperature
&gt;again!&quot;

That's correct. I am speaking as an owner of one of these kits. These kits 
only have about half the engineering they need for a factory fit and 
factory function on a VW engine. True that the 911 does not have flappers 
but I'm sure the Porsche factory compensated for that in some way.

The 911 kits need a flapper system and the easier way I've found (not 
actually built this yet) is to create lower tin following the Corvair design.

Enjoy.
