While I was working on the front of my '72 yesterday, I noticed that the top
two rivets on my spare tire carrier seem to have pulled out a bit at some
point.  There is about a 1/8&quot; gap between the top of the mount and the nose
of the bus.  The mount still seems to be nice and solid, but I know that the
gap shouldn't be there.   I would like to keep the spare on the front, as it
makes me feel a little safer and such, but don't want to chance having it
fall off and create chaos on the road.
I notice that there are six holes in the spare mount, but have never seen
the center holes used on any of the busses with front spares I have seen.
Can anybody recommend the best way (hardware type) to properly secure the
bracket?  Is this a common problem, or should I be really worried?

Thanks in advance,
Jay
