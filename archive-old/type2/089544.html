Subject: Name that noise

What could cause my bus (1973 high-roof camper, as stock as possible) to sound 
like I'm running snow tires or big 4x4 tires on the front at highway speeds?
  Kind of a growly whirring road noise.

I thought CVs grumbled from the rear (this sounds like it's in the front), and 
wheel bearings would make a squirrely noise.
