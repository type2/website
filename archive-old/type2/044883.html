&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; Thanks to &quot;No Quarter&quot;, you can view his e-version of the postal event
&gt; flyer for more info on this upcoming weekend's &quot;Busses Nowhere Near The
&gt; Arch #16&quot;.  The response has been huge, we should be buried in Type 2's on
&gt; Friday evening.  The flyer briefly explains the event, and Erin has
&gt; provided a link to the proper &quot;Mapquest&quot; regional map for the event.
&gt; Caution: if you print out the &quot;Mapquest&quot; map for use in getting to the
&gt; event, be sure to use the flyers' printed instructions to reach the
&gt; campground.  Idiosyncrasies in Mapquest would not allow Erin to place the
&gt; location &quot;red star&quot; in the actual location of the event on Mark Twain
Lake.
&gt;  It's about 4 to 5 miles off.  So, pay no attention to the &quot;red star&quot; as a
&gt; locater, and use the directions on his web site and you'll arrive safe and
&gt; sound at the largest gathering of Type 2's in the Midwest!  Remember to
&gt; arrive in a VW, because only VW's will be admitted into the event
&gt; campground!
&gt;
&gt; Thanks again to Erin for hosting the event flyer.  Many of us are looking
&gt; forward to meeting him in person, and checking out his Bus and the new
&gt; engine we've been reading about !  You'll find the flyer on his site at:
&gt;
&gt; http;//home.ispi_dot_net/~elassley.bie/bnnta/bnnta.htm
&gt;
&gt; We can't wait to see everybody!
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; p.s.  Could someone who is on the Vanagon List forward this to them?
Thank
&gt; you!
