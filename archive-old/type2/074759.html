Subject: retractable seat belts

Hi Volks,
Does anyone know if the front retractable seat belts
that are in vanagons will bolt into a '78 Bay Window?
I read some posts on getting them from J.C. Whitney
but they are $119 EACH!!!
I hope to get a set and just bolt them in place.
Vanagon seat belts seem to be an easy and cheaper
score. Ideas, Opinions, finger signs??
