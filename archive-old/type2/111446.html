&gt; &gt; ... Caveat Emptor, it is up to you...
&gt;
&gt; I always list every possible thing wrong with a vehicle before I sell it.
&gt; Make a list, and give it to prospective buyers.  I've never had one come
&gt; back due to &quot;Hey, the whatzitdohickey was broken and you didn't tell me
&gt; about it!&quot; Syndrome.
&gt;
&gt; Granted, I sometimes lose a few bucks on the selling price, but it's a small
&gt; price to pay for the peace of mind.

No matter what condition the vehicle I'm selling is in, the phrase &quot;this
vehicle is being sold in as-is condition without warranty&quot; is on the bill
of sale.  I'm honest about the vehicle, but I'm not a dealer and I haven't
the resources to warranty the vehicle.
