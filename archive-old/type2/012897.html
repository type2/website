&gt; what is a &quot;gene berg oil temperature dip stick&quot; ?

Gene Berg makes a replacement dip stick for type I, II, III and IV air
cooled motors that has a wire that you connect in line with your oil
pressure sensor. Then when your engine starts to get to hot the oil light
starts to flicker, when it overheats the oil light goes on solid. Then you
know if your about to overheat your motor. 

There explanation is much better

And goto the part that starts with &quot;How To Know When Your Engine Is Hot&quot;
