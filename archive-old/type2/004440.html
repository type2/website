Ok, after lurking  for a while now, I'm finaly going to take the plunge and
ask all you knowlegable people some questions.....
First, how do I find out how many cc's i have on my engine?
Second, someone told me it was possible to find out exactly what was wrong
with my engine (it needs a rebuild) by doing something called a &quot;blow down
test&quot;. Is this true? Could someone explain the process to me (who is just
learning)?
Thanks
