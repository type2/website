&gt;Sir, For some reason my computer can not submit my form so I am mailing you
&gt;directly. You have my permission to post any of this information. I drive a
&gt;1978 Westfalia, that is currently broken in Rawlings, WY. I had just got
off
&gt;80West and was about to enter 287 North to Jackson when a semi pulled in
&gt;front of me. I hit the brakes and she died. She won't restart. It sounds
&gt;like she wants to but it won't spark (or somehting). I have tried
everything
&gt;that usually works...jump start, push start, touch the starter with a
&gt;screwdriver. One said it may be the fuel pump has gone out? Contact me with
&gt;any helpful info. on a place that may repair it in the area.
&gt;growbananas1_at_excite_dot_com or (307)7321943 or my cell (417)8403684
