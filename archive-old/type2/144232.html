Subject: Re: [T2] looking for van prints

are you just interested in old photos? or can it just be black and white... just making sure and being specific...
 
if they must be in black and white kodak has a program easyshare that you can use to change any photo to black and white or cartoonish or diffrent things i am sure there are also diffrent programs besides kodak but thats the one i use....
 
if its old photos good luck but i am sure some of the bus drivers got some old photos they can at least scan for ya maybe?
