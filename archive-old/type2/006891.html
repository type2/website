Subject: Re: [T2] rheostat failure

Hiya John,

I don't know the number of the tool but there is one around for removing the 
escutcheons.  I believe that RMMW had one in their catalog.  Truth be told, I 
have always used a pair of needlenose pliers for this job.  Not too graceful 
but they do the job.

Mike
