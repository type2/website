Subject: Open letter to Tommy and the List

&gt; A comment on what this has to do with VW buses
might be in order.
&gt; This is not a Christian prayer list.  You might
try reviewing the list
&gt; guidelines.

Well Tommy, understand this.  The list rules
apply to some list comments a little more than
others.  As has been said, all animals are equal,
but some are more equal than other.  In the same
way, some political and religious comments are
more equal than others.  

The great folks on this list tend to have a
certain political bend which I dare say
represents a far extreme of political thought. 
Moreover, they are quick to ensure that you don't
express opposition to those ideas.  Tolerance is
the key.  You must tolerate rambling antiwar,
antibush, antirightwingconspiratcy diatribes, but
mention prayer, or g*ns or any other topic
perceived to be right wing and they will tolerate
you right off the list.   Some tolerance is more
equal than others.  

My personal favorite is the antisuv stuff we must
hear every three weeks or so.   (Lets see, what
kind of vehicle, other than the SUV, gets 17-20
mpg, is much more likely to tip over than your
average family car, pollutes far more than your
average 2k model car, and is generally considered
unsafe by the Naderites?  Hmmmm....)

I'm going to a VW bus to pray for the astronauts
families and our soldiers too.
