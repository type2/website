X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

hello all,
  A week or two ago we were all talking about the lock on the engine lids
and where to get them. If anyone wants one, I found one in my shed. Its
black, not chrome, so its for the later 70 Bus, but will fit all 68-79
Buses. It does not have a key, but does have the key code on it. I had a key
cut by the code for $15. I am in Tacoma Wa. if any one wants it, you can
have it for $10 + shipping. Its light so shipping will be less than $5 in
the US. Or if you want I can have a key made and it will be $30(to cover
time and gas)
