when I rebuilt my 2liter (more or less stock) last year I had the
crank/connect/pistons balanaced to 1gram. compression ratio equalized to
two decimal places.... not perfect but much better than VW specs.

didn't know these engines would run so smoothly !!!!

(auto tranny so no flywheel to balance. but on a manual do that too)
