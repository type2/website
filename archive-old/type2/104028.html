Subject: Dash

Stan,

Welcome to the list,
 
Won't find that dash in a catalogue for our buses Stan.
It'll be a junkyard or Famous Internet Auction Site.
I frequently see them on the auction site for minimal dollars.

Also, if the problem is with the metal on top, or the rubber bumper that seperates the metal top from the front panel, both those are seperate pieces.

&gt;I reciently bought a '79 bus and have started the
&gt;process to restore it.  Until I get an engine
&gt;installed I'm getting it ready for painting by taking
&gt;off everything that doesn't move and setting traps for
&gt;what does.  Once question I have is does anyone know
&gt;of a place where I can purchase a dashboard.  I have
&gt;check some of the larger sites catalogue but found
&gt;nothing.  Any help is appreciated.
