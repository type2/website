Subject: Re: Cold Start Valve Malfunction Question...

Tom:

Your &quot;black box&quot; (ECU?) and #2 temp sensor have NOTHING to do with the 
Cold Start Valve.  

The cold start valve is wired to be energized (i.e., let fuel into the 
air distribution box) ONLY WHEN THE IGNITION SWITCH IS IN THE &quot;START&quot; 
position.  The ECU and the #2 temp sensor don't interact at all with the 
cold start valve, don't even know it's there.

If the engine is warm, then the cold start valve &quot;senses&quot; that itself and 
won't energize and inject fuel.  If the engine is cold, then the cold 
start valve will &quot;sense&quot; that and will energize and inject fuel (with the 
key in the &quot;Start&quot; position) for a short period of time.

I'd suspect either a leaky cold start valve, that is a purely mechanical 
problem, or some sort of wiring problem.

&gt; I remember having a problem about 6 months ago where the #3 cyl head temp
&gt; sensor wire came loose, and triggered the ColdStart Valve to operate, flooding
&gt; and shutting the motor down.  (replaced sensor).  I unplugged the CSV, and
&gt; Viola, no more problem. (Other than the shaking loosening up my fan and sheet
&gt; metal - if this happens to you, check all your bolts!!) So the problem is
&gt; solved, but I have no CSV now.
&gt; 
&gt; My question- What would cause the CSV to operate at the wrong time,
&gt; sporadically, other than the #3 temp. sensor?  Is this a sign my black box is
&gt; going?  Can they be rebuilt, or do they have to be replaced?  Is there a
&gt; checkout procedure for the black box to see if mine's OK or shot?
