Subject: RE: [T2] Sugar in gas tank

I agree, removing the gas tank and getting it boiled is the proper way to do
things. Since I have never taken my engine out, nor do I have a place to do
it, I needed to clean it out the best that I could. So removing the L pipe and
flushing it that way worked for me.

I am also able to remove the firewall and change all the fuel vent lines
without removing the tank also. For me this was the way to go.

I will definitely remove the tank and have it boiled when I have to pull the
engine. Hopefully by then my garage is finished.

&quot;Frankly for the cost and little trouble, I would remove the tank and get it
&quot;boiled&quot; out by a radiator shop? Gives you a chance to double check all the
hoses.&quot;
