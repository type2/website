Subject: Re: [T2] Clock wiring for 1978 Westfalia

Hi Richard,

&gt; Someone told me once that clock power came from B+ on the emergency

To see a bus in a junkyard is rare enough in Toronto. To see a bus in a 
junkyard with a clock in it, well, that's pushing hard to believe. 
Seeing two buses with clocks in junkyards ?? Not in my lifetime.

At least, not unless I move to from _dot_ca to sunny CA.

Happy trails,
