Subject: Re: [T2] Hot Start Relay Question 

At 09:05 8/23/2002 -0600, you wrote:
&gt;[...]
&gt;The relay in line will not extend the life of the solenoid on the 
&gt;starter.  It is there to reduce the current path from the battery to the 
&gt;starter solenoid allowing heavier current flow to it.  The solenoid will 
&gt;still be doing the same job under the same conditions.
&gt;Two main  causes of clicking starter solenoids are:
&gt;not enough current/voltage  (low battery, over long small guage current path)
&gt;solenoid breaking down (heated worn contacts kicking out, overheated 
&gt;stressed coil dropping out)
&gt;
&gt;Most bad starters are just the solenoid portion.  It takes a major beating 
&gt;doing its job.  Many fords have the solenoid remoted from the starter 
&gt;where it is quickly and easily replaced.  It is not unusual to find an 
&gt;older ford of this type still running on its original starter but 3rd or 
&gt;4th solenoid.
===========================&gt;
Another advantage of the hot start relay modification is that the ignition 
switch assembly is now activating a low current circuit (relay coil) as 
opposed to the original design higher current circuit.
I like knowing this each time I start up 'cuz I ain't too keen on wanting 
to ever change out that ignition switch assembly.
