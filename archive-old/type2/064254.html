Subject: Pilot shaft bearing

Hey folks--

I have a 78 2L FI engine, and I'm trying to figure out how to get the pilot
shaft bearing out of the end of the crank.  Any good ideas?  Most of the
books have no useful info, if anything at all.  If you have an answer, please
email me directly, as I cant always get to all the digests.  
TIA, 
Ned
