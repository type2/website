Hello everybody:

I've got a '77 FI bus that's been runnin' great; until I tried to fire her
up the other morning.  It sits there and cranks but doesn't fire up and
start!  Last night my buddy and I performed some tests, and here's what we
came up with.  I pulled the center connection off of the distributer cap and
checked that for spark which would tell me if my coil was working, right?
Well, I got the spark so I think I'm OK there.  We then pulled a plug out
and cranked on the ignition in which case I should see the spark jump
between the gap in the plug....
correct?  There wasn't a spark there.  Could this be my condesor that needs
replacing?  Another note---I could smell gas when the engine was being
cranked.  Also, I did charge up the battery just in case it was a little low
and wouldn't be able to fire the injectors.  Any help from some of you
novice bus experts would be extremely appreciated!!!

Thanks,
Chet
