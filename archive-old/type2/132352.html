&gt; No No No.  Never put anything oily on brake pads

Which is why I said remove the pads. Stick them in a box until later.

&gt; or rotors or drums or
&gt; shoes.  Try as hard as you will there will always be some residual unless  you
&gt; take 
&gt; the rotors off and immerse them in solvent.

Quality rotors come from the factory with protective coating to prevent
rust. I don't see the difference.

&gt; A little rust will  come off after a few applications of the brakes.

Rust = pitting = less surface area for braking. I've left rotors sit on the
bus for a couple of years and the results aren't pretty. The rust won't come
off:

6 months is no big deal but if the storage is lengthy, something
preventative needs to be done just as the mfgr does to keep the rotor
preserved on the shelf.
