Let's try this again. My first reply bombed :)

I have heard that the original 1968 VW Westy poptop was smooth. After several months of production the top was redesigned with the ribbing to add strength as well as reduce resonant shaking at highway speeds.

On another related topic, 1968 highroof panels supposedly had metal roofs for a few months before they were redesigned in fibreglass. They also added ribbing for strength. I have seen pics of versions with high slider doors and regular. I wonder is Wesrfalia made the fixed hightop roofs for VW?
