I need to appologize to the list and to Ron and the folks at Bus Depot.

I posted a message asking about the shipping time from Bus Depot last
week, and it seems I may have generated an unwanted thread.  My order
arrived today, and it is great. Quality merchandise at a very reasonable
price.  Had I just been patient and waited all would have been fine.  The
order arrived in 10 working days, just like Ron said it would.

Sorry for the trouble,
Ed Maikranz
