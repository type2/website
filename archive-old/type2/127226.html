&gt; &gt; Does anyone know why http://www.everybus_dot_com/ is down?
&gt;
&gt; I've contacted the appropriate people and they will be looking into it
&gt; when they get home from work (where the computer is hosted).
&gt;
&gt; More than likely a power outage or some such.

It would be lovely to be able to blame it on that but I have to blame it
on an incompetent systems admin who modified httpd.conf then did a reboot
and went off to work WITHOUT &quot;MAKE&quot;ing httpd.conf before doing the reboot.
The problem has been corrected (now that I am home), all is well in
dworkin's den of computer iniquity, and Greg Potts may have an
announcement to make tomorrow (or not, it's up to him :-)
