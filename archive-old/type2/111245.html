&gt; Owning a VW is new to me so foregive me if i don't know the terminology.
&gt; I have a 1971, 8 passenger bus (transporter?) and will fixing it up this year.
&gt; I would like to lower and restore it. but don't have any stores in Santa
&gt; Barbara. So here are my following question:

First of all, you can restore it or lower it, but not both!

&gt; 1) Are there different ways to lower it?

Yes.  You can get lowering spindles, or put adjusters into the beam.  The
rear of the bus can be lowered by simply turning the splines.

&gt; 2) If there is, which is the best way?

The least destructive is the lowering spindles.  The original spindles can
be reinstalled easily when you get tired of the wierd handling.

&gt; 3) On average about how much does it cost?

To do it right, a few hundred dollars.

&gt; 4) Are there any good companies to buy restoration or after market parts
&gt; from?

Several vendors participate in the list  I've personally dealt with Ronnie
at oldvolkshome_dot_com and Ron at busdepot_dot_com and found them to be very
helpful.

&gt; 5) Can you buy the proper interior paint in a spray can?

I've seen some nice spray can jobs.  The brand of
paint is not nearly as important as the preparation of the surface.

&gt; Sorry if this sounds kinda cheap useing a spray can but liveing in S.B. is not
&gt; cheap... doing the best i can with what i got!

If you're worried about money, forget about lowering and put the money
into getting the bus into the best stock shape as you can.  You'll be much
happier that way.
