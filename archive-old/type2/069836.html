Amen to that! When my friend Norm was younger and less wise than today, he
was proud owner of a '69 bus for which he spent a whole summer building custom
camping interior. He spent the better part of a year discovering America (and 
himself) from coast to coast in his bus. At some point he noticed,&quot;Hm... This 
fuel line (to the fuel filter, I believe) doesn't have a clamp on it and it 
seems to come off without much trouble. Oh well...&quot; BAD CALL!

About two weeks later a guy pulled up next to him at a stoplight to helpfully 
point out,&quot;Hey, your engine is on fire!&quot; Ak!!! In the next 6 minutes, Norm stood
helplessly ringing his hands and dying a thousand deaths watching his beloved 
bus burn up before his eyes. For all his travels, he didn't have a fire 
extinguisher. The fire department showed up sometime after that to extinguish
what by then was a smoking, gutted hulk.

When a fuel line goes in a bus and a fire starts, the tank feeds 
fuel by gravity, steadily, until the tank is empty. It's not a pretty sight,
and it costs more than the vehicle is worth to restore it afterwards.
Norm harbored illusions of restoring his bus for almost a year before he finally
sold it to a guy for parts. It joined all those other buses with burned out rear
ends bleaching their bones in junkyards across our nation. 

It is so much easier to replace your fuel lines before your bus burns up than 
afterwards. Old fuel lines kill more VW's than anything except rust, and they 
do it real fast. Check them annually, and replace at the first sign of 
stiffness. Replacing on general principle every few years is a great idea. 
After my friend's experience, a few extra &quot;unecessary&quot; hose clamps sound like 
a pretty good idea to me.

Drive safely,
Surfer Bob
