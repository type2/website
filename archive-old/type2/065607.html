Subject: bus toys

Regarding bus toys...

I recently picked up some small bus toys in England and wondering if they
are very sought after etc.  I haven't collected anything for 3 years so I'm
wondering if Lledo die cast toys are worth buying. These are made in England
(size well...about 1&quot; by 2.5&quot; long) the doors don't open or anything.  The
buses are 1955 panel vans, one a commerative Pepsi sign on both sides in a
cool Pepsi box and the other a 7-up commerative bus with green 7-up box.
There's detail on the outside of the bus, and a plastic steering wheel
inside with plastic windows. 

Are these a thing of the past for collectors?  I think they're cool.  Oh,
and I paid 8 bucks each for them. 

Cheers,
