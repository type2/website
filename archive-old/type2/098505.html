&gt; Hello, does anyone have this piece of tin to sell me? The rear tin for a
&gt; 1600 block with doghouse cooler, to fit to the firewall on my 70 bus? Also,
&gt; if anyone has one around and a digital camera, I'd appreciate a picture so I
&gt; can know what it looks like and whether I can fab something to replace it if
&gt; necessary with a sheet of heavy rubber or something similar. Any suggestions
&gt; welcomed.

That would be the _front_ tin!  Front is front!  :)

If you can't find this rather rare piece of tin ('71-only) you can
manufacture your own from the similar piece from a doghouse Bug.  You need
to add a piece of sheet metal to the bug tin to match the shape of the bus
firewall opening.  That is exactly how VW did it!
