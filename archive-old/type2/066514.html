Subject: electrical mess - 65 camper

first of all, i didn't feel like going and getting another wheel bearing.  so
i started messing with the wires.   the wiper motor turned on when i pulled
the knob, but it made a horrible noise and anyway both pivot are broken, so i
pulled it.  either i can get a 67 unit to put it, though i am told it wont
fit well because of frame differences (?)  or use the new pivots found in an
old vw shop .

left turn signals work.   right side the front glows, the rear does nothing.
  when i put the rear  bulb in the front it blinks.  go figure.   

saw some stuff hanging out the heat vent s by the floor.  pulled out some
seat stuffing, it looked like an old mouse nest.  yes, complete with small
dried mouse. 8:&gt;

head lights dont work, but the dash lights do.  after stepping on the high
beam pedal a couple times they do on low, only the right on high (or is it
the other way around).   left tail light works, not the right.   there is an
extra (broken) switch wired on the dash, no interior light switch on the side
of the pod, and no interior lights work.   

i dont believe in electricity.    i may have to deal with it, but i dont like
it.  but i have this suspicious  nagging feeling that i may have to break
through that mental block i have so carefully cherished.   :(

so i went and got a wheel bearing and finished the left front brake job.
