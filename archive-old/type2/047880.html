It's not difficult to cool 90hp; it's another matter to cool 150.

Subject: [T2] Turbo on TypeII- Follow on Question


&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; I found this thread really interesting with regards to the cooling aspect.
&gt; Can anyone out there compare the turbo setup (cooling and powerwise) to
the
&gt; old judson supercharger installation for the 36 and 40 HP motors? I'm
&gt; thinking of the fact that the Judson setups have the marvel oiler as well
&gt; which is said to both lubricate and reduce operating temps.
&gt;
&gt; I realize that this may be more of a vintage bus question but enquiring
&gt; minds want to know....;-) Please P-mail instead if you feel the reply is
not
&gt; appropriate content for the list.
&gt;
&gt; TIA,
&gt;
