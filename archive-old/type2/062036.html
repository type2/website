I had a problemattic turn signal switch, it sounds like you have a dead short
(a posative wire grounding) somewher in there. There are something like 8
wires, and some of them are souldered (sp) in the most god-awful places.
repace the turn signal switch. I have learned from recent, very hard and
expensive expierence not to ignore those little electrical &quot;eccentricities&quot;.
Fix it, or get some one who can to fix it.

Dont procrastinate: electrical fires suck!
