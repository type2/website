Subject: Re: [T2] Help! - Now it's gas in MY oil!

That's valuable feedback Greg. In my mind I imagined that running rich
would yield minor contamination. Who would have thought that the extra
gas in the combustion chamber would have such a great effect on the
oil. But certainly Collie's situation of having a FI bus eliminates
the possibility of leaking through the fuel pump.

I think I panicked prematurely. My oil does not feel different than
normal as far as my fingers can tell, and the odor of gas, while
strong enough for my wife to smell is not strong enough for me to
smell. She is sensitive to smell and I do not have a good sense of
smell. So I think we caught this in time. The 2-3 inches over full as
a one time reading must have been a fluke of the filter drain back
valve.

Thanks again,

John

  From what I remember, the oil level was high, the oil was thin and it
 reeked of gas. Collie was draining the oil prior to a complete engine
 rebuild at the time, so we weren't too worried about it at the time.
