Subject: Dizzy connections

I had that same prob with the dual carbs and dizzy on my '73.  If you look
closely there will be rwo connections on your carb and they will be
slightly different sizes.  So will the ones on your dizzy.  Same size to
same size.  This has always worked for me but maybe bot for your paticular
model.

good luck
