Subject: [T2] gas heater question

I have a BN2 heater and I just installed a never used
30 year old glow plug.  Problem is that the glow plug
doesn't get hot enough to ignite the gas.  As soon as
I  jumper 12 volts to the plug, it fires right off,
but with the normal 4 volts it only glows a dull
orange and won't ignite the gas.  Any ideas?
