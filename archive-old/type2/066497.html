Spkaing of noise in the tire vicinity, I had this awful knowcking sound 
start in the parking lot of movie theatre a couple weeks ago and 
couldn't figure out what it was.  Well, I stopped before driving the 20 
minutes back to school (on dark Wisconsin roads) and felt around the 
tire thinking something got stuck in it and figured that was easier than 
prying the hubcap off sans the cool little hubcap puller I have been 
wanting for a while.  Well, nothing was anywhere around the tire and 
nowhere on the inside eeither, so I checked the nuts with my hand and 
scary I could tighten them by hand.  Three lugs were about to fall off 
and the tire was sqeaking out and then knocking back into place as a 
drove.  Sure glad it didn't fall off- I've heard some bad stories about 
that!
