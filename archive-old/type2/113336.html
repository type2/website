Subject: name that engine

Well,

I spent most of the weekend under the bus and emerged more confused 
than enlightened.  I was in the process of chasing down exhaust leaks 
and was not very successful.  The PO said that the bus (a 76 
Adventurewagen) has a 79 engine.  It is a 2 liter engine so that jives 
but it has the 75-78 exhaust on it so, what does that mean? The car was 
from California so I am assuming the exhaust system is a sacrifice to 
the gods of smog.

My problem is that it is getting cold and I want to have the bus be 
quiet and somewhat warm in the coming months.  I am willing to replace 
the existing heater boxes with 79's and replace the rest of the exhaust 
as well but I have to figure out what I have.  Is there any way to tell 
what the heads are without pulling the exhaust off or do I have to pull 
it apart to check the ports?  Would the oval port manifolds fit (even 
badly) on the square port heads?

All help is appreciated,

Thanks,

Dave Williams

76 Adventurewagen (Loud)
