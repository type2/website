&gt; Huh, well I've seen the inside of the fan housing more times
&gt; than I wanted to, but your arguement is convincing, Sean. Especially
&gt; since it doesn't make sense that they would design it to force air
thru
&gt; the oil cooler when the engine is cold. But that is what it looked
like
&gt; it was doing to me. And also since my oil temps in really cold weather
&gt; are lower than it seems they should be.

Oil cooling is regulated by the flow of oil through the cooler.  Cold,
thick oil doesn't flow well, causing most of the oil to bypass the
cooler and remain warm.  The oil cooler (at least in doghouse type 1s)
always gets maximum airflow.

&gt; So I guess before next Winter, I'll try sticking a new
&gt; thermostat and cable on. But I'll wait until cold weather, not much
&gt; point in doing it now. 8-)
&gt; With watercooled engines I always put in the hotest temp
&gt; thermostat that you can use, as the higher temps improve efficiency,
but
&gt; aircooled usually run too hot. One thing that is a mystery to me is
why
&gt; there isn't more heat transfer from the cyl/heads to the crankcase.

For heat transfer to take place, there has to be a heat path.  The
only heat path from the heads to the cases is the cylinders, studs,
and pushrod tubes.  These don't amount to much for heat conduction
purposes.  The only other way heat gets to the oil is via the oil
pumped through the pushrods to the head that then flows back through
the pushrod tubes.
