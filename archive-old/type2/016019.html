I am so excited. I'm actually driving around now. The engine seems to have
mellowed out. The brakes are working fine. I got a friend to help me with
making a new canvas pop-up. She did an excellent job and it only cost about
$120. Now to put it back in :(! Hey, one thing is bothering me. The boots
on the CV joints - They'er busted. Does anyone make a replacable boot that
doesn't require removing the axle? Also, I still have no turning signals.
The flasher may be bad. Where is the flasher located? Thaks!
