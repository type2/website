Subject: MPG &amp; miscalculations? (caution : inexperience ahead)

Hola,

So im trying to prepare for a fairly long trip, the first actually in my, 
new to me, bus. (i could never take the 65beetle 1800 miles!)
And in my preparations I wanted to get an idea of what I was hitting for 
MPG. So I wrote down my miles and filled it as far as I could, and then when 
I filled up all the way next, used the miles from then till now and the 
gallons to fill it this time to figure my MPG, and I hit about 20 on the 
nose.

I was pretty happy about this until the following reading, at about 13!  How 
can you factor in how much gas your really going through, I dont want to 
keep pumping it even though it wants to stop, its annoying and I dont want 
gas all over myself in the morning.

Are there are little tricks to monitor this for a more acurate reading? I 
would like to figure it out so I can rely on how many miles ive gone versus 
watching the gas gage as it shows me at empty when I have at least 7 or 8 
gallons left!

Outside of that I got my fules lines replaced, and im going in to have a Oil 
Temp Guage installed next week. Fire extinguisher ready, and some westy 
cabinets and a zbed are in the works (ohhmmmmm). Im mounting the spare back 
up front for the extra space (mental note to self, check spare quality out, 
havent taken a look yet).

ok, im done ranting, if you have any tips to pass on, im all ears and 
ambition!
