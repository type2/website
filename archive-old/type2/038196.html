It is impossible to adjust valves if u do not know what valves are and what
they do!
I think everybody on this list wants to explain what it is and why it is
necessary but it's more easy to take a good book and read at your ease! The
best way to learn. The above books are perfect. maybe other people know even
more basic books about how an engine works etc.
Take care and cu around.

&gt; Sorry, I'm new to some things.  What exactly does valve adjustment
&gt; involve?  I've seen the postings on it, but what exactly do you do?  How
&gt; does it affect the engine?  All that good stuff, never done it before,
&gt; I'm just a (very) basic engine guy, I don't think I've ever taken the
&gt; valve covers off.
