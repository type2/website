Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Levels

&gt; stick in 6 times and come up with 5 readings

That's weird, I never really had that problem with the 1600 engine in my
Type 2. But I DO have problems reading the ATF-level in my 1971
Fastback, but that's a different mailinglist I guess. By the way: nobody
could help me there as well, so my advice is: just try to keep the oil
level as close to maximum as possible (as far as you can read it
anyway), a little bit too much oil won't hurt I think.
