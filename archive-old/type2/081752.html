Subject: Re: Engine dies   :)      Weber Progressive carb now

It runs, it runs!!!

Apparently I had a dirty carb. I took it apart and cleaned it with carb
cleaner, blowing out the fittings with holes (jets?) and reassembled it.

It took a few seconds for the gas to do its thing, but it fired up and drove
around the block real good.

A more extensive test drive is in order, but I am ready for a shower and a
cigar!!

I couldn't have done it without the list. Another $125 or so saved.

&gt; Hey Rob,
&gt;
&gt; The fuel spray you are seeing is from the accelerator pump.  This spring
&gt; loaded diaphragm pushes a stream of fuel out of the top (emmulsion?)tube
&gt; when the accelerator is pushed in.  This spray should be even and strong
&gt; (not a dribble).
&gt;
&gt; The vacuum from the running engine pulls the rest of the fuel charge when
&gt; running. So it is difficult to tell what other thing might or might not be
&gt; clogged.
&gt;
&gt; Eric Bradway just rebuilt one of these about a month ago... Eric are you
out
&gt; there?  He may be in Vermont on a journey now because I have not heard
from
&gt; him lately...  Anyway Eric is good technically and would be helpful here.
&gt;
&gt; ...  From my experiences if you have a good accelerator pump stream it
will
&gt; run... To some degree at least, to make it to FMIJ :)  Granted idle sucks.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Good Luck,

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I removed my single weber carb and cleaned it up. I blew it out and looked
&gt; it over. The floats seem to work and there is a pointy needle that stops
the
&gt; gas flow. That works. I cleaned the gas screen on the carb.
&gt;
&gt; Holding the carb in my hand, I attached the fuel line to the carb and the
&gt; fuel pump (temporary electric) comes on I can see the gas bubbling through
&gt; the filter. I now realize that the chamber fills with gas. It does I am
&gt; sure. When I open the throttle all the way gas sprays out of the bottom of
&gt; the carb in a burst, but thats all unless I close the throttle and open it
&gt; again. Should the gas keep coming out if I leave the throttle held open?
Or
&gt; am I lacking vacum from the engine or something? To a person who doesn't
&gt; know it seems the gas should keep flowing out. I'd like to know before I
&gt; tear it down further or bolt it back on for a test so thanks for any
&gt; insight!!
&gt;
&gt; If it is supposed to keep flowing there must be something else clogged I
&gt; didn't notice.
&gt;
&gt; (spark and fuel all the way to the carb has been established..thanks)
