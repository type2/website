Subject: Re: New to list and a question

&gt;
&gt;Hi all -
&gt;
&gt;I am new to the list and am hoping that you all can give me some advice on 
&gt;my 'new' bus.
&gt;
&gt;Wednesday I purchased a 1975 deluxe bus with an automatic trans. When I got 
&gt;it home, yesterday, I noticed that the engine smelled VERY hot. It is about 
&gt;40 miles from my place to the place where I bought the bus. The trip to my 
&gt;house was on the freeway, doing between 50 - 65 mph.
&gt;
&gt;I haven't had a chance to do anything to it yet, but am planning on, at 
&gt;least,  changing the oil this weekend. While I am playing &quot;mechanic&quot;, what 
&gt;should I look for that may have caused the hot smell?
&gt;
&gt;

  Haven't seen any replies to this so I'll give it a shot.

 The tune-up comes first, along with that oil change, often that
over heating is from bad timing.

 If its's over heating like you say and you don't have the tools yet
ie timing light, compression tester feeler gage etc., take it to a 
shop this first time.

 My local shop will hit me a $60 bill to do this. 

 You think that's a lot, wait till you have to replace that engine.

 What the list needs is a lot of data to give you any accurate &quot;guesses&quot;.

 Includes mileage on the engine. Type of engine (get the serial # off
fan shroud), when last serviced. type distributor, plugs (I found 1/2
plugs in a van of your type, S/B 3/4&quot;), compression on all 4 pistons,
timing, type of oil and wt.,anything else you can think of.

 Big item is the condition of the hoses and wires. Is the engine 
sealed around compartment. Are skirts on the plugs in place?

 You give it a shot and we'll give it a shot. Between the two you should
come out alright.

 You do need a couple books. I would start with the &quot;Haynes&quot; manual
altho as a &quot;Newbie&quot; you should have the John Muir book too.
 Later you may want the VW service manual but it's pricey and not 
necessary unless you're in real deep.

 I have left out endless reams I imagine but it should get you started.
