Hey everyone,

  I would like to say thank you to everyone who offered help on my carb 
problem the other day.  Now for my windshield question.  I have a 77 westy.  
The windshield has a tinted stip across the top.  When a drive I have to 
look right through this thing.  It's not so bad during the day, but at night 
it's kind of a pain.  I also have a 74 westy for parts and it's windshield 
doesn't have this strip.  I'm going to paint soon so the windshield is 
coming out for rust repair and a better paint job.  Will the 74 glass fit 
the 77.  I'm going to turn into a hunch back if I don't do something about 
this.  Thanks for any help.

                                                       Justin
