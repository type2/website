&gt;&gt;&gt;fried my transformer by not remembering to unplug the 110 cord


Teddy, there are TWO fuses on the transformer.  One that is visible from the 
outside of teh transformer, and it unscrews, and one that is under the metal 
casing, and it opops into two sets of fingers.

I 'blew' a 110V AC -&gt; 12V DC (2 amp) transformer, something I was using for 
a piano keyboard.  I opened the case and found the tiny .5 amp fuse I blew.  
  went to radio shack and easily found replacements.


For the VW transformer, the screw in fuse, I got from Fischers in 
Sringfield.
