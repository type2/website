Subject: Re: [T2] Grey hubcaps

Hi,

According to the VW partscatalogue microfiche:

The correct colorcode for the 1968-1970 hubcab is
'L70'. So this is for the models with drumbrakes only.

The ones with discbrakes front (1971-1979) have a
chrome kind of color: 'L91'

&gt; Certain westys came with grey hubcaps
&gt; My euro bought 66 
&gt; westy did, but my american export 66 westy came with
&gt; chrome hubcaps .

This is baywindow specific info:
Standard the bus has grey hubcabs it has chrome
hubcabs when:

- it has M181 (&quot;chrome hubcabs&quot;)
- it has M524 (&quot;US specs&quot; for Type 22 or Type 28 this
meant  additional chrome trim)
- it is a Type 24 (= &quot;microbus deluxe&quot;, so far I
didn't find one in US-version. the US Microbuses LOOK
LIKE they're deluxe because they have chrome trim due
to M524)

For M-codes see the M-plate in your bus. It is fixed
behind the driversseat on the metal partition. On
1977-1979 baywindows it is fixed under the dash on top
of the fresh air duct right of the fusebox.

  (yes I know it needs updating :-)

yours,
