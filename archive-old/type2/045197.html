&gt; &gt; Getting ready to drop the engine/tranny in China Cat. She's the new family

&gt; &gt; these special bolts...either what to use as a makeshift or where to buy it. 
&gt; &gt; Is this something available at the NWFLAPS? If so, what it the size 
&gt; &gt; nomenclature?
&gt; 
&gt; sometimes called &quot;TORX&quot; I found a set of Metric inserts that fit into a
&gt; regular socket that work fine, found em at PEP Boys a local FLAPS for
&gt; about $10 

No, it's not a Torx!  It's a &quot;triple square&quot;, which is readily available
from VW parts suppliers.  A Torx might work, but it's likely that it will
damage the bolt so that the correct wrench won't work anymore.
