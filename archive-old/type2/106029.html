&gt; Well said Tom.  I think the best you can do is if the time spent above and
&gt; below .5V is approximately equal.  Look for a frequency in the neighborhood of
&gt; 1-2 cycles/second (Hz).

The voltage should fluctuate say for example, between 0.80 and .20 volts
when lambda = 1.0 because the 02 content in the exhaust will fluctuate.
Above and below that the numbers should be more stable.

An analog voltmeter with a fine scale would be best to use unless you have
access to a quality digital unit, especially one that can record averages,
graph, etc.

Does everyone agree that a stable voltage on the high side (slightly rich)
would produce the best overall results (low CO, low HC and low NOx)?
