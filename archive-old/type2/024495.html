Subject: re oil gauge accuracy
Content-Disposition: inline

Some time back I copied the below info from someone who had posted this to
the list.  I cannot remember who wrote this, so I apologize for not being
able to give the person credit for this information.  This will permit you
to easily and accurately check you gauge/sender combo.

The post was as follows

Driving on hot days, I cringe as I watch my Oil temp Gauge (on my '72
Westy with a  2000 cc ) go past 250 to about 260 or 270 degrees. (is
this too hot on a type 4? ) I thought my gauge might be wrong. (it
wasn't)

VDO sent me the following info to determine if my gauge is working
properly.  I thought some of you may find it useful.
This for a 300 degree F gauge.
The following is a chart comparing temp to ohms.  You must test the
sender with it disconnected
from the gauge and please check and make sure there is no sealant on the

threads of the sender.  This will cause a bad ground and the gauge will
give
high readings.

        Temp            Ohms
        180     =       105
        210     =       64
        250     =       35
        300     =       18

Graham
