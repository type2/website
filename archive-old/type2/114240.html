Subject: RE: [T2] Insurance Questions

I insure with Geico and I've been satisfied with them.  I actually carry
comprehensive (the won't give me collision) on my bus.  As long as it is
parked it is covered.  I had my agent on the phone check both the NADA and
Blue book values and they said that the would cover it for that and it only
cost me another $18 per quarter over just the basic coverage that I had.
They are a little expensive to insure compared to other vehicles, and rates
will vary greatly based on where you live and your driving record.  I was
also asked if I wanted to insure mine.
