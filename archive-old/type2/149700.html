Subject: Re: [T2] bn4, bn6

Scott,

This is the one thing I don't remember.  Where did the control cable route?  
I know the knob mounted near the driver's feet, but I don't remember how it 
routed to the heater itself.  Do you have any pics of an installation?

The BN4 is not difficult to install and does not rely on any of the exhaust
air heating system to work. Installing a BA6 in a bus that did not come with
one would be a big job.

I have installed Bn4's in late baywindows and it takes about 8 hours give or
take to do a good job. Another few hours to test and make sure it is set up
right - bench setup is recommended. Installing the intake air duct takes a
while, running the control cable is a pain, running the wiring harness is a
pain, there is a lot of taking apart and putting back to do it right. But it
is just work, not rocket science. It helps to have a donor bus that the
heater came out of, and the VW fresh air heater manual is a must.
