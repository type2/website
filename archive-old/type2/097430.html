Subject: Re: [T2] Vent system mystery

 The 'vent' system is fresh air coming thru the vent on the nose between the
turn signals. You operate by moving the blue lever down. The blue one is next
to the 2 red ones to the right of the blank hole in the cluster.

 The fan switch you are turning sounds like you have an air conditioning
system installed in the bus..... another giveaway that you have air
conditioning is the 'radiator looking part'!

 &gt; Any ideas on this one? :-).  When I turn the &quot;Fan&quot; knob to the left to test
&gt; out the vent system, a noise comes from the front that sounds like a
&gt; airplane taking off.  I called the previous owner for a clue and he stated
&gt; that the 4 years he owned the bus, he never fixed it.  The PO before him
&gt; had put in a GM part but he did not know what it was.  The PO said, &quot;Yeah
&gt; the heat and air never did work very well&quot;.  I got the handy work light out
&gt; and went investigating under the front but I'm not sure what I'm looking
&gt; at.  Under the bus there seems to be a &quot;radiator&quot; looking part.  There is a
&gt; similar part under the middle of the bus behind the propane controls.  I
&gt; looked through the Bentley manual and found nothing.  I hope this is not a
&gt; stupid question.  Can anyone give me a clue on where to start or a
&gt; description on what the vent system is supposed to sound like?  Better yet
&gt; anyone have some troubleshooting tips on getting the vent system working?
