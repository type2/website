Subject: vacuum distributor

Hello again:
I'm convinced--when I finally get my new Berg 1689 together, I'm dumping the 
009. I want to go back to the vac distributor, but alas, I've been away too 
long. Can anyone tell me the part number for a vacuum advance distributor 
that will fit a 1600cc dual port running the stock solex pict 34? How about 
a source for said beast? The engine will reside, proudly, in my 70 Westy.
Thanks. Now, how about more onthat orange stool thread... :&gt;
