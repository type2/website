I'm really interested in the engine bay wiring harness for FI engines

&gt; Howdy,
&gt; 
&gt; After countless inquiries for complete wire harnesses we are finally going
&gt; to give it a try. We have a customer looking for a complete harness for a
&gt; '78 bus and we have a fairly complete wire system on a few '78 parts buses
&gt; and we are going to rebuild one. At the same time we will see what it would
&gt; take to remanufacturing them from scratch.
&gt; 
&gt; This is all with out a lot of hind site. We have pulled harnesses many time
&gt; but never careful enough to catalog everything, just bits and pieces. So the
&gt; reason for this email is to encourage anyone to speak up, in anyway.
&gt; Discouragement, encouragement, concerns ext. I have talked to Bob at wire
&gt; works about there products and his feelings on the later bus stuff. It just
&gt; gets to involved he says. He makes '68-'69, '70-'71, and '72 main harnesses
&gt; that we have available now for $140, $153, and $160 respectively.
&gt; 
&gt; Once we have completed this project, shooting for the end of this month, we
&gt; should have a handle on what it would take to remanufacture the '77-'78
&gt; complete harnesses. Hoping for some good feedback.........
