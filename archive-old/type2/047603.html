&gt; Your type 2 does not require high octane. The standard in Europe iscurrently

&gt; I think buses require at least 91 RON. 87 ROZ is probably high enough.

The octane rating requirement on the metal plate under the gas cap on my 1974
Westy specifies

     &quot;Oktan min. 91 ROZ/RON&quot;

The minimum rating applies to stock compression ratios.
