Subject: another heat/part # question

hello again.

i need the parts that connect the heater boxes to the channels on my 
SC. from what i remember of the 73 super beetle i used to have, these 
are a kind of accordian-looking plastic pieces.

does anyone know what i am trying to describe?

i want to search for these parts but am unsure what they are even 
called.

thanks,

Joel Wilson
