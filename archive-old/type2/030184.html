Well now I read it again and the 1'x2' is obviously not inches and he says
hi-lift. Well that may be ideal then.



&gt; I think I saw the same jack at Sam's Club.  The box showed it lifting a
&gt; motorcycle.  It had a level platform about 1' x 2' which looked ideal for
&gt; pulling VW engines.  It was also around $95-$100 and I was also wondering if
&gt; any VW people have tried it.  Thanks.  
&gt; 
&gt; Noticed a new jack at Costco the other day.  It's marketed as being for
&gt; ATV's and golf carts, but it sure looks like it would work well for pulling
&gt; the engine out of a bus or bug.  It's low with two lifting arms, kind of
&gt; like a small high-lift pallet jack.  Have any experienced VW folks seen it,
