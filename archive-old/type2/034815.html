Subject: Re: Three '76 Westy Questions

Dave,
    And the rest of you out there in a similar situation. This is just my 
opinion, and you may not like it, but I would say keep this one as a parts 
vehicle, save your money, and start looking for a better restoration 
candidate. You say you may need one of every replacement panel to fix yours, 
and you want a body shop to do it. Ballpark, this is going to run you around 
7 or 8  THOUSAND dollers, including paint. Plus, you need good solid, clean 
metal to weld a panel to, otherwise it won't hold and your just masking the 
problem. Unless you can learn to weld ( I did to work on mine, took a night 
class) and do most of the work yourself, you're looking at putting far more 
into this vehicle than it will ever be worth. If it's not driveable at this 
time, take some pictures of it and take those to a body shop and get some 
estimates-you'll be shocked. For what you are looking at spending, you'd be 
better off looking for another one. Four years ago I passed on a mint 
condition '79 Westy Deluxe that I could have had for around $4,500.00, 
instead I bought one that needed a lot of work, like yours. I'm now well over 
$4,500.00 &quot;invested&quot; in mine, and it still doesn't look anywhere near as good 
as the '79 I passed up. And, all those weekends I've spent welding, sanding, 
and painting could have been spent kicking back and enjoying the '79. So, you 
see, my advice comes from experience.    Good luck,    Jeff S.
