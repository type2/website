Subject: Subject: Hard start 

What we have here is the dreaded Solex
hot-start-flood. Back in the late 60's I was working
at a VW dealer in Texas. One day a team of Solex
engineers from Germany came in researching this very
problem. They said that it wasn't a problem in
Germany. I guess it's cooler there than in West Texas.
They deduced that the fuel in the accelerator pump
circuit was heating up and expanding during a hot-soak
and dripping out through the accelerator pump
discharge nozzle. Their solution was to drill a tiny
hole, about .033&quot; if I remember correctly, between the
accelerator pump diaphram cavity and the float
chamber. I guess the idea was that the slow build-up
of pressure would relieve itself through the hole but
the hole was too small to keep the accelerator pump
from working. I don't remember if it worked or not. I
do know that every VW I've ever had with the square
carburetor had the same problem.

&gt;When The weather gets hot, the bus is hard to start.
&gt;When I turn the key all the way to start the bus. It
&gt;just keeps trying to start, but it won`t until after
&gt;about five attempts. This only happens when the
&gt;temperature outside is hot or if the bus has been 
&gt;running and the bus is hot. In the morning when the
&gt;temp and bus are cool, the bus starts immediately.
&gt;Any answer will be appreciated
