&gt; There certainly isn't a good enough reason to pull the engine and change
&gt; them.  The main reason not to stack several shims is to lessen the chance
&gt; of oil leaks.  All it takes is one crumb of dirt between any one of the
&gt; spacers to cause a leak.  If you have no leaks there now, then no harm no

we knew that, we polished the surfaces and made sure they were super
clean.  we still would have had to stack the thicker ones because the
right size was out of stock. it just would have been two instead of three.

it doesn't leak so I guess I lucked out.

&gt; foul.  Personally I would pay to have the spacers shipped next day rather
&gt; than take the chance, but that's just me.  I didn't mean to offend you or
&gt; your mechanic.

had already had about 5 next day air shipments for this engine in the
previous two weeks, it is always something,
