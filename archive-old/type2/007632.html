Hey Y'all,
  Today I finnaly drove the 70 Bus home from my parents house where I 
have been doing the work. The first time that I backed up in it, it felt 
werd. It was not smooth it seemed to be clunky. It worked fine in all 
four forwad gears. So it drove it home and it was fine. I tried to drive 
it tonight but it locked up in reverce. I tried to back out of the yard 
and it felt like I had hit a brick wall. I put it in first and it would 
not go. I tried to make it go but it would not work in any gear. I put 
it in neutral and it drove forward, but felt like it was in second or 
third. It will not come out of gear. Any time you try to put it into any 
gear it locks like it is in two gears at once. Is this a lincage 
problem? When the motor was pulled the PO didn't support the trans and 
it droped down(not to the ground just about 6in). Could he have bent the 
shift tube? Or is this an internal problem? I have a trans from a 74 Bus 
that is good, but it looks like the input shaft is longer. I thought it 
wasn't changed until 75? Well could I change the bell housing and the 
input shaft and use this trans or is this to much work. Are the ratios 
the same between the 70 and the 74 Busses? Do I even need to change the 
bell housings. The 74 has the extra mounts that the 70 does not have or 
need. And what about the nose mount, any problems there.
  If this is an internal problem, can I fix this myself? Could this be 
just a problem in the nose cone where all the shift mech is, like the 
hockey stick? I have very little money and need to get this thing fixed. 
If any one has a trans for a 70 that they might want to trade for a 74 
trans or a Bug minus motor or any Bus parts give me a call or E-mail.
  Todd I would really like to hear from you! I may even have to have you 
work on it. My # is below.
