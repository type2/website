Subject: Re: [T2] type 4 oil seal tool

Are you remembering to change your flywheel o-ring? There is a
professional seal installer tool similar to what you describe, but I
have never found it necessary to use one.

&gt; I have tried to fit my flywheel oil seal once already and it is leaking
again. I was wondering can you buy an insert tool like you can for type 1
engines. If not do you think this would work. Getting a large disk of metal
similar is size to the OD of the oil seal, and then drilling holes for the 5
flywheel bolts. You could then push the seal into the case, square to the
crank, by tightening the 5 flywheel bolts.
