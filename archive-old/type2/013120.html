bar oil as an undercoating in the type2 library

This Bar Oil sound as elusive as a squeegee sharpener , left handed
monkey rench, white lead and FuFu juice.

I wouldn't doubt that it's out there somewhere lurking at an oil field
supply, steel distributor or metal stamping plant.

I think I'd look for it at a farm and ranch supply, farmers lubricate a
lot of things others of us can't even name and the fact that it is touted
as a rust preventitive sort of makes me think it's used by farmers for
equipment that must store outside for extended time cycles.
