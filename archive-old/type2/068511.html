Subject: bus security (paranoids exposed)

Hi all,

I am just wondering if anyone has come up with good ideas for locking the 
engine hatch. I sometimes leave my car in some fairly unsavory areas and get 
concerned about all of the goodys in the engine bay that are just sitting 
there ready for the taking (like battery, distributor, coil etc etc). There 
are heaps of expensive items in there that are really easy and quick to take 
out. Not being able to lock it also makes the car very prone to malicious 
attack or prank.
I had to park my car in a particularly bad area one night and used a rope tied 
to the inside of the engine cover, and to the internal access hatch, but it 
was a bit of a pain.

I would also be interested in anyone's ingenious ideas for making the contents 
of their bus more secure. 

Perhaps i am just paranoid....
