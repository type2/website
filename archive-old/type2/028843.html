&gt; I have been trying to get a problem resolved for
&gt; over a month and a half.  After several phone calls of being put on
&gt; ignore and 5 or more email messages,
&gt; I finally had to get the CC co. to dispute the charge to get any one
&gt; to even respond to me.


You know what, this is just about the last straw.

Let's deal with the actual facts here rather than fiction.  Mari mistakenly
told you that an oil pump she was writing him up for was not a Melling. She
was wrong; it was the same Melling that Motorworks and just about everyone
else is shipping.  Honest mistake (and one that she will not make again).
You INSTANTLY griped about it publicly to the Type 2 list. (Not &quot;over a
month and a half&quot; ago, but 3 weeks ago. I have the dated email.)   You then
emailed us to say that you wanted to return it.  NO PROBLEM!   Jerry
apologized for the error, instructed you to return the pump, and offered not
only to refund your full purchase price but ALSO to reimburse standard US
mail rates for your return postage expense. And indeed you did send it back.

My store manager, Dan, also followed up personally with a phone call, at my
request, and left you a message to return his call. You confirmed having
gotten his message in a later email, but instead of returning his call you
threatened to contest the charges on your card - why I don't know, since, by
your own account, we had ALREADY offered you you not just a full refund but
ALSO reimbursement for standard return postage!  Dan once again left you a
message just yesterday.  Yet today you are again griping.  Seems we are
being more than fair in handling the return.   We immediately agreed to take
back the part, issue a full refund, and reimburse return postage.   I don't
know what more you could possibly want.

I would be more than happy to forward to the list absolute incontrovertable
proof of the above, which I have in the form of Steve's own emails from his
own computer. But I hardly think this is the appropriate forum.

This is really getting ridiculous.  Someone else who bitched during this
free-for-all complained that he called and could not get an answer on
whether he order had shipped.  It was because he called the orders-only
line, so they indeed could not answer his question, instead referring him to
the correct number. When I POLITELY explained this, he responded by calling
me a jackass.

Look.  All I am is an bus enthusiast and small business owner, running an
honest business, trying to provide a good product to people at a good price.
Many people on this list have been buying from me for years, and probably
could not have afforded to keep their bus were it not for the money I've
saved them and the quality parts I've provided.  I've helped many people out
of serious jams and gotten them parts they desparately needed that nobody
else had - at cheap prices no less. I've gone out of my way to find vintage
NOS parts that nobody else took the time to track down, and then passed them
on at cheap prices. I've been an active contributor to this list for years -
since long before it even existed as such, when there were so few of us that
the Type 2 list, Vintage Bus list, and Vanagon List were all just one
combined list with a few hundred members in total.

I can take a jab once in a while, and I sure as heck deserve one sometimes.
Being human,  I screw up as often as anybody else does.  But it's getting to
the point that now I'm putting up with half-truths, outright lies, and even
personal insults.  You know what, I've had it.  I grew the Bus Depot out of
my hobby to help out fellow bus owners with parts. It used to be fun. I
always said when it stopped being fun, I'd stop doing it.  I'm about one
gray hair away from turning my focus away from pre-1980 parts, focusing on
Vanagon parts (which are much more lucrative anyway, and a lot less hassle
since they don't go on backorder as often and I don't have to go to the ends
of the earth to find them), unsubscribing, and eliminating the Type 2 list
discount.  I never thought I'd feel this way in a million years. I always
felt that there was somewhat of a common bond among us bus owners.  I always
told my wife that I felt that bus owners as a rule tended to be a very &quot;down
to earth&quot; group of people, generally honest and well intentioned, a little
less &quot;mean spirited&quot; and self-serving than people I'd come across in other
walks of life.  People who took life a little slower, even, kind of like
their busses.  In other words, the type of people I wanted to deal with day
in and day out.  It was one of the main reasons I started the Depot. From
where I'm sitting right now it just doesn't feel that way anymore.  Maybe
the scene has degenerated, or maybe I'm just letting a small but vocal
minority get under my skin, I don't know.

Nobody is forcing you to buy from The Bus Depot.  Please, go buy your parts
somewhere else.
