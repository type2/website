 Unknown. I asked Vincent and he told me that they couldn't get a
description from VW when they were researching their m-code book.

I wonder if it means European Delivery?  Like what Mercedes does:  You order a US spec MB and plan on a
vacation in Europe. You arrive and go to the factory and pick up your car on a preset date. Then drive your MB
around and drop it off at a predetemined port and fly back to the US. The car gets shipped to the nearest VPC
[vehicle preparation center] and then sent his nearest dealer.
