First, Where are you?  Cold in Mexico is a different cold than in Northern
Europe.  8^)

Second, if you have a single carb with four intake runners to the cylinders,
it's probably a common aftermarket change - a weber progressive (was on the
Ford Pinto) and your problem is likely to be carb icing. Take a look in the
archives for various solutions;  unfortunately, none of them are simple but
the problem can be addressed.

Third, no idea about your original problem that had them replace your
engine.  No bang, no loud expensive noises?  (Listen to the Muir Sounds
page;
http://www.volks_dot_net/sounds/muir/index.htm
for an idea of what I'm talking about.)

Fourth,  Congrats and welcome.  This list and type2_dot_com are great resources
and it bears repeating:  Thank you again to the admins and others who keep
it running.

Subject: [T2] '78 bus


&gt; HelloSorry about the first mail. That was an accident. I am a 20 yr old
guy who just got his first bus a few months ago. a few weeks ago driving
home from work. it just cut off and wouldn't start or turn over. so i had to
have it towed to the local VW shop. the guy took a wrench and tried turning
the alternator i believe or something connected to the motor that he said he
should be able to turn by hand. so i had to get the motor replaced. now i
can't get my van to accelerate right. everytime i go back they adjust the
choke. the problem i'm having is when i step on the pedal, if i don't step
very slowly it will cut off, especially when cold. if it is warmed up it is
a lil better but still just kinda pauses for a good while before it gets up
and gets going. this isn't good when i'm pulling out and it is cutting off
on me in the middle of intersections. i'm scared to drive the thing. i know
when it is cold it affects the van, but prior to my motor locking up. i
could just jump !
&gt; in and hit the gas and go no matter wha
&gt; t. we had ice here and it still was never this bad. also i found out when
the motor was replaced, that my van has a ford carb on it. any suggestions?
should i have the carb replaced. try setting the choke back to the way it
was prior to the new motor? sorry for the long message. any suggestions or
insights would be much appreciated.
