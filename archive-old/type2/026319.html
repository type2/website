Subject: Inspecting coil?
Message-ID: &lt;C51ED84B6F47D211917A0000F8BCBD1101EFB793_at_zcard00g_dot_ca.nortel_dot_com&gt;

So WRT this DM method - How do I inspect an ignition coil to measure how
worn out it is?
Same question for a condenser?

Now for the real question -  My van is starting to make an periodic sharp
clunk sound  from the back 
occasionally when I back up slowly.
I'm assuming this would be the CV joints? No noticable noise, or problems
going forward.
