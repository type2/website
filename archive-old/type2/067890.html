that there's an internal fuse... basically a very fine wire.  It apparently
blows quite easily, leaving very little trace that it ever existed.  I
soldered a wire in its place to effect the repair.

        A little bit of clock trivia:  in 1971 (month/year is stamped on
the back of the clock), they went to a transistorized clock with a little
rotational electromagnetic oscillator.  These have metal covers on the
back.  The earlier mechanical ones that I have use a plastic cover.  Kind
of funny:  going from plastic to metal.  Would have expected the reverse.
