Subject: Re: [T2] The Guac's First Trip

Hold it---

I missed something in Grimm's Fairy Tale land.

Act #1 I thought it went something like this;

DT bought the Great White Whale off E-Bay---

It needed help.

The landlord was pissed because DT had too many rides in the lot.

DT looked for a parking spot or someone to buy the Whale--no Denaro's to
rent a spot to put it.

DT chops off the roof, gives it away, so it will fit into his garage so
he can get with the resto work, and finds terminal cancer on the roof.

Woe is DT.

Now----Act #2

DT winds up with La Cucaracha Guacmobile out of the clear blue, and is
hearing, feeling some engine irregularities.

He thinks it's a vacuum line maybe.

What did I miss during the intermission when I went for the JuJubee's &amp;
Good &amp; Plenties??

Did some goose lay the Golden Egg?
Did Goldfinger drop a brick off direct from Ft. Knox KY ?
Did his rich Uncle in Hong Kong will him a load of dracma's?
Did he hit the Multi State Lotto?
Did he meet Bonnie and Clyde Barrow on the side of the road?

Something happened here real quick, and I missed the plot.

Someone fill me in.

I hate starting back into a picture when I missed something interesting.
