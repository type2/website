Subject: Thanks!

Just a big &quot;thank you&quot; to all the list folk who answered my guage placement
and wiring questions. As of tonight they are in and functioning. A 14 mile
round trip to town shows them to be lit up and registering. Now I'll start
the process of recording the readings to establish a baseline for my bus.

Thanks again for all the help. You folks are the best.

Regards,
Dave
