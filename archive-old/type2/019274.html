Subject: I guess I didn't explain this right!

thanks to all who replied to my cold start valve question.  The only
thing is, and I guess it is my fault because I didn't word it correctly,
the running funny problem was present BEFORE I changed the oil, it
didn't just show up after I changed it.  Someone had mentioned a
diagnotic test to see if it is the cold start valve; my husband said
disconnect it and see if it runs worse with it disconnected, is this
valid?  thanks!  Beth and the '78 Hippychickmobile in NJ
