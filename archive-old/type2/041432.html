Subject: 71 Westy and thank you..and....brake servo

OK Libba is back to her old self( thanks for all the help on the mis firing) 
for the most part I've driven her around town and the highway to make sure 
she's road ready (letting my 99 NB Turbo rest) for my trip to Gathering of 
The Vibes the 23rd. It must have been some crap in the carb a few jets 
weren't showing sunlight. The only weird thing is before she's fully up to 
temp and I step on the brake it cuts out, when warm I step on the brake she 
speeds up, I do think thought that the brake servo is going because I can 
hear air going through when I step on brake..stops fine though...new M 
cylinder, hoses, calipers, wheel cylinders  and vacuum valve near engine. 
Will my brake servo fail me miserably at some point, like down a steep hill 
or will I still have enough breaks to stop?
