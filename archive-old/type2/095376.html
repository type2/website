Subject: new brake pads won't go in

Newbie and not ashamed to admit it or ask for help, thanks in advance.

What are some tricks to getting new pads in?  There seems no way except to 
maybe pound them in.  Bentley shows a tool to moving the brake pistons(?) 
all the way back, and mine are barely sticking out but can't get them all 
the way in.

Maybe the pads I got are not correct and are too thick?  Do I file down the 
pads?

Thanks,
Daniel
