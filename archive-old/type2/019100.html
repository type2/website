I have an 81 Vanagon that I must 
sell. The engine is out and torn
down. It needs a rebuild. The FI
gear should be &quot;ok&quot;, but one of the 
injectors melted, so obviously it's
not ready to run.

I also have various tidbits from
an 81 Westy interior that I was
going to install in the van.

If anyone needs anything, let 
me know. I can take some digital
images of parts or whatever as
requested.

I'm in Iowa City, Iowa. Van
is in my garage.

thanks all

matt
