Subject: Wanted - Shelf for Westy
Message-ID: &lt;0.5a7f6f67.255a3b68_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Dear Volks,

My new '75 Westy has a metal box type of cover at the back over the rear 
hinges.  I've seen a structure with a wooden shelf in the same place in some 
deluxe Westy's.  Mine Westy does not have a side cabinet so this metal box 
goes completely from one side to the other.  Does anyone have a shelf 
available?  If so please pmail me.

Thanks, David Hunt
