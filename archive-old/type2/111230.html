Subject: #1-2 Cyl not firing !! Well they are now, my bus is on the road
  again !!

as much as i hate to admit it, my #1 -#2 cyl. wires
were crossed.

this i should have checked, but i was so certain after
putting the motor back together and in the bus that
everything was perfect. WRONG !

I crossed over the wires just for fun and, WHAM she
purrs like a kitten..

of course i then let the motor warm by driving it in
105F temp. in california for a moment, then i adjusted
the carb a little, man o man am i excited..

i took her on the freeway and she just moseys right
along, of course i dont know how fast i was going in
the slow lane (lack of speedo cable), but im assuming
a steady 60-65..

of course i need to fine tune alot of things now,
brakes, and electrical.

but man this bus rocks, its my first one and ive
driven it only about 8 miles so far but I LOVE IT&gt;.

what a blast to drive around in my little &quot;cream
puff&quot;..

my bus is all sanded down, spot glazed, a little bondo
here and there, and your typical rust on pass. front
windshield. but looks like she might be ready for
paint next week..

any surface rust that may have been on body i ground
down to the metal, any suggestions on a metal prep
conditioner to keep the minor surface rust from
re-appearing??

i want to thank those that had the oddasity to tell me
that i may have crossed the wires during my engine
drop, torque and cleanup madness..
you guys rock..

peace,
rob '70 bus 'cream puff'
