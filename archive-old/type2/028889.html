Subject: RE: [T2] Looking for: bottom tins for 1800 engine

Robert,

These tin are often missing. One reason is because people take them off and
never put them on again. Another and most often is that they become loose
and the screw wholes wallow out and they simply fall off. Fortunately we
here at BUStedBUS_dot_com have and sell these parts used. The two pieces you
need, the lower left and right heat channels sell for $29.99. We first
insure that they are not broken and that the screw wholes are not wallowed
out, we then clean, sandblast and paint them with a high temp. semi-flat
black paint. These are available to order on line or you can always call to
place an order. Please see our hours bellow. Thanks,

Joe Mitchell

Subject: [T2] Looking for: bottom tins for 1800 engine


Hi all,
I'm desperately looking for the 2 bottom engine tins for the 1800cc Type IV
engine.  They are the ones underneath the engine, on either side of the
case, that cover up the pushrod tubes and direct the air flow.  For some
reason, they are missing on the engine I just rebuilt, and I'd like to put
some on, both to protect the pushrod tubes etc., but also to ensure that the
thermostat I installed works well.
I'm hoping one of you have a pair of these tins to sell to me for a
reasonable price.
Regards,
  --Robert
