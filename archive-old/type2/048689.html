Hello Everyone:

I'd like to put a glass sunroof over the cab area of my bus.  I remember that JCWhitney used to carry one, but they don't any more.  Does anyone know of a source for glass sunroofs that will fit the roof contour of a VW bus??  The fact that the roof has such a rounded shape is making it difficult to find one.

Thanks!!
