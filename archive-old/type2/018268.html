         What you are talking about is non-detergent oil, which is
readily available, at least at places like Fleet-Farm.
         Whether or not that is the best idea or not, I'm not sure.
Sounds reasonable. OTOH, I wouldn't dream of running a T1 engine without
adding a high-pressure pump, a big external oil cooler, and -- of course
-- a filter.
