Subject: Questions before buying new cam

I'm about to buy a new cam for my 78 2000cc engine I'm rebuilding.
According to Bently and Muir I need to check the inner face of the cam
gear for pitch radius departure numbers +/- 1,2,3 etc. Having checked
the gear I have found no such marking. So I looked at the gear on a cam
from a 75 1800cc engine and found no such number? Does this pitch radius
marking only apply to type 1 engines? Am I not looking in the right
place? Help me please! I want to get the right part the first time.

The only number I could find on the 2000cc hydraulic cam gear is 021 109
111C followed by the VW logo, then 8H. What does the 8H mean? The gear
is riveted to the cam, can it be removed and installed on a new cam?

Been shoping the net for a new stock cam. (the old one is in bad shape)
None of the catalogs say anything about ordering the cam with any
optional gears, just the one that comes with it. I don't know? Haven't
called any dealers yet. I also noticed that most of the well known
dealers have about the same prices for the stock grind hyd. cam but no
one is advertising the manufacturers names. Does anyone sell genuine VW
cams? I did notice that European Motorworks (magazine ad) was much
cheaper than the most discussed parts dealers on the list. Has anyone
ever dealt with these guys? There price is about half of average but I
don't want a &quot;peanut-butter&quot; cam. I want the real deal. Are these guys
reputable?

Once again, thanks so much for the help!
Tom
