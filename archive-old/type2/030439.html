Hello, all!

Well, as Ken Said, last night he got me lickered up and put to bed.  Of
course, this morning the bus would not start :-( So we spent the day doing
diagnosis and this afternoon cleaned the terminals on the starter and off
it went :-)  I am strenuously resisting his suggestions concerning
carbs...  Nothing against him, but I a pretty strong fan of FI and want
want to keep it in the worst way (so far, of course this *has* been the
way I have been keeping it :-)

I am intent on heading west from here tonight and will be going over I-40
to Albuqueque, NM and then heading NW thru Chaco Canyon (do a search on
this to see why :-) and Hoevenwoep to Salt Lake City, Steve Blackham, and
my brother's house.  Remember, you are looking for a cream coloured '80
Westy, now with list stickers! (thanks to Ken and Richard Palmer :-)
