Re Jeff's cracking of head due to misaligned pushrod tube....
I guess I was lucky- last week I did two lifter replacements, and upon
reassembly, turned it over, and heard terrible &quot;PING&quot; like a valve had
snapped or something....pulled the valve cover, notices tons of play on one
of the rockers and feared the worst, but, was a case of pushrod not seating
on rocker- went back in ok, and runs fine; went up the Vermont from NJ and
back fine.  I usually do check rod to rocker placment, but probably popped
out upon tightening nuts on rockers.
