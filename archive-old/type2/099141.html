Subject: Re: [T2] Upgrading to H4s

I put in the H4's ,, with a slight modification,, I drilled the back of the lamp
holder to accept the same bulb that the marker light uses,, mounted using a
rubber grommet.
Now I have daytime running lights 
they are like the early beetle, and bus, with the separate bulb
I believe this is a euro thing,, as a bus I owned once had this style in it,
along with KMs dash and recoil seat belts.  No my 74 has the Km's dash, and the
recoil seat belts as well as the H4's with the day time running headlights.

I didn't use a relay ,, as I have the 55/65 bulbs
I didn't find it too much of a hassle,, and I kinda enjoy having the dim daytime
headlights 

YMMV

&gt; &gt; This seems like allot of effort to get a little brighter light. I am not
&gt; &gt; convinced that the line lose and the switch connection would be sufficient
&gt; &gt; enough to really make a difference. I could be mistaken. 
&gt; 
&gt; I just got back from the left coast and had a rental while out there, and
&gt; the fact that I was only doing 55 and had powerfull high beams was the
&gt; only thing that gave me the time to avoid the deer in my lane of the
&gt; highway.........sorry give me as much light as I can get without
&gt; blinding the guy coming the other way, and high beams that will cut the
&gt; night to the next county......
&gt; 
&gt; this is an interesting thread as I was considering the h4 mod before the
&gt; deer incident
