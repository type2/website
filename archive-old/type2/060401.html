Subject: 80-83 Westy Exhaust Questions

I am looking at a 80-83 Westy and noticed that some of the exhaust piping to the heat exchanger/heater box is missing.  Will this effect emisions or the proper running of the engine.  Also, is there still a recall for 80-83 Vanagon exhaust and if so who do I call/email to get the info.  Thanks
