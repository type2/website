Subject: brake fluid brands

Hello,
I am planning on flushing my brake fluid this weekend and
was wondering if there is any difference in brand names
of brake fluid.
I know I need DOT 3 but besides that I cant decide what to get.
Would it be wise to go with something well know on this or
get what ever is on sale at my local FLAPS?
Any opinions welcomed, such as what not to buy and whats good.


thanks
Alex,
