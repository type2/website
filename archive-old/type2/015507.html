&gt;Because of the my suggestion that I wanted to see if people think it is OK
&gt;to get CD-ROM or ZIP copies of the archives...

A hell of a great reference of good and reasonable value that can generate
revenue to pay for the cost of the server, etal, and at the same time save
some on the cost of instant free access. Everything of value takes
time/money to create. Those who want/demand value at no cost have a very
warped sence of values. 

I'd consider it an absolute bargain to have the whole archive on CD rom/s
for $20+ shipping if it all actually fit on one CD. It would be so much
more convienient than waiting on the server while on line. 

&gt;
&gt;Ken Hooper, one of the Type2 admins,  has told me to take down my archives
&gt;of the Type2 list.
&gt;
&gt;I don't fully understand his reasons, but I understand what he is asking.
&gt;So I will be taking down the archives.
&gt;
&gt;I'm glad all my hard work was a waste of time.  Including my discussions
&gt;with Ken.

Not a waste at all if you recoup some of your investment from those who
know value when they see it.
