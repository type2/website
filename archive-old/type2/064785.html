Ladies, Gentlemen (and the rest of you, too),

Fun is fun, but it's not Friday *yet*!  STARTING FLUID IS VERY DANGEROUS!!
If you spray it around your engine compartment at random, you are setting
yourself up for a closed casket funeral, forget what the bus will look
like.  Starting fluid is composed mostly of Methyl Ether, which has a
flash point just slightly above room temperature.  I would *highly* advise
that you never let anyone near your bus with the stuff.  I have used it,
but only on lawnmowers, V-8's and other open air applications, and then
only with a helper standing by with a fire extinguisher. (BTW, that fire
extinguisher was only for piece of mind, explosions happen way too fast
even for halon)  In the enclosed engine compartment of a bus, you are way
too likely to build an inadvertant fuel/air bomb, which can blow you right
the f*&amp;k away!  DON'T DO THIS!!!!!

Also BTW, on a slightly calmer note, for those of you who are off in
search of vacuum leaks, the propane will raise your RPM's, all the others
mentioned (EXCEPT THE DAMNED STARTING FLUID!!) will *drop* your RPM's.  So
if you spray carb cleaner at your intake manifold, and expect a rise in
RPM's, you ain't gonna get it.

I am fairly strongly of the opinion that this is a job best left to pro's.
The only safe way I know of to do a vacuum leak test at home involves a
series of measurements, starting when the car is new to establish a
baseline figure (yeah, right, like we *know* anyone who has owned a *new*
aircooled VW bus), with the ol' vacuum guage.  Once you have established a
base line, further readings will tell you all sorts of things.

Using 15psi as a baseline (a usual reading from a new car {anyone got a VW
specific new engine reading???? [really, REALLY!  trolling here, as I want
to know too]}), over the life of the engine it will drop to about 10 psi
as the rings wear out, but will quickly drop to ~9psi and dancing if you
burn/drop a valve.  If it is less than 11 psi and steady on a new engine
or less than 9 psi on an older engine, you have a vacuum leak sure as
shootin'.  Removing and sealing the various accesories will tell you which
one.

Ignoring a vacuum leak is VERY BAD for your engine, as you will be running
it *way* too lean, which will burn that sucker up quicker than faster!
This applies to *all* engines, VW and otherwise, FI'ed and otherwise.

Of all the accesories, oil temp guage, head temp guage, oil pressure
guage, etc. that I have heard mentioned on this and the Vanagon list, I
regard a vacuum guage as the most generally indicative of engine health.
I have kind of been waiting for an opportunity to mention it, but was
waiting for someone eles to start it.  Am I the only person to slap a
vacuum guage on my engine at regular intervals?????
