&gt; The DEQ used to have a grandfather law where anything over 20 years
&gt; old was grandfathered and didn't have to pass DEQ.  I guess somebody
&gt; didn't like that, because they suspended it.  They drew a line in
&gt; the sand, more or less, and now say that if you are in Portland area
&gt; and have a vehicle from 75 or earlier, you don't have to have it
&gt; tested.

yeah I missed too, in Maryland it is 77 or newer, and I have a 78

&gt; of the long lines of later cars.  All those folks had been waiting
&gt; much longer than me, but I got to go by them because the test for a
&gt; 76 anything isn't nearly as rigorous.  I pulled right up to a bay
&gt; that was empty and waited for a tech.

they usually still make me wait in line....

&gt; tech that it is a 76 bus.  Her next question had my jaw falling
&gt; open.  &quot; Yes, but what make? who made it?&quot;......    W    H     A
&gt; T??????
&gt;
&gt;  I politely gave her the info on the car.  I couldn't believe it.
&gt; Turns out that she had been working there for 6 months and had never
&gt; tested a VW bus before.  Evidentally, she grew up in a hole
&gt; somewhere because she didn't know what a VW Bus was.  Then came the
&gt; best part,...  &quot;Where is the radiator?&quot;.  LMAO!

in my case the computer keeps rejecting the bus because Volkswagen failed
to put enough digits in the VIN for it to go thru...a supervisor always
has to come over and insert a key and bypass that section....not sure why
but thats what they tell me, not enough digits in the serial number

&gt; Give it a shot first.  You don't have to pay them anything if you
&gt; don't pass DEQ.  You will if you do.  Or you could just live outside

sheesh in Maryland you pay first and then they test, if you fail you get
one free retest then you pay again. and again and again...etc
