I had the same problem as well as the front of the bus lurching forward. I
used what was readily available: 4x8x2&quot; brick pavers from the flower garden.
I put the bricks in front of the tire as a kinda wedge or chock(behind if
you are working on the right drum) and that kept the tire from spinning.

I did bend my 3/4&quot; Craftsman sliding T bar  with the 5' sewer pipe but it is
still usable :)
