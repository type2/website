&gt; Cruising the net the other day I found the GoWesty Store.
&gt; There I found the wraparound seat pedestal pair of rubber things for 29.95! 10 bucks less than Wolfsburg, their supplier. I think it was a return or something, but I ordered friday, had them yesterday, and they are perfect.
&gt; Good service from some central california coast folks (los osos).
&gt; Just wanted to give them a thumbs up on this one.
&gt; 
&gt; Now....What kind of glue to put them on?
&gt; I have repainted my seat pedestals with the rattle can. Will anything stick the rubber to them now?

I am sure there is something made for that purpose but I would use
Pliobond, use with plenty of fresh air, flying is for aircraft...
