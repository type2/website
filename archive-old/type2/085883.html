Subject: Distinguishing 71 &amp; 73 calipers

I just purchased a pair of NOS ATE calipers for my 71 Bus.  The seller =
assured me that the ATE part number (13.2541-5260.2) corresponded to the =
correct VW number (211 615 107).  I now have these in my hot little =
hands and am looking at them and suspect that they are the later 73 =
calipers.  Does someone know the width of the opening on the outside of =
the caliper for a 71 Bus so that I could compare?  Or is there some =
other way to tell which ones I have?
Thanks again.
Hal Landvoigt
