Subject: '76 Westy for sale in San Francisco

No, not mine :-)

This is an orange '76 Westy I've seen frequently in the Glen Park 
neighborhood of San Francisco.  Was driving home from a friend's house 
tonight and saw the for sale sign and figured I'd post about it here.

Sign says 135K miles, new tires, CD player.  No price listed.  415 234 
2290.

This bus looks to be in great shape on the exterior.  Some minor rust 
in the usual places.  I've walked by it a number of times while in that 
neighborhood, and the body has always looked very straight to my eyes.  
IIRC it's a non-deluxe ... no stove, sink only.

Anyway, hopefully someone can pick up a good deal on a nice bus.
