Subject: Fuel Smell

I have a 79 2.0-L fuel injection Bus with a BN6 heater, and yesterday I 
smelled gas when I was driving inside the vehicle.  I would smell it more 
when the heat vents were on, but not at all when the BN6 heater was on.

I would guess I need to check all the fuel lines for leaks.  Are there a lot 
of fuel lines to check, and should I check other things?

Thanks
Bo
