 I started thinking about the fuel pump harness again. I talked to Mark
 Dearing about it today nope no fuse there, I had asked Richard Atwell the
 other day about it I was still confused and I could not find one, Scott
 Lyons sent word that there wasn't one there in the circuit from his memory,
 and many many others have offered their help and advice.

You have to have the fuse. It is the key-on power to the double relay. It is talked about
here:  http://www.conservatory_dot_com/vw/manuals_nyx/Images/FeulInjection/L-Jetronic/LJET-22.GIF  in the 1st
section. Except it does not go to 88y!

It is a black wire that goes to the + side of the coil and feeds 86c of the relay.

Got a 68-79 Bentley? Look at the 77/78 wiring diagram. Look for 65 66 67 along the bottom on the right side.
You will see the coil pictured. Go straight up to N. See the little 15? See the black
wire going to the right? See it go to S21? THAT is the in-line fuse for the backup lights. From there
the black wire goes up and to the right and ends at the double relay.

If all that wiring is missing, then you need to reinstall it. Find 86c on the double relay and see what is in
the wire plastic block. It is probably cut off. Here is the plug arrangement:

Section b has 86c in it.

Test, test, test...... it has to be there.
