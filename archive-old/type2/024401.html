Subject: [T2] re:tent poles and anyone in Portland Oregon

&gt;On this page it has a listing that says for tent parts send a check or MO
to
&gt;Hirsch Weis tent frame parts at 5203 S. E. Johnson Creek Blvd.  Portland
&gt;Oregon.  I have searched in yellow pages on the net and for  a webpage.
Would
&gt;any one in Portland know if this company is still in business? Maybe under
&gt;another name?


I can find no listing for Hirsch Weis. Also no tent company at this address
in the Yellow Pages. I've driven down that road many times and have never
seen a tent distributor. I can tell you that White Stag is out of business.
They were once a big local sporting goods and apparel manufacturer. You can
still see their large old neon sign when crossing the Burnside Bridge into
downtown Portland. Hope this helps.
