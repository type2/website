Subject: gas prices

Gentlepersons-
                       I'm sure most of the Bus owners have been hit hard by 
the price increase in gas...Well, Science/Metaphysics has come to our rescue! 
Just go to
&lt;http://www.layo_dot_com&gt; and peruse at your leisure. Afterwards, just think how 
cheap
it will be to drive across some bridges that are also for sale...
