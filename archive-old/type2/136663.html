Subject: RE: [T2] Nut size on fan end of generator

&gt; BTW, I recently researched the swap of an alternator into the generator's
&gt; position. B In addition tot he different base, there has been comments on
the
&gt; standard carb linkage getting in the way, and on shifting the mechanical
&gt; fuel pump some 15 degrees or so to may room for the fatter alternator.

The 34PICT3 accel pump linkage conflict with a new Bosch alternator is no big
deal *IF* someone shows you how to do it!

You just need to turn a piece around so it looks like this:

Vendors, PLEASE feel free to include these pictures with your alternator
conversion kits.  Listmembers, please feel free to post and/or distribute
these photos as you see fit.

You probably do need the different stand &amp; back plate, which come with the
alternator conversion kit from Bus Depot &amp; probably other vendors too.

p.s. My '71's mechanical fuel pump doesn't conflict with the alternator in any
way.  Never even considered it!  Maybe it's a problem with different years?
