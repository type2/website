&gt; &gt; &gt; well for a little more stability and better
&gt; (IMO) handling you could 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 205/70R14 tires...they are almost identical
&gt; in outside diameter to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; stock 185/14 tires that are stock.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; One other thing to think about is that early
&gt; bays have the worm-and-
&gt; &gt; peg steering box that is weaker than the
&gt; later worm-and-roller box.  
&gt; 
&gt; but Bentley says  that the worm and peg is
&gt; bigger and stronger than the
&gt; previous units starting in 1968  
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, the two boxes do not
&gt; interchange.  My theory is that 
&gt; &gt; the increased steering effort of the radial
&gt; tires over the original 
&gt; &gt; narrow bias ply tires caused more steering
&gt; box failures, prompting the 
&gt; &gt; change.  For this reason, I've resisted the
&gt; urge to go to wider tires 
&gt; &gt; on my '71.  If you do make the switch, make
&gt; sure you are moving before 
&gt; &gt; steering to reduce stress on the peg.
&gt; 
&gt; I have not noticed significant differences
&gt; between the 185 and 205 tires,
&gt; but it has been a long time since I used the
&gt; narrow tires
&gt; 
My only concern is that I'm not aware of any
205's that have sufficient max pressure or max
load, since the Michelin MXT's left the market.
Remember that any of the P rated 205/75/14, which
is all of them to my knowledge, must have the max
load reduced to 91% to compare it to the spec
185R14C or 185R14Rf.  In other words the tire
should still have max pressure of at least 45 and
a max load in the 1700 range and load index of
94-95. I don't know of any close to this.
