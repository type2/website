[...] Hmmm... having trouble getting this posted...

I would appreciate if you could check the offset.

Back to my original problem - getting identical wheels on all fours with 15&quot;
or greater diameter. I think I'll need to put the 5X205mm---&gt; 5X112mm
adapter on the rear, which will give me 5X112mm all around.

Now I need to what's the added offset of the 5X205---&gt; 5X112mm adapter?

Hmmm... come to think of it, is there an adapter to make the front 5X112mm
accept a 5X205mm wheel? That would allow me a straight pre-1968 bus 15&quot;
wheel, eh?

Confused still...

&gt;  Yup, but the offset's different! (ISTR about 23mm, but I can check,
&gt; if anyone wants me to. It's stamped on the outside of the (later)
&gt; wheels, behind the plastic hubcap thingy.
