Subject: For Sale 78 Westy $2000

Hello list!
I am sad to say, that it is time to sell my 1978
Westy. It is very reliable, but needs some minor work.
I bought it two years ago, and did a compression check
at that time. The engine is strong, about 125 lbs in
each cylinder. It only has approximately 138000
original miles on it. 
It needs a seal for the pop top. The canvas has a
small hole in it. The bed on top is in good condition.
the fold down bed in the back works well.
The fridge works, as well as the burners on the stove.
The sink pump is not hooked up, so I have no idea if
it works. It has the camping stool, but no child's
cot.(missing when I bought it, but the anchors are
still there.)
I did the front brakes, and the clutch was rebuilt
about a year ago. It is the 2.0L engine with hydraulic
lifters. (no valve adjustments necessary.) The pushrod
tubes leak oil, as well as the oil cooler.
I am not saying she is perfect, but with very little
work, she would be a great camper!
The body is almost perfect, the previous owner backed
into something, and there is a small dent in the left
rear behind the bumper.
By the way, It has a great heater, no worry about
fogging up windows!
The interior is real nice, and still has the bug
screen for the back, as well as the front curtain.
I could go on about this, but if you are interested,
personal e-mail me at santori1_at_cs_dot_com for more info.
It is a steal at $2000.
Thank you.

Matthew Santori
