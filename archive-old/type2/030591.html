        I second this.  I go to school up there (Belmont == Bay Area, Menlo 
Park, etc.)  and I've called them up nmumerous times with questions and they are
always happy to help.  They have a good selection.  My .02,

since, go figure.  I highly recommend dealing with these guys if possible.  Of 
course standard disclaimers apply, I am just a satisfied customer.  The place I 
speak of is:
     
DONSCO 
140 Harbor Blvd.
Belmont, CA 94002
(415)592-1131
     
Their ad in the Yellow pages says &quot;DISCOUNT VW PARTS, Specializing in all 
air-cooled VW's &amp; early water-cooled VW's.  Restoration or modification.  Large 
diplay area.  Friendly, knowledgeable service.  MON-FRI 9-6, SAT 9-3&quot;
     
I have always found their prices to be very competitive and their service both 
friendly and knowledgeable (just like the ad).
     
     
Good luck,
terry
     
BTW, they said they probably could no longer get the 6V relay kit :(.
Maybe we can get the Bus Boys to start stocking this item, maybe even the 6V 
version!
     
peace

Yo, all!
     
Since we seem to be about to start another round of no-start stories, let 
me do my best to cut to the chase.  Yes, St. Muir's ford solenoid trick 
works.  GM, Chrysler, and (probably) Fiat have made similar starter relays 
at one time or another. In addition and finally, Mr. Robert Bosch awoke one 
fine morning and found that the tooth fairy had left something closely 
resembling a clue under his pillow.  Marching his rear down to the shop, he 
must have handed it off to his engineers with the question, &quot;Why can't we 
make something like this that is elegant, requires no cutting of wires and 
minimal drilling into the body of those old busses?&quot;
     
The end result of this process is something called the &quot;Bosch WR-1 kit&quot;. It 
comes with a relay, all the correct conectors, a detailed instruction 
sheet, and is fused _at_ 15 amps.  You need only drill one hole in your 
precious bus for a sheet metal screw to suspend the sucker and ground it. 
This solution was proposed first by some (unknown, but applauded) other 
list member back a bit.  As my bus has been a notorious non-starter, I went 
down and tried to find it.  The perversity of nature dictates that such an 
incredibly useful item be impossible to find, and indeed this is true.  The 
WR-1 kit is only ever mentioned in a footnote in the starter section of the 
Bosch master catalog :-( Getting your standard issue parts-dweeb to 
actually find the entry, not to mention acquire one is nigh on to 
impossible.  Fortunately, y'all may take advantage of the multiple phone 
calls I made to innumerable FLAPS and to Robert Bosch, USA and find the 
damned thing almost immediately by calling the following Company:
     
Olympic Auto Parts
5168 Eisenhower Avenue
Alexandria, VA  22304
Tel. - (703) 370-0850
     
Once you have reached this august assemblage of parts salesmen, ask 
specifically for David Parker, as the rest of the counter-persons are 
clueless as a clam on this particular item.  He will sell you one of these 
kits for the princely sum of ~$11.00 US plus shipping.  As of last week, 
they still had 2 in stock, though Monseur Parker promised to support all 
the business I could send his way.  Standard disclaimers apply.  I ain't 
even that thrilled with these folk generally, as I have had any number of 
orders misfilled, but I do trust this one guy a bit and all they have to 
handle is two letters, a number and a hyphen.  Try your local people 
first, but if that doesn't work I offer this as an alternative.
