Subject: Trans question and 70 bus for sale

[snip]
I was in a local salvage yard today and spoted a very nice 70 bus. It
has all the windows but no seats (like a cargo type) It is complete
minis some minor stuff. No rust that I could see,only one sizeable dent
just above the front bumper(2ft wide x 2in deep) The motor and trans
were there and complete. New carb and coil. This is a real nice bus but
I was told that it does not run. They want $350 for it. I would buy it
but have no money or storage space for another car.
Please someone rescue this nice bus from further damage. It is in the
Tacoma Wa. area. I will be glad to give anyone more info if you want it.
Don't let it be crushed!
