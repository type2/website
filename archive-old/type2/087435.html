&lt;&lt; If these numbers are important to you, mount the guages on a pod on top of
the dash.  The closer the guages are to your line of sight, the more
likely you are to notice a problem before it gets bad.

Also if you mount them in the rubber VDO pod under the dash, they can reflect 
off your knee and on the windshield at night.
