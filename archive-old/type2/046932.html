I put a small, [thick] washer under that hanger bolt bolt.  it keeps  it
away from the bell housing enough for my 17mm *long socket w/ a long and
short extension on it* to fit in there and snug it down. Makes it easier,
and allows you to do the wrenching work from just in front of the Bowden
tube bracket.

&gt; &gt;&lt;&lt; I wouldn't want to drive on a long trip to anywhere in a car that's
&gt; &gt;worth $2000 or $3000. Consider it a measurement of risk. &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Different yard sticks for different people, I guess. This weekend passed
the
&gt; 53K mark on our $400 junker Westfakia (CYW in Tenn...GREAT parts supply as
&gt; usual). There have been few problems..well, Karl might think more than a
few
&gt; :), but in our 45K travels/year..all in Vintage Vdubbs, we've been either
&gt; fortunate with the travel gods..or VW built a fairly reliable product. I
&gt; have little fear of taking off on a 1k mile round trip with minimal
&gt; preparation.
&gt;
&gt; While it's true we are retired and so don't have the gotta-get-back
&gt; pressures of a working stiff, I also took a 63 Notchback
crosscountry...with
&gt; small kids... 3 tmes in the mid to late 70's..and I did &quot;have to get
there&quot;
&gt; then.
&gt;
&gt; If a possible small delay is bothersome, You'd prolly be better off saving
&gt; the bus for saturday trips..but the time comes when most of us are able to
&gt; get rid of the SUK's etc....and go with the flow.
&gt;
&gt; Good luck til then.
&gt;
&gt; Bus question:
&gt;
&gt; Ran into several folks (two of whom own &quot;VW shops&quot;) this weekend, who say
&gt; they leave the upper left engine hanger bolt out of the upright &quot;because
&gt; it's hard to get to&quot;. Getting ready to hang one back in..and I definitely
&gt; don't recall that being more than a minor problem, overcome by a few well
&gt; chosen words ...tho I futz mostly with pancakes lately. Anyone running
with
&gt; 3 bolts?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks, Marv Krupp..buyer of a million parts..eater of beans-only this
&gt; month...
