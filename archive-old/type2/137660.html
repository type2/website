Subject: Re: [T2] CIS components?

Well, a carb could definitely get you back on the road faster. It just
depends on what is available to you in the used dept and what you want
to do. A friendly doesn't-nickel-and-dime-you-to-death wrecking yard
could supply all the CIS system from fuel pump to injectors removed as
a whole for a very low price.

The AFM you are referring to is generally referred to as the entire
air cleaner/fuel distributor/flapper box. Picked up a few of these in
my day at pick n pull for $20 each.

 anyway, the current kit from Gary Miller doesn't
 include a lot of things one might find in a junkyard.
 that's fine, but i'm trying to get an idea how much
 all those things might cost.
 i've been researching the parts for volvos and rabbits
 and can't figure out what Gary means by air/fuel
 meter.  is this the airflow meter or the actual fuel
 distributor?
 
 can anyone who has done this conversion give me a
 ballpark estimate as to what it costs?  also, if
 anyone has parts numbers for the components i'd
 appreciate that because i really don't know what i'm
 looking for.
 
 i'm afraid i might have to go with a carburator just
 for economic reasons.
 
 cheers,
 will
