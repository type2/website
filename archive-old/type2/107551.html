Subject: greasing rear wheel bearings in place

Hi All,

    Terry wrote...&quot;And if a guy was smart--he would take the time to
drill and tap a grease fitting into the rear hub--so this ordeal would
be a thing of the past--&quot;....

I know there is, or was, someone on this list who had devised a way to
grease rear wheel bearings that were still installed.  I can't
remember who it was or the details of what he did.  Does anyone else
know?
