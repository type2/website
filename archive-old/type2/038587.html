Subject: Re: the damn reflectors..

&gt;you know...i'm sure i'm not the only one who notices this.._dot_can we get the
&gt;URL for the damn things to be a bit more..uh..remeberabel?

Good point. Now you can pull up the lists' web reflectors with these more
intuitive URLs:

	www.type2_dot_com/type2reflect

	www.type2_dot_com/vintagebusreflect

Don't forget to try the &quot;Thread View&quot;, which is not the default but is much
easier to look at than &quot;Date View&quot; if you don't read too frequently or if
you like to scan subject lines.

	    Would rather count the grins and smiles
	        That come from driving day to day
	            Four wheels beneath a cargo bay.
