Man, I can't even tell you how happy I was to hear that motor &quot;purr&quot; like 
that. I've owned the Bus now for a little over 4 years. But for the past 3, 
I haven't driven it much, and it's been non-running for a good two years. I 
got it running again last summer, and it was so frustrating to hear the 
lifters rattling non-stop like that. No matter what I did, I couldn't get 
them to pump up. After replacing the entire left side, and adjusting the 
lash, it runs beautifully now. I'll probably swap out the other half next 
weekend.

&gt; Good for you! Long live Skipper. Next I suppose,
&gt; you'll be going with Skipper on a three-hour-tour.
&gt; Check the weather forcast before you leave! -BaH
