I am lookin to lower my 74 westy this summer and i have found two companys 
with two different ways of doing it 
SO 
my question to the list is has anyone had experience
with 
kruzinwagon from the land down under (australia) 
or 
bluebird-type2.co_dot_uk in jolly old england 
their product is called the Foksy front beam adjuster

Any input would be great 

Also does anyone know of someone in North America that has this type 
of product 

Thanks in advance to the whole lot of ya
