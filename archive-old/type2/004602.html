I have 1 Brand New VW Factory 1600 duel port engine for sale at a reduced
price. This engine was damaged in shippment and returned to me, The damage
consisted of bent push-rod tubes (which I have replaced). These engines now
sell new for 1399.99 and I am offering it for $1000.00 ( no core) plus
shipping. I have only 1 of these.

If interested please call   520  680-7664
