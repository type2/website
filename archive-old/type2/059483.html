Subject: Re: RE Heating a VW bus (and isolators)

I was just looking through the AAA catalog and saw a few items of
interest.  They make a ceramic heating element, with a fan, that plugs
into a cigarette lighter.  It sits on your dash and defrosts your window.
$50 for non members, $35 for members.  They also have heated seat covers,
don't know how well these work but they're $75 each.  I am now driving an
'81 Vanagon with great heat, but if I still had my '74 I'd definately buy
the windshield defroster.  I can deal with the cold, but when there is ice
on the window and no way to get rid of it I get kind of nervous.

Anyway, these items should all be on their web page, so check it out.  I
will be changing emails addresses, so I won't be able to respond to any
questions.
