Subject: Re: [T2] Splitting cases; WHY didn't someone mention this??? :-(

You have to remove the cylinders. There is no way to split the case
unless these 4 nice pieces of finned metal come off. Getting these
guys off might just be as easy as trying to remove one at a time. But
I can imagine that all 4 at the same would be quite a task, esp if one
or more pistons are in a bind. Work one at a time till you have 4 cyls
removed. You will find you life much easier.

&gt; alignment, I can't withdraw the pistons... the whole rotating assembly is 
&gt; locked except for maybe 5 degrees of rotation. Further, I can get only 3 of 
&gt; the rod nuts off, so I can't remove the rods.
