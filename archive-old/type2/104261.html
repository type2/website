Subject: sliding door on a '78 Westy

Hi Type2 crew,

The upper rear slider on my '78 Westy's sliding door has an apparent 
operational life of 25 years. It now needs repair or replacement. I read 
the Type2 Library piece on sliders and I read the protocol in Bentley's 
Manual. I understand that the whole slider can be unbolted and replaced 
pretty easily if I can only find a replacement. I understand that the 
plastic block is available from Bus Depot for under $5, but other parts of 
that gizmo apparently are made of Unobtanium. 

I haven't yet taken the slider cover off so I can get a real good look at 
the problem. But when I slide the door forwards, the rear half of the rear 
upper slider swings off the track and out, pushing out the sheet metal of 
the cover if I let it. A piece of the plastic block on the slider broke 
off. From what I can see, that may be the only thing that holds it on the 
track. The roller seems to still roll, but the rear end of the slider no 
longer remains attached to the track like it's supposed to. 

Two questions: 
1)  anyone with more bus experience than I done this repair before? Is it 
just a question of replacing the plastic block? I'm a little leery of 
getting into this repair, being unable to finish it, and being stuck 
driving a bus with the sliding door off. 

2)  anyone know of a source for a good used upper rear slider unit? The 
Type2 Library article says they are increasingly hard to find at junk 
yards.

Let me know.

Drive safely,
