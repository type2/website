Subject: Early Bus cot to bed

Hi Adam,
I converted my '69 camper before I knew there used to be a cot up there.  
I started w/ a 4'x8' sheet of 3/4&quot; plywood (you might be able to get away w/
thinner) and cut a rectangle just as wide as the tracks (supposed to be for
sunroof) and maybe 6&quot; longer than the hole.  Beveled the edges and cut and
hinged two doors at the front, maybe 1/4 of total length.  Then covered the
whole thing w/  vinyl w/ some padding underneath.
When not in use the board slides back where a sunroof would, and extended
the hinged doors rest on the front of the opening.  Flip one door up and use
the backwards facing seat behind the driver to climb up.
I usually use a thermarest, and keep in mind the space is shorter than the
newer ones, so if you're over about 5'8&quot; you'll be touching on both ends.  

Enjoy,
Wilson
'69 Westy (sort of, not in sight anyway,  my roommate drove it from NC to
CA)
