&lt;&lt; If I was going to redesign the bus system it would be based around an 
electric fuel pump. It would either include a loop of fuel line that goes 
up into the elephant ear and then to the engine to stop gravity fed leaks 
or an in-tank pump with fuel takeoffs on top.

Since we're in never-never-land...You'd also include a fuel cell instead of
a leaky fuel tank.. ;-)
(BTW, the cost of a custom fuel cell is around what most have paid for
their Busses... ;-(
