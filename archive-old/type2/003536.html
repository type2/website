reply to Bookwus-
 i've never understood why vw would make a hinge without a pin. but they did.
you will have to remove the hinges and drill them  to .200 to receive a  3/16 &quot;roll pin&quot;
so be sure to have the pin in hand first and drill carefully in several increasing steps
(start with 1/8 &quot; ).  you will have to align the holes so the pin will work.  i also mig weld
one end of the hinge/ pin although the pin does fit tight, and you can grease the hollow
pin with a needle grease gun attachment.

&gt;So I'm opening the engine compartment lid (70 Bus) to take a look at my
&gt;distributor when the whole lid comes off the body in my hands.  My first
&gt;thought was, &quot;Gee, it's not supposed to do this.&quot;  Then I looked at the
&gt;hinges thinking that the hinge pin must be rusted and busted.  Imagine my
&gt;surprise when I could find no hinge pin.  So what is the deal with these
&gt;funky little hinges?  Nothing on them in any of the manuals.  Mine are not
&gt;going together again in any sort of lasting way so can I get replacements
&gt;without going to the salvage yard?  AND............  since my engine lid is
&gt;pretty dinged up I might as well replace that too.  Any of the aftermarket
&gt;guys carry this item?
