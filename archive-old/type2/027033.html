Subject: new engine door seal -- different design or wrong part?

Hi, folks--

I'm replacing the seal around my engine door, and what I got to replace it 
doesn't look like what's there now.

The new seal was made by West Coast Metrics and is in 4 pieces: two pieces 
38&quot; long, and 2 pieces 17&quot; long.  For the right-brained among us, I put a 
cross section drawing at

http://web.pdx_dot_edu/~d1bn/engine_seal.jpg

The tag on the new seal says &quot;Engine door seal   For all buses 55 - 71&quot;

The original is one piece, with molded corners to fit the metal groove 
around the hatch. The ends meet at bottom center. It's also noticeably 
nearer to square in cross-section [in the drawing I posted, the obtuse angle 
marked A is pretty much a 90-degree angle on the original seal--although 
since it's probably 30 years old that may not mean quite as much.]

Am I supposed to wedge the new stuff into the track and trim the ends to 
meet at the corners?  Doesn't look like it would seal as well that way . . . 
.   Or has my FLAPS sold me the wrong part [or some replacement that's so 
cheesy it might as well be the wrong part]?

Any advice is welcome.

Best,

Bill
