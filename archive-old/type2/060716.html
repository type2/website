Subject: ISO parts for my '77 Westy

I'm looking for a few parts for my '77 Westy. I'm in dire need of a new
left door, as the previous owner -- may the fleas of all the camels of
Araby infest his armpits -- seems to have used to mainly to rub up against
other vehicles. I don't care what color* it is, just that it isn't banged
up and has minimal rust.

I also need a set of engine tins. My bus was retrofitted with one of the
older (1971-ish?) upright 1600cc engines in place of the original pancake,
and whoever did the work was apparently unable to find tins to fit the new
configuration. It's my understanding that some European buses of the same
time period came from the factory with this setup, so they must be out
there somewhere. An acquaintance tells me that he came across a parts
supplier that sells them, but he can't remember who it was. If anyone
knows, you will earn my eternal gratitude and first dibs on my interior
cabinetry when I strip it out to install custom cabinets. ;-)

Thanks,
Eric


*The bus is approximately schoolbus yellow on the inside, but a previous
owner picked some less vibrant color when he had an extremely cheap paint
job done, which has since faded and become impossible to match. As a
consequence of that, and my ongoing efforts to remove and halt rust without
too much concern for the cosmetic results, the exterior now resembles one
of those do-it-yourself spraypaint camouflage patterns one sees on the
pickup trucks of deer hunters, except that the dominant hues are sunflower
yellow and safety orange.
