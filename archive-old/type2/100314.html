Subject: FS: 1970 VW Bus (northeast ohio)

Hi All,

It's killing me to do this, but I'm going to have to pass my bus on to
a new owner. &quot;Mimi&quot;, formerly known as &quot;Stella Blue&quot;, is just getting
to be too much for me to deal with right now.

She's been running great -- easy cold starts, decent power -- but not
running right now. The doghouse tin vibrated loose, which caused the
alternator to vibrate loose, which made for lots of noise and a sudden
loss of electricity. I put it all back together and she ran fine, but
everything came loose again and I don't have the time, energy or
enclosed workspace to monkey with it anymore. Could probably be
straightened out in a couple hours in a dry, warm garage -- but since
I don't have one of those, it'll be up to her next owner.

The basics...

- 1970 VW bus, unknown miles
- 1600 Mexican block (relatively new)
- Solid frame, less-solid body
- New Bosch alternator
- New Solex PICT 30/31 carb
- New clutch, pressure plate and throwout bearing
- New battery
- Jensen CD player with very large speakers
- Replaced missing exterior trim pieces
- Fancy-shmancy hippie-style paint job
- New front and rear brakes and hardware
- New Bosch blue coil

What still needs done...

- Tighten down engine tins, remount alternator
- Bodywork (mostly solid, but needs work soon or it'll be worse)
- Interior panels missing (seats are all there and in decent shape)
- Window seals need replaced
- Get mechanical fuel pump working (using electric now)

What's included...

- Crappy set of interior panels (was going to use them as patterns)
- Headliner bows (complete set)
- New passenger-side dog-leg body panel
- Miscellaneous trim pieces (interior/exterior)
- Miscellaneous tune-up parts (points, condenser, plugs, etc.)

The particulars...

- Asking $2000 for the lot, but open to reasonable offers
- Will consider trade (like value or less)
- Located in Boardman, OH

Email me (sean_fulkerson_at_hotmail_dot_com) if you're interested or have
questions.

Thanks,

Sean
