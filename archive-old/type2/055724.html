Subject: Re: Eng Running Backwards

I've heard that the intense heat in the heads can be caused by carbon
buildup, from possibly bad/wrong gasoline. The carbon gets redhot and
ignites the unburned fuel ... NOT good for your engine.

&gt; explanations as to what causes an engine to run backwards after you
&gt; cut off
&gt; the ignition.  Everyone agrees it is indeed dangerous!
&gt;
&gt;         One explanation is that such intense heat in the heads will
&gt; ignite
&gt; unburned fuel and cause the engine to continue running.  I agree my
&gt; fuel
&gt; shut off is not functioning and letting the fuel continue to enter the
&gt;
&gt; intake.
