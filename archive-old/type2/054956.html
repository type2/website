Subject: How should I do this?

O.K a difficult one to decide.

Quite near my home there is a '79 bay camper that has not moved since '97,
it has a full length pop-top (screen to hatch), 3 way fridge, electric
hook-up &amp; the interior is excelent. Outside the cab doors &amp; some of the
gutters are a bit rusty but the whole van is in good shape, does this sound
like a 'Moonraker' to you?

I want to aproach the owners &amp; ask if they will sell the van any ideas?
