Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch problem

It sounds like you have the wrong pressure plate installed - at least those
were the symptoms i had when i had swapped a '81 vanagon engine into my '73
bay window - however I could shift into all the gears when the engine wasn't
running - but as soon as the engine was running it would shift at all!

I would look at the fingers in the middle of the pressure plate - make sure
they are exactly the same.

BTW the year of your bus and what size/kind of engine you have would be very
helpful to diagnose a problem as this.

good luck!

&gt; Hello guys
&gt;
&gt; After installed a new clutch set (throw-out bearing, disc and pressure
&gt; palte) , I found if I pushed the clutch pedal all the way down I was
&gt; unable
&gt; to engage any gear but if I pushed half way the gears engage easily so I
&gt; gave a less tension to the calbe and did a test drive with out problems I
&gt; let the car parked all nigth long with a reverse engage, this morning it
&gt; was
&gt; almost imposible to disengage the gear with the engine runing or not,
&gt; after
&gt; a while I manage my self to free the shifter and ride the car againg but
&gt; this time was terrible the way the gears engage if they finally does.
&gt; I took the flywheel to be resurfaced and have no free play in the pedal.
&gt; Any help will be higly apreciate like always.
&gt; Thanks in advance
&gt;
&gt;
