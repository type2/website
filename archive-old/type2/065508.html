Subject: PUYALLUP VW SHOW

I didn't pay attention earlier when the VW show at Puyallup
was discussed, as I was planning on being out of town.
My plans have changed, so now I want to go, but don't
know what day and time.  I know how to get to Puyallup
(pronounced pee-ooooo-leee-hoops by the not so locals),
and where to park, etc.

TIA!

 .....be on the road in no time.
