Subject: 009 distributors? not

Jesse L Reynolds says:

&gt;The bottom line?  Stick with a vacuum advance on an FI pancake.  Muir 
&gt;says it himself, tucked away in some later chapter.  Maybe in 
&gt;&quot;Suggestions and New Ideas&quot; ?  He says he likes the 009, but stick with 
&gt;the original in the later vans.

To add fuel to the fire (no, scratch that image): the mechanic teaching the
VW class I'm currently taking says, &quot;Stick with the stock distributor on
earlier buses, too.&quot; He says the 009 is fine for racing, but has a terrible
advance curve for daily driving. Believes the vacuum/centrifugal distributor
that came with the '71 is the best distributor VW ever made. He trained with
German VW factory mechanics and has 37 years experience, so perhaps he knows
whereof he speaks? 

Ha ha. I'm sure someone on this list disagrees, and will be happy to tell us
why...

cheers,

Steve Tokar '71
