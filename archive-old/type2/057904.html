Subject: 72 Westy on the road! (take 2)

After 5 months my 72 Westy is on the road!  I want to thank Mark Rissman
who helped me with a lot of parts collecting and labor and Michael
Harrison who helped with connecting the vacuum advance/retard lines.  I
drove it home from LA to San Diego Sunday night without incident.  I'm
happy to report it runs great.  Its quiet and smooth.  

There is one thing however.  I need the little tube for the accelerator
injector.  It take a while for me to get to highway speed without it.
Anyone know where I can get one?  I'd like to get it by this Friday so I
can drive to Jerome with Mark.  

Anyone in the San Diego going to Jerome?  I'd like to caravan if anyone
else is in the LA or San Diego is going.
