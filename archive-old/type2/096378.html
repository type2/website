Subject: Oil Cooler &amp; Sway Bar.

So I worked on my bus quite a bit the last couple of days in preparation 
for the trip up to Angels Camp for the High Sierra Music Festival. Finally 
got the second oil cooler all plumbed in, and installed the rear sway bar 
my wife bought me a long time ago. (Yes I have the best wife, and no you 
can't have her. ;)

I highly recomend adding beefy front and rear sway bars to your bus. The 
handling is so different now it is like driving a different car. I can 
take turns at speeds that are reasonable, and I am blown around a lot less 
in the wind.

As for the oil cooler, I took it for a test run around town and on the
highway yesterday. It took awhile to push oil through the whole system and
get pressure again,which was perhaps the most unnerving part of the
install. I disconnected the sparc and the fuel pump and cranked it till
the oil light went out, but it took awhile. Oil pressure at startup is
about 7 psi lower than it was before I put the cooler in, or about 55 psi. 
The pressure seems to fall a little slower when I take my foot off the 
gas. Warmup took a little longer then it used to, but once the oil reached 
185 when the thermostat seems to open it took quite awhile for it to climb 
up to 200 on the highway. So far I am happy.

I will let you all know how it goes on the trip to Angel's Camp when I get 
back, and post some photos of the whole setup. There are some steep grades 
on the drive that definately made me run hot hot hot on the way up there 
last year. My hope is that the extra cooler keeps me running fast and 
cool.

My engine runs cool now, I just like to drive faster than I am supposed to
in a bus. According to Saint Hoover, it is not neccesary to add an extra
oil cooler to my bus _unless_ I want to run long stretches at high RPM,
which is _exactly_ what I want to do. I know I am shortening the life of
my engine by keeping it going faster for long stretches. However,
everything has a trade off. I love my bus, and I love touring at higher
speeds. One of these days I will put in a freeway flyer transmission to
bring the revs down on the highway. I also know there is a chance that the 
cooler et all will lower the pressure in the galeys in bad ways. So my 
question is, are there high presser/high volume upgrades for the type 4 
oil pump.

Thanks,
