Subject: Re: [T2] Distributor drive gear backwards...Cheap fix??

Hi John,

Try this, it worked for me.

1. Buy a new, high-quality non-mechanical pencil without an eraser on 
the end.
2. Drive it into the center hole of the distributor drive gear.
3. Pull gently upwards on the pencil.

It's a ten cent solution that can save you buying or borrowing a $50 
tool.

If the pencil is too soft,  try using a section of hardwood dowel 
instead. But that's gonna cost ya. ;-)

It might not work 100% of the time, but it's certainly worth trying.

Happy trails,
