Subject: What price the Bus I love? [Long]

Hello All,

I couldn't resist jumping in (if only to laugh at myself, which ain't hard
to do given the givens).  And it's Friday!!

I have this problem with time standing still in my head. As far as I'm
concerned I'm still 24 and Gus is brand new. I'd like to think we are in the
peak of physical condition (boy he sure *looks* better than I do!) but the
fact is that we're both getting long in the tooth. So I was in deep denial
when it came time to do some important things.

Back when I *was* 24 we didn't have a lot of money, so when Gus got sick my
husband used to say, &quot;He's your car, you fix him.&quot; So I did. It's a minor
miracle that Gus and I are still alive (Hey, Mark, I resemble that remark
about the McDonald's straws and wire ).
;-)  Parts weren't cheap and there weren't that many available in junk yards
then so Caucasian engineering was sometimes a must. That was then, this is
now.

Now, I keep forgetting that I don't fit under Gus so well (that *$#_at_!!
stomach or butt keeps getting in the way) and that Gus is 21 years old!
Yipes! Stuff is falling off both of us! The way of all flesh (and sheet
metal)... Anyhow the upshot is that I just dropped $1,000.00 on getting Gus
up to a point where I *know* he will stop if I step on the brakes, his
little transmission is all safe and happy, his fuel lines no leaky pas, his
injectors inject, his fuel filter is all nice and clean ,in short, I can
drive him safely.  All this and more was done by the redoubtable Dr. Jimmy.
This is absolutely the *most* I have ever spent on Gus and I know that I am
very, very lucky (ask me about the '72 my parents had one time or &quot;How I
Learned to Disrespect Volkswagen of NA&quot;).

 I don't drive him all the time now, (although I think I probably could and
it would probably do him better than letting him sit for a week at time) and
I don't depend on him for my &quot;main&quot; car. As much as I love him, I have to
admit there were plenty of times in the past when I worried about making it
to class or to a meeting when he *was* #1. So I am content to let him be
what he is;  a neat, lovable, German delivery van that doesn't go very fast
but you can live in him, type of person.

Chris and Gus the &quot;accent on lovable&quot; Bus
