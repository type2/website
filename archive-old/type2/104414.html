Subject: Re: [T2] no heater boxes? safe?

&gt; If you have a late baywindow some cooling air is always flowing through the 
&gt; heater box and it gets dumped outside through the flapper or sent up front 
&gt; to the cabin depending on how cold natured you and your passengers are.
&gt; 
&gt; The hot weather air flow is to keep the heater box and thus the head a bit 
&gt; cooler so basically you could be causing the heads to be a bit hotter.

??? OK I solved that problem by removing ALL of the heater boxes and using
bare pipes...moving air from driving will keep it cooler than the air flow
thru the heater boxes, and because the heater fan duct is sealed that
means more air for cooling..  I have temp guages and haven't noticed any
difference

I also have changed my 78 to the early 72-74 exhaust system too so there
is less piping to get hot
