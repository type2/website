Subject: Re: [T2] alt vs.gen

advantages to alterntor:

More amps.
Lighter.
simpler.
Brushes last longer

Advantages to Generator:

you have them and they work.

Both devices work very well.  I waited until I had a problem with my
generator to convert.  Conversion was easy, but try to use real VW parts.
the &quot;conversion kits&quot; have tin and stand of dubious Chinese quality.  IF
you're converting from a bus 38A generator you will need a new fan hub.
