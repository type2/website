&gt; My Questions
&gt; 1. The gas question...is it really okay to run 87 octane?

If it doesn't ping, yes. If the CR has been bumped, maybe no.

&gt; 2. Oil-I live in sacramento, where it gets about 100 degrees on average in
&gt; the summer-I'm using strait 30 weight now-should I change?

Yes. 40 or 20/50.

&gt; 3. Speed-How fast should I drive on the freeway-it screams past 60mph

3350 rpms.

&gt; [snip] Considering I've got less than two grand ...

Then you have just less than two grand more than me.
