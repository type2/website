Subject: Re: [T2] odometer not working - replace plastice gear

Hi all,
I've never had the bus Speedo/odo apart, but had the same problem on my '73
beetle (I think the Speedo was made in Australia in my '73). The plastic
gear had simply split and was slipping on the shaft and consequently no
longer driving the odo. Luckily there was a shoulder on the gear, so what I
did to fix it was to turn up a small aluminium sleeve. I then slid/pressed
the sleeve over the shoulder on the gear which gave the gear enough pressure
on the shaft to drive it.
I also roughened the shaft to help prevent slipping.
It was a very fiddly job, but it's been working fine for 3-4 years now.
Hope this helps.
Richard,
