Subject: Re: [T2] Paint


Hi Lois,
	My '70 Deluxe is a nice dark green.  It isn't OEM Westy(if you care), but 
it IS VW.  You may want to look at a color-code chart at a nearby automotive 
paint supplier.  They have pages of colors and codes for you to look at.

	Eron
&gt;
&gt;Hi Folks
&gt;
&gt;Did any of the Westies come in a nice dark green or blue?
&gt;
&gt;Bertha's color is NOT my fave and I'd like to change it when she gets a 
&gt;roof.
&gt;
