Subject: RE: [T2] Bite Sized Chunks

&gt; I know from experience that coils can go on strike
&gt; when they get hot, and then when you've stopped 
&gt; and they cool off a bit they work again  .. It is 
&gt; definitely not true that they 'just die'


I have had the same experience (fine when cold, intermittant failure when
hot).  But I have also had one or two &quot;just die.&quot;
