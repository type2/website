Subject: Re: [T2] Gel Battery

Vanagon Man sends:

&gt; The Gel type Optima batteries do not ruin your sheet metal if they leak.
&gt; This is the main reason a person will choose an Optima (or other gel-type
&gt; battery) IMHO.  If I have just repaired a floor pan in my beetle, or a
&gt; battery shelf in one of my busses, the last thing I want to do is do it
&gt; again.  With a gel-type battery, my battery shelf will not rust out from
&gt; battery acid ever again!!  I would rather spend $80 extra now, and have the
&gt; peace of mind that another rustoration will not have to be repeated.

I'm going to just coat the battery shelf with POR-15 (which may or may not
be completely rustproof, but it is acidproof), set the battery in a boat
battery box for extra assurance, and be done with it. Much cheaper and as
effective.

If I had a Miata, which comes stock with a gel battery because it rides in
the trunk with a little bit of your stuff, that would be different.
