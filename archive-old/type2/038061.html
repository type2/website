That little elbow on the tank was exactly what was wrong with mine.  I rebuilt
the carb a couple of months ago, and since that was out of the way, I decided
to pull the access panel, too.  Anyway, I fixed it with 1/2&quot; fuel line and a
couple of hose clamps.  Since then I've not had a whiff of gasoline in my bus.

Oh, and yes, if you thought getting the panel out was backbreaking, putting it
back in will be (if my experience is anything to go by) worse.  And I've got a
73 with a top engine hatch.  Mine had been mangled a little by some PO, so I
think that added to the difficulty, though.  Good luck.

&gt; So where am I now? Well, I'm temporarily screwed until I can find a
&gt; replacement for the fuel fitting because (of course) VW doesn't carry it
&gt; anymore.... Part No: 211 201 157 A in case you are interested/have an extra.
&gt; Maybe I can rig something.... I got eberspacher, heater fan and various
&gt; fittings and hoses strewn around the garage (I'll probably never get those
&gt; darn vacuum lines back on right). The back panel is out and it'll most
&gt; likely be hell getting in back in. With luck I'll have it all back together
&gt; by the beginning of June. But I guess I can look on the bright side: The
&gt; engine seal replacement is now a piece of cake. Oh yeah, my back is killing
&gt; me and I never made it to fixing the oil leak...
