Subject: Re: [T2] Leaking egr valve, rough idle

&gt; When I replaced the engine I

What did you use for a gasket?

&gt; The valve is leaking air around the lever that is pulled when the  
&gt; throttle is
&gt; turned. The more the throttle is turned the louder the hissing. I  
&gt; think the
&gt; diaphragm inside has torn or just fallen apart with age? Would this  
&gt; leak cause
&gt; the rough idle?

Sure. This is what the valve looks like:

&gt; Oddly enough cylinder head temps have been fine, between 300
&gt; and 375 depending on speed and load. Doesn't a vacuum leak normally  
&gt; cause
&gt; higher head temps?

It depends on how bad it is. What's you vacuum level at idle?

&gt; Looked at how the EGR linkage is attached to the throttle with a  
&gt; mirror. Seems
&gt; to be a round washer pressed on the linkage instead of the C clip I  
&gt; expected.
&gt; Any advise on removing the EGR linkage from the throttle without  
&gt; removing the
&gt; throttle would be great.

You can undo the hex nut in the middle used to adjust it and the  
linkage splits in two.
