Subject: Warm air hose

Good parts from junk yard bays are getting harder to find in the NOVA / MD /
Wash DC area.

CRay's in Hawkins Point MD has a well picked over late bay Westy.  However,
last Saturday I was under it and I saw (1) a PERFECT warm air hose that goes
from the rear 'Y' to the front splash pan (you know what I mean...).  I
don't need it and I have NO ROOM for more stash.  Probably $8

FWIW..  http://crazyraysautoparts_dot_com/

Oh, yes, there are -3-  H2O Vanagons there, but sans fuel pumps...
