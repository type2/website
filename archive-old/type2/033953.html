Subject: steering box

Hi all,

     Anyone know of or have a good, used steering box for my 79 Std?  Mine
is really loose &amp; way past adjustment.  I have seen them for about $300 &amp; I
think that is rebuilt.  Also. is there anyway you can tell if a box is OK if
it out of the vehicle?  BTW, I am in Portland, OR.  Thanks.
