Subject: Overheating?

I know a big problem with the air-cooled engines is overheating.  Fine.  I 
accept that.  Well, I live in that ice covered tundra known as . . . Florida ;)

Yesterday, I was driving around quite a bit and I decided to stop at a gas 
station to pick up some Mt. Dew.  When I got back in the car to go, it 
wouldn't start.  An amusing visual for the sound it made would be a 
growling dog being bounced on one's knee....  It kept trying to start every 
couple moments but would die and then try again and die, etc., etc.  I 
played around with hoses, wires, etc. and couldn't figure it out.  Finally 
I gave up, went to class, and walked back to it when I was done with my 
test for the night.  It started up like there had never been a problem.

Did it just simply overheat and a starter relay didn't want to work anymore 
or what?  I definitely don't want this to happen again when I need to get 
somewhere during the day when it's hot out...  Any suggestions?  One 
thought I had during the looooong walk back to my car from campus was that 
I should store a bike in the back for when my bus inevitably fails ;)
