Subject: Re: [T2] Re: POR 15 Corrosion Control Process

You caught the double ended sword here--your on the ball--


Yep --even the weakest places on earth to get anything done don't use
it--

But--I forgot something really big here--
(Let me slap myself on the forehead once)

This is the first place I ever actually saw anyone admit to brushing and
rolling their vehicles and were proud of it---

Wh even bother with priming it with anything?

The Dutch Boy has 30 year house paint available-

I do believe I'm talking to something brick in nature--

&quot;Hello Wall&quot;---:&gt;)

Ok--lets talk about tire's or something new  and refreshing, and awe
inspiring now---

Take Care--

TK

 
Terry, And your point is that professional shops don't use it? Last time
I checked nobody ever thought the likes of Maaco, Earl Shieb etc, are
&quot;professional&quot; shops... In fact I'd be more concerned about using POR 15
if these outfits actually DO use it... LOL 
And no I'm not taking a position on POR, never used it, don't even own a
bus. But after reading your posts re POR over the past 2 years I'm
really surprised you would mention these companies in your ongoing
crusade to convince people that using POR to stop / slow rust is just
wrong, wrong, wrong...
