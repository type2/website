Nope, same as a standard loaf.  Off the top of my head, your looking for
0-3 mm of toe in, and 42 minutes of positive camber.  Let me check the
Bentley to be sure....

&quot;The front wheels should have 40' +- 20' of positive camber.  Also, the
differnce in camber between the wheels should not vary more than 30'.  If
not within specifications, the camber of each wheel should be adjusted to
as near 40' as possible&quot;

&quot;Shops with optical aligning devices should follow the equipment
manufacturers instructions to obtain a toe-in angle of 15' +- 15' or 5' +-
15' after addming 12-18 kg (27-39 lb) of extra weight above the wheel. The
maximum toe change should not exceed 25'&quot;

Using a track gauge, &quot;The measurement made at the rear should be 0.0 to
3.3mm greater.&quot; [ toe.. ]


Now, once you give these to your tire guys, they'll look at you, and say
&quot;We still cant do it.  Has to be in the computer&quot;  Gotta love it.  *sigh*


....david (who needs to get time to take Itchigo to Columbia to fix the
2-3 degrees of positive camber.....)
