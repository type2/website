&gt; He claimed his bus could go 120 MPH empty. When I questioned this
&gt; he said he had a high compression 1600cc and a Super Beetle tranny.
&gt; It still sounds a little exxagerated to me.

120 mph? empty, and dropped out of an airplane!  Man, oh-  I want some of the 
stuff that guy is doin.  My '89 Ford would be a Viper and my wife would be the 
spitting image of Cindy Crawford.  I'd look in the mirror and see... ohh  let me
think about this for awhile... hmmm.  He'd have hair...  oopps good thing its 
Friday.

Carpy.
