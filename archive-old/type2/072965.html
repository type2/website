Subject: Re: [T2] Learning to drive a bus

My first experience learning to drive a bus was with a boyfriend when I was
18 and him yelling, &quot;Don't pop the clutch!&quot; and clutching his head. I
didn't drive another bus until I was 29, and this other boyfriend yelled,
&quot;Watch out for the curb!&quot; while burying his face in his hands. I didn't
drive another bus until I got my own at the age of 40, and at first only
under cover of darkness locally.

So I agree with everything that's been said so far on The List:

Lesson #1 -- Find a patient teacher. ;-)

Lesson #2 -- Learn the feel of the clutch on level ground. Then try it on a
hill. Get really comfortable with it.

Lesson #3 -- Remember that you're sitting on the front wheels, especially
when turning and parallel parking. It's a whole different curve than a
passenger car.

Lesson #4 -- Learn what your engine is supposed to sound like when you need
to shift. First use your speedometer, then your ear, and if you have a
tach, get friendly with it, but I think the ear has priority. My Muir book
is at the shop with my bus so I can't' quote him, but he's got a really
good rap about at what speeds you should shift a VW. That's a good starting
point. Then see how it applies to your particular bus and adjust it
slightly -- Wendelin shifts most smoothly into Third at about 33 mph; at 30
she bogs down and at 35 her rpms drop too much in the time it takes me to
shift.

Don't lug (under-rev) or wind-out (over-rev) the engine. It'll last a lot
longer. :-)
