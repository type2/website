Subject: Re: What Distributor Do I have??

[...]

&gt; I am still in the process of tuning the 1600DP engine in my
 &gt; '71 camper van .  I know that the type of distributor has an impact
 &gt; on how the ignition timing should be set, so I am trying to
 &gt; determine what distributor I have.  Bently says the '71 should have
 &gt; combination vacuum and centrifugal advance and vacuum retard.
 &gt; The distributor I have is a 231 177 036.  It has only one vacuum
 &gt; line going to it from the carb (vacuum advance).  I cannot find this
 &gt; distributor number in Bently or any of the other manuals I have.
 &gt; Does anyone know anything about this distributor??  Thanks.


 Are you sure it is 231 177 036?  Could it possibly be 231 137 036?  Is
there
 a VW # on it also, like 113 905 205T? If yes: this is a 70 Beetle dist.
