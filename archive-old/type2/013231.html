Hi All,

The biggest problems I've run into are what to set the
compression to and how to get good hot idle oil
pressure (HIOP).  Hiop is what you measure after a
half hour or more of 55 mph driving on a hot summer
day.  Mofoco will definitely not specify what HIOP
you'll get after a rebuild.  I got the impression they
don't have a clue.

I'm having my 80 Westy rebuilt again to try for more
power and better HIOP.  I'd like at least 15 psi hiop
(believe me it's tough to get, unless you train your
rebuilder, or are very meticulous), and 135 psi
compression.

I can imagine it's a heck of a lot of work R&amp;R ing a
Type 4.  Although my rebuilder agreed to try again, I
offered to help him out by getting a top quality crank
(I think the key to hiop) and rod set.  However, I
think my kind list sources for these parts dried up
when they realized I wasn't actually rebuilding it
myself.  Good luck.

Rob
