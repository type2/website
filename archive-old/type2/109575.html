Subject: RE: [T2] Stupid tie rod question

Interesting point. I have just been told by two Australian VW places the
fixed ones are NLA.
I hadn't thought about fitting two adjustable ones though, sounds like a
good solution. Any brands to stay clear of??
On the issue of steering, I have also been told it's worth replacing the
'centre steering pin' if your going through the whole steering system.
What's involved in replacing this?
Cheers,
