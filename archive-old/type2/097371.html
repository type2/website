Subject: An EGR valve question

Hi all:

I'm still struggling to figure out if I'm going to keep the exhaust system
on my '82 as the original &quot;Federal&quot; system or convert over to the California
system.  I've got pieces of both systems and can get the rest, one way or
another.  But, if I convert to the California exhaust setup the EGR system
changes radically.

Here's the question:

Is the EGR valve itself the same on the Federal and California systems?

The '82 seems to have a more-or-less working EGR valve (the rest of the
system is pretty poor) and it looks like the California
EGR-filter-to-EGR-valve pipe (which I have) will fit, but I'm not sure if
the internal workings and settings are the same on Federal and California
systems.  The manuals certainly indicate you adjust them differently, but
I'm not sure if that's because of different smog standards or different
functioning.  Anybody have any part #'s?

TIA.
