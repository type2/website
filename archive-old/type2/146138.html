KISS - Keep It Simple. 

It takes spark, gas, air. Ignition, carb, and compression. 

If you can hear the engine pumping as it rolls over you likely have compression (move that check to the bottom of your list). 

Take the air cleaner off and pump the gas while you look down the carb (engine not on or turning). Do you see or hear a squirt of gas? (Move that check to the bottom of your list). You could also feed it a few tablespoons of gas and try to start it. Just pour it down the carb and then hop into the seat and crank. 

Ignition: see if the coil will put out a spark to the head of one of the shroud screws. You need to hold the coil wire with insulated pliers and/or a rag or rubber glove so you don't get shocked. Pull the coil wire off the distributor and hold it near a screw head (1/16&quot;) and have a friend crank the engine. Get a nice fat blue spark? Good, ignition is good though it could be timed all wrong (distributor clamp slipped). No spark? That electronic ignition module is dead. Not uncommon. If it is a Pertronix you've got to match the coil with the unit. If the previous owner did not it causes an early death for the unit. The coils I have worked with slowly degrade and never suddenly fail. The electronic ignition modules do suddenly die. 

So let's swap it out for the points and condensor. Clean everything as you go. 

You may have to statically time it the first time and then fine tune with a timing light. Muir can tell you how better than I. 

I think it is the ignition module.
