Subject: Re: turn signals don't work!

&gt;My turn signals on my '69 Westy stopped working 3 days ago and I'm not
&gt;sure why. I inspeced all the fuses and they're fine. While checking
&gt;the fuses, I noticed a wire had come loose under the dash. It was
&gt;black and red and comes from the turn signal unit, but I can't see
&gt;where it terminates. I plugged it back in and still nothing.

Did you get an answer on this? Every time I poke around under the dash I
knock that wire loose and my turn signals quit. It hooks up to a peculiar
rectangular clear plastic connector with a spade lug inside. There's
another wire in there next to it as well, they come two to a box. Am I
making sense? If I were there I could spot it right off but I can't explain
it too well.

Also check for corrosion at the pods, an ever-present danger.
