Subject: Re: [T2] Window Rubber Replacement Including the Chrome Strips?

The way I understand it the side window rubbers with chrome strip in them are 
only available for converted panel vans ( the chrome strip is fitted later to 
seal the windows securely, the seals without a chrome strip are for vans that 
came with windows, and the two seal types are not interchangeable. However I 
stand to be corrected on this. mel
