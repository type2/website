It sure sounds like the oil pump isn't priming; did you pack it full of 
vasoline or white grease before installing it?  (Recommended by Tom 
Wilson in his book.)

Before I'd pull the engine and tear it down I'd spend a few bucks and try 
the method recommended by Hoover.  He says before first start up on a new 
engine to first prime the entire oil system by using a one of those hand 
pump type sprayers (the kind you might use to spray insecticide) attached 
at the oil pressure sensor hole.  Look in the archives and I'm sure 
you'll find his discussion about this.
