Subject: My Coil is 'throwing off&quot; the cable!

Hi All,

My bus, a 72 with a 76 drivetrain (2000cc with Fuel
injection) is well doing something strange. The coil
(A 7 year old Blue Bosch Coil) is 'throwing off' the
coil ignition cable! Twice the coil cable that
connects to the top of the distributor cap has just
come off while I'm driving. Is this a sign the coil is
arcing out??? I just had the distributor rebuilt (my
previus timing trouble solved). Just mentioning in
case there might be a connection, no pun intended. Now
does anyone have any idea why the coil wire would just
come off like this? The wire set is fairly new. Any
ideas??

Thanks,

Rae
