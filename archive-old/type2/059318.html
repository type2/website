Subject: romantic evening and cold weather

Last night I spent a couple hours with Kate, my '78 Westy.  It started
out as just an oil change and turned into a wonderful evening.  I never
knew one could find so much joy in changing the oil.  I pulled the oil
sump cover off while the oil was drained to check it out, as I plan to
install an oil temp/pressure sender in the near future.  Anyways, the
more time I spend with Kate, the more I become infatuated with her.
Which makes my next move even more difficult.

So all you Colorado list members listen up...  What is the CO
winter/summer/mountainous terrain like on a 20 year old air cooled,
underpowered, overweight VW bus?  I've considered a move to the Boulder,
CO, area and am curious to the driving conditions.  i.e., could I rely
on my bus (given she's mechanically sound) as a daily driver in the
area.  With weekend trips to the ski slopes? Or, heaven forbid, would I
be better off with Vanagon Syncro for the winter months and storing my
78 during the winter.

Any feedback would be appreciated...  

Alabama Pete and Kate, the 78 Westy
