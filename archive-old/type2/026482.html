Subject: RE:  Windage Tray in Type IV engine
Message-ID: &lt;D3C18AEA0EA1D111B8DA00805F85E889011F8DE1_at_DSNTEXSRV3&gt;

&gt;I do not recall a windage tray coming out of my Type 4 engine 
&gt;and I can't find one among my parts. Were buses treated 
&gt;differently here? Is a windage tray really required?

The windage tray is a big flat sheet of tin shaped like a balooned-out &quot;H&quot;
with a bunch of slots in it and 4 red rubber seals on each of the 4 arms of
the &quot;H&quot;.  It sits flat - down toward the bottom of the case

I thought they were Porsche 914-only parts, but I've heard a few bus owners
saying they've got them as well.  As far as my limited understanding goes,
the early (pre-72) 914 1.7 engines didn't have them either.  Every 914 2.0
I've ever seen the innards of has one.

The purpose of the windage tray is to help keep oil in the bottom of the
case during severe cornering (ie. autocrossing or road racing).  Basically,
it helps keep the oil from sloshing up against the side of the case which
would starve the oil-pickup tube.

I wouldn't worry about not having one in a bus.  The only time I can think
of where you might actually get some use out of one is if you were doing
serious off-roading where the bus was continuously rocking VIOLENTLY from
side-to-side.  And you'd probably tip the poor thing over before the oil
pickup starved :-).
