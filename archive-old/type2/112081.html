Subject: Question about strange tranny

Hey Y'all,
My friend got a transmission that he was told came out
of a 69 bus.  I have a 1600 DP engine (12V) that I
wanted to test before installing, so I borrowed his
tranny and hooked the engine and starter up to it.
When I electrified the starter, I heard the solenoid
click out and the starter motor began to spin freely.
However, it did not engage the flywheel, so the engine
didn't turn.  I made sure everything was connected
right, it was. Un-connected, re-connected and tried
again. Same result.  Turns out the the Bell housing on
this tranny was to thick or wide for the starter drive
to engage the flywheel, at its fullest extension it
was short of engaging. 
I looked closely at the tranny and the VW number on
the bell housing started with &quot;411&quot;
Anyone know anything about a tranny like this? Is it
something other than bus? Maybe Type 3 or late bus??
