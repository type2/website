&gt; Hiya List!

&gt; Had my carb dialed in on a gas analyzer today.  While I was having that done
&gt; the service advisor mentioned that one of the worst things one could do to an
&gt; AC engine was to run oyxegenated fuel.  The stuff with a percentage of
&gt; alcohol in it.  He says it makes the engine run hotter and actually seems to
&gt; have an &quot;abrasive&quot; (his term) quality which just destroys internals.

Check to see what research the &quot;service advisor&quot; has done in this field.
Has he actually run instrumented engines on both fuels and seen a
difference?  I'll bet not.

The point is moot anyway, since oxygenated fuel is all you can get if it
is mandated, and if it isn't mandated the refiners won't produce it since
it costs more.

Alcohol isn't abrasive, and this assertion is another indication that this
guy is just trying to puff himself up in your eyes.
