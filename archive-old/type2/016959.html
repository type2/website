Subject: distributor question

I've been thinking about installing a vacuum advance distributor on my
'69 bus 1600, to replace the 009.  I know there is much talk of this in
the archives so I don't want to start a new debate.  
Is the distributor from a 2 liter vanagon engine compatible with the
1600? I thought I had heard it was both vacuum and mechanical advance. 
Don't have any vanagon manuals handy so I really don't know if they are
at all interchangable.  I've got a good vanagon distributor for free, or
could get a good vacuum advance from a beetle cheap from a friend.  Any
advice?
Thanks,

Andy
