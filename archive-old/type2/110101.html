Subject: Re: [T2] Add-on taillight assemblies?

&gt; But.  What if there was a housing that would attach to the rear-facing side
&gt; of the engine compartment intakes on either side of at bus like my `77 bay;
&gt; a housing that would allow the installation of some factory or generic
&gt; modern taillight fixture (brake and stop light) that would be tied into the
&gt; existing circuits through relays.

I thought about cutting a piece of aluminum to make a bracket to go over the
standard taillight hole and accept three LED taillights (brake/running, turn
and reverse). I'm not interested in original look...
