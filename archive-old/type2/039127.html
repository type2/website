Subject: Re: help with hot engine??

you should definitely order a new foam engine seal
IMMEDIATELY, that might not solve your problem, but it
will certainly cool that engine a bit.   the engine
compartment should be almost airtight as far as the
tin is concerned, those gaps are letting the air pass
through when it needs to be passing through the
cooling fan and directed through the oil cooler and
across the engine.   you could kill this motor driving
around with missing engine seals or tin (ask me how i
know)   aside from that nice lookin motor:)   good
luck and you should post a couple bus pics on your
site so we can check out the new ride:)

&gt; &gt; OK, , ,
&gt; &gt; Now I've had the bus long enough to know what
&gt; questions to ask , , , , , ,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; After driving in  town, just a short trip, When
&gt; shut down, this puppy
&gt; &gt; is hottr'n a popcorn, , , well, you know.
&gt; &gt; Actually it's about as hot as if you had driven a
&gt; water cooled engine
&gt; &gt; without water.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Smokin' hot!!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I suspect the carb is set too lean.
&gt; &gt; It's a '72 with single carb.
&gt; &gt; The tin has large gaps it it, also. Would that be
&gt; a problem?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Can any one help me out here?
&gt; &gt; TIA
&gt; &gt; Ron C.
&gt; &gt; ps, ,  I think I'll take a quick photo of the
&gt; engine room and
&gt; &gt; post it, where you can see it.
