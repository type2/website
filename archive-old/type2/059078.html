Subject: RE:Driving in snow

Ed,
 The bus is infact in it압 element when it comes to snow. The engine is in
the rear with the transmission and the fueltank, so there압 a lot of weight
on the driving wheels. Here in Finland we have snow 4-5 months a year. We
cheat a little by using studded winther wheels during that time. Don앖 know
if they are legal where you live. Basicly they are &quot;Mud and snow&quot; marked,
usually reads &quot;M+S&quot; somewhere on the tyre. The studs doesn앖 help much in
deep snow but are very good on packed snow and ice. 

 The bus handeles pretty much like any other car. The feeling when the rear
end slides out is a bit different because You are sitting almost in front
of the front wheels, but you앏l get used to it :-) If Your bus has a manual
tranny it압 easier to controll the traction, the automatic can sometimes
shift up or down when You at last expect it with horrible results. 

 Loading the bus in different manners also has effects on the handeling
characteristics. Putting the cargo far back in the bus helps in deep sow.
Putting the stuff in the front of the cargo area helps braking on slippery
surfaces. Don앖 know how the weight is distributed on the westphalia. There
are no westies here in Finland, well mabye some but I았e never seen one...

 Thumb rule for driving habits is like any other car: SOFT. 
If You don앖 treat the clutch gently you are soon going to learn how to :-)
Same thing with the brakes. Be cool as the snow :-)

 After all I belive Your biggest problem is going to be how to stay warm
and cosy in the bus. Are Your heat exchangers working?


Think that압 about it!

 I thought maybe this year I will have to drive my
Westy in the snow.  Is there anything that I should know about driving
in the snow?  Special tires? etc...

Thanks,
