Subject: RE: Piston stuck in caliper

Disclaimer: I have never rebuild a caliper, but I have rebuild numerous
wheel cylinders ...

In my experience the tool of choice for stubbornly seized brake pistons is
your trusty grease gun. Replace the brake line (or bleeder nipple) with a
grease fitting (block the other inlet with a matching screw) and then watch
a few hundred PSI do their magic while you pump your grease gun. You MUST do
this with the caliper secured in a vise in such a way that the vise will
stop the piston once it is free. And then you will have lots of fun removing
ALL the grease from the caliper. Unless you loaded your gun with a brake
assemply lube before. Regular grease and brake fluid are NOT compatible.

This procedure as worked well for me - mostly on 40-50 year old Opel wheel
cylinders.
