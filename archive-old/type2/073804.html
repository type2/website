Subject: Re: RE: [T2] lessons on the aftermarket

Hiya Joe,

I also believe that West Coast Metric is a fine company.  However, some of 
the &quot;gloss&quot; of their image has been tarnished a bit for me.  I purchased 
front door seals for my 1970 Bus from them.  The fit going on was not what I 
had expected.  I had to trim a bit to get the seals to fit.  And, as it 
turned out, the seals were just too big.  That resulted in my doors not 
closing flush with the body.  
Yes, I am aware of the guarantee.  And it's a good one, got my bucks back.  
But it does not solve the problem of what to do for seals.  I either use 
ill-fitting seals or nothing at all.  So I turned to Ron over at BusDepot and 
asked for some advice.  
I learned that WCM's seals (in this particular case) were aftermarket 
Brazillian seals.  Ron sold me genuine VW Brazillian seals and they fit 
perfectly!  Doors are flush and sealed just like new.
Will I buy from WCM again?  Of course.  I have used other seals from them 
(sliding door and rear cargo hatch) and have been very happy.  I simply 
realize that even the best of companies can make unintentional mistakes and 
the old axiom of caveat emptor still rings true.

Mike

ps  by the way, the rear bumper I ordered from you a few months ago was 
Purr-fect!
