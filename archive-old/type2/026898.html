Hi All,
  In response to
        &quot;I was just curious if anyone had any &quot;Duct Tape&quot; type fixes until I 
get up North--Thanks for the help---Adam&quot;

Adam, if the rip is running around a fold of the boot, you can sew it back 
together.  I once did this when I couldn't afford even a new boot.  I used a 
curved needle, and heavy waxed thread(more like light string) that I had 
gotten from an upolstrey shop.  Use the baseball stitch and dont put too 
much tension on the thread.  I seem to remember melting the holes for the 
needle in the boot, but I'm not sure about that.  Anyway, it did last for a 
couple of months.
