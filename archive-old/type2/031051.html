Volks
 
  Had my 2L rebuild back in for 4k miles and running fine, today with no
warning my starter died.  
   Turn the key and the sonoid operates but no spin.
  engine turns freely and had started strongly on the first spin just 20
minutes earlier.
  tried a jump but no difference.
  checked batteries (twin 1000ah) both check out fine
  I have a direct start rear switch, no difference

got her towed home this afternoon (auto tranny, no push start), tommorrow 
I stick a spare starter in her, and check the wiring,

anyone have any other bright ideas or something I missed.

Thanks
Bob
