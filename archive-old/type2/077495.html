&gt;   I just purchased my first bus last night.  Does anyone know where I
&gt; can find a wiring schematic for a 1978 Westfalia?  I also wouldn't mind
&gt; finding out more about how to operate the different appliances and the
&gt; electrical panel.  If someone could point me in the right direction for
&gt; locating this documentation it would be greatly appreciated.

Bentley Manual.  (all others optional)

Bus Depot and Rocky Mountain (and I am sure many others) both carry the
latest edition (B/W wiring diagram) check around and you can sometimes
find a early edition (color wiring diagram)  worth every penny
