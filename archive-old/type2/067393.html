Subject: Sold a bus

Hi folks,

Well I sold my recently acquired '67 westyized sunroof deluxe this morning
(please de-stat me Mr. Kipling).  I've owned this bus for only a few weeks
(oh, all the memories!) and though I had big plans, sudden unpredictable
circumstances made it difficult to keep.  The good news is I haven't sunk
any $$ into it yet, and I did manage to make $200 more than the $500 I paid
for it, so alls well that ends well.  

So the first splitty I owned, I never drove (no engine).  It looks like it
would've been fun to drive--I hear they are.  Splitties are hard to find
around New England.  The ad appeared yesterday, and the guy who was the
first caller came at 7am this morning with the cash.  If I were in
California I'm sure I would've been sitting on this bus for a month or so.
Location location location!
