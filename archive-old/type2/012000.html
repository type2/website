&gt; I have also heard talk of &quot;weekenders&quot; and &quot;hard top&quot; Westphalia

Hey there Volks, 

Most are official Westfalia hard top campers. Some are put together
by PO's. One of the rarer ones is the 76-77 white Non-poptop with the
orange plaid. According to busdepot Ron (see plaid fabric thread in
the archives), not many of these were imported into the US.

Since I'm a single guy, and don't need much room, I've thought buying
a 76-79 hardtop westy. I'm not sure if the hardtops came in both the
standard/weekender (p22 mcode) or deluxe (p27 mcode) version, but
would like to think they did.

On a side note, I'd love to get more info about what model Westfalia
campers (hardtop/poptop, standard/deluxe) came with what interior
plaid/exterior paint color combinations.

An example: The 1979 westy pop-ups came in sage green/green plaid
(p22 standard only) and mexico beige/brown plaid (p27 deluxe only).
Someone correct me if I'm wrong, Karl ??
