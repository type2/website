&gt; In your storage shed, I think that it would be a near ideal solution.  I
&gt; far prefer propane to kerosene, as kerosene has a tendency to stink.
Aye!  'tis correct.  I just spent $29.99 for the 30# bottle, $9.05 for 
propane, and $79.99 for the Mr. Heater brand of dual eye heater.  When I 
went to first fire it up, a burst of quick blue flame singed all the tips 
of my bangs.  Now I have crusty hairs. :-(  Anyway, after I got it going, 
I drug it out the shed and played my guitar and sang for about 30 
minutes.  By the end of the 30 minutes, I was sweating profusely - even 
on the low setting.

Yes, I know there is a problem with the CO build-up but what if one 
cracked some windows and such?  Plus, I am talking about heating only 
while driving around.  I agree though that you would absolutely not run

Heater.
