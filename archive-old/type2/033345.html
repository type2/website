Subject: sooby in a bus...

well in my progress to decide to sell the bus, or put a sooby engine in, i
have not completely decided.  but...a few listees wrote asking about the
radiator problem.  i plan on puting one where an a/c condensor goes under
the floor of a bus.  the radiator would have a temp-controlled fan, so
forced air would only help supplement the cooling of the radiator.  or the
other choice is to put it where the *second* battery would go in the back.
this option allows air to be forced down the *shaft* where the air vents
draw in air as you zip down the road.

thats where i am at so far.  i do want to know tho if anyone knows if i for
SURE need an adapter plate to bolt it in or will it go directly on the
tranny.??

thanks,
