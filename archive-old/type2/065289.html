Subject: Re: ? 82 FI Temp Sensor II Removal

Are you sitting down?  The Temp sensor is threaded into the head.
The straight and skinny.  You might be able to use an easy out if it 
got sheared off.  Both heads are machined the same.  You might be 
able to finagle a way to install a new one (and longer wire) to the 
place where the threads would be on number two cylinder as a 
temporary solution, but it would read slightly different temperature.
Sounds like a PO had problems with it and epoxied it in place.
I can't remember if the hole goes through or bottoms out, but the 
hole is there on the head on the right side &amp; you can check it.  Just 
remembered, the hole on the other side should have a larger than 
normal bolt into it holding on a edge of the tin, so I think that it 
does NOT go through, so leaving the busted on in place is ok.
On the left side sheet metal tin (original location) there
should be a hole through the tin, just a little bit bit off center to 
socket, so you end up pushing the tin against the head to get the 
socket to fit. The tin on the right is already against the head so a 
new sensor should screw right in.  Let me know if I got this right, 
going from year old memory.

A problem is getting the new sensor tight to the head with the wire 
sticking out.  I found a socket that has a hex shape on the OUTSIDE 
to allow the sensor wire to stick through the center and put a wrench 
to the outside of the socket to tighten.

&gt; My question is:  How is this item attached to the head or sheet metal?  I
&gt; looked in the archives, but did not find anything specific, so please
&gt; don't steer me that direction.  8-)  Does it attach to the cooling tin
&gt; somehow, or must I remove the cooling tin and get to the head somehow?
