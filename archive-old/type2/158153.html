Subject: Valve Clearance

HEY,

I was thumbing through my owners manual (it's the original) for my 69 bus and 
in the specs it recommends that the clearance should be .004&quot;.  I have always 
set set to .006&quot; and that this what Bentley's and any other source I have 
ever read.

Does it make that much of a difference?
