&gt; &lt;...huh?? my psi NEVER gets under 37psi even at idle, you mean I have never
&gt; used my oil cooler...&gt; Bob,  37psi_at_ hot idle? Might check your gauge. And
&gt; yes, VW spec for the Single Relief Valve Type2 2.0L is 35-38psi, bypasses
&gt; the oil cooler at higher pressures. If it didn't, bye-bye cooler seals.
&gt; BTW, I don't think even Jake Raby's Bad A$$ Type2's pull 30+psi hot.

&lt;...not always, at idle I lift the relief valve at 65 or so psi and can't
remember it ever being below 40psi no matter what the temp.  now I will
admit when the engine was rebuilt we honed a new oil pump to almost
perfect spec...&gt; I'd still check the calibration on that oil pressure gauge,
Bob.

&lt;...and I had a 71 off the showroom floor...ran it hard and it dropped a rod
at 112k...&gt; Upright Type1 engine vs. Type4 engine. kinda like comparing
apples to bowling balls.

&lt;...just got back from a week long 1,200 mile trip into the Anarondack
mountains in upstate NY, and a long drive down I-95 on the way home from
Boston to Baltimore in about 8 hours, stopped only for gas meet me at
everrybus and look at the guage as I pull in if you don't believe me,
should arrive early afternoon Fri if the auto tranny holds up...&gt; Look
forward to meeting you. I'm the guy with too many tattoos and a Westy with
too many light, and an HDTV antenna bolted to the safari rack.
Have a safe trip amigo,
Robb
