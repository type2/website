Subject: [T2] Sliding door track rusted out

Monday i picked up a 1978 microbus with a 1641cc type 1.  both rocker panels 
are completly rusted out, and the track for the sliding door isnt even there. 
 needless to say the door doesnt work.  i was wondering if anyone has had 
this problem before.  can i buy the track to weld in or can i make something 
my self.  Also were can i buy replacment roacker panels.  thanks
