&gt;Thom, 
&gt;
&gt;Don't even think about changing the CAPACITOR at the bottom of the motor.
&gt; This device is for noise reduction to the rest of the electrical system.  By
&gt;noise reduction I don't mean audible noise, more than I mean frequency.  The
&gt;frequencies generated by the dc brush motors in the fan assembly cause
&gt;&quot;noise&quot; that can mess up something as small as your gas gauge.  this is a .4
&gt;MicroFarrad Capacitor.  And unless your motors don't run, but ohm out ok,
&gt;don't mess with them...
&gt;
&gt;I have restored quite a few ambulance fans (which I do, along with providing
&gt;other VW related services), and have always opted for the voltage drop method
&gt;of installation.  It really is not that bad a thing to install this device
&gt;into your system.  Just make sure that where ever you mount it, that there is
&gt;plenty of circulation or it is fixed firmly to a body panel of some sort, for
&gt;heat dissapation.  Those little buggers get pretty hot under load.  
&gt;
&gt;I suppose if you want to spend more than the fan is worth, you can take the
&gt;motors down to a generator shop or motor manufacturer and have them wind them
&gt;with new wire for 12 volt operation, but the voltage drop is really a safe
&gt;and economic way to go.  
&gt;
&gt;By the way, don't use any sandpaper or other course media on the commutator
&gt;when you clean it up.  Use only Brasso type liquid metal cleaner or a paste
&gt;like semi-chrome polish.  And to ensure long life, take some Q-Tips and
&gt;alocohol and clean the brush material from the recesses in the commutator.
&gt; This buildup of carbon can cause shorts in the motor assemblies, arking of
&gt;power, and reduce the life of the motor.  
&gt;
&gt;Let me know if I can be of any more assistance.
