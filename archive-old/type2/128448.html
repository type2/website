Subject: Re: [T2] Painting wheels with POR

Chris,
If the wheels you had powder coated were prepped right, they should be
showing no signs of rust--
For all the hoopla regarding the advantages this refinishing system, 2
years, and &quot;just showing signs of rust&quot; is no bargain--

And I'm not working you over at all--
I get better results painting semi wheels with straight old enamel.
( no not rattle cans )

The trick without a doubt is the locking down and sealing of the
metal--and this is where most folks cheat--in the prep prior to
refinishing any portion of their vehicle--


I would think that somebody skipped a few processes on your wheels--:&gt;(

Also last night I saw a message regarding a warning about wheels blowing
off at speed due to paint or powder coating preventing the lug nuts from
tightening down.

Hog wash---

Think about this one----

How many new car wheels have you seen with the lug nut holes free of
paint?

Go ahead--take a stroll over to any new car dealer of your choice and
just for grins take a look at the brand new spare tire--
Or better yet--take a look at any alloy wheel--
They are all painted / finished with something-right down to the chamfer
of the lug hole--

I would suspect what we had here in this wheel blowing off happening is
the result of the skinny guy at the beach not cranking down on the lug
wrench quite enough---


Take Care--
