Subject: Re: Catalogs

I can be really short on catalogs: Berg provides the best i've ever seen. Also for Busses.

Lots of Genuine German/Mexican/Brazilian VW parts, they stock enough to build an entirely 
new engine out of genuine VW parts, most of the time you can choose either German or 
Brazilian parts.

I also have Bugpack and Johnny's Speed &amp; Chrome, both nice to have but lots of junk in there,
Wolfburg West, an old JCW, several WCM, RMMW, Parts Place and more, i also have some from 
the UK and Belgium and quite a few from Germany and the Netherlands, still the Berg Catalog is 
the best imho. Even if your only looking for stock parts, i don't see a lot of people recommending/
sharing experiences about Berg parts which i think is odd, also, if you want to know things about 
your VW motor i'd recommend Bob Hoover's sermons and the Gene Berg catalog and Tech article 
books.

Brian.
