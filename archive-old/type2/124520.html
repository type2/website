Subject: [T2] 71 Blown Engine?!?!?

That's what I had to do. You need to determine that that is the problem
first via compression test. In my case, the heads were still good, the
bottom end still good, so I just bought an $85 P/C kit and was back on the
road again.

&gt; OK so what would you suggest........that i put in new
cylinders and pistons........?

&gt; Rus in bartlesville OK
