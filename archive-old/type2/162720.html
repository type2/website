&gt; If a spare has never been mounted on the front of your bus .. I wouldn't do

&gt; sure that at the speed with which I hit him .. if it had not been for the
&gt; spare I would only have had to replace my bumper .. but because of the front
&gt; mounted spare I had to have the whole front clip of my bus replaced.

and the other side of the story, I had a tractor trailer clip me (driver
fell asleep at the wheel) spun me sideways into his trailer, the spare on
the front of my bus hit his wheel and kept me from getting close enough
for the box to actually hit my bus, I was pushed away and had some
relatively minor damage, at 55mph. I think if the spare wasn't there I
would have hit him broadside with the front of the bus since the bumper
would have passed under him....
