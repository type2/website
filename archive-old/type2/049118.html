Subject: [T2] I was telling a friend about all the helpfull . . .

I was telling a friend about all the helpful, friendly people I've run
across on Type2_dot_com's mailing list, and he asked me if I new of a similar
list where he could post a question concerning disk brake conversion on a
'68 beetle.

Does anyone know of a list where he could possibly get some answers to his
questions?  Maybe some of you would like to talk to him &quot;off list&quot;.  His
name is Chris and his e-mail address is fishriot_at_yahoo_dot_com.

Thanks for letting me interrupt the Type 2 discussion for a moment.

David
