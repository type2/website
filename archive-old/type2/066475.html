Subject: Re: Double Cab Snorkel?

&gt;I have this too on my '73 ('74 model) single cab, i also had it on my '78 
&gt;single,
&gt;and i'm pretty sure it's standard on every later baywindow, i dono when VW
&gt;started with this though, i also saw it on my friends '73 (also '74 model) 
&gt;double cab. If you have a 1600 upright engine in it you'll have a plastic
&gt;airfilter housing on the right in the engine compartment, the filter element
&gt;that fits this housing is the same as the one used for dual carb T4 engined 
&gt;Buses, the filter housing is connected via a rubber elbow to the right 
&gt;underbed rail, so this set up is simply the engine's air intake.

Bill didn't have this in his '70 single cab, so we thought it might be 
unique. I'm going to try and post my m codes to the list, and see what 
comes up. It'd be interesting to see your m codes as well Brian (and you 
too Bill) to see if there's any links between them.

I gaze at the brilliant full moon. The same one, I think to myself, at 
which Socrates, Aristotle, and Plato gazed. Suddenly, I imagine they 
appear beside me. I tell Socrates about the national debate over one's 
right to die and wonder at the constancy of the human condition. I tell 
Plato that I live in the country that has come the closest to Utopia, and 
I show him a copy of the Constitution. I tell Aristotle that we have 
found many more than four basic elements and I show him a periodic table. 
I get a box of kitchen matches and strike one. They gasp with wonder. We 
spend the rest of the night lighting farts.
