Subject: STRANGE OCCURANCE

Hello,

I have a 72 van and the other day I was driving along an she was running ok
and then I was stopped at a stop light and she died at the light.I pushed her
off to the side
and she wouldn't even turn over! I checked over the starter wires and they
seemed ok.
I walked to a gas station so I could call for a jump start, just wanted to see
if that would do.
I was waiting impatiently and walked back to the van before help arrived.
I jumped in tried it again and vrroom she started up.Question: does anyone
have any ideas
what happened? or what might cause this strange occurance?
It has started and ran good ever since.

Thanks,
Darren
