&gt; Ok folks
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; Here's one question, I need a computer and don't have a decent laptop. Could
&gt; I run a desktop off a inverter or is that just completely nuts. I would have
&gt; to get an LCD monitor which is fairly low power. If I had anything of a
&gt; budget I'd just get a balls to the walls dell 8600 but that's not an option
&gt; at the moment. Also has someone had experience using a spring pcs phone as a
&gt; wireless modem?
&gt; 

I like the lower wattage of the LCD. You are going to want to consider a 
UPS; an Uninterruptible Power Supply.

Basically it's a big heavy battery you insert between the source of 
power (in this case 12v DC being converted to 110V AC) but it's biggest 
feature in this unit is it's conditioning of the power output.

More than just a spike arrester the input voltage is separate from the 
output voltage. So you should also be safe from brown outs and the 
variabilities of automotive power.

It doesn't really have to a very big unit, your not really trying to 
keep a server up 24/7, rather the (seemingly) primary use of such a unit 
is to provide a few secs/mins of power- enabling a safe 'save your data 
and shut down quick' maneuver.

In any case you can find real cheap (relatively) priced laptops these 
days, if you're  not trying to keep up w/ the Joneses.

I did a Google search and semi decent laptop systems starting around $150.
