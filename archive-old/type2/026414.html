&gt; On my 74 automatic bus, which carb setup would be
&gt; better, the stock dual 32/34 pict SOLEX carbs or a
&gt; 32/36 deav Weber carb. Both setups need some work and
&gt; I don't know which set up would be better. Any
&gt; suggestions would be great!

I replaced the stock setup on my '73 1700 AT with a 32/36 dual progressive
last summer.  The twin carbs I had on there were in dire need of a rebuild,
leaking air here, there and everywhere, adjustment got me nowhere, and I
fancied the simplicity of the single carb.

End results were good -- better mileage (over long distances, mileage around
town is criminal, but I don't drive around town) and a lot better drive.
But I suspect I'd have got as good a deal if I'd rebuilt the carbs I had.

If you intend doing the job and want to save some cash, you don't have to
buy a new Weber DFV -- the DGV, fitted to the 2l Pinto engine (over here
they were fitted to Cortinas and Sierras) is a suitable replacement, if
you're willing to do a bit of improvisation.

I'm in the process of writing up a report, which is complete all bar some
comparative jetting info:

It's in beta at the moment, so if you find any mistakes let me know.

Cheers,

Chris.
