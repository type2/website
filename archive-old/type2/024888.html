Subject: Project Buses for Sale
Message-ID: &lt;949e463a.2440d2a2_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I have 2 project buses for sale.  You could make one good bus out of the 2.

1977 Champagne Edition Station Wagon

Missing middle seat and engine is sitting where the middle seat used to be.
Engine is missing one head and the fan housing, but the FI stuff is still 
there.

Bus is white over brown and has some rust in rear corner.  Overall this is 
pretty solid and restorable.  Has air conditioning and automatic 
transmission.  I have a good title in my name.

1978 Station Wagon (Hawaii Bus)

I believe this one is also a deluxe bus, but has been repainted a couple of 
times and is now a dark gray color.  You could retstore this bus, but my 
guess is that there is a lot of bondo under that grey paint.  PO was in the 
military and had the bus shipped from Hawaii for free.  Also missing middle 
seat.  The engine was running good a couple of years ago when parked.  The 
last time we started it, there was a lot of lifter noise.   My plan was to 
put this engine in the '77 bus, but I'm now loosing my storage space.

This bus also has air conditioning and auto tranny.   I have a signed, but 
unregistered title in the PO's name.

I would like to get $500 for both buses.  I have at least a month or more 
before I have to move these.  If they don't sell in the next few weeks, I'll 
likely have to part them out.  I would then keep the '78 engine and FI, but 
sell everything else.  

Both buses are near St. Louis Missouri.
