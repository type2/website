Subject: Re: [T2] Hidden Stereo

When I bought my '79 it didn't have a stereo mounted and had the original
&quot;panel&quot; covering the hole - basically it's a curved square flap of sheet
metal covered in vinyl.  It has two screws on the bottom corners that go into
the dash --- anyway I thought it would be cool to leave the flap in
place and create a &quot;secret panel&quot; when I installed a stereo.  I put a
piano hinge on the top of the flap and ground off the pointy bits of those
two screws.  Now I simply lift up the panel to turn on the stereo or
change tapes and the flap rests back down again, looking like a dashboard
panel.  Two break-ins and stereo is still there.

Now if I could figure out how to perfect the thief-activated ejector
seat....

&gt; Well as luck would have it (or wouldn't as the case may be) my '78 Westy
&gt; was broken into last night.  The perps jimmied open the passenger wing
&gt; vent, rolled down the window and unlocked the door.  They got an
&gt; inexpensive Kenwood CD deck (which they will have to try and figure out
&gt; the four digit lock code for since they disconnected the power) and two
&gt; Kenwood speakers out of the doors.  Fortunately they were nice enough to
&gt; remove the items cleanly and didn't do any damage to the c&gt;
