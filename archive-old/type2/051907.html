Subject: Re: [T2] Engine removal info

[...]

Once upon a time I sketched out a rig to do just that.  I was thinking type
1 and early [twin carb] type 4 engines.

The idea was to fabricate a pair of A-frame legs that would rest [with the
battery removed] on the &quot;shelves&quot; on either side of the engine and support a
cross-beam.

A compact hoist hung from the cross-beam would support the engine using soft
nylon slings.

With everything unbolted the engine assembly could then be lowered to a skid
or pallet on the floor.  Reinstallation would be the reverse, etc.,
etc.,.....

This was all on paper, and looked to be workable.  In retrospect, I think a
hoist would occupy too much vertical space to be usable.

An alternative would be to simply route a stout lifting line or strap over
the top of the cross-beam from the slings, out the back to an anchor point
with a single block, then  back forward to an anchor point.  With the
friction and the mechanical advantage from the block it should be easy to
control the engine's descent.

Raising the engine back into place would be a tad more difficult, but still
doable working solo.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  I have an early bay so I might be blowing smoke, but is it possible to
use a hoist from above through the hatch to lower the engine onto a sheet
of plywood or cardboard?  It seems as if this would eliminate the need to
lift the bus high enough to clear both jack and engine.  &lt;&lt;
