Subject: Sliding Door Latch

Hello,
     I went to go and open my sliding door and the
latching mechanism doesn't work anymore.  What's
happening is......when I turn the handle for the door,
the latch doesn't move, so it won't shut.  Does anyone
know what to do here?  I can't seem to even get the
latch apart.  Thanks a lot.

Tim
