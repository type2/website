To all.

Pack up the bus, check the valves and hit the road!

May 15th and 16th at Hagan-Stone Park (The site of the now infamous EveryBus
Campout)  in Pleasant Garden, NC will be the location for the second annual
Pickin' in Park. This is a locally organized event of Bluegrass workshops
and performances that will take place over the weekend. If you would like to
attend and camp you can call the park at 336-674-0472 and reserve a
campsite(ignore the message about reservations for 6 or more sites). Camping
is $12.00 a night and that includes hookups and a picnic table. There is no
admission fee to the event itself.

I am not affiliated with the event but plan on camping out  and having some
fun.

If you are planning on attending and need more info please p-mail me. I will
scrape up what I can:)&gt;
