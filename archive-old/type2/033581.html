Subject: Facet pumps

If a low pressure electric fuel pump is noisy, its because it is starving for
fuel and it is probably mounted to the firewall.  I wouldn't go to the trouble
of using rabbit radiator mounts, but i will use some rubber bushings of some
kind. If one of these square 'facet' style pumps is mounted metal to metal on
the firewall of a bus, then it will rattle pretty loud before it is pulling
its full capacity and even during normal operation it will run low and start
clattering sometimes.  
I think this has to do whith electric pumps in general being fuel 'pusher'
rather than 'puller' pumps; The pump will perform better (not starve, not
rattle) if it is closer to the fuel source (under the tank)- plus - if you
mount it to the frame on rubber, you won't hear it even if it does clatter. 
Could be a down side there (not hearing it), but if it fails completely,
you'll know.

If all the other systems on the bus are 'up to snuff' then it is a pretty
quiet engine - especially the type4, but if a listee has a problem or is
asking a question about a noisy fuel pump in a bus, then they probably do own
a volkswagen (namely the bus with the noisy fuel pump) and is on their way to
being a mechanic - like it or not, you're gonna learn how to do something.

Don't go as far as the two grand for the 15-drawer rolling tool box setup just
yet, but you might as well go ahead and invest in that set of coveralls...
