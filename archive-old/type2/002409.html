Subject: Under windshield repair

I removed the windshield on my 71Westy. The whole portion of metal that was
covered by the rubber is rusted beyond repair. I want to replace this
portion but haven't been able to find a source for this replacement
panel(Not the whole nose, just the portion from the &quot;bulge&quot; up). Does
anybody knows of a source? Any suggestions, tips on how to  this project?  I
will to hear from people who has done this repair. Best regards

Victor
