Subject: RE: Oil Sensor Wiring Help

The piece of plastic is not important.  In my '78 2.0 L it is just a cover
for a connector.  If you yank on one end or another one of the connectors
will pop free.  If the two metal connectors weren't covered, they could
inadvertently ground against something in the engine compartment and cause
the light to come on when in fact there's nothing wrong.  Cutting it out of
the circuit is no big deal, it just means that next time you replace your
oil pressure sender you'll have to cut the wire.  And also, to ensure it
doesn't accidentaly ground, put some shrink tubing over the connection.

&gt;&gt;My oil light would not turn on today during my start up routine.  When I
got to the back to check the oil sensor, I found that the wire and
broken.  Looking around the engine compartment for the other &quot;half&quot;, I
found only one &quot;wire&quot; to reconnect to.

However, this is where I am confused.  It looks like it doesn't really
connect to a wire, but a small rectangular piece of plastic with wire
running thru it.  The plastic piece is about 1 1/2 inches long with a VW
logo at one end, the word weco at the other end and the numbers 440 in
the middle.

Is this plastic piece important or can I just cut it out of the loop and
reconnect the wires on either side?  The wire snapped right at the edge,
so if it is a resistor or something, I will have to get new one.

This is a 1976 FI Engine that was rebuilt professionally by a reputable
local garage.  I haven't had to do to much besides the regular
maintenance on it, so any help is appreciated.

Thanks,
