Nisha:
Go to www.type2_dot_com and look through the library and archives.
Get a copy of John Muir's &quot;How to Keep Your VW Alive&quot; and
the appropriate shop manual from Bentley Publishing.
Good luck

Subject: [T2] new vs old


&gt; Hi
&gt;     We just got our 76 bus and need to do some work but know nothing
&gt; about anything. I saw the question about new vs old parts and was
&gt; wondering the same thing. Are the new parts no good or just more
&gt; expensive? Also what would be the best book  or resource to get if you
&gt; are just starting out?
&gt; 
&gt;     a very curious beginner ..nisha
