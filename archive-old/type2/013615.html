Hi All,

I'm looking for a referral for a welder (or a listee?) who would weld-up the light/medium rust under my windshield. I fixed her myself about four years ago with the help of some body filler and of course the rust is back. This time I want to fix her right. There are some holes, but nothing gaping and big so this should not be a job that requires a replacement panel.

Any direction would be appreciated.

Thanks as always,

Mark
