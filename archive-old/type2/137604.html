Very true.  But I have to laugh, as the person who inspired this 
transgression.  The only reason that I added a .sig to my post was to make 
sure that my reply was long enough WRT to the quoted material from the

for including too much quoted material :-)

Bus Content:  Wish me luck, tomorrow I head to Maryland, which will 
complete my cross country bus journey.  5 days of driving over 13 months 
:-)  (I brought the bus to Chicago from CA over 3 days last November).
