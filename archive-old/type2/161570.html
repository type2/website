Subject: Seeking good used 1978 2 litre engine in MD.

       A good friend of mine threw a rod and hosed up their engine pretty 
bad (case damage).  They are a nice family.  At this point to minimize 
downtime and cost I am trying to help them find a decent used 2 litre engine 
to replace theirs.  A longblock would be fine, I can help them with removal, 
prepping the block, and installation.  I just figured I'd send out a request 
and see if anybody has anything (prefferably in the area, DC, VA, MD, DE, PA 
but can figure something out) that would work for them.
      This would be going into a 1978 transporter which at this time is 
pretty much original as far as the engine and fuel injection goes.  Would 
like to get close to that to minimize trouble in replacing it.
      If you have something please PM me the cost, information, and 
location.

Thanks!
