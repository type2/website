Subject: RE: [T2] 'Remanufactured by Bosch' Alternator

Have them tested at Advance when you buy. I used to sell their parts. Many arrive dead out of the box. Nothing like selling a customer a starter that is a pain in the rear to install and only then does he realize the new one is junk and dead just like the old one... Remove and return to the store for ANOTHER starter... 3 starter swaps versus just 1. 

I saw a good number of parts from AA die 2-3 years after purchased b/c I think they don't expect you to keep a car more than 1-2 year more when you replace this. The lowest price parts are the worst. They (at the time) took apart a starter or generator and replaced whatever (and ONLY) what is wornout or suspect. Profit margin on a knife edge I'd guess. Means you get a rebuilt without all the rebuilt parts you expect - like bearings, like brushes, etc. May only be as good as the rebuilt I did years ago in my driveway for $3 b/c I was force to decide between pizza and beer or transportation so I replaced JUST what was broken. 1 new part in an old starter... 

For certain REALLY commonc cars (engines like the small block Chevy) they had a basic, medium and top quality. Basic I described above, then the medium was all new parts of dubious quality, and the top quality was something like the AC Delco who I was told didn't do the rebuild, just licensed out their name to a rebuilder. I never saw it in writing so take that with a grain of salt. 

The other problem is the quality of their replacement components. Are the brushes good brushes or Chinese brushes? Are the new bearings good bearings or crummy?

Shop around and compare the cost to NAPA or another FLAPS. I WON'T buy ANYTHING from AA except batteries (are/were GNB which everyone sells, and never had problems with them) and brand name items. Their cheap rebuilt items, and their electrical components are scary quality. Hit or miss. I'd trust their Bosch O2 sensors b/c it is the same one everyone sells. I trust their Bendix brake parts. I don't trust their white box (no-name with store sticker stuck on it) items... Chinese quality or worse... 

I buy O'Reilly or NAPA these days mostly. AZ and AA in a pinch. I figure the OEM part last 20 years and 150K miles, so I want the replacement to come close. My time is worth something too. 

Quickie story: put my Corvair engine into my VW bus. Took the starter apart, inspected all of it, cleaned, greased, and painted it all. Worked 1st time falwlessly. No new parts, starter is original factory starter from 1965 and had not been used since the early 80's. Just a good basic starter and my &quot;clean up&quot; job didn't hurt.
