&lt;&lt; Minor correction - I believe the 4.86 is the '74 ratio (34/7).  The 
'76  should have 32/7 or 4.57 final drive. &gt;&gt;

David is correct in that the 1st generation 091s (1976-1979) should
have a 4.57 ring and pinion set.  The '74s that I have cracked all 
have had either a 8 tooth 5.375 set or a 7 tooth 5.425 set.  The 
one year only 1975 002 transaxle did come with a 4.86 set from 
the factory.  I must have these on the brain as I have just done
5 in a row!

&lt;&lt; I would really think about not doing this since the motor will 
have a hard time pushing the bus to this speed at only 3000 rpm, 
not  to mention that the gap from 3rd to 4th will be huge with the 
.70 ratio -  you will be pulling the slightest hills (or level ground 
with a headwind)  at 55mph in 3rd. &gt;&gt;

Again, dead on.  The original question was for the 'tallest' gear
and thats what I answered.   I do something similar to this for
the split window Bus owners in which I replace the original ring 
and pinion (either a 4.375 or a 4.125) with a post-'73 3.875 set
from a Beetle.  This allows them to cruise at around 60-65 mph
at 3,000-3250 rpms and not get run over on the freeway.  Some
owners with less than fresh single port 1600cc engines state
that they have to downshift a bit more when going up hills but 
that it drops right into the middle of the power band for 3rd gear.
The stock 4.57 with the stock 4th (.82) and a 27&quot; tire at 3250 
rpm is propelling the Bus down the highway at almost 70mph.
You might consider the .77 after-market 4th but why?  It seems
to me that the stock gearing in this case is right where it needs
to be for the best fan speed for cooling and a nice vehicle cruise
speed.

PS- Just read James Weller's post in which he states that he
is running a 1.8 Subaru Turbo.  To directly answer his question
he has the 'tallest' ring and pinion ratio and 4th gear already in
his 091 gearbox.  Thats it for stock ratios-the only thing left is
to change 3rd and 4th to some after-market set.  Speed costs
money, how fast do you want to go?
