Subject: Re: dual hose dist.

Ok, here's the deal. Yes, Steve, tchnically  if you GUN timed ( the book does 
not call out static setting for dual hose) at 5 atdc, then pulled the hose 
off, that would be the correct setting. However, the reta rd also gives some 
nice, off the line, bottom end pull( I actually run these and like them), so 
there really isn't any reason to run it withthe retard disconnected.If you 
want to run one hose, use a 73-74  dist with only the vacuum aqdvance, no 
retard, which is to be set at 7.5btdc GUN. These also run nice on a stock dp, 
but the dual hose has better bottom end.    ED
