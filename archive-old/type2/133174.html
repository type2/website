Subject: Re: [T2] Front Brake Pads

Ted,

Ummm...might I respectfully point out that it isn't about the
rotors lasting longer....it's about you and your families' safety.
Thinks about the price difference between &quot;merely good&quot; and &quot;great&quot; on 
such an item....


Ok safety stuff out of the way&lt;grin&gt;..

I re-did all of 78 brakes with parts from BD including the calipers and 
rotors and pads.  They work great, bus stops practically on a dime.

A buddy who carefully drove it to the Eureka Springs show and back for 
me(I was in a different vw) had a chance to find out when  dog wandered into the road
on the way back...he had seen me flash my brake lights and so was very 
alert, but he said the bus stopping was incredible.  He drives a bug with 4 
wheel disc brakes, so he is used to good stopping.  

He said he never would have believed the bus would stop so well and in 
such a straight line....he missed the dog BTW!

So the answer is...Pagid is very good for me.

Cheers, dave

&gt; I am doing some brake work on Possum. Replacing the master cylinder and all hoses. 
I replaced the front pads about 8k back when I also did the rear shoes and wheel cylinders. 
I used some cheap pads from FLAPS.

. I dont
&gt;  mind replacing pads every 8-10k if it means my rotors stay true longer, 
but maybe there is a better solution...
