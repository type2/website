Subject: Re: Whirring noise in back

&gt;  Maybe more of a purr than a whirr? Not quite  but close to the sound
&gt; of an air compressor running in the distance but a little faster. It makes
&gt; the noise in both acc. and run if that helps.

electric fuel pump??
My engine makes a sucking sound, through the carb.  I have no idea why, but its
been doing it for a while. I see no performance changes or temp changes or
anything.  It just makes a sucking whirring sound that I can hear all the way up
front...and my bus is insulated!
Maybe thats your cause?
