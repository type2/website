Greetings all!

I have a question.  The timer on the auxillary battery charging system has
stopped working.  Could it be from lack of use or too much use?  Has anyone
ever had this problem?  I thought about taking it out to lubricate it.  Any
suggestions?

Also,  if anyone is looking for a VW Rabbit pickup, I have an uncle who is
selling one.  Please e-mail privately if interested.

Thanks,
Victor
