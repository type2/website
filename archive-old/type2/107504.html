Subject: update on the carb/timing issue

Thanks to all who responded and made suggestions. Much of what was suggested
(valves and such) had been done before we started the engine, but it was
good to hear all of it again; it will give me a good starting point if she
ever, goddess forbid, starts acting real funky and not idling again.

My housemate had been insistent that she could get it to idle by messing
about with the carburetor. As she is the senior mechanic between us, I had
been letting her run the show when it came to this issue. But, I quietly
disagreed with her approach, no matter how much I respected her opinion (it
was going nowhere), and took action by subscribing to this list and posting.
What I got, from most of you, was a confirmation that we should probably be
attacking it from another angle.

So, while she was at work yesterday, I made my debut on this problem. What I
found, and continued to find once she arrived home arrived home, was that it
was no one problem, but several.

For starters, I found that vacuum leak -- which turned out to be an old,
torn gasket between the throat and the main chamber of the carb. Easy fix:
make a new gasket with high-temp gasket paper. Done.

Then I took her back to TDC. When I opened her distributor, I found that she
was WAY off where she needed to be. My buddy and I had done this correctly,
we were certain, but who the heck knows what can happen when you have three
people working on a vehicle over a period of many weeks? I have my
suspicions on this, but I will blame no one. Further examination revealed
that her points were angled correctly but not gapped right. There was also a
lack of good lubrication on the shaft, creating some friction and drag. All
are now made better.

The real jackpot was taking that choke apart. There was no tension in it, as
it had not been wound into place. This is one of those things where, since I
bought this vehicle no-op with a rebuilt bloc and about five boxes of
unlabeled parts sitting inside her cabin, and I had found a receipt in there
for a rebuilt Solex 34 PICT-4 carb, we had -assumed- that the carb was fine
and dandy and just slapped it in. After going through our paces with this
thing, though, wonky gasket and unwound choke and all, I can safely say that
her previous owner (who started this project and was intending to rebuild
her, but did not finish) got taken for a ride: that thing was NOT rebuilt,
just lightly cleaned. Between the
distributor and the choke, it' no wonder she wouldn't idle.

As for the oil coming in at the top, it's not as bad as I first thought. I
have no mark on the inside of my filter canister, but I filled it to specs
by measuring. It shouldn't have been overfilled. Both the presence and color
of the oil clued me in to what is likely to be the culprit, though. That was
brand new 30W I put in, and it was BLACK coming out of there. I had figured
at the time I put that assembly together that there must be some way to
clean the top part, but didn't know how, so I didn't do it. (My Chilton's is
not very helpful about things like this.) It may be that it is sucking in a
little oil because it is pulling too hard through a VERY dirty filter. It is
also likely that, while all those parts were in those boxes, that the filter
was inverted and got oil in it. (Oil in, oil out.)

I read an article just now that recommends soaking the top part in TSP and
then kerosene. I'm thinking that Simple Green, my favorite degreaser, may
work nicely. (Do you soak the WHOLE top part, or just the filter part of the
top part?) I'd like to hear back on this before I proceed.

We've got her going now and are still doing the fine-tuning on her; I'm
going to wait on doing anything more with adjustments until I clean and dry
that air filter this morning, as it should make a good bit of difference for
her to be pulling in clean air with a lot less resistance. I think she is
going to be fine for road testing and new tires tomorrow or Monday and will
be fine for the coming trip to Burning Man. (Though that's not going to stop
me from schlepping along another new belt, an extra set of points, a new
starter, a fresh set of plugs, tons of oil, and most every tool that I own
when we take off on the 25th.)

Thanks Again!
