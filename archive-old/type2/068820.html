All this polite conversing about the beauty or potential beauty of our busi
reminds me of something Bob Hoover once told me when all us &quot;old-timers&quot;
were still on the Vanagon list (okay, so I'm really an old-timer-wannabe).

Paraphrasing: 'Remember that there are lots of different personalities out
there. The ONLY thing we all have in common is our interest in old
Volkswagen buses.'

Personally, I took my old '71 from butt-ugly to pretty nice looking in about
a year. My current bus is a '67 that's parked far away in the foothills of
Arkansas. She's got a lot of potential. I'll drive her and enjoy her and
make her better as I can. I don't have a pocket full of money; I have 3 kids
and a wonderful wife that mean much more than my bus; I have a life that I
need to live. God/Allah/Budda bless you if you have a really nice bus and
keep it that way. I hope you'll all remember, though, that we really do only
have one common interest and if there's 700 of us out there, we've probably
got 700 different situations and at least 710 different personalities.

Have fun! Joe
