Ian-
Stay the hell away from anything GEX has touched. They are bad news
and they sell garbage, because that's the way they build it. I have
yet to hear one good dealing anyone has had with their outfit. I
learned about them with my *NEW* '80 Westy. Bought it in Oregon, drove
out to Grand Jct. and down to Tucson, where the engine quit. Went to a
VW shop(no longer in business) to have it rebuilt. He sold me on
buying a motor from this big outfit in CA, GEX. Yada, yada, yada... I
bought it, he installed it, I got to about Marana(approx.50 miles)it
quit.I fought with GEX, next engine made it to Phoenix. I threatened
GEX, third Engine made it to the AZ/CA border. At this point GEX told
me to piss off, I canceled payment(one good thing about AMEX), towed
it back to my in-laws south of Tucson, bought a book(Chilton's I
think) and rebuilt it. That was my first type 4 engine experience. Ran
fine after that. BTW, Barney's Imports bent over backwards to match
and beat anyones prices for me.  I was broke at that point, had to
sell it to get back to Oregon. Oh well, next Vanagon style Westy will
have water coursing through it's veins. It's an awfully heavy vehicle
for an aircooled, IMHO.
Well, to make a short story long... Don't trust the bottom end of this
engine, it is probably as good as the top. If you can get the van for
a song, drop someone else motor in it.. heck drop a subaru in it. 
JUST DON&quot;T DROP ANY MONEY INTO ANYTHING THAT HAS GEX ON IT.
Peace,
   -Kent (from Ned.)
