Subject: Re: Wood interior

OK, with all the banter about wood interiors,
I'm prompted to relate my experiences redoing
the panels on my '70 bus the winter before 
last.

For wood, I used 3/16&quot; walnut veneer plywood,
which I picked up at a supply house in Eugene,
OR.  Using the old panels for templates, I cut
the wood panels about 1/8&quot;-1/4&quot; smaller than
the originals.  After finishing the panels, I 
wrapped the edges with vinyl to make a nice
edge.  To fasten the panels to the doors, I 
used sheet metal screws and plastic caps, 
which I painted brown to match the vinyl.
I used scrap pieces of hardware to carve
various handles and pulls, which I bolted
to the door metal (this really cinches the
panel to the door and takes the burden off
the screws.

The job wasn't especially hard, but it was
tedious, like anything aftermarket.  If
anyone has any questions, I'd be glad to 
address them offline.

For pictures of the completed job:
