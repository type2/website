Subject: Blowby blowing out dipstick?

Hi all,

So I just had my engine out to replace heads and the rings looked great,
so we put it back just like it was. Then I'm noticing a lot of oil blowing
around in the fan housing. Checked rear main oil seal, which was fine.
Noticed the plastic part of the oil filled spout wasn't pushed securely
down over the flange and I was probably leaking from there, geting sucked
into the fan, and blown all over. Fixed that, but still some leaking in
the rear somewhere. Now the dipstick seems to get blown up (but not out),
epecially when I'm running hard when I can actually hear it rattling
around from the driver's seat. My consulting mechanic says I've got some
blowby generating crankcase pressure that's doing it. But I did a (fairly)
recent compression test and all cylinders were &gt;125psi. He says I've got
the beginnings of a ring leak that isn't enough to show in a compression
test but would probably show in a leakdown test, which I don't even know
how to do.  Sounds like a bad thing. But no low compression symptoms? Hmm...

BTW, the big hose off the crankcase rebreather back to the air intake has 
always been a little too soft to avoid kinking where it makes the turn. 
Could this be the real source of my problem? It's been like that for 
25,000 miles and this seems like a recent problem, so I'm skeptical that 
the old hose is the cause of the new symptom. But it would be easy enough 
(I guess) to find stiffer hose of the same diameter and swap it out. That 
rebreather hose is supposed to handle any crankcase fumes and ought to 
deal with blowby up to a point. It's easy to imagine the kink might be 
obstructing the return flow.

Anyone had troubles like these before? Anyone got any insight here? 
Please advise.

Thanks for your help,
