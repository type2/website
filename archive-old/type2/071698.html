Subject: Clutch release bearing shaft return spring?

I've finally gotten around to putting the transaxle back in my &quot;new 83&quot;.

My question:  Is there a return spring on the release bearing shaft 
on hydralic models?

This one has none. I can't see one on my 87.  Bentley shows none (but 
that does not always mean anything). My 77 manual clutch does.  Is 
this the correct situation for a 83 hydralic?  If so what returns the 
release bearing after engagement?  Does it just stay in contact and 
wear the bearing?

Thanks

Steve

By the way,  I welded the  slave unit attachement bolt to the bracket 
so it wouldn't be such a bitch to re-attach the slave unit. (If 
you've replaced a slave you know what I mean).
