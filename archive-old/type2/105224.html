&gt; &gt; Overheating the oil breaks down the oil. If you change the oil, you won't

&gt;
&gt;Interesting point.  Is there a way to gauge how much your oil has &quot;broken
&gt;down&quot; or does this presumably just manifest itself as dirty oil that feels
&gt;gritty and/or does not feel like it has the same lubrication properties as
&gt;new oil when you rub it between your fingers?

Precisely. Oil that has been overheated will be darker due to carbon 
loading and thinner due to polymer breakdown. It will also smell different 
than fresh oil. I suspect it would also taste different, though I have 
never developed this skill. You might even try putting some on an anvil and 
hitting it with a hammer to see if it sounds different. In every case, you 
are looking to prove a change via empirical evidence. It is simply 
application of scientific method, as opposed to various forms of guessing 
or assumptions.
