Hi volks,

Shawn writes:

&gt;      I just got a set of Vanagon alloy wheels(Thanks, Steve), so now I
&gt; need some longer wheel studs, off of a vanagon, So Does anyone have any
&gt; laying around they want to part with? Hay Ron(bus depot) do you have any
&gt; new? Nikki have you came across any in your finds? 

 The front studs are 10mm longer than the rears, so if you only need
a little more length then you can re-use them.

 The fronts are 45mm, the rears 35mm. Vanagons (as Karl points out)
had bolts at the front so they don't have long front studs.

 I ended up buying them from an aftermarket wheel supplier here in
the UK. The only source I know of in the US is the Porsche specialist
Pelican Parts (good website), they have a range of different lengths
and I think (ie I don't know for sure) that they are the same profile
as VW ones but the price adds up if you need to buy 10-20. Worth 
getting a couple to check first, perhaps?

 Good luck.

Cheers,
	  W.
