&gt; If in fact you guys are looking for a relay set up I have dual 40 amp

&gt; The existing fuses in the fuse box will take care of any problems, if
&gt; they do arise.

This will work, and will save the switch, but the voltage delivered to the
lights will be less than if you run a separate power wire from the battery
to the relay.  The most convienent place to tap power from the battery
for high current applications is at the large terminal on the starter.

I've found that the VW fuses are another weak link in the electrics.  The
holders get weak and corroded which can be a problem for high current
circuits like headlights.
