Subject: poptop seals

73 Westy- poptop action.....
I got 2 seals from  Bus Depot.
1 is for all around 
1 is for between poptop and luggage rack (it's like a flap)
There IS enough of the all around seal to go between poptop and luggage rack.
*Do I wrap the all around one between poptop and luggage rack AND use the &quot;flap&quot; seal?
*Do I wrap the all around one between poptop and luggage rack and NOT use the &quot;flap?&quot;
*Do I cut the all around seal at the bottom horizontal edge and use the &quot;flap&quot; seal for between poptop and luggage rack?
 
please help, I'm confused!
thanks, Chris
