Subject: Re: [T2] shifting

[...]
what you are describing is most likely a  loose shift setup.  check all 
of the bushings and adjustments.  especially check all the areas that 
have set screws.

&gt; Just recently bought a 72 van. Everything looks really old, like no

&gt; What I need help in is determining the cause of shifting problems.
&gt; At first I could reverse and shift quite easily.Now after about 3 weeks 
&gt; it is hard to shift down from 3rd to
&gt; 2nd and 2nd to 1st. Going from 3rd to 4th no problem but reverse I cant 
&gt; find.
&gt; Is this the whole transmission or just the solenoid that needs 
&gt; replacing?
&gt; I also heard about those shifting couplers, can these cause this 
&gt; problem.
