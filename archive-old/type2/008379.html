I think many people are on a red herring here. Does your van have 2
batteries, a normal one and a leisure battery? Because mine does, and I've
found that due to the deep-cycling nature of the leisure battery, in
certain situations, the leisure battery will not get charged properly.

It goes like this: batteries ideally would produce 12V all the time until
they are completely flat, when the voltage would magically go from 12V to
0V. However, we all know this isn't true as a nearly-flat battery will
produce, say, 3 volts or so. Also, the fully charged voltage is nearer 14V.
The deep-cycling leisure battery will produce a greater voltage at a
similarly flat (as in remaining Amp-hours) state, and a lesser voltage at
a charged state.

What can happen is at, say, both batteries half-capacity, the voltage of the
leisure battery will be higher than the car battery. With both batteries
fully charged, the car battery produces the higher voltage. One could draw
curves of voltage against capacity, and see that the leisure and car battery
have quite different characteristics.

Now, when the 2 batteries are at the same voltage level, they could be at
quite different capacities of charge. Then what happens (with the average
charging system) is that at for example car battery 3/4 charged and leisure
battery 1/4 charged, they have the same voltage. When the engine is running
the alternator/regulator puts out a slightly higher voltage in order to allow
current to flow from it to the batteries. All this goes to the leisure battery
and charges it instead of your car battery. The end result is that the car
battery never gets properly charged and hence problems arise.

I've recently had this problem when I didn't use the van regularly and both
batteries went flat; then I charged both up and now I'm fine; well sort of,
the leisure battery is so big that my ickle trickle charger takes days to
do that.......

PS My next van is going to have a much more complicated split-charging
system with an ammeter to see what's going where...

RE:	Battery drain...

Hello, all:
I've stumbled on a most frustrating problem.
My battery (78 westy) is new, as in bought three months ago from NAPA, but
persists in losing its charge after a week or so. I've pulled it and had it
tested *twice*, and it's checked out great both times. I also pulled the
alternator and had that tested, and it too has come up fine on a bench
test. So I replaced the regulator (grasping at straws after two months of
push starting and booster cables) with a brand new one.
Still, I'm drained.
