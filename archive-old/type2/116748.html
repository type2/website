Subject: hesitation or surge update

On a side note, I have noticed that it only does this while at cruzing 
speeds. If I put the hammer down, it will not hesitate or surge at all, 
until I let up off of the gas and try to maintain pretty much any speed.
Its a 2.0, fuel injected.

thoughts?

Best,
Christopher
