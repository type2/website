&gt; Maybe that accessory socket was used for a:

&gt; electric bud vase

&gt; any other suggestions ?

Well, if you go to your BMW motorcycle dealer you can buy various
electrically warmed garments that have plugs compatible with that socket.

Also, IIRC, you can get plugs and sockets more cheaply (than BMW
Motorcycle dealers charge, at least) at your local John Deere dealer.
