Subject: Re: [T2] westy vs. campmobile question

&gt; --Well what about the original question, and the since added one:
&gt;
&gt; Did Westfalia/Riviera make non-popping conversions?
&gt;

I can't speak to Riviera, but Westfalia sure did.  They don't seem to be
that common but Dolan had a '76 hardtop Westy for some time.  The pop-top
was optional equipment.
