Subject: RE: [T2] Hybridizing the T2 (was Annual smog checks)

I was just talking about this to my tuner friend about this exact topic. On
a carbureted vehicle, efficiency is indeed about 15% and climbs a little
with a carb equipped egr system. A modern EFI systems easily doubles that.
Motors get even more efficient when you talk about newer direct injection
systems with dual plugs and variable valve timing. Add turbo-charging,
premium fuels and other gadgets and it gets better.

At least mileage for newer vehicles remains steady instead of going down,
even with engine technology gaining ground. This is because cars are getting
porkier and porkier with heavy AWD and safety systems dragging them down.
Example, the GVWR of a '08 GMC Yukon Denali is 7400lbs, it has standard AWD
and they are getting 13/19mpg out of it! Honestly that is pretty impressive
from a 6.2L V8 with 380hp/417 lb/ft of torque pushing a virtual brick
through the air.

Not that I would be caught dead owning one unless it ran on greasel and was
shaped like a bus...wait isn't that an '82/'83 Vanagon? :)

Only ?%15? of the available energy in the gasoline is utilized, the other
85% gets spit out the exhaust pipe.
