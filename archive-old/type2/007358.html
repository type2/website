When you say bushing, do you mean the 2x rubber bushes at the gearbox end of the
shift linkage? Or any other rubber bits at the front?

I was at first going to say the bushes at the rear have worn, thus not moving the
shift selector on the gearbox (enough) when you move the gear lever. Or have they
been fitted wrongly, and worked loose then fell off? (sounds silly but it's
happened to me, twice).

If that bushing is okay, then my only other suggestion is that the new alignments,
etc. mean that the gear lever is now incorrectly adjusted, so that you can get
reverse but the forward gears are difficult. What actually happens (and it's
difficult to explain without a diagram) is that 1st/2nd are no longer next to the
stop plate for reverse, but slightly to the right. You can select them, but its
just your common sense saying &quot;they shouldn't be in the middle of the selection
area&quot;. Similarly, 3rd/4th may be in an unusual position. Your brain/hand tends to
go on auto pilot and (correctly) works out that 2nd is 8&quot; behind 1st, and that
3rd is 3&quot; to the right of 1st (if you understand me). Hence, you can select okay
when progressing through the forward speeds, but not from reverse.

I don't know if this mail is helpful to you (it's almost like I'm saying &quot;You're
doing it wrong&quot;) but I hope that's the problem here, otherwise it sounds like a
much more difficult/expensive problem!

PS You DO have the stop-plate for reverse the right way round? If you don't know
which way is correct (the Haynes manual has a picture) pmail me and I'll scan you
a diagram.
