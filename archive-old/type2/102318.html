&gt;will get an excellent seal with this technique. A carbon buildup occurs at
&gt;the step which helps to create the seal.

Interesting, I hadn't considered that.  But wouldn't the carbon buildup be disturbed by any movement of the head vs. cylinder, including thermal expansion?  They are different metals.

&gt;Raising the CR might well make the engine run cooler. The stock CR on a late
&gt;bay bus was way low by any standard, but that is another story altogether.

There is another issue.  There needs to be a minimum deck height of something like 0.035&quot;.  In the two engines I have personally rebuilt, the deck height was only about 0.025&quot; without the &quot;head gasket&quot;.  So I would say that a shim should always be installed under the barrel to make up for the thickness of the head gasket unless deck height is re-evaluated.

&gt;Copper sealing rings will make a good seal, so
&gt;if you want to use sealing rings in the heads, get copper ones, which are
&gt;available. 

I would love to have these, but have not noticed them at the usual sources.  Mind sharing where you found them?

Thanks,
        -David
