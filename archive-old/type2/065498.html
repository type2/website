Subject: Width of type 2s

Didn't realy want to get involved with this but my info says

1979 is 1.6 inches wider than 1978. 
This could be due to different rear wheel arch flarings. I've seen both types 
(even on one bus) but never associated it with vehicle age. The repair pannels 
availlable over here all have the wider flaring and thats whats on my bus and 
I think I had the less flared with the squarer edge before. The difference 
could easily be 0.8 inches per side. But it is almost certainly the widest 
point of the vehicle (wing mirrors excepted).

The 1980 Vanagon was 4.9 inches wider (wider than a '78 or '79? who knows)
