Subject: Westy tank color

Howdy,
The propane tank on my 78 westy is in need of a fresh paint job to
inhibit rust. I looked at the manual for the tank delivered with the
westy from the dealership, but no mention of appropriate paint color or
type. It looks like flat gray, but who knows after 23 years ( I am the
second owner, so I didn't see it when new).
Anyone know the factory color?
Anyone paint the tank a different color?
If so, how did it look?
Any other thoughts on the subject?

....a trivial matter to be sure, but your help is appreciated!

Kindest Regards,
Chris
