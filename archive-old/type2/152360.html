&gt; Just thought I'd add my 2 cents on this air tool thread.
&gt; I dislike air tools because the hose is always getting in the way.
&gt; Electric tools aren't much better.  It seems the electric chords are always
&gt; coming apart.
&gt; Battery tools are the pits.  The battery ALWAYS dies at the worst time.
&gt; And hand tools, well, they're just too much work, plain and simple!
&gt;
&gt;    And telekinetic tools just give me a headache...
