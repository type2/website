Subject: [T2] URGENT! What crank to use?

HELP!!!!

I am in the process of building a 1776 upright engine for my bus, I'm not
going to race but I need a grunty engine &amp; my right foot can be heavy. Not
going to see 5000 rpm often if ever! I have a very good case that has been
line bored 1mm &amp; 1mm on the thrust. It has also been worked for 90.5mm
pistons &amp; barrels.

The urgent thing is that I am going to the last show this year in the UK on
Sunday (Friday eve now) &amp; want to pick up a crank while I'm there. My
choices are these:-

1/ New stock German crank    £97     The devil I know
2/ New stock Brazilian crank   £45     The devil I not sure I want to know?
3/ Regrind exchange crank       £30     The devil some one else knew!
4/ Counter weighted stock       £150+ The devil I would sell my mother to,
but the difference between £30 &amp; £150+ is BIG!

Now I've been advised against Brazilian but the cost is half, regrinds mean
thick bearings as the case has 1mm line bore plus the crank grind, is this a
problem?

The only other thing I have seen is from www.veemotors_dot_com, (or .co_dot_uk) they
fit Water cooled cranks &amp; say they are MUCH better &amp; last longer!?!

Any help is great as I'm not sure what to buy, can you pmail me to
nishikigoi_at_btinternet_dot_com Thanks
