Hello again everybody,
  
   I spent the later part of this muggy afternoon looking over all i could, 
taking all of your suggestions into consideration. still cant get the bus 
started and its four days to set departure day. Looks as if there is gonna be 
a lil' bit of a delay. Don and i ran all the tasts that we could to figure it 
out, and he suspects the ECU. Here's what we did in a nutshell:
  We had good spark at the coil and all cylinders, we had good fuel pressure. 
The plugs were next to pull and they were dry as a bone. We used a spray 
called &quot;Contact ReNu&quot; on all the contact points in the system. He uses this 
stuff every time he has a plug off in the airplanes he works on, and says 
that its great stuff. I took off the little black cover and looked in the 
AFM. All seemed well, so on to checking injectors and other stuff. We didnt 
have a multi tester, so we did what we could with a test light. What we did 
was arc the tester from the positive contact to the negative ground of the 
injector wires. I hypothesised that the light should come on with all twelve 
volts as the engine was cranked, but it only generated a slight pulsatiing 
glow. As the same thing was done to the cold start valve, the glow was much 
more intense for the first half second, but then cut back to a light glow 
also. I dont know what to compare this to, as i have never done any of this 
on a fully operating system. Don suspected that the valve wasnt operating 
properly, so we deposited some gasoline into the air distributer through the 
intake hose. This did absolutely nothing, and i was left in a state of 
dumb-dum. 
  Don suggests that since it seems to be a failure to start and run, and not 
poor running, that it is likely to be the ECU. It may be getting mixed up and 
sending bogus information to the components. I'm not sure if I want to rely 
on this opinion, maybe because lack of support, maybe becuase thats just not 
what i want to hear. Whichever the case, if it isnt fixed by wednesday, its 
goin to the shop.
   I plan on bringing a multi tester over to check out some readings tomorow, 
but dont have the Bently's or Haynes' manual. I dont think that it would be 
possible to to acuire either of these by my deadline. So i'm gonna have to go 
with any clues Muir may drop. I also just had an idea! My friend has a 78 FI 
engine that is (barely) running. If i were to take readings from his, and 
compare to mine, i may be able to find some incompattible sequences. However, 
this is the friend that was inquiring about a new wiring harness. 
Thanks again for the advice, and any that may come.
Any suggestions of stuff that i may have overlooked is greatly appreciated...
