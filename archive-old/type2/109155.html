Subject: Re: [T2] distributor confussion

&gt;   Hey folks.  I own a 69 bus with 71 DP engine.  For a while I was running an 009 distributor but finally
saved my money to purchase a vac advance.  I found one at a well reputed parts house and ordered it.  It was
Bosch part #0 231 167 055. When it arrived today, I noticed that the last three #s were not 055, but 070.  In
searching the archives I found that this is common for replacement on a 72 beetle with the same engine set up.
My question is this, is this the same as the 055?  Also, if so, will the cap and rotor from the 009 fit it?
Thanks for your time!

Well....yes and no, but not real close.
The 055 specs are:

Bus &amp; Pickup 1971 * 1600
Distributor: VW 211-905-205Q, Bosch 0231 167 055 or 211-905-205S, 0231 180 001 &gt; 043-905-205D, 0231 176 033
Can Use: VW 043-905-205D, Bosch 0231 176 033, 113-905-205AH, 0231 167 053
Vacuum Can: 07 092
Timing Set At:: 5deg ATDC _at_ 800-950rpm w/strobe, vacuum hose(s) connected
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 2-5deg Adv, 11-13deg Ret; Centrifugal: 12-16deg _at_ 2200rpm, 22-25deg _at_ 3800rpm

The specs for the 070 are:

Beetle 1972-1973 * 1600 Manual Trans
Distributor: VW 113-905-205AN, Bosch 0231 167 070 &gt; 043-905-205C, 0231 176 028
Can Use: VW 113-905-205AJ, Bosch 0231 167 049
Vacuum Can: 07 102
Timing Set At:: 5deg ATDC _at_ 800-950rpm w/strobe, vacuum hose(s) connected
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 5-8deg Adv, 11-13deg Ret; Centrifugal: 6-12deg _at_ 1500rpm, 22-25deg _at_ 3800rpm

Both have the same total centrifugal amount _at_ 3800. But the bug one reaches 12 _at_ 1500. The bus goes to 12-16 _at_
2200. Having 12 _at_ 1500 is great on a light bug, but not good to have that soon on a heavier bus. 9 times out
of 10, when you buy a rebuilt dizzy the original numbers on the housing are worthless if the guts were changed
to the specs of the one you ordered. But the number you ordered usually is just on the box and you sent the
core back in that box.....
Without a distributor tester, you really don't know what you have. You can get close with a tach, timing
light, and a degree wheel pulley.

The bus vacuum advance only gives you 2-5. The bug is 5-8. I would run the bug vacuum unit on a bus. Vacuum
retard is the same on both.
But all this is only true if you have the correct vacuum unit. The 07 102 vacuum unit will be a dual unit with
the three digit number 889 stamped in the arm. If you have another number, let me know what it is, and I can
probably tell you what it came off of.

Not sure about the cap and rotor.... I throw 009's away.
