Subject: [T2] an annoying problem-need ideas quick!

  Today i decided to change the valve cover gaskets on my '80 vanagon,
and
came across quite a predicament. it seems
impossible to get the clip back over the covers. on an older baywindow
it is easy because the heat exchangers are not in the way. but it is
defintley too hard to do it with your fingers, and there is no room to
pry it up there with a screw driver. anyone else ever faced this
problem?
