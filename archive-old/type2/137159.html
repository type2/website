Subject: Brake booster hose (was Re: ...elimate the power brake servo?)

PS: Does anybody know where to get proper vacuum line for the brake
booster? Heater hose isn't cutting it. FLAPS looked at me funny when I
asked for it...

Hi Don,

In the archives, it has been suggested that 15/32&quot; is the correct size and there was a reference to this web site for 15/32 hose:

http://www.goodyearbeltsandhose_dot_com/cars/vacuum.html

I went to NAPA recently and asked them to cross this number (Goodyear 65108)to their part number and they came up with &quot;H1451 NBH&quot; at $1.99 per foot. I bought some but haven't installed it yet(and probably won't until spring). Quite frankly, it looks like heater hose although hopefully it will resist gas fumes. The hose is marked as &quot;DOT 15/32 VL&quot; made by Gates.

PS. The local NAPA ordered a 50 foot roll of this and I know they have plenty left. If anyone can't find any locally, let me know and I can buy some and ship it.

Good Luck
