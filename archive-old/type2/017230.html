It was said that

&quot;You can install any '72-74 engine.  Same case, same dual carbs.  But
you
will need to figure differences in things like smog pumps, charcoal
filters, etc. (never owned one and not an expert here, but smog pumps
frighten me :-)&quot;

I have done this. Simply remove all smog equipment and use the older
body. No one (outside of CA) ever matches engine numbers to VINs.

Do-able, slightly more differences:

&quot;The '75-78 engine will also fit.  Same case, different exhaust,
different
flywheel, and it came with FI.  ... You can install the '72 exhaust, or
go
with the later exhaust, but must have a complete one of whichever you
choose, as they have no parts in common.&quot;

Im not sure about the exhaust. Isnt there a difference in the flanges at
the head so that you would have to install the correcty exhaust?

Also, in the Muir 25th there is a story about a guy who rips up engine
seals because of tranny differences between earl/late 70s busses?? any
one know more about this. (I mean 72 on, you jokers..)

Its importantto remember (IMHO) that the 70s were transitional for
autos, the engines were be reverse engineered to meet new smog rules
(thus the skitzoid carbs/FI and exhaust year to year changes). I feel
for the 79 VW bussers, last time i was shopping a complete exhaust was
close to a grand (saw car, no exhaust...checked ito it and said no
thanks).
