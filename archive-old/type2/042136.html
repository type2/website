Subject: Re: Joining wires / soldering / crimping ?

There are good and bad crimp connectors of all types. just because its
sleeved or not is no indication. My favorites are plastic sleeved but also
have a metal sleeve inside that crimps along with the actual connector.
The crimper is also a big part of the equation.
Id agree with the idea of soldering if they arent the good connectors/tool
combination.
