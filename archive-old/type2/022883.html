also,

If you reach in behind your dash just to the right of that interior 
light switch, you might find another VW factory pre-drilled hole that 
goes through the dash metal, but not on through the plastic.
This hole must have been there for another switch for something as an 
optional whatever.

Pull switches are readily available at your FLAPS or from donor busses 
that will fit right into this properly diameterred hole, and even 
another VW light switch could be put there to operate an additional 
whatever, such as fog lights, etc.

It will require you putting your pocket knife to the dash plastic at 
that spot, but the drilled hole is already there and is right in 
parallel with the interior light switch that is already there, so it 
does look factory proper and hospital clean.

I mounted a pull switch in this &quot;discovered&quot; hole that applies power to 
my AM/FM radio. This allows the channel memory and clock to stay 
powered, but this additionally installed pull switch allows me to 
remove all radio main circuitry 12 VDC such as the LED illumination, 
the class A power amp, etc. -- Keeps the radio from running down the 
main battery during long storage periods of time, and this additional 
switch gives me control over the radio for playing during camping 
nights without having to run through the ignition circuitry.

I see a lot of toggle switches mounted under bus dashes that do this, 
that, and the other.
Before installing an under dash toggle, you might take a moment with 
your index finger to check and see if there might not already be a 
pre-drilled switch hole in your dash.

As I say however, it will require your putting a knife to the plastic, 
and a hole is forever, even if it does look factory original !
