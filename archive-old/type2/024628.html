No, this isn't an advertisement but a good reference.  I will be leaving the 
Mojave Desert for Germany in a month and that means leaving behind my buddies 
stash of later model type 2 parts.  In exchange I'm offering you all the 
chance to call and see if some of the bigger parts are available.  
Unavailable are things like front ends(beacause of shipping costs) and mint 
shape interior parts.  Plenty of sliding doors, mirrors, lights, rims, glass, 
handles, bumpers, etc. most of them being lifetime desert residents.  My only 
request is that only serious inquiries inquire and no smoke-blowin wannabes 
as I am very busy.  But a gold mine or good deal is definitely available to 
those willing.
Peace Out
Rick
