List,

Can't seem to find this in the archives and don't have my Bentley here at
work...

A listee is talking to me about a 1700 head he's got that i may buy.

I have an 1800 engine.

Would i need to cut them? Are the ODs of the cylinders different?

If OD is the same,  would there be any other concerns?
----------------------

Also, no one really responded to my question about mixing and matching heads.
Basically i want to know what the ramifications would be if i used a 1800FI
head on one side and a 1800 carb head on the other side.

The only real difference in the heads is the valve size:  FI intake:39mm
Carbed =41mm.  Pretty sure exhausts are the same. 

I was one of those kids that always said &quot;but why?&quot; when someone told me to do
something, so even if you're speaking to speculation i'd appreciate your
response. I already know it doesn't sound like a good idea.  Driving from here
to BBTA 98 (415miles) on a whim (83 toyo -150k, bad cv's, etc...)didn't sound
like agood idea either, but i did it anyway and made out fine.

Thanks a pile,

clark in ky.
