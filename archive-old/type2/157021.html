Subject: Re: [T2] Wiper adjustment and horn help

Don't know about the wipers.  Never had problems with mine.   But I had to replace the horn.  Try hitting it with a hammer and  see if it starts working.  If so, it's temporary.  They're  cheap and yours sounds like the typical failure.  Probably no  problem with the wiring but I did clean and adjust the mechanism under  the cap in the center of the steering wheel.  It's not hard to  figure out.  Just remove the main bolt, lift the steering wheel  off, remove three screws in the mechanism, and check that everything is  clean and the wire is hooked up.   Be very careful not to  lose the three springs under the bolts in the mechanism.  Put it  back together in reverse.  But if it were me, I'd start with the  horn.  $12.95 or so and if you don't need it, you will  eventually.  Or better yet, hammer, horn, mechanism, wiring.

Problem  2.) The horn doesn't work at all. It used to work, sort of, but one day  I was honking it (just for fun) and it started to sound like a dying  moose till it just stopped all together. I was wondering if anyone knew  how to tell if I need to replace the horn itself or if it's just the  wiring. 

Thanks for your help!
