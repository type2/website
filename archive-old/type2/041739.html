&gt;What could make my spark advance run on out to 50 degrees?

A dual-vacuum distributor with incorrect static (initial) timing.

&gt;The book says 7.5 degrees BTDC, but I have it set now at 8 degrees ATDC to
&gt;bring
&gt;the advance to 32 at 3000 rpms.

As Karl said, you are using the wrong distributor for your application.
However, all is not lost - you can use the distributor you have if you
disconnect and plug the vacuum retard line and set your initial timing to
about 0TDC.  This will give you the total advance you need, and will work,
as in the engine will run and not self-destruct.  However the advance curve
may not perfectly match what the fuel injection expects, and you will be
running a few less degrees advance at idle.  I expect that those two things
would not make much difference but I thought I'd better mention them.
