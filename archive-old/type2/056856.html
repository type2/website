Subject: From WI to WY and back: Part Five: Yellowstone to Gillette  (trip
  narr)

The last installment of our summer vacation saga left us in Fishing Bridge
RV campsite in Yellowstone. The evening we arrived, after Lisa (my wife)
had completed the laundry, there was a cloudburst followed by a spectacular
double rainbow.

You may recall that we were stuck in the RV park because we arrived in
Yellowstone late in the PM. The next morning, I got up early, jumped on my
bicycle, and rode the five miles to the Bay Bridge campsite. I got there a
little after 6am. On the way, I saw some grazing elk, some trumpeter swans,
and several freshwater pelicans. Once I arrived at the camp, I noticed that
there was a signup sheet for late arrivals, and it listed exactly one
vacant campsite among the hundreds available. What I learned when I further
explored the campsite was that due to rain that had apparently been heavy
recently, many of the campsites were in puddles and quagmires, with picnic
tables and fire rings in puddles. Paying the extra $12 for one night at the
RV park was looking to be a good decision. By about 6:30, some of the park
staff arrived and we signed up for a night of camping. Our campsite was
relatively dry.

I rode my bicycle back to Guac in the RV park. We had decided that since we
had lost most of a day when we had the problems in western Nebraska, we
would need to take the quick tour of Yellowstone. We drove north from
Fishing Bridge to the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. It was raining and
drizzling most of the day. We saw the mud volcano, the Grand Canyon of the
Yellowstone River, Mammoth-Hot Springs, numerous elk, a few moose, bison,
even some grizzlies. We managed to arrive at the Old Faithful area just as
it was erupting.

When we got back to the campsite at the end of the day, we were exhausted.
I adjusted the rear brakes, the kids went to a ranger program at the
campsite.

The next morning was still overcast. I got up early and spent some time
along side Yellowstone Lake. Three pelicans kept me company.

There was construction on the east entrance, but it was much easier driving
out than driving in. West of Cody, the wind in the plains let us cruise at
about 75 mph with little stress on the engine. We crossed the Big Horn
mountains through Tensleep. Guac reached its highest point on the tour,
9669 feet. We arrived in Gillette, WY at about dinner time. We found two
campsites in the area. One was across the road from some sort of exhibition
center. The campsite seemed to be mostly for RVs, concrete plats in the
middle of a field. We went a couple miles west to the Crazy Woman
campground (named, I think, after a river in east-central WY) where we had
a nice site with grass and trees. Lisa went to do the laundry, I went to
work on the starter solenoid. We had had an incident in Tensleep just
before we crossed the Big Horns in which Guac did not want to start. I had
to jump the ignition wire to the main wire to start it up. I hammered on the
solenoid and cleaned up the connections. It was actually a nice place to
work, as it was on grass and had few mosquitos, even at dusk. It was really
quiet.

The next morning we headed toward South Dakota, to Wind Cave National Park.
