&gt; &gt; I have had a set of these on my '71 for several years now and Ron's
right.
&gt; &gt; No rust.  However the plastic beading between the glass and the metal is
&gt; &gt; cracking from the UV exposure.  I;ll have to find a replacement bead
&gt; &gt; material or simply silicone the glass into place.

The plastic you are referring to did finally break apart on mine (after 3.5
years)  I was on the road and needed a quick fix and used weatherstrip
adhesive.  It has eaten the finish off the back and is still holding well.
(3 months)  The Chrome on the other hand is perfect.  (Purchased from
