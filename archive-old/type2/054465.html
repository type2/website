Subject: flywheel question?

Hi all.  first post to the list, but i love this as a goldmine of vw info.
anyway, I'm looking to put an 1800 porsche 914 engine into my 72 bus, but i
don't think the flywheel is the same (approx 1/4 inch deeper?) Can i get a
regular bus flywheel and bolt it right on to this motor?  thanks.
