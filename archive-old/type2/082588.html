&gt; Hello Everyone,
&gt;
&gt; I own and drive daily a 73 bus that I purchased last July.  This is my first
&gt; bus although I've driven bugs for the last 10 years.  On Saturday, I test
&gt; drove a 71 camper as I want to do some camping this summer.  I was extremely
&gt; disappointed with the performance of the 71.  The steering felt loose, the
&gt; brakes had a hard time stopping the vehicle despite a recent adjustment, and
&gt; we generally just felt unsafe.  The 71 has been maintained regularly by a
&gt; good VW mechanic.
&gt;
&gt; According to a longtime bus-driving acquaintence, my 73 drives as a stock
&gt; vehicle of that year should.
&gt;
&gt; So, I'm wondering about the performance differences between a 71 and a 73.
&gt; Are the larger disc brakes in the '73 the first brakes able to stop the
&gt; vehicle safely on their own?  The 71 needed the clutch to assist in the
&gt; slowing the vehicle if I was traveling in excess of 25mph.

You must have had something wrong!  My '71 stops just fine!

The '73 shoes were thicker, not larger in area.  The pistons were also the
same size, so there is no difference in braking force, just pad longevety.
