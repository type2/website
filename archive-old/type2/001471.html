Hi all,

     I just got my latest, a 79 standard.  I love it.  It is my 13th VW &amp; my
6th bus.  My question is,  I am going to change all the fuel lines &amp; was
wondering if all of it is the same size ID line?  Also does anyone have an
approximate number of feet I should buy to do the whole bus?  Thanks.
