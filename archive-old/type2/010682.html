Subject: camper stuff into '71?
Message-Id: &lt;19995518464146334_at_ix_dot_netcom_dot_com&gt;

Listees,
I have a possible opportunity to purchase the camping equipment from a '71 for my '71.

My question is,&quot;Would the following equipment bolt directly into a transporter. Mine is missing everything from the front 
seats back. This doesn't sound like a westy does it? It this what is usually called a Kombi? Camper interior with hard top?


1 complete z-bed

2 small hanging closet sits next to z-bed

3 complete jump-seat that fits behind drivers seats

4 folding table that fits between bed and jump-seat

5 sink/ice-box combo with attached side cabinets and smaller folding table.

6 one complete three louvered crank out window.( off sliding door side)

7 overhead hella reading light

8 small 4-legged step stool

9 matching spare tire cover ( for spare mounted inside back hatch)

10 lots of nuts, bolts, screws, seat belts, brackets for childs cot

11 120 v outlet for r.v. campgrounds


Thanks, Joel '71
