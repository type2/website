&gt; I guess I wasn't clear.  The left headlight if you are sitting in the van.
&gt; Right if you are looking at it from the front.  The antenna is on the
other
&gt; side.

You are correct- totally unclear.
It's like this- FIF (front is front).
Unless it's a rear main seal:)
Left side is left side, no matter where you are looking from.
And don't use &quot;driver's side&quot; around this list.
We have several geographically-challenged lurkers:)
