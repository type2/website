Hi folks i'm new to this game so bear with me and help me out.
My 73 1800cc Westie is a bit poorly, the engine cuts out when the clutch is depressed and the engine revs dying down its slightly better when hot but not much. It has the original carbs (Solex pict 34's). I have a feeling its running a bit rich, fuel (gas to you folks in the U.S. etc) consumption is very poor. 15-19 miles to UK gallon. Are Weber replacement carbs the answer (at a price)? 
Any suggestions welcome
