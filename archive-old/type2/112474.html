&gt;    Yes it is relative; being a

&gt;had to go 15 mph below the posted limit, I'd use the flashers.

Last time the lights went out a huge intersection with 4 lanes each way I put on the emergency flashers as I went though to help gain the right of way. It worked really well.

Regarding Dawn's unfortunate incident: I have an 80 inch long 1 inch wide 3M reflective strip on my bumper. I've seen a noticeable change in the behviour of following drivers; they stay way back from my bumper. The 3M technology can be seen clearly in the dark for hundreds for feet assuming the manic behind you has his lights on.

It's no secret that splits (6V even more so) have cummy rearward lighting compared to the 72-79 bay windows.
