Subject: 69 Westy in IL $100 and parting out 72 Westy

--part1_127.7324fbe.2926a00a_boundary

I am selling a 69 westy that has a clear title body is not horrible , no 
engine or trans. Has some interior parts. Pretty sure it has a good front 
beam on it.  Decent pop-top canvas and top. I would like 100 for it. 

Also have a 72 Westy that has a really bad lower section but has good doors, 
glass, interior and many other parts. Many other parts and buses for sale let 
me know what you need. All parts are located in Rockford,IL. Buses will need 
to be picked up and will only ship select parts.Thanks
