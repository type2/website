Subject: Re: [T2] Progressive vacuum advance problem?

some companies supplying the SVDAs put this information in their product
instructions. Others let you figure it out, LOL.

I am proud that our product instructions are probably 10X longer then anyone
else's selling a &quot;similar&quot; product, and cover any/all details, including the
characteristics of the distributor before, during, and after the break in
period, which includes the vacuum advance break in subject.
