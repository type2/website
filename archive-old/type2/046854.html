Subject: [T2] Funky electric happenings

Hello All,

I'm not much with my van (still learning) and something funky happened today.
Two things seem to fit together actually.  First, my blinker started freaking
out on the dash, blinking erradically. Secondly, at the same time, that red
light on the dash next to the parking brake (marked &quot;B&quot;) would erradically blink
in-synch with the turn signal indicator. That &quot;B&quot; light, when the blinker was
not on, seemed to glow but not stay on. I know that from reading the Muir book
that this &quot;B&quot; light should not be on at all when I'm driving. Is this true? Need
I stop driving untill I fix it? 

Just a little weird thing.

Thanks,
 - Ian
