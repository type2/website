&gt; Folks(and I'm not picking on Don or Jason here either).

Sure you are!!! :-^

The only thing on your list that I haven't done is replace the cables.
Mine are quite old so I'll go grab some today if my shoulder improves
(still hasn't yet, but I haven't taken anything this morning either.)

The thing is that I caused the problem in the first place by shorting
a couple of wires while the engine was running.

Mix that with the fact that I have like $20 to my name until next
Friday, so I can't replace my mulitmeter till then, and I'm flying
blind.

My battery's fine. Both the Wallyworld testing machine said so, and
the fact that it started my Volvo yesterday. It also turned my starter
yesterday!!!!

I pulled ALL fuses out of the fuse block. I disconnected the coil +. I
cranked the starter and it was fine! Then I plugged in the coil +,
tried again and got a high speed relay clicking from under the dash.
Crap. And I re-injured my shoulder doing all this so had to go take a
vicodin and lay down.

My questions have been related to things I can check with just a test
light. I really haven't gotten any answers other than clean the
terminals. So I'll keep posting what little progress I make in hopes
it will trigger someone's memory...
