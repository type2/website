Subject: Part for sale (mostly type I)

I am losing my parts garage :-(  As a result, I am trying to get rid of
the following:

1200cc engine.  Needs rebuilding.  Worked until the carb fire :-(
                comes with replacement intake manifold, carb, and cleaner.

pre-67 bug headlamp assemblies.  These are NOS, tho one sat in a puddle
and is somewhat rusted in front

DP intake manifold and carb

bug engine tin.  '73 bus engine tin. Wiring harness for '71 SB.  Popout
rear quarter windows for late beetle/SB. 

I also have *some* of a '76 Westy interior in my living room, and would
like my living room back :-)  I have:
rear drivers side clothes cabinet (poor condition)
bed/seat (very good condition, very ugly aftermarket fabric)
cooler cabinet (very good condition)
sink cabinet (very poor condition, falling apart)

If you are at all interested, please make me an offer (note that &quot;I'll
pick it up&quot; will do on some of these items :-) (not the bed/seat, tho :-)

I hate to trash this stuff, but.....
