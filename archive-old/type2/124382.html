Subject: RE: [T2] why drive a bus?

As of this Friday, two type2s and one ghia vert will be my full time
transportation. The 99evwk will remain the lady's car in the house.
I figured this was the only way to force myself to have at least 1 dub
always running great. Wish me luck. I don't know what I will do when
winter comes, perhaps a winterized DC is in the future...
I never drive fast, always have a lot of stuff to move around, hate gas
pigs/prices, and like to camp. I also hate the smell of coolant, and
like things simple. That's why I like to drive buses. Plus you can lean
on the sterring wheel and drive for hours on end. I have my new 20 hour
daily record, with 1.5 hours of stop at destination and 6 breaks, 1142
miles to Detriot and back to pick up a cheapo single wheel I found. Damn
trailer wheel pivot bearing needs to be fixed, but that's another story.
