Hey there Robert,

I've kinda sat back on this topic, but I'll add my 2 cents now.

In Europe, some baywindow buses already have the front tire deal
already figured out. It's probably due to some law against front
mounted tires (they musta figured out that front mounted tires are
bad long ago). It involves extending the front bumper (that's the
important part I think) and enclosing the tire. See the link below
for a picture of what I mean.
