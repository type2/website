Michael,

I'm sorry I can't help you... but I'm getting something very similar in my
'71 bus.

The battery that was in it when I got it had been corroded so badly that
it literally took me days to get the cable connectors off of it, using
screwdrivers, baking soda, and liquid wrench.  (Note that the bus would
start with a jump before this point.)

I cleaned off the connectors as best I could and put in a new battery.  At
first, I turned the key just to bring all the dash lights on, and I
checked the radio, headlights, interior lights, etc.  Then, I turned it to
start it.  I heard an electrical click from the engine and then all the
power went off completely.  Turning the ignition off and on did nothing at
all -- no power to *anything*.  The battery is still at full charge.
