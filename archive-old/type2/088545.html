Hey T2 Gurus!

Well I replumbed the distributor.... 180 out. :-(

Good news is though I was finally able to switch wires and time =
correctly.

However the following problems are plauging me:

Sputtering (my wife says backfiring but its not gunshot backfires. Just =
sputters) during decel and cruising speeds. Its also a little bit of a =
bear to start in the morning. Namely I have to give it a pump and white =
smoke billows out during the first few seconds of running.  I do need to =
finish balancing the carbs tommorow but time keeps escaping me. It has =
been drivable and I love it to death. It was definately a step up from =
the Beetle (Which I miss dearly)
