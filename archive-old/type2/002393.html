I had this same problem with the replacement seal on my luggage rack too.  I
found that if I pulled the seal down all the way around so the gap is
smaller, the noise and vibration went away.  I pulled it down so it is just
touching the roof but not so far that it falls off the fiberglass luggage
rack.  This did the trick and it has not come loose in the several months
since I adjusted it.

&gt; This past summer I replaced the luggage rack &quot;not really a seal&quot; seal on
my
&gt; 76 Westy and now it does the same thing at speeds around 70-75 or with a
&gt; headwind.  The old seal appeared to be an actual seal and it had trapped a
&gt; lot of trash around the inside bottom edge of the luggage rack portion of
&gt; the pop top.  The new &quot;not really a seal&quot; seal only covers the edge of the
&gt; fiberglass and it doesn't trap debris but it howls like a lovesick coyote.
&gt; I've tried adjusting the top to eliminate the gap and the bolts are tight,
&gt; but no luck.  Like Todd I would like some suggestions.  Thanks.

&gt; Subject: [T2] roof vibrating
&gt;
&gt; This past summer
&gt; while driving my 74 Westy from Seattle to Oklahoma, when the winds would
hit
&gt; it from just the right side the front part of my Fiberglass roof would
start
&gt; howling vibrating the fiberglass until I would either slow down or the
wind
&gt; would change direction. Now I did take it off this past spring, clean it
all
&gt; out under there and put a new seal around it. Any ideas on how to stop
this
&gt; deaffing vibration? I tried tightening the bolts in the front but am
scared
&gt; to over tighten them. Any ideas will be considered this spring.......Cant
&gt; wait to go camping here in Oklahoma.
