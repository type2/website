Subject: Tail light upgrade

Just finished a little custom work on my right tail light assembly.

I purchased new reproduction units from Bus Depot recently, and I wasn't 
happy with the way the bulbs fit.  The units are pretty good repos, but I had 
trouble with the connectors not fitting on the new housing, and the bulbs 
wouldn't fit into the sockets. 

Since my old housings and bulb holders were shot, and the repo unit wasn't 
working to my satisfaction, I thought I would come up with my own solution.

I went down to the NAPA auto parts main office and looked through their 
catalogs.  I picked out 2 generic lamp holders.  One with one lead for the 
turn, and backup lights, and another with 2 leads for the tail/brake lights.  
I removed the metal plate from my old housing and cut the bulb openings 
slightly larger using my Greenlee punch.

The new bulb holders come with a small mounting plate and I riveted these on 
the back of the metal plate on the lamp housing.

I connected all the wires and put everything back in place, and man do I have 
great working lights!

I still need to complete the left side, and I also plan on adding rear fog 
lights to the blank position.

I'll try to take some pics when I complete the work.  I bought out all the 
parts NAPA had, so they had to order more.

I don't want to be too critical of Ron's tail light assemblies.  They are 
inexpensive, and the only real option out there other than finding a good 
used unit.  I think with a little persuasion, you can make them work.

The original plastic housings deteriorate with age, and I hope the 
reproduction plastic holds up a little better.
