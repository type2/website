There was no bolt for the starter,  the bolt accross on top was put in 
without washers and was flush with the surrounding surface of the bell 
housing. :(  Impossible to remove in the vehicle.  The other two nuts at 
the bottom were a dream to remove. :)

i had the same problem with the motor in the 65 westy.   what a PITA  hm-
maybe that's why that front piece of tim was left off

my solution:

try unsucessfully with a wrench and ratchet to undo it/  from in the engine
compartment and from under the car.

curse

curse at the oil cooler bolted in front of the fan onto the fan housing,
which kept trying to bite me

remove generator and fan housing.  YES it can be done with engine in bus, esp
if there is no stock oil cooler on the motor.  i took this opportunity to
scatter oil from the oil cooler and related hoses to the filter hither and
yon like holy water  (i call on st castrol to bless this bus)   which reminds
me, it's time to put my plastic magnetised jesus on the dash, and i must also
adhere the cookie monster.

finally with improved access, and trying a few techniques, i managed to get
the bolt loose, and remove the motor.

i felt like it shouldn't be that hard.    it's good to hear that i was not
the only one  :)     its a volkswagen.    removing the motor is supposed to
be easy.
