Hi, 

&gt; http:///www.type2_dot_com/dworkin/tires

 But delete the extra leading slash before you go :-)

 This is excellent, a great idea: way to go Steve. I like the interface
well enough, though it might be worth adding links to other resources.

 I also think it might be useful to have subsidiary information on
non-standard applications (oversize tyres, 15&quot; tyres etc), perhaps
on a seperate, linked page.
 Notes on availability in different markets might be useful?

Cheers,
	W.
