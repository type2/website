Subject: Re: [T2] Florescent light and stuff.

----- Original Message ----- 
From: &quot;Wayne&quot; &lt;mga60_at_optonline_dot_net&gt;

&gt; I have a '79 Westy and don't have a florescent light - mine has a three bulb
&gt; incandescent light fixture with a low (one bulb lit), medium (two bulbs lit)
&gt; and high (three bulbs lit) switch.   Is this correct for my bus?  If not,
&gt; does anyone out there have a correct florescent light that they are willing
&gt; to part with?


Wayne,, Most late bays Westfalia's I have seen ~'77 - 79 have the incandescent
style.. although I can only get them to work on low and high,, 1 light on, or 3
lights on...

The earlier Westfalia's do have  a flourescent lamp that looks very similar
