&gt;Both use archaic York compressors on brackets
&gt;mounted to the left rear...

Just cutting in...

While I'm willing to grant that York compressors are not worth two dead
flies at air conditioning, for lack of a contrary, those who go junking and
find one should note that:

They are worth money to 4x4 types. The York compressor employs a peculiar
design that enables it to double as an air compressor (this has to do with
the way it is lubricated). Hardcore Jeep offroad folks desire these highly.
They deflate and inflate tires routinely, and more importantly they go and
buy expensive locking differentials that require an on-board compressor and
tank to work. A welded tubular rear bumper constitutes a tank, but it
requires a York to provide air pressure.

So don't throw them in the trash, trade them!
