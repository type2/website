&gt;Hi all-
&gt;
&gt;Last fall I decided I would take care of all of the little rusty dings on
&gt;my new '73.  So I ground to metal every ding and bubble I could find,
&gt;sprayed with &quot;Extend&quot; rust converter any rust I couldn't get at, and primed
&gt;with Rustoleum.  Now a few months later I am seeing rust pop out in many of
&gt;the spots I &quot;fixed.&quot;
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;But I haven't given up completely on doing some of my own body work!  I'd
&gt;like to take care of the interior myself. &lt;snip&gt;I
&gt;should have used a epoxy based primer that would etch and bond with the
&gt;metal.  But, after searching the archives and the web, the only epoxy based
&gt;primers I can find require a special spray gun.
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone know of an epoxy primer that doesn't? And what goes on top of
&gt;it that doesn't require special equipment to apply? 
&gt;Thanks for your help, now and in the past; this list has been a great
&gt;resource over the last 6 months.

 I recently did a post on painting . . and while I did go get a 
gun of hvlp type for the final paint, it was more of a cost thing.

 You don't need special guns to put these new paints on with . .

 In fact we put all the primers on with a detail gun . . old style

 The spec sheets for all these PPG paints come with recommendations
for the high pressure guns also .. 

 The big hassle with the epoxy, or any of the 2 part paints is that
they have limited pot life . . 2 hours or what. . . .

 Doesn't lend itself to &quot;scrape, brush, primer&quot; like one does with
the spray can or 1 part paint . .

 The trick here is to have a freezer about where you can store 
your mixed 2 part till you can use it . . 

 So far we've kept a 2 part paint in a regular fridge's freezer
for over two months with no kicking off or other deleterious affects.
