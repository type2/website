Subject: Door Interchangability and turn signal screws

Salutations:
I have a '69 Westy that is sadly in need of a driver's door and have not
found a replacement and was wondering if later model doors would fit.
Secondly,  the four little screws that hold the turn signals to the
steering column (both sets, the ones that hold the switch to the housing
and the ones that hold the two piece housing together)  are  stripped
out ( not the threads but the cross hatch for the screwdriver).  I've
been to the local hardware store and FLAPS and so far the screw heads
are all too big to fit inside the housing.   Any body have any leads?
