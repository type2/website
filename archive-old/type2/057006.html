   I'm one of the 20-something bicycle guys who has a lot of
money in their bike.  But I drive a Westy.  The problem with
most of those gen-x'ers, which I'm one of, is that they're
used to haveing things done for them.  Those guys in the
bike shop probably don't even work on their own bikes,
they're too lazy.  How do you expect them to work on a VW.
If you frequent the mountain bike lists you see that a lot
of people in my age group would rather pay the BSG (bike
shop guy) to fix their bike than learn to do it themselves.
To me part of the fun of riding bikes AND owning a VW is
working on them myself.  I'm still learning to work on the
VW.
