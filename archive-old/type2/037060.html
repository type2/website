Subject: Re: Wristpin bushings?

&gt; List,
&gt; I skimped on my rebuild and did not use rebuilt conn rods. Everthing else
is
&gt; new/rebuilt.
&gt;
&gt; The heads are torqued and i'm ready to start accessorizing.
&gt;
&gt; Has anyone ever experienced or witnessed 'small-end' rod failure in a
type4?

Mine was a Type 1, 1600 DP.  I did that and it cost me an additional engine
pull when the ticking started.  At least get new bushings pressed in to be
sure. Just MHO.
