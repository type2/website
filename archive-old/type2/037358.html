Subject: windshield fun

Hello all,

Last evening I was reinstalling my windshield after buying
a new seal and ended up cracking my windshield.  Needless to
say it was going in great and I only had a few feet left on
pulling in the seal doing that rope trick. I figure it cracked
because my friend put to much pressure on the outside.
Any chance it could have been because the glass was so old?

I was looking for some advice on where to buy a new windshield
from and who to install it. The price in Rocky MM seemed
reasonable $149 for a 77' bus but they wanted $30 for packing
charges plus shipping via truck charges. I checked my local shop
and they don't sell glass. Any ideas or experiences would help me.

Alex, in TN
very discouraged,temporarily hopefully:(
