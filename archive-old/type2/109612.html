Subject: Re: [T2] waterproof distributor???

Not water proof, but here in Aust. there are rubber boots available that cover
the distributor cap and leads. They're made for buggies that have the motor
open to the elements. Surely buggy places there would have similar devices.
Also Motor cycle spark plug caps are rubber and will keep water out of there
also.
Every bit helps I suppose.
