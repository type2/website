Thanks George and Richard,

You have to set up an account and have a salesman come to you. I did
this about two years ago. Be advised that the salesman are assigned regions
and if you aren't going to provide a lot of business they might not bother.
In that case you might have better luck making friends with a vw foreign
shop that does a lot of business with Wurth and see if they will add to
their monthly order for you.

Thanks, sounds like I should head to the local VW shop. I have seen 
Wurth products there.  Not a bad bunch of guys even if they rely on the 
water-cooled tuner crowd to make money, and I invested heavily with them 
when I did my rebuild awhile back.
