Subject: Re: [T2] crankshaft--removing dist. drive gear

Volks,

Just a quick note to anyone considering a new replacement for their 
Type 1 motor...it would appear that VW Mexico does NOT include the 
dizzy drive gear installed in their new long blocks, and unless you 
REALLY know what you're doing and/or have the right tools, they are a 
PIA to install.

I was lucky and had a pro helping me out, otherwise I would not be on 
the road today.

Just a head's up.

&gt; you use a
&gt; puller.
