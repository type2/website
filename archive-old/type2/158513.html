  Won't  happen again for
&gt; another thousand years.  I just hope to have my  bus finished by then. 
&gt; Cheers...KR


&gt; Depending on your date format, it will happen again on May 4, 2006. For
&gt; many locales outside of the US, a common date format is DD-MM-YY.

And it occurs every 100 years, 2106, 2206, etc.

I wonder how many of our buses will be around then?
