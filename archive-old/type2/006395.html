&gt; I remain unconvinced that air coming out of the engine driven by the fan
&gt; has sufficient volume and pressure to substantially increase air
&gt; pressure directly under the engine of a vehicle travelling at freeway
&gt; speed.  You can feel the airstream coming out under the cylinders when
&gt; revving engine high at rest and it's pretty small compared to the rush of
&gt; air you feel when sticking your hand out the window at freeway speed.
&gt; Avoiding any instance where you are sucking hot air into your cooling
&gt; airstream seems like an obviously good idea.
&gt;

I'm not trying to be argumentative. However, the solution to your &quot;problem&quot;
is staring you right in the face. Remove the rear tin, and drive it. If the
airstream under the bus is at a lower pressure than in the engine
compartment, the engine temps will not increase. If the pressure is higher,
the hot air will flow towards the lower pressure (engine compartment), and
the temps go up.

So the question is answered when you remove your tin and drive it on the
highway. You will be convinced after the test, I'm sure of it.
