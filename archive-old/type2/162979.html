Subject: Re: [T2] Blowing Blue

Sourtney interrogated:
&gt;It's good?  How would it be good?

	Upper cylinder lubrication at cold startup.


&gt;  Sid is right on the money with his diagnosis.

	Far be it from me to dispute the diagnosis of a Canuck who 
knows about Meteors.


&gt;  If VW had wanted something to push blue, they'd have left the valve 
&gt;stem seals out of the engine.  Racing clearances?  I build racing 
&gt;clearance type 1 engines, and they don't puff blue on startup.

	And how long do you ask the cylinders/rings/pistons to last 
before rebuild of these racing motors?


&gt;  If anything, it's the valve stem seals worn, or the valve guides, 
&gt;allowing oil to slip by.

	I've been assuming that's what it is.


&gt;Not a big deal if you aren't going through a quart of oil every 300 
&gt;miles, but a nuisance at times. Usually typical of an older motor, 
&gt;especially if it's parked on an angle.

	Nobody is saying a quart per 300 mi is OK.  The question 
related only to a puff of blue at cold start.  I still say that if 
that's all Nat has wrong, he shouldn't worry.
