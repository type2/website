Subject: Re: [T2] Starter Question (fwd)

A door bell button is what's starting my bus as we speak! heh

The ignition switch looks like Wolverine tried to start it with his claws. 
Switch, barrel, etc are all chewed. So the DPO wired in a toggle switch (for 
the ignition itself) and a doorbell switch to turn the starter.

What really scared me was that the guys at the VW shop had no problem 
figuring it out!
