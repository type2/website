In 1997, VW of America sent a representative from Dallas to replace the =
heater boxes, etc. in my '79 bus, all at no charge. He replace right and =
left heater boxes, flapper boxes, accordian tubes, etc., and snapped a =
few photos of my bus.

A number of listrmembers took advantage of this offer. VW, however, =
never mentioned the A-word as the reason behind all of this. I guess =
they were just worried that our feet might get cold next winter.  ;&gt;I =20

&gt;Note that the people who developed problems with asbestos were the
&gt;workers at the asbestos manufacturers who breathed the fibers for years =

&gt;and accumulated massive quantities. Studies showed if you packed a rats =

&gt;lungs with fibers, they would die. It is reasonable to be cautious =
about=20
&gt;over exposure, but the reality is a few particles here and there will =
not=20
&gt;overwhelm the body's protective mechanisms.
&gt;
&gt;What is the end result of regulation overkill. Rather than $2000 to
&gt;remove and dispose of asbestos tiles on a house, it will cost you =
$25,000=20
&gt;to meet the regs, all to reduce risk from 99.8% to 99.9% safety for the =

&gt;homeowner and neighbors. This is your liberal based politically correct =

&gt;tax dollars at work, folks.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
