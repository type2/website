X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Hey all,
  I am looking at a 71 Westy that is for sale near me. The guy only want
$300 for it and it is real straight and complete. It has the rear bug screen
and upper cot, but is missing the childs cot, and the fauset. It needs
engine work, the engine locked up so I am assuming the worst.
  The one thing I am going to need for it though is the trim around the
cabinet doors. It is the white trim that goes on the edge of the doors and
fits against the cabinet. I read in the library of &quot;T&quot; moldings. Is this the
stuff? It seems to me it would be more &quot;+&quot; shaped. I have the Outwater
catalog, but do not know what the part number would be. 
  I will be picking it up as soon as I sell my completely rust free 63
Bug(shameless plug) which I hope to be soon. This would be the 6th Bus I
have had, I am currently without a Bus and really want to get a Westy so I
can do a little camping with the kids.
