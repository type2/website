&gt; Anyway, I attached it to the 3 mysterious bolt holes in the rear body section of 
&gt; my 72.  I tried every different size metric bolt I could find, but in the end a
&gt; 3/8 bolt fit the best.  I still haven't figured out what the bolt holes are really for. 

Are you referring to the mounting holes in the frame rails in proximity to the bumper mounts? If so, these are the mounting holes for the stock German hitches.
They are various manufacturers (Westfalia, Peko, and others) making two different hitches: one rated at 1200 kg towing capacity and 50 kg vertical force on the hitch and on rated at 1500 kg towing capacity and 75 kg vertical force on the hitch. Both styles consists of a strong tube that runs behind the bumper (the bumper mounts to the hitch) and a sort of U-shaped tube in the middle that attaches to the cross tube on one side and has a ball at the other. The hitch mounts are pretty much like the bumper mounts, only that they are stronger extends 10 cm more inches up front to include the third mounting hole (in line with the 2 bumper mounting holes). On the higher capacity hitches, the mount also attaches to the outer side of the frame rails using the mounting holes there. 
My 79 camper has a home made hitch that seems to be fairly sturdy: 50 mm tube welded onto bumper mounts, approx. 5mm steel plate welded to tube in center of the car, ball is screwed into this steel plate. For cosmetic reason (I think) a second tube runs parallel about 10cm higher creating something like a really heavy bumper.

Cheers,
Marcus
