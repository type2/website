&gt;&gt;There is no rotor turning procedure

&gt;&gt;manuals and find the pages that describe the procedure for the
&gt;&gt;tuning of rotors. Take all day if you like.
&gt;
&gt;These are good articles, keep it coming, and thank you. =^ )
&gt;
&gt;However, the Bentley procedure for turning brake rotors is delineated in
&gt;Section 8.7.7 of the bay-window manual. It gives specs for minimum
&gt;thickness and maximum runout.

Thanks Ken. Glad to see someone has the tenacity to actually do some
reasonable research to determine the facts. I typically put such tests
in my diatribes to see if anyone is paying attention. If you had the
time to research all the various European factory manuals, you would
find the procedure in the large majority verboten, and stated as such.

Wipe that snot off from around your nose so it doesn't drip on your
manuals and smear the greasy fingerprints.
