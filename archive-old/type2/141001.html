Subject: Re: [T2] Type 2 is about Type 2's, right?

Michael,

Could you send me a copy of the &quot;dirty&quot; post. I seem to have read all the 
comments but not the actual post. I'm seventy and my life is not very 
exciting. Seems all I do is work on the bus and hardly ever drive it. I'm 
hoping your &quot;dirty&quot; post might bring a little spice into my life in my final 
years.

Phil
70 Type 2 since new

    Anyway , I also try to make some joke in this list, some people did not
    share my sens of humors , they wrote me a personal email without 
bringing
    up the all thing to the list, I think that was the way to go !!!

    My apollogies to all for the stink and color. I will try to be more 
Vanilla
    with the postings from here out.

From: Michael Knight
    Thanks Chris. I am not saying you agree with me or cared for my posting. 
But
    I think it is very Hypocritical for some folks to say &quot;this is not Bus
     content&quot;. &quot;I come here for Bus stuff not politics or religious 
material,
     etc.&quot;  All the while they never mention Bus content. Go figure....

    Rules to me were meant to be tested or place an average discilpine 
otherwise
     we would all be computers living in a binary world. Exactly rwright or
     exactly wrong.

    Bus content: The highways where I live have set speed limits but 
ocasionally
     I have gone over them in a Bus. But this is a rare occasion due to the 
fear
     that the wrath of law and order will be implimented and my rights might 
be
     possibly taken away. Either the Bus would break or the driving 
privilages
     revoked.
