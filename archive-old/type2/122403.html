&gt; First off, you need a thread gauge. They come in metric and inch and they
&gt; are not expensive, a good tool to have.

Agreed. I've been wanting a set of a while and this is the first time I've
been hobbled without it.

&gt; You also need a caliper or
&gt; micrometer to measure the diameter of the thread, then you can identify any
&gt; thread.

I have that but it's hard to measure sometimes were there are only a few
threads and it's hard to tell tapered from straight.

&gt; I think what is making this confusing is not
&gt; only the distinction between metric and inch threads, but also straight and
&gt; tapered.

That's what I was hoping someone would answer when I suggested I've
overlooked something obvious.

&gt; There are no tapered threads used on the VW case anywhere. This is
&gt; surely because the case materials crack easily - VW used straight threads
&gt; and sealing rings to prevent this from occurring.
&gt; 
&gt; - the oil pressure switches are m10x1.0 straight.

Yes, the VDO ones look it.

&gt; I don't know
&gt; the torque on the sender, but with the vdo tapered one I would use about 10
&gt; ft-lbs. 

None is listed.

FYI, identical switches on 911 cases (from Hella and identical except for
bar value) torque to 14.7 ft. lbs. no matter the case alloy. I think you've
probably found an appropriate value to start with and check to see if there
are any leaks before applying more torque.

I did count how many times the original switch rotated when I removed it. 4
1/2 turns with the last 1/2-3/4 turns where the torque had to be applied. It
sure would be horrible to wreck the case for such a simple item.

&gt; Bear in mind that an oil pressure switch I san item found on every vehicle,
&gt; and a great many of them look identical to each other. On an old motor one
&gt; might find almost any oil pressure switch there, it could be the original
&gt; one or a replacement part. There are literally hundreds of these parts made
&gt; that all look the same at a glance. If it is a tapered one, it is not
&gt; original, I say this because I have dismantled quite a few motors known to
&gt; be untouched since the factory and they all had straight threads on the oil
&gt; switches.

No doubt true. In my case the sender is stamped 1/78 (bus built 2/78) and
there is also a VW part number and logo on the bottom of it.

&gt; The new VDO oil pressure hose seems to be a 1/8-27 hose with two adapters to
&gt; make it m10x1.0 tapered on both ends (one male, one female). The old VDO
&gt; hose had metric threads and no adapters.

This is where I'm still confused. Here's another photo of what I bought:

The female end and the male end of the adapter are definitely of the AN
variety. The other two match as you saw in my other photo of the cable
eating itself. Since the male end does not fit the case or my tee with the
female M10x1 straight thread tee I'll have to get it measured to satisfy my
curiosity and locate a suitable substitute or adapt it. This VDO 150 752D
seems to be a dud with 1/8-27 NPT threads.

Thank you Scott. I'm on the road to recovery.
