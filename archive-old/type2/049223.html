Hi Lukas

&gt;The van No is: 2292080102
&gt;and the engine No is: CJ019599X
&gt;It was first registerd in Germnay in January 1979 as a 2L model.
&gt;Am I looking at a 1978 or true 1979 and what is the difference?

This is a '79 model.  From the number I would guess it was made around end
'78 or Jan '79.  You can get the actual week number from your m-code plate
under the dash if you feel inclined.  The difference is in the shape of the
exhaust ports - '79s are squarer and the flange is in a different position.
However...
The engine number indicates a much earlier 2L (I presume the numbers were
issued in order of manufacture; mine is a '78 and the (original) engine
number is CJ078896).  It could be a '76 engine, say.  I take it the X has
been stamped on later to indicate a rebuild.

&gt;THe next question will be which heat exchangers I will need. but that
&gt;is a totally different story. Trying to get hold of  original quality
&gt;ones in Germany or the UK..

The only way you will know for sure which ones you need is to take the old
ones off.  The engine may have been rebuilt with '79 heads anyway.
Original '79 exchangers will be hard to find (for that matter, so are the
earlier kind).
