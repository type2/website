Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel line replacement

&gt;When I had my injector off, I only saw one seal. Your site lists part #
&gt;311 133 261 for lower end of injector. What is 311 133 263 (upper end of
&gt;fuel injector?  I only saw one seal on my injectors!
&gt;  
&gt;

There is a small donut seal that goes around the injector tip and 
presses against the manifold.  That actually seals from outside air 
getting in with the fuel.  The seal, which isn't much if a seal, is a 
larger donut shaped rubber o-ring that goes around the injector and 
helps to keep it in place when you screw the injector holder in place.

Mike
