Subject: cut off hose

73 Westy 1700 progressive
I just noticed this...
On the driver side, there is a hose coming out the top of the tin behind the intake runner (in front of firewall).  It has been cut off and just sticking out/up.
Any ideas on what this is/was? 
If it helps any, the pass. side head has the two threaded metal tubes sticking out next to the intake runners..was for smog pump I guess.
thanks all!  -Chris
