Subject: Re: [T2] scary situation

If it was me I would hope this was my problem, tighten a few bolts down?  Thats quick and cheap next to an engine rebuild, when I saw this I thought it was really interesting, I have never given much thought to the possibility of an oil leak causing a loss in oil pressure.

&gt; I hope that's not my problem. I'm not leaking much oil. Thanks...KR
