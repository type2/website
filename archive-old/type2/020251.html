Subject: Sliding door maintenance
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

After reading the Type2 Library's chapter on sliding door maint,
I made a brief inspection of my May-1973 Westfalia sliding door's
Rear Support (RS).
The plastic sliding block had come adrift from the pot metal
casting.  I also found that sometimes the wheel would spin and
other times it would not.  The wheel would often skid along the
track, trying it's best to imitate the absent sliding block.

I drove to a local junkyard looking for a donor bus to salvage
parts from.  I found a 1969 model that had a beautiful RS, so I
took the RS home.  All of the other buses in the junkyard had
terribly worn out RS units.

I discovered some subtle differences in the plastic sliding block
assembly.  The 1969 used a phillips head bolt, washer and nut to
hold the sliding block in place.  The end of the bolt was hit
with a steel punch to deform it slightly, so that the nut is not
easily (or ever) removed.  On my 1973, there was a sort of long
pop-rivet holding the sliding block in place.  This pop-rivet
and the sliding block had broken.

I phoned my local VW dealership and they have a new sliding block
in stock for $9.45.  The nut/bolt assy to hold it in place is NLA.
The wheel is also NLA.  The junkyard 1969 RS assy was about $5.

The 1969 RS was in working order, so I cleaned it up and lubed it.
It fit perfectly in my 1973 and works great.

TGIF,
