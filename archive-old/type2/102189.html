Subject: Re: [T2] Head failure_at_ 15K Miles -todays fuel questions

George,

Your last statement is not necessarily the case.  There are several people 
on the megasquirt list that are using and/or contemplating water injection
while in turbo boost.  One guy has a scirroco that he has it on and is 
using megasquirt along with the water injection to get 199hp out of
his watercooled engine.  It is his daily driver.

Please don't ask me why!  Some of the stuff those guys talk about on that 
list are *far* beyond me in terms of engine mods.  I'm just in it for the 
injection stuff.

Cheers, dave

&gt; The purpose of water injection is to absorb the energy spikes that cause
&gt; detonation.  This allows the use of much greater compression ratios or
&gt; boost in racing engines.  Unfortunately, the energy lost by flashing the
&gt; water to vapor is not recovered as power.  For racing, you don't care
&gt; about the extra fuel used, but this is not acceptable for street use.
