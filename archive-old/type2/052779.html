Before messing with the fuel filter, fill the tank with gas and check
  the flowrate at the fuel pump. Just disconnect the fuel line at the
  pump inlet and have a small container to catch the gas. If you get a
  good flow then the filter is ok. Good flow is anything greater than
  a quart in five minutes. Saves you the trouble of disturbing the
  connection to the tank if there is no problem.

&gt;Michael,
&gt;   I had this same problem last April, while on the way to Everybus 
&gt;2000.  
&gt;You are thinking along the right track in thinking fuel problems.  
&gt;Screwed 
&gt;into the bottom of your fuel tank, right at the outlet, there is a 
&gt;filter 
&gt;screen.  Well, after 30 years of never being cleaned, it gets 
&gt;clogged up to 
&gt;the point where not enough gasoline is getting to the engine.
&gt;   The best thing to do would be remove the gas tank, flush it, seal 
&gt;it, and 
&gt;reinstall it with a new screen in it.  I didn't have that option, so 
&gt;what I 
&gt;did was to remove the old screen, run about 5 gallons of alcohol 
&gt;through the 
&gt;tank to flush it while still installed, install a new screen and 
&gt;seals, 
&gt;replace all fuel lines along with a new in-line filter.  Then check 
&gt;the 
&gt;in-line filter daily as it will be picking up the loosened dirt from 
&gt;the 
&gt;tank as it comes out.  I had to change that filter every week for 
&gt;about a 
&gt;month.
&gt;   To find this filter screen, just follow your fuel line back to 
&gt;the tank.  
&gt;The screen will be the hex right there where the fuel line hose is 
&gt;attached. 
&gt;  It screws out in the normal fashion.
