Subject: Electronic Ignition

Hi all you Vdubbers -

I have a 1976 fuel injected 2000 cc Westfalia camper van.  It died on the way
home from Yuma.  Just stopped running and wouldn't start again.  I checked the
point gap, it was fine.  A non-VW mechanic thought that it was the fuel pump,
but wouldn't work on it because it was a VW, so I had it towed to a VW mechanic.
He said that it was simply a matter of the points being fouled.  He said he shot
a bit of carb cleaner in and it started right up.

I've had a problem with the points closing up and getting fouled very quickly.
The mechanic recommends that I have him install a Compufire electronic ignition.
He says it makes the distributor electronic, it has an overhead fire rather than
an air gap.  He said that with this electronic ignition, the timing never
changes, that I'll never have to retime it again, and the points won't go bad.

He seems like a good mechanic who knows VWs quite well.  He says the Compufire
electronic ignition costs $69.95, with about $40 for labor to install.  It
sounds like a good deal to me, almost too good to be true, which made me think
that I should consult the experience of the Type2 list.

Thanks in advance for your input.

Jeannie
