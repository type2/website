Subject: an urgent Cry for help!

Hello all. I'm in urgent need for someone to help me tow my bus back to 
Virginia. Right now I am in Houston Texas and i can't get my bus back to Virginia. 
The bus won't make such a long trip  by herself. I can't afford the cost of a 
transportation service to have my bus shipped back to Virginia and I don't 
have a truck or trailer so I am in quite a hard place. Im moving back to Virginia 
on the 27th of this month and I'm franticlly trying to find a way to get her 
back home. Can anybody help me out? I can provide cash for gas and some money 
for your efforts. I can't afford much because I'm a very broke college student 
but i can probably afford between $300-$400. Thank you very much for any 
help! Fare thee well-Evan
