Subject: SVDA on the type 4

But did we ever determine whether or not the SVDA
has sufficient advance for the type4?  John, I
thought you said it had insufficient total
advance?

No doubt in my mind that a type1 SVDA would be
superior than a 009 on a type4 bus engine, as
there would not be the famous 009 hesitation at
less than 3000rpm.
