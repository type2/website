&gt; What do you mean by hatch? You mean the engine compartment hatch? I  
&gt; thought all Type-2s had the engine compartment hatch?

No, only '73-'79 had the top hatch over the engine (in the luggage  
compartment).  The '72, in true transition year style, had the Type 4  
engine with dual carbs, but no hatch for access to the top of the  
engine.  Truly, a PITA, truly.

Bay windows through '71 weren't so bad in lacking the top hatch,  
because the Type 1 engine doesn't require so much access through the  
top (looking at a Type 1-powered Bus, I am always amazed at how much  
room there is in the engine compartment compared to my '76! :-)
