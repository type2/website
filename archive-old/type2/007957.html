Subject: funky gunk in oil filler
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

HI VOLKS!  Ok,here's my problem.My camper('70 w/a '71 type1 engine) is having a problem w/ the crankcase ventilation system.The oil filler tube and tube going to the air filter contain some funky gunk,tan in color(possibly f/moisture and oil mixing while engine breathes).We removed tube f/air cleaner and extended it from the oil filler to below engine,outside towards the ground.Will this help?Any other suggestions?Thanks in advance!
