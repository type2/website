&gt; Hello List,
&gt;    First I would like to give a little information about myself as I am new
&gt; to this list.  After driving an 1982 1.6l Diesel Vanagon Westy for some
&gt; years and realizing the limitations of the power of the engine and the hills
&gt; I live in(Pennsylvania) i decided to let my Van (&quot;Old Orange&quot; or &quot;Easty the
&gt; Westy&quot; depending on my mood) rest after the engine blew for the second time
&gt; until I can replace with Ken Wilfy's 1.9l Brazilian diesel engine.  THis led
&gt; me to purchasing a 1973 type 2 which i saw sitting in a farm field.  The bus
&gt; is pretty solid other than the minor things that most of you can imagine add
&gt; up after 7 years in a field.  It has been my daily driver for about the last
&gt; 4 months and currently I have had a problem with the fuel pump which I could
&gt; really use some help solving.
&gt;      I have been having some problems getting the dual Solex's tweaked
&gt; properly and three days ago I noticed a gas leak under the bus.  Upon
&gt; further inspection i realized that the fuel is coming from the hose which
&gt; extends off the bottom of the fuel pump and is not connected to anything.
&gt; Perhaps it is some kind of breather or overflow.  I do not know much about
&gt; these things but i am willing with the help of another local listee (thanks
&gt; Josh) to try to keep this bus alive forever.  I am curious to what might
&gt; cause fuel to come out of this hose.  The hose can best be described as a
&gt; woven fabric hose that can be viewed in the Haynes manual for 1972 through
&gt; 1979 transporters on page 46 on the illustration. It is the hose seen
&gt; between the line indicating numbers 16 and 11 but is not numbered.  My bus
&gt; is a 1973 with stock dual SOlex carbs.If anyone can help me diagnose this
&gt; problem please either post on the list or since i am new and not so good at
&gt; finding my way around the list respond at my e-mail which is
&gt; s_rippey_at_excite_dot_com.  I think it could either mean i need to repair the fuel
&gt; pump or that the carbs may have something to do with this leak, perhaps
&gt; running to rich or lean.   Please help as I am stranded with no vehicle
&gt; until this problem is remedied.  Also I should mention that the leak is very
&gt; slow, maybe 1 drop every 20 minutes.  Thanks in advance for any help or
&gt; suggestions.

Seth:
You are correct, you need a new fuel pump. You might be able to get justa
diphragm kit, which would be about half price. The hose is hooked to a vent on
the inside of the fuel pump so that when it fails, the gas runs out rather than
into the crankcase, contaminating the oil. It seems like that fuel pump takes a
bit of finagling to get it out either 6mm allen or 12 point bolts. The whole
carb setup is quite difficult to set up to get running correctly, but when it is
right it is really quite powerful and thrifty. Very little different than the FI
which superceded it. These dual carbs were used on all 2 liter air cooleds clear
up into the Vanagon era in Europe and Australia. The FI Might be a little more
trouble free, might have a little more power, but not much. FI is definitely
cleaner, smog-wise.
Regarding the 82:
What kind of highway fuel mileage did you get with the 1.6 diesel? How much for
the 1.9 deisel engines? I'm driving an 82 diesel van for a work vehicle for the
last 10 years and have had my share of engine problems. My latest engine is one
my brother rebuilt and it's working pretty good right now. Long term plans are
to put in a turbo-diesel engine, 68 horsepower, from a Quantum. I want to get
most of the factory parts to make a nice installation, like the air cleaner and
muffler and exhaust pipe.
Any increase in power will also require a change in gear ratios, so I've got
some plans for that, too. I've got tools to wokr on the 091's.
Keep in touch.
Al Brase
