Jaime,

I've got to tell you I don't know jack about these things. I was under the 
impression that these things took 12VDC and converted it to AC like a house 
current. The other way around. Thats why you could plug appliances in the 
little breaker under the seat in the back or is that just when your hooked to 
shore power. I knwothere were several settings on the control panel in the back.
But it's been a while since I have looked at one of those control panels.
