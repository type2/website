Subject: re: starter woes

I had a stupid beetle that would occasionally do this to me, when you get under 
the bus look for a push on female connector that might have come loose.  It 
would be the thinner of the two or three wires on the starter.
If you're lucky and this is your only problem, crimp the connector a little 
tight with some small needle nose pliers and force it back on the blade.
good luck,
