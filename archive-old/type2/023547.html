Subject: front wheel bearing torque?
Message-ID: &lt;5a6ebea2.2526dff9_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Can someone please help me i am doing a brake job on my 71' bus and i am 
replacing my calipers, rotors, pads and bearings. Everything that should be 
replaced on a bus that has been sitting for along time. But my question is 
how do i torque the spindle clamp nut? Any help that anyone can give me would 
be great.  Thanks
