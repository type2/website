Hi Folks:

Before everyone jumps to conclusions, we had a NASTY storm here 
yesterday and early today and the folks in Redding got it as SNOW! 
Also a lot of power is out and phone service.  Redding is 3 -4 hours 
north from me but I looked at the weather maps.  We still have power 
out in places here and broken trees everywhere.

Let's hope the &quot;boys&quot; are down in Brazil scoring more parts for us!

BEN
