Message-ID: &lt;3731e0a0backorder depot (was 'this won't be popular')*_at_m400gw.wiley_dot_com&gt;

&gt;I have read many, many times that folks on the list use and recommend Bus 
Depot. My experience with them, though limited,
&gt;has not been great.

Put a mechanism in place to inform the buyer at the time of order taking 
whether a part is in stock. Rocky Mountain does it,
why can't they?

Yesterday I got one part from the order and a full invoice. 2 items are 
listed as backordered. Items essential to the job I planned.

Add to the fact that I guess unlike most of the people they deal with, my bus 
is my transportation, and right now it's down, been
down for a week. what this 'backorder' incident tells me (it's happened twice 
in a row) is that I'm held hostage til they get their
order in from East Japeepee, and forward it to me. No ETA, by the way. This 
sucks if you counted on them having it and 
sending it. Since the wait is just as long, I'm better off doing business 
with Rocky because they can tell me if they don't have 
something.

However, I called and complained and Dan looked into it, called me back and 
said the part would be in today, and he'd express the part out to me by the 
weekend, so I have to give them kudos for customer service. Now they should 
just concentrate on selling parts they know 
they have, not parts that might come in someday.....
