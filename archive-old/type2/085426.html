Faster-Laster sends:

&gt; Here's one of the strange things about us trademark law. A lot of
&gt; times (from what i understand) to backup claims of trademark
&gt; infringement you must show that you have tried to protect that
&gt; trademark previously. That means that if VWoA didn't go after anyone &amp;
&gt; one day decided to, it would be quite hard for them to stop the other
&gt; party from using things like bug or bus. I don't know how much of the
&gt; claims VW makes would actually hold up in court, but most people don't
&gt; have the deep pockets like VWoA.

It's not strange at all. The theory is, if you don't defend your mark you
must not care about it.

Here's what's weird to me: &quot;Bug&quot; seems like a pretty solid trademark for a
car (as is &quot;Beetle&quot;) because only Volkswagen makes &quot;Bug&quot; shaped cars. But
&quot;Bus&quot;? Let's see...school bus, short bus, muni bus, hippie bus, tour bus,
Greyhound bus, IEEE 1394 bus, universal serial bus...not to mention busboys
and busman's holidays! How can you trademark Bus?
