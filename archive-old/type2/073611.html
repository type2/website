Subject: Maintence on an old bus

Greetings,
I just got a 1978 Bus (engine 2000). It sat in a field for 5 years =
before I
got it, but started right up.
 The engine is remarkably clean, no oil underneath or anything. I drove =
it
home (50 miles I know I shouldn't
have done that without maintence but it was the only way I could get it
home). It drove great, only problem was when I got it
home and shut off the engine it wouldn't start again right away (it =
barely
turned over). I waited a while and it started up fine,
don't know what would cause that. My question is, after 5 years in a =
field
what kind of maintence (besides cleaning all the
bugs out of it) should I do on it before I start driving it everyday?

Thanks in advance,

Dan
