Subject: Re: [T2] Head temperature sensor

Ring connector that you put a bolt or the spark plug through.  Preferred 
from this group and the type 4 gang is the number 3 cylinder.  Still 
waiting on my new one.  the dreaded backorder.

&gt; What do these things look like? Specifically, what does the business
&gt; end look like? I'm putting new heads on my bus this weekend and want
&gt; to put a head temperature gauge in it while I'm at it. I know the
&gt; preferred mounting location is #3 hole, but I don't know how it gets
&gt; mounted there.
&gt; I'm going to have some ports on the heads that will need
&gt; to be plugged, and am thinking that mounting the sensor in one of those
&gt; makes more sense than right on the spark plug hole, as it would be
&gt; more permanant.
&gt; Not knowing how the sensor mounts, however, this is pure speculation on 
&gt; my
&gt; part.
&gt; Thanks.
