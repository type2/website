Dano:

I too have a '73 white over blue bus, with the Weber Carb set -up.
Hopefully you are not &quot;blessed&quot; with the auto tranny as I am.

Since the weber is not stock, I cobbed together a solution to the
cannister/oil breather/weber combo,  I think after seeing some suggestions
on this list.  (You may want to check the archives.)  On the left side of
the fan housing, there should be a connection for a hose approx. the same
size as the left hand side connection on the charcoal cannister.  Connect
these with an appropriate size hose.  Since this is pushing air out of the
fan housing and through the cannister, I connected the other end of the
cannister to a hose that runs to a &quot;T&quot; fitting.  On the other side of the
&quot;T&quot; fitting is a hose from the oil breather;  again, this should have
positive pressure.  (Yours apparently does as it's spitting oil.)  I then
connected the base of the &quot;T&quot; to a hose that runs into the weber air filter.
It's not the most elegant, but it at least it connects these things together
in a way that at least made some sense to me.

If anyone has another approach, please let us know.

BTW, I have no idea what #3 is...
