My '71 has the same holes, but no stop.  I have noted that the cable has
quite a bit more travel than the carb needs to get to full throttle.  I
adjust mine so that the pedal hits the floor just before the bellcrank on
the carb hits its mechanical stop.

If the mechanical &quot;stop&quot; in the system is at the carb, you'll put a lot
more stress on the linkage, cable, etc.  Then you'll find yourself with a
broken cable in a parking lot in Elko, Nevada.  Don't ask me how I know
this :)

P.S.: I had a spare!

&gt; i found out what this wacky plastic gizmo is (part # below):
&gt; in the 68-70 manual it notes this as an accelerator pedal stop. never
&gt; seen/heard such a thing! have you? do other folks have them - are they
&gt; useful? i don't see holes in the floor for them in my 75, but plain as day
&gt; two exist in the 68. loopy.      - steve
