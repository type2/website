for the type I engine they are avaliable (think Bus Depot may have em)
for the type IV engine you have to make your own (if anyone knows of any
in the USA let me know)

I had to make mine, the exchangers were so bad I just chisled the
exchanger off the pipe.

&gt; &gt; &gt; take the heat exchangers off and replace them with muffler pipe? Will this
&gt; &gt; &gt; effect my engines performance? If I do one I will do the other too,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; yes you can replace with &quot;J&quot; tube
&gt; &gt; no it doesn't affect the performancee
&gt; &gt;  make sure the cooling system is intact
