Subject: '80 Vanagon winshield wiper pivot needed

Well, as often happens....

I was going over my new '80 westy (the one I asked
for sheet metal for) and I was removing the windshield
wiper arms to lube the shafts. While pulling the nut off
of the end of the shaft, it hit a little rust and twisted the
shaft threads right off. I didnt even turn it hard. 

So, now I cant have a left wiper arm. I need the new
shaft. The good news is that it is easy to get to behind
the instrument cluster and is the small part, not the part
with the motor on it.

Got one? Want to part with it?  I think that any Vanagon
part will work.

PS: I didnt go to the 'quickie lube' place that overfilled
the crankcase, blowing oil all through the vents. The
lady I bought the bus from did. It was pure Syntek
that I drained off almost of a quart of until the measure
was down below the top mark.
