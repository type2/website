Subject: another squeek.

Folks,
The squeek gremlins have visited me again, and I still haven't cured that
other squeek in the front suspension. If you hear a van going along the
street which sounds like a horde of mice, its probably mine.
This time its the fresh air fan in the heater box under the dash. (82
aircooled)
how easy is it to get this box out, so I can lubricate the fan bearings? Is
it just two screws, or do I need to pull the whole van apart?
Other squeek update....I've injected grease through the ball joint boots,
and I've squirted transmission fluid and &quot;Mr Sheen&quot; (lemon) over all the
rubber bushings, tie rod ends, and shock absorber mounts. Still The squeek
lives on! Perhaps there is a mouse sitting on top of one of the wishbones,
and every time I go over a bump, something moves and hits him on the
head?...
