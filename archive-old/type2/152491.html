Subject: Re: [T2] intake manifold

Tim,
I've also been in drill-land with no success. Since my wife takes
chemistry classes I asked her to bring some acid back from school :-)
Her teacher wasn't too fond of that option and recommended to &quot;spray
oven cleaner in the manifold to dissolve the carbon&quot;

Because i am faithful I tried that method and let it sit for a week.
FYI, it is not more efficient than the drill cable.

I'll do the acid thing one day but i went for a good used manifold in
the meantime.

- Arnaud
