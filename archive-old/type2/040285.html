Subject: RE: 76 westy No start after long trips???

&gt;  Sometimes after a long period of driving...ie: 2
&gt; hours or more my van will not start. Usually I am on the road for a few
&gt; hours then stop to gas up. When I go to start again nothing.
&gt; If i were to leave the van sit for awhile it would start after cooling
down.
&gt; Any sugestions? Any similar problems?


This is a known problem with a simple solution.  The starter in your bus is
not directly connected to the battery; rather, the cable goes from the
battery in the back, all the way to your ignition switch, and then back
again to the starter.  Over time, deterioration of the wiring and connectors
results in increased resistance, slightly reducing the amount of current
that reaches the starter.  When the starter is hot (after extended driving),
the solenoid housing contracts slightly, and there is not enough juice
reaching the starter to kick the solenoid.  When the solenoid cools down,
the problem goes away because less juice is needed to move the solenoid.

John Muir recommends a fix in the Idiot Guide (absolutely required reading
if you own a bus - buy it now!!), involving using a Ford style solenoid to
route the starter wire directly from the battery, using the ignition switch
as a trigger for the starter rather than actually feeding the main starter
wire through it.  99 percent of the time this solves your hot start problem;
if not, you need a new starter.

Bosch makes a relay kit for exactly this purpose.  Rather than use a Ford
solenoid (which is overkill and draws more current than neccessary), it
includes a relay for this purpose, complete with instructions.  Same
solution as the Muir fix, just a bit more efficient.  You just wire it to
your battery and starter.  Costs about $8.  Part number WR1 on my website.
This is a recommended modification for all 68-79 busses, since the problem
is common and is likely to hit you sooner or later.  Well worth the few
bucks it costs.

Meanwhile, if you get stuck, you can pop-start the bus, or else crawl under
it and give the starter solenoid a moderately hard whack with a hammer and
then try starting it again.
