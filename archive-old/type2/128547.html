Subject: Talking and visiting and off topics

I would like to invite you to a new Type2 member talk list. This new list is not made to compete with the Type2_dot_com list at all (jn fact I haven't even &quot;talked&quot; to the moderators about my &quot;idea&quot;) but rather a place to take the off-topic conversations and questions once the main list tires of them. 

Few rules: keep it legal, keep the flame wars in p-mail, mind your language a bit (young eyes sitting at the computer some nights with me). Lastly: no Type2 topics allowed. Talk Type2 topics here on Type2_dot_com. Once a topic is banned b/c it is off topic, take it to the Talk List please. We allow discussions on the Talk List that would never be allowed here. Jokes, religion, politics, hobbies, non-Type2 vehicles, current events, etc are all welcome. 

This format has worked well on another list I belong to. 

Remember: Type2 stuff here, everything else on the Talk List. If anybody just insists on discussing Type2 stuff on the talk list - you WILL be banned! &lt;grin!&gt;

C'mon over!
