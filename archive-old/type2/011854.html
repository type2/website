Hey there Volks,

I don't know what the big hoopla about this radio stuff is all about.
Big radios are for slammed H_at_nda's. I really don't see the point in
putting big dollars into a stereo setup in a bus, but that's just my
opinion. 

Doktor Tim had some good ideas w/ the audi/porsche setup (nice and
quite), and I do like my tunes (I play guitar), but I really tend to
agree with Charlie Ford's bus commandment #5.

5. Listen to your engine more than you do the radio.

The only reason I have a decent radio (cheap sony) in my bus is
because the PO put it in. My old 78 had what I like call an
&quot;anti-theft&quot; radio. It cost 19.99 and the pair of speakers cost the
same. Car stereo theives don't steal the cheap stuff. Only problem
with the sony is that I can turn up the volume enough to interfere
with hearing the &quot;normal&quot; bus sounds.

If you do put a nice rig in your bus, it's a good idea to keep it out
of sight. Keep it in the glovebox, and install a radio blockoff
plate.

Just my 2 cents...
