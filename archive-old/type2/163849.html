I usually check with _www.discountedwheelwarehouse_dot_com_ 
(http://www.discountedwheelwarehouse_dot_com)  then  go to Vehicle bolt pattern reference. Then pick 
the make of car. The thing to  remember is that most wheels on newer cars are 
front wheel drive. So like the 98  and newer Passat wheels sometimes the center 
caps don't fit without mods. I had  some 99 Passat alloy 7 spoke wheels. They 
fit perfect on a bus but, the centers  had to be bored out to make it past the 
front bearing housing and rear hub  spline. After boring them out the center 
caps didn't fit. Something to keep  in mind. A few Mercedes wheels I tried 
required longer bolts. One set I had to  make the bolt holes larger to allow the 
bigger bus lugs to go through. Alot of  that stuff requires mods that make 
them a little different than you think so be  prepared. If you find rear wheel 
drive stuff then you have less stuff to do.  Eurovan alloys look good might try 
and find some of them.
