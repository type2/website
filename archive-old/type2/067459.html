Hi, All!

I went shopping tonight with the kids. I don't think they could figure out why
Dad was so anxious to get to the toy store, not the least bit interested in
Snears tool dept.
Well, I got meself a #10 set o' the Micromachines. Contraband, you know. Illegal
stuff. Unauthorized reproductions. Amazing, really, considering VW of A's recent
stance on copyright infringement regarding the likenesses of their cars. What
the heck am I spouting off about? On the bottom of the box it lists the credits
and permissions granted from Porsche AG, Buick, Cadillac, pontiac, Chevrolet,
Chevy, Corvette, Camaro, Lumina, and Caprice. Just one glaring omission:
Volkswagen. Could this really be an unlicensed product? How long 'till VW of A
notices these toys and demands money? 
Along the same vein, while at the mall the kids and I got so see animated models
of whales, on loan/rent from a company called Dinomation or something like that.
Next to each whale model was a sign with the whale's vitals on it. Instead of
specifying the weight of each whale in pounds, there was a drawing in the bottom
left corner (al la Muir) of a balance, whale on one side, and a proportionate
number of VW Beetles piled up on the other. Cute. Kids and Beetles. Go together
like cotton candy and sticky fingers. Speaking of which, have you ever noticed
that kids *always* notice an old VW? Even when their parents pretend to ignore
it?

Just another sighting...
