Subject: Re: [T2] PB Blaster &amp; south Georgia

&lt;Where can you buy PB Blaster, other than from the company website?&gt;

You've got to find some of the local industrial supply houses folks. You can walk in those places and buy quantity and quality that you can not afford anywhere else. They've got sealants, thread lockers, gasket materials, oils, solvents, etc. etc. The FLAPS charge you for the convenience of being open at 8:30 PM. In many cases I beat the quality, quantity and price of a FLAPS once I know where to shop. The FLAPS often sell TINY quantities. Thinking threadlockers here. 

Yellow pages would be the best place to start. 

Chris
