Subject: RE: speaking of brake cylinders (64-70 made in taiwan?)

 &gt; If these are the Italian which I think they are, I think indeed they are
&gt; nicer than the Varga and maybe even ATE.  Funny thing their form
&gt; and make is a bit different than the OEM whereas the Varga is clearly
&gt; a rip using origional castings as mold patterns, but inside they are also
&gt; subtly different and nicer made.

Yes, those are the ones.

&gt; I know there isn't much to screw up on a brake cylinder but I'd sure hate
&gt; to be the tenth of the percent

In the very few failure cases I've noted it's been minor seepage, not
catastrophic failure.  This emphasizes the importance of checking your
braking system periodically, so as to identify any worn parts (not just
wheel cylinders) before they actually fail completely. Any sudden and
complete loss of hydraulic pressure can be dangerous, whether it be a brake
line puncture or a catastrophic wheel or master cylinder failure.  But a
sudden and complete master or wheel cylinder failure without warning is
extremely rare. Typically the part will start seeping fluid for quite a
while, which you may notice as a drop in fluid level or by inspecting the
part.

As I said we're talking very few failures here anyway.  I have had one ATE,
two Vargas, and one BiTV (Indian) wheel cylinder fail in the last couple of
years.  Considering that I sell about three times as many Vargas as the
other two, that ratio is pretty consistent with sales volume.  So far no
LPR's have come back at all, pretty impressive considering that for the last
year and a half I've sold more of them than all of the other brands
combined.

The point here I guess is that buying a good product is definately very
important, but to keep your bus safe, the most important thing you can do is
inspect it regularly.
