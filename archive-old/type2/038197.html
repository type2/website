Subject: CV joints

Hi all,

      I was fixing a split cv boot.  I found some wear on the joints but I
do not know what is acceptable.  I thought the balls would snap into the
middle cage.  Most of mine just fall out.  There are shiny spots on the
outside of the cage but you can't feel them with your fingernail.  There are
wear spots on the outside part of the joint where the balls ride.  These you
can feel.  Interesting thing,  one of the circle clips that hold the shaft
to the inner part of the cv was not there.  I looked for it in the greasy
flange but it wasn't there either.  Someone had to put it together that way.
Any insight  would be appreciated.
