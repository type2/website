Subject: Bumper Overriders, Looking for
Date: Thu, 11 Mar 1999 20:27:16 -0800
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hi Volks,

I'm looking for front and rear bumper overriders for my 71 Westy.  

I've seen a few fairly rusted ones at salvage yards which I could restore,
but the rubber pads are always badly cracked and the bolts too rusted.
Anyone that has a good set of these willing to sell them?  I would be
willing to pay a tidy sum for some really clean ones if I could find them.
I have seen some OK overriders on the road and I'm considering approaching
people in parking lots and offering to buy theirs.   It's a sad state I've
fallen to in my obsessive desperation to obtain these parts.

Does anyone have any ideas about how to make the rubber pads?  I have made
other rubber parts using 1/4 inch rubber sheets laminated with black RTV
silicone, cut to shape, and coated with black vinyl dip with good success.
Any information or advice would be appreciated.

Alan
71 Westy &quot;Pokey&quot;
