Subject: Re: [T2] Jump Starts and Turn Signals

[...]

&gt; This two unrelated questions, but here goes.
&gt;
&gt; First, this morining after my daughter's check up there was a lady whose
car
&gt; wouldn't start.  She asked me if I had any jumper cables.  Since my bus is
FI,
&gt; I was paranoid about jumpstarting anyone since I know all the warnings
about
&gt; frying &quot;the brain&quot;.  After I had her try to start it again, and there was
no
&gt; reaction in the engine at all, I told her I didn't think it was the
battery
&gt; since there was no sound like the engine trying to turn at all.  So, I
took
&gt; her and the kids to their house where she was going to call her husband.
The
&gt; question is: Can my FI bus just not receive jumpstarts, or I am not to
give
&gt; them either?

I have no problems jumping cars with my 77 FI Westy.



&gt; Second question which arose as I was driving to lunch with a co-worker.
My
&gt; turn signals don't turn off after completing a turn.  I had never given it
any
&gt; thought since I have always had to turn them off since I've owned the bus.
My
&gt; co-worker thought it was odd though.  Are they supposed to turn off on
their
&gt; own?

Yes they cancel. 2 things can be wrong: 1)The hub which holds the turn
signal/wiper switch has slid down or 2) the cancelling spring has fallen
off.
For the 1st one: Look between the steering wheel and the black section below
it. On the right side you will see the cancel leg. How much of a gap is
there? Barely any or over 1/4&quot;?
For the 2nd one: Get a 24mm socket. Remove the black horn button with a
little screwdriver. The silver ring STAYS on the wheel. Pop the button out
of the silver ring! Disconnect the horn wire. Remove the nut. You will see a
mark on the shaft and the wheel hub, indexing the position. Remove the
wheel, it lifts off with a little wiggle. On the right side you should see a
squiggly spring between 2 white plastic hooks. Is it there? Or is the bottom
hook broken off and the spring gone?
If it is still there, #1 is your problem. To correct this, look for the hole
in the left side of the black plastic hub. Inside the hole is what's left of
a shear bolt. The head of this bolt is gone. It is designed this way. The
head shears off when you tighten it. You need to remove it and replace it
with a Allen head bolt. To remove it: Get a narrow chisel, narrow enough to
fit in the hole. Get a big hammer.Hit the chisel enough to cut a groove in
the shear head for a big screw driver to fit in and turn the screw. Then
remove it and replace it with a 8 x 1.25 x 30mm Allen bolt. Before you
tighten the bolt, put the steering wheel back on and slid the hub up to the
wheel as far as you can. When you put the wheel back on with the index mark
matching, the wheels should be pointing straight ahead and the cancelling
lug should be on the right side.



&gt; The bus is '76 Westy if that makes a difference to any of this.
