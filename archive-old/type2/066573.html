Why not try disconnecting the main coil wire from the center of the 
distributor cap and ground it to the block, then maybe slowly pull it 
away from the block, creating a small gap. While you are doing this, 
someone is turning over the engine for you (Careful with that SPark 
EuGene!). If the spark is not bright blue or blue, or rather if it is 
very yellow, or orange, it may indicate that the coil is going bad. Also, 
by increasing the gap from the engine as you test fire it, it may 
slightly stress the coil (add more resistance) and make it harder to 
fire. Just realize that the coil on an A/C VW is not very strong because 
they rely on points (Strong coil or HIGH voltage coil would eat up the 
points pronto). Just thought I would put in my 2 cents and offer that as 
a simple test.
