Subject: 2.0 to '71 swap

    In my quest for finding ways to spend my free time, I'm considering
putting the 2.0 from my '75 in the '71 Westy my questions are as follows.

    First, it is a 2.0 from a '79, originally it had suffered an engine
fire, so I took the FI off and put on a Weber 2 barrel progressive.  The '71
actually has a transmission from a '68 in it because it was what I had handy
when 4th dropped. I have checked the archives, but can't seem to find what I
want.

    Can anyone help me figure out if this is a feasible swap. I could also
take the transmission from the '75 since I know it is geared better for the
2.0. But I don't know about the interchangability.

Any help is greatly appreciated, normally I just start tearing at stuff, so
this whole asking first thing is a big step for me.
