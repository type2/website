Subject: Heat and lack of....

I have been plugging away on my Westy and lurking in the background here
most of the time. Reading everyone's Q&amp;A has been a big help, along with the
Ratwell BAY FAQ which has made my life a lot easier. As cool weather starts
to set in, I realized I had not addressed the heater issue in the mighty
Westy yet. I have started looking at some of the gas heaters that pop up on
E-bay and other classifieds online. How hard is the install on one of the
Eberspacher BN2 heaters? Is there a difference on the install with a fuel
injection system because of the higher fuel pressure (if that has anything
to do with it.)? Does it piggy back on the existing fuel line or what? Also
- I have seen a huge range on price for the BN2s I have looked at, what is
street value on a kit with manuals and extra parts?
