Karl,

I did not reply because, as I stated before I am done with this topic please
end the pain.

Seriously folks, we sell 311 941 A head light switches for 68-70 and 211 941
531 E for 71-79 buses take it or leave it. I'm not asking anyone to buy
them, I'm just saying if you want one we have them.

Thank you and good night.
