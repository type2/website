Subject: Re: [T2] The Physics of Cooling

&gt; Why isn't temp a relative constant?  With increased RPM, the fan
&gt; would most certainly be turning faster, and the engine would be
&gt; enjoying a greater amount of cooling air, but would not the
&gt; engine also be creating equivalently MORE heat to be dissipated
&gt; (increased RPM = increased combustion).

you also have to deal with the wind resistance.
