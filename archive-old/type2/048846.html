Seriously It seems that within the limited scope of my memory that there
are perhaps 10-12 or more of us within the Dade-Broward oh ok and maybe
southern palm beach area. Id like to have everyones email addys and get
some contacts going. Maybe Ill start with an email newsletter so we know
whos who and what our deals are and see what develops.
