&gt;Has anyone had positive experience using Slick 50 or any of the
&gt;other teflon(or non-teflon) treatments in extending their engine's life?

Don't use it.  Or any other additives in your oil.  If that stuff was so
great and could actually extended the life of anything in your engine, don't
you think the car manufacturers would be using and recommending it?  They
don't.
