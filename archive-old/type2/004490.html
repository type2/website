When I went to the junkyard to look for a front axle for my 77 camper van
(steep mountain,no emergency brake.._dot_used a rock) I found a van that had the
axle I needed. While removing the axle I noticed that it had air
conditioning. I would like to go back this spring and strip all the AC parts
off it. The trouble is I know nothing about AC. Could some one tell me what
all the components are and where they are located...I beleive the van was a
&quot;72... I think I remember a component under the driver side wheel arch.

Also, an evil man runs the junkyard and charges a lot when I go out there
and strip stuff...what should I pay for all the components if i remove them
myself.
Thanks!
