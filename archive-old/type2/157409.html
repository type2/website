Subject: Re: [T2] Need Better Freeway Gears

Depends on where you live, Glen.  I used to spend a lot of time in  and out of Miami.  I can't imagine driving one on the freeways  down there.  Bumper to bumper at 85 MPH.  Or a dead  standstill.  I've never driven around crazier drivers than  there.  And I've driven in most of the big cities in the US.   But most places if you just stay in the right lane and do the speed  limit everything's fine.  Yeah, I've had an occasional honk of a  horn but then I just honk back with my stock beetle horn and the  classic, whiny litte beep-beep tends to disarm the situation.  A  smile and wave doesn't hurt either.  Hard to get mad at a VW bus  with a horn like that.  That's like getting mad a George  Carlin.  Cheers...KR

      Maybe this isn't the place to address the question, but it is a Friday...
so here goes.  I think the average speeds at which people-in-general are 
driving (on Interstate highways in particular) have increased.  It is not 
seemly to do an indicated 55 on a 55-limit road.  Yes, I know about speedo 
error.  What I see well exceeds any 10% effect.  I think many motorists have 
got the idea their relative 'invulnerability' is at a new high, perhaps due to 
anti-lock brakes, stability controls, air bags, etc.  Bottom line, I am not 
comfortable driving any vintage VW on freeways -- except at times when no one 
would be expect a need for speed, that is, getting to work (let's say).  Sorry 
for the pessimism, but IMHO the wonderful air cooled VW products are no longer 
suitable as daily drivers, if you have to drive on roads posted above 50 mph.  
Just my 2&quot; worth...... Glenn
