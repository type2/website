Subject: RE: [T2] turbo your heat.

Good to know... 

So do you think the marginal heat was a volume problem or a temperature problem or a combo of both? 

FWIW I saw a BIG difference in heat output between a low mileage '78 with the horseshoe 180 deg. bent pipes that still had the factory outer layer of metal and then the same bus a couple years later after the outer layer had rusted off. They really hang out in the wind and prob. really cool off the heat potential of the heater boxes.

IOW wrapping the pipes should make a huge positive difference BUT it's going to cut the expected lifetimes of the pipes to a season or two. I have a Corvair turbo crossover that was wrapped and the metal was seriously ruined. I can send picks to anyone that wants them... 

The low mileage '78 made good heat down to low temps (below freezing - 27 degrees) despite the low air volume.

I expect a '72-'74 system would be a good choice too if used with the '78 style flappers to keep the heads cool.  

My theory is that speeding the air through the heater boxes with aux blowers bigger than stock may limit the amount of heat transferred to the air. IOW the extra volume may only be useful to clear the windshield. 

Anybody want to pick this apart please? Enjoying the debate... 

Thanks Marcus! 

Chris

----Putting the bilge blower before the heater boxes only helps marginally.
