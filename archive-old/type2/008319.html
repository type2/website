Subject: Clutch Cable Adjustment
Date: Sat, 13 Feb 1999 09:11:59 -0600

Hello All --
I'm in the process of adjusting my clutch, as freeplay at the pedal is
getting a little out of spec.  Adjusting the thing is not a problem (except
for having to squirm under the bus and trying to use both arms once there)
-- getting it to stay at the proper adjustment once I've done it is the
thing.  I just did it 2 days ago and now it seems I've got too much free
play again.  Is there something I can do to keep the adjustment from
loosening?  There was something in the Bentley book about this (something
about &quot;engaging the recesses of the wingnut somewhere...&quot;), but the choice
of words they used was a little less than user-friendly in this case.  Can
anyone provide with any tips on this one?  Thank you once again!
