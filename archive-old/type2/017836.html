Subject: Westie pop-tops: sleeping 4 in a 74 vs.71?
Message-ID: &lt;372A4CD3.2C47BC2A_at_west_dot_net&gt;

The whole Westie pop-top is a land of mystery to me. I understand that
there's room for four in a '74.

Anyone have experience sleeping a family of 4 in a '71? How does that
work? What about two (male) fishing buddies who aren't terribly
homophobic but prefer not to sleep in each other's arms?

Some of your comments have encouraged me to widen my search to include
'71s--availablity of 1600cc parts sounds very appealing.
