don't let the foo foo birds get you down. You know as well as I that it's the 
vocal 2%'ers who disengage their brains and let their mouths roar. Your posts 
have always been the calming voice of reason to counter the lynch mobs cry of 
'string em up,'  I've enjoyed reading of your trials and tribulations. Maybe 
if you announce a change of heart, it will irritate the other party so much 
that he will unsubscribe ! (my guess is that like so many other flamers the 
coward is hiding behind a nom de plume)
