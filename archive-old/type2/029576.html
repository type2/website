&gt; The offending wire and spade connector were assembled at the BOSCH factory.
&gt; They don't appear to be soldered, and a check of several identical used and
&gt; new assemblies confirms no evidence of solder  -  just factory crimped.

Factory-crimped connectors are not soldered.  They use so much pressure to
crimp the things that the wire is intimately shaped to the connector and
vice-versa.  I've taken apart (by careful cutting with a Dremel)
30-year-old connections that were doused in oil for years and found the
copper wire in the connnector to be shiny and free of coorosion or other
contamination.  My conclusion is that the connection is as close to
perfect as it can get.

&gt; The wire did not come out of the terminal.  It broke at the point where the
&gt; wire enters the spade connector.

this is the usual failure point.
 
&gt; This was a new condenser/lead assembly, installed ~14,000 miles ago.  In all
&gt; the years I've mucked about with air-cooled VWs I've never seen a similar
&gt; failure.  Is this another evidence of the declining quality of BOSCH parts?

I doubt it.  More likely, the arrangement of the wire led to a chance
vibrational resonance where the wire flexed significantly at a certain
engine RPM.  This flexing failed the wire.  Unless it happens repeatedly,
I wouldn't blame Bosch.

I'm a great believer in the use of heat-shrink tubing over the connectors.
This gives some support to the usual failure point.
