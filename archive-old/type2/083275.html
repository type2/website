Subject: negative camber-what to do?

hello all,

i have negative camber in the rear wheels of my 76
Camper(as i'm sure many others do as well). it seems
to be worst in the rear passenger side wheel, however
they both look pretty bad. what can be done about
this. is there some sort of shims i can put in there
somewhere to straighten things out a bit?

thanks in advance. as always, any and all answers,
opinions, or insights will be greatly appreciated.
