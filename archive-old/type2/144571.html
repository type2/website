Subject: Engine conversion

Hello Everyone,
 
I am new to the list and I would like some advice.Upon returning to the US I will buy a baywindow bus, my question is what is the best engine to use in the van or single cab. 

 
Two questions:
 
1. Will the Jeep 2.5L fit under the engine top cover of a 68 - 79 vw van, or will I need to raise the access lid?
 
2. Is there a better engine to use that will fit my needs, while maintaining simplicity and reliability.
 
My thoughts are an engine conversion to a Jeep 2.5L . It will be used for hauling wood, plasterboard, stones, and other house renovation materials,  one part of the solution an engine with good low-end toque. 
 
Being retired and single I also like to travel, another desire is an engine that will maintain around 25 mpg at 60 to 70 mph on the highway. Here again I think the Jeep engine will fit my needs.
 
The final part is long term reliability and simplicity,  I am willing to sacrifice some  fuel consumption for simplicity, but I want to maintain at least 20 mpg on the highway. 
 
Thank you for your comments and advice.
 
Cheers,
 
Mark
