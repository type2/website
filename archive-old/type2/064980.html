Subject: Re: VWs at work

There is a import car repair place I drive by every day.  They 
generally have Mercedes and VWs in the yard.  This guy is a diesel 
nut and clearly prefers diesel to gas.  Anyway, he usually has a 
VW Rabbit or Golf diesel for sale.  He buys junkers and puts a few 
together and gets a good one out of them.  As for the subject heading 
relevancy, he has an old single cab (bullet style turn signals)
that he uses to haul the remnants to crusher with.  After he 
has stripped them he usually cuts them up and fills up the bed.  
The most recent load was an uncut Rabbit, it fit entirely within the 
bed.
