My friend is in Ithica NY and has problems with her '70( I think) bus.    She
drove it out east a while ago, but anyhow for various reasons the engine is in
pieces and she is told the engine case is bad, but not how.   It is my belief
that she would greatly appreciate knowing where there is a good machine shop
that deals with aircooled VWs in her area.   Or someone nearby with a good
case/ short block/long block/engine they could part with.  or some such.  she
is mechanically capable, but in need of assistance.   I believe the bus is in
Ohio.     The motor in pieces is an H case.    The bus has a borrowed motor in
it which threw a rod shortly after installation, so anyhow, the main thing is
she wants to get it running again, and maybe someone closer than across the
country like I am.

so do not respond to me,
