&gt;I think the &quot;wider 79 body&quot; is referring to the Vanagon-style body, which
&gt;started selling in 79 in other parts of the world.  I haven't noticed 79's
&gt;being any wider than any other breadloaves.

Aha! That sounds plausible.

Well, except that I thought the Vanagon body was a lot wider than the bay
body, more than the two inches or so claimed for the 79 bay?

(I have seen threads more trivial than this. Even been in on some. Yep, I
really have. ;)
