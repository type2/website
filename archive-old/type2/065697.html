Subject: YEARS AND/OR MODELS

Sorry to shout, but:
COULD WE ALL (me included) REMEMBER TO PUT THE YEAR OF OUR BUS IN ANY
MESSAGE DETAILING MAINTENANCE, ETC? Half of the time I see a good idea, or
someone posts a fixitbeforeitbreaks item, I go out to my 70 NONCAMPER LOAF
and discover that the poster must have a VANAGON. Or whatever; the point
being that VW liked to make lots of goofy changes in *everything* from year
to year - actually, having had two different 70's, I suspect they changed
things month to month! (I read all these procedures anyways, one never
knows what knowledge the future will require of you)
It just seems to be an obvious thing to be specific when trying to convey
information that a reader half a world away  might attempt to use to guide
them in a procedure.
- -Craig
70 neunsitzer
65 pritschenwagen
(see, can't rely on this part, either - most of us have at least TWO!)
((PS - not trying to be bitchy, just trying to be helpful))
