Subject: Axle nut size 80' Vanagon?

Anybody know what size the rear axle nut is on a 80' Vanagon? I'm 
heading to Mississippi tomorow to pick up a parts van {thanks for the 
lead Weston (remuse_at_aol_dot_com)} that has been 
sitting for a few years. I want to be sure the rear wheels will turn 
freely and may have to check the bearings. While passing through 
Alabama I'll see if I can register my find with Uncle Joel!
 Are you off  I-20 Joel?
