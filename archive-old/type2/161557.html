Subject: RE: [T2] Loose pushrod on a 75 auto westy

Wow, you're exactly where I am right now. Exact same symptoms. Result of a 
loose head. On #2 the lifter won't pull out with a strong magnet while all 
of the others will. It's probably mushroomed a bit on the cam side of 
things. I just got the engine out and on the stand an hour ago. Now to split 
the sucker open...... I'm hoping the cam's not damaged.....
