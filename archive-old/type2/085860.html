Subject: ??? Mystery Distributor



Hello all,
     Once upon a time I posessed a Bosch distributor that performed better 
than any distributor I had previously(and subsequently)ever used in my 
air-cooled VW's.  Her alphanumericals were such:
     JFUR4
     9 230 081 059
     IND BRASILEIRA
     040 905 205 6
     845

I attempted to come up with the origin of said dizzy, but came up clutching 
nada.  The item was dishonestly removed from my posession, and I am seeking 
a replacement.  If anyone out there can help, I would be forever(okay, maybe 
temporarily) in your debt!

     Eron
