&gt; I guess I should clarify. I had that bolt. It fell
&gt; off.  I tried to order a replacement (via Busdepot)
&gt; and found out it is now obsolete.  I was asking if
&gt; there is an after market fix that anyone might know of
&gt; or have come up with that I could use. I, at least,
&gt; need a temperary fix until I can get a new or used OM
&gt; bolt.  I would sure like my battery to be charging up!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Can I get a bolt at say a hardware store that will do
&gt; the trick and stay put? Any ideas? If so what should I
&gt; look for?

get a fine thread minimum grade three (5 is better) bolt the right size,
use a big enough washer (both sides) and pull her down real tight.
