So John Jensen says:
&gt; I've been vanless I've felt deeply homeless; and every van I passed on the
&gt; street felt like home.  A friend of mine says that his '79 westy is the only
&gt; thing which he has which is truly his own.
&gt; 
&gt; But despite all the wisdom, grace and reason of V W Van ownership, there is
&gt; still an element of madness to it.....  John Jensen in Annapolis

I know what you mean.  When I'm out driving, a VW passes.... I .._dot_can't..
keep...my...head..from...t..turning to look. Ugh!!  There, I said it!
I admit it, I'm addicted, but not ashamed like those folks in the Sugar
Frosted Flakes commercials. :)   I even keep parts in my garage from
the '68 bug I used to have.  I know I'll probably never use them again,
but I just can't let them go.....  Am I insane?  

Oh well....
