&gt; So, my #4 intake valve was tight. Seems I remember George Lyle asking

&gt; to
&gt; have tight exhaust, not intake, valves.

How tight is tight?  Did it close up a few thousandths or was it
metal-to-metal like mine?

Since my engine was tired anyway, I put in a new one.  After three full
days of removing, disassembling, cleaning, painting, reassembling, and
reinstalling I'm not in any mood to look at the offending head.  Ask me
in a couple of weeks :)
