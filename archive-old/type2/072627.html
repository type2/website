Subject: generic &quot;missing&quot;

My  newly rebuilt 1776 starts immediately and runs fine. Except for one
thing.  At low rpm, especially when climbing a hill, there is a frequent
symptom that I think corresponds to a &quot;miss&quot;.  Of course, now that I'm
driving the bus, I think back to when I ran the engine on a test stand and
heard a similar sound. In my haste to get up and go, I ignored it and stuck
the engine back in.

This got me to thinking.  What are the generic causes of a miss?  What
happens in the combustion chamber ?  Does a cylinder fail to fire when its
turn comes?  How does one go about diagnosing and fixing?

Thanks for any insight.

Jack
