First of all, why have the case align bored?  According to what I've read,
type IV cases almost never need it.  If you did everything else listed
above *except* for the counterweighted crank I would expect 100k+ miles
&gt;from the engine (except for possibly the cylinder heads).  

&gt;I am trying to decide whether the cost of a CW crank is justified by 
&gt;extended engine life.

It seems to be the general concensus that a counterweighted crank is not
really 
necessary (for engine longevity or anything else) unless you spin the
engine above 5,000 rpm.  However, I'm planning on getting one eventually
just because I like a nice, smooth running engine.
