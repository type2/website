&gt; What is the MAX PSI that these tires will take?  If they go up to 50
PSI,
&gt; then they are indeed the tires you want... what air pressure did you
put in
&gt; front and rear?

Nope, the low profile tires have a lower weight rating for a given
pressure and load range.  Terry's tires are load range C (I think),
and rated at 1435lbs at 50PSI.  This is too low a load capacity for a
bus by about ten percent.  If you run 195/75R14 tires, you have to get
load range D.

I learned the same lesson on my bus, and now insist on 185R14 tires. 
The 195/75s are used as chain tires in the snow.
