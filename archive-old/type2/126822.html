Subject: Re: [T2] Valves and TDC

Hello Guys     Sure fire way to find TDC  rotate the engine in its normal 
direction (Clockwise for VW) watch the number 1 intake go in then comes back out 
rotate about 90 degrees(1/4 of a turn)  till the timing mark on the crank 
pulley comes up to the timing mark on the case,this will be TDC . Now if you can't 
find the timing mark on the pulley use the pencial in the cly.  at this time 
check the dizzy and make sure it is on number 1 cly.   Later and have fun
