        Brian,
        Good question about the cam gear- and the cam/follower interface too.
The cam and related bits are semi-submerged in stock engine. I'm not sure oil
falling from the mains wouldn't be adequate- 'dry' sump is somewhat 
misleading- every drop the pump sends somehwere comes back to the sump, it
just isn't allowed to collect very deep there.

        The cam followers themselves are lubricated by pressure oil from 
the pump and they conduct more oil UP through the pushrods to the head.- 
yes. that's how it works- pull a valve cover and run the engine and it'll 
spray oil all over the place from the pushrod/rocker joint.

        Happy Motoring!
        Bill
