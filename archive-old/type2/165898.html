Subject: Re: [T2] Recall on LT Tires

On 2-Jul-07, at 10:00 PM, The Bus Depot wrote:

&gt; LT (light truck) rated tires from a Chinese factory, sold under a  
&gt; variety of
&gt; off-brand names, are being recalled. The belts were improperly  
&gt; bound and the
&gt; tread could separate.
&gt;
&gt; So far the recall involves tires sold between 2002 and 2006 under the
&gt; Westlake, Compass and YKS brand names. But the distributor  
&gt; indicated that
&gt; the same factory sold the tires to other distributors as well, so  
&gt; they may
&gt; also be labeled under other (as yet undisclosed) brand names.
&gt;
&gt; I do not know if this factory made tires in the popular Bus sizes  
&gt; or not,
&gt; but if you have off-brand tires on your Bus you'd better look into  
&gt; it just
&gt; in case.
