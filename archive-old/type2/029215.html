&gt;Did the Standard have the jail bars and the corner wrap around windows?

My 1971 Deluxe does not have corner wrap around windows or jail bars,
I don't think any bus post 67 has em

&gt; I've searched the archives and can't find an answer, so here goes. Can
anyone
&gt; tell me the differences between a 1971 Deluxe Bus and a Standard? I know
&gt; about the exterior trim, but is anything else different?
