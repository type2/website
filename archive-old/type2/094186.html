Subject: Re: [T2] Grinding into first

Your clutch cable may need adjustment, or replacement.  I have similar
symptoms and, so far, it has always been a maladjusted clutch cable.  I have
had a cable fail, the clevis pin had worn all the way through the end of the
cable.  Naturally, this caused a continuing adjustment problem as the cable
became essentially 1/4&quot;+ longer as it wore out.

&gt; List,
&gt; I am having a difficult time with the transmission in
&gt; my '72.  When I shift into first from a stop, it
&gt; grinds.  I can downshift into first when moving
&gt; forward slightly without any difficulty or grinding.
&gt; Also, when downshifting to second, it doesn't always
&gt; want to shift very easilty, it takes more force than I
&gt; want to give it to move the shifter into second gear.
&gt; I was reading Muir last night and he spoke of moans
&gt; and growls, I am assuming my grinding is related.  I
&gt; haven't yet checked the transmission oil level, I plan
&gt; on doing that tonight.  My question, if the level is
&gt; low, would that produce my sypmtoms, or am I looking
&gt; at a bigger problem inside the transmission?  I am
&gt; preparing myself for the worst.  If it is determined
&gt; that the transmission needs to be overhauled, how easy
&gt; is it to find a used or rebuilt tranny?  I would
&gt; likely opt not to have the current transmission
&gt; rebuilt and instead would look to replace.  Thanks in
&gt; advance, happy Friday...
