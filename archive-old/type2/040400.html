Hey, I'm new to the list thing and I have some questions about my bus that 
I've always wanted to ask, but could never find knowledgable people.  If any 
of you can provide some answers I'd be gateful.
I've got a '77 standard bus with about 60k miles on the second engine (2.0l, 
mechanical valves), and the original trannie, it runs better than any of my 
other cars.

My Questions
1. The gas question...is it really okay to run 87 octane?
2. Oil-I live in sacramento, where it gets about 100 degrees on average in 
the summer-I'm using strait 30 weight now-should I change?
3. Speed-How fast should I drive on the freeway-it screams past 60mph
5. I'm taking it in for a paint job in a couple of weeks..the right rear 
panel is pretty rusted out around the bottom and around the battery tray 
(pretty common I guess) but was fixed with some emergency bondo and primer 
during the winter-should I replace it with a new panel? How much does it 
cost? Considering I've got less than two grand for the body and paint, I need 
a cost effective solution.

Grateful for any help,
Matt S.
