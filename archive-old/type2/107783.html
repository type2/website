&gt; How can I check to see if my cold start valve is leaking??

You can, in theory, remove the cold start valve from the air distribution
box - with gas lines still in place - and then pressurize the system (I
jumper terminals 36 and 39 on the AFM plug) and watch the cold start valve
to see if it's leaking.  Kind of a PITA since the distributor gets in the
way.  You could also ground out the wire from the coil to the distributor
and then have someone crank the engine for a couple of seconds - thereby
engaging the thermo-time switch - and see that it's spraying at &quot;startup&quot;
and not leaking after the engine is no longer being cranked over.

&gt; I checked the library and read Sean Barnik's explaination on the thermo
time
&gt; switch and cold start valve. (Sean says, RE: Cold Start Valve - &quot;It can be
&gt; tested in the same manner as the other injectors. Leakage is undesirable
as
&gt; it will cause the engine to run rich.&quot;)
&gt;
&gt; I am wondering if I am getting too rich a mixture that is causing me to
&gt; stall when I stop the vehicle, or  slow to almost stop.
&gt;
&gt; I. e., 2 or 3 seconds later, after I stall, I get the smell of 'fuel' from
&gt; the defrost vents (wired for the winter, and the fan is always running,
warm
&gt; air from engine compartment to vents pronto.)
&gt;
&gt; I know, CSV only fires 10 secs max, and only when engine key is on start
&gt; position.  But Sean says the CSV gets it's electrical impulse from the
&gt; double relay, and if my termo time switch (ground for CSV) is also bad,
&gt; couldn't this cause CSV to dump fuel into engine??

Shouldn't.  Remember, although the CSV gets its power from the double relay
that power is &quot;stopped&quot; if the thermo-time switch isn't grounded.  The heat
from the engine opens the thermo-time switch, giving the current no ground
to flow to.

&gt; It could be that one went bad, and nothing reulted, but if the other went
&gt; bad also, I would be bonkers on my CSV.
&gt;
&gt; My motor is uncharacteristically cool.  In the Spring, it was running hot
as
&gt; a $2 pistol.  I found vacuum leaks, and thought that was my answer.
&gt;
&gt; Now, I am balking when I snap my footoff teh gas pedal at 60MPH, and
&gt; stalling just before I come to a stop.  Only when warm.

You might be suffering from a too-rich mixture, causing you to stall when
the engine is warm, but lots of things can cause this so I wouldn't focus
just on the CSV.
