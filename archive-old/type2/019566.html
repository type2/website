Hi list,

I recently started my bus after a summer spent looking for a solution
for a lack of electrical power to the injectors, turned out to be a bad
connection inside the wiring harness connector. Now The engine starts
great but dies after a minute or so unless I press the gas pedal. I am
hardly able to run up and down the street to the neighbour which is half
a km away.

Any idea what could cause the engine to die like that - where should I
start to look? Could it simply be the fuel filter that I changed 2 km
ago? The engine is a 2L EFI. (1978) Could this also happen if cylinder 3
had no compression (the PO suspected that).

The engine also runs better when the distributor is turned counter
clockwize until the UFO thingy on there is blocked the cold start valve
electric wire and connector. Could the distributor shaft be improperly
placed?

Thank you again, specially the people of the list who taught me how to
test a double relay!
