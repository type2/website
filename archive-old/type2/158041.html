Subject: Re: [T2] Pics of the dangers of a front mounted spare

Being in the collision business for 30 some years gives me plenty of
evidence, and time repairing this type of vehicle to tell you flat out
John that they are unsafe at an speed in a head on wack--spare tire or
not.

And I'm going to refer to them as  COE    ( Cab Over engine ) designed
vehicles--
Just as a semi tractor is built---
You sit over the steer axle--and you lose in a frontal collision.
Period.

Hang what you want up on the nose.

Whatever you have hung will take the initial tap--and from that point
on--the driver, the passenger, and whatever else is behind the collision
is gonna get it.

Now--I have no idea where you came from on this subject--but let me tell
you this--- it's a very poor design for creature safety regardless where
your sitting, or what or where you have swinging out in front of the
vehicle.

Period.

Nothing more.

How did Ralph Nadar miss these things?

I rather get nose wacked driving a Crosley than a Bus--no doubt.
