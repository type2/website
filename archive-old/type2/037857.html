Subject: Nice Westy for sale in Salem Oregon

Hell all,
  I was in Salem Or. tis weekend and saw a real nice 77 Westy, sage green with that green plaid interior. I checked it out and it was in great shape. It included the childs cot, small table, swingout table, and stool. It was a delux(I guess) with the propane stove and frige on the left side. I did not find out the asking price because they were closed. It did have a new paint job that looks real good, but it did cover up a small amount of rust by the rear wheels. The nose was never hit and has no bondo. 
  I have no conection with this Bus, just saw it in a lot and wanted to pass it on. p-mail if you want more info.
