Subject: Re: Further to: Strange Cylinder Wear

Hey Karl, thanks for the quick reply.

I was specifically referring to the &quot;half-moon&quot; which is visible on the top
side of each picture.  It just didn't look right, as the long and square
cutout was pretty neat, but the half-moon cutout on the far side is kinda
jagged ---- it's unique to each cylinder.

Thanks,

Justin

&gt;
&gt; Are you meaning the cut-out on the bottom edge of the cylinder? One side
is
&gt; long and square, the other a half-moon?

&gt;
&gt; Now I am a little confused. Seeing this pic I didn't see anything wrong.
&gt; Then I reread your original message. Is what you are looking at the cut
out
&gt; for the rod to clear the bottom edge of cylinder as the crank turns?
&gt;
&gt; Do you have a 68-79 Bentley?  If yes: go to section 5, page 44, figure
13-3.
&gt; There is nothing wrong. That is the way they are made.
