Subject:  idle/deceleration problem  and choke setting
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Greetings again...

Ahhhhhh... Persistent troubleshooting... My favorite activity (or should I
call it inexperienced troubleshooting?)...  I have a '71 bus with a dual
advance dizzy and a 34-pict 3 carb.  I have new points, timing is 25 deg
total advance, new condensor, new plugs, dizzy cap, rotor, wires are fine.
I'm pretty sure these are both carb problems, but I'm at a loss....

Problem #1:  Choke setting

	Symptom:  Bus stumbles and dies while warming up.  I can't get the engine
to start w/high rpms and gradually work down the idle cam.  I have to keep
my foot on the accelerator to keep the engine going while warming up.

Solution:  Right now it's revving the engine to 1500 -2000 rpms until the
engine will stay running on it's own. I'm sure that an incorrect choke
setting is mostly responsible, but can't seem to get the correct setting.
I've set the choke so that the choke coil/spring catches the butterfly valve
arm and then I wind it counterclockwise about 150 degrees to the point where
the lines on the choke and choke housing match up.  The butterfly valve is
completely closed in this position.  This proved ineffectual in delivering a
normal startup and warmup.  The bus choked and died on it's own.  So I've
proceeded to slowly turn the choke clockwise so that the butterfly valve
begins in a slightly open position when cold and I've set the cam by pushing
the acclerator pedal.

My question is:  What's the correct setting for the choke? I've read Bentley
and Haynes and feel like I've followed their instructions for setting the
choke.
Could my throttle positioning screw be set wrong?  Should the screw be set
when the engine is warm or cold?  I've been setting the screw when the
engine is warm and the screw is on the lowest cam setting.

Any other thoughts on this?  It's not a very complex system and I am quite
puzzled.

Problem #2:

Symptom:  Upon decelerating/coasting to a stop, the engine dies.  The engine
acclerates marvelously without hesitation, stumbling, etc. when warm.  And
there is plenty of power.  It just won't hold an idle, most of the time (I
say this because there are instances when the engine will actually
decelerate and hold the idle).  On the odd occasion (and I can't pattern
when it will idle and when it won't) that it does idle, the idle is a very
smooth, quiet 900 rpms.  I can barely detect any movement in the case and it
purrs in these seldom and precious occasions.  Based on this observation, I
feel I have the idle speed screw set correctly.
There doesn't appear to be a vacuum leak.  I've sprayed carb cleaner on all
the obvious potential vacuum leak sites and found nothing.  And pressing on
the brake pedal doesn't seem to cause a problem, which leads me to think
that my vacuum brake assist is in fine working order.

Solution:  No idea.  Could it be related to problem 1 somehow?


Any thoughts/ideas/solutions would be much appreciated...

Cheers,
