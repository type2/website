&gt; Thimking to score a gallon of it, run the tank down and/or drain it, and
&gt; give it a dosing it will never forget...  Looking for approximate ratios
&gt; here, plus a maximum &quot;not to exceed&quot; concentration limit of
&gt; gasoline:isopropyl if anyone happens to know...

Well, the isopropyl you buy at the drug store is 70%.  That may or may not
be saturated, but let's say that it is just for argument's sake.  The
&quot;drying&quot; version is 90 or 95 percent.  The difference between these is
about 25%, so it would be reasonable to say that each ounce of alcohol
will absorb a quarter ounce of water.

There is a fair amount of sump space below the outlet in a gas tank.
Getting the alcohol down there is pretty tough, and you can be spitting
water for some time even with dryers.  Does this tank have a removable
outlet like my '71?  If it does, pull the outlet and flush it with a
couple of gallons of fresh gas.
