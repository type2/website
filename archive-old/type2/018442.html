&gt; I just wanted to thank everyone for their advice on my earlier e-mail. I
&gt; definetly will stick with the 1600cc engine ( if i can lay my hands on one)
&gt; and the upper bunk thing just a fleeting thought, that now has passed.
&gt; 
&gt; The next issue is if I can put a type 1 1600 in my camper? If so are there
&gt; any considerations here?

Melissa:
The 1600 that came new in your 71 was, for all purposes, a type 1
engine. It was equiped with waht is called a &quot;universal case&quot; which
provides the bosses and the holes for the 3 bolts which attach to the
rear engine hanger (called a mustache bar cause of its shape). The front
piece of engine tin and the heat exchangers and muffler are different
&gt;from bugs, too. Some bugs came with the bosses on their cases, many bugs
now contain engines rebuilt with universal cases, so it's possible to 
install an engine from a type 1. In addition, there's an adapter bracket
available as well, but I'm not a great fan of them, but it might make a
but run where it wouldn't otherwise.
