Subject:  [T2] RE: fire extinguisher info wanted 

I carry a 5 pound CO2 extinguisher, either sitting on
the back seat of the 65 Double cab or between the
seats on the 75 bus, where I can grab it quickly as I
get out the driver's door.  Also have a smaller ABC
dry extinguisher behind the driver's seat.  Luckily,
have never had to use them.  I feel that the CO2 has
the usefulness of a halogen and none of the
environmental drawbacks, and it also isn't as messy as
the ABC dry extinguisher which leaves messy white
powder all over after use.
At work, we have fire extinguisher training every
year, which gives me a chance to actually use a fire
extinguisher on a pan of gasoline, which at least
gives me a feeling for what the extinguisher does. 
I'd recommend any kind of fire extiguisher use to
anyone, just to get a little practice before a &quot;real&quot;
fire.
