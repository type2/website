Subject: Update on SVDA with Kadrons (aircooled_dot_net vac port)

------=_NextPart_000_0053_01C24E6F.E8AB9310
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I now have www.aircooled_dot_net SVDA installed with my newly drilled vacuum =
port on my Kadrons from aircooled_dot_net, too.....here are the results.  =
Remember, before this upgrade, I had a 1776 with 009 and =
pertronix........ran great.._dot_carbs completely dialed in.

&gt; Back to the svda  I find that the acceleration off the line is like =
night
&gt; and day vs the 009.  And my 009 ran well.......I run about 20 degrees
cooler
&gt; at 75 mph, and around town, I never hit 80C on my temp gauge.  AT =
75mph, I
&gt; hit 95C and that is in 90+ degree weather.

It is worth the money..and one more thing.......be sure to mount the  =
kad with tithe vacuum nipple on the right side........
