Subject: Re: [T2] '71 Brake Pressure Regulator - anyone have an extra?
  or  solution?

&gt; Hello everyone, my brakes went out on BusZilla (rather sticking to the
&gt; floor) i made it home 25 miles - when i got underneath the pressure
&gt; regulator - i belive that regulates the pressure between the front and rear
&gt; brakes is covered in brake fluid - before i take it out - I was hoping
&gt; someone could give me a hint on either how to fix them, they are NLA, or if
&gt; someone has a good used one available.

These things don't go out very often.

Make sure that it is really the regulator.  Have someone step on the brake
while watching to see where the fluid comes from.  It is more likely to be
a line.

If you need one, BustedBus will probably be able to help you out.

George
