Subject: noise from tranny after engine reinstall

Hi Volks,

Well, finally got my engine back in and started.  Woo-eee!

The only problem is that when I started then the engine
I heard a high pitched &quot;tick&quot;ing coming from the engine
compartment.  When I push in the clutch, this noise goes
away, which searching the archives leads me to believe
that I've either got a bad throwout bearing or that I've
not torqed the pressure plate correctly.  I believe
I torqued the pressure plate properly -- different patterns to
different torque according to Muir -- but as far as i can
tell, my thowout bearing wasn't making any noise before
I took the engine out, so I'm confused that it would &quot;go&quot;
when I put the engine with new clutch plate in -- then again,
my engine was super loud then because of exhaust leaks
and a straight pipe for a muffler.

So, my questions are:

1) could i have mated the tranny/engine improperly and caused what
	was a good throwout bearing to rub and make noise?  or 
	something else to rub?

2) is it more likely that I put on the pressure plate improperly?

3) if i've only run the engine for ~5 minutes and haven't had it in
	gear -- is it likely I will have to put in a new T/O bearing
	or should that not have caused much harm?

It looks like I'll have to pull the engine regardless, so I'll probably
just put a new T/O bearing in anyway, but the fact that the tranny
wasn't making this noise before I reinstalled the engine makes me
think that there's something other than the T/O bearing that's &quot;not right&quot;
here. 

any thoughts on the matter are appreciated...as i said, I searched the
archive but didn't come up with anything where an engine started to make
this sound after reinstall.

thanks again!
