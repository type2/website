Subject: Re: [T2] Vacuum lines unclear

Thanks so much for the links and descriptions. They
quicky resolved all but on of my hoses.

Here is the descrition of the mystery hose;

The larger--aprox. 1/2&quot;--vacuum line from the Tee,
coming out of the air distributor, that goes through
the fire wall tin and to the brake booster has a
plastic Y in it about 12&quot;-15&quot;  forward from the
firewall. The Y partion of this is a 3.5mm hose
pointed back towards the engine compartment. There is
another inline componant just before this location
that I believe is a one-way gate to block pressure
from a backfire from entering brake booster. 

Any Ideas where this smaller hose goes?

Once again, Thanks so much for the previous links.
They are must have book marks!
