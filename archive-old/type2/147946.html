Subject: Re: [T2] Heat And Muffled Backfiring

 &gt;Thanks for the info! I had a couple of other people e-mail me and told me 
more
or less the same thing. That I would in fact be better off installing the dual
carbs. I'm curious... you said that your fuel pump isn't sufficient enough to
power the dual carbs. Are you using the stock mechanical pump? I don't
currently have a mechanical pump installed on my car and instead use a
Purolator &quot;Bug Pak&quot; fuel pump. It's labelled as a &quot;Bug Pak&quot;, but it looks
identical to the Purolator pump that I pulled off another car that I stripped
(76 Camaro).

Reading your response I realised that I should have made it clearer that my 
original fuel pump is on the way out and that this is the reason it cannot 
cope with dual carbs. A stock mechanical pump in good condition can of 
course supply dual carbs! Sorry for the confusion. :)

 &gt;Do you think that is sufficient enough to be used with my dual carb setup?

Yes.

 &gt;What kind of vacuum advance distributor would you recommend for this 
setup? (I
have an 1800cc motor).

I would recommend a new Bosch SVDA (single vacuum dual advance) as the best 
budget distributor.

Cheers,

Martin.
