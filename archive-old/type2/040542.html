&gt; What weight oil?

Funny you should ask... After sending my post, I
called my local VW FLAPS guy, and he asked the same
thing.

20w-50 was the answer. He said that was probably it,
and I should change to 30 or 40w. He used to race
VW's, so I trust him (hey, he coulda tried to sell me
more than oil, right??;-).

So, I drained my old oil, put in the 40w and gave it a
trial run. Cold idle:40psi on my pressure guage. Warm
idle:10psi....both normal. Ran at a steady 35psi the
whole time, even at 210 degrees oil temp. Seemed to
idle and run more smoothly, but when I took it on a
trial run up/down the hill that I travel to
work....same thing. Oil light on (not flickering) at
idle, and oil pressure barely hovering over *ZERO*!

Now, the slightest pressure on the gas pedal makes the
pressure come up and the light go off, so it's
*possible* that my idle's set too low. But if that's
the case, why does this only happen after highway
travel, not around town?????

I'm confused!
