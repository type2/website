Subject: RE: valve covers

Jason Antolovich asked me a few questions about how to do the valve covers, 
and so I thought I'd share this response with the list:

Jason,
I am not familiar with the rubber gaskets; are they a VW factory part?
I believe that the bale wire shape and strength was designed for a stiff 
material like cork, rather than a softer rubber material, which would cause 
the pressure at the interface between the gasket and the metal to be 
reduced, and thus to leak.
The wheel bearing grease on the surface of the cork gasket (very light 
coating, just enough to put a grease film on the cork; not enough to make it 
slippery) came from the Sean Bartnik archive on the type2 home page. I tried 
it the last time and it seems to work to prevent leaks from starting when 
you apply a new gasket. The RTV sealant is creates a problem at time of 
removal, you have to clean it off the mating surface). It isn't necessary 
with cork and grease as describered here.
The &quot;gentle pry the bail wire&quot; was meant to encourage you to avoid denting 
the surface of the valve cover or bending the bale. What I use is a brake 
lever adjusting tool, a rod with an angle bend at each end (different 
angles) such that you can place the elbow of either end's bend on the valve 
cover and the flat end of the bent rod under the bail and then gradually 
lever the bail up into its groove in several steps (moving the elbow a bit 
to a new position to get the proper leverage as the bail slides up to its 
slot). Always have bail wire down when you begin, and thus lever it up into 
its slot in the cover. Remove in the reverse direction (downward). You'll 
find that the easier direction. Before you begin, carefully clean the mating 
surfaces so that they are dry and smooth, use a new lightly greased cork 
gasket, and hold the valve cover horizontally as you bring it up to the 
cylinder head and then gently rotate it to vertical against the cylinder 
head so that the gasket stays properly in the groove when applied to the 
mating surface at the cylinder head. Check that the valve cover is centered 
on the cylinder head (there is a small amount of free play to slide it from 
side to side, up and down) and hold it there while beginning to ease the 
bail wire up onto the cover with the brake adjusting tool lever.
That is how I do it, and it seems to be effective.

&gt;Thank you for the info.  I have a few questions about what you said though.
&gt;First, why should i use cork instead of rubber i've always heard that the
&gt;rubber gaskets are better than the cork?  Second, why should i use wheel
&gt;bearing grease and not gasket sealant?  Third, how can you gently pry the
&gt;wire bale it is a pain to get pried back over the covers?  Thanks for your
&gt;help.
