Subject: JC whitney oil pressure and other guages

I've searched the archives, but can't find much info on these.  
I want to install Oil pressure, maybe volts, and a small tach in my 71 westy 
with a 1600.  My questions:  has anyone used the 2 1/16 guages from JC 
Whitney in a VDO rubber under-dash mount? I currently have a VDO oil temp, 
and it fits so nice in there.   2.  Concerning oil pressure sender - jc says 
a metric conversion kit is needed, but I've read that the hole is 1/8 NPT, so 
I'm assuming no conversion is needed? 3. Also, for the sender on my engine,  
a regular 1/8 T should be all I need to run the idiot light, and the new 
pressure guage sender, right?  I've read alot about cutting tin, but I 
believe that is referring to the pancake engine.  I'm fairly new to VW's, and 
sometimes get my wires crossed on all the names and nicknames for the various 
engines back there.

If my assumptions are correct, this entire operation will only cost me about 
the price of one VDO tach, but I also realize you get what you pay for.

Any help appreciated
Thanks
