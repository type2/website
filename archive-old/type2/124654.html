Hey Kurt,

What kind of camper do you have? Westfalia made the Campmobile, officially,
and ASI made the Riviera. The 72 Campmobile had the sink/icebox setup but I
don't think there is a resource for a reproduction icebox. Do you need the
whole thing (missing) or just parts of it. You can still buy the sink pump
and assorted things at www.gowesty_dot_com If yours is gone entirely you could
try www.bustedbus_dot_com or a junkyard for a unit.
As for the Riviera I am not as familiar with the ice box setup. You might
try posting a wanted ad on the Samba. Where are you located? Maybe someone
on the list has one. I have one from a 72 Campmobile in pretty good
condition. It's in Charlotte, NC.

The type 4 engines were all the same physical size...just different bore and
stroke so it will fit ok. There are some things you have to consider though.
The flywheel will need to be moved over to the new engine and the heat
exchangers/exhaust were different. You can put your old heat exchangers on
the 79 2 litre. There are probably some other things that others will
mention.
