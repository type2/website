Hello All,

I don't really have a name for my bus, but sometimes call it &quot;Ralph&quot; after my father-in-law who bought it new in 1968 and gave it to my wife and I (I've done most of the work on it since...)

My license is &quot;68BULLI&quot; after the German nickname for the bus.

Markus
'68 7-seater
