Subject: Re: [T2] 000 091 232 Winter Air-Intake Covers, thoughts?...

&gt; They are little removable covers for 73-79 busses, and they have a very
small
&gt; intake, leaving most of the vent closed off.
&gt;
&gt; Looks pretty cool, even for novelty sake. I wonder if this would be a poor
&gt; mans fix for those with removed thermo flaps, and for possibly helping to
aid
&gt; warmer air into the blower for the heat.

1) 73-79 buses in the USA are type IV engines. Anyone that removes the flaps
on one of these engines needs to have their head examined!!

2) If you are talking about closing off the air intake vents in the top rear
corners..... ????
I am lost as to how the engine will get fresh air to breath?
