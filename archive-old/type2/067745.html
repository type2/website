&gt;now, i understand that any buisiness can mess up an order. but the
&gt;i'm not the only one on this list to have trouble with parts
&gt;place. many have.

This was my only experience with them also.  I called and ordered a
book, and they shipped the wrong book.  I even had the guy read me the
part number back after he wrote it down, and I still got the wrong
thing.  They didn't give me any hassle about returning it, but
geesh...  By the time I paid to send the wrong book back, I could
have bought it cheaper elsewhere.

Later,
