Subject: Need help in Flagstaff, AZ

Hello list,

I'm new to the Type2 list. Have been on and off the Vanagon list for
about a year. Have owned air and water-cooled Vanagons and hope to be
the owner of an early 70's camper some day (as soon as I sell my '84
Westy).

But, the reason I am writing today is to ask for help for a couple I ran
into the other day traveling from New York. They have a '71 bus with
what they think to be a thrown rod and a short supply of cash. If anyone
out there knows of a good air-cooled mechanic in the area of Flagstaff,
AZ or feels competent enough to do such a job you can call them at
845-774-0708 (this is a cell phone), or you can email me and I will get
the info to them.

Peace - donna
'84 Westy - Pepe
