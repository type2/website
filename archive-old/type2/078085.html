Subject: [T2] Brake servo &amp; A/T vacuum


&gt; On the main (13mm) vacuum line to the brake servo ther is a small &quot;t&quot;
after
&gt; the check valve with a small (2-3mm) hose coming from it. Does everyone
have
&gt; this and does anyone know where to connect it?

I believe that this is for the manifold vac (retard) for the dizzy.  What
carbs do you have?
&gt;
&gt; I have a 73 with Automatic trans.  Does any one know if the vacuum valve
in
&gt; the trans gets manifold vacuum or throttle vacuum?

Manifold vac.  I cobbed together a &quot;T&quot; from some brass fittting (no plastic
to be found) to go from the 1/2&quot; to the 1/4&quot; vinyl reinforced hose I used.
(See in the archives the recent postings of Mr. Eric Raits re: this, or
p-mail me if you don't have any luck calling them up. I've got 'em
somewhere.)

&gt; Maybe thats what the small hose off of my brake vac line goes?  the
&gt; connection to the trans valve seem larger like 10mm

1/4&quot;  works nicely and is available at your local home depot, etc.

Good luck.
