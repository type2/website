Subject: RE: Where propane in Canada
Date: Tue, 24 Oct 2000 11:54:03 -0500


&gt; This low capacity is why I decided to go with a gas heater rather than
&gt; propane.  A gas heater takes about a gallon a night, and with a couple of
&gt; spare gas cans, you could take an extended trip in a cold place without
&gt; having to worry about running out.  Plus, when you do run out, how far do
&gt; you have to drive to get propane?  What if you're in Alaska or Canada?
&gt; You can get gas just about anywhere but propane is a little more
&gt; difficult.
&gt; 
	[Crick, Bill ]  Propane is real easy to find in Canada. I'd guess
about one out of
	three gas stations have it. Most taxi's, and a lot of delivery
fleets run on it.
