Hi Mike,

If the rest of the connections are the same to sensors, valves, and switches, and you've checked in a parts catalog to see if the sensors, valves, and switches were not changed over that same time period, I'd give it a try.

I have the luxury of a 4-gas analyzer though.  Once installed, Adjust the CO. Avoid running too lean.

Keep smiling,

Mike
