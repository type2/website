Subject: 84? vanagon for sale cheap!

My friend Dave has to sell it and is willing to make a deal.  He has it 
posted for over $300, but I know he will go much much lower than that.  
He's willing to practically give it away.  From what I understand, the 
engine is fine (wasserboxer) but the transmission linkage needs to be 
hooked up.

I've posted some photos up athttp://fatmedia_dot_com/dave/84-vanagon.jpg 
and http://fatmedia_dot_com/dave/84-vanagon-2.jpg

Call him for details.
