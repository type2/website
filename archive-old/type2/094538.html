Subject: Re: [T2] Are these new or restored? - 2002 Type 2

These vans have actually been around for several years in brazil.  They 
do not meet import requirements for the US or Canada by a long ways.  
They would have to be sample crash tested here in the US and from emails 
from people familiar with the standards &quot;no way&quot; was the chances of ever 
even being tested.  The type 2 standard design would have to changed in 
to many places.  I went down and looked at a current eurovan to get an 
idea.  &quot;No way&quot; is probably correct.  as for doing as is done with &quot;mex&quot; 
beetles, using a registerable pan and &quot;restoring&quot; it, this i was told 
could be done if you could get the parts to here in the us.  &quot;kits&quot; 
(like the old puma) in certain forms might be able to be created.  not 
sure of the current rules on them.
