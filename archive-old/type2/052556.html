Subject: [T2] Re: [type2-temp] RE: [VB] Time for a new welder

I have a Millermatic 250,220 volt, bought in 92, have installed 1 liner and
nothing else , other than consumables since then. I also have 2 miller 130,
xp's 110v, 1 of them is 3years old , have replaced nothing except
consumables in it, the other is used and needs a liner at this time ,(some
idiot kinked it i think), i also recently bought a Lincoln weld pak 100, a
good welder but i just prefer the Millers. Its mostly a personal thing i
guess. I investigated the century,daytona and other welders before i bought
the 1'st 130, i wasn't impressed fiber drive wheels and such didn't appeal
to me, when i bought the lincoln in dec i think there was 100.00 difference
between it and the 130 plus the regulator. so i took the cheaper way out. Go
on spend the extra get a miller or lincoln, dependability will save you in
the long run,,my .02 later
