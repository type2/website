Subject: Re: Panel surgery - where to buy?

&gt;So that's my question, I guess... who should I buy them from? Right now,
&gt;the only catalog I have with panels in it is JC Whitney... I know a lot
&gt;of people have bad stories about them, but I've never really had a
&gt;problem...

I've heard that Das Bulli Haus is pretty good for panels (at least for 
splitties). I'm not sure of how well they handle loafs. Check 'em out 
though:

Das Bulli Haus
18 Ward Lane
North Franklin, CT 06254
Wk: (203) 642-7242

I think that Thom Fitzpatrick's web page also has some links to theirs.
