Subject: [T2] A Couple of Friday Stories

OK, first story, a little background: Had a '76 Westy for 3 years, 1997 to 
April 2000. My daughter was 4 when I bought it, now she's 7. The day I sold 
it she cried and cried. A couple of weeks ago my wife was cleaning her room, 
found a picture my daughter had drawn of my old Westy with her standing next 
to it with tears rolling down her cheeks. Very touching. Anyway, just bought 
another one, this time a '77, which leads to the second story. Every night 
this past week I've been doing little things to the '77, last night decided 
to lube the sliding door track ( I think it was last lubed in 1977) I started 
to remove the track cover to get better access to clean/lube things, and it 
came off pretty easily, but I was quite surprised when, as I put my hands up 
under the cover to lift it off, I felt something crawling across my fingers! 
A nest of yellow jackets! Luckily because of the cold temps they were moving 
pretty slow. Never expected that! Take care everyone, have a nice weekend.
