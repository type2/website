        I would think that some judicious use of an ammeter could give
you some more clues.  I think (as if you asked;) that I would charge up
the battery and install it.  Turn the car off.  Remove one of the main
battery terminals &amp; put the ammeter in series between that terminal and
its battery post.  If something's draining it, you'll measure a current.
(Apologies; haven't caught the previous posts.  I assume that it drains
itself overnight when the bus is turned off?).  O.k., got something?
Start removing the fuses one by one.  Heck, I'd not put any back until
I'd had them all out just to be sure.  If it's somehow something that's
going through the fuse box, you should be able to narrow down where it's
coming from; when you pull that fuse, you'll break the mysterious circuit
&amp; the meter will read 0Amps.

        At least, that's what *I'd* try. :)
