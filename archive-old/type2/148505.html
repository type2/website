Subject: Re: SeaFoam to free stuck engine- +qu for G. Lyle

Refrigeration oil is light (pale?) and it's lubricating ability isn't
affected by the solvent properties of refrigerants. It might be useful
in making your own homebrew Seafoam. I used a cup of Seafoam with an
oil change to quiet noisy lifters and half a can in the gas tank for
fuel system cleaning. Seems to work well.

Happy New Years!
