&gt; part of the cable is okay.  If so, why does it keep coming off?  Thanks for
&gt; the help.

I always remove the arm attached to the pedal to do this; its always been 
so much easier that way.  Its been a while since I've done it (meaning 
I'll break mine on the way home now!) so the details are not real clear.
Basically I unbolt the little arm that holds the cable, install the cable,
and re-bolt it.  The pin goes thru the hole, then the clip part comes
around and clips on, keeping it in place.  And I think its a 17mm
nut that holds that little arm on.
