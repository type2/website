Subject: LiMBO on Long Island, first notice

Hi folks,
    As the snow melts away and the weather warms up here on Long
Island, NY the Bus Alliance is planning it's 3rd annual campout.  Mark
your calenders for the weekend of June 6th. 7th and 8th.  Just make
sure to mark it in pencil, as the date isn't set in stone just yet.
I'll give you all more info as it becomes available.
