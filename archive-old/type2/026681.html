...The business of VW jumping on every website with VW in its name is
probably due to a combination of corporate suspicion of anything
associated with the internet and the relative ease of searching for
&quot;VW&quot; and variations thereof.  There are people out there who make
their livings by seaching the net for references to companies, people,
etc. and reporting their results to clients.  Some corporate suit got
a burr under his saddle and spread some grief because it was easy to
do so.  I would be extremely surprised to see VW going after an individual
making one copy of an obsolete manual for private use.  VW would have
nothing to gain by this, as they are already publicly defending their
trademark and copyright in other cases...

That's right George, legally, companies must take some sort of action to
 prevent the use of their names to prevent them from becoming public domain.
(Similar to easement laws in real estate.)  If you let the public use
something
of yours without any attempt to protect it, after a while the public owns
it.
(In real estate, it means you have to post a no trespassing sign, put up a
fence, etc.)
It doesn't matter so much whether the public actually uses it, only that you
took reasonable action to prevent it.
Also, some companies make a profit off of licensing their names.  UCLA makes

millions per year from all over the globe.  Rolls Royce as always taken very
firm
legal measures to protect it's name.  Now that VW owns them...?
