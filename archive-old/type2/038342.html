Subject: Re: Replacing window rain guard

Tim:
    I just did that yesterday on my 69. It is pretty easy. I ordered the
entire scraper/crome trim piece from Ron _at_ Bus Depot. All you need to do is
roll down your window,  remove the panel from inside the front door remove
the two bolts that hold the glass from the apparatus that raises and lowers
the window and let the glass rest on the bottom of the interior of the door.
There are five clips that hold the scraper/crome to the door which need to
be pried off before you pull the whole piece out. Installation is easy
(simply pop it in where the old one came out) just be careful as the crome
trim is very light and will bend under it's own weight.

Hope this helps,

Subject: Replacing window rain guard


&gt; Hello all:
&gt;
&gt; I am pursuing replacing the rubber window scrapers on the driver and
&gt; passenger doors of my 72 bus. These are the rubber strips that press up
&gt; against the window, preventing the rain from seeping into the inside of
the
&gt; door, where it then can enter the vehicle. Mine no longer press firmly
&gt; against the window ... so when it rains, water comes into the car. And it
&gt; rains a lot in the Seattle area.
&gt;
&gt; Has anybody out there done this procedure? I'm trying to figure out how
much
&gt; of everything I have to take apart to put the new rubber in. Looks like
the
&gt; windows might have to come out, but I don't know about the other molding
&gt; pieces, the wing window, etc.
&gt;
&gt; Any help would be greatly appreciated.
