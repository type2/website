I am I am I am Superman... oh, sorry, that's the jingle from the
IBM/Lotus ad... gotta quit watchin' so much tee vee ;-)

I'm an aeronautical engineer... I do research and development on
helicopter flight control systems.

My Bus has been my only four-wheeled vehicle for over a year now, since
my Nissan got creamed by a full-sized sport utility.  I first acquired
my Bus when I was a starving graduate student, and nursed it from a $400
shell with no engine into the daily-driver that it is today.  Once in a
while I'm tempted to buy a car, but then the thought of that monthly
payment and exorbitant insurance fee snaps me back to reality... I love
my Bus!

As an engineer, I appreciate and value the thought and elegance that
went into the creation of the Volkswagen.  Those are also the elements
that made the VW so accessible to non-engineers.

I've put some stories and pictures on the web... anyone who feels like
looking at 'em, they can be found at http://www.instability_dot_com/vw .
