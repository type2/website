Subject: Re: [T2] knock, knock

&gt; No HCBF for me. While heading up the mountain on US 421 the
&gt; unsettling sound of a rod beating itself to death brought the trip to
&gt; an abrupt halt. Thanks to Roy, Chad, John, Jim Henry, H. Steve Dolan,
&gt; Nikki Elko and the Canadians for pulling over to check up on me and
&gt; keep me company until the roll-back arrived. I was really kinda of
&gt; funny. At one point there were seven buses parked on the side of a
&gt; mountain in front of a little house having pleasant conversation. I
&gt; wonder what the poeple in the house were thinking?

Chris,
Bummer. Is this the engine from the '69?
Just wondering about what sort of bad sound it was exactly.
