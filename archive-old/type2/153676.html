Subject: Panel sighting, at drive in movie

Was watching &quot;Speedvision&quot; Drive in theatre recently, and in the preamble to
each movie segment, there was a blue and silver or blue and white (bad color
on set) panel van with roof rack and it looked to be a &quot;splitty&quot;, that was,
(&quot;if it's rocking, don't come knocking&quot;) drive in movie thing.  Looked nice
and clean.
