Subject: Attitudes

.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;....Sorry, you didn't follow my directions in the text. I'll make it
easier for
you. And please don't accuse me of something untrue because you didn't read
properly.....&gt;&gt;&gt;


I am reading posts from this list as well as a club list, and folks I am
begging you, please take a deep breath.

Feels like the attitudes are getting edgy.

Just my $.02
