&gt; Hi all -
&gt; 
&gt; Well, the GEX rebuild trial run (FL to CO) was a success (whew!).  Arrived 
&gt; back in beautiful Colorado yesterday (8/31),
&gt; Only glitch during the trip came 
&gt; late:  about 2 miles past Byers, CO, my exhaust came off the left heat 
&gt; exchanger.  No, I don't know where the bolts went.  Judging from the greatly 
&gt; altered appearance of what was a new exhaust when I first left Florida (now 
&gt; very ashy/rusty looking - is this due to the higher than normal heat of an 
&gt; enging break in?),

No, all exhausts do that.  the paint is only there to keep it from rusting
until installed.

&gt; I can only guess that heat &amp; stress contributed to the 
&gt; bolts breaking off.  Additionally, the gaskets that came w/the exhaust seem 
&gt; to have mostly disintegrated.  Dunno.  Will swap out w/the metal covered 
&gt; gaskets that came w/the rebuild.  Will also get thicker bolts.

Often exhaust kits came with _really_ substandard hardware.  I've no idea
why except that they can get away with it.

&gt; My only other problem was a small amount of exhaust issuing forth from my 
&gt; heater vents during the whole of the trip.

This is a very bad thing.  Either you are sucking exhaust back into the
engine bay or you have a leak inside a heat exchanger.

&gt; 
&gt; Anyhow, does anyone have an idea of where I might begin to track down where 
&gt; exhaust is entering the heating ducts?  I'd used some fiberglass patch stuff 
&gt; to plug small openings on both heat exchangers, along their seams, where 
&gt; they connect to the duct going to the heat flaps.

Fiberglass probably isn't heat-resistant enough for this application, and
the hot resin can produce nasty smells and a possible fire.
