Subject: Re: Wiring to the Rear of the Bus

From: tjaspers_at_ameripath_dot_com

&gt;how some of you guys have handled adding additional wiring to the rear of
&gt;the Bus. For example, my CHT wiring.. do you unravel the wire loom and
&gt;rebundle it? Or did you find somewhere else to tuck the wire away?

I have run wires to CHT, oil pressure, and oil temp gauges by generally running them parallel to existing wiring harness but not bundled with the loom - 
maybe zip-tied to it here and there.  Most places the loom passes through cross members and such, there's plenty of room to slip another wire or two 
through the opening next to it.  If that doesn't work, I just try to follow the same general path, but I've also had no problems scouting my own trail, 
passing the wire above crossmembers, conduits, etc.  Using zip-ties as needed to secure it.  Due to the open framework underneath a bus it's a lot 
easier (IMO) to run wires astern than it is on a Beetle or Ghia.
