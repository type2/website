Subject: Re: [T2] Firing Order

&gt; It is true that the distributor can only go in one way,  but the orientation
&gt; of the rotor once the distributor is seated is entirely depending on the
&gt; orientation of your distributor drive gear in the case. That means that you
&gt; can have the distributor seated and notch pointed in any direction, then you
&gt; can find TDC for #1, spin the distributor so the notch lines up with the
&gt; rotor, and proceed to set the valves, and achieve a well-tuned engine that
&gt; runs great, and in most cases you'll be able to time it properly. But when
&gt; the next person goes in to try and tune it up they will be confused. 

What Chris says is also true, but I'd like to apply a version to Occam's 
Razor to this problem. [1]  It is possible for a distributor drive gear to 
be oriented incorrectly, but it is more likely that there is another 
problem.  For example, different distributor models have different rotor 
orientations.  To wit:  for a stock vacuum adv. dizzy on a '71 bus, at TDC 
and when #1 is firing, the rotor points roughly to the (let's see if 
i can visualize this correctly) front, right corner of the bus (FIF), 
whereas if you were to pop a 009 in without turning the engine at all, the 
rotor would point to the rear, right corner of the bus.  

I guess all I'm trying to say is:  Make sure you have everything else set 
up properly: your wires in the correct places and your valves adj. 
properly, etc. before you go suspecting and/or pulling your dizzy drive 
gear.  The dizzy drive gear is seldom the problem and a real PITA to pull 
and replace &quot;just right&quot; without cutting up your worm gears at all.  More 
often than not, this will be a &quot;wires on wrong&quot;, &quot;engine not timed close 
enough&quot;, or &quot;valves not adjusted properly&quot; issue.
