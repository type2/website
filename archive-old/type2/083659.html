&gt; Just got my bus back he said he had to grind the new alternator to make it fit around the cab.
&gt; Is this some that needs to be done when putting in 71?
&gt;
&gt; I was not very happy to a hole in the side of that new alternator when pick the bus up.  My goal is to have  that bus for a long time.

&gt; Thank you,
