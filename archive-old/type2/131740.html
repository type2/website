Subject: Re: [T2] Type 4 motor, engine stand question...

&gt;From: Mark Hineline running on the stand gave enough running time to 
&gt;retorque the heads, that might be worth the effort.


Hey that is what I am looking to to do and a very good point. Also in 
thinking of modifying the stand I have. After the mounting of it, I can add 
support arms from the foward wheels at the cross member. They would attach 
to the crossmember and then to the ends of the mutache bar. Honestly I fell 
that should be plenty, but never having tried it I can't guarantee it, yet.
