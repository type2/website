Hi Erling,

I just finished installing two of those gauges on my 79 Westy, and it was 
pretty straightforward.

At the bottom of the gauges, there are three contacts, as follows:

+ - Switched positive lead
- or GND - Ground,
preferably a &quot;quiet ground&quot; with no other electrical connections
S - Signal from sender

At the top of the gauges is the light, which can be hooked to the instrument 
lights or a separate switch.

Good luck,
Jason
