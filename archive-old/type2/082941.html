Any number of reasons.  First of all - he is most likely talking about ha=

Any mechanic that can play 'connect the dots' should not make this simple=

Busses are slow.  Its only supposed to be able to do around 80mph- and th=

at about 5grand. Late busses ran a 5700rpm rev limiter rotor originally.
Beetle people will cringe when you talk about the bus engine spending mos=

Your bus could be slower than it is supposed to because of maybe:
Presence of 009 distrubutor.
Improper carb adjustment/FI component failure.
Worn cam/lifters/ improperly adjusted valves
Overall engine fatigue - pistons/cylinders/low compression
Running hot due to :
   vaccum leaks (many sources -mainly the booster line and intake seals)
   improper timing
   missing cooling tin pieces
   Missing heating system pieces
   Leaky engine compartment (seals, battery tray)
   Improper carb adjustment/FI component failure

Brake problem? Maybe a front caliper is grabbing?
Is your bus overloaded? Unlikely but possible.

Losta stuff, man.
You can spend thousands of dollars trying to make a bus go fast.
The best thing to do is get everything about the engine the way it is sup=
posed
to be and then get used to it being slow and try not to push it too hard.=
