&gt; Okay Problem #2 of the day.
&gt; 
&gt; Where would I find the VW part # on a Cam Shaft? Are the Gears numbered the
&gt; same? I wouldn't believe that they are. Mine says 021 109 111C VW 10H?

My old one didn't have a number on apart from the gear.  I assume that as
the gears are non-removable VW just treated it as a single part.
