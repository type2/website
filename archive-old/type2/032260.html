Subject: low oil pressure at idle
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SOL.4.02A.9907011755430.21252-100000_at_insci14.ucsd_dot_edu&gt;

I just went to the archives and looked at this subject.  There were mostly
questions, and few answers.  I think its all pretty straight forward,
increase idle, use thicker oil or check pump and relief valves for
sticking, and avoid over heating.  Any other suggestions or first hand
experiences?
---------------
I've just finished rebuilding my 77 2.0 L engine.  It has an automatic
transmission.  I drove it today for only the 6th time or so since the
rebuild.  I had just turned the idle speed adjustment screw in order to
bring the idle speed down towards normal (about 1100).  When I put it into
'D' the idle tends to drop, from the load placed on the engine and the
lack of function of whatever device is supposed to give more gas when in
'D'.  As it happens, the idle speed drops to the point that, while the
engine is still running, the oil light comes on!  Boy does that little
light scare me!  I just about died.  I checked the oil to see if low oil
levels contributed to the problem, they did not, the oil is right at the
correct level.  I found that I could switch into 'N' (neutral) and get the
oil light to go out, b/c of the increased idle speed, so I can drive it
for now, but it suggests to me that the oil pressure is too low, perhaps a
bad pump?  An obstruction of the oil strainer?  I don't know but I'd like
to.  Does anyone think it is normal for an engine to run slow enough for
that light to go on?  The engine has 30 wt oil in it, which was
recommenced by some book for break-in.
