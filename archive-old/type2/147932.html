Subject: Re: [T2] Timing revisited

 &gt;I've always wondered how the people who work in shops know how to time
the thousands of cars they &quot;tune-up&quot;. Is there a universal resource
for them to look at ?

Yes, there is. Or at least there used to be! Back in the 80's when my 
brother worked in a service station he had a thick book that listed all the 
basic tuning settings for all the car models they were likely to encounter. 
No doubt back then it would have had our VWs listed as they were still 
relatively new vehicles.

Cheers,

Martin.
