Subject: RE: [T2] Hydraulic lifters - mistake to r...

From: Access Systems

much much more important than what kind of lifters that were used.  in
your 77 I'm pretty sure solid lifters were stock

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yep but I never saw them. PO got his hands on a genuine GEX :(. '74 Cali. 
Case I believe. Pulled the engine Sunday because there were no signs of 
flaps for the cooling tin. Confirmed it last night. Heads had a nice &quot;Couch 
Cushion Stuffing&quot; Insalation blocking the coolining fins too. Solid lifters 
though. Good thing it could have burst into flames........watchout!

Later,

Soon to have &quot;Crygenically Treated Hydraulic Lifters&quot;
