You might have something there.  The 195-75s that I have to measure
are Uniroyals, others may be narrower.

After surveying data available at various sites on the 'net, as well
as my own measurements, I think that the data I presented on rolling
circumference of the 195-75s being 4% smaller is correct.  Your engine
will turn faster at any given speed.  Seeing as how buses originally
came with bias tires that were even larger in rolling radius than the
185R14 that became standard later on, I think that 4% is significant.

Data I've collected also verifies that the 195-75s have less load
capacity for any given load range than the 185s.  You need to buy
195-75s in load range D to support the load rating required by a bus. 
I think that this has to do with the geometry of the tire.  Short,
squarish tires rely on the tire structure more to maintain tire shape
than the taller, rounder tires.  The 195-75 Uniroyals are actually
smaller than a 185 in every dimension except tread width.  Great tires
for fitting tire chains, which is what mine are doing for me now!
