Subject: Re: Volksworld Magazine and my Baja site

hey steve, just give them a call.  i have a subscription and am here in the
u.s.  they'll probably send you any back issues (or current) that you need.

cheers on the recognition in such a top-notch mag.  it blows away the crap
mags coming out of california.

O
&gt;  
&gt;  This is for the guys in the UK.  I've heard on the grapevine we call the
&gt;  internet that my Baja Bus site was listed in the March 2000 issue of
&gt;  Volksworld, If anyone has it (I can't get it here in Australia) could
they
&gt;  Pmail me and let me know the details so I can decide if it's worth the
&gt;  trouble of geting someone from the UK to mail me the mag or not.  Errrrm,
&gt;  and if it is worth it anyone one prepared to send it on over, I'll
organise
&gt;  some way to cover all the costs of course.
&gt;  
&gt;  Cheers
