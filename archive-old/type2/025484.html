Hi Volks,

I have a 2016cc engine all set and ready to go, BUT I am leaving for Italy
next Thursday and the engine will go in storage. Should I break the engine
in before I leave or should I let it wait a year before firing it for the
first time? The cam has not been hardened yet.

How would one go about pickling a new engine for that period of time. My
room-mate suggested that I remove the rockers to take off the spring
pressure. Should I put the vehicle up on jack stands? (Swing axle).
The vehicle is a 63 dunebuggy. It is going in a storage bin.

Same goes for my 68 camper, should I fog the cylinders. I have some fog left
over from my boat. Should I leave the gas tanks dry or should I put like a
half tank in and add Stabil.

I am going to miss this LIST!

Thank you all in advance.
