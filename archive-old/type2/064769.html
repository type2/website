Subject: 'nother Exhaust Removal Question

   HAPPY HOOSIER HOWDY!!   

     Does one have to remove the muffler(s) &amp; exhaust pipes to get to the heat exchangers &amp; to check to see if the heater controls work?  I think I need to check this out, as I froze my *whatever*  off last winter &amp; I don't think I'm going to be able to afford a gas heater before this winter!

                                                                                        Thanx,

                                                                                         Dave Newport
