I just got my new '77 and '78 Busses the other day.  After a close
inspection of both, I've decided to dump the plan of swapping motors for
the time being, and just tune up the runner.  The rust on both of them is
more than I am willing to tackle at the beginning of winter.  Which brings
me to a mess-o questions for those in the know.  The engine was billed as a
2.0l.  It's got dual Solex 32-34 PSDII carbs, and a vacuum advance
distributor.  I've got the FI in a box but I'll leave installing that till
later, after I'm more aquatinted with the engine and have the wiring sorted
out.  The visible hoses look pretty fresh, but the butterfly valve on the
1-2 carb is closed when cold, and the 3-4 carb is open.  Which one is
correct?  It's sorely maltuned, and the oil filler cap is so tight that I
had to remove the funnel fitting just to get some oil in it.  I loaned out
my Muir book some time ago, and it might take a couple of days to get it
back.  But it's Sunday and I just gotta do something.  Suggestions for
archive search parameters?  I'm gonna poke around the engine and see if I
can find any obvious atrocities.  I've never owned a pancake and would
appreciate any help.  Thanks
Russell
