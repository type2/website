&gt; I've got a '79 bus and just threw the alt fan belt.  As I'm putting

&gt; where to get some leverage.  I looked in Bentley and it just says  
&gt; to set
&gt; tension so there is 5/8&quot; movement.  I'm having trouble moving the  
&gt; alt to get
&gt; it that tight.  What am I missing?

To loosen the belt you can squeeze it together with two hands.

To tighten, stick a screw driver in the gap above the t-slot nut and  
bolt and lever down on it.  It doesn't have to more far...
