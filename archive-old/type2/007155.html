Subject: Ham Radio contact with Bob Perring

List,

Was in contact with Bob Perring this morning...he is driving Casper, his '70 
Westy around the midwest.  He was in Indiana at the time, will be camping 
somewhere there tonight. In a couple of days will be in St. Louis to pick up 
Mary Beth, his wife and they will continue to travel in Casper.  Bus is 
running fine, getting around 22 mpg...heck of milage for a stock 30 year old 
bus.

Anyway, for those with Ham radios, he is available to chat for the next 
several weeks, at 18.125 MHz.  For those that haven't met Bob, or seen his 
very sweet busses, Casper and NewBus...wow... those two '70 Westies are 
awesome..NewBus looks like it came off a showroom floor.
