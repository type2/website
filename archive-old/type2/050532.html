Subject: [T2] westfalia 2nd battery ??

Can anyone help me find the correct point of attachment for a mystery wire?

I have a 1979 westfalia deluxe with a second battery in the left hand side of 
the engine compartment.  The wiring appears to still be original, un-spliced 
and un-cobbled.

The positive cable for the second battery has a fairly heavy red wire 
attached to the battery terminal clamp that is about 22&quot; long.  This wire has 
a typical push on connector on its free end was not attached to anything  
when I bought the bus.

The most likely candidate for an appropriate attachment point seems to be a 
white, plastic relay mounted just to the left of the engine compartment door. 
 It appears to have a free terminal with some scratches on it.

Does this setup sound familiar to anyone?  
What might the relay be for?

Thanks,
