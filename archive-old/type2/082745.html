Subject: Re: re:74 1/2 bus probs

To my knowledge all 74's came with a type4 1800 w/dual
carbs. Your FI 2.0 was not original equipment (U.S.A).
74 1/2? 

&lt;snip&gt;
From: Ramazotti &lt;ramazotti_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;
I am haveing a serious problem.I have a 74 1/2 VW Van
that has been completely and loveingly restored for
my Wife and daughter to drive around in. The original
FI2.0l motor was blown and I have replaced it with a
1978 FI2.0l engine. After much hardship ........
&lt;/snip&gt;
