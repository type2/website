Hello listees,
   I am selling a '71 Westy here in good 'ol Northern California (Sacramento
Area), and I was hoping a Type Two lover out there would want her.  She's
white and nearly rustless(excluding the driver's side floor).  She has all
original accoutrements, including the original tranny and interior.  I have
a New ATE M/Cyl for her, and new tires, as well as extra wheels, extra
doors, etc.  No, there isn't any major  bodywork required, just dings and
dents(all minor).  She comes with cots, canvas, and rear tent/screen.  The
engine isn't running, but I'm sure it will with a little TLC, since it
turns-over fine, and with good compression.  I also did a little electrical
work to clean-up the PO's mistakes. :^)  If you need it to be running, I
will do the work, but it will cost more.   I have a '70 that needs all my
time this summer, so I have to give my Westy away... :^(  All reasonable
offers will be considered!  Please give her a good home.  Thank You List!
