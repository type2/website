Subject: Wanted: Engine for a 1972 VW Camper

I don't think it's a Westy, I just bought it on Wednesday, and I'm still 
kinda new to the whole scene.  But if anyone in Southern Maryland (or 
anywhere, I guess) knows where I can get a decent engine for it, please tell 
me.  The current one is blown and I'm anxious to get m'bus on the road :) 
Again, 1972 Camper.

Thanks!
Steff, proud owner of a cool bus
