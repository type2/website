Hey gang
i have my spare mounted on the front of my 74 westy(the mystery machine)with
the rim flipped so i can place a spare hubcap
on the original mounting notches this is done using barrel nuts to extend
the length of the studs on the mounting bracket
here in saskatoon (canada) there is a company called The Bolt Supply House
which my buddy works for (very handy when restoring
vehicles and and you have rusted or missing hardware)they have everything
imaginable. But i believe this is only a Canadian
company. I am sure there has to be somethin like this in the U.S.

Now for my question, with my tire mounted on the front like this it rubbs on
my paint and leaves a nasty ring on the nose. Has anyone
rigged a way of putting some kind of spacer in so the tire doesn't trap dirt
etc...

thanks

Christopher sez:

&gt; I saw a bus some time ago with the spare tire mounted on the nose,
nothing
&gt; new. But he had it set up like a regular tire, with the little chrome
hubcap
&gt; in the center. The rim was painted nicely the color of the bus as the
rest
&gt; had been.
&gt; My spare tire I don't think ever could hold the cap because of its
&gt; shape/difference from the stock rims, but even if I had a extra stock
&gt; rim/tire combo instead would those bolts coming from the tire mount stick
&gt; out so far you couldn't get the centercap on, or if that going to be the
&gt; easy solution - simply pick up a stock rim from a junk yard and use that
for
&gt; my spare after I paint it to match my current rims?
&gt;
&gt; Im guessing its more involved than this, but if anyone knows better???
that
&gt; would make my day.


My bus came with a barrel nut (a long nut, about 1.5 inches, allows another
bolt to be screwed into it) on the spare tire mount that was holding the
spare on, as well as 2 lug nuts. I have been meaning to figure out what
thread is on the other end of the barrel nut as it isn't the stock lug bolt
thread, since I want to do the same as you. I need 2 more to do a decent
job of mounting the tire, but this is low priority. If you knew the thread
and pitch of the lug bolt you should be able to find these barrel nuts
somewhere, I have seen people reference online fastener companies as
sources of stainless hardware, I'm sure they could get barrel nuts as well.
