Well, as often as I have done this :-),  I submit that not only is it
possible, it's *easier* with the engine in the car!  The two hardest parts
of the job, removing the alternator hinge bolt and the oil filler tube,
are much easier with the engine a foot or two off the ground!  They still
ain't any fun, but access is better.  A couple other things not to forget:
(a) you only need to take off the three outer bolts on the fan, not the
center bolt; (b) remember the bolts on the driver's side that hold up
the muffler and the oil cooler; (c) you need to remove the oil fill tube
where it joins the block, not remove the plastic fill tube from the metal 
fill tube (I got confused on this, Bentley isn't exactly clear).

Once the fan shroud is off, if you are replacing the rear motor mounts,
remove the nuts from the bottom of the mounts, support the engine, remove
the bar, then remove the nuts from the top of the mounts.  The top studs
angle in and you cannot push them out of the way enough while they are on
the bearer bar (ask me how I know :-)
