Subject: NO ADVANCE

So im trying to get my new bug tuned up nice and i went outside today and 
was in the process of timing it and when pressed on the gas with the timing 
light on and i didnt get any advance. It stayed at 10 degrees, Then i kept 
going and the light just stoped. The dwell was ok. i think like 43. the 
plugs gapped. valves adjusted. so the mark didnt move and then it just cut 
out! whats with that? Thanks, oh yeah. Im using a bosh 009 with a single 
solex.

joey
