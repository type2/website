Subject: Clutch OK now how bout that shift coupling?
Message-ID: &lt;37280B7B.EF3E7190_at_home_dot_com&gt;

Thanks for the advice George! I put in a diaphram pressure plate and new

clutch disk as well as install
the throwout fork repair kit(spring,bushing seals etc..). My clutch
feels
better than it's has ever felt in
3 yrs of owning my bus. No noise and smooth shiftin' . This weekend I'm
going to install a new
urethane shift coupling. Any one got tips or tricks for that project?
