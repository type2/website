Subject: Re: VDO Gauge &quot;Spin-Lok&quot; System

My solution was to cut some length off the legs of the mounting brackets 
when I earlier mounted voltmeter and oil temp gauges in this area. For 
the spin-lok gauge I'm having trouble with, I also have put some tape 
around the oil pressure gauge to hold it in place.

&gt;the thickness of the dash padding between radio and ashtray also
&gt;precludes the use of the usual type of bracket. I obtained a snug fit
&gt;just by winding two layers of electrical tape around the gauge body.
