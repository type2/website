Subject: BN2 Gas Heaters

Following along the recent thread on gas heaters, I picked up a pair
of BN2's at the Toronto VW show and I've got a couple questions.

1.  Are the BN2's any good?  What years did they come in?

2.  Does anyone have any documentation on these?  Guides, diagrams, etc.

I was hoping to try getting one of these working, but if the BN2 isn't any good,
I'll chuck them...I'd only be out 10 bucks (cdn).

There was a guy there selling 80 gas heaters (misc types) but he sold them
all to a guy that restores them.

Thanks,
