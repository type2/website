Subject: update on future 72-74 dual carb page

greetings,
this is to enlist more help on the design and collecting of
information to put together a page dedicated to 72-74 stock solex dual
carbs.  i have a fair sized list of folks who are contributing 
1-photos of unmolested carb set-ups
2-web page design help
3-collecting of any/all related vw info on 72-74 solex carbs.

it seems that #1, 3 are the most important so far.  old micro fiche,
vw bulletins, anything that relates to these dual carbed busses.  i do
not want a page that is lacking in information,  or CLEAR,DETAILED
photos of these carbs/linkages/and related parts.  

so basically i still need info!!!!!  

and to save time...send pics to my via email (address above) OR mail:

GOOD photos are a must!!  if you dont take good clear pics (and you
have a great stock dual carbed bus that would be perfect to
photograph...) find a friend who will help with the pics.  

enough already.....i think you all get the point...

zzz &lt;~~~~~~still needing vw info/pics on stock dual carbs.
