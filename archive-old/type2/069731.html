I've got the dimensions for the seal (not handy at the moment,
though), just need to find a shop that sells such things.  The
suggestion has been to check out places that do bearings, which is
also where to pick up a taper bearing if the current one has problems.
I'm guessing that that's more of a wear item than the worm gear, just
due to relative sizes and all.  The really hard to get part is the
worm gear, as it's unique to VW (part of the steering column).

It's good to know that the seal is the same size as something that's
common in the US.

Thanks.
