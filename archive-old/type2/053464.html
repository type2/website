Subject: Fw: Saggy Rear End - any other sites available?

&gt;
I have to confess, I've got a mechanical mental block on this one.  My saggy
old bus looks like it's squatting to pee all the time, but I don't want to
take rotating the rear bars on because I'm afraid it will drag on and I'll
lose precious summer hours.  Even the garage I trust most in these parts
won't do it (VW specialists no less) because they say parts break, etc.

Are there any sites out there with better illustrations than the ones above
(for the rear)?  We drafting types tend to be overly picture oriented.

Thanks.
