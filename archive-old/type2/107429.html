Subject: STRANGE OCCURANCE

Thanks for everyones responses. I just went out and looked at the wires
attached
to the starter and they are looking pretty corroded and old.
The last 72 van I had was the same , and one day it was running good
and then it wouldn't start , I jiggled the wires aroung abit to see if
anything was
loose and the darn wire was so corroded it just snapped off.
I ended up having to clean all the wires with a wire brush and replacing all
the connections.
Then I had to replace the starter. luckily I removed the starter off the old
van so I have a spare.
So it looks like this same thing is happening all over again. aaaaagggg

Darren
