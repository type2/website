Subject: Re: [T2] engine miss

check fuel pressure also as well as the double relay.  I have seen fuel 
pump(part of the double relay) relays and fuel pumps cause similar 
problems. and the fuel filter and air cleaner.  plugged fuel filters and 
air cleaners can make it look like a problem elswhere in the system.  At 
the same time checking the air cleaner check all the hoses going to the 
AFC for a vacuum leak.  Thats the challenge of AFC injection systems.  
They are a loop.

&gt; I have a reoccurring problem with a 79 bus, engine stock with FI.
&gt; Occasionally it is hard to start, and after coaxing it to start, it 
&gt; will only
&gt; give me 6 to 8 seconds of power, then the bus coasts for 7 to 8 
&gt; seconds. If
&gt; my foot remains on the accelerator while coasting, then the bus will
&gt; typically lurch back into power for another 7 to 8 sec.
&gt; I'm going to try and test the FI system with a multimeter this weekend. 
&gt; But
&gt; does this sound more like a vacuum leak problem?
&gt;
&gt; Any advice is welcome, thanks
