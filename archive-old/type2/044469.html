&gt; Hey Y'all,
&gt;   Sometimes on the list we seen to point out the negitive things that people

&gt; service that was provided to me.
&gt;   Joe Cali, owner of Next Generation, has written a book titled &quot;the Type IV
&gt; Upright Convertion Manual&quot; I shows how to modify a type 4 motor to fit into
&gt; a Bug, Ghia, or pre 71 Bus.[...]

Scott,
welcome to the club.  Joe's book got me started and I never regretted converting
the Type IV motor into an upright.
My '60 double cab is more fun to drive than should be allowed and I am able to
survive with regular driving on SoCal Freeways.

Scott
