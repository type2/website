Subject: I apologize...

...for those digests that showed up several times today. They looked like
propogated bounces, but they weren't--they were digests a month old. I
still have no idea whythef*ck they were being posted, but any further ones
will be intercepted and beaten to death.

*That*ll teach me to go to work and leave things unattended...
