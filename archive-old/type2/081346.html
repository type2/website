&gt; Atta boy Rob! In furtherance, using someone else's address illegitimately,
&gt; trespassing on anothers property by camping in a quiet industrial area
w/out
&gt; permission (including advice on how to avoid detection), and using an area
&gt; business' bathroom for other than it's intended purpose (namely so that
paying
&gt; customer's have a toilet and sink available when patronizing) and
otherwise
&gt; bumming off others can all be appropriately described as 'another thing'.
Is
&gt; spreading such baloney the highest and best use of the list? Not in my
&gt; estimation.

&gt; &gt; come on down, I'm in Charlotte, but don't ask if you can live here for

&gt; &gt; I know there isn't much bus content here and we should kill this thread,
but
&gt; &gt; I just hate to see the promotion of:
&gt; &gt; just because I own a bus too I am going to give you something for free,
&gt; &gt; especially a place to live.

&gt; &gt; Matty,  I got kicked out of my house when I was 17, but I worked every
day
&gt; &gt; and paid my bills sharing with a roommate. I now own my own house and I
am
&gt; &gt; not rich, but I am responsible.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Touring the country as a reward to yourself is one thing, bumming off
your
&gt; &gt; friends is another.

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; If your job is sedentary and it's not too hot, you can shower every
other
&gt; &gt; &gt; day, usually at a friend's house.  Laundry facilities can be had as
well,
&gt; &gt; &gt; especially if you're hanging out with friends where the laundry is
free.
