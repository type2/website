&gt;Bosch defects include misfires (bad internally) 

Not once in my experience with many thousands.

and bad threads (out of the

Not once.

which promptly stripped a friend of mines plug hole on a brand new
&gt;$1200 racing HEAD (not plural).

Did he not know that plugs that can't be turned to the seat with finger
strength shouldn't be forced in with a wrench????????????? 

&gt;
&gt;We only sell NGK, they are around $.50more per unit than Bosch, which is
&gt;chump change IMO.

The only prob I have ever seen with a Bosch plug was a batch of platinums
that had electrodes with a tendency to creap. It was an anomaly. Must agree
that half a buck is chump change. At $2.00 a pop, Bosch is still the right
plug for the great majority of the European engines, more especially air
cooled German motors.
