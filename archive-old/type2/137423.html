&gt; &gt; When I go to brake in 74 Westy, the brake pedal goes to the floor like it

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Is this indicative of the master cylinder leaking?
&gt;
&gt;Probably not.  There are two possible causes.  First, brake shoes that are
&gt;badly out of adjustment can cause exactly this symptom.  Second, air in
&gt;the system can cause this symptom as well.

It's the MC.

Air &amp; you get a mushy pedal &amp; can pump the brakes up, with brakes needing 
adjusting you have excessive pedal travel before the brakes grab.

When the MC has an internal bypass the pedal simply goes all the way to the 
floor (a bad feeling) and the next pump they work normally. It's not 
unusual for them to work fine after that until the next time the pedal goes 
to the floor.
