Subject: Re: Opinions Wanted: Governor on Distributor?

I've got one in my 009 distributor. It's a 5400rpm rather than a 4500rpm 
which shouldn't be a problem considering my engine is balanced and has 
a counterweighted crank.

I like knowing that it's there, particularly as I don't yet have a tacho.
