Subject: Cannot Idle 
Message-Id: &lt;199906231755.LAA09989_at_digisys_dot_net&gt;

I have checked the archives some but had some trouble so please forgive me
if this is there and I missed it 

I recently replaced the Transmission in my 72 bus due to a broken case.
While the motor was out I purchased a set of rebuilt carbs and installed
them at the same time.  Other than the new carbs and a new set of plugs and
plug wires the motor went back in the bus just as it had come out.  I did
not mess with the timing etc. The bus ran great before the  transmission
replacement.

Now I can not get  the motor to idle at the recommended 900 RPM.  When I
first installed the carbs  it would not idle below about 1500 RPM it would
die if I tried to go any lower.  I read extensively from Muir and Chilton
and finally managed to get it lowered some but still runs at about 1000 RPM
and very rough.

I have a carb balancing tool and have a handle on how to use that (I think)
but  the first step in the process is to get it to idle close to 900 RPM
Also to time the motor requires about the same RPM 

To compound the problem I only get a few hours at a time to work on this. I
finally had it near  adjusted once then had to shut it down When I returned
the next day it would not even run at all suggesting the choke adjustment
is munged up.

One more thing to throw into the Mix.  As mentioned Weasr is a 72 bus,  the
carbs are off something later and did  include a  later style linkage, air
cleaner and manifolds.  I used these  parts from my 72 instead of the new
parts .  Could this cause any problems? 

I would appreciate any and all tips on what I should check etc.  Where
should I set the various screws on the card to start and what effect does
each have etc. I have as mentioned the Chiltons manual (no help) and  Muirs
excellent book but still cant seem to get this worked out  

I can pull the carbs if required and re-check everything  Please help I
would like to have  Weasr by this weekend.  

Thank you 
I always value the experience of the people in this list, since I am a full
time  computer professional but only a shade tree mechanic.
