&gt; Don't laugh, this actually does happen. Both my father in law and brother in
&gt; law have had their oil drain plugs stripped out by the &quot;lube technicians&quot; at
&gt; good ole wally world. I beliee my brother in law actually got them to pay for
&gt; reparing or replacing the oil pan.

They keep a stock of oversize self-threading oil drain plugs to fix their
mistakes, as well as introduce some thread debris into the oil system.
