&gt; Morning All,
&gt;        Question. Near where I work ( Mclean, Va.) there is, and I'm 
guessing 
&gt;  here, a '68 VW camper with the small pop up roof, like the '67 and earlier 
&gt;  Westfalias. Did some early '68's come with this small pop up roof before 
&gt; they 
&gt;  switched to the full length luggage rack/poptop? I've never seen a bay 
&gt; window 
&gt;  bus before with this style roof. The thing has been sitting in a driveway 
&gt; for 
&gt;  at least two years that I know of, and appears to be doing storage shed 
duty.

Hi Jeff

Certainly this is unusual, I've only seen one or two like this. Snaped a 
picture of one on a 74+  bus which can be seen at 
www.soft_dot_net_dot_uk/vwt2oc/pictures/vf97/p25.htm

I suspect that it was an option availlable from Westfalia and fitted onto 
other vehicles (non VWs) being converted into campers during the same era as 
it would just need the skirt to be cut differently to fit a different roof 
profile

Good luck
