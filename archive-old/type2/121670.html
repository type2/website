Subject: Wiring for '78 T4 FI

Thanks to the links provided of vacuum hose pics by a couple listers, the 
engine is MOSTLY ready for insertion, but the wiring remains a complete puzzle.  
Can someone please direct me to something similar for wiring, or maybe a 
narrative in the form of &quot;toe bone connected to the foot bone, foot bone connected 
to...&quot;

Two other hose questions:

The charcoal can has clear hose from bottom -- where do the other end attach?

And, the large shrouding covering cyls. 1 &amp; 2 has a metal nipple about two 
inches rear of #2 plug hole and protruding from the top right side.  What 
happens here?

Thanks.

Steve
