Subject: Re: [T2] bumper needed, parts for sale


In a message dated 9/8/01 7:17:25 PM, kurtrogers_99_at_yahoo_dot_com writes:

&lt;&lt; Does anybody on the list have or know of a bumper for
sale for a 1972 westfalia?  I have the bumper guards
and the mounting brackets.

Also, I have an 1800cc type 4 engine for sale.  I
pulled it because I lost compression in a couple of
the cylinders.  I do have the dual solex carbs and all
linkage, although they could use new bushings.  I was
planning on keeping it around for a possible rebuild
but I just don't have the space.

thanks
