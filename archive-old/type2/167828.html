Subject: Re: [T2] Blaupunkt radio polarity

Richard Atwell's found a Blaupunkt  Mannheim L AM/FM-modo radio, 
can't tell what's + &amp; -, and asks:
&gt;
&gt;Is there a safe way to test this radio?

	Expert answers to T2 list please  -  not solely to Richard 
privately  -  as, eerily, I'm in exactly the same position.
