&gt; you can try ALL- Bug for a Bus tow bar--
&gt; 602-997-7345
&gt; allbugphx_at_aol_dot_com
&gt; 9223 N. 12th ave Phoenix, az., 85021

I have one from them and from their own words it will not work on a 71 - up
bus because part of the brakes interfere.

Peace brothers and Sisters,

If you are going to walk on thin ice,
