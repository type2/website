Subject: OEM style T2 F. Door Panels are in!

Wolfsburg West just called me to confirm that I still wanted their long
awaited OEM style grey cardboard door and kick panels and headliner pieces.
They have arrived and are shipping to me today!

Kicks: 
$28.00 per pr.
No Barns ~ Sorry =(
Early&gt; mid'55-early'63 (specify year/ fuse holder will be cut to spec.)
mid'63-early'64
mid'64-'67

Door panels:
$52.00 (No pockets and not punched for the snaps. Not drilled for the screws)
All years.
Crew rear pieces &lt;made to order at this time&gt; $??.??

Headliners:
Kombi's $34.00
Single cab $38.00
Crew's (excepting Binz) $38.00 + $52.00 &lt;includes cardboard seam strip&gt;

No info given for cargo doors, Kombi &quot;long panels,&quot; or rear hatches due to
the non OEM application of the grey cardboard on these areas.

NEATO and SOTO discounts given &lt;have member number handy&gt;

**VanBondo has seen a sample of the material used and it looks pretty good
and has a texture that approximates OEM with the exception of the plastic
coated door panels that I know were in the '67's for sure and possibly the
'65 and '66's. The grey is close to &quot;correct&quot; &lt;might be right on the mark as
far as I know&gt; and the texture looks great but the sample I got looked like
the correct pattern but with a very slight over marking that looks like a
metal screen mesh was pressed into it as well. Outside of buying the right
kind of cardboard, razors, paint, geting the edges clean (router or
whatever) add to that the labor, your time, and potential for &quot;goof-ups.&quot; I
will step up gladly on this one. Figure your total costs and then compare
the prices posted above...

Tell 'em Rusty VanBondo told you about them on the &quot;internet.&quot;
