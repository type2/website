Subject: '71 Westy Assistance Request-Oregon 101N

Hello!

This is a request for assistance on behalf of someone I met at a rest stop in
their '71 Westy.  They are having electrical problems (no headlights), and are
only driving in the daytime.

The rest stop I met them at is approx. 20 minutes north of Laytonville, CA.
They're heading to Idaho via Seattle, but will remain on 101 Northbound at
least through Oregon.  I do not know what their rate of travel is.

Problem details:  He recently replaced turn signal/headlight dimmer switch.
He was driving at night, and switched to high -beams, and then when he
switched back to low-beams, the headlights went out entirely.  Apparently he
got them to work intermittently, but at this point he has no lights. (Running
lights do function)

I believe that he has a funky switch, or possibly that he fried his relay when
messing with the new switch...most likely some crud in the switch...

If someone could call him on his cell phone (leave message if no answer), it
would be great!

Here's their info:

Chris and Donna (plus one little teeny person)
(435) 840-1228

No need to reply to this message unless you want to tell me you got it, and if
you helped them out, I'd like to know!

Thank You!
