Subject: Re: [T2] No wipers on 77 Westy?? Here is diagnostic breakdown
  so far.

Jamie, your diagnosis as ground was correct, well done! The wire looked 
good, but was not supplying ground from the body spade to the terminal 
block. A good beating with a big stick fixed it right up. :-) Wipers are 
once again wiping, my face is once again smiling.
Kindest regards,
Courtney

From: &quot;Jamie&quot; &lt;jrivers_at_globalserve_dot_net&gt;
 make sure the body of the wiper motor is grounded.

 hope that helps
Jamie Rivers
