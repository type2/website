&gt; 1) OEM German chrome ones, for $29.95 each. You won't find German mirrors

&gt; copies for almost the same price that rust out quickly and do not have the
&gt; same glass quality (there can be ripples in the reflection). I have to
&gt; import these myself, but the quality is so much better than the aftermarket
&gt; ones that it's worth the effort.

I have a set of these &quot;Hagus&quot; mirrors, and I can testify that the metal
doesn't rust and
the glass quality is excellent.  Unfortunately, the translucent plastic
around the glass does deteriorate in the sun over the years.  I finally
had to disassemble the mirror when the glass got loose and reinstall the
glass using other means to secure it.

Ron, if you have any influence over the manufacturer of these mirrors,
ask them to switch to a UV-resistant plastic.  These mirrors are sooooo
close to being perfect, but they really dropped the ball with the plastic!
