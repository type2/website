GOOD POINTS

&gt; With the advent of Carbon Monoxide alarms (I'm sure 12 volt models are
&gt; available at RV supplier - although I'll bet they're expensive), using one
&gt; if you are heating with gas would be a great idea.

I recently purchased a battery operated CO detector for my house from Home
Depot for about $20, about the size and appearance as the conventional
smoke detector, recently on TV there were some ads for combined smoke/CO
detectors from First Alert.  

so they are out there and inexpensive enough that anyone who uses any fuel
in their van should have one.  I am considering getting one just in case
of exhaust system leak
