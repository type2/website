Subject: Re: Westfalia Sticker--where?

&gt;Does anyone have/have access to/know where to get a Westfalia sticker for the
&gt;camper top?  I would like one, but I guess that goes without saying, seeing
&gt;as how I asked for info.  Wow... ok..  thanks

Scott Snider repro'd the small ones w/ the horse and the big letters for the
back too. I bought some and they're better than the originals. I don't know if
he's on the T2 list though. You can e-mail Jim DiGennaro at:    limbo_at_bcn_dot_net
and I'm sure he'll know, or I could try to dig up his phone#. He also advertised
this in LiMBO.
