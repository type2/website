&gt;How about putting something that says &quot;Type2_dot_com&quot; in the windshield? &gt;


I'm not sure there will be enough to use for both (but I'm also pretty sure
most people don't really want a stick on name tag on their shirt, either),
but if type2 listees at the Auburn Hills show want to take an extra sticker
and slap that on your windshield, I say go for it.

I suspect the feedback on the size and design will lead the way for next
year's identifiers.

See you there.
