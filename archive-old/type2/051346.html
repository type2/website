Subject: [T2] High Country Bus Festival Web Page Updated

First of all I would like to thank our gracious hosts at the Grandfather 
Mountain Campground for allowing us to return this year.  Due to unfortuante 
actions of a small few this event was almost canceled.  Please remember that 
we are guests in a public campground - this is not a dead show!  Quite hours 
after 10pm will be enforced- this means no drumming.  Also, a few &quot;fine&quot; 
people decided to have a mud war last year and, in no un-certain terms, 
trashed the camprgound's bathhouse.  OK enough of having to act like a 
parent - just please be respectful of our hosts or we may not be invited 
back.

That being said, GO BUS GO,  I can't wait for this year's festival!

The web page has been updated with all the info for this year's event.

The dates will be July 27, 28 and 29 - 2001.

Please email me if you have any questions.
-Buddah
