Subject: Re: [T2] Will a '72 tranny go into a late '74 Bus?

From: steelersbus

 I was reading on Ratwell's site about a tranny swap. I
 have a late '74 Bus. 215mm flywheel. The site says that I
 can install a '72 tranny into my late '74 Bus, but I would
 need to replace the flywheel with the 210mm.

 Is the flywheel the only thing that would need to match
 the '72 tranny? Or will I need to replace other parts as
 well? Also, if I do install this, when replacing the
 flywheel, does it need any adjustment? Or is it just
 tightened on?

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 210 and 215 flywheels are the same diameter.

Leave the 215 on your '74 engine!

The only time a flywheel problem comes up is when you use a 76-79 091 transaxle, then you have to use the 228
flywheel. [unless you swap the belhousing to the early one]
