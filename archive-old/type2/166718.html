Subject: Engine Paint

OK...  Thanks to the advice of many individuals on this list and the support
of my local VW club, I have started my first engine rebuild project.  I am
rebuilding the engine in my 1971 VW Westy and, in the process, going to
upgrade the engine to a 1776cc.  Since I am taking time to do all of this
work, I am also going to purchase some stainless fastners to replace items
like those stock engine tin screws (yes, I will be sure to use locktite given
the fact that it is stainless).

My question, this time, is related to engine paint.  Back when I was driving
the old 57 Chevy and its cousins, I would always take a little time to clean
everything up and give things a fresh coat of paint to make everything look
good and also help with finding oil leaks and such.  The &quot;dolling up&quot; doesn't
really last long but at least it is a point of pride.  On VW air cooled
engines, however, I need advice.  I have heard from many to be careful due to
the paint &quot;holding in the heat&quot;.  Also, some have even gone so far as to say,
&quot;stay away from .... color&quot;.  What is the advice of this group?  Is it safe to
paint the engine tin?  Can the jugs or block be painted?  Any advice would be
appreciated.

Thanks,

Michael
