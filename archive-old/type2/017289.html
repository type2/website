Subject: Bench test 1800 &amp; carb q's... kinda long.

IT'S ALIVE! Yippee, yahoo!

It's been a little over a year since my engine was complete &amp; coherent
enough to run... but IT'S BACK! Yes, I'm exited! I'm burning it in on
the bench (well, couple of sawhorses), tuning carbs, checking for leaks,
trying to bond with this fossil fuel fired monstrosity (I'm used to
those &quot;little&quot; Type1 engines).

A year putting this thing back together? 

Well, I haven't had much time to work on it, and I was making a serious
effort to do it right. Cleaned, sanded, repainted tin. Heater boxes got
a MIG touch-up on the few rust holes &amp; such. Heater boxes, muffler, &amp;
heat shield all got barbeque grill paint. Rebushed &amp; rebuilt carbs, New
heads (some of you may recall I didn't check CR when I originally
built... BAAAAD! This teardown/reassembly is my penance!).

So now it's sitting on sawhorses in the garage, fires up and runs...
I've never bench tested an engine before, but these things are enough
work to install that I figured it was worthwhile. In addition, all you
engine gurus out there (and on VintageBus) inspired me! So now I've run
it for about 4.5 hours total, another hour or so to tweak the carbs
(they're giving me fits!) and I'll retorque the heads before it goes in
the Bus.

Let's take a moment to talk about shop safety...

I used a plastic gas container for my fuel supply, and enough fuel line
to get it well away from the engine and battery. I don't want an engine
fire before I even get it on the road!

Did I mention I brought the fire extinguisher out too (a serious one,
not those car emergency things). 

I was going to run it outside, but we've had a storm system moving
through so I set up in the garage. Since I'm working in an enclosed
area, I bought an 8' length of flexible aluminum duct (like heavy-duty
dryer hookup stuff) at the home improvement store. Put one end over the
exhaust and the other out through the window where I removed a pane of
glass. Rolled up alum. foil as a gasket and then crushed the duct around
it to help seal up the exhaust pipe side. Also brought the CO detector
from the house and set it up near where I was working... never know when
you may have an exhaust leak.

What? You're still reading? Maybe you can help with a couple things:

I've got two push rod tubes leaking on #1, outboard end. I've cleaned
the bores &amp; replaced the seals, what now... something like the Hylomar
or grease as a sealant/lube? I would love suggestions. Nice thing about
bench testing and retorquing... these will be easy to get at while the
tin and rocker arms are off.

I'm also having trouble tuning the carbs (stock dual 34PDSIT's). I
looked through the archives, and found someone else with the same
problem, but didn't find an answer. Going through the Bentley procedure
for tuning the carbs, I'm told to:

1. Set throttle valve opening (did this for both normal &amp; fast idle as
per Bentley). Trimmed a couple narrow shims from an old feeler gauge to
measure the gap, BTW. 

2. Install &amp; synchronize. Connect tach &amp; CO tester (no CO tester, Damn!
Did the rest.)

3. Pull Rt. carb's throttle shaft, disconnect vac. retard from dizzy
(tried this both plugged &amp; unplugged).

4. Pull afterburner hoses... pump not installed. Disconnect central idle
cutoff solenoid (front of left carb).

5. Adjust vol. ctrl. screws on both carbs to 2.5 turns from bottom.

6. Start the engine &amp; set idle at 500 to 700 RPM- I'm confused, how do I
change the idle when they had me shut down the idle circuit? After this,
I'm supposed to adjust CO with vol. ctrl. screws. Tried using vol. ctrl.
screws to set the idle.

7. Here's the kicker that was in the archives- disconnect power from
idle cutoff solenoid on one carb (smaller, center solenoid) and note
decrease in RPM. The engine dies... I don't think they expect it to go
to 0RPM!

8. Repeat step 7 on other carb- engine still dies!

I set the timing to 10ATDC, as per Bentley for stock dizzy, but it
backfired through the carbs when applying throttle &amp; total advance was
only 24 deg. Reset so total advance is about 30 deg, runs nice... maybe
I need to rebuild this distributor, but I don't think that explains the
carb tuning problem (or the oil leak, for that matter :). 

Other than these two things, the engine is running good and looks good.
I scrounged all the bits that I was missing over the last year and a
half, so this thing is going to be about factory complete, minus
afterburner crap.

Hope the first part of this post is useful, and I appreciate any help
you can give on the troubles.
