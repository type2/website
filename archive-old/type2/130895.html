Subject: Pop-Top Camper in a Sunroof Body?

     A very wise VW guy told me that sunroof bus frames were sent to 
Westfalia for conversion into campers for several years.  I can't remember 
exactly what years or models were made using the sunroof body though.  Can 
any list members fill in the blanks?
     What can I say, it rained the other day so I am thinking of 
alternatives to the sunroof :-)  It's hard to find parts for them and 
expensive.  I'll give it a little more work, but I was thinking a pop-top 
might be nice.  If they were made to be installed into the sunroof hole it 
stands to reason that this would be a relatively easy conversion (compared 
to cutting a welding).
     Any people out there ever done this conversion?  How bad is it?  Anyone 
have a vehicle with this pop-top that I might be able to get?

Any info on this subject is appreciated.
