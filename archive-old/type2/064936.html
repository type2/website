I have a '64 Standard and we took the tranny out last week to put in a half
tonne one that is know good. 
When we got the tranny out we discovered it has a split case.  I don't have
a serial number but could anyone give me a time frame these where used? 
Anyone need one for your project?  It is reduction box to reduction box. 
It is extremely dry.  Out of a van that was parked in like '90 due to an
engine seizure. Located in Tacoma, WA.
