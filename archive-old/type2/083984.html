&gt;Do you lift the front of the bus?  The rear lifted that high means the
&gt;angle of the trans is quite different from that of the rolling engine,
&gt;so you could have interference with clutch release and the trans-shaft. 
&gt;If alone, it's hard to move the engine down as you insert!  On an early
&gt;bus, you can let down the trans so it's parallel to the ground when
&gt;pulling/inserting engine.
&gt;

I remove the tranny and engine together. It's real easy and you don't 
have to mess with lining up the trans and engine under the bus. With the 
amount of times I removed my engine this past year I have  gotten good 
at it.
