No, the triangle flanges were 75 to 78. The 'dreaded one-year' is 79 Calif and
79 Fed with the square ports.



&gt; Well, friends, I went to look at the 77 bus this evening. The owner didn't
&gt; lie, it IS nearly rust free. Some surface rust on the floors but nothing
&gt; serious. The body, including doglegs, wheel wells, and areas under the
&gt; windows appear to be free of rust. Even the battery trays look good. The
&gt; transmission is gone, baby, including the drive shafts, clutch cable, and
&gt; CVs. The interior is stripped except for the front seats, both of which are
&gt; in poor condition. It has been repainted a dark green but appears to have
&gt; been some funky shade of blue originally.
&gt;
&gt; The engine.....what can I say? It's sitting on the floor and appears to be
&gt; complete, including the FI stuff. Comes with a new clutch disc and pressure
&gt; plate. All the tin is intact and looks to be in good condition. The owner
&gt; says he has 'heard it run' but never driven it so I don't actually know much
&gt; about it. I saw one thng that bothered me....the dreaded TRIANGULAR EXHAUST
&gt; FLANGES!! Isn't this the one year only, NLA, never to be found again on this
&gt; planet exhaust system? On the bright side, doesn't another system
&gt; interchange with this one? ( I know there have been posts about this but I
&gt; never paid attention.)
&gt;
&gt; Last thing: does anyone have suggestions on where to get an appropriate
&gt; transmission for this model?
