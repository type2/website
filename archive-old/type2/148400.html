Subject: Re:[T2] Bay Window Rust &amp; Leaks

i think my seals are far fromold and brittle. i wonder to what extent  
oeveedub did research upon nos seals. for sure i would bungie from a  
bridge on each of mine. and they were cheaper. mine worked out to be  
half price, $25. plus, i'm not sure if i knew about oeveedub at the  
time of my purchase - at least a few years ago. it looks like they're  
selling an awesome product though, and i'd pay the premium price for  
an oeveedub seal after doing windshield rust repair, because screwing  
around with wcm is such a waste of time and throwing money away. but  
i wouldn't do it at the expense of a nos german gasket if the price  
is right and availability presents itself. - steve, hunting for nos  
deluxe [groove] windshield gaskets... or hoping to find oeveedub will  
make them.
