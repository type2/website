&lt;&lt; But I don't have my bus insured as a collector's/antique. I don't know if I

can afford it right now. Of course if it's in an accident and it gets totaled,

what the insurance company gets might not exactly be what I was driving! My

VDO guages, stereo, and likely the entire engine, will be waiting for a new

home. That's where all of my money is anyway.

Careful with collector's/antique insurance...Some only allow you to drive
a limited number of miles per year, and then only to &quot;events&quot;.
