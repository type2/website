Subject: [T2] AVP website?

hey volks,
i was just wandering around the web and decided to
check out AVP's site and it appears it is gone.  i was
there about a month ago and it was up and running.  
just wondering what was up since they are one of the
only decent engine parts people left.  id assume there
just reworking it, but wondered if anyone else had
heard anything, plus i hate having a dead link on my
site:)  the web address i had was:
http://www.sacbiz_dot_com/avp/
just curious
