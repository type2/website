Subject: Type2s and West Marine (was Suggestion for dash dial)

No one who has a Type2 camper conversion, of any kind, and who wants to 
maintain it well and perhaps add improvements, should be without a copy 
of the West Marine catalog. Get it by calling 1-800-262-8464.

No connection between them and me.
