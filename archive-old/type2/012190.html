Hi all -

I've posted new versions of my bus screen savers. 
They can be found at http://www.transporter_dot_org

There is one or two new Splitty and Bay pictures,
about 35 new Vanagon pictures (thanks to our Unca
Joel), and no new Eurovan pictures (c'mon EVers!).

Also, let me know if you have any issues downloading
these files.  I've been getting feedback that the
download speeds are excessively slow and/or
disconnecting users.  If this problem is really bad,
I'll consider moving the files to a site with better
bandwidth.  I would recommend using a download agent
like Go!Zilla (www.gozilla_dot_com) that recovers from
interrupted downloads.

Have fun!
