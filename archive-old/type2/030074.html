&gt; ply side walls. I took a deep breath, realized that in the FIRST 6 years of
&gt; owning this bus, I was offroad 2/3 the time; the last 6, maybe 4 times.

Heh.  I'm only onroad cause the tires dont like to be off:)

&gt; I hope that by the time I need new tires, there will be a tire like the
&gt; Yokohamas back in production.........

Indeed.  I have similar hopes for when it comes time for new shoes...to
bad moms vanagon is getting close to being worn out in the PO installed
Mich MXs...
