Subject: I-95 to I-85, Balt. to Atlanta, 5/11/00

If you see an orange '74 Westfalia with a red canoe on top heading south
on I-95, and then I-85 to Atlanta, tomorrow (5/11), that's me, and
things are apparently going well.  If you see me on the side of the
road, please stop. This is the first installment of my big move to
Atlanta, to be completed by the end of June.

Wish me luck.

Eric Forsman
