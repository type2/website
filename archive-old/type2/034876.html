Subject: Help: brakes

Volks:

After both my front brakes locked up on me last weekend, I spent the day
rebuilding calipers, replacing brake hoses, and installing a rebuilt
master cylinder.  I then emptied a quart of brake fluid bleeding the
brakes.  I must have bled each wheel 3 times.  The brakes are still
spongy!?!?!?!  I can push the pedal to the floor.  Pumping doesn't help.
I adjusted the brake pedal arm to servo rod as much as possible (can't
get all the slack out or I can't insert the pin in the brake arm.  It's
only ~1/2&quot; of pedal play).  I'm out of ideas.

Any help appreciated.  Supposed to be on my first bus campout tomorrow.

Thanks
