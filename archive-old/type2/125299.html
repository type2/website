Subject: RE: [T2] NEW Owners Manuals &amp; Dealer Tech Books - A Few More
  Added

&gt; I just bought a defunct VW dealer's remaining inventory of 
&gt; original Bus and Vanagon owners and factory tech manuals. 
&gt; This lot includes original Bus and Campmobile owners manuals, 
&gt; plus tech manuals that were meant for dealer distribution 
&gt; covering everything from fuel injection to gas heaters to 
&gt; wiring.  These have been out of print for a good 20 years. 
&gt; There are some real finds here.


Just a note that I found one or two more copies of some previously sold
out books at the bottom of the box, and have put them back on the web
page. Might be worth checking in case you missed out on them last week
when I first posted them. This is it now; when what's on the website is
gone there are no more.
