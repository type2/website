Subject: more on VW ads

last week while watching Speedvision (can't remember the
name of the show) i saw a replayed television ad.

the ad concentrated on a new feature of the beetle - a larger rear window.
IIRC, the ad went something to the tune of, &quot;the VW beetle is so close
to perfect that this is the only change needed.&quot;

then it showed comparison pics of a split-window beetle vs. the new, larger
rear window.  i think they said this was for '58 model year, but i really can't
remember.

it was really neat, though.

happy friday,
