Subject: Leaky steering box...

Hi all, 

I have a serious question.  I have a 71 bus and the steering box has 
seemed to developed a leak.. any fluid put into leaks out... I dont know 
at what rate or how fast yet... but was wondering is there anyway to fix 
this. It seems to be leaking from the bottom of the steering box where 
the 4 bolts are.
 (mind you it has been getting worse of the past four years that i 
have had the bus.)  The steering box came from a junk yard and was in like 
new condition, the box that was on the bus had way too much play in it.
If ya held yer hand on the top of the wheel you could turn the wheel 
about half way before the wheels even started to turn. My dad drove it 
like this for a year before findally giving the bus to me...

anyways ....
