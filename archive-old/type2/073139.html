Message-Id: &lt;v03110706b35465f6dfb4_at_[24.95.99.144]&gt;

&gt;How do I get piston#1 to firing position at TDC?

What they mean is TDC on the compression stroke of cylinder #1--i.e. it has
to be at the top of the stroke, and it has to be the right stroke as well.

To find the top of the stroke, you can remove the spark plug and feel for
it with a stiff wire or something through the spark plug hole. I understand
that in the Type IV taking the spark plugs out is some sort of tortuous
ordeal but it's really the only way if you truly don't have any mark to
refer to.

To find the compression stroke, take the valve cover off and think about
what's going on. First the exhaust valve opens, then it closes. Then
immediately the intake valve opens, then it closes (actually there's some
overlap). After the intake closes, then comes the compression stroke.

Making sense?
