Subject: Re: [T2] Decel valve, '79 cal spec bus

&gt; The decel valve on my bus is bad. Does anyone know of a source for
&gt; replacements? Mine is 039 133 551C, but I suppose 022 133 551C might work as
&gt; well. 
 
The 022C is for 76-79 auto trans buses.
The 039C is for 79 Cal manual trans.
The 022C is a long cylindrical valve that does not move much.
Can you take a picture of your 039C valve and send it to me?
What is wrong with your valve?
