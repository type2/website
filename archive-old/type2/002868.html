Subject: Curious Electrical Problem
Date: Wed, 27 Jun 2001 07:35:26 -0700

This whole thing started a while back when my bus (1973 Transporter)
wouldn't start after I drove it on the highway, or just drove it for more
than say twenty minutes.  After talking about it with my local shop guys,
they recommended that I replace the battery, on the grounds that it was old
and may not be taking a charge, so I did, and the problem still existed, so
I thought perhaps my alternator is bad and not charging my battery (the
alternator light wasn't coming on, but I thought I was on to something),
well the new alternator didn't fix the problem either, actually it made
things worse but I'll get to that in a moment.  I installed the new
alternator without difficulty, or any major difficulties that is, but now
when I turn my key to the on position, my oil light comes on nicely, but my
alternator light and my brake light only come on about halfway, and it takes
them a while to do it, they don't just snap on like they should.  Thinking
that perhaps my voltage regulator was a cause I replaced it also.  Well, now
I'm stuck with two problems, the original one of the bus not starting after
I drive it, and two, the stinking lights aren't working right.  I know that
the two problem lights are connected to each other through the heater fan
switch, and one of the cables is broken on that switch, but is that really
the cause of all this trouble???  Please advise!  I'm starting to have
negative feeling towards the car, as this problem has been persistent for
about 8 months.  Any advice is appreciated!

Yes there are two paths you can go by,
but in the long run, there's still time to
change the road you're on...
