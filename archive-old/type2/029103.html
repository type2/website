Hello all, I have two questions.  #1 How can I tell if my 2L motor has
hydraulic or solid lifters?  The PO doesn't know and the motor has been
rebuilt more than once supposedly.  #2 What rust breaking oils/lubricants
are you using.  All I ever use is WD-40.  You can pmail me if anyone has
some amazing stuff their using, I'm not looking to start some sort of debate
on the list.
Thanks, Marcus
