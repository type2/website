Okay, this is getting out of hand.  :)

First of all, my original reply stating that I lifted the engine was
private and got reposted to the list by mistake (I assume).  This is the
second time in less than a week this has happened to me.

&lt;ADMIN&gt; Please don't post private messages to the list without the author's
permission.  Thanks!&lt;/ADMIN&gt;

Second, I only lift the longblock onto my workbench, not the whole engine.
The longblock weighs around 150 lbs, less without the flywheel which I
usually remove first.  I only do this if there is nobody available to help,
and I follow the proper lifting procedures (i.e. legs, not back).

Third, working on the engine on the floor is probably okay for minor
repairs, but I prefer to have the engine on a bench for bigger jobs like
piston/cylinder removal (which I have done three times on this engine now
to change barrel shim sizes) and engine rebuilding, as I am in a more
comfortable position and have better light and a cleaner work area.
