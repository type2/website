Are you referring to Camp Pendelton?  There is also San Clemente State Park
and
Doheny Beach.  Seems odd no one on list seems to be going to Irvine
Meadows/Verison this w/e.  I was also hoping to meet some of you.

&gt; hey volks,
&gt;
&gt; mebbe this is old news, but i just spoke with the folks that used to be vw
&gt; canvas (in la vernia, tx) and they are no longer in buisiness :-(  i
bought
&gt; one of their awnings for my ex '71 rustfalia back in '97 and it rocked!
and
&gt; only about $150 if i remember correctly. anyone know of a similar
&gt; replacement? i really don't like the rv type of roll-out awning. or the $
&gt; they cost :-(
&gt;
&gt; hope to see some of you at the socal classic this weekend! my daughter,
&gt; nohemi, and i will be camping saturday night at camp pennel (sp?) if
anyone
&gt; is interested.
&gt;
&gt; later,
&gt;
&gt; tony
