Subject: tune up

Volks,
  I just did my tune up on my new 1800 rebuild. Purchased a tune up kit from 
bus depot and installed points , rotor, distr. cap and new plugs. It was 
running ok before but a little rough. I set the points at .016 started it up 
and set the dwell at 45 and tried to set the timing and for some reason it 
does not want to idle at slow speed anymore.  It will idle at about 1150 to 
1200 ok but you take it down to 950 at the rpm they say to set the timing and 
it dies and being I have to set the timing when its at 1250 _at_ +5 right when 
it gets ready to die at 950 the timing jumps over to about +8 - 9 .
  Am I doing something wromg?
  Thankyou

distr.
