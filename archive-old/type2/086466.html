Subject: Re: [T2] how works a thermostat??!! (on a 76 Type IV)

Volks,

Down where i live there was a vw shop that was in business about 40 years
until the owner passed away a year ago.  He made a living off of pulling the
thermostat and flaps off of every motor that ever came into that
place..............self-trained, and had a big clientele.

I have made a decent side income over the last year putting the flaps and
thermostats back in these cars :) .

On the type 4 the flaps are just a must..............the left side one
diverts air thru the oil cooler without it, you are running hot, period.  My
type 4 motor. with flaps and thermostat takes forever to warm up on a really
cold day.  I can only imagine the wear and tear vans take that have this
stuff removed in cold climates.

&gt; hello,
&gt;
&gt; i know that this is a simple concept but i cant seem
&gt; to grasp it. i have researched all the manuals that i
&gt; own( muir, bentley, and haynes) and cannot seem to
&gt; find any understanding.
&gt;
&gt; i know that the thermostat expands when hot and thus
&gt; operates the flap for incresed airflow at higher
&gt; operating temps. right?
&gt;
&gt; what i cant get is this...
&gt;
&gt; if the flap is closed when the piece that holds the
&gt; cable screw is pointed straight up towards the the top
&gt; of the engine bay. then how will an EXPANDING
&gt; thermostat PULL that arm down in order to open the
&gt; flap??? shouldnt it be shrinking??
&gt;
&gt; unless i have this whole thing wrong and the flap is
&gt; actually closed when that little screw piece is down
&gt; and pointing towards the front of the bus, in which
&gt; case an expanding thermostat would in fact serve to
&gt; open the flap by releasing tension on the screw piece.
&gt;
&gt; im so confused!!!!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; anyone who could shed any light on this will be my
&gt; official hero.
&gt;
&gt; as always thanks in advance. any and all answers,
&gt; opinions or insights will be greatly appreciated.
