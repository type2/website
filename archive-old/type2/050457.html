Subject: Re: [T2] Catching Mouses

fatmac99_at_mindspring_dot_com sends:

&gt; Decon is supposed to dehydrate the mouse until it dies, leaving a dead mouse
&gt; that supposedly won't smell.  Supposedly.

D-con causes them to bleed to death internally. It contains Warfarin, the
same stuff people use as a blood thinner. Does the same thing in mice, but
mice always have little cuts in their digestive tracts because of what they
eat. The thinned blood runs right out.

IMO, the mouse trying to get into heaven in the D-con ad who got eaten by a
cat got off easy.
