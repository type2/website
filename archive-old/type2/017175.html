Paul,

	Is the thing you call thermostatic vacuum valve (me, I don't have a
name for it, so we'll go with yours) the little black cookie that sits
in a brace to the right of the oil air cleaner, just above the intake
hole?  If so, the vacuum hose from that attaches to the underside of the
right-hand air-cleaner-&gt;carb bridge.  There should be two nipples on the
underside of that bridge.  One has a hose (or doesn't) that, on the
stock setup, goes to the rubber elbow at the base of of the right intake
manifold, ie the elbow that links the intake manifolds to the brake
booster vacuum line.  The stock right-hand elbow has a spot to which you
can attach this hose, but the elbow is not made by VW anymore, so odds
are you have installed a left-hand rubber elbow (one w/o that vaccuum
line connection, basically just a straight &quot;L&quot; elbow) on the right hand
side of your intake manifold.  That's how I run mine and it's just
fine.  I think that line was there for smog reasons.
	The OTHER nipple on the cleaner-carb bridge is the one that takes the
vacuum line from the termostatic vacuum valve.

	Now, if that cookie *isn't* the thermostatic vacuum valve, can someone
tell me what the heck it is and what it does?  How necessary is that
thing?
