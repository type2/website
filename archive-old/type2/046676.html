&gt; It looks like I toasted a CV.  The boot broke and I ignored it.  Just before I

&gt; the cvs and put new boots on.  The clicking is still there and it's coming from
&gt; the side that was ripped open and the cv grease all over the place.
&gt; 
&gt; Any suggestions?  If they are clicking, can they be taken apart and any rough
&gt; spots polished out or do I just toss them?


Sorry, but if they are bad you toss them.  Get a new one and two new
boots.  You only have to remove the bad joint from the axle, then you can
put both boots on from that side.  I have had excellent luck with Rockford
cv boots (http://www.rockfordcv_dot_com) and not so good luck with Lobro and
Qualitat boots.
