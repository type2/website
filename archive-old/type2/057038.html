Subject: world's coolest running bus!

Just took an 800-mile trip in the '70 from Madison (WI) to Madeline Island
(WI) and back--trip report to come--and discovered something wonderful: All
you people are running way too hot! With my new VDO oil temp and pressure
gauges installed, I discovered that the optimum oil temp for a VW engine on
the highway at 65 mph is about 130 degrees!

I mounted the sender in the sump plate of my Berg deep sump and I swear the
thing never topped 150 degrees. It barely moved off the freakin' peg. If
you note a bit of sarcasm in this message, you are an astute reader. Does
anyone else out there have a VDO oil temp mounted in a deep sump? Does the
damn thing work?

By the way, I mounted my gauges right below the radio opening--how to to
come-- and this is the ABSOLUTE BEST place to mount these babies. Forget
that rubber underdash thingie, it will just get in the way.

Anyway, bolstered by these low oil temps I ran at 80-plus mph the whole
way. Did I mention I was pulling a sailboat? :&gt;
