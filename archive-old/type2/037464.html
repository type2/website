Subject: Major Ivan Hirst has died at 84

LONDON (AP) -- Ivan Hirst, a British army engineer who was instrumental in
putting the Volkswagen into mass production after World War II and getting
the carmaker's famed Beetle to roll off the assembly line, has died at age
84.
Hirst died March 10 at his home in Marsden in Yorkshire, according to a
death notice published in The Times. The cause of death was not announced.
Hirst, then a major in the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, was
sent to Wolfsburg, Germany, in 1945 after British forces took control of the
Volkswagen factory built to turn Adolf Hitler's dream of a ``people's car''
into reality.
The outbreak of war stopped production of the first Volkswagen -- known
today as the Beetle -- before it began, and the factory was turned over to
the task of making military vehicles. The factory was heavily bombed by the
allies and Hirst was one of a group of officers posted there after Germany's
surrender.
``Nobody gave me a real brief. I was just told to go there and do
something,'' Hirst once said.
His assignment was to set up a workshop to repair British vehicles and
dispose of the production line and machine tools. However, no one wanted the
equipment.
A British report at the time concluded: ``the vehicle does not meet the
fundamental technical requirement of a motor car ... it is quite
unattractive to the average buyer.''
However, two Beetles were produced by hand, and Hirst sent one to the army
for a test.
``It seemed a good little car,'' Hirst said. ``I thought it had a chance.''
The British army was so impressed that it ordered 20,000, to be built as war
reparations. By the end of 1945, the factory turned out 1,785. By the next
October, production hit 10,000.
The plant made its first export deal -- with the Pon brothers in Holland --
in 1947.
Hirst left Wolfsburg in August 1949, a month before the company was formally
handed over to a trust run by the West German government.
He later worked in the Foreign Office's German section, then joined the
secretariat of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in
Paris, retiring in 1975.
A widower, Hirst had no children.
