Subject: [T2] Need an Honest Bus Mechanic in NY(southern)

I have recently acquired the Type 2 Bus. It needs a new exhaust
system...heat exchanger and the whole works, Does anyone know an Honest
mechanic that will replace this system for me? I am kinda new to VW and
don't think I'm ready to tackle this kind of job just yet.
