Subject: rims better than new

Last year I:

- Took the tires of the rims (well, had it done for me).
- Had them sandblasted and powder coated (silver, finished with a clear
coat).
- Had the tires put back on, balanced again.

These are the stock steel rims. They now look better than new. I am very
very pleased with the result. These won't need any attention (other than
cleaning) for a very long time.

Total cost was about $45 per rim. That includes tires off/on, balancing, the
lot.
