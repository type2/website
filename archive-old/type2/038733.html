Hi All

I'm a recent owner of a '71 Westy.

One of the &quot;missings&quot; on my bus are the control knobs for the heater/vent
system, and the labels on what lever does what.
Would one of you folks ping me what lever does what so I can at least put a
dymo label on them for the short term?

Thanks - this has turned into my favorite list.
