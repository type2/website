Stephanie:

Doing the brakes and shocks are straight-forward DIY repairs and should be
the first things you try, particularly if you have some knowledgeable help.
Even though the manuals indicate you need to get the rear axle nut off to do
the rear brakes (and another respondent also mentioned this) you *don't*
need to do this.  Plenty of rear brake jobs (probably the vast, vast
majority) have been done without removing the axle nut.

Since this is an old van and you probably don't know its history, you
probably should consider replacing the brake hardware (springs, clips, etc.)
while you're in there, finances permitting.

&gt;
&gt; Here's what wasn't done that they said needed to be: Tie Rod Ends, Outer
&gt; Axle Boot - right rear, front brake pads, front shocks, rear brake
&gt; adjusters and screws.  Oh and the replacing of the carbs (they said it
&gt; wasn't imperative at this moment but that I should really think about it).
&gt;
&gt; Now I've got a some people around here who are much more mechanically
&gt; inclined and I'm armed with four manuals...So I guess the question is:  In
&gt; the above list, considering at this moment I couldn't tell you what a tie
&gt; rod end looks like (I can hear your laughing from here), should I even
&gt; bother trying to get up the gumption to this by myself (with some of those
&gt; more mechanically inclined individuals) or should I just suck it up and
pay
&gt; the mechanics?  I really would like to learn how to do these things, but
&gt; I'd like to walk before I sprint. :) If they would be a good learning
&gt; experience then I'm all for it. (end laughing)
