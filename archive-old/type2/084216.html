Subject: new/resto fiberglass pop-top needed

Hello, 

I'm currently restoring my '78 VW Bus &amp; my pop-top is in pretty bad
shape.  I'm wanting to find a new and/or refurbished fiberglass pop
top.  Ironically, my canvas is still in useable condition, so it's only
the fiberglass shell I need.  I've seen buses around town that appear to
have new white tops on them, but I've not been able to find out where to
get one.  I've tried all over online, resto shops, etc., with no luck.

If anyone knows of how to find one, I'd really appreciate the
information.  I've searched through the type2 archives, but found
nothing I could use.

Please Help!

Thanks, 

Kris
