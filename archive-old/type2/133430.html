&gt; Can anyone tell me what the two knobs, mounted at the front of the
&gt; left/front wheelcasing are all about? One of them turns, the other can be

the push pull controls turning off and on the oil slick you put out behind
your bus while driving,  the controls the amount of oil you lay down in
that slick,

there is no off position.
