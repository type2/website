Subject: Re: [T2] Who turned out the lights?

[...]
suggest you start with the light switch itself.   These are usually 
multicontact switches.  Several times i have chased mysterious light 
problems back to the main light switch and burned out contacts inside. 
(rabbit lost all dash lights, jetta lost tail lights, bug lost 
everything)

&gt; to change
&gt; the dimmer relay to get my high beams working but I haven't gotten 
&gt; around to
&gt; that.  Does anyone have any ideas what could cause this?  I have a
