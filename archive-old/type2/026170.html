The hitches for '68-'71 Busses are a direct bolt on part.  There are
threaded holes on the outside of the frame extensions for the outer 2 pieces
of the unit.  Those 2 pieces hug the frame above the bumper brackets.  Then
the center bar bolts between those 2 pieces.  The tongue has a bolt hole for
a matching hole in the bottom of the bumper.

&gt; 
&gt; Hi folks,
&gt;    I'd like to be able to tow a small trailer with our 71 westy.  What
&gt; does 
&gt; a trailer hitch for an early bay look like?  A verbal desciption would be 
&gt; great, a scetch even better, and a hitch to sell to me would be great.
&gt; I'm 
&gt; just looking to tow a small trailer to carry some bicycles.  Since the
&gt; bikes 
&gt; are tandems a regular type of bike rack is out.
&gt;
