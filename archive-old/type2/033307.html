Subject: Advice on buying VW bus's?

If you buy a $500 dollar bus, and have to purchase / rebuild an engine
and trans, I believe that you would be hard pressed to keep the price
under $3,000 - but then again my experience is with the Vanagon.  Which
has about $3,500 to $4,000 in it and looks terrible, but has a rebuilt
(by me) engine, new everthing brakes, new tires, canvas, seals and I got
the bus for free! 

 My advice is add up the parts -Brakes -  figure new shoes, pads, wheel
cylinders, brakes lines then add turned rotors and drums into the
pictures and bearings and seals, next the engine - just pick a price
froma good builder - add engine compartmet seal, new plugs, filters, dist
cap, etc, add new tires becasue a $500 bus is likely to need them - check
the archives for the proper ones for your bus.  If a camper, might need a
new canvas, pop top seals, etc.

Not saying not to go for it - $500 bus or $2,000 bus, but be aware it
will take more effort, time and money than anticipated.  So... you may
want a running bus that you can use and fix up as you go..or maybe you
would like the re-incarantion.

what ever you choose, put new fuel lines ins first.

---SNIP--- I would like to work or restore a VW bus.
&gt;I dont mind putting in many hours into the bus I buy.
&gt;Just as long as the project doesnt take more than 8 months
&gt;to aleast get it on the road. I am not stupid around cars but
&gt;I am not sure whats to much for me.

&gt;My question is what advice could other VW onwers give on buying?
&gt;Buy a $500 bus fix it up and put in a new engine and maybe trans.
&gt;Buy a $2k bus and do alittle work.
&gt;I would reather spend $500 and put more work in than cash
&gt;yes I do know replacing the parts can be expensive.
&gt;. dont mind spending $3k on the finshed thing.
