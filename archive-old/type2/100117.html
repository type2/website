Subject: Smog and EGR

I have to go for my smog test on Monday and something unfortunate happened
today.

I fit my EGR filter this afternoon which has been missing since 1988 and
after adjusting the timing slightly and following the Bentley instructions
to adjust the linkage to the EGR valve I gave the engine a few revs and the
following happened:

- rpm dropped to stall like levels (engine now runs rough)
- vacuum dropped from 17&quot; to 10&quot;.

I noticed that the molded hose from the s-boot to the decel valve had come
off slightly so I pushed it back on and adjusted the idle with the screw and
it runs smooth again but the vacuum is still way too low at 12&quot;.

I can't feel any leaks from any of the EGR tubes but I'll have to double
check again in the morning when there is more light outside and exhaust is
cold again.

I know the Dolan advice about 15&quot; being on the low end of acceptable and not
to drive with the vacuum any lower but it was only a short trip home and it
ran fine.  If I went outside right now and didn't put the vacuum gauge on I
wouldn't think anything was wrong.

I don't think I heard it backfire but I'm not positive.  I'm wondering if
the gauge is broken but I suspect there really is a big leak now that I
can't locate: for it to drop 5&quot; of vacuum something must have happened
because the engine ran rough right away.

Any suggestions about what to do? I have zero experience with the EGR valve.
