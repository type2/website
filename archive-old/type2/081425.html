To the list.

Just got my bus back he said he had to grind the new alternator to make =
it fit around the cab. =20
Is this some that needs to be done when putting in 71? =20

I was not very happy to a hole in the side of that new alternator when =
pick the bus up.  My goal is to have  that bus for a long time.

Thank you,

Chris Jackson
