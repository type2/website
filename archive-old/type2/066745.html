I'm guessing Thom can't be part of anything like this, since it would be in
competition (or at least a conflict of interest) with his company...unless
of course, they decide not to pursue it and give him a waiver.

Having developed technical documentation and training materials for the last
9 years or so, I'm also guessing that this is a huge project...Like the kind
that only a company can pull off. You could, if you wanted to, burn some CDs
for your friends on the net, but even if you were selling them at cost, all
you'd have to do is have one of them get into the hands of someone whose
material you've used and you'd have a copyright infringement. On the other
hand, you could be on the up-and-up and get permission to reprint stuff on
the CD...but I can't imagine that anyone is going to sign a copyright waiver
to &quot;Type2_at_...,&quot; a non-company.

Sorry to sound so negative. I think it's a great idea for an energetic,
profit-minded entreprenuer who is willing to invest some time and money and
figure out how to negotiate contracts with publishers--I've done it; it
takes a LONG time and it can be expensive...especially if you're asking to
buy their &quot;intellectual property&quot; ...and you can get run over, even if you
know what you're doing. I have tire marks on my back to prove it. 

Anyone seriously involved would have to have a good running bus. You won't
have time to pull engines and rebuild brakes for many months!

&gt;&gt;Yup, nothing has changed.  It's just like marketing almost anywhere in 
&gt;&gt;the world - unless it is *THEIR* idea, it's a no go.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;So guys, since Alldata has apparently crapped out, what do *WE* need to 
&gt;&gt;do to put out our own CD-ROM?
&gt;
&gt;I've got a CD-ROM burner at work. Not sure how many I could knock off as 
&gt;it's not for high volume production, but this sure would be an 
&gt;interesting idea to pursue.
&gt;
&gt;Also, since I work for a software company and we're in the process of 
&gt;burning our software on CD's, I'd be willing to check out the rough 
&gt;price. I'm pretty sure that it's under or around the $2/disk mark.
