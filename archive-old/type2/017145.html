Subject: Re: future travel &amp; I love my bus

Actually, when I think about it, even short travel in the bus are all
memorable to me. I even enjoy driving it to get milk to the corner
store. Maybe it's because I only get to &quot;be&quot; with the bus once a year
for about a month max.! When I'm down there, I even get up at night to
look at its (her?) perfect breadloaf shape. Just before X-mas, while on
business travel to Montreal where the bus is parked, I rented a 1999
J**p Gr*nd Ch*r*k** to get from the airport to the house. The beautiful,
powerful, comfortable and warm SUV then sat in the driveway until my
departure while I used the bus for the weekend, even without heat and
just a 12V fan to defrost the windshield! Sick ehh....
