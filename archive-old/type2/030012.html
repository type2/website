&gt; &gt; &gt; I'll weigh in in favor of the Kirkland 195/75R14C - I've got 'em and
&gt; &gt; &gt; have been very happy.  Can't beat the price, at least around here.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The load range C version of the 195/75R14 tire doesn't have the
&gt; &gt; load rating (1540 lbs) needed for a bus.  In fact, I was surprised to
&gt; &gt; find that
&gt; &gt; the load rating is less than the passenger version of the 185R14 size,
&gt; &gt; after I got talked by the friendly tire man into thinking that it was
&gt; &gt; &quot;exactly the same&quot;!  You need to get the D range if you have to go with
&gt; &gt; the 195/75 size.

&gt; Hm...  Pulled out the owners manual for some refs...  The 195/17R14's
&gt; are rated at 1435...
&gt; 
&gt; Much to my surprise - the tire recommended is a 185...  Wider, right? 
&gt; Either 6 or 8 ply...  Would the wider tire take it from 1435 to 1540???

Some oddities of the tire trade are in action here.

The larger the section number, the higher the load rating for a given
size.  an 85 section (which is the default section number) is stronger in
a give size and load range than a 75 section.  In order of strength from
strongest to weakest, here are the tires used on buses:

185R14 Load Range D
185R14 Load Range C
195/75R14 Load Range D
185R14 Passenger
195/75R14 Load Range C

Strange, isn't it!  I guess that a squatter section relies more on the
tire structure to support the load and less on the air.

&gt; Where do you get the 1540?

From the owners manual of my '71.
