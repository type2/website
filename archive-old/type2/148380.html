&gt; In any case, I asked some of my cousins there and they said that there used

&gt; particular Cooper Minis and classic Volkswagens.
&gt; 
&gt; It works both ways...Some years ago (during the 80's) when the 
collectable/antique
cars were reaching bubble prices, European dealers were criss crossing the 
USA
buying up almost anything and shipping them back to Europe. BTW, 
globalization
has hit here, too, as restoration shops have opened in Eastern Europe to take 
ad-
vantage of lower labor costs...
