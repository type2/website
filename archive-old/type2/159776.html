Subject: Re: [T2] blocking heater box air to get more cooling air

Been there- I simply blocked the accordion pipes with foil tape assuming 
more air would now go over the cylinders in summer- but remember hot 
exhaust air still goes through the boxes -so any oil that is guaranteed 
to drip on the now hot heater boxes will be immolated and those behind 
you think you are on fire.........the heated air is dumped out of the 
generic flapper boxes; there was (in 78?) extender pipes that moved the 
hot air to the rear so it would not heat the cylinders above, but these 
pipes really get in the way of putting in the valve covers.

  You'd melt down the HE's. They're designed to have air flowing through
  them whenever the engine's running. The control boxes just control
  where it goes. Either to the cabin or dumped outside.
