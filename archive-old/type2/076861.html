Subject: Re: [T2] ?charging problem

I would check the voltage going to the battery from the regulator at
different revs and make sure you have 12v or more. I don't have a
comprehensive understanding of the charging system but that will at least
tell you if there is indeed a charging problem.
Honestly every bus I've had did this to some degree so it may not be
anything to worry about.
How old is your battery?
Is it cold where you are?
Some things to think on.
Good luck

&gt; My lights keep going bright then dim in conjunction with the engine revs
&gt; also noticed that the bus appears to be getting a little harder to
&gt; start-cranking over 3-4 times as opposed to first time previously.Already
&gt; changed the belt and tensioned it but no difference-is the regulator on
its
&gt; way out or the generator/dynamo.It's a'71 by the way-thanks for any
&gt; advice-Martin
