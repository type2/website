Subject: Rear Brakes: Was &quot;Westy Rides Again&quot;
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hey Folks,
     Thanks for all the replies. Everyone suggested checking rear brake 
adjustment, which I will do. Noticed a new symptom today though. At idle the 
brake pedal feels hard, not much travel. When braking from speed, it feels 
soft. Vacuum leak? One way check valve? Thanks again for all the replies.   
Jeff S.
