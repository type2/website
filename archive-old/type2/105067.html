&gt; I finally got my hands on a bugpack catalog (#24) and noticed that shown on page 39 are Type 4 finned aluminum valve covers (4540) that bolt onto the rocker arms (no bails). I thought these were only available for Type 1 engines and now I'm excited. Has anyone tried them?

Haven't tried them, but I too am tempted.  One thing I worry about is how they are fastened down.  I assume you must replace the rocker arm studs with longer ones.  These studs are not very thick and were not designed to cope with the added stress of holding down the valve covers.  Maybe it's not important, but it bothers me.  I would feel better if they were held down by all four studs, but I bet it's only two.
