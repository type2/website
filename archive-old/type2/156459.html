&gt;  Oh La,
&gt; I have a 70' camper, and although i am a mechanic
&gt; and should know the awnser to this question, i've
&gt; never felt this particular problem before. 
&gt; 
&gt; As I am turning the steering wheel, if feels like
&gt; it's hmmmm....skipping or binding...

I suppose there could be a broken or egg shaped ball
in there. When you adjusted, you should have just
barely taken the slack out and not any more...

I had a situation a couple years back where the bus
was wandering. On further study, it was not wandering
- I was over-compensating to a sticky ball joint. I
put new ball joints on it and about a year later
developed a squeek like maybe 100 decibels or more!
Soon I noticed the wandering again and a slight
resistance when turning - but not while the front end
was in the air. I ended up drilling and tapping the
ball joints for zerk fittings and when greased up, the
problems went away. Not too thrilled about how soon
the new ball joint started seizing up, but will get
enough service out of it this way. -BaH
