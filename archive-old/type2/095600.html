&gt; Greatful Dawg
&gt; Story of Jerry Garcia and the Greatful Dead

&gt; (talk about bus sightings! i bet there are a MILLION of em in there!)


Supposedly my bus (well, my former bus; I've sold it since then) is in other
Grateful Dead documentary movie, called Tie Died.  It's a red and tan '77
Westy, with a big &quot;steal-your-face&quot; tire cover on the nose (with a VW logo
in the skull).   Probably parked next to a high-top Adventure Camper.
