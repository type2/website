&gt;I am looking for the VDO kit 150752 to finally install the oil pressure
&gt;sender that has lived in my glove box for about 7 years now. It consists
&gt;of a hose with fittings and a clamp.
&gt;
&gt;Bus Boys and Busdeopt do not show it in stock. Does anyone have one
&gt;they could part with or know of a supplier?

CIP1 is also out. Try a websearch: a large VDO vendor is www.egauges_dot_com.

Local speedo repair shops would be good to try also. Like these:
