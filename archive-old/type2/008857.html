Hey Volks-
	I've got a 1600 DP with 8,000 miles on it.  I went out yesterday and
started it and smoke pored out of the tail pipe.  It was oil.  Does
anybody have any idea why this happened?  It only does it on initial
start up after that its fine.  I hope it is due to my faulty fuel pump
but I dont know?  Thanks for your help.
