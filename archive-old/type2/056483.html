&gt;It's true though! Joe Fournier put an oil temp in his sump and from then on
&gt;he was always watching that guage and now he drives like an old lady

Ken, you don't know what the fudge you're talking about! I run my bus right up to the red line! ...like all *real men* do! The gauge is only there for looks...and to keep you greasy-fingered Shelby County knuckleheads confused.

Gauges are about information. If you're into it, get gauges; if you'd rather weld magnesium, do without.

...installing vacuum gauges next. So there! ;) Joe
