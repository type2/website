Subject: engine install woes

------=_NextPart_001_0000_01C20327.973B29C0

Well, after getting the engine in my 69, I realized my throttle cable was=
 not put in beforehand.  Seems to be 2 holes in my firewall, one that loo=
ks close enough to be the one the throttle cable goes through.  But......=
  the engine seal is covering the hole.  Wondering if it needs a cut in i=
t.  Never had an engine in this bus, as I bought it in pieces and just fi=
nished the process of putting the engine together.  Looked in the Bentley=
, and in the Haynes, even the Muir, and did not find a diagram showing me=
 how everything comes through the firewall, and shroud.  Also only one ho=
le left in the firewall is on the passenger side, and seems to be the onl=
y place to get the gas line through.  Thinking of just taking a metal lin=
e, running it through the firewall, and routing a gas line around the shr=
oud rather than through, to cut down on fire hazard, and more so that I c=
an't seem to find where it could come through the shroud.  It is a 71 dua=
l port doghouse style going in.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.=
  The wasps have started making nests in my bus!                       HP=
