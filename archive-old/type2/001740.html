the problem is that i have been told i need a new &quot;air
intake elbow&quot; but can't seem to find this part anywhere.  I
thought i was perhaps calling the part by a wrong name but
I saw this part refered to in a posting yesterday,

This won't help you find the part you're after but what I've found really
useful is a parts book with drawings and numbers on. VW Heritage do them -
mine was only 6 pounds about 2 years back, and these are the same pics that
VW dealers have on microfiche. If you get stuck I'll fax you the page. Then
armed with a proper designation you may have more luck when you come to ask
around.
