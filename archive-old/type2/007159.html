I've just completed about an hour of archive research so I hope that
what I am about to ask is a new question.

Has anyone tried to mount the upright posts (square steel tubes) for a
bike rack onto the brackets which are originally used to mount the two
bumper extensions?  I am referring to the optional extensions which came
on the front bumper of my 78 Westy.  

I removed  the battered old bumper extensions but saved the steel-strap
brackets which conform to the bumper shape and have little &quot;claws&quot; on
each end to grip the upper and lower edges of the bumper.  

Now I am hoping to use the brackets as the anchor of my ACAR model
31-8-2  bike rack.  When I tried this yesterday the weight of the bike
on the rack caused the upright posts to lean to far away from the body.
Perhaps I can use the spare tire mount as a third anchor for the rack
with some kind of bracket.  

Does anyone have extra bumper extensions that they would like to sell?
Any other suggestions about bike mounting on the front?  Please contact
me directly as well as the list since I am a digest subscriber.

Thanks!
Ed
