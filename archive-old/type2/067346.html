Subject: Canadian vanagon

On the way home from the parts store, the kids spotted a vanagon camper
essentially identical to my 81 just around the corner. With the olympics
there are a lot of folks visiting Atlanta. We did a slow roll by this one and
it had B.C. plates (but no V_at_L sticker). 

Interestingly, I at first thought that it had only two outlets on the left
side but then spotted the electrical outlet below, close to the rocker. I
recall from the busboys catalog I think that there were some different specs
on the canadian model wiring. Do Canadian regs require the lower placement of
the electrical outlets?

Thanks,

Weston
