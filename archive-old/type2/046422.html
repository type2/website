&gt;I went to a VW show and swap meet this weekend and have been to several in
&gt;the last 6 months or so. I am finding very few Split Window buses in the
&gt;shows, or attending, and even fewer body parts in the swap areas. I was
&gt;talking to some of the swappers and they were saying that there are just
&gt;hardly any stuff out there anymore.
&gt;
&gt;Maybe we can have a survey here: Are Split Window buses and parts getting
&gt;that rare? Does anybody know a single large source for Split Window stuff?
&gt;

when i lived in baton rouge about 15 years ago i spotted two splits off of 
fla blvd by the mall in a yard, so i stopped to check them out....there was 
at least thirty splits behind the house!...i talked to the lady who lived 
there and she said her son &quot;collected them&quot; (they were all in unrestored 
condition)..she even showed me a BMW bubble car under an old tarp...now that 
was cool.....anyways if you are in south louisiana you might check it out, 
don't know if they are even there any more....i live in the ozarks now...
