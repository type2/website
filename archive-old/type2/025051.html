&gt; I picked up my first type 2 on Sunday, a 1978 1600cc Holdsworth (uk)
&gt;  conversion with twin sliding doors, its very solid but the cab doors will
&gt;  need skining and it'll need a respray before next winter. I have two
&gt;  questions, firstly I need to replace the engine bay seal, I would presume
&gt;  this is easy enough to do but not sure, any pointers? Secondly my pop top 
is
&gt;  sagging slightly in the middle and is gathering water, is there anything I
&gt;  can do about this or will I just have to make sure the skylight seal is
&gt;  extra waterproof? thats all for now, thanks for any help,

Hi Brian,

Welcome to the VW Camper owning world.

The engine compartment seal is easy to fit - its a long falt foam rubber 
strip with a slot in each side that goes onto the tin and the body work. 
Getting the bit behind the fan shroud can be a bit ackward but not 
impossible. The seal is important as it is will stop hot air recirculating 
into the cooling system.
There are two different sizes one for pre '72 buses and one for 72 onwards. 
You will obviously need the later one.

Holdsworth conversions were fitted mostly fitted with the straight up style 
of poptop with concertina sides (same as many Devon conversions) so I'll 
assume thats what you got.
The centre of the roof is a large alluminium sheet which is given shape and 
ridgity by a frame fitted to the inside with poprivits.
To prevent the sag you will need to remove the headliner on the inside, any 
covering on the out side. remove broken poprivits and fit new ones.
Remarkable improvement - my previous 73 Devon was two inches taller when I 
fixed the roof!

If that not the type of roof you have then take a look at www.vwt2oc_dot_org_dot_uk 
use the no frames mode with javascript turned off (java script pre-caches the 
pictures and generates the pages without refering to the server so you see no 
URL) or netscape with no frames because netscape behaves diferently and 
e-mail me the URL of a van picture with a roof the same as yours.

Good luck
