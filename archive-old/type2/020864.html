Subject: 69 bus for sale

I am lowering the price of the bus to 1400. I really need to sell this
thing. If no one buys it in whole. I'm probably gonna take the engine
out and put it in the 67 Westy, then scrap the rest of the bus. Any one
interested let me know. The engine only has 2500 miles on it. I bought
the engine from a local engine guy who comes to the Manassas Bug Out
every year.
