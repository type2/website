=========================&gt;
Andy,
I really did not mean to be saying that.
Perhaps I did not do a very good of stating my belief on the matter.
Please forgive me.

What I was attempting to say was, at operating temperature equilibrium, 
the oil will run at the same temperature with, or without, additional 
sump volume.

With an auxiliary (additional volume) oil sump bolted on to, and under 
the engine, it will take longer for the (increased) oil volume to come 
up to the engine's full operating temperature.

Eventually, the total mass of the oil (now, maybe 4.5 quarts, or 
whatever) will reach the same temperature as the original 3 quart 
volume was reaching.

On very cool days, this might not be the case, as those auxiliary oil 
sumps do have a small amount of fins built into them, and they are 
exposed to outside cool air, but I would estimate that the overall 
temperature drop will be so small, and so infrequent, as to make that 
perceived advantage of an auxiliary oil sump almost non-existent.
