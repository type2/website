Volks,

Thanks for all the suggestions... especially to Michael Benthin for the offer 
of a double relay from a FI system.  I had read the info about the VW/Audi 
relay, but when I was getting ready to put in the pump, I was dressed for the 
office, and on the way home.... hence, a stop at Radio Shack for the relay 
there.  [thanks John C. for the suggestion]... it is a four pin relay, Cat. 
No. 275-226, called a 30 Amp Auto Relay.

Based on all the info I could find (plus the Archives coming back up...thanks 
Tom), I installed it this afternoon....took off early from work.  I took the 
12V in straight from the battery, the 12V out goes to the fuel pump.  The (-) 
comes from the coil (-) terminal...number 1.  The &quot;switched&quot; power I took 
from the blue wire to the booster fan relay... As Jamie states, that blue 
wire only has power when the engine is running/cranking.  I made up a test 
light to check this all out... had my son do the cranking.

Haven't gotten it to fire yet, but that is because the battery is weak... 
this bus has been sitting for a looong time.... it didn't run well for quite 
a while, and I pulled the original engine before Christmas.... so the battery 
is on a charger at the moment.

As to the thought that if the Alternator went bad, or the belt broke.... I 
think that I would want the fuel pump to shut off... and stop the engine in  
a bit.... remember, it will take a bit to empty the bowls on this Carb'd 
engine.....

.... also, with full float chambers, it should catch and spin up the 
Alternator quick enough that the low voltage won't be a problem.  At least 
that is the hope.

Thanks once again to all.... I have combined all the suggestions that I used 
into this message so that it gets into the Archives.... maybe it will help 
others.
