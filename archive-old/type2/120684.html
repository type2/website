Subject: Starting a road trip, need advice

&gt;I need a computer and don't have a decent laptop. 
&gt;Could I run a desktop off a inverter or is that just
&gt;completely nuts. I would have to get an LCD monitor
&gt;which is fairly low power.

By the time you buy a big enough inverter to run a
desktop (would need at least a 300-400 watt inverter,
to the tune of $100 - $200) and buy an LCD monitor
(cheapest I've seen lately is around $250), you can
buy a good used laptop that should do everything you
need it to -  Lotsa used 700-800Mhz laptops on eBay
and the web for ~$500, and you can run them using a
$20 100w cigarette lighter inverter from Radio
Shack.... not to mention you can take it with you when
you aren't in the Bus, into the coffe shop, etc.

&gt;Also has someone had experience using a spring pcs
&gt;phone as a wireless modem?

Don't know about Sprint - I tried unsuccessfully to
get my PDA &amp; PCS phone to communicate with Verizon's
network (at the time it was Airtouch, they have since
merged with Verizon).  I know Larry at Roadhaus_dot_com
has been using Verizon's wireless data service, which
is what I would probably go with (Verizon has the best
coverage by far in my experience).  More info at his
page or verizonwireless_dot_com ...
