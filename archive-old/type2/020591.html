Subject: Re: [T2] Push Rod Tube Removal
References: &lt;4a.11950681.27bee80a_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I had a 71 bus and remember using 2 piece pushrod tubes that telescoped
apart as a nut was turned using threads on one of the halves.  An O-ring
was between the halves.  It should be possible to use such tubes by
leaving the engine in the bus- pull the valve covers, pull the rockers,
pull the pushrods, crimp out or saw the old tubes in half, and insert
the telescoping tubes.  Are these still available?
