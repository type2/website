Subject: Re: [T2] need new engine

Buy an Outback and go home happy. In the end this will be a much cheaper 
option or buy a EuroVan. My friend got one on ebay for $3500.

Seriously this is a huge waist of money and time for something that is and 
always will remain a 1979 bus.

-My two cents.

&gt;&gt; I found a great place to buy used engines and since i was looking i 
&gt;&gt; decided
&gt;&gt; to just go all out and put in a subaru engine. I have a 79 bus. Does 
&gt;&gt; anybody
&gt;&gt; out there recommend any. Im thinking a 1800 turbo. but im not sure if it 
&gt;&gt; will
&gt;&gt; fit or not. Any advice is appriciated.
