Subject: Re: [T2] review of &quot;Little Miss Sunshine&quot;

&gt;&gt;  This week's  http://www.journeywithjesus_dot_net includes a review:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  ** The film &quot;Little Miss Sunshine&quot;
&gt;
&gt;Gee, the reviewer gives away the entire plot in one paragraph.  No need to
&gt;see the movie now...  :(

	yes I would resent that if I were yet to see the film.  I was 
assuming we'd been about the last in line to get the movie, i.e most 
elsewhere would have seen it already if they were ever going to.
	But it was a v good summary of the characters, and I thought 
the moral assessment was fine.

&gt;
&gt;BTW, Little Miss Sunshine was enjoyed by a couple of dozen folks who
&gt;braved the cold at BBB.  Always fun to hear applause when the star of the
&gt;film (the bus) makes its appearance!

	It wouldn't matter to more than a tiny fraction of the 
audience, but I thought the generally suave body was difficult to 
reconcile with the side door's coming off.  But maybe it had been 
face-lifted by MarioResto.   ;-)


cheers
