Subject: Electric problem and a bastard engine recepie

	Hi, 

	Got my spare engine in place yesterday. It runs perfect even if it´s  a
real &quot;bastard&quot;, put together from what I found under the workbench in my
garage. You´ll get the recepie further on in this mail.  Howewer a &quot;funny&quot;
electrical problem got me mailing the list. The bus is a ´71 kombi called
&quot;Dinosaurius Anorexia&quot; ( it sounds like a dinosaur but is too small to be one)

	This is what happens: When i turn the key into &quot;run&quot; position the
generator light doesn´t light up the and gas meter doesn´t move. When I
start the engine everything is normal until I put on the turn signal, then
the generator light goes on and the turn signal doesn´t work. When I turn
the turnsignal off the generator light glows. Sometimes &quot;fiddeling&quot; with
the other switches or starting the engine again helps. Sometimes it works
just fine.

	Before pulling the old engine out (got a crack in the engine block) there
was another sypthom: when I put the key in &quot;run&quot; position some relay
started ticking and the genrator light blinked in the same pace. I´m now
suspecting there´s a loose contact somewhere under the dash since I´m using
the same generator as before. Anybody with some good ideas where to start
looking?

	Now over to the &quot;bastard&quot; engine. It´s a real &quot;scraped together off what
you got left from ten years of VW-hobbysism&quot;. The short block is a gift
from a friend who said he will newer buy a aircooled VW again. He´s driving
a -72 bug teese days....  Had some 88mm cylinders left over from a old
project, I belive they aren´t very bad. 

	The heads are single port. The threads for some off the exhaust studs were
gone long ago, threaded to 10mm already. Found an exellent solution tough:
Case savers, It´s possible to drill the holes up to 12mm and thread in the
14mm case savers. Just don´t drill too deep into the head:-) 

	The exhaust is a type1 but the whistles are replced with five inches long
and two inch diameter pipes. Left over from my younger days...Had to bend
them down a little to clear the rear apron. Loud pipes saves lifes.

	The manifold is a combination off a old single port one and a dual port
center part with the servo outlet. The distributor is a Marelli from a
Fiat, yes it fit with some modifications. Don´t mention advance curves :-)
It´s just set to max 27degrees. At idle it´s about 0. The engine started at
once and pulls real good!!

	This engine will have to do untill I get my Type4 engine and trans ready.
Oops! Here comes another question: Is there an easy way to tell a type1
engines trans from a type 4 trans? The jukyard is full off Busses but here
in Finland Busses was sold with both type1 and type4 engines trougout 1979.


	TIA

Happy again to be Busborne!

Yours Uffe.
