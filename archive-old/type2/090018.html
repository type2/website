Subject: Re: [T2] RE: 1700 fuel injection: Is it possible?

&gt; The other system referred to as I jet, more commonly known as AFC

OK, so I should have used a capital &quot;L&quot; (el) instead of a lowercase one since a 
lower case &quot;l&quot; looks like a capital &quot;I&quot; (eye) in some fonts.  But I really did 
refer to it correctly.

D-Jet FI is no more difficult to trouble-shoot and maintain than &quot;L&quot;-jet.  It's 
just a question of which system you want to master.  But as I mentioned 
earlier, L-Jet is a more modern, more advanced system than d-Jet.  I suppose if 
I didn't know either of them and was ready to learn, I'd choose L-Jet.
