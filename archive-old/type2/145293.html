Not that unusual of a story.  I have a sailboat alcohol stove and RDF unit
that a friend left with me for safekeeping years ago.  I don't think I'll
auction them, though!

However, I am very leery of any odd twists in auto dealing.  There is
enough fraud out there that it pays to be paranoid.  If it doesn't have a
clear title verified by the DMV, I pass.
