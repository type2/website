Subject: BA-6? &amp; BN-4?

Hello.

     I got a BA-6 gas heater for my bus, (finally no more freezing)
Anyway I need those rubber mount pieces, there is 3 of them. They look
like the one's used on the FI fuel pump mount, used to cut down
vibration. Anyone know what they are called, or part #, or better yet
where to get them? I've looked in my RMMW catalog but didn't see them.
If I knew what they were called I might have a better chance finding
them.

     Also a friend of mine just got a BN-4, but is missing the wiring
cover, Does anyone have one laying around that they would part with? If
so let me know.

Ps. I might have more questions coming about the BA-6, so this is just a
warning. LOL!

Thanks,
Shawn Reed
