Subject: Re: [T2] My carb has a hole !

Differential expansion is what &quot;eats&quot; these plugs.  The carburetor casting
and the plug are made of different metals.  After a bunch of heating and
cooling cycles the plugs loosen in the casting, then vibration or a backfire
through the carb finishes the job.

It's likely that the plug is lying in the tin under the crankshaft pulley,
or on the engine somewhere around the carburetor.  If you find it, it can be
reinstalled by lightly peening the rim of the opening to trap the plug.  A
little JB Weld or equivalent will seal the opening and complete the job.

I've repaired several of these by using sheet lead cut to size and peened in
with a punch about the same size as the opening.  A dab of sealant completes
the job, but just peening in the plug will get you home OK.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  When I got home, I opened the engine door, looked inside, and
immediately saw that the &quot;plug&quot; in my carburetor was missing.  You know,
that metal disc that seems to be on there for whatever reason, held in by
whatever holds it.  I can actually look inside my carburetor and see the
innards.

OK, so how does one go about getting a replacement plug, and how is same
held in place in that hole?  &lt;&lt;
