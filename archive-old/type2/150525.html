&amp;gt; &amp;gt; Hi Dan,
&amp;gt; &amp;gt;
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; Rather than ramps, I would recommend buying jack stands.  Good
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; i have a set of 2 ton jack stands.  i just get a little scared working
&amp;gt; under the bus with them.  nothing i have every taken off under there has
&amp;gt; come off easily.  it always requires pulling and hammeringg and that
&amp;gt; freaks me out a little.  anyway i'll go with the jack stands this time.
&amp;gt; i can just jack up the side i'm working on and leave the other on the
&amp;gt; ground?

When I do CVs, I just put a floor jack under the shock mount and jack the
tire just barely off the ground.  You can safely work under the car then
as long as you make sure that you have a few inches of clearance between
you and the bus.  This is easy with a bus, but I'd never do it with a low
modern car!  Leaving the tire on means that you can pull against it to
hold the CV still while wrenching.
