&gt;Forgive my ignorance, but what do you mean by &quot;without EGR&quot;...simply that 
&gt;the
&gt;filter is clogged and ineffective, or do you also remove the vacuum line to 
&gt;the
&gt;valve...?
&gt;
&gt;I just installed a new EGR filter and notice a sigificant change in idle 
&gt;when
&gt;the valve is disconnected, ie. it idles faster &amp; better disconnected. 
&gt;Trying to
&gt;get this engine to pass smog is like trying to tune a sitar...
&gt;
&gt;

You have the wrong vacuum going to your EGR valve. Must be a 74-75? 76 and 
later use mechanical EGR valves. It is controlled by linkage to the throttle 
housing.
You need to find the correct vacuum line for yours. It should be ported 
vacuum like the one going to the vacuum advance. It should ONLY have vacuum 
when you open the throttle, NOT at idle.
