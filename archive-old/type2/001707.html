This is a link to the website of a couple traveling through S. America [and
eventually E. Africa] in a '78 Westfalia that has been modified for the
journey, and to the page on that site covering the vehicle.  Toward the
bottom of the page is a photo of their custom-built rear spare tire and
jerry can mount.

This camper also has a new 1600SP engine.  They apparently acquired the
camper in the USA, but they don't offer any explanation for the 1600 in a
'78 bus.

FWIW.....
