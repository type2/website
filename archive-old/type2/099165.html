Subject: Update on Source for Vacuum leak was Re: [T2 ]Source for vacuum
  leak  discovered

Hi All:

I found and ordered the seal for the throttle body. ETKA had the part
number listed. It is 022-133-069. VW still stocked the item, though I am
not sure for how long. Ouch it was $6.27. Anybody know if this is
available out of the VW system?

Anyway I took the throttle body apart. The seal is the only thing
keeping the throttle body from leaking vacuum. The outcome was that I
increased my vacuum 1 inHg (now I am about 16 inHg at idle when cold,
still not what I want) and improved my gas mileage to about 18 mpg.

Hope that this helps.

Regards,
