Hi Volks,

I spent the better part of Sunday under my '72 playing with my mechanical
fuel pump.  As you know, it was leaking fuel out of the breather hose and so
I bypassed it with an electrical.  After taking the mechanical apart, I
found the diaphragm  was split and there was my original leak.  I had picked
up a spare mechanical pump, used, from a boneyard, but it turned out to be
Brazilian and I was reluctant to replace my broken VW pump with it.  I tried
to replace my broken diagram with the one from the Brazilian pump, but it
doesn't fit.  The pushrod on the back of the diaphragm is a different
configuration. 

So, anyway, does anyone know where I can get a diagram for a VW mechanical
fuel pump for a '72 1700?
