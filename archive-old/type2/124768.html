Subject: several buses at newark, ca scrapyard

I couldn't believe my eyes, they had so many. I mean, in all my time
scrapping I have only come across a couple, scattered through many yards.
Most of these in Newark were very picked over; it looked like the same
person went through the entire yard and took the same kinds of parts from
every old VW. But, still -- parts are parts. You get them where you can.

Pick-N-Pull, Newark _at_ 7400 Mowry Blvd. Don't bother calling them, they don't
keep a listing of what vehicles are in the yard.

I've seen a '68 Kombi/Campmobile, and I think a '74 and '78 Loaf (both still
had bumpers!); buses are toward the front left of the yard, look for the
pop-tops to guide you. Can't remember the rest. Several Westies. One Ghia
(picked down through the floorboards), a couple Beetles. (The cars were in
the far back right corner of the yard.)

Happy Diving,
