Subject: thermostat conversion?
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hello List,

I was reading through the archives and was looking for
some more information on thermostat replacement. I
remember reading somthing about being able to replace
the type 4 engine thermostat with an type 1
thermostat. I read that you just had to unscrew
somthing on it and the type 4 cable would screw right
in? 

Has any one ever replaced their type 4 thermostat with
a Type 1 thermostat? If so, you suggest doing it ? Is
there any modification needed to fit it? Will it work
just as well? I couldn't find much information on a
conversion.

I tried to find a type 4 thermostat at my local flaps
and VW dealership but with no luck so far. Thanks for
the advice!
