Subject: Re: [T2] Sythetics, and air cooled engines

Terry-

Maybe I misunderstood you here. This article seems to inducate that,
compared to automotive oils, motorcycle oil doesn't even work very well in a
motorcycle. It does make a good case for choosing synthetics over mineral
based oils, but I didn't think that was your point. Since the testing didn't
include your preferred 'Golden Spectro' oil, the article gives no support at
all to your &quot;feeling&quot; that it has better sheer retention than other oils.

So, tell me again why this should change my mind about the stuff I'm using?

Dave, who's always up for a good debate

Motorcycle Oils vs. Automotive Oils


Check this out--it explains viscosity loss due to heat and mileage---and
shear values of the stuff you using.

It'll change your mind about the stuff your using---

Later,

Terry
