&gt; I attached the mount to the bus in the stock method 4x 10-28 fine threaded

&gt;
&gt; This is the same mount that came on the bus when i got it and the same
&gt; mount I have seen on other vans so I think it is may be the OEM mount.
&gt;
&gt; Remember the weight of the tire is on the bumper and the mount only keeps
&gt; it from falling off the front of the bus.
&gt;
&gt; It is stout enough to allow me to carefully climb onto the cab roof
&gt; (luggage rack) because again there is no weight on the nose.

this seems like a pretty dangerous proposition, since the first indication
of the wheel coming loose will come after the damage is already done!

Why not just open one of the doors and stand on the wheel arch?
