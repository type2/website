Subject: Fire Warning

Get a $50 ABC extinguisher with a METAL trigger on the top -- not
plastic. Check
it once a month to make sure it's holding its charge. A pair of
steelworker's
gloves, long heavy leather gloves might not be a bad investment if you
have to
lift the bus engine lid with flames shooting out of it... YMMV...
