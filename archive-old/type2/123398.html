Subject: Torsion Issue Photo

Greetings,

78 Westy

Here is a photo my my front end. The bus is not being supported by a jack or 
anything else, it is on the ground supported by the tires. Should the upper 
torsion arm rest on the rubber stop like this? I don't think so. If anyone 
has a photo of what this is supposed to look like (or know where one is ) I 
would love to see it. I would look at my other bus but it is a snowy hour 
plus drive away.

When changing out my ball joints a while ago one of the torsion bars pretty 
much had three broken leaves. So I got some used ones and now this after two 
tries.  Theories abound but the issues seems to be the torsion bars or the 
angle of them? There is no bind in the torsion tube with the torsion arms 
and the other side (passenger) is exactly the same. Shouldn't there be 
roughly the same distance above and below the rubber stops and trailing 
arms?  Also, I have not driven and don't plan to drive until I fix this.

Thanks,
Brandt

Also, here are a few photos of my project if you are interested. Lots of 
work...
