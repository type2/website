&gt; &gt;I presume if I calibrate fuel mix with
&gt; &gt;EGR online and later take it offline the
&gt; &gt;mix will be a little richer than optimum
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think that's the case, Bob.  Unless you're messin' with
&gt; something other than the idle mixture adjustment, it shouldn't make any
&gt; difference, because the EGR valve is closed at idle.

Good point, Giff. Manuals say to adjust fuel mix at idle. But smog tests
are conducted at idle and also at higher rpm. I'll bet smog guys tweak it
at higher rpms too if necessary to get it to pass smog. In any case, I
think I still stand by my original suspicion: even if you set the fuel mix
at idle when the functioning EGR is closed, the engine was designed to
have that extra gas input from the EGR at mid range rpms. If EGR is
disconnected and that extra gas is not going into the plenum, then
wouldn't things be running a bit leaner, all other things being equal,
than it would with EGR connected? Or richer, but in any case, different?

I'm still trying to understand all the mysteries of the FI system re. 
airflow metering and fuel mix.
