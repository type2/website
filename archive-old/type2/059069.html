&gt; Does anyone have a set of bolt-on valve covers for a type 4 motor they

&gt; bloody things off and the leaks when I put them back on.  (And yes, I
&gt; use new gaskets glued with Super Weatherstrip Adhesive to the flat,
&gt; clean covers and grease on the head side of the gasket.)  I've been
&gt; doing type 1 motors for years.  Leak free.  Type 4 motor, can't get them
&gt; sealed.  New, used, it doesn't really matter.  The only ones I've been
&gt; able to find are from the Por$che Part$ $upplier, Automotion.

    I use copper RTV silicone on *both* sides of the gasket, but then
since I've hydraulic lifters, I don't take them off much either. But
they don't leak.
