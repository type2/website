Many thanks to all who responded to my disappearing exhaust bolt dilema.
I received about ten messages in less than a day, all with slightly
different suggestions. For anyone that's interested and for the sake of
the archives I've listed the suggestions below:

- Use automotive grade hardware (grade 5) rather than standard over the
counter hardware (grade 2). Automotive grade tends to have a finer
thread. And use METRIC sizes.
- Use a combination of flat washer under the bolt head, flat washer and
lock washer under the nut.
- Try to avoid using the cheap rubber gaskets that come with a
aftermarket exhaust kit, get your hands on some good metal gaskets. The
breakdown of the rubber gaskets were probably the root cause of my
problem. (When I attached my new muffler for the SECOND time I used the
old metal gaskets that went with my dead muffler, excellent results even
after years of use!)
- After you keep all the above in mind add a little loc-tite for piece
of mind.

Again, &quot;Stella&quot; thanks all those who took the time to reply.

Cheers,
