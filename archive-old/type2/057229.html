The Rules

When they step up inside, as you go for a ride,
And the first thing they see are The Tools,
Then they'll ask with a smirk if you do your own work,
Cause they have no idea of The Rules.

For it's tried and it's true: What you carry with you
Will help you get back; and it's certain
What you leave back at home, as the country you roam,
Will not help on the road when you're hurtin'.

As you go through the years, you will learn from your tears
All the tools you will need on the road,
And you increase the weight, in attempts to cheat Fate,
Adding more and more tools to your load.

Now, it's sad, but in trucks, fuel economy sucks,
And gets worse with all that stowed aboard.
But the point we make here is that gas ain't so dear ...
Don't let tools and spare parts be ignored.

So the bus weighs a lot. Even more when you've got
All the spare parts your money can buy
Hidden under the seat, stacked so careful and neat,
In the hope Murphy's Law won't apply.

But Murphy still lives, and he seldom forgives,
No matter how much you have pleaded.
The Rules make it plain, but we'll say it again:
Carry with you whatever is needed.
