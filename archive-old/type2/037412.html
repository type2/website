&lt;&lt;  put in a VDO tachometer and it works.I got a 74 2L carb.
 &gt;The only thing which needs some attention is that the rmp 
 &gt;vary a lot when driving at a constant speed. 
 
 Most VDO tachs that I've seen have dip switches on them to select for 4,6, 
or 8 
 cylinder installations.  I remember reading on the list a few months ago 
that 
 someone's brand-new VDO instructions were in error on the switch settings.  
So 
 you might want to contact VDO and make sure your switches are right.
  &gt;&gt;
Come to think of it my VDO tach has dip switches that have to be set for 4, 
6, or 8 cylinders and the directions they sent me were backwards.  It took me 
awhile to get it to register correctly.  Good suggestion to check the dip 
switches and possibly try diferent combinations.  My Vdo tach is steady.
