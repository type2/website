&gt;I staart my '69 bus (DP, 34PICT, 009, etc.) at 6:20 am.  Runs
&gt;like the proverbial crapola.  Won't idle if you touch the
&gt;pedal after you have set the choke.  Acts like this for the 1st
&gt;7-9 min of driving no matter the warm-up time. (Only under 55deg.
&gt;F air temp)  Stalls, hesitates, huge flat spots, etc.

I have the same setup, and mine does just the same thing. I'm 90% sure it's
because the engine is breathing cold air and it doesn't like it. The
problem is worse as the ambient air temperature is lower.

I'll bet you don't have the original air cleaner with the thermostat that
pulls air off the hot muffler when it needs to, right? That's what I'm
gonna do about it.

[Insert here nods and agreements over the 009 for those will instuct me in
its many evils. I know, I know, I know.]
