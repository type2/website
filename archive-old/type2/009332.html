You guys know there's no &quot;centrifugal force&quot; . . right ?

It's just &quot;momentum&quot; doing it's thing . . &quot;Newton&quot;

If you are in contact with your back-side soma, you have 
experienced &quot;Momentum&quot; . . you step on the gas you sink into the
seat . . you hit the brakes and it lifts you out of the seat. . 

Momentum . . 

We inherently know that the same is happening to the car . .
The &quot;weight&quot; shifts back to the rear wheels when you accelerate .

Shifts up to the front when you brake . . .

Brake &quot;bias&quot; is normally set for about 60% to the front . . YMMV

So we're going down the road a hundred miles an hour . . :-)

Now we turn the wheel . . &quot;hard a port, coxwain&quot; . .  :-)

The car stops going forward and starts trying to go sideways ..

You still have that &quot;momentum&quot; thing going tho, so even tho the 
car is making this turn you are &quot;Thrown&quot; to the side . .

Two things happened . . a braking action forward . . lifting you,
and your mass still wanted to go in the original direction . .
which is really only one thing . . :-)

When you go into a turn, that's what is happening to the car . .
The back end is coming up and losing traction and the mass of
the car would really prefer to keep going straight so the car
is rolling up on the inside . . .

Now let's say you did this turn bad . . :-) too fast . .

So you feel that weight shift too much . . you don't know how 
you know . . you just equate it to &quot;too fast&quot; . .

What happens if you touch the brakes?  (my favorite part) &quot;Doom&quot; !

The front that was doing alright anyway is getting more traction
and the back which had only the outside tire doing anything, 
suddenly gets lifted off the ground . .

We used to go out on this ice lake in the winter and do this 
with old clunkers . . it's a lot of fun under those conditions . . :-)

It is not fun when there is a sharp drop off the side which is the
most common around here . . well, it could still be fun for awhile . 

So you're eyeing your crucifix there on the mirror  . . small
version of your miserable life passing between . . 
it is &quot;Come to Jesus time&quot; . .  :-)

The &quot;proper&quot; response is forget the crucifix, grab a gear down
and accelerate rapidly . . often referred to as &quot;hammer the bitch&quot;
Make her scream . . .  :-)

This will pull the back down and you may just survive . .

If you don't can I have your spare case . . ? :-)

If you have two turns in a row tho, you're still frog soup, you
came out of the first so fast it throws you clear off the side
in the next turn . .  I was damn near killed . .:-)

Where I live we have lots of lovely turns like that in the hills
and mountains that compose most of the terrain . .

There is another rule . . if you went up that hill in second, you
come down that hill in second . .

The rule is for loaded trucks actually but you want to do different
and then have a deer step out in front of you, you will be wearing
antlers . .

If your engine is not in control of your car, you are out of control.

The above rule gets real important when there is any kind of &quot;slick&quot;.

Here's where you have the argument between &quot;brakes or bearings&quot; . .

I'm talking of do you brake to slow down or gear down and let
the engine take the load ?

Those people who argue for brakes shut up when the road gets slick.

What I'm saying here is that just like the first example, there
is a weight thing that needs those rear wheels in control at all 
times . . you will have better control and more traction.

So in this kind of terrain, I have gotten to where I just row thru
the gears and brakes are for correcting screw-ups . . maybe  :-)

This &quot;balance&quot; thing ie. &quot;front to back&quot; . . I've been talking more
of a Bug . . when you think about it tho, these items are more 
important in a van or westy . . .

Like all good things, there is a bad side . . if you decide to
try out these techniques . . get out alone and practice . .

As I said, Ice is neat for that kind of stuff where you don't 
fall off . .

I hit another car trying out a new trick too soon in traffic . .

In traffic, if you're surviving, don't change a thing . . :-)

So what happens when you pull her &quot;hard to port&quot; and pull the 
emergency brake . ?  :-)

What about loading . . ? yeah a question . . never thought about
it . .

 I think we all tend to load over the rear wheels for traction . .

 When I look at it from the perspective of my diatribe above tho,
I think it is probably better to distribute evenly front to rear .

 Unless you're a &quot;brake&quot; person . . :-)
