Subject: [T2] Vintage warehouse?

Hello,
 I was wondering what the reputation of Vintage Parts
In CA is. I have spoken through email and it was
always pleasnt. 
 I am trying to look at this from a buisness point of
view as my wife is eyeing a VW they have for sale And
I am eyeing some parts for several projects. I live on
the east coast and have to take them at their word.
Every thing on the web site looks clearly defined but
I have been misled before. Just trying to be
carefull.....  

Thanks-
 --Bryan
