Hello All:
I'm planning an extended trip for the month of July and I have
gotten the bus problems i was having solved.
(I need a new AFM, ouch! ;(   using a borrowed one for now)
My bus seems to be running as well if not better than ever.
(AVP 2.0 rebuilt, almost 2yrs old and ~10,000miles)

within the last 6 months installed new:
CV's and boots, new calipers/pads/rotors, new flex brake lines,
new shocks &amp; steering dampner, new shiftrod coupler, accel cable,
WR-1 hotstart relay, new fuel hose, filter and clamps, tranny fluid,
greased front axle, all fuses and bulbs, fanbelt, points/condensor,
rotor/cap/wires/plugs
when i bought engine 2yrs/10K miles ago:
new oil cooler, clutch-kit, alternator, thermostat, engine seal,
muffler, 185sr14/loadrange D 8ply tires, VWprogram HeatExchangerGiveAway ;).

probably forgetting some things as well....
I'm trying to do all that i can now to decrease the chances of
having problems on the road next month.....

I got oil temp&amp;pressure gauges/senders installed. I gathered 
up the parts to install an Aux. Battery, plan to get that taken
care of this week. Poptop scrubbed back to a color closer to white
than black/green/blue-funk. trying to decide if I should sand&amp;paint
it or just install the new seals and go with it.....

I thought it might not be a bad idea to improve/upgrade my
ignition system. A little better gas mileage on 6000+ mile
is a good thing. (ack! marthastewart...)

13: The Tiger 581 CDI ignition--the &quot;Baja&quot; waterproofed one
14: is $94.95 including shipping.  The un-waterproof one is very
15: slightly cheaper.
23: Universal Corporation
24: 730 Independent Avenue
25: Grand Junction, CO 81505

I couldn't convince the archives to spit out a phone # for Universal..
Anyone happen to have a contact #?

Also, I read that you have to assemble little adapter circuit for the
wire going to the FI ECU.
What is involved here? Can an averagejoe do it?

(2.0 FI engine, stock vacuum advance distributor and bosch blue coil)

compufire or pertronix points replacement:
I was surfing around the archives looking for infoz on these
two units. It seems that the Compufire and maybe the Pertronix?
both require you to cut/saw ~3mm off the bottom of your rotor.
is this the correct or did i misread those posts?
also, compufire makes two models: one for 009 &amp; one for vac.advance??
while the pertronix is one model fits all?
any one care to share their experience good or bad with either
of these? 
any thoughts? advice? suggestions?

thanks for all the help!!
Rob
'79 westy (will FINALLY go on vacation this summer! I spent the last two
summers with a bus in the process of getting roadworthy...)
