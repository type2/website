Subject:  ' 78 Camping Stool Dimensions?

I have been told that it is impossible to find a camping stool for sale 
anywhere in the Known Universe. Thusly, would someone who is in possesion of 
one of these suckers ( one from a ' 76-' 79 vintage ) please at least send me 
the spec.'s and I'll try my hand at banging one out in ye' olde wood shoppe. 
Thanks, Sionara
