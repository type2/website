I can reply to this one, because I have(well had, sold it, but still in my
garage) an SO-69 interior. I got it from a guy here in Washington out of his
1970 Westy. His bus was sold in Germany with this interior in it. It was owned
by an American that spent several years over there touring Europe. Upon return
to the US, they took the Camper with them. The Bus was a non-walkthrough. It
had the interior pictured in the first link. It had all European plugs, silver
socket and all. It was plumbed for &quot;camping gaz&quot; but is now set up for regular
US style propane. The Bus did not have the familiar Jalousie windows on the
sides, nor did it have the shelf over the bed. It did have a pop-top. Like I
said, I still have it in my Garage, but it was sold to another list member and
is just being stored for now. If anyone has anny questions, I may be able to
answer them, or even provide pictures. 
  I have only heard of about 4 of these in the US, there must be more, but they
are still very rare here. I do know of a guy that said he has the
stove/sink/fridge out of one, but have not seen it.

&gt; Below are two links
&gt; 
&gt; Link #1 is from the type2_dot_com library and is of a &quot;SO69 &quot; model 
&gt; Westfalia camper circa 1968 to 1971.
&gt; The pic is what seems to be referred to in Europe as the the Helsinki 
&gt; model. I have only seen one of these around the South Eastern US. and 
&gt; it is a 1969 model year bus. and a walkthru.
