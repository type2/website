&gt; has anyone else out there crank started a VW?  I am sure there is a lurking

&gt; earlier.  But there are those buses you all drove 10, 20 years ago, when
&gt; there were more on the road.  Any stories of a VW kicking back?

A friend of mine has a '63 single cab with a 1600 Dual Port engine. He found
the proper crankshaft nut and rear tin, and retrofitted a crank start. I too
had heard horror stories, but he has never had a problem, and it's really neat.
He said something about the shape of the slots makes it nearly impossible to
kick back, since they are angled, and will just slip past the bar.
I'm kinda looking for one myself...
