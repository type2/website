Subject: Re: [T2] wood working bus/westy owners...

I think you could use some sort of cable saw to saw along under the veneer 
with a slight pull to keep the cable working on the underside of the veneer 
and thus cutting the glue and not the wood.


&gt;I know this would be one hell of a feat---just grabbing the glued on
&gt;veneer---
&gt;
&gt;The glues that are used to stick this stuff on the composition board, is
&gt;almost bullet proof, and would be tough to lift just the veneer without
&gt;splitting or damaging it---
&gt;
&gt;I think almost impossible--unless you had a band saw with a large enough
&gt;throat to accept the door's---but even then, you'd need a huge fence,
&gt;darn near on both sides, to get a straight cut just below the veneer---
