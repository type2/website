In our small N.E. Pa. daily newspaper there appeared today this ad 
under Automobiles for Sale: &quot;1950 Volkswagon(sic) Van,ready to do over.
1 of first made by Volkswagon. Make offer.&quot;

I wasn't even aware type 2's were made back then let alone imported
to the U.S.

If anyone wants to check this out E-mail me and I'll forward the 
phone # in the ad. Intriguing as it is, I'm already overcommitted
automotively.
