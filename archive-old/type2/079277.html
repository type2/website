Subject: 71 Westy Luggage Rack Spacers

On the single/double cabs there is a rubber bumper that gets used in the =
tailgate. It measures 30mm x 40mm. I wonder if this would work as a =
replacement for the spacers that support the rear end of the luggage =
rack on my 71 Westy (between the metal roof and the fiberglass)?  Need a =
visual of the truck part, try looking at part number 261 829 577A at =
RMMW, they have a nice photo. If someone has tried this please let me =
know, if someone knows the dimensions of the original part I'd =
appreciate that too.
Anyone? Anyone?

Thanks,
Hal
