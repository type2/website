Subject: Head to Exhaust Ports

I will be attempting to lessen the exhaust leak I have around the heads
and the heater box steams, where the heater box mounts under the heads.
I was hopping someone could give me advice on what to do. A local
mechanic told me he usually globs some high temp rtv sealer around the
brass gaskets and smosh this up in the heads, not putting so much on
that it gets into the heater boxes. Any Ideas on this or other
suggestions are much appreciated.

I also have a leak of some sort between my transmission and the motor.
At first the fluid was real black, as if it was cleaning more of the
junk out of the bell housing that i missed when I cleaned it. It would
separate on the floor with the darker stuff in the middle and the fluid
surrounding that. I have never been able to detect if it's oil or Trans
fluid. I know trans fluid has its own smell, but I can't tell if it's
oil or trans fluid. If it is leaking between the two which one is it
most likely top be. It had a new rear seal as it was a new AVP Engine. I
did not replace my front trans seal.

And the final question: I also have a leak around my oil cooler, I did
not use any rtv sealer around the seals when I installed it, should I
use some this time or has someone got a better idea on how to seat them
properly. How much should these be torqued to?

As usual I appreciate the time and knowledge of those who can help.
