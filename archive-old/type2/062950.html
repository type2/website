&gt;Just because she can't drive or own one, doesn't mean she can't
&gt;start learning how to work on and understanding one.

Last summer I indoctrinated my 13 year old niece in the fine tradition of
backyard mechanics.  She helped me with some repairs on the bus and quickly
learned that I rely on the 10mm and 13mm wrenches a lot.  The next time she
saw me working on the bus she used this knowledge:  she snuck over and
removed these two wrenches from the bunch I had scattered around.  Since I
was unsuspecting and convinced I had misplaced a wrench, it took me a long
time to catch on (I guess a frantic, greasy guy rifling through a pile of
tools is funny to some people!!!! Grrrrr).

I'd say she learned what makes the bus AND me tick(ed)!!
