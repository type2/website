Subject: more turn signal wierdness

Ok- New development with the turn signal/battery light glitch...

When I am driving the bus, the battery light has a faint glow.

When I use the right turn signal or the brakes, the glow goes away.

When I use the left turn sugnal, the battery light glows like hell.

If left signal is on and brakes are depressed, light goes away.

Does anyone know where to start looking for a short?  I have tried
the turn signal switch, seems to be fine.

Also, when I got the bus the radio was installed with  the ground
attached to the hot wire from the dash lights.  I discovered this  
the first time I tried to use the radio and headlights 
simultaneously (Stupid, Spiteful PO).

Coincidence? I think not.

I hope I haven't fried my entire system.
