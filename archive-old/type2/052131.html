Subject: [T2] Bus handling (Was saggy rear end question)

Hi volks,

	Those who &quot;know&quot; me won't be surprised to find I have 
some knowledge of this...

 My experience pretty much ties in with Fred's: understeer is 
what you get unless you are pretty determined to get the back
end out. On dry tarmac a bus won't really slide (with all that
weight on the back wheels you get a LOT of grip). On ice or 
snow it will slide easily, of course, and you have to note
that the back end has more inertia than the front. On wet
roads things are more marginal.

 What usually happens is that the front starts to slip
as you wind on lock. If you stay with it then you'll run out
of road before the back end lets go. If you lift off then 
you'll get more grip at the front as weight transfers 
forwards, done nicely (ie early and not too hard) this will
tuck the front back in but if you overdo it the back end
will let go and try to swing round. In a bus you don't have
much power to transfer weight back again by accelerating so
if you're slow to catch on to what's happening it can be 
too late and you'll &quot;spin&quot;.

 Stock suspension is too soft to take much of this sort 
of abuse- a bus isn't stable enough or well enough damped
to be thrown around like a Porsche- so it's pretty likely
that at some point during the above shenanigans a stock
bus will fall over (which will hurt).

 I've driven '71, '68 and '77 busses which did this, and
I'm pretty sure that T25/vanagons are set up much the same,
despite the different front suspension.

Cheers,
	 W.
