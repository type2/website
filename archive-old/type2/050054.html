Subject: Re: [T2] Dealer Sticker Price for a 1979 Westy

Hi John---
    This isn't exactly what you asked for, but I have the sticker for my '77 
non-deluxe Westy, which might give you a ballpark idea. 

Make:  Volkswagen    Model:  2391    Year:  1977    Body Type:  Basic 
Campmobile

MSRP without accessories:                 $5,299.00
Campmobile equipment w/pop-up top:    2,150.00
Head restraints:                                        40.00
Long list of standard equipment:                    std.

Total outside California:                         7,574.00
California emission test:                             45.00

MSRP w/accessories at dealer:            $7,619.00

    So, how much extra was it to get that stool and little table, anyway?

Happy New Year, Matt Q. '77 Westfalia
