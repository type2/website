&gt; 
&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt;             I'm in the 300-mile break-in period on my AVP rebuild. It
&gt; seems pretty happy, but I'm getting a sound when I downshift, or even
&gt; when I let off the accellerator from a high RPM that was not there
&gt; before the rebuild. It sounds somewhat like &quot;
&gt; Flep.....flep,flep...flep&quot;. (Too bad I can't add a soundbite to this
&gt; post) Am i just being paranoid and is this normal on a rebuild, or does
&gt; it indicate a possible problem? I think I've heard it on older busses.

--&gt;  Kind of a sputtering or popping sound?  If so, check your exhaust
system for leaks.  This is pretty common...when you lift off the gas like
that, there's some unburned fuel that goes out the exhaust.  If it meets
the air while it's still hot (like through an exhaust leak) it'll explode
with a 'pop'.  Generally, the closer to the head the leak is, the more
likely this is to happen.  My '75 does it when the joints at the ends of
the headers leak.
