Subject: Re: [T2] Chrome plating plastic and middle seat questions

Shawn,

There are folks who do this out there....There was some discussion
on the vintag vw list about this some time ago, but I can't remember
where.

There should be some folks that do this around your area though.
I've beeen to a place that does this sort of thing and seen it done.

I don't think it is &quot;real&quot; chrome, but just looks really good!

Cheers ,dave

&gt; Well here goes, I have two questions for the list.
&gt; First does anyone know anything about chrome plating plastic, and if so a
&gt; supplier of this service?
&gt; 
&gt; Second I have a middle seat for my 63 DLX that has the plastic end and
&gt; center pieces for the grab bar. Well my center piece is broken and needs to
&gt; be replaced. I am looking to repop this part in chrome plated brass, what I
&gt; need is some one to loan/rent/sell me the middle piece and one end piece of
&gt; a deluxe seat to do this. I will then make a rubber mold of the parts and
&gt; return your original parts cleaned buffed and shined.
&gt; Also I will be happy to make more of these available for those that want
&gt; them.
