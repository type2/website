&gt; &gt;  Three shims are required to properly center the crankshaft
&gt; &gt;in the main bearing bores. Four shims is out of the range.
&gt;
&gt; So what would happen if I put in five shims ;-)  No, seriously.
&gt;
&gt; I understand the endplay is way out of spec but oil pressure seems good (no
&gt; light at idle, even when hot). Can I squeeze by reducing the endplay to .006
&gt; with five shims? Will I make things worse? If I can stop the leak she'll be
&gt; no worse off than she was. Believe me, I'd rebuild this thing if it were
&gt; mine. I just want to be sure I understand all the options.
&gt;

OK, then- You have more than 4 psi oil
pressure even when hot. And that's good ?!

More shims won't fix this problem.
You should be concerned with the #1 main
dowel pin hole. It was not designed
to accomodate your intended solution.

In addition, extra shims do not address
the loss of case clamping force, the crank will
&quot;whip&quot; and oval the case bores.
Bent / Broken crank? Seized bearings ? Rod failure ?

There is a good possibility this case can be
restored, but not for long. You are overdue.
