Subject: Shipping longblock via UPS (Beetlemex $980  1600cc DP longblock)
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I thought that most of the longblock assemblers had figured out a way to get
UPS to ship a longblock type1 engine.  Trucking to Seattle is $170, vs. the
150 lb maximum with UPS is more like $70.

Anyway, the guy at Beetlemex has been awesome to deal with, hope that UPS
works something out with him. This also factors into how much it costs to
ship back if the 6 month / unlimited mile warrenty comes into play.

Hello Stephen:

I have looked at UPS, and it does look very interesting. I will try to take
an engine tommorow to see what they say, because they are kinda fuzzy un
the packaging. If they accept it, it will surelly be a good way to send
them. I will let you know,

Thank You very much,

Miguel Padres

&gt;
&gt;UPS will ship a package of up to 150 lbs from your address to mine for only
&gt;$65 (uninsured).  Only a few more $ to have it insured for $980.  This is
&gt;almost 1/3 of what it costs to have it shipped via truck.

&gt;MAXIMUM PACKAGE LIMITATIONS
&gt;
&gt;The following size and weight limits apply to packages you send by UPS air
&gt;and ground services. 
&gt;  Up to 150 pounds. 
&gt;  Up to 130 inches in length and girth combined 
&gt;  Up to 108 inches in length. 
&gt;  
&gt;From what I understand, other VW suppliers are able to ship a longblock
&gt;engine via UPS.  Even if I paid you another $20 crate it differently, it
&gt;would still save almost $90!
