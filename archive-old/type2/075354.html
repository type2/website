Greetings List,
Here is the situation: Took the Bus (78) to get emissions today and the =
guy said he couldn't get it to high enough RPM's, it kept &quot;spurting&quot;. He =
says he thinks the fuel system is dirty and I should change the filter =
and add a fuel additive to clean it. So I begin to drive it home and it =
doesn't make it. It starts fine, and idles fine, but when i accelerate =
it lurches back and forth and sputters as if the fuel supply is being =
interrupted. Had to park it and walk home. What do you think the problem =
is? Note that this bus sat in a field for 5 years and I haven't done =
anything to the fuel system yet. I've driven about 70 miles since I got =
it and it ran fine until now.
Thanx in advance
Dan in Utah
