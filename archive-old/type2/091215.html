&gt; &gt; When you think about it, what extra electrical draw is
&gt; &gt; there in a bus that isn't there in a bug?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; A drained auxillary battery is probably the main difference ...

Buses were intended for heavier applications and expected to have more
electrical accessories added to them.  They were also intended to be used
for utility purposes which involve short trips and consequently more
starts per hour.

The best swap seems to be the bug alternator (internal regulator).
Lighter, simpler, and more amps.  Well worth the effort.
