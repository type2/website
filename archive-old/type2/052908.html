Subject: Stupid Me, dropped my spark plug

Hello Friends,

I dropped my #1 spark plug during removal.  It is somewhere in between the
cooling tin and the head somewhere.  What tricks have proven successful for
those of us who have also done this (I can't be the only one)?  I am
thinking of taking off all the cooling tin anyway and painting it, and
inspecting the heads, etc.

My ride is a 1972 station wagon, 7 seater.  All stock 67K original miles.  I
just bought is 2 weeks ago.  This past weekend I spent wrestling with the
rear brakes (those dad-burn adjusters were stuck, but I got them out).

Thanks,

reh
