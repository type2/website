Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch in my 79' Westy


&gt;Finding and removing the upper left bolt engine/trans bolt is bit of a
&gt;pain, but I've never had a problem with the starter bolt.  First, make
&gt;sure that the threads are clean, clean, clean and that the nut spins on
&gt;easily. Second, push it into place from underneath, then go on top and
&gt;hold it from pushing back thru with a small flat blade screwdriver while
&gt;you start the nut on it.

Getting the nut off is the easy part, although the screwdriver trick sounds 
pretty good -- wish I'd thought of that when I was replacing the starter on 
my '75! I replaced mine by myself on the side of a busy interstate in the 
dead of winter with semi's whooshing past at 70mph (I'm saving that story 
for a Friday!)


&gt;Last weekend I gained a whole new appreciation for the problems our
&gt;european brethren face, however.  Pat Flynn bought a euro-spec '75 double
&gt;cab with a 1600 DP motor in it.  No overhead access hatch and the upright
&gt;fan shroud.  What a pain getting the starter bolt off was!!!!  And I may
&gt;wind up gluing or duct taping the bolt to the starter as you suggest to
&gt;get it back in.  On a T4, that nut is right out in the open because the
&gt;fan shroud is not there, but it's gonna be unpleasant with the fan in the
&gt;way, I can tell :-)


Ouch! I thought that access hatch was standard for all late bays (US/Euro or 
otherwise). That would most definitely be a huge PIA.



&gt;I also finally &quot;got&quot; the urge to cut the rear cross member out, as we
&gt;jacked the tail of the bus to ridiculous heights to get the fan shroud
&gt;out.  I felt like I was bleeding a wasserboxer!!!  I had never understood
&gt;the urge to cut, as on a T4, it's &quot;lower the engine, slide it out&quot;.  At
&gt;worst, you have to take the bumper off for an extra 2-3&quot;.  On that silly
&gt;DC, you have to go up another 6&quot; and slide it out the rear wheel well!
&gt;Does removing the rear road wheel help, BTW?


I honestly couldn't tell you whether removing the wheel would be helpful. I 
never pulled the engine on my '75 w/T4, so I have no practical experience 
with that. However, I'm thinking that if you removed all the 
air-filter/heater-blower/pile-o-stuff that sits on top of the pancake, you 
may have an easier time pulling the motor out and getting it back in. If I 
remember correctly (it's been a while), most of that comes off in nearly one 
piece. With it all off (and possibly the rear bumper too), it might give you 
enough clearance to remove the engine without having to jack the bus up. But 
like I said, it's been a while and I'm sure I've killed those brain cells 
that remember any of it since.

All I can say is that I'm *really* pleased with the way my '70 is set up. 
The apron was easier to remove than any other part on my bus, and with it 
and the bumper off, the engine slid out with very little resistance.


Later,
