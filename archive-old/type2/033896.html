Oiled gauze air filters have a bit less restriction than paper filters,
but they also allow more fine dirt particles into your engine.

Racers like gauze filters because they will not clog up in heavy dust
conditions like paper filters will.  They keep out the big particles
that will destroy an engine right away.  They don't do much about the
smaller particles that an engine can tolerate in the short term. 
Racers do not care about long-term wear to their engines, since they
rebuild quite often.  This is a case of something that is great for
racing, but not all that good for regular street use.

Stick with the stock filter.  A lot of effort went into its design,
much more than any aftermarket alternative.
