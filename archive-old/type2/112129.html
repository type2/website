Subject: Sparkplug keeps blowing out

Ok, so I am fairly new to Type 2 ownership.  I have a 1975 Westfalia with an rebuilt stock engine, 1600 miles on rebuild.  In the last 500 or so miles I have driven it, twice now the #3 spark plug has blown out of its socket while driving (actually its happened in the exact same place both times, at the bottom of a hill while using 2nd to slow the vehicle).  I have read Muir's take on a stipped plug hole, and it just does not feel stripped when I put the plug back in.  I am wondering if any one else has had this problem and what the cause turned out to be.  Since the plug hole does not feel stripped I am hesitant to take out the motor to check its integrity without more info.  Just looking for some advice or ideas before I take the motor out.  Anyone have a plug hole retreaded?  Thanks.
