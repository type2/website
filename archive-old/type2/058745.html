Subject: RE: Performance calculations

&gt;  Perhaps you're a bit of a loon- you want to be able to keep up with the
&gt; big boys in the outside lane and still have enough in reserve to hold that
&gt; sort of speed up a steep highway (Well, they're going to be a bit upset at
&gt; having been passed by a bus- you don't want them to catch you at the next
&gt; climb do you?). You might be looking for 125-130bhp: Porsche/Chevy V6
&gt; territory.
&gt; 
&gt;   How about if you often drive a full load (dog, surfboard, six weeks
&gt; food and water plus half a ton of spares &amp; tools?) but want to be able to 
&gt; embarrass the BMW drivers as you cross the Rockies. In that case you
&gt; either
&gt; need 180bhp (that's a 3.0l 911SC, BTW) and a serious brake upgrade or,
&gt; more
&gt; likely, to have a quiet chat with these nice gentlemen over here in the
&gt; long white coats...
&gt;  
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;         W.

	Call the guys in white coats??? 

	Had to reply to this one due to the first hand experience.  First
some background.   The Bus is a 75 Camper with all the gear, 3 way fridge,
full cupboard setup, Gas cooktop and griller, bed/backseat and poptop.

	The Bus is now running a 230hp Alloy V8 engine (Alloy due to the
weight).   The brakes are standard but carefully rebuilt and its running
swaybars front and back along with Koni shock absorbers.  The tires are
235/75/15 on the rear and 205/75/15 on the front in a LT format.

	I find that brakes aren't that big a deal, after all if you dont go
100mph then you don't have to stop from 100mph.  The Bus can actually pull
just over 200kmh, about 120mph I think.  But it's a white knuckle ride and
was a once off!!! oh and has custom ratios in the transaxle geared to the
ideal engine revs and peak torque etc to enable it to do this.  It'll easily
cruise at 70mph on about 2200revs though no overheating, no nothing, not
even in a hot Aussie Summer.

	With this combination the Bus is powerfull, has no problems with
hills and can even overtake up them with ease.  It's also a real good laugh
when you blast past some family wagon or out drag some late model plastic
car at the traffic lights with the front scrabbling for road and the back
squatted right down!! 

	Hmmm, on second thoughts, call the guys in the white coats, this
power thing has defiantly got me.
