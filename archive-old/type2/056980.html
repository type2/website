Beary, my 75 bus, will roll over 100,000 miles on the way to the Central
Ohio VW club's show this weekend. In his honor and for many miles of trouble
free service, I am throwing him a party complete with a cake at the show
Saturday. This is an open invitation to any and all who attend the show to
stop by and have some cake and help Beary celebrate. We'll be there Friday
night. TBear
