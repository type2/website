Subject: Beetle Mania

The National Auto Museum (formerly Harrah's) in Reno is doing an exhibit
this summer called Beetle Mania. We're leaving today to take our Type 3
Karmann Ghia to be in the exhibit. We plan to really enjoy the drive
up there by taking the back roads since my motto, as proclaimed by a
window sticker, is &quot;Trailers are for boats.&quot; Hey, its a 'Bug' show so I
figure its all right to show up with a few bugs on the front. To round out
this relaxed weekend we're going to take the train back home. And, during
the long summer months without the car we'll just have to satisfy
ourselves with camping in the Adventurewagen. Such is life.

If any of you are heading through there between May 12 and Sept 27 I
encourage you to check it out. There will also be a Type 1 Ghia and a
split window Bus there in addition to the Beetles. Check out their web
site at http://www.automuseum_dot_org to see some of the other cool cars in
their collection.
