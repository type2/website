&gt;Hi Karl,

Mike &amp; List, While I don't want to associate myself w/ the rude tone of Karl's post, he does make an interesting point.  I am curious about total advance on a 71 bus dist.  What I understand is:
	1.	vac retard is based on manifold vac. (under butterfly) which does fall to 0 under accelleration.
	2.	centrifugal advance is, of course, unrelated to vacuum
	3.	vac. advance is connected to carb vacuum (above butterfly) which increases w/ velocity through the carb.
While I have read in many sources that vac. advance drops out at wide open throttle (WOT), I can't understand why.  It seems to me that vacuum to the vac. advance mechanism should peak at WOT.  I have verified that as I increase RPMs, advance port vacuum increases as follows:
	RPM		mm Hg Vacuum
	800		0
	1000		50
	1200		90
	1500		120
	2500		215
	3000		280
	3000		480
This test was performed w/ the car in neutral while I was behind the car manually pulling the throttle open w/ a vacuum gauge &quot;T'd&quot; into the vacuum advance line.  I have a 1970 van w/ a basic 1971 van type engine (1600dp, dist. rblt to match 211-905-205Q dist (stock 1971), 34Pict3 carb).  When I manually pull the throttle open, I get appx. 38 deg BTDC max advance (using degree marks which I measured and filed onto the rim of a stock pulley).  I verified TDC using the positive stop method.  If you have any thoughts on this, I'd be very interested.  Thanks for your interesting and helpful posts!
