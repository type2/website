Subject: fuel pump relay - 

I think I found my problem - I had the fuel pump relay connected backwards.  I disconnected it, and the voltage dropped from the fuel pump.  I then connected it the right way.  No voltage.  Looking good.  Then I put the key in the ignition.  Still no voltage.  Not looking so good.  
 
Did I fry the relay by connecting it backwards?
 
Thanks - 
 
Marc
