Subject: [T2] 68-73 Westies

		I have been doing a little looking around at the different
Westies built from 68-73. I have noted several differences and was wondering
about them and what ever I have not noted.
		What year did they start installing the rear shelf above the
bed? I have seen a 69 and a 70 without it, my 71 has it, so 71?
		The side cabinet at the front is held in by latches up to
70? The 69 has the latches and my 71 has screws as well as the 72 and 73 I
have looked at.
		The bed has a different hinge assembly. The 69 I saw had two
straight bars that hook into some slots and hold up the seat to get into the
storage area. It also uses these as a hinge point. My 71 and 73 are
different. The hinge has extra bars that &quot;lever&quot; it into position. (hard to
describe).
		The wood grain changed in 72 to a different type of wood
pattern, straighter, not a burl look. The handles also changed to a
cream/Ivory not the dark gray of the 68-71. The inner latch also changed
from a metal to a plastic part. 
		The Jump seat has a pocket in the top, some had an oval
cutout and others were just open with no top. 
		68-72 were mustard vinyl, the 73 had mustard cloth(feels
like burlap)
		73 has a different upper cot than the 68-72, it is on the
opposite side of the Bus. This is due to there not being a sunroof pocket
any longer. The hole is the same size, but the pocket is not there. This
also means that the upper shelf is different for all 3 years from 71-72. 71
is old wood grain, 72 is new wood grain but still shorter due to the sunroof
pocket, and 73 is new wood grain, but taller due to no sunroof pocket. 
		There is a slight difference in the water tanks also, but it
is only where the hose for the faucet enters. One enters right through the
top of the tank, the other has a fitting at the bottom. These are
interchangeable. 
		If you know of any thing I have missed, please post it, I
would like to make a good list of changes for people looking for parts. That
way you can get the right stuff for you Westy. I plan to take pictures of
most of the stuff and put it on my web site.
