Subject: Battery sale

X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

I was at West Marine yesterday looking for some electrical bits for our '70
Campmobile and discovered they currently have a battery sale going on.

The Grp. 24 were priced ~$50.00, and were heavy duty marine combination
starting/&quot;light deep cycle&quot; units.  They have combination post and wing-nut
terminals.

Before the flames and rants begin, I've run similar Grp. 24 and Grp. 27
batteries in both marine and automotive applications for years and have had
excellent results.

In air-cooled VW applications any Grp. 24 battery has a reserve capacity far
in excess of the needs of the starting system.  One of these combination
units would be ideal for any Type 2, especially a camper.

FWIW.....
