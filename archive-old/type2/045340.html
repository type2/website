Subject: Re: [T2] '73 fuel tank venting

I think you will find that you need the FI tank, which is different than
the tank for carbureted engines. The problem is that there is a return line
to the FI (as you study the FI system, you'll find what they call a &quot;fuel
ring&quot; that goes around to each of the injectors). Rather than forcing fuel
in with the air mixture, as carburetors do, FI systems supply a constant
pressure (30+psi) of fuel to each of the injectors and the injectors open
for very brief intervals (pulses) to inject a precise amount of fuel into
the air stream. The fuel-air mixture actually occurs closer to the cylinder
in FI systems than in carbureted systems.

Back to your problem, although you can in theory drill a tank and put a
return line into it, in practice, this is a dangerous or difficult
proposition. To be safe, it's tricky. To be quick, it's VERY dangerous. In
my research, I found that most places that do welding and such won't work
on fuel tanks that have ever had fuel in them. Some tanks have been known
to develop pockets of fuel (perhaps between a sealant in the inside of a
tank) and they become waiting time bombs when you work on them dry. For
that reason, you basically should fill the tank with water or some othe
non-flammible liquid when you drill it. I'd also be concerned about getting
a good seal on the tank when I added the other receptacle. There are those
on the list who argue that this concern is over-cautious, but I think the
majority of experienced people will agree with this warning.

I picked up a nice clean FI tank from a '75 bus for about $40 at a local
shop. I cleaned it up and haven't had problems with it. I installed this in
a '72 and the venting was pretty similar. I don't recall anything I had to
change, but if I did, it wasn't rocket science, so you should be okay.

As for your options, fresh rebuilds can be expensive propositions too. If
you get charged for a new engine, you might be surprised to find that it
wasn't done right. You end up with too much money into something that needs
to be rebuilt again. It can go the other way too. You need to do your
homework here and ask questions...and use your best judgement.

A '79 engine with '79 heads is an expensive engine when it comes to
exhaust. If you don't have all the exhaust components intact in good
condition, you could be looking at well over $1000 for exhaust alone and
some of the parts are NLA (no longer available), except from
junkyards...and usually not in great condition.

Good luck! Joe


&gt;Does a 73 have the same venting for the tank as a '72?
&gt; You all confirmed my thoughts that the bus originally
&gt;came with a type IV, but carbureted.  I'm looking into
&gt;purchasing a '73 with no engine, but the owner is
&gt;giving me the option to purchase a fresh Type IV FI
&gt;engine with the bus.  Other than the additional return
&gt;vent, do the gas tanks differ at all?  The engine is a
&gt;'79 FI.  Just wondering what my options are for the
&gt;gas tank.  Right now, I see three options: Leave it in
&gt;cuz they're the same, plug up the charcoal vent and
&gt;drill and install a vent for the FI setup, or replace
&gt;tank entirely with one out of the right era (what is
&gt;that, '75-'79?)
