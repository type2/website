&lt;&lt; just purchased a '72 Bus or should I say stoled. My question is has anyone
 here blasted the exterior panels- if so- did you experience any warping
                                                      Any replies will be much
 appreciated,

  You want to save the sandblasting for the panels that are all ready warped
--dents and dings.  Sandblasting is okay as long as your going to do repair
work in that area.  But for non-dented areas that are nice and straight
plastic media blasting is the way to go.  The plastic doesn't remove metal and
create heat like sandblasting.  
   I question everybody's desire to have there buses down to bare metal.  At
work (I'm a bodyman) we do everything we can to save as much of the factory
corrosion protection as possible.  Even in the 1990's we still can't duplicate
the factory corrosion protection of a 30 year old VW.  We can come close, but
nothing beats the factory stuff.  I myself prefer to sandblast damaged areas,
then Variprime them and hit the rest of the sound paint with a DA (Dual Action
Sander).   Prime the bus with a good sandable epoxy primer, guide coat it and
then countless hours of blocking it out (this is where you and your bus really
start to bond--think happy thoughts)
  Peace, Love, and thoughts of climbing mountains and camping by streams,

PS Things have been hot and heavy with posts of stolen buses, hence you may
get some strange feedback about your post.  From now on you may want to just
say you got one hell of a deal!  LOL
