Subject: Re: Deep Cycle Marine Batteries??

K-Mart and Walmart sell deepcycle Marine batteries. Sears does too.  Marine 
stores will have them, but at greater cost.  Don't waste a lot of money going 
for the biggest or the best. In addition to my bus, I have a sailboat, and 
the costliest part of it has been the mucho expensivo Marine batteries that 
don't last as long as the cheap car batteries I've  replaced  them with.If 
you decide you  wanna go real high tech, you can consider gel-cel or glass 
matt batteries, but expect to pay BIG dollars.But they are supposed to be 
long lived, and dependable. tHowever, that money might be better spent on 
solar panels for your roof... any Marine catalog would have them. West 
Marine, BoatUS, Defender...
As for the battery tray area, when I bought my 76, the tray area was just 
about gone. 
I cleaned it with a hose, used spray undercoating inside and out, and screwed 
in a piece of plywood, [screw from the underside, up into the ply]  then 
sprayed again. Twelve years and counting....no probs.  Next time thru the 
paint shop, tho, I'm gonna get it fixed proper. I use a small piece of ply 
about the size of a cracker secured with a small sheetrock screw as a 
hold-down on the battery foot.
That's my Mumble Opinion...
