Nice page, JW.  

&gt;From the data (5.5&quot;, 39mm offset) and (6.0&quot;, 30mm offset), it would seem
that most of the additional rim width goes outboard. More precisely, if my
math is correct, of the additional 13mm, 15 are added outboards and 2 are
substracted from the inside.

I also vaguely remember reading about 7.0&quot; rims for the vanagon and I
*believe* the offset was 23mm. Compared to the 5.5&quot; rims, this implies an
additional rim width of 38mm, 35 of which are added outboards and 3 of which
are added &quot;inboards&quot;.

Hence it would seem to me that the &quot;correct offset&quot; is simply more of
function of what _fits_ in the wheel wells, rather than being a function of
what is &quot;right&quot; for the bearings. Comments?
