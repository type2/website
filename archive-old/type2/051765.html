Subject: [T2] Learning to drive in a bus.

Hi,
	I learned to drive in a bus, albeit one that was 
pretty new at the time, rather than 20 years old. IMHO it's
easier than most other manual transmission cars because the
visibility is so much better.

 I think the point about the location of the front wheels is
misplaced- it's only an issue if you have to unlearn how to
drive a car with the wheels out front. If a bus is your first
drive then you don't need to adapt.

 My advice would be to get (at least a little) professional
instruction from an instructor who is comfortable in a
manual car. This avoids a lot of stress that arises when 
trying to teach or learn from someone you know and also
stops an amateur instructor from passing on bad habits.

 Which brings me onto hill starts! Using the handbrake for 
setting off is NOT cheating!!!! It's the correct way to do
it. You should never ride the clutch when stationary to
hold position and trying to do some fancy footwork to
avoid putting it on when setting off is just daft.
 All European drivers do this (well, maybe not the 
Italians... :-). It's what VW intended- that's why the
handbrake is so close to the gearlever. It is good, safe
practice. If your handbrake won't hold on a hill then
it's broken and needs fixing. Incidentally- we have an
annual inspection in the UK (the &quot;MoT&quot; test), if your
handbrake isn't effective the car will fail this test
and you arn't allowed to drive it until it's fixed.

Cheers,
	 W.
