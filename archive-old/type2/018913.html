	a few days ago my 72 westy wasent idleing at all so i brought out the
good old dwell tach, the dwell was at 30 degrese, and i thought i just
set it... so i opened up the distributer, and reset the points, the gap
was way to big (probably dident tighten the screw enough) put it all
back together and............nothing. dident even sound like it wanted
to kick over, checked for spark, fine...... i got frustrated and did it
all again, same..... so i got very frustrated and decided to call it a
day, right now im thinking (hopeing) i put the distributer cap on
backwards... i know there's a clip or what ever you call it to prevent
that but i remember it being an awofully tight fit the last time i did
the points. so tomarow im thinking im going to check the fireing order,
yeah yeah i know 1-4-3-2 by heart, thats what stoped it from running
last time.. anyway, tomarow i'll check to make sure i dident connect the
1 4 3 2 backwards... i'll probbably send another e-mail titled &quot;im an
idiot&quot; then. but worst case, anyone have any suggestions?

p.s. is it right to ask your bus if it knows the meaning of &quot;parting
out&quot; or do you have to encourage them?
