I had a set of those hemispherical seals.  They fit the front two holes
(1&amp;3) with a little coaxing but would not fit the back two holes due to the
curvature of the tin.  I finally abandoned them in favor of the flimsy ones
- the last set of which I got have remained supple for several years now
and seal pretty darned well.  Don't remember where I got them though.
