Subject: Re: [T2] Cleaning up a Shappire

John Hartranft sends:

&gt; The Sapphire XIV in my bus has a slide switch above the preset buttons that
&gt; toggles you between AM and FM.  It's gotten dirty, I guess, and vibration
&gt; and bad looks will provoke it to wander between the two, leaving much static
&gt; in it's wake.  Also, when it's in radio Twilight Zone, the volume drops
&gt; dramatically, but not entirely.  Makes it exciting when it vibrates back to
&gt; one band or the other.
&gt; 
&gt; What's the best stuff to clean things up?  Acetone?  Is that vinyl friendly?
&gt; Sources?

No acetone. WD-40 on a Q-tip. It'll fix you right up.
