Subject: Re:46 Bug..where is the oldest bus?

Dave Eccles rote:

&gt;Willi Lotterman in Germany has a real old bug
&gt;So...where in the world is the oldest surviving still functioning privately
&gt;owned Bus..anyone wanna nominate something for starters?

Willi Lotterman's 1950 panelvan I think. I hear he also owns the second
oldest Type 2, but it's in need of resto. The VW museum in Wolfsburg has a
1949 prototype panelvan.

BTW, the oldest Beetle at Bad Camberg was a 1943 military spec bug, on a
Kubel chassis. It was restored to better than new &lt;drool&gt;
