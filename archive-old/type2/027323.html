I had mine rebuilt, its purpose is not just to keep pollution down. A 
knowledgeable source explained it to me in a nutshell...

in between full throttle and idle the valve is open letting in inert gases 
collected from the exhaust. These gases help keep the &quot;burnable&quot; (normal air 
entering via airfilter) gases displaced in the cylinder and thus the engine 
temp down.

&gt;  Hi Listees,
&gt;How do you fel about EGR Valves?
&gt;Do you secretly disable them because they make your engine run rough?
