Subject: Wiper Juice Tube Attachment, Day 2.


Hey,

Question:
What can be used to attach the wiper juice tube to the small plastic
piece inside the steering column?  (ie: small metal attachment, wire
wrapped around, or something - as long as it fits inside when I close
the casing)

FYI -
I managed to get the juice squiting a few times - so at least I know it
works, but after a bit more water poured out the steering column.  A
setback, but I think I know why...

Actually, I think there are 2 problems:

(1) There was a cracked tube in the steering column, caused by wear
against the metal casing, perhaps incorrectly mounted at one time.  I
cut off 1 inch and re-attached it, at which time it worked a bit then
leaked due to nothing really glueing the tube on to the column (ie:
attachment)
(2) There appears to be a leak on the small valve which I use to put air
in the blue juice tank.  It may be rusted or some kind of small fault.
I placed a plastic cap on for now, hoping this will hold the air for a
little bit .  I will look for something at Canadian Tire tomorrow that
will fit inside the rubber hose, hopefully it will be available.

So once I get I just need a recommendation of what will fit over the
tube to help secure it, that won't block access to closing the casing.

Thanks for all the help!
