&gt; For some reason, all my posts to the list from this addy always bounce, but if you would be so inclined to pass the

&gt; Imperial Valley areas on I-8 to Yuma and AZ-95, I'd be obliged...  FWIW we'll be using the FRS's set to channel 2 and
&gt; I'm &quot;thimking&quot; to leave Heber (just south of I-8) around 9-ish on Friday morning and get to Havasu by noonish...
