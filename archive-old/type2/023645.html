Volks, especially the west coast side of the USA.  Got a call from Bob 
Perring this afternoon, giving me an update on his and Mary Beth's travels.  
They were at Lake Tahoe, with the back of Casper in Nevada and the front in 
California.  They head out tomorrow for Yosemite and a couple of days of 
adventure before getting into California full time.

They had snow overnite on the rim of the Grand Canyon a few days back, after 
previous days of over a hundred degrees.  They traveled a bit with a German 
couple, and met a Park Ranger that was just starting his job.  On his day 
off, he came back in his bus and brought a bottle of wine and they had a 
great time of socializing and bus talking.

Bob is working on his dizzy tonight to  get it fine tuned... the one 
currently in Casper is doing okay ( it is the '68 Autostick bug one that we 
asked about a while back)... but he is getting a bit of pinging on hills (3-4 
thousand footers, in third gear) so wants to go back to his original dizzy.

His email is limited to public library time, where he must do things 
real-time and is limited... so email to him must be very short, but he did 
get the info about the dizzy.

He and Mary Beth are having a blast, going where the wind blows... and I am 
jealous as all heck.... let me pack my bus and hit the open road.  If he 
calls and wants to tip a cool brew and talk busses, grab the chance and you 
will have a great time.

PS.  Fred, Bob tried to call today a couple of times, but he is having 
problems with his Sprint connections... but will try again in a few.  And 
thanks for the concern on their home.
