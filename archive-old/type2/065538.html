Subject: Locknut torque values

 I suppose this stuff never happens to you guys. . . . . .

 I asked for a hardware kit, all the little nuts in one pack.

 What I got was a pack of the nylon insert nuts for every thing
except the head nuts.

 The question: I used to have a book that indicated the different
torque values for various conditions. The torque on a lubricated 
nut, for instance would be lower than the dry, etc.

 The torque for Nylocks was another. Maybe 25% higher.

 So I'm looking for these specs.

 I don't mind using these nylocks but they are going to need diff. 
torque values.

 So - - - - - has anyone got said spec sheet and would you please 
throw it out here?

 Just got my case together with all the little gee-whizzes in it and 
it looks just too fine to believe.

 Time to start on my heads and mount the jugs for preliminary pre-
fit. 

 Shouldn't have the case apart more'n six more times!    west
