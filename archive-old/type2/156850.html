Subject: Position of distributor

HEY ALL
 
I have a very stupid and confusing question. I am trying to get all my VW's back to vacuum advance distributors and
I am a little confused on where the position of the darn thing should be. Most everything that i read says that the distributor
should be postitioned with the mark, on the ring that the cap sits on, at the four oclock postion, thus the number one plug wire 
at this position when the cap is on. But since im putting in these vacuum advance distributors on all of them the mark on the rim
of the distributor is more at  the ONE o clock position....sort of pointing toward the #1 cylinder and plug and the number
one wire at this position also. Now they all run great with 
it set here and it is more less in time.........Runs great........but my question is is this wrong??
thanks all.
Rus
