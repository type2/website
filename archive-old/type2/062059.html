Subject: Cleaning Westy Top

Greetings VW lovers,

        I recently saved a 72 Westy from rotting underneath a tree, it has all
original westy interior and a good solid body (It was under the tree
because the pancake dropped a valve, still working on that)
        Because it was under the tree the pop-top has black gunk inbeded
into the fiberglass fibers, now the top is off but still has the canvas
attached to it, and will be using the canvas.  I already took the
luggage rack off a scrubbed it with bleach and it came pretty white.
        Now the questions:

    1. What should I clean the top with?
    2. Can I use some sandpaper to take black stuff off (220grit-wet?)
    3. If I sand it down should I put something on the top later, like
       fiberglass paint or some kind of wax
    4. What do I use to clean the canvas and will it be safe keeping it 
       attached to the top or should I take it off.
    5. Where is the best place to get a seal for the top

Thanks Tim Watson
