Subject: Depot Hack: Low-Rent Pop-Top Rehab

At first it was going to be a bull with only two horns:

(1) Remove canvas so the Cruise Director could sew in new screens, which
had disintegrated, then re-install; and

(2) Install new pop-top seal.

But it turns out that the tent is remarkably difficult to remove with the
top still on, and we suspicioned that it was very easy with the top on the
ground, so we added:

(3) Remove three-quarter top.

Accordingly we removed the several thousand tiny little screws that hold
the bottom of the canvas in and unbolted what's holding the top on, which
is not much--namely four nuts at the front hinges and two nuts at the rear
braces. Slid the top backwards and lifted it down, the Cruise Director and
I. Marry you a *strong* woman, boys, that's the way to do it. ;)

The canvas was indeed easy to remove with the top laying there like a
rowboat. Remove the hold-downs. Gouge out the several thousand little
staples and finish them off with needlenose.

Upon examination the canvas itself turned out to be pretty crispy. Don't
want to do this twice. My supremely excellent wife says she can sew that
tent easy, just need some yards of nylon, no problem. Alright, now we have

(4) Fabricate entire tent.

She has the old one to use as a pattern. Good thing, because $250 for a
store-bought one is completely hypothetical right now...

On to the new rubber seal. This was $65 at BusBoys, it's wonderfuly squishy
and I can't wait to get it on. But, it turns out that this seal is
&quot;shorter&quot; than the old one, it doesn't &quot;grab&quot; the edge of the pop-top as
far as the old one did. That might not be a problem except that some PO
painted the poptop white over its original beige, so I'm gonna have a
stripe of beige and twenty-year muck all around above the new seal. Right,
then,

(5) Sand and paint pop-top.

This was accomplished with the aid of my capable daughters, Boy (6) and
Cheetah (5). Fine sanders, they. When they got bored I feathered the edges
of the painted surface and set to it with the RustOleum. A color I call
Washing Machine White. My bumpers are the same color. You can see us from a
long way off. It flowed out half decent, I'm pretty good with spray paint,
the result of having apprenticed with a cabinet maker and learning to get
good results with a cheap paint gun.

Tonight, on with the seal. You clang it on with a rubber mallet, it was
easy. The new seal is as black as it can be. We ain't got money but by God
we have *contrast*.

Tomorrow, silicone the seal and re-install the top. The tent isn't done
yet, the top will have to come off a second time to re-install it. Boy and
Cheetah simply cannot see going to all that extra trouble when we *could*
drive around with nothing up there but the bunk, and them on it. I will at
least take them around the block and let them poke their heads out the top.
