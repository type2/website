Subject: Re: [T2] Towed Home today, pully fell off.... Why???

I don't understand why the pulleys come off if they
are put on right, I have been working on VW's for 30+
years and have never had one come loose. Clean the
crankshaft end up, (threads inside)clean the bolt, put
some locktight on the threads. lock the flywheel, put
the pulley on the flywheel, install the bolt with the
flex washer and torque it down, use a torque wrench
set to the torque in the Bentley book. good luck with
the next one. Phil
