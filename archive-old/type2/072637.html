Subject: petronix circuit detail

This afternoon I was sorting out the new wiring needed to install both a CD
and a Petronix in conjunction with my 009. I find that I doin't understand
a detail of the Petronix.

I assume that , as was the case with the stock points, the function of the
Petronix is to interrupt the ground to the coil secondary winding as the
distributor shaft rotates. For the stock points, one side of the points is
obviously grounded because it is attached to the grounded base plate. For
the Petronix, the situation is not so clear.

Can I assume that the circular base plate which comes with the Petronix
provides this ground? No wires are visible emerging from that little
module.  There is one curious step in the Petronix installation
instructions to the effect that &quot;if a ground wire was present in the
distributor then it should be reattached&quot;. No such ground wire was present
in the 009.

Thanks, Jack
