Subject: Re: Low Rumble in 71 1600

Its not the heads. Something is out of balance.  Generator pulley is 
probably off-center or one of the washers is - or there's something stuck in 
the fan (mechanic dropped his tire pressure guage back there or something) 
throwing it off balance.

Only thing he changed was the genereator, right?  Didn't have the vibe 
before, right?  They are related.

He replaced the
&gt;pulley(cover that
&gt;goes over the shims) put on a new belt and new generator.
&gt;
&gt;Anyhow drives real nice.  Now when it starts up there is a low rumble that
&gt;was not there before.  Idles alright it but the rumble quiets down after it
&gt;warms up.
