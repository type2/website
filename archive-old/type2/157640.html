Subject: Re: [T2] Tire Chains How-To

That's great, Bussy.  Thanks!  Haven't seen them with a rubber tensioner before.  But then I haven't seen a set put on since I was a kid.  That's been a while.  I may need a set before winter's over.   Cheers...KR

putting on *conventional* tire chains. This is the
method I used when chaining fleets of buses - quick,
reliable &amp; easy. My album is not yet complete (will
any ever be?) but all the meat &amp; potatoes are there!
