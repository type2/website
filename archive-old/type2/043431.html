Subject: Re: Fuel Filler Necks are Back!

&gt;&gt; Why do bus fuel filler necks cost $40.00, when they are essentially a 
&gt;&gt; short section of radiator hose that I can buy at any FLAP for less than 
&gt;&gt; ten bucks??

&gt;Nope, they are made of different material.  Gasoline will attack radiator
&gt;hose, rendering them dangerously brittle in a few months.George Lyle

I don't know about brittle, but radiator hose definitely doesn't like gas!  I 
used radiator hose for the tubes that connect the center section to the intake 
manifolds on a bug several years ago and within a few weeks, the hose had 
shrunk in diameter quite a bit in the short length between the metal parts.  I 
sold the bug shortly thereafter so don't know if they kept shrinking or not.
