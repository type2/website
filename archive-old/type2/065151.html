Subject: Re: Creaks and Groans - Front end

I would definitly (sp?) install a new set of shocks and check your 
brake linings.
      My type 1 made the same &quot;crunch&quot; noise untill the rear shocks were
replaced...easy to do!
      The front end doesn't even hardly move {bounce}, so i'm thinking 
they should be replaced too&gt;     Peace Phil
