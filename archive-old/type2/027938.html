&gt;From where I'm sitting, there are two major issues in doing a partial rebuild:

- unknown wear
- balance

I was afraid to split the case on my first 'rebuild'. It lasted less than 1,000 miles. Another engine I did a top-end only on gave me better results, but I attribute that to luck...and some knowledge of the past rebuilder's skill and motivation contributed to the decision to do a top-end only on that.

Since then, I've decided that the small amount of additional work required to inspect the bottom end is well worth the peace of mind...even if you decide not to correct questionable tolerances. This is your chance to check bearing wear, cam wear, lifter wear, etc. Figure 2 more days in the process to split the case and inspect everything. 

Every time I've split a case, I've found some condition that needed attention. Cam, crank, and rod bearings will run about $70. If they need replacement, you'll gladly spend the money and pat yourself on the back for splitting the case.

Balance: if you're adding p's &amp; c's, you want to match the weights of each piston and its connecting rod to the other pistons and connecting rod sets. My philosophy is different if I'm just re-ringing. I'll use the same p's &amp; c's in the same positions on a previously balanced engine...but the rods go back in the same places too...and I have to know the engine was previously balanced (an original VW engine being rebuilt for the first time, or an engine I built or an engine built by someone whose work habits I know). Still, there's risk associated with the assumption that a previous state of balance has been maintained.

So, I vote &quot;no&quot; on engines of unknown providence, but like Bob Hoover used to tell me all the time, &quot;you're the HMIC (Head Mechanic in Charge).&quot; Ultimately you'll be the one paying the price in time to split the case and money to fix what you find; you'll also be the one cruising happy or thumbing bummed if something goes wrong.

Have fun! Joe
