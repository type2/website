Subject: [T2] 75 Sputter, Spitter, backfire! And new bug

Happy Wednesday Y'all!
My 1975 Riviera camper runs GREAT!  Except when it is damp and moderately cold outside as it was this morning (40 degrees and foggy in Cincinnati). Under these conditions, It will not
hold an idle.  Runs fine as long as my foot stays on the accelerator, but as soon as I stop giving gas, it stalls.  It starts right up again after this.  Also, when I engine brake by down-shifting, it sputters, spits and backfires, sounds like someone put a popcorn popper in my engine compartment (every time it backfires, my 2 year old son exclaims WOOHOO!!  Which is pretty cute, but I would rather my bus run smoothly).  It seems to do these things in temperatures between 30 and 40 degrees.  Any warmer or colder than this and it doesn't seem to be a problem.  Any body have a clue for me???  I'm guessing that I'm getting moisture somewhere, but where??
By the way I'd like to announce a new addition to my air-cooled family, I finally talked my wife into getting a bug, so for Valentines Day we got her a 1971 Super Beetle with only 60,000 original miles, sweet find!!  So is there the Type 1 equivilent of this Type 2 list where I can get bug advice??
