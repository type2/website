Subject: Re: [T2] Terrible engine noise????

 &gt;The best way I can describe it is to say it sounds like a baseball cards
in your spokes.. Loud clacking sound that seems to go along with the
pace of the motor. Could it be lifters are not pumping up?  If solid lifters maybe a clearance is wrong?I would pull valve covers and inspect valve train.  even run it with valve covers off and watch for something.Paul.
