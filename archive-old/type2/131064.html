Subject: Re: [T2] please help....

this was said....

 &gt; Anyways, if anyone is parting out an automatic between '73 and '75 or 
knows
 &gt; of a yard that has automatics or has a diagram that has specific details
 &gt; about the linkage - I'd greatly appreciate it!

I have a 74' automatic .030 tranny hooked to a 2liter fi. It's a neat config 
and
seems to work despite the vacumn settings and such.  What part of the system
did you need diagrams of? I could take pictures of the setup underneath for 
you
if you can tell me exactly what you would like.

I can't help you parts wise though.  I had an interesting time getting the 
tranny
when my original went this spring.  I do have a backup 4speed and linkage to 
go
into it sometime in the future.

James
