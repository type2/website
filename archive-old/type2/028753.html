&gt; Are all 68-79 Cargo door inside handles the same (interchangeable)?
&gt; Bus Boys has 1 for $35, Wolfsburgs is $40, and I don't see 1 at PartsVW.
&gt; But I may have found 1 from a '70 and want to make sure it'll fit first.


Always check the Depot on price - I'm rarely more expensive and almost
always cheaper.

I sell these for literally half the price, because I import them myself -
$19.95, for genuine VW.  (However, the bad news is I'm backordered for about
3-4 weeks; waiting on my next shipment from overseas.)

Good news is the one from the '70 should work just fine.
