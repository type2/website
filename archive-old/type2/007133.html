&lt;&lt; Maybe the standard odometer is being confused with a &quot;trip odometer&quot; which
can be reset when you fill up with gas or start a long journey or change the
oil and adjust the valves?

FWIW.....

My '73 Euro Spec. Transporter has one.  These are listed on the parts CD and 
were likely optional.  This is the only part that I can tell was changed when 
it was imported from Germany back in the early Eighties.  My setup is in 
miles, but it matches the clock and other gauges, so I assume it is the 
correct vintage.  The kilometer version is also listed in the ETKA parts CD, 
but I was told it was no longer available when I tried to order it while I 
was in Germany in October.  BTW, I'm looking for the correct KPH speedo with 
the silver center.
