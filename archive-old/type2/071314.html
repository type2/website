Subject: I just got a tent for my Westy
Message-ID: &lt;ce17b4f5.24a85fc7_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

  Due to some good karma I was offered a Westy tent and bought it for $45 
dollars.  It's the drive away that looks like a circus tent.  Blue top, 
bright yellow walls with red and white striped awning.  It's in great shape, 
and has all the original poles except one.
  I need some advice on how to best take care of this thing.  Should I treat 
the canvas or leave it alone?
