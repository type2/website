Subject: RE: [VB] Dead on the road

  I think the idea is to get back on the road to get the bus to the show and
then home to do it right. The crank and flywheel are more then likely junk
now anyway and they can complete their journey, have a good time and make
permanent repairs when they do get home. I drove 500 miles leaking massive
amounts of oil in order to make the shows I was heading to, finally had to
park the bus and hitch a ride home and that was only because the clutch was
slipping to much to make it any further. Bussing is about doing it, road
side quick fixes, etc. At least that is the way I feel about bus driving.

  If you can find someone with a crank dowel hole jig you can do it
yourself. These are the jigs used for 8 doweling a crank and flywheel. It
is easy and can be done fairly quick.

I think I'd spend the money to get the van back home and do the job right
with a new crank and flywheel.
Store your bus somewhere.
Ride the Grey Dog Bus home and come back with a trailer / tow bar / tow
dolly and get your bus.
If you don't do the job right you'll never be able to leave town in it
for distant locations without that nagging feeling and having anal
twinges at every tiny noise.
