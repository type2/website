&gt;Volks,
&gt;
&gt;I am playing with the vanagon 
 see nothing that says
&gt;flat out &quot;this is FI rated&quot;  I do see a length of something that *looks*
&gt;FI rated, but won't put it in 'til I am sure.
&gt;
&gt;The markings on this length of hose are:
&gt;
&gt;VW TL 5225 E 7x3 K DK 3/41/96 VRT

If it is black fabric braided cover, it will meet specs. Though this type
of hose was created originally for carbed apps, it still is suitable for
the 30psi+ running pressures. It was used stock on FI VW's from the 60's
T-III's up to at least mid 70's T-II's.  If it is smooth rubber outer and
has a center cord structure, it is the later type of FI spec hose. This
same hose is sometimes found with blue outer layer. 

The only part of the numbers you give I know is the 7x3 is the int. dia.
and wall thickness in mm's. My guess is the 3/41/96 is the date of
manufacture, day of week/week of year/year. German calender weeks being
with Monday, not Sunday which is the last day of their week, per the
Hazet-Werk calender on my wall.
