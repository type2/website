Subject: It's a Friday thing- Was [T2] CHT  installation

Since it's Friday, I've got to make a comment.

Every time I see &quot;CHT&quot;, even though I know it's supposed to mean
Cylinder Head Temperature, my Navy experience takes precedence.

On ships, CHT means the sewer system of the ship including the piping
and holding tanks.

Makes me do a double take every time.
