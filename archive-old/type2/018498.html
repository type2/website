Subject: '78 FI Hoses &amp;  Replacements
Message-ID: &lt;3765C56D.AACB4A46_at_home_dot_com&gt;

Hi All,

I'm about to finally replace the transmission in my '78, so must pull
the engine. As I look at the maze of hoses in that compartment, I know
that I will inevitably have to both take some 'before' photos so I know
how all this goes back and also do some labeling. This is my first trip
into 2L FI engine. 

First, are there any web sites with information and photos? Second, can
I still get replacement hoses for most or all of these ? This bus purred
and had about 140# compression all around when it rolled in here almost
two years ago, but most of the hoses look like they should be replaced
as part of this adventure. Someone could probably make some money with a
good kit and some instructions..

Bentley is little help, the archives have more questions than answers
and I see that the Robert Bosch FI manual is out of print. Anybody have
one they would like to sell ? 

I'm now considering this bus as my daily driver to replace my '71 until
I finish bodywork on her. The idea of having a heater with blower is
also real nice for the PNW winters.
