&gt; My engine is out. Wasn't as bad as I thought.
&gt; Could definitely do it a lot faster next time.
&gt; Removed the torque converter to have a look.
&gt; Definitely leaking from the seal.

now the seal is actually on the tranny part not the TC

&gt; Also, looks like the torque converter is broken. The ring that the bushing 
&gt; is inside of seems to be broken off.

???

&gt; So, is there anyone who has an extra torque converter for an auto tranny? It 
&gt; is for a 79.

I think I have one you can borrow til you get yours rebuilt

&gt; I've been stranded in this town and used up all my money, but if someone can 
&gt; help me out I will be more than happy to send them $ sometime next month 
&gt; after I get home and then go back to FL and have a chance to work a little 
&gt; there.

that bugger is heavy, how to handle shipping
