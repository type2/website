Subject: Pulled my first VW engine yesterday

Hey, Type2 sisters and brothers,

I accomplished my first VW engine pull over the past 12 hours. It was 
not a pretty pull, but it was effective. I forgot to detach the 
accelerator cable and that made for a lot of head scratching, but it 
eventually came out. Everything is thickly coated with oil and years of 
neglect, soon to be reversed. The right hand heat exchanger was cracked 
at the weld all the way around the flange, but for two inches. I thought 
I had a loose flange! The rear motor mounts are shot. The heads both 
look okay, so I will clean the valves, examine the guides and seats, and 
lap the valves back in. The #4 piston is shot -- pitted beyond 
rehabilitation. Too bad, because the cylinder looks okay. The gaps in the 
rings were all lined up, not staggered. I'll have to go shopping at 
Ecology and cross my fingers.

Somewhere I got the idea that I can't do anything to clean up the stock 
oil cooler (it's a 2.0 L engine), inside or out. Have I got that right?

Not a bad day's work for a 46-year-old-fart with a cervical radiculopathy 
(which isn't responding to medications or chiropractice).

But when I put the engine back in, I think I will enlist some help. 

Go forth, and sin no more. From the top of the food chain,
