Subject: AVP and Heads

I wrote to the list at the end of Sept about the valve seat loss on my new
head.  Valve stem just kept getting longer and I could no longer adjust
valves. I promised when my experience was over I would write the list.

They had me ship back the head and within 3 weeks of them getting it I had
another rebuilt head.  No arguing or anything.  Just shipped it back,
explained problem and they shipped another back to me.

Started installing it yesterday till it looked like it was gonna rain.  Hope
to finish tonite :)

Thanks for the advise to help me determine to go ahead and ship it back
before more damage was done.

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
