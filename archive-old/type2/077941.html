Subject: [T2] 2nd draft, '78 bus

&gt;I am 20 yrs old and I own a 1978 automatic vw transporter(bus). I bought it a few months back. The previous owner gave me &gt;paper
work stating they had a used engine installed with a single ford carb.
&gt;The mechanic took a wrench and tried to turn the motor by hand. He told me the motor had seized. So I had the motor &gt;replaced. Just
the motor. Now when I drive my van. I can't step on the gas and go. It has to warm up for a bit and even then &gt;the gas has to be
pressed on with the touch of a feather. If you press on the gas too fast it will cut off, if warmed up then it &gt;stalls then jumps up
to speed and still might cut off. when i do actually get it going, it drives fine and transmission shifts fine. &gt;when i get it
started it will sit and idle ok. what would cause it to cut off when i try to put it in gear and press on the gas? the &gt;delay of
acceleration?

Let's identify what you have and work from there. Find the code letters from the engine # on the
engine case ( not on the fan housing ) along with the carb # and the dizzy #. ( mirror and a flashlite -it's on the base
of the distributor forward and not real easy to get to ). Is this something your mechanic can't resolve ? Why not?
Does the carb have a choke ? How cold is it where you are ? Is the basic engine in good mechanical condition ?
You might consider getting a Haynes manual and doing a little late-night reading. ( under the covers with the flashlite :).
