&gt;Even a radiant heater laying on its back under the sump would probably
&gt;work better than a little dipstick heater.

Or a drop light with an incandescent bulb.  Preferably with a metal
reflector.  On a Bus, it might help to set the light on a rock or
cinder block to get it a little closer to the sump.  Maybe put the
hook over one of those heater-box-to-tin straps and string the cord
over the muffler to hold the light up?  Either way, use a looong
extension cord and snake the cord in through the window and around
the steering wheel, or at least around the driver's door handle, so
you don't forget in the morning.  If you've got a timer, have the
lamp come on three or four hours before you want to drive.

I've put a drop light under the oil pan on non-VW cars and it works
OK.  I used a heater with a magnet on the oil pan of my Ch_at_vy (backed
up by a piece of pipe strap around the heater and pan as a clamp) and
that worked even better, but it may be hard to get a magnet to stick
to a VW sump.  IIRC, the magnet was too big to stick on a VW sump
plate, even the kind without the drain bolt in the center.
