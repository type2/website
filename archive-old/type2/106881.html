&gt; This is my first post to the Type 2 list.  I just bought a 1970 Bus [Black and
&gt; Red two-tone, with flames on the front], and I can't get it started.  Here's
&gt; the deal:

congrats!

&gt; -The PO [Previous Owner] says that it always started up fine.
&gt; -The battery was dead when I first tried to start it.
&gt; -I installed a new battery [12 Volt]
&gt; -When I installed the ground lead to the battery, there were a whole lot of
&gt; sparks, and there was a considerable amount of smoke coming from around the
&gt; alternator/carburetor section of the engine.

this is not a good thing. Did you confirm you hooked the battery up
correctly? IIRC the correct battery for busses has the terminals
reversed from what many people cary as replacements, so when placed in
the tray the correct terminals are not on the right side. Double check
those wires.

&gt; -The bus still won't start

see above

&gt; Is it possible that I put a 12V battery in a 6V system?  Keep in mind that
&gt; this is my first VW, and I'm much more accustomed to working on old Mopar
&gt; Slant Sixes.  If I fried something...what would it be?  I basically just need
&gt; some advice that will help be troubleshoot the problem...and yes, I'm going to
&gt; Napa tonight to order the Haynes manual.

No it should be a 12V last 6V busses were split windows in 66. I'm not
sure what you might have fried, but smoke is what makes electrical
devices work, &amp; you released it to the wild :)
