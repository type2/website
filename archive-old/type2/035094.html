We are just going to have to agree to disagree, Stephen. The list admins 
deplore rancor and in the face of it, they're likely to shut us down.

But to state the locus of disagreement, it is this: human relationships are 
complex and unpredictable systems. Volkswagens, by comparison, are 
simplicity itself.
