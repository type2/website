&gt; &gt; There are supposed to be one-way flapper valves on the fan shroud assembly

I happened to find some of these at a junkyard and H. Steve photo'd 'em
for us! I imagine another reason they're so scarce is that those little
hinge pins just fall out eventually from engine vibration. I figure when
I put these on my fan shroud I'll peen the ends over or something like that.

These are the small plates that screw on where the heater boxes meet the shroud:
