Subject: Re: [T2] Re:Valve and Rod job... I think.

Buy the books and some tools and start learning. For $150 you could have 
every book and tool you need to do ANYTHING to the bus short of rebuilding 
the tranny.

You've got a resource that most of us &quot;older&quot; shade tree mechanics never 
had - this list. &lt;grin&gt;

It takes a couple hours to pull the engine, couple to put it back in. Give 
YOU the opportunity to fix alot of stuff along the way that MUST be done 
like replacing the fuel lines.

It would take me DAYS to work and save up the money it would take to pay 
off a $450 mechanic bill. That means to me that I have DAYS to get the 
motor out and diagnose it before I break even.

In short his time is more expensive than my time.

Someone mentioned one time that the VW was designed so a teenager could 
repair it any place in the world. Takes very simple tools, basic knowledge, 
and 3 basic test tools - multimeter ($15), dwell meter ($20), and a timing 
light ($25).

Don't waste your money paying them, learn how to do this work (not hard) 
and you will have a skill available to bail yourself out anytime your 
antique VW gives you a fit.

When I hurt my hand a few years ago (almost lost two fingers - not related 
to my VW projects) my wife completed the rebuild on our '78 Westy 2.0 FI 
engine. She did a great job and now years later the engine is still great.

Hang in there. You can do it. We're here for you.
