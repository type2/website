&gt;      I recently purchased an '80 Westy that had a great interior but 
&gt; wouldn't run (paid $200).  I'm currently rebuilding the 2.0 but have a 
&gt; couple of questions.
&gt; 
&gt; 1. In an effort to fix the problem the PO removed the fuel injection 
&gt; wires (I don't know why!). The problem is he didn't mark electrical 
&gt; plugs so I can't tell which injector to plug them into.  I have a 50% 
&gt; chance of getting them right.  How can I find out which plug goes where?  

If you lay the wires in place, the &quot;bend&quot; in them will probabaly tell you 
where they went.  However, it doesn't matter since the ECU fires all the 
injectors at the same time.  That is, you can't get it &quot;wrong.&quot;

&gt; 2. Is it necessary to always replace the oil cooler with rebuilding the 
&gt; engine?  Is it possible to flush the oil cooler out and replace it 
&gt; later?  I'm on a limited budget with this project, but would like to 
&gt; start camping locally ASAP.

No.  Unless the engine self-destructed and there's a real risk of metal 
particles contaminatting the cooler, you can clean it out and use it 
again.  Slosh a solvent through it several times until it's perfectly 
clean, let the solvent dry, and you can use it again.
