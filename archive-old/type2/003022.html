&gt; HOWDY!
&gt;
&gt; Just a reminder - Buses On The River is NEXT WEEKEND! August 17-19!
&gt;
&gt; We have received GREAT verbal reponse from a LOT of campers, thus far.  It
looks like the turnout
&gt; is going to be even better than expected.
&gt;
&gt; If you can plan on attending, and are interested in a group planned food
menu, then SIGN UP for
&gt; the BREAKFAST BURRITOs (Sat. morn.) and the SUBMARINE SANDWICH and SALAD
dinner (Sat. eve.).
&gt; Check out the website, look for updates, and then email me, Travis.
GoodOleVolk_at_yahoo_dot_com   Just a
&gt; couple of people have signed up for food, and I have NOT made a page
update becuse virtually ALL
&gt; food items are still left open.  If you have signed up - don't fret!  I've
got your information
&gt; written down!
&gt;
&gt; Check the website for updates, as they occur.
http://www.geocities_dot_com/goodolevolk/busriver.html
&gt; The food page will be brought up to date as soon as I get some more
postings.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks to all,
&gt; Travis Adams
