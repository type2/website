HI Phil

I didn't see an answer to your post,,
I assume when you say firewall,, your talking about the engine access hatch found on
the later buses...

As your 72 didn't have one,, your going to have to fab something,, I have seen the
hatch installed with urothane like a windshield,, also screws , rivets, weld... and
duct tape.

I was really impressed with the urothane one,, it was a really nice job and
completely sealed the hostile engine atmosphere from the inside cabin air...
ensuring the gases didn't get into the cabin.
That is also the easiest to do imho, as you just lay the goop on the deck and place
the door frame into it.. just like putting in the windsheild.

If you need more info. just ask,, do you have pictures you can post?
