&gt; Hello all,
&gt;
&gt; I've been a list lucker for some time now, secretly longing for a vw bus.
&gt; Now I would like to get your responses and opinions on a bus I have an
&gt; opportunity to buy.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The price is $5800. and it is firm.
&gt;
&gt; We are looking to use this bus to travel and camp in, perhaps a vw show
&gt; here and there. So any opinions, comments, things to look out for, etc. would be
&gt; greatly appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; Sorry for the long post.
&gt; TIA

In my opinion, $5800 is an incredible amount of money to pay for a post-79 bus with no
heat.  I wouldn't pay that much for anything other than a pre-67 that was really in
good shape.  Unless this bus is in immaculate condition (no rust at all, no bodywork
ever done, everything is there, brand new tires, documented new clutch, and documented
maintenance, clean inside, ect.) I wouldn't go paying that much for it.  But if you
love it and you really think it's worth it, buy it, but make sure you are going to be
happy with that bus and not be jealous of your friends with their splits and bays and
westys.  I had a '68 bus that had no rust at all, and it was beautiful, but I sold it
for an ugly rusty 77 westy because that was what I wanted.  I got $3800 for that 68,
and I bought the 77 for $900.  I regret selling the 68, but I would never give up the
77 that I really love.

    Just make sure you know that you're buying a bus you will love enough to drive for
more than a few years, because you probably won't get $5800 from anyone else.

ps  I tend to stay away from people who say the price is &quot;firm&quot;  even if the price is
$500, because usually it's not worth that, and they know it.
