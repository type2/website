Well, as it happens, I'm an actual living and breathing librarian
(although I do systems, not reference at this point, tho I have done the
ref desk too) and sending out copies of a few pages of a book or
magazine is done every day by just about every library in the world. Try
it -- just find an article in a magazine your library doesn't own, go to
the ref desk and ask them to get you a copy of that article, and it will
be done. 
    So I'd say, yes, that's fair use. You aren't copying the whole book,
nor are you charging (although that is done every day as well, and
legally too), and I can whole-heartedly assure you that you won't have a
problem. OTOH, if you want to put it on your webpage, you will have to
get permission from the publisher first -- and you probably won't get
it. In fact, many university professors who have webpages, and who want
to put the articles that they themselves wrote -- and which were
subsequently published by some journal -- are quite upset to find that
they can't legally do it -- and often the publisher won't even give
*them* permisssion to put up their own work on their webpage.
