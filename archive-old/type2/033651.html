Subject: Re: wave to buses/DC area

Hi Jeff,

You are right, I've only seen 7 buses around the DC area at the most.
I've seen a red Westfalia around 7th st. SE in DC, and I've seen a blue and 
white whale-top camper with about a million gauges on the dash in 
Arilington.  It hasn't moved for over a year and it makes me want to enquire 
about it further.  The other buses I've just seen around random places.

I myself am driving an orange and primer 77 Westy with a brown sliding door. 
  It's ugly but runs well and I love the power of the 2.0 FI.  When I am not 
driving that bus I'm driving my '76 standard that is yellow and white with a 
full german rack on it.  I have a white 73 Westy but it doesn't have plates 
yet so I have'nt been driving it around - of course.

So if you see someone driving one of the above described buses waving or 
following you around to look at your bus it's me.
