Subject: [T2] Intake Manifold question

Would anyone happen to know where I could find a dual-port Intake Manifold 
for my bus? I just bought a new 34PICT3 carb for my dual port engine but the 
stock 70 carb and manifold were still on it from before and so the new carb 
will not fit until I find one.  Thanks for any help...

Stuck with fingers crossed,

Will
70 Camper
