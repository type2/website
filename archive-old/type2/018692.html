Howdy!
    I have (sadly) decided to sell my project. It is a 74 passenger bus.
All the seats are there, and all save the front 2 are in great shape.
The body is good, save for the normal slight rust around the windshield,
and the right rear quarter panel, where I inadvertantly did some kinetic
customizing the first time I drove the dang thing. It has an 1800, and
it runs. I doubt it will pass smog, as 2 of the cylinders are low. I
have been driving it with a temporary tag, and it runs decently, albeit
a bit underpowered. When I did the (minor) crunch, it slightly bent the
tail pipe, so the back pressure and the jiggle the exhaust got has give
it a series of slight exhaust leaks. All the glass is good, and it is a
decent looking bus with very little rust (mentioned above, and a few
bits of surface rust). Tires are good, too.
    It is not smogged, and will not be smogged by me. It is sold as is,
as a parts vehicle (do with it as you will). I really like it, but I
have neither time, money, nor a place to work on it...sigh...

I want $600.
