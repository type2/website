That FI from those 411 and 412 is tricky business, unless you get it off a
74..that was AFC.  The older stuff is manifold pressure controlled, and you
have to have the correct heads or heads that are tapped with breather pipes
for it to work right.  AFC is much easier to work on.

My 412 has the old stuff, and it was tricky to get it to work.parts are NLA
and only found on another donor vehicle.............
