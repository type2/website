Subject: &lt;F&gt;In Da Biz!

I'm working my second day today as shop rat/web mistress at my local VW FLAPS,
Patti's Parts Palace (http://www.pattisparts_dot_com). Woo-hoo! Wednesday we
cleaned up some links and I got familiar with the files and processes, and
we'll be updating things as we figure out where we're going with this.

One of our missions is to get Jim's used parts stash sorted out -- I know he's
got some goodies in there. He already gave me a good vacuum tube that goes
between the brake booster and the carbs, along with the hardware to tack it in
place on the firewall tin.

More news as it breaks....

Nikki
