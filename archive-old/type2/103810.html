Subject: Intake Air Dist - Fat Hose Rpl Help

Sorry to bother everyone with this question...

For a 2.0L FI engine, is there an easy way to replace those four short fat 
intake air dist to manifold tube hoses without first removing the intake air 
dist?  I've got a massive vacuum leak (only pulling 5 in HG) in my 79 bus 
that I'm troubleshooting and I'm getting to the point where I may need to 
replace those four hoses.

I've disconnected the decel valve, brake booster hose with no change.  Next 
step is to disconnect everything (dist, fuel pressure reg, decel valve, 
brake booster, air box, aux air valve) to see in vacuum goes up.

I can also hear air being sucked in during idle, but maybe that sound is 
normal for a FI engine?

I've searched the archived postings to no avail...

Thanks,

Bob Forrester
