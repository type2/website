Subject: My new roof rack

Last night I transferred the rack from the newly aquired parts bus to 
my campmobile.  Originally I had estimated that it covered about 3/4 
of the roof.  On the bus I just bought it was mounted far to the rear 
and hanging off a bit.  I remounted to my bus at the front and it goes
back to about the middle of the bus.  I guess that makes it a half 
rack.

I don't know the origin of the rack.  There are either no markings or 
I am not looking closely enough.  It does appear to have made by 
someone to go on a VW.  It sits in the rain gutter on six legs.  Four 
clamps grab the bottom of the rain gutter.  It weighs maybe 30 pounds 
and sets up a nice howl about about 45 that 
continues right up to my cruising speed of 58.  This might be remedied
slightly when I fix the end caps on the tubing.  I am not crossing my 
fingers.  A fairing like I have seen on Yakima racks might be in the 
works for the future.

I plan to clean up the rust on this and paint it, 
probably to match the bus.  Come to think of it, I should just leave 
the rust if a match is what I am after!  I am also going to mount 
several bike mounts to it somehow.  This rack is very sturdy.  I can 
open the sliding door and using the sink as a step I can be on the 
roof in a matter of seconds.  I demonstrated this several times last 
night to anyone who would watch.  If you are lucky enough to be at 
BBTA this Saturday you can have a look yourself.  Jim
