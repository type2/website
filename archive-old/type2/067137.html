Subject: Re: '78 sliding door and Nice Bus page

&gt;Also, I was looking around the other day and found that &quot;Nice Bus&quot; homepage
&gt;by some guy, Sean O'Brien, who has it up through Princeton.  Well, I was
&gt;gonna write him for a survey but the mail wouldn't go through so I searched
&gt;the Princeton directory for his name, but I guess he's not listed.  Maybe
&gt;he just dropped out, but I'd still like to get a hold of him to talk about
&gt;this book he's supposedly writing and see if its for real or what...
&gt;Anybody know him?

Hi!

I took that survey last January and shortly there after he put an end 
to it. He emailed me for GIF's of Her Majesty to be added to his page, 
which I forwarded, but he never got back with me and the photos are not 
on his page... so... maybe you're right, he's probably just dropped out!
