Subject: Re: [T2] Strange Tranny Action [long]

I had odd grabbings while waiting at a light also, and it got to the
point where it acted like the clutch was not depressed- the lining on
the flywheel side had delaminated (came off rivets??) and was all caked
up as if flung owtwards.  Might explain the chatter I'd get sometimes
when taking off, and it would go away if I pushed the pedal ina nd let
out again.
