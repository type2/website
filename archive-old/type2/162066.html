Hi Don,

Agreed wholeheartedly. But at the time they seemed like  a very good  
idea. I was a stranger in a strange land at the time and didn't have  
time for comparison shopping or reading the archives before making a  
purchase. I just wanted to make the high-speed lurching stop.

Good value? Hell no.
Made things better in the short term?  YUP???
Gonna buy another?  Not on purpose. But if I had to, I probably would.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
