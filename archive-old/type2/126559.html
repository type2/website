Subject: Re: [T2] Foam Seal Questions

Yay! It's in! It's harder to get around the carbs than I expected. heh

The overlapping section right in front of the fan: I tucked in as much
foam as I could, then applied the &quot;high temp&quot; (Yeah, right) duct tape
to the outside. I know it won't last very long right above the
mufflers but it will help seal the gaps and hold on to the bits of
foam that I managed to get to poke through.

I have a gap of about 8&quot; though. I'll try stretching it some tomorrow
but I'm not expecting much. I tried to stretch when possible (read:
not in front of the fan) so I don't know how much more I can gain. :-(
At least the opening is at the top between the carbs. Could be
worse...

Has anybody noticed how useless the wire seals that come with the
Bosch plug wires really are? I can't get them to be flat enough to do
any good. Is there a better solution?

At least the worst of the gaps have been taken care of. I feel a
little more comfortable about driving Great White now...
