Subject: Re: Heat for da bus.

Here is what I have been considering, and would like 
opinions on it. At SAMS, they sell a 5200 btu 1500 watt
ceramic heater for about $25. It pulls ~15 amps. I was
thinking that I might get this, an inverter, and
a second battery, probobly a marine deep cycle. I would
use this to a) plug into the wall in my garage to
heat the bus up initially, b) plug into the inverter
while driving as a supplement, not a replacement, of
the stock heater.

I would like to set it up to run only off the aux battery
but use the alternator to charge the aux batt as well.
Is this possible? Also does anyone know how many *spare*
amps I have. For example IF my alt (these numbers are
hypothetical, and I will gladly take any info on the
real numbers to replace them) puts out 50 amps, and
when running all of my available accesories (lights,
wipers, radio, etc) they only pull 35 amps, this
would give me 15 amps to spare. RIGHT? 

I obviously could stand to read up on how automotive
electricity works.

Thanks
