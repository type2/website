Subject: Fuel Line Replacement - '74 &amp; Earlier Bus w/ Carburator

From: Shawn.Luft_at_Completions.Bombardier_dot_com

&gt;I have written up a technical article for fuel line &gt;replacement of '74 &amp; Earlier Buses w/ Carburators.

Well done, it's nice being published in the library.

&gt;Thanks for recommending this one Billy!  It was so &gt;easy, I don't know why I waited so long!!!!

Shucks. 
Yes, Much easier on a carbed bus.

Suggestions:

Is your bus single carbed?

68-71 was single carb stock
72-74 was dual carb stock

Perhaps a subsections for dealing with the extra carb?
Or two articles?

&gt;By Shawn Luft, with help from Billy Price's FI line &gt;replacement article.

For god's sake take some credit, man! :)

&gt;- 3 feet of 7.5 mm low pressure fuel line

Feet!? Don't you live in canada son?

Billy
