Congratulations! My favorite! 
I had the same problem when I bought my bus for restoration....EGR valve
intact but no filter. Avoid the pitfall I fell into. GET THE RIGHT FILTER. I
figured there would be differences from year to year, so I got a good used
one from a scrapped '76. However, mine is a California vehicle and the donor
was not. Big difference. It took a considerable amount of modification and
jerry-rigging to make it fit....marginally. Call all the used parts dealers,
mine was in fine condition for $40 from VW Bus Heaven.
Good luck!
