Subject: RE: Running my computer off an auxiliary battery

   I recently received a catalog from a firm in California called REAL
GOODS. One product featured was a set-up to run laptop computer using solar
(photovoltaic) cells. This might be of interest to some of you on the list.
It's a great catalog- I think most of y'all would enjoy it!
For space reasons, they feature different products in each catalog, so you
may have to write &amp; specifically request information on the computer power
cells if you're interested.
