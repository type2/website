Subject: Engine heat

&gt;The next time you run your motor, feel the alternator.  Better yet, look
&gt;at it.  Notice that it is connected to the air-cooling system.  No
&gt;combustion happens in the alternator, yet it gets very hot.  Friction.
&gt;Friction exists in nearly everything that happens, and contributes a HUGE
&gt;amount of heat to everyday life.  Any time something contacts something
&gt;else, the temperature of both things rises, due to friction.  It is a
&gt;subtle contribution, but it is there.

Remember that the alternator is not just a thingy with friction on its
moving parts.  It is a bunchof magnets being forced to move in a field
created by other magnets so that electricity is induced in coils.  Take all
the electro-magnetic stuff out of the generator and then spin it and see
just how hot it gets.

I don't know just how important this whole discussion of friction is, but
here's another example from real life.  I spent many years as an aircraft
instrument technician.  There are two ways airplane gyroscopes can be made
to spin.  The cheapest is using a huge vacuum system and sucking air
through the gyro, which has a rotor with little cupped vanes on it.  You
can actually make a gyro spin 20,000 times a second using this air-blast
method.

The second way to spin a gyro is by making it a motor.  Larger gyros work
this way, usually using 24v 400hz aircraft power to spin larger rotors.
These things go a little slower than the air rotors but are actually more
stable because they have greater mass.  So guess which gyro gets hot?
There is virtually no heat in a spinning gyro blown by air.  There are
actually little rotors the same size with nearly the same rotational speeds
that run on either air or electricity and the air ones run very close to
dead cold.

Which is not at all to dispute your claim that there is friction
everywhere.  Feel the top of your CRT :).  These are fun speculations, but
I am still not convinced that most of the heat that comes off an air-cooled
engine is from friction.
