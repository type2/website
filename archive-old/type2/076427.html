&gt; &gt;&gt; What is the difference between and arc welder and mig welder?
&gt; &gt;arc welder takes skill, even I can use a mig welder  ;8*}
&gt; 
&gt; for that you best be good.  MIG welders, buzz boxes, whatever you want
&gt; to call em feed wire and an inert gas from a trigger handle.  This is what
&gt; you weld sheet metal with for body work.  Local Ace Hardware and Quality
&gt; Farm and Fleet have em as cheap as $250!!!!  Even cheaper you sometimes

I put out a little over $500 for a Lincoln and gas tank, conversion kit,
full tank of gas, large roll of wire.  (get large bottle of gas)  add in a
little over $150 for a self dimming mask.

and I was on the road, used up about a tank of gas before I was doing a
reasonable weld.  start where it won't be seen

&gt; to be scoffed at the flux core wire is really nice for welding outside where
&gt; your gas can be blown away but generally speaking it is better to pop
&gt; for a MIG where you can run gas and still run the flux core wire if you

I got a large cardboard box and reversed it and use it as a shield to
protect from wind and accidental viewing by locals

&gt; need to.  Century, Lincoln, Hobart, all have cheapy MIG welders down
&gt; to as low as $350-400, they are all about the same in this price range, things
&gt; to look at are what you think of the feed roller system (how well you think
&gt; it might hold up, plastic (Lincoln) versus metal (Century)) whether it takes

hmmm, my Lincoln has metal feed rollers, maybe they had too many
complaints or something.

got mine at a local welding house that was moving and selling stuff at
good prices so they didn't have to move it to their new location. 

YMMV
