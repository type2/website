The best advice I got for this, which won't help you now but will the next
time your changing plugs, is to tape your socket to your wrench. This is the
only reason that I didn't lose my socket down there. Of course, this didn't
stop me from losing half the plastic covering on the old plug down there,
but that's another story.....

----------
&gt;&gt;        Hypothetically speaking, say you are changing your spark plugs for
&gt;&gt;the first time, on your '76 bus.  You read up in all the manuals, check the
&gt;&gt;web site and get the procedure straight.  You work carefully, doing the three
&gt;&gt;easy ones before moving on to the dreaded no. 2 cylinder.  As you are trying
&gt;&gt;to put the new plug in, the plug and the socket it is in fall of your wrench
&gt;&gt;and go deep inside the engine tin.
