Subject: Re: Fw: Saggy Rear End - any other sites available?

HotVWs did a story on raising the sagging rear-end of a bus. I think it was
a 71 camper. I saved a series of articles they did while fixing up this
camper. It would make a great set of web pages except for copyright issues.
I'll take a look for it and scan it for emailing if your interested. You'll
have to be patient though.

My infamous VW mechanic refuses to fix mine unless there is a problem like
bad bushings because it is such a bear getting them apart and back together
you just don't do it for a sagging rear end. He wants to sell me coil-overs
(&quot;stiffies&quot;) for the rear-end to fix it. I actually lean towards lowering
the front a little bit, except that is harder and more expensive then
raising the back.

PS The PC game Beetle Buggin is great fun for $20. I haven't played it
enough yet to get my hands on the busses, but I'm looking forward to it. My
wife is much happier with me playing a driving game rather then a shooter.
Thanks for the tip!!
PPS Now you know why you have to be patient :-)
