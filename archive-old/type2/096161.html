&gt; &gt;&gt;I think the key here is that you use Whatever

&gt; Deal on a set of tires&quot;! and mention the size 
&gt; you want--This always works for me.--As a lot of
&gt; 
&gt; Because there are no reinforced 205s currently
&gt; available to my knowledge.  If anyone knows of
&gt; anything, send me the data and I'll post it to
&gt; the tire page.  

yeah I've got a feeling I may have to figure out how to stuff 215s into
mine the next time I need tires...(anyone tried it??) since good light
truck tires are still avaliable in that size
