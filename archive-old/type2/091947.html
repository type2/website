Subject: 75 EGR &amp; oil pump questions

Thanks for the advice on the oil pump. Decided to save my bucks and get
a new one from Bus Depot. Does he really have original equip pumps for
only $80.00. Not bad.

Does any one out there know about the vacuum controlled EGR on a 75 bus?
Asked about this before but got very little feed back. I'm trying to
find out where the EGR valve should get its vacuum. Tried the port on
the air distributor box above cyl. number 4 and the port on the throttle
assembly that points to the front of the bus. (The one the dizzy is
hooked to.) Either way the engine tries to stall when the throttle
closes from any open position. After a moment of really low RPM (if it
doesn't stall) the revs seem to return to normal? Wondering if I need to
readjust the throttle position switch under the throttle assembly? Looks
like a PITA now that the engine is all back together. Am I way off base?
Any advise is good advise! I can use all the help I can get on this one.

Tom
