Subject: re: Drag coefficient &amp; buses

&gt;different vehicle types. The VW part comes now - The utility class is based on
&gt;a VW Kombi, which am assuming is either a single cab or double cab.It lists
&gt;the drag coefficient as 0.46, and the frontal area as 2.72 metres squared. I
&gt;can only guess that the drag coeff is higher because it is a ute, but one
&gt;would expect the frontal area to be same.

I'm not sure why &quot;utility class&quot; and &quot;Kombi&quot; and &quot;pickup&quot; are presumed to
be the same, but it they actually are the same you can probably explain the
extra drag with the tailgate of the truck. Tailgates are drag death, it's
like digging sand with a backhoe.
