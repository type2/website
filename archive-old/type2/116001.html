Good. You can't get to the middle zerk without doing that because the sway
bar gets in the way.

&gt; It took about a
&gt; whole tube for the 4 zerks that it had.

Wow! Did any grease come out the ends?

&gt; It is supposed to have a fifth
&gt; zerk in the middle but none is there.  What do I do?  Is it possible that
&gt; there never was one there?
&gt;It felt like a hole when I probed it.  Would
&gt; it suffice to try to pump grease into it without a zerk?

I don't think so. The zerk is a one way valve. Go to the dealer and order &quot;N
018 515 1&quot;.
