Subject: Re: [T2] Remote cooking thermometer for oil monitoring

Dean,

Look at this:

http://store.yahoo_dot_com/comfort/polkittherwi.html

Mine generally runs about 2 years on a battery.

Hi/low alarms and you can get an extension for the probe at radio shack 
that changes the reading by about 2 degrees.

In boiling water at my altitude, it might be 2 degrees off to start with.

They will also sell you replacement probes for about $9.00.

Cheers, dave

&gt; anything like what was mentioned here at my Wal*Mart months ago.
&gt; Amazon had a couple, but what caught my eye was this $40 dual probe
&gt; remote-read-out backlit smoker guage. (Yes, I'm a gadget geek,
