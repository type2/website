&gt; what do you think?  I am at a loss.  Sorry to be a pest on the list, but I
&gt; need some help, this one has me stumped.

Have you verified that the points are actually opening &amp; closing while
the engine is turning over? It could be the distributor isn't seated
all the way in the groove. There is also the possibility that rubbing
block has broken off of the points. I'd verify these things as well.
