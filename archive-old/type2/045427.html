&gt; Will you please go slide your ash tray out of the runners, and tell
&gt; me.....
&gt; Just exactly how is the ash tray face plate affixed to the ash tray??

&gt; If a metal face plate, is it held on to the ash tray proper with a
&gt; single nut that screws on to a bolt coming off of the back of the face
&gt; plate?
&gt;

This is the arrangement in my '68 Adventurewagen, hope it helps.
