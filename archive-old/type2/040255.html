Subject: Re: Rear seat belts, was Bus Legalities

I've never seen a Mazda in a bus, but there have been a few bug
conversions.  If it can be done in a bus it would be a snap in a bus.

I'm currently looking at the Subaru SVX 6-cylinder.  I am trying to figure
out if the Subaru tranny can have its ring gear flipped like a VW's for
bus use.  This would give a nice 5-speed transmission with the ratios to
match the power!
