Chris,

From what I've seen/heard, NAPA generally carries GL-4 on the shelf. In 
fact, I just bought a gallon for my friend's '71 at a NAPA in California 
last weekend. That said, I ordered mine online:

http://intershop.amsoil_dot_com/cgi-bin/Amsoil.storefront/40b694f40287dd44271bd1f0e3f00741/Catalog/1160

or http://tinyurl_dot_com/2jdxh

It's definitely still in production.

Cheers,
Tom
