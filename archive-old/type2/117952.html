Subject: Friday Post: That westy feel. Restore Story Long

I have had a Bus in my possesion for about 6 years now. I got it when a 
friend wanted to sell it cheap. I didnt need it then, I had a 63 with high 
hopes of making it better. I really liked that 63 but it just wasnt &quot;it&quot;.
SO the 63 went away some years ago and I had this 1970 westy sundowner, you 
know thats the kind without the poptop. It had lots of water damage and the 
such. It was missing the table and the sink, and the chair behind the 
drivers seat. Well I got it cheap and it sat at home for a long time. Then 
we moved and put lots of our stuff in it and moved. It drove terrible. But I 
got that fixed with new parts for the front end. Still I hadnt done much to 
it. Its important to say that when you look at the underside of this bus its 
simply amazing. Original underbody stuff, no rust.

So last summer I took everything out. And it was empty. I redid the roof and 
painted the floor with hammertite.
Then it was used occasionally to get me to work. A big empty cavern.
Finally, I took the cabinets apart, painted, stained, and applyed wood oil 
to them. I bought baltic birch and replaced the walls. It was still empty.
Over the last two days, I put back in the cabinet the z-bed (why does my 
zbed suck? I mean other ones I had stayed open with I lifted up the seat but 
not this one). I was creative and pulled fabric over the cabinet instead of 
just blocking out the window. Kind of nice.
SO there is a seat behind the driver, there is a zbed, there is a closet. 
But I still didnt have that bus feel.
Then I installed the table. Oh yeah the Table!

THIS IS THE IMPORTANT PART!

I put in that table and sat at my seat. I was there, I mean all those 
memories of sitting in my bus, friends comming by and getting in, all of it 
revolved around that table. I had feelings and memories I hadn't had in 
years. It was a bus again, the bus I knew and loved.
It needs work to finish up, but that was the highlight, the table. Its like 
a party, notice how people gather in a kitchen? Well I had my table and I 
turned on the light above it and man I was THERE!
Best part of all was how excited my son got (he's 4) at how the bus wasnt 
some big empty hole but a place to play and enjoy. He got into the back and 
practiced sleeping, he looked at where the sink was going to go and got all 
excited about how you can wash your hands IN the bus. He was opening every 
cabinet and telling me what we need to fill it with.

There is nothing like a camping ready bus. Nothing. Its not a RV its not a 
car, its a BUS.

Still I am going to miss the pop top. But its the bus I have now, and I am 
going to make the best of it. This is the first bus I have had with power, 
and thats a unique thing. Still needs more work, I need to get the sink 
ready and get it in, needs new front seats, needs some brake work.

But my co-worked is amazed. You should see him look at it. He cant get over 
how cool a bus really is from the inside.

Thanks for letting me ramble, if you have drifted from the fold and come 
back to restoring your bus, I hope you get the same warm feeling I have.
