&gt;Unfortunately, the Bentley and Muir manuals are 400 miles away.  What is
&gt;the list_wisdom on this?  I was going to start with the regulator, but
&gt;does someone have a better idea?  Any tests to try?  I know that Bentley
&gt;had nice detailed tests, but I don't remember them (darn).

If the belt is tight and the connections are good, you could try starting and
running the bus. go back and push down on the tops of the generator brushes
one at a time while someone else watches your red light. If pushing makes the
light go out, and you don't have any replacement brushes, find a paint stirer
or some kind of light wooden stick, brake off a small piece and install it
between the spring and generator brush. This will compensate for a weak spring
or worn down brush long enough to get you to muldoon's saloon (hopefully!)

P.S. You did polarize the generator to battery when you installed the battery?
To do that; cut two pieces of wire (couple feet long) connect one to the
negative
battery post - other end to generator ground. Take second wire and hold it to
pos battery post while touching other end to D+ terminal. Voila, you're done.
remove
wires, start bus and see if light goes out. If neither of these things work, get
a
regulator.
good luck
