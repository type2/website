Subject: rust

ok, I hate to bring this subject up. I know it's been beaten to death
4 or 5 times over...or is that 40 to 50 times.  And yes, I have searched
the archives.

I'm wondering what folks think about rustbullet. I've tried POR and I'm
not too impressed with how it came out. I think I applied the second coat
too soon, even though I waited more than the time recommended. Folks on
Samba have good things to say about rustbullet. What I really want is
something that will stop my rust until I can get to a point financially
to repaint my bus. If I use rustbullet, can I later sand it a bit and have
good paint stick?  Comments?
