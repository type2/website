 &gt;Gas pedal Rod?
The spring that holds it on with a washer is the same as the ones that hold 
the heat
and fresh air cables.  (Behind the levers on the dash.)
They are also the same as the springs on the cooling flaps control rods 
(Inside the fan housing) in the upright engines.
I have seen the rods wear and the hole in the pedal elongate, so I've braised 
a washer to the rod and also to the pedal so as to renew so to speak.
This has worked for me lots of times.
