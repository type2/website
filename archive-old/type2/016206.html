&gt;Won't that same water then end up on the FLOOR? Won't that be just about as
bad
&gt;when it rusts? (Maybe not. At least it won't get worse as the windshield
frame
&gt;rusts out.)

That particular part of the floor would be an incredible PITA to fix if it
rusted out.  However, my feelings are that a VERY small amount of water will
even enter the bus.  If must first pass underneath the seal and then through
the holes in the channel and then trickle down to the floor.  I am missing
one of my kick panels and I have never seen any water running or trickling
down the inside of the nose even in hard rain.  The area behind the kick
panels has drain holes anyway and excess water would drain out and the
leftover moisture would evaporate.  The rust under the window seal is caused
because of the difficulty and lack of evaporation from underneath the seal.

&gt; Dave,

&gt; I did the same thing to my bus about a year ago.  It was obvious that rain
&gt; would collect in the channel underneath the seal and it would cause
problems
&gt; later.  I decided to drill 5-6 holes evenly spaced in the bottom of the
&gt; channel.  I used a small bit (5/32) which is plenty large enough for water
&gt; to escape, but not large enough to damage the integrity of the channel.  I
&gt; made certain to prime and paint the holes and I removed the dash board to
&gt; prime and paint the channel from the backside also.  The amount of water
&gt; that comes through while driving in a rain storm is too small to cause any
&gt; problems, but if you drilled too many holes or made them too large then
&gt; water coming in may cause problems.  It's been more than a year and I have
&gt; no signs of rust or other problems.  There may be better solutions out
&gt; there, but I haven't seen them.  By the way, I don't care what anybody
says,
&gt; water WILL collect under the seal.  One parts supplier tried to convince
me
&gt; that I simply needed a more expensive seal, but a friend bought one and it
&gt; still collects water.
