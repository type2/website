&gt; &gt;bus. I mentioned the knock and he said &quot;oh that's  your fire
&gt; &gt;exstinguisher not bolted down properly.&quot; oh..........
&gt;
&gt; Could be worse, you could of spent a few weeks of sleepless nights pondering
&gt; that ever elusive wiring diagram, checking every wire from here to kingdom
&gt; come, inside, underneath, cursing enough to make a truckdriver blush, just to
&gt; find out it was a blown fuse.

Happy bussing!
