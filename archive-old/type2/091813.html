&gt;Anyone got a right rear drum brake shoes push bar for a 72 Bus? BustedBus
only sells the 68 through 71 and the 72 is different. No one else that I
can see offers them and I dont have enough bug repellent or a Sherpa to
guide me through the dense jungles that are my local rust yards right now.

&gt;Thanks for the help!

FWIW, the VW PN is 211 609 629, fits left or right.  But since the VW PN
isn't usually stamped on these the best advice when heading for the
boneyard is to look for these utlizing the following VIN info:  2x2 2000
001 thru 2x3 2102 496 (Dec 72 - yep right in the middle of the 73 model year).

Here's a couple of leads that work for me most of the time:

Derek at Way Out Salvage in Arkansas - 479-665-4126

Interstate VW in the Lakeside, CA area 619-443-4123

BTW - Anyone brave enough to own a 73 412 definitely requires BOTH Bug
Repellent AND a Sherpa '-)....My best bud owns 7 of 'em, 1 parts wagen, 3
projects in progress and 3 very roadworthy, driven daily.
