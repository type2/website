Subject: no reverse in auto trans update

  I looked at the selector lever cable and made sure it was adjusted properly 
and no luck.  It is also shifting erratically while in D.  ATF level is OK 
and doesn't smell burned.  I have a hunch that soon it's not going to move in 
D.  Has anyone switched from an early auto trans to a later auto trans?  I 
called around today and it seems that I can get my hands on a 76-79 auto 
trans without problem but no early ones.  It's a real PITA getting out of 
parking lots without R, lots of strategic planning and an occasional push.  
All suggestions appreciated.  Marcus
