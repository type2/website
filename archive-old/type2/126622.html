Hmmm.... Since I'm building the cabinets from scratch, I wonder how
difficult it would be to make the portion over the engine compartment
removable?

DPO had cut the stock cabinet next to the bed to be under the bottom
of the window, while the rear of it was full height. I plan on keeping
that basic concept. So I could conceivably make the cabinet over the
engine compartment attach with latches so it could be easily popped
out...

Back to the sketchboard. But it's not like I carry full sheets of
plywood regularly. In fact, this was the first time in years I've
bought plywood at all. LoL!
