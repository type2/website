&gt; Check out my newest member of my VW family. I kinda feel like one of the
&gt; animal shelters that rescue animals that have been abused. I just wonder if
&gt; I should shoot this one and put it out of is misery ?

David:
I'm agreeing with Ken's implied message that the paint job is a definite
asset.
A serious problem might be why the sliding door is not installed. Is it
a rusty track or something more easily solved?
While my favorite year might be 78 or 79, there is very little
difference in performance of ANY type 4 engined bay window bus.
1.7 = 66 DIN horsepower ( 62 with automatic- softer cam)
1.8 = 68 or 70 DIN horsepower
2.0 = 70 DIN horsepower
Each year has special qualities (?), but they are all nice.
This looks like a keeper to me.

69 double cab, and MANY other rescued ones in my shelter!
