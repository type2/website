Subject: Re: [T2] Drive it really far, it just might make it

Our bus, too, is a daily driver as well as a road trip traveler. We made
three trips from Kentucky to Michigan (~1200 miles each) this spring and saw
only ONE Type 2 on the road.  These trips were all made without any
significant troubles, as well as a week-long trip to Florida and a camping
trip to Missouri. I wouldn't hesitate to jump in her right now and drive
anywhere.(Knock on wood; from my lips to His ear.)
My advice is to do your mechanical best for your bus, then drive it! They
don't get any better while they're sitting in the driveway.
