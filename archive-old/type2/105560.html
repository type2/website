Subject: Barrel Shims, once again

Hi all:

I've now cleaned up (removed all the ragged cuts and excess material from
the stamping process) and carefully measured out 5 sets of barrel shims; 3
sets from the Bus Depot and 2 acquired locally.  All of the shims are
remarkably out of spec to their nominal size with the closest measurements
coming in at 4 thousands over and one set as much as 8 thousands over.  Is
that the norm these days?  Anybody bought these directly from VWofA (I
shudder to think of the price) and can comment on their quality?

TIA.
