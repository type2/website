gas just works so much better

&gt; I cut up an old steel bed frame to practice one, but am having one hell of a
&gt; time getting penetration through the steel!

has the steel been tempered, some bed frames are spring or hardened
steel??

&gt; Duroc suggested slowing down the wire speed - which I did, but then I have a
&gt; hard time maintaining an arc, and the results are the same.

turn up the amps, the other switch on most welders....

&gt; Eventually, I have some spots of my Rivi that I want to weld panels into,
&gt; but I hear that heavier gauge steel is great for practicing on.

true

&gt; What am I doing wrong?

well the big mistake I was making was trying to move too fast,  stay in
one spot longer, until the metal puddles
