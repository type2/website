&gt;Nope, the load would be taken by the spring plate and the trailing
&gt;arm, which together make a very strong triangulated swingarm.  The
&gt;axle never takes any axial loads.  Normal dynamic loads on these parts
&gt;are much greater than any static load that this device can impose
&gt;unless you do something stupid like drop the car into the tilted
&gt;position!

and, upon reconsideration, I'm in agreement with him.

These things are tempting - it would sure beat lying under the bus with
all the crap dropping in your face while you're trying to work.
