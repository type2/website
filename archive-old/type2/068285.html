&gt; &gt;        The function of the heater levers is a mystery. Can anyone tell me
&gt; &gt;what the 2 red and one
&gt; &gt;blue levers do?
&gt; 
&gt; The blue one controls the two 'fresh-air flaps' in the front.  Up is
&gt; closed, down is open.  Check and see if you have the little plastic piece
&gt; in between these two flaps- if you don't the blue lever only controls the
&gt; flap on the driver's side.  The red ones- I don't know what they do
&gt; separately, but down means you're getting heat.  

Emily is right about the blue lever.  For the red levers, the right one
controls how much heat gets into the car by pulling a cable attached to
the heater flapper boxes at the rear of the car.  Down is heat on and
when the lever is all the way down, the blower fan in the engine
compartment is supposed to come on.  The left lever controls which vents
the heat comes out of.  If the lever is all the way up, all the floor
vents get heat, that's the two up front, the one at the back of the
walk-through, and the one under the middle seat.  If the lever is in the
middle, only the two footwell vents in the cab get heat.  If the lever
is all the way down, none of the footwell outlets get heat and all hot
air is routed to the defroster vents on the dash.

PS -- If you think those are confusing, don't buy a Vanagon :)
