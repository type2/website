Subject: 57 mm fuel hose or 2 1/4 fuel hose? Gots to get some

Hey all,
I got in touch with the Bus Boys (Thanks for eveyones responses) and
they informed me that they were out of the $19.95 upper rubber gas tank
filler connector but they recommended to try the dealership. By a fluke, a
guy had ordered one but his was a California model so they had mine in
stock $17. Hurray!!!
My new delemna is trying to find (57mm or 2 1/4 inch) fuel hose for the
bottom connector to the tank.  I have tried local Boat, Auto and Trucks 
Parts Stores.  I know John Anderson had recommended Gates. But I
can't seem to find a Gates in my area (Annapolis, Md.)
Any ideas.
