Subject: Re: [T2] misfire testing results

&gt; I'm mystified that it would run smoothly on #1 and #2 alone. Shows you 
&gt; how much I know.

Yes, it does run quite smoothly.  It doesn't have nearly the pickup or 
power, but the engine was not thumping at all, and it stayed rock solid. 
  It doesn't idle very nice, but at about 2500 rpms it runs pretty smooth.


&gt; Anyhow, have you checked for vacuum leaks in the line to the brake 
&gt; servo? I wouldn't be surprised if the L-shaped rubber thingie is cracked 
&gt; or isn't sealing properly--the connector that fits on the manifold near #3.

In my setup, a vacuum leak won't cause a misfire, it'll just cause a 
higher RPM because I have a MAP based system.  On a stock L-jet it'll 
cause a lower RPM because external air is bypassing the flapper door. 
Either way, it won't cause the kind of misfires I'm having.
