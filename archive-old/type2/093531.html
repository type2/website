Subject: Extension Tent  Anyone?

Hi List,
I have been searching hi and low for some information on this tent.  Joe 
Clark's page sat Harris Upham and Dan Soiney know something about these, 
but I can't track them down.  Is this thing that rare that no one on this 
list knows anything about it?  I have gotten lots of replies 'Where can I 
get one?'
Is there a Westfalia site that has some of their old stuff?

Thanks,
Jamie
