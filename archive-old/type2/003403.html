Dear List,

The archives won't let me access anything at the moment, although the search
function calls up the first few lines on many promising postings.

I believe I have found the source of my mysterious alternator/battery
problem.  It appears that the cover is shorting out one of the B+ terminals.
There is a post from David S. from Feb 200 that I printed out ans saved that
refers to the &quot;rectangular fiber insulation.&quot;  (Thanks David)  I can't
figure out how that (which I have now snapped in half) is supposed to
insulate the terminal.

I don't want to put electrical tape in there;  too hot and I'm afraid of
what will happen if (when) it comes loose.  The best I've thought of was
several coats of liquid electrical tape.

Any suggestions welcomed.

Thanks.
