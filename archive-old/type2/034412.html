Subject: HAL Wiring Harness

Volks,
   I have a '79 2.0l bus with FI with electronic ignition. I need to find
the wiring harness from the dizzy to the control module thats mounted on the
sheetmeatl behind the motor. The clips that hold the wires in the plactic
plug are breaking and its making good contact on the dizzy plug. I cant find
it anywhere and I would pefer to buy new instead of the junk yard fix. Any
comments or suggestions are welcome. I want everybody to have a safe and
wonderful new year.
