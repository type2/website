&gt;Folks,

&gt;I have been dealing with Wolfsburg West in ANaheim via phone
&gt;orders as well as in person when I am in LA, and their service
&gt;cannot be beat, period.
&gt;
&gt;Most folks on this list don't seem to know of them, but they are
&gt;at every major west coast VW show, giving away their great catalogs
&gt;and making friends.
&gt;
&gt;Call'em at 714-630-9653

Cjay,

Just called 'em. They ask that you send a $3 sum to cover postage
for their catalog, refundable on the first order.  Sounded very
friendly.
