&gt; The bently may be very helpful in identifying the parts I am talking about

&gt; Where the auto tranny meets the engine on my 79 there are some studs. ( If 
&gt; you turn to page 31 of the auto tranny section in the bently and look at 
&gt; number 35 in the picture you will see a ring. Directly to the left of the 
&gt; ring in the pic is a hole where a stud goes through and into the engine I 
&gt; guess.) There is one on either side of the tranny. My studs are not tight at 

these are the lower engine mounting studs

&gt; all, I can screw them in and out by hand. On the drivers side stud there are 
&gt; 3 nuts. Two are too big to catch the threads. they just slide on oand off. 

the studs should be tight,

&gt; The third one is the correct size and holds the other two on. Now, on the 
&gt; passenger side I have nothing. a couple days ago I had two that were too 
&gt; big, but not one that is the right size. And that is probably why today I 
&gt; have none on that side. What is the deal with all this. Do I screw the studs 
&gt; in all the way. Is everything suppposed to be so loose. are the too big 
&gt; bolts there as spacers.

they should have only the 17mm nut on there that is designed to hold the
engine on, the PO probably put the big nuts on there because he couldn't
get the nut tight enough with the stud loose like that.

&gt; Also, I relized the other day that my tranny ground strap has been broken. I 
&gt; have already replaced it, but I'm sure I drove around with it broken for a 
&gt; while. Should I be concerned. What could happen as a result.

you survived it,,  will probably start easier now but I wouldn't be too
concerned
