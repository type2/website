dunno about this particular item... but i've found a good way to pull lots
of things like bearings/bushings that have a center hole....

1) get washer that is the same size around as bearing.
2) file washer flat on 2 opposite sides
3) put bolt through hole in washer small enough to allow washer to wobble.
4) insert bolt/washer through bearing and then &quot;toggle&quot; washer so it rests
on inside of bearing.
5) use slide hammer or nut+another larger washer+large enough piece of
pipe/socket for bearing to pull into.

dont know if this'll work on your application, but its a good technique to
know.

peas,

Steve
