Subject: Re: [T2] Steel Braded Fuel Lines and Fittings

&gt; I think the line fron the fuel tank to the engine is poorly designed
&gt; and is a fire hazard.

I don't think so if you have the appropriate grommets in place.

&gt; I would like to run a steel braded line from a
&gt; fitting on the tank to the fuel pump with a shut off valve at the
&gt; tank.

Shutoff valve, good idea.  Steel braid, why add the hassle?  See below.

&gt; These lines would have threaded ends on them.  What kind if thread is on the
&gt; fitting on the bottom of the tank where the line now connects?

There you go.  There aren't any.  It's a plain nipple with the hose
clamped to it.
You'd have to fabricate your own transition for some kind of thread,
but you'd still have the same thing on the tank when you were done.

I have an article in the type2 library on this job, and Richard
Atwell's site has tons of data, tips, pictures and part numbers.
