&gt; Hi y'all,
&gt;
&gt; Just wondering if anyone has ever put in a 12V heater in their Van?

Gee, it's a little early in the year for this question to come up!  :)

Fact is, they don't work.  Assuming a 55A alternator, you can get a
maximum of 660W of heat out of such a device.  This is with BIG wires and
probably short alternator life.  In Canada you won't even feel a warm
draft!

Have you considered an electric motorcycle suit?
