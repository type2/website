Subject: Re: [T2] westy vs. campmobile question

A Westy is a Campmobile, simple as that.
Westfalia is the company that did the conversion and they were sold at VW
dealers under the marketing term Campmobile.

&gt; This question has caused me a great deal of
&gt; headscratching - the owner's guide lists the poptop as
&gt; an option for the Campmobile, but refers to all of
&gt; them as Campmobiles, not Westfalias. See this
&gt;
link:http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/type2/literature/manuals/manuals70westy.htm
&gt;
&gt; Also, the manufacturer's tag on my bus states that it
&gt; was made by the Westfaliawerke. Go figure. In any
&gt; case, the table is pictured and referred to in the
&gt; above manual for a 70 (I imagine a 71 would be the
&gt; same).
