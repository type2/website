Subject: [T2] More Ball joint/torsion arm Questions


&gt; Hello list,
&gt;
&gt; I've been following the resent threads regarding ball joints. I just got
the
&gt; bus-boys torsion arm set up the other day and hope to put them on my '78
&gt; Westy tomorrow (friday). BTW No core charge and and they look great. I
too,
&gt; have never done this procedure before and have some additional questions.
&gt;
&gt; 1)Do I have to do both sides at the same time?
No
&gt; Is there some tension thing I am missing?
No, it will make sense when you get into it -- I presume you think before
you strike :-)
&gt; Seems like I am (step 19 Mike Gensler, in Library)
&gt;
&gt; 2)My upper Bus-boys pre-pressed balljoints don't have the hex shaped
&gt; &quot;eccentric ring&quot; on the upper ball joint. Should I be concerned?
No, its on the old one
&gt;
&gt; 3)Are the torsion arm seals NLA?
Yes
&gt; Do they usually need to be replaced?
No
&gt; And what about the needle bearing? (Bentley 2,18 Fig 7-16) Does a 78 have
this?
Yes
&gt; and is it NLA?
Dunno
&gt; or usually worn to the point of needing replacement?
No
&gt;
&gt; 4)Should I use anti seize on anything when I put it back together?
Up to you, I didn't
&gt; Is it worth getting a socket that fits the ball joint nuts for proper
torque?
I used a SAE I think it was 1 1/16
&gt; And What kind of grease should I buy? Brand, type?
For non high-speed apps, I use a good Moly compound
&gt;
&gt; Also, I ordered (Bus Depot) tie rods, all four shocks, all new brake
&gt; pads/shoes and rear clyinders, front brake hoses, plus other stuff. Every
&gt; rubber seal/boot in the front end of this bus is shot. Now I find myself
&gt; wondering if I should do the front wheel bearings and swing lever bushings
&gt; while I'm at it.
&gt;
&gt; 5)Would this make sense? (bearings, swing lever bushings)
I'd do the bearings for sure, there's a lot riding on those little steel
cylinders -- I use Redline CV-2 Synthetic for all high-speed apps (CV, wheel
bearing)
&gt;
&gt; I have no clue as to how many miles the bus has on it as the speedo was
&gt; broken when I bought the bus in Feb (milage &quot;exempt&quot; on title). The bus
was
&gt; not well cared for either but, has no rust and will someday take the place
&gt; of my rusty '79 westy. I want something that will last a long time,
&gt; reliable....
&gt;
&gt; 6)Finally, any tips for the stabilizer bar clamps? the one with the slide
on
&gt; clip. C-clamp maybe?
PITA - 3 popped right off (I did 2 busses a few weeks ago) one required the
air hammer, 4lb sledge, increasingly bigger drifts.  Wanted to reuse the
bushing so we didn't go to the torch-wrench.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance and sorry this turned out to be so long. I'm sure things
&gt; will become much clearer when I start ripping things apart in the morning.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks a million,
&gt; Brandt
&gt; '78 Sagegreen Westfalia
