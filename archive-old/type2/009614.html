Much too early to throw in the towel. Take you 3/4 valve cover off and 
check the torque on the center stud nut. Is it less than 23 ft-lbs? I'll 
bet it is. Means you have to drop the engine and retorque that head.

You didn't say in this post whether you have an 009 dizzy, but if you do, 
16 deg. BTDC is about right.
