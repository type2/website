Volks- I don't know why I keep seeing this same topic popping up, but there 
seems to be this errant belief that busses were not meant to travel above 55 
because the speed limit was 55 at one time (!).  LOOK IN YOUR OWNER'S MANUAL. 
 I have a '74 westy (T4 1800cc) and my manual clearly says:
TOP SPEED: 79mph
CRUISING SPEED: 79mph
This is how VW designed them- to be run at high RPMs.
