Subject: Trip report and misc. ramblings... (long)

Boy, y'all were prolific while I was gone.  All that friction and
combustion, and me without my fire extinguisher.  I still want to know if
anyone has come up with a penalty for the Agatha Christie joke. :)

Well, I made it.  While the NYC leg of my trip was cancelled due to my 
desire to get some sleep and hang out in Albany for a bit, I had a great 
time overall and Spike handled the trip quite nicely.  Here's a summary...

Friday:  left Rochester, NY bound for Edinburg, NY (Sacandaga Lake).  Bus
was kinda loud because he's blessed with a hol(e)y exhaust system, but I
made the trip on a single tank of gas.  Did 55-60 on the thruway without
any trouble.  Got followed by a Northville, NY police cruiser for several
miles.  (And he was following *me*...turned around when I turned down my
grandmother's driveway)

I don't get it.  What is it about New Yorkers that prompts them to 
tailgate you on the interstate when there are no other cars around?  
If I'm doing 70-75 (in a vehicle which can safely maintain such a speed) 
and I come up behind a car that's moving slowly (like my Bus), I pull out 
well before I get close to them, go around, and go on my merry way.  But 
on more than one occasion, I had cars, trucks, and even tractor trailers 
come up behind me going 5-15mph faster than I was and then proceed to 
tailgate me when there was plenty of room to go around.  Some #$_at_#* in a 
conversion van even stayed behind me when I slowed to 45 in a 65!  As my 
fellow breadloaf owners will no doubt testify, if you can see the 
mickey-mouse lights on the roof of the van behind you, he's too close!  
(For the uninitiated, breadloaves tend to tilt rearward, meaning that the 
rearview mirror has very little range.)  

Makes you want to invent the &quot;remote-activated cinderblock dropper&quot;.

Anyway, I made it to Edinburg without trouble - no measurable oil 
consumption, a few gallons of gas, and no more trouble other than being 
followed by a Northville, NY cop who turned around when I got to my 
grandmother's.  

Saturday:  Left Edinburg, NY for Latham, NY.  (Near Albany.)

Had a near miss, but I now know that it is in fact possible to lock up 
all of the brakes in my bus, a fact that I'm sure a montgomerey county, 
NY official is very pleased about.  Seems he ran a stop sign in front of 
me, leaving me no choice but to test Spike's 40-&gt;0 braking ability.  This 
led me to the conclusion that (1) Montgomery county is no more selective 
in its hiring practices than Monroe county and (2) I need a new master 
cylinder...I finished my stop at about a 45 degree angle to the road; the 
braking was extremely uneven.  Something to add to the top of the list.

Repeat after me...&quot;I will not attempt to make my turn until I am certain 
there is room for me to complete it without blocking the opposing lane.&quot;  
By the look on his face, he learned a valuable lesson...

During my stay in Latham, I had two seperate groups of people randomly 
walk up to me and ask me if I could sell them pot.  Sheesh...one wonders 
why they don't buy DEA agents VW busses...

Sunday:  Latham, NY -&gt; Boston, MA -&gt; Easton, MA.

It was warmer on sunday, and I was worried about how Spike would do.  
Oddly enough, for much of the trip he seemed happier.  He seems to like 
Exxon 93 octane better than anything else.  Was able to do 65mph for some 
time without pushing too hard.  When I got into Boston, he heated up a 
bit (stop &amp; go + heat); when I stopped at Hahvahd Squayah, the dipstick 
was hot, but not too hot to hold.  Temp. guage is also at the top of the 
list.  It might have had something to do with the fact that within 30 
seconds of entering Boston I had returned to &quot;Boston driving mode&quot;.  
Those of you unfamiliar with driving in Boston could compare it to 
driving in NYC only at twice the speed and while ignoring all lane 
markings of any kind.  (Except crosswalks, of course.)  Spike performed 
admirably, and the good visibility combined with the fact that he's 
bright orange kept him safe and sound among all of the crazies.

As a side note, it seems the masspike is having a sale...my toll should 
have been $5.10 each way, but they only charged $3.25.  They have signs 
up flashing &quot;Reduced Tolls in Effect&quot;.  

I noticed a bit of backfire when the engine was hot...I'm hoping that 
replacing the exhaust system cures this, as I've been told it probably 
will.  Nothing too loud, but *I* noticed it.

Got followed by another cop as I went into Easton.  He must have found 
something better to do, though.  

Monday:  Easton, MA -&gt; Rochester, NY.

Picked up a friend in Easton and we came back on I-90.  Uneventful trip.  
Did 60-65 the whole way without any trouble.  Freakin' thruway gas is 
expensive!  Let Brendan drive for a couple of hours...he liked it, but 
had a little trouble getting used to the steering, especially when big 
trucks went by.  After all of that time with the Jetta (and all of those 
speeding tickets!) I'm still getting used to being passed on the highway. :)

Well, I'm home, I'm kicking back, I just waded through 50+ email messages 
and a ton of type2-digests, and Spike has now officially earned the title 
of &quot;Reliable Road-Trip Vehicle&quot;.   

Final stats:  Rochester, NY -&gt; Edinburg, NY -&gt; Latham, NY -&gt; Boston, MA 
- -&gt; Easton, MA -&gt; Rochester, NY.

Gas:  a bunch
Miles:  a bunch
Oil:  .75 quarts
Bus damage: none
Problems discovered:  Need brake work &amp; two new tires.  Left speaker 
connection is loose (inside radio).  Engine heats up a bit in traffic and 
backfires when hot, possibly due to large exhaust leaks.

Tune in this friday for Tom's comparison of Spike, the Wonder Bus and a 
modern &quot;minivan&quot;.
