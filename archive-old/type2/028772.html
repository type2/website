&gt; Then I just happened to place another order in the interim an after I
&gt; got done placing the order, I inquired about the prior one.
&gt; &quot;Sorry I can't answer that question on this line&quot;
&gt;
&gt; What the hell----I'm here, now, and I'm the one being inconvenienced,
&gt; just answer my question--- where's my stuff?


I feel like this is such a simple concept.  Why is it so difficult to get
across?

A year ago we didn't have a toll-free number, period. You had to order the
parts on your dime.  Now if you have part numbers you can order on my dime.
But all other questions still require calling the original toll number.
This is not an &quot;inconvenience&quot; compared to last year - it is an improvement,
another choice that you can make.  Just like my shipping policy.  Want the
rock-bottom price?  No problem, standard delivery, 7-10 working days. Want
faster service?  No problem, pay a little more and it's expedited. But don't
choose the rock-bottom option and then complain because it wasn't expedited.
And don't avail yourself of the toll-free &quot;orders only&quot; option, and then be
upset that the person who answered the phone could do nothing but take
orders.

If you would like every incoming line at The Bus Depot to be toll free,
including customer service, I can do that.  It will significantly add to the
cost of the parts that you buy.  If you would like every order to arrive
within a couple of days of when you order, rather than just expedited ones,
I can do that too.  It will significantly add to the cost of the parts that
you buy.   If you would like trained Volkswagen technicians to answer the
customer service line, I can even do that. It too will significantly add to
the cost of the parts that you buy.   I can offer an unconditional warranty
on everything I sell. I can have out-of-stock items hand delivered from
Germany by courier to avoid backordering a product.  I can personally fly to
your house and install the part for you. I can offer any service that you
can possibly think of.  But not for these prices.

I think that many people who complain simply do not understand the dynamics
of running a business.  My prices are lower than anyone else's, apples for
apples, practically accross the board.  In cases where my price is not
lower, you can almost be positive that it's because my quality is higher.
You can pay for your toll call to customer service, AND for express
shipping, and as a whole STILL save money compared to buying anywhere else.
If I started doing all of the things some would like me to do, my prices
wouldn't be so low anymore.

It's like saying &quot;Well, I shopped at Walmart because I liked their prices.
But I couldn't find an experienced salesperson anywhere in the store.  The
stock clerk couldn't answer my questions about the product. I had to buy
from a picture on the box rather than having a working demo in front of me.
When they were out of stock on an item I wanted, they refused to overnight
it to me at their expense when it came back in.  And then I had to -gasp-
stand in line for ten minutes at the register!!&quot;   What's wrong with this
picture?  If you shop Walmart expecting Walmart, you won't be disappointed,
and you will get some good bargains as well.  But if you shop Walmart
expecting Bloomingdales, you will indeed be disappointed, and no amount of
complaining that you can possibly do will turn Walmart into Bloomingdales.

I am very upfront about what I do and do not offer.  It's your money and
your choice.  If you want the best possible parts at the best possible
prices - and this I work very, very hard to offer - then I can do that.  If
your taste leans more toward higher-priced, full service retailers, then
please, by all means, patronize your local VW dealer or import auto part
store. That's what he's there for.
