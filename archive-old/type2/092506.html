hey Bob, I do have a garage that I can put stuff in and since I'm a 
bachelor, no one will complain!!!  I've already decided to go out there and 
get as much stuff as I feasibly can.  I'll also take pictures and post the 
inventory to the list to see if anyone wants copies of the pics.  You've 
made a good point, you can't save them all, but I'll at least try to do 
what I can.  Greg

&gt;I would love to get one of those engines and strip some parts off the 78,
&gt;but you are a tad far away to just pop in.   grab what you can and post
&gt;the info here and places like it and hope for the best. you can't save em
&gt;all unfortunatly
