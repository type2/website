Subject: heater blower

Hey all,
Well, I've been having a discussion with Bob Hoover, Craig Standley, and
Paul Wies about the heater blower, all prompted by Emily Jo Hanlon's
innocent question.  

Anyway, Craig and Bob contend that the alternator must be charging
before the heater blower will operate.  Bob pointed out to me that there
is a relay the controls this function.

On my '78 the fan would operate if the lever was down and the key was on
Alt didn't have to be charging.  Paul also tells me his was this way
too.

So now I'm curious.  I know that Bob has a '72 but I don't know the year
of Craig's bus.  Mine was a '78 and Paul's was a '79.

Is it possible that VW originally started out making it so that the
alternator had to be charging and then on the later loafs changed the
design so that the only the ignition has to be on before the blower will
operate?  

Does anyone have a Loaf Bentley to check this out?  I sold mine with my
'78.

Curious,
Sean
