Subject: High Hydrocarbon
Date: Tue, 23 Mar 1999 17:09:25 +0000

My MOT tester gave my '82 a pass at the weekend but did take me aside to
tell me that my Hydrocarbons were a bit high but that he was OK about it
this time. I nodded as if I knew what he was on about but since he had
already given me a pass certificate I simply wanted out of the station with
the prized certificate in my hand.
The question is, how can I reduce the Hydrocarbon content of the exhaust
fumes as next year I might just catch him on an off day.

PS For M.O.T. in USA read Smog test

Thanks
