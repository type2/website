Subject: Re: [T2] bus, not an ice-box!


&gt;Hiya everyone - I am a bit new to this list...
&gt;
&gt;My problem is (I think) quite common: I have a '76 bus which has a
&gt;malfunctioning heating system, it flows gas exhaust into the cab. In Italy
&gt;we lack of information on good mechanics who can help me fix it - I don't
&gt;know what to do and winter is freezing up here in Milan.
&gt;
&gt;I could try something myself but have poor information on how the system
&gt;works and getting parts often means buying abroad at great cost.
&gt;Also, my fair knowledge of specific english terms is not helping much
&gt;searching list archives...
&gt;
&gt;But I have a lot of enthousiasm! Is there anyone willing to help me?

Make sure that all of the cooling tin is on the engine, make sure that the 
engine to body seal is there and in good shape, and make sure the heater 
boxes are in good shape.

There is a catalog on a British website (Bugbits?) that has all the 
diagrams of the parts. Also the Busboys website has good diagrams.

I used to live in Napoli when I was in the Navy. I LOVE your country! 
Wonderful, nice people. Best 3 years of my single life!

Got an e-mail from my doctor friend near Naples (Casal di Prinicipe) this 
morning.

If you have more questions let me know. I am busy this morning and lack 
alot of extra time. I can send you copies of the diagrams you need though 
via e-mail.

You have a Beetle powered bus? (1600cc?).


Ciao!
