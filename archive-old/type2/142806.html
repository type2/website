Subject: Re: [T2] Valve adjustment Q

If your valves are showing too loose, the only things I can think of
(especially if it's only one valve) is either something blocking the
valve from closing all the way or the valve guide is binding. (Or the
rocker assembly is loose... Double check that.) A bit of metal or a
washer that got sucked in? Before anything else I'd be turning that
engine by hand hoping it comes loose. But if it does you run the risk
of destroying the exhaust valve on the object's way out... Up to you.
Might want to drop the engine and pull the head.. Unfortunately I
can't think of any other ways for that to happen. Even if you were way
off TDC it should be tighter, not looser.

That article confused me too. Me: Set TDC. Adjust #1 valves. Turn 180
deg counterclockwise. Adjust #2 valves. Turn 180 deg counterclockwise.
Adjust #3. and so on... How do they do 1&amp;2 at #1 TDC?
