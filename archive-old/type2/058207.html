Subject: NOS 15&quot; rims value? (FS)
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I've come by 2 NOS 15&quot; rims I take to be early bus wheels, they are date
coded 8/62 and still bear part number tags 211 601 027 E.  They are 4 1/2 K
x 15 rims and appear as new never mounted.  Perhaps these are simply bug
rims, are the bolt circles different, I don't know.  They have incredibly
slight rust dots here and there typical of long term garage storage but are
basically as new.  Interestingly the bear mailing labels for return to
Volkswagen Mid America as part of Group 2 &quot;buy back&quot; from a Wichita dealer.
I'm looking to sell them or for an idea of their value as I'm thinking about
partiallly trading them to a local for a straight rear bumper for the '70
which is asking $200 cash.  I'm wondering about the comparitive value of the
rims.  Or of course the rims are for sale.
