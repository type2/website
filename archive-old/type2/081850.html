Subject: Re: [T2] Question about parking lights

They are the front side marker lights. The rear side markers light up. The
ones in the doors are just reflectors. I guess it was cheaper and easier for
VW to add the light and wiring there, instead of putting it in the door.....

&gt; &gt;Speculate that when parked with the light switch pulled just to the park

&gt; &gt;small filaments in that mode.
&gt;
&gt; Having lived in Germany, that was the first thing that came to my
&gt; mind.  Nope, with parking lights on and key off, both the small bulb and
&gt; the large bulb are lit.
