In the past two weeks, someone contacted me looking for the address of the 
BOSCH part numbers for brains and other EFI parts for VWs.  I promised to 
send it, but then found myself unexpectedly in hospital having work done on my 
heart.  My brain was also affected, and I can't find the messsage.

If the issue rings a bell with you, reply to me (not the list) and I'll rspond again.
