Subject: Crappy Muffler - Bought a new one

The sucking-up-exhaust thing was getting old, so I went down and bought a
new muffler today.

The one I got is a &quot;mexican&quot; muffler, according to the proprieter, the
Liestritz mufflers are no longer available, and this is the same muffler the
use on the Mexican bugs.  Hmmm.

It was $89, and included the tail pipe stuff, with bracket, gaskets,
silencer pipe, etc.  I thought this was a pretty good deal.  The other one
ran me ~$140 once I got all the pieces together...

Quality: its impossible to tell whats inside until I crank it up, but the
welds on the two pipes going in the top are a lot better quality than the
German one.  On the other hand, the whole stamping does not seem as &quot;crisp.&quot;
I am going to strip the paint off, and weld the clamshell thingies where the
heater hose connects, and also re-do the bead along the whole seam of the
main muffler.  After that, it will be hard to tell if this one was any
better than the German one.

After the welding, I'm going to try some heat-resistant paint.  The stuff I
used last time actually stayed on except for on the muffler itself, where it
flaked off.  The problem with that application was I used it _over_ the
original paint.

I was going to weld tonight, but I came home to an ant infestion of X-files
proportions.  I was hoping Sculley would show up, but she didn't :(
