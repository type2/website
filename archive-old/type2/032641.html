Subject: RE: Re: type 4 cam swap

My understanding is that there's always a cost when you go about
swapping cams and such on Type4's or any engine. That is, low-end
performance or idle suffers for high end performance...or high
end suffers for out-of-the-shoot speed. I know there are people
on the list who can find some balance, but it's never as easy
as just swapping cams, is it?

Keep in mind, I'm not a mechanic or engineer, so I truly am past
my knowledge base when it comes to cam talk...but a couple volks
on the list are very comfortable in that realm.

One of the most interesting things I've heard of late is that
AVP uses the same cam for hydraulic as they do for solid lifters.
This gives me pause, because I just bought an AVP rebuild (with
hydraulics)...and when I built my 2.0 hydraulic engine last Spring/Summer,
I was told that the two were different. I believe AVP has a custom
grind on their cams in order to do this, but I wonder how wise
their approach is.

Thanks! Joe

&gt;Are there any performance type 4 cams on the market
&gt;that would be compatable with the fuel injection on a
&gt;77 bus or any other mods for more power.

See the following URLs:

http://www.webcaminc_dot_com/
http://www.elgincams_dot_com/main.html

They both have cams listed that will work with fuel injection
and should
give you a little more power.
