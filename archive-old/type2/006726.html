&gt; Internet Access Fee? JUST SAY &quot;NO&quot;
&gt; Forwarding the information below for those who may want to respond:
&gt; Congress will be voting in less than two weeks.  CNN stated that the
&gt; New Congress would, in two weeks time, decide to allow or not allow a
&gt; Charge to       your phone bill equal to a Long Distance call EACH
&gt;time you access the Internet.
&gt; The address is http://www.house_dot_gov/writerep/
&gt; Visit the address above and fill out the necessary form! Tell your
&gt;congressman to vote against Internet Access Fees! If EACH one of us,
&gt;forward this message on to others in a hurry, we may be able to
&gt;prevent this injustice from happening!
&gt; AND SEND A COPY OF THIS TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW RIGHT AWAY.
 
  I know it is not Friday but I believe this issue may be rather urgent and it
does affect our freedom and ability to access 'the list'.  I am prepared to
write to my congressman and to forward this warning to everyone I know who uses
the internet, but I do not want to do it until I am sure of what I am asking
for, i.e. how do I know this is not an 'urban legend'.
 
  Having written to congressmen in the past I am aware that a 'bill number'
should be included in any correspondence that is sent to them when I am asking
them to represent me by voting yes or no on that bill.  What is the number
of this bill you are referring to and asking us to write our congressman about?
                                                    Bill &amp; Janyce
