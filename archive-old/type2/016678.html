&gt; I put the European parts on the Members page,
&gt; http://www.busdepot_dot_com/members.htm.  Save this URL for future reference,
&gt; because it is a &quot;hidden&quot; page.  There is no link to it from any of the pages  on the website, as it is for Listmembers only.

&gt; p.s.  We've added a new confirmation feature to the website order form.  You
&gt; should receive an automated e-mail confirming your order within the same day
&gt; that you place it, followed by a personal confirmation from Jerry either the
&gt; same or next business day.  If you receive both, your order reached us; if
&gt; not, drop us an email just in case it didn't.  This may be overkill, but
&gt; you'll certainly get plenty of notice that we got your order!
Ron:
Found your hidden page, however, the one I'm looking for is the hidden
page listing the barrels of the strong bitters and ale that are hidden
from customs in that container! I visited England in 94 and want to
retire there! We experienced many wonderful things there but near the
top for me was the PINT! Seriously enjoyed your vacation reports and I
was really glad you could share some of your experiences with us on the
lists! And of course I enjoy your sharing with us the fine old NLA
German parts that make our VW's so happy!
