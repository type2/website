Subject: Re: air flow over cyl 1,3

 Mike B writ:

 &gt;I'm not so sure about reduced drag- this &quot;vacuum&quot; increases drag,
&gt;wheras if or rear were exteded into a teardrop shap, drag would be
&gt;decreased- I'm a bike rider and this is well know in Human Powered Vehicle
&gt;designs.

I think the Kamm Effect is one of those 'better but not perfect' items - a
teardrop shape WOULD reduce drag as much as possible, but then you'd have a
bus 20 feet long! Would make pulling the engine pretty interesting, too. So
they took advantage of what they could.


&gt;   Now let's move on- what does Craig have to say about leaving off the
&gt;plates under the cylinders/heads that block the direct flow downwards of
&gt;cooling air and direct it to the rear?  Are these there to help cooling or
&gt;just protect the pushrod tubes?   I have a feeling it causes &quot;stagnant&quot; air
&gt;to cyl. # 1 and 3, making them hotter?


I have no idea... I would guess the plates serve to direct air AND protect
the tubes... German effeciency, ya know :)

Someone send a holler at Bob H; bet he'll send us an earful about
'hydrostatic pressure' and 'plenum effect' and other reasons its better to
have the plates than not!
