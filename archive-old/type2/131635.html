Subject: RE: [T2] Loose Distributer

&gt;From: &quot;Kim Kariotis&quot; I went to change my distributer cap and rotor this 
&gt;weekend.  went to pull the rotor off and the whole distributer shaft? 
&gt;pulled right up from out of the hole in the case.

&gt;Looks like last week when it was at my mechanic, they forgot to tighten the 
&gt;distributer back up....No wonder why it wasn't running as good as it should 
&gt;have....


I am suprised it pulled out so easily. Did it have the O-ring seal around 
the shaft?
