Subject: Re: Spark plug #4

&gt; The compression test was fine. Everything in line with one another. Am
&gt; in the process of checking all the spark plugs. I did buy new wires and
&gt; will put those on today.
&gt;
&gt; The engine never ran bad. It just has this annoying little miss that I
&gt; hear.

You might check for a vacuum leak around #4 intake.



&gt; But what the hey no one ever melted from rain. (OK the wicked witch of
&gt; the east but she doesn't count)

Uh....she was the wicked witch of the west.    The witch of the east was her
step-sister and she got crushed by the house after the tornado stopped :)
