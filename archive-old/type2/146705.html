Subject: Re: [T2] fans

The caged fans in WalMart are noisy and give LOTS of RF interferance, as 
when watching TV.  High thee to West Marine or similar boating store and 
check out their 12 volt fans.  I have used Caframo since the early 
eighties; they still make a decent cageless 2 blade fan you can either 
clip or suction to a surface.  They are safe to bump into.  Quality has 
sunk since they moved from US production in Canada (hey Greg, go bug 
Caframo) to Taiwan- I still have my orginal black Caframo, changing the 
blade when needed- but the white recent ones have poor suction cups, a 
noisy blade motor and lots of play shaft with more TV noise than the 
original, and within 2 yrs the 3 way switch gives problems.  The suction 
cup you can unscrew and replace with West Marine's Tarp holdown cups; 
awesome all season hold on the windshield.  Pull out the tarp loop, 
stick in a wing nut (ground to fit) and screw it on the threaded stub. 
There is also a nifty 3 speed box fan that will fit in your front 
window, or stand on the bus floor blowing air where you want. Not cheap, 
around $70. Fans are efficient air movers and cool you down in traffic 
when little vent air is coming in.
