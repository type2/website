Subject: Re: [T2] my wife wants a price/amount estimate

, that a Bus would take about 1 gallon a coat. And ya' need at least one
primer coat, one color coat, and one clear coat. Well, you can get paints that
don't require clear coat, but their not too nice.

When I painted my '77, inside and out, plus the roof under the pop top (total
color change) is used just under one gallon of paint, which was Dupont Centari
acrylic enamel, which I would call a very &quot;nice&quot; paint-although wet sanding
may be required to get a really smooth finish.  Jeff
