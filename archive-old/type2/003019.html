Subject: Removing roof from a high top.

I have a 1970 Adventure Van. Excellent rust free California van with only
44000 miles on it. However, I have mixed feelings about the high roof, due
to wind resistance, poor gas mileage, and the funky look.  I have been
thinking about removing the high top roof, filling in the screw holes around
the roof perimeter, and getting a custom tonneau cover made (got a price
today-$400) to cover up the hole. Has anyone on the list done this before?
Any question of structural integrity? The opening appears factory, with a
steel strip border, not just cut out roughly or anything. It's about 6&quot;
longer than a Westy opening.

I stripped out 90% of the interior and replaced it with Westy camper gear
due to its' very poor condition. The Adventurer stuff wasn't nearly as good
as Westy, in my opinion.

Any advice pro or con would be appreciated.
