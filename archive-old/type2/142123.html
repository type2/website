Subject: Re: [T2] KONI Group Buy Shocks now available again!

&gt;  Is there a Koni Shock/Hankook tire bundle? ;-)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt;    Yes, but you hafta get Windows Vista for your
&gt; PC to get the whole package... ;-(


Nah, Linux all the way pal! Been Linux only for several months and life
is GOOD! (Of course I did use some black magic to install Windows Media
Player on Linux to view little airplane videos my friend sends me...)

(and no, not a bunch of obscure command line work - point and click just
like Windows)

VW content: bringing my '65 Beetle home tomorrow after about 6 years of
being stuffed in a barn...
