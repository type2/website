&lt;That's the sump plate that you see mentioned on the &lt;list all the time (usually in conjunction with the &lt;installation of an oil temp sender).
&lt;They do seem to be notorious for leaking.  They are &lt;sealed to the case with a large rubber o-ring.  I've &lt;found that the most common cause of
&lt;leaks on the sump are actually due to leaks at the 2 &lt;(10mm?) bolts or stud/nuts that hold the plate on.  They &lt;should each have a copper washer under them and &lt;I've found that some gasket sealer smeared on the &lt;threads of the bolts works wonders.

One problem that I have is breaking these studs of in the oil sump.  Does anyone have a magic cure for this?  I know some sump plates have a center drain plug, but mune does'nt.  I have to completely remove the plate to change my oil.

I am also looking at electronic ignitions, 009 distributers,  blue coils etc...  Does anyone have a setup that they recommend?  My engine is a stock 1600DP with 34 PICT Solex.  It's in a 71 Westy, with a ton of vacumn hoses running about.

Finally, I just bought this bus and the brake lights don't work.  I checked the bulbs, and looked at the fuses (was'nt sure which one it is).  Does anyone have any recommendations?

I also need front and rear bumpers for this bus.  Does anyone still make these?

Thanks,

Bryan
