Subject: gasket question

Hello everyone,
I finally got my muffler reattached. started her up and took her around the 
block. Most fun I've had in weeks. Anyway, I feel like I tightened 
everything off pretty good. Almost rounded off a couple bolts, but 
everything is ok. Any way, I have a leak where the muffler hooks up to the 
heater box. Would it be possible to just cover this seam with liquid weld or 
something? It may just be the gasket, but I don't remember ever not having a 
leak on either one side or the other at this spot and I just want to stop 
it. Thanks,
Kyle
