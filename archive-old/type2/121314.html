&gt; The left turn signal on my 71 Westy has been flashing

&gt; Both the front and rear bulbs DO flash when the signal
&gt; is on, just VERY VERY fast.  The right side signal
&gt; flashes normal, as do the hzard lights.
&gt; So, any ideas???

I had a problem like this when the + strap from the battery was not 
connected to the solenoid properly (very loose connection, and since 
that's the starting point for the entire electrical system...).

I would check that and the battery ground, make sure they're nice and 
tight.
