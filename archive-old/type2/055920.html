Subject: Re: adjusting hydraulic valves?

&gt; 
&gt; I got a question regarding the valves on my '81 vanagon, CU engine, 2.0l 
&gt; double-carb, hydraulic valves. This is the point: the valves: should I 
&gt; adjust them and how should I adjust them.


No, you do not adjust valves on engines with hydraulic lifters.

&gt; 
&gt; There are four suggestions, as fars as I know:
&gt; Don't do anything to the valves - one of my manuals says that.
&gt; Set them to zero clearance - remembering having read this on the list.
&gt; Set them to zero clearance and 1 turn in - remembering having read this 
&gt; on the list.
&gt; Set them to zero clearance and 2 turns in - my other manual says that.
&gt; 
&gt; Now I'm really confused what to do...
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance for bringing light into the darkness...
&gt; 
The only time you would adjust them is if you had the rocker arms off or
were doing some other major engine work.  The valves are not adjusted in
normal service like in engines with solid lifters.

If you do need to adjust them, zero clearance plus 1 turn seems to be
the way to go.
