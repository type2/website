Subject: Rear Suspension Bushings
Date: Thu, 27 Jul 2000 10:49:24 US/Mountain

Sometime in the next month or so I'll be resetting my rear torsion bars.  I've 
got tons of info from the resource library so I think I'm ready for that.  But 
what I haven't found is any info on replacing the control arm bushings.  These 
are the rubber bushings that are pressed into the control arms and are located 
at the end where the arms bolt to the rear torsion tube housing.  

I bought a pair of bushings from BusBoys last fall, but haven't done anything 
with them yet.  It looks like the fit into the arms is a helluva tight one.  
The bushings look to be a slightly different shape than the ones that are in 
there now, but the old ones may just be deformed from years and mileage.  My 
best guess is I have to completely remove the control arms and take them to a 
shop with a big-ass press, but I can't find any info on the procedure.  Has 
anyone ever replaced these bushings or had them replaced?

Thanks.
