SD&gt; (1)	Anyone know the	minimum	&quot;max load&quot; for a (rear)	bus tire?

GL&gt; 1520 pounds

 Yup. Which corresponds	to a &quot;95&quot; load rating. I'd be inclined to go
higher than this if possible, but they are thin	on the ground.
 The load range	C tyres	I have are rated at 99/97S (97 is 1609lbs)
wereas the load	range D	ones are 102/100 (1874lbs/1764lbs). I'm
not sure what the dual ratings mean, except that the unlettered
ones arn't speed rated.

SD&gt; (2)	If a passenger tire has	a sufficiently high max	load rating,
SD&gt; does it really matter if it's &quot;reinforced&quot;?

GL&gt; The	bus will handle	better if it is, as the	stiffer	sidewalls will be
GL&gt; more stable.

 But note that many (expensive)	&quot;low profile&quot; tyres with high speed ratings
have stiff sidewalls, too.

SD&gt;  (7) Any thoughts on the use of wheel adapters? (Fuchs wheels have a
SD&gt; different bolt pattern, so adapters	would be needed)

GL&gt; Adapters are never a good idea. Better to get wheels that fit.
GL&gt; I seem to remember somewhere that Mercedes wheels had the same bolt
GL&gt; pattern as buses. This might be an avenue to getting wider wheels.
GL&gt; It remains to be seen whether the offset is	correct	or not,	though.

 Also I	believe	that the Audi 200 five bolt wheels (may	be the same
as A6 or A8) are compatible. I think the offset	is 38mm	(it's listed in	the
owner's	manual,	I think, but I don't have mine to hand)	but don't
know how important it is to get	it exactly right. I have the impression
that it	just needs to be &quot;close&quot; rather	than identical.
 The Fuchs wheels are superb quality but, as you say, they won't fit without
some modification. There are other ways	of doing this (I think some people
have fitted Porsche spindles as	part of	brake upgrades)	but it's probably
more practical to take a different route.

 I'm (currently) planning to go	with a 15&quot; wheel, probably a used Merc
or Audi	one and	215/65R15 tyres. That gives a stock diameter, though,
which isn't what you're	after. This size seems to be the best tradeoff
that I've found	between	maintaining  stock size, availability of tyres
and trying to minimise the reduction in	profile. I've read that	using
low-profile boots isn't	particularly desireable	or effective on	a bus
so want	to minimise the	reduction in profile whilst still trying to
gain on	grip through performance-orientated rubber and a wider
footprint. I had wondered previously about using low-profile tyres to
lower the van but have since decided that this isn't a sensible	route
to follow.

 Here's	the list of candidates that I have identified thus far:

 Goodyear Aquatread II:	215/65R15 95S
 Goodyear Eagle	GT2:	215/65R15 96T
 Pirelli P5000 Drago:	215/65R15 96H/V
 Pirelli P6000 :	215/65R15 ??W
 Yokohama A509:		215/65R15 96H/V
 Kumho 716 Ecsta HP4:	215/65R15 95H
 Toyo RoadPro R610:	215/65R15 96H

 These are all upmarket	boots that will	last nowhere near as long as a
good set of LT185R14Cs as the rubber is	softer.	The service descriptions
are as follows:

 95S: 1521lbs 112mph
 95H: 1521lbs 130mph
 96T: 1565lbs 118mph
 96H:	 &quot;    130mph
 96V:	 &quot;    149mph

 A poster indicated some time back that	&quot;H&quot; rated tyres	have stiff sidewalls
to prevent heat	buildup	at speed (and also, presumably,	because	excessive
sidewall flex at 130mph	is unnerving! :-).
 The Pirelli Dragos and	the Yoko A509s look like the best candidates, but
I havn't priced	them yet and expect them to be somewhat	spendy...
 If anyone knows of, or	finds a	215/65R15 tyre with a 97H rating or better,
I like to hear about it. Maybe Avon make one- I	think they do some tyres
for big	performance classics like Bentleys.

 My rationale for using	this type of tyre is that a Porsche engined bus	is
essentially similar in its requirements	to a big estate	car (station wagon)
like a Merc, Volvo or Audi which will be heavy,	have a high Centre of Gravity
and yet	be capable of high speeds.

 I understand your rationale behind fitting taller tyres but I am thinking to
avoid that route because of potential handling problems- You will
simultaneously raise the CG and	increase the amount of sidewall	available
to flex, making	the bus	lean more in corners (and lane changes)	and also
more sensitive to crosswinds and truck washes. It's no coincidence that
manufacturers generally	lower their cars and fit low-profile tyres when
they uprate the	engines. Your driving environment will be different from
mine, of course, I just	want to	explain	my reasoning (and invite comment,
as always :-). Stephen Foster described	120mph in his bus as a white knuckle
ride- I	wonder if this is a factor (after all, his is set up for offroad use).
 The turbo-bus article that Joel sent us claims	that it	is &quot;rock steady	at
110&quot;, with the benefit of custom sway bars, lowering and a full	body kit.
 Personally I think that bus is	hideously ugly but I think it's	handling
will be	better than mine...
 Stephen is from Australia where roads are generally wide and often lightly
travelled (huge	generalisation,	I know..) and his bus is set up	to leave them
anyway so I suspect that on-road handling wasn't a priority. My	driving	is
on the narrow, often twisty and	quite densely trafficked roads in the UK so
handling is pretty crucial for me. Maybe this will help	judge what might work
well for you. I'd certainly be interested to hear what you decide and why.

 Anyway, this is already too long so I should wind it up. Hope it's useful
to someone and,	like I said earlier, feedback is always	nice...even (or
perhaps, especially) when it's negative.


Cheers,
	W.
