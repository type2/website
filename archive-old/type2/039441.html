Subject: missing at highway speeds

Hi, 

I have an odd misfire at highway speeds. About once every hour or two my 78
FI westfalia misses a few times then recovers. It does this consistently but
with no other problems. Starts, accelerates well, good power and  idles
well. It only misses on the highway and only after I have been going a few
hours. Never on short trips. Does this ring a bell for anyone? I changed the
plugs, wires, rotor, points, condenser, cap and set the timing as they all
had 20k miles. No change. Runs well but cuts out briefly on the highway. I
just went from Vancouver to Moab Utah and it did it consistently every
couple of hours for a brief second. Could a coil do that?

Bob
