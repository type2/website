&gt; But what you'll miss those expensive parts that
&gt; are usually available only by mailorder.  It's
&gt; just not a challenge when you can just walk into
&gt; any foreign car flaps parts place and pick up the
&gt; needed parts off the shelf---

So.....these &quot;off the shelf&quot; engine parts that are available at foreign FLAPS are designed, machined, and built to the same specs as the type 4 (or comparable quality type 1) parts that must be mail ordered?  

Hmmmmm, I always suspected there was really nothing to that that Gene Berg mystique!
