One piece of advice about baking soda blasting...  Be sure to clean the
soda EXTREMELY well and it would be a good idea to even &quot;neutralize&quot; the
baking soda with a spray of diluted vinegar and water (but be sure you
are ready to clean the vinegar as well and paint ASAP).  If you don't...
the baking soda will cause your paint to crack, bubble, and chip down
the road.

I soda blasted a 1948 Chevrolet pickup a few years back and it seemed
that no matter how much we cleaned the stuff off there was always some
residue of the soda somewhere.  As a result, I have a fantastic paint
job but only on 99% of the vehicle and touchups had to be done years
later.  I love the soda blasting... it doesn't eat holes in the metal
like sand... but you have to be very much more meticulous in your paint
prep or you will be using all types of profanity later.
