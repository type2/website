I am having some trouble installing a Gene Berg temperature dip 
stick, model GB 228. The electrical connections are no problem, but I 
can only put the stick in about 2.5 inches (yeah, real funny) before 
it hits some sort of constriction.

My original dip stick can be inserted all the way, IF it is oriented 
one way or 180 degrees from that. If I rotate the dip stick just a 
degree or two and try and insert it stops about the same place as the 
Gene Berg unit. If I have the dip stick in all of the way and try to 
rotate it I can feel it binding up.

Is there a slight bend in the dip stick tube?

Has been crushed a little by accident?

I would appreciate any suggestions for fixing this situation that you may have.

Have a good day.
