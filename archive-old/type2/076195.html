Subject: Roof rack!


Yay!

This morning I picked up a 1/2 roof rack for my bus, great shape, good price.  I've wanted one for
the longest time, and man, are me and my bus happy.  I keep wandering out onto the porch to look at
it, it's like having a new bus!  Forgive my exulting, but I'm just really blissed out.

Though I didn't know it till I got there, the rack was at West Coast Metric, a restoration place in
Torrance (Los Angeles).  Wow!  What a cool place!  A bunch of cars in a kind of showroom with lots
of memorabilia.  A strange beetle with a body made entirely out of white curvy wrought iron - looked
perfectly driveable.  A 1951 delivery bus that I think I accidentally drooled on.  And a REALLY cool
schwimmerwagen (sp?) complete with propeller and machine guns and stuff - it looked like Rommel had
just parked it for a minute while he ran in to buy more schnapps.
