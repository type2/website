Subject: Weber installation Problems

I just got my order in from Bus Depot today.
HURRAY!!!!
I am just having a little trouble figuring out how to
get my new weber carb connected to the engine like the
instructions say.  Anyway I have a '74 Auto with an
1800 engine.  Please help me.

I would like to thank Bus Depot for having such a wide
variety of items at reasonable cost.  Thank you very
much.

Kevin
