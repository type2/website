Subject: Covered, tinted, and other non-visible lights ----- Ahhhh!!!!!
Mime-Version: 1.0

Erg!

I have no more patience for the those drivers who insist on running tinted
plastic covers over their headlights, signals, and taillights. I almost ran
over a Cavalier recently who wore these things over his lights and oh by
the way - couldn't drive. He approaches his turn, hits the brakes hard and
then swerves. I lit up the tires on my old VW Bus trying to avoid his dumb
ass.... I looked twice and there was a blinker - but who could see it??

They are also joined by those who prefer to cruise the city streets at
night (usually the busiest streets) with the full tint job, and running no
headlights, only their parking lights. 

I hate government over regulating our lives, but I wish they would enforce
some common sense laws like maintain your vehicle's lighting system and
require the lights to be as bright as OEM. But of course those of use
driving older cars would somehow get the short end of the stick. 

Personally I love no vehicle inspections, no smog checks, no safety checks,
no exorbitant state fees on your vehicle but I wish the cops would stop the
idiots cruising the night streets with no lights. But maybe they can't see
them either..... &lt;grin&gt;

Maybe it's time to write the papers.

Keep up the great discussions though. I have learned much in the past few
months. No where else can follow so many great Bus conversations by so many
knowledgeable gear heads that really have some meaty questions to ask and
answer. 

Good luck to you all. I'll be right here reading. Who knows, maybe I'll be
able to answer something for someone - maybe....
