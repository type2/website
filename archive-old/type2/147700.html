&gt;just a quick question.  can i mix and match vacuum cans and distributors or
&gt;will this cause poor or no running?

You can't switch between single vacuum and dual vacuum without altering the timing. Watercooled vacuum cans tend to have less advance than the aircooled ones.

Some cans advance more than others. This could mean overly retarded or advanced timing so you should check the can. It's not easy to eyeball...easy to do on a dist. testing machine.
