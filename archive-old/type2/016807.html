Subject: Re:  Upstate NY Bus mechanic?

Travis, and the List:
                       
&lt;I was wondering if anyone knew of or could recommend a good Bus/VW
mechanic in upstate NY.&gt;

Try TLC Motors (518-766-5654) of Hoag Corners in Nausau NY for repair in
the Albany area.  No, this Nausau is not the Nausau of Long Island, but
is a small township here in the Capital District of Upstate NY.  Located
on NYS RT 66, about 15 miles or so from Troy, Terry LaCasse (owner of
TLC Motors) runs a 3 man VW only repair shop that sells used VWs as
well.  He also has many used parts available from the numerous cars he
recycles.  

I have bought three cars from Terry and intend to buy a 76 camper that
he is reading for me in the spring.  He rebuilds engines and would
probably undertake yours for a reasonable price.  I often find that it
is less expensive for me to have him do my repairs than go buy the tools
and do it my self. 

For you flamers out there, you gotta realize that some people like
myself have a tendency to break more than we fix when we get into a
repair job.  Also you must consider that you purchase parts and tools at
retail.  He purchases them at wholesale and knows the best way to fix a
problem 'cause he's probably seen it before.  Besides his rates are
$38/hr, the VW dealer is $58/hr.  Only takes me a couple of hours
pushing paper for the State to pay him, so why not spread the $ around. 
It's your tax $ at work!  

Having said that, I do carry a phase II tool kit in my cars and use it
for light repairs.  I do my own oil changes, occaisional tune-ups and
belt replacement.  But the heavy duty repairs like ball joint
replacement or clutch change-out goes to Terry.  It helps to know your
car and your abilities.  Nothing keeps your car running more reliably
than good routine maintence and fixing what breaks when it breaks.

For those of you in the Northeast, Mr. LaCasse has a number of vans for
sale.  I saw at least 4 vanagons of various ages (1 air cooled and 3
waterpumpers) on his lot recently and a '58 white splitie (walk thru I
think) with cargo doors on both sides.  No 'loafs at the moment but he
aquires cars sporadicly, so you can never tell what will show up.  A
couple of Beatles were there too, and lots of waterpumpers, even a
couple of Rabbit pickup trucks.

The '58 splitie has been professionally restored and has a newly rebuilt
engine (1500 or 1600cc?) done by his shop. The thing looks to me like
it's in showroom condition.  The only downside to it is that it has had
oak-wood paneling applied to it's interior by the P.O.  The woodwork is
very well done.  It is not a chinzy $10/a sheet panneling job with
materials from the local big box lumber store.  It appears to be done by
a cabinet maker who knew what he was doing.  It is gorgeous!

Price for the '58 splitie? I will find out if someone is interested in
it.  Don't ask me to test drive it untill spring tho, 'cause he won't
take it out of the storage barn untill then!  Road salt, you know.  It
makes cars taste better for the rust termites that live here in the
Northeast.

If you folks are interested I will post those vans/busses/campers that
Terry LaCasse Motors (TLC Motors) has for sale, their conditions and
warranty information.  I might even be presuaded to test drive one if
you are interested.  I always did like driving vans.......
