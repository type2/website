Subject: Re: Alcohol + Bus

For some reason, that whole episode scared me a little (I was the guy buying 
the bus). That cop was VERY aggro, at least when he first gpt on the scene. 
I had to TRY to break to ice. Luckily it worked. I guess we did have quite a 
junkyard going in the ol' condo lot at that moment. Come to think of it, he 
coule have run us out of town. Thanks for the crucial assistance with that 
bus, J. And how's she doing, Steve?
