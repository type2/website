&gt;  There was no continuity at all in some of the wires, and others had such 
&gt;  crummy terminal clips that the breeze from the cooling fan blew them right 
&gt; off  the plugs.
&gt;  

When I had my first camper it was fitted with standard leads, didn't know how
old they were, so I went out and bought some nice yellow silicone leads and
put them on. 

The problem was that they didn't stay on the spark plugs. The fixing at the
plug end of the lead was a metal cylinder inside of the rubber shroud and it
made a poor contact with the plug.

So I looked at the plug and the old leads. 

The plugs had a threaded section stiking out, and the old leads had a spring
clip in them.

I realised that the end of the spark plug uncrewed and that if I  got some new
plugs then they came with the ends screwed on. So I changed the plugs and ran
with the new leads for a year or so but even with a spark plug end that was
designed to fit the after market leads I never felt the connection was good.

Eventualy I bought a set of VW leads (a lot cheeper than the flashy yellow
ones) unscrewed the ends from the spark plugs and fitted those instead. 
As you fit the standard lead then the spring inside the lead fitting will make
a rasping noise on the thread at the end of the spark plug and you KNOW that
you have a good fitting that will not fall off. The bus idled better too.

I've nothing against after-market leads but if you want a good connection then
always buy leads with a spring fitting in plug end of the lead, unscrew the
end of the spark plug and get a positive fitting that will not fall off

Good luck
Bob
