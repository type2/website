Subject: water collecting in closet (77 westy) and converter box
Message-ID: &lt;f4112d79.24633831_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I have this puddle that will collect in the upright closet (meant for hanging 
clothes) in my 77 westy whenever it rains.  I can't seem to tell where it is 
coming from.  Has this happened to anyone else?  Anyone have any ideas?

I was also wondering if the electrical box in the deluxe westys had a 
converter built in so you could run 120V appliances without having to plug 
in.  If this is true does anyone have one they want to sell??

TIA
