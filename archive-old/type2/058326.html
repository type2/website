Subject: Re: Best accelerator pedal lube [was WD-40]

&gt;Yo,
&gt;
&gt;Did y'all know that the WD in WD-40 stands for Water Dispersion?
&gt;Eug

	Actually Water Displacement- the familiar mix of kerosine and
a little light oil was invented early in the cold war when the stainless
steel fuel and oxygen tanks of the Atlas missle were found to be corroding...
just like stainless steel knives in your dishwasher- moisture condensing
on the outside of the missles was was deficient in oxygen (like dishwasher 
water) and as everyone knows, stainless steel works like aluminum- it forms 
an oxide coat VERY quickly, and that oxide coat prevents further damage. 
No oxygen, no oxide and the underlying metal can then react with OTHER
chemicals, like whatevers in the local dust, and corrode.
	
	WD-40 will get UNDER water sitting on a surface, as anyone
who has 'dried' a wet distributor using a shot of the stuff will attest.
Amazing, unbelievable and it works. And so poor USAF erks got issued cans
of the stuff and spooged the missles regularly. A little kerosine and
light oil (3-in-one for example) works the same. Put it in a pump sprayer
and do the environment a favor. Or an old insect sprayer, as Mr Hoover
one said he does.

	Bottom line, WD-40 is a fairly good solvent, and can 'dry' a
distributor, but it ain't much of a lubricant. You want oil, use oil.
You want grease, use grease. Remember that graphite, teflon dust and
dry-moly-spray products are also available for places like accelarator
pedal pivots. I started using the teflon dust on locks and its COOL.
It would be my first choice.

	But you're the driver and maintainer in charge. Pay your money
and take your chances. Just don't expect WD-40 to act as a lubricant on
anything you value.

	Bill
