It's not just New York, I've been on a clear, 5-lane highway in Texas,
and had somebody get behind me, slow down, and I slowed down to under 20!
and they stayed behind me, slowing down, until they finally got a clue and 
passed me, leering at me and trying to show me something about their finger, 
I didn't understand that.  So anyway, as they passwd I got behind them at 
a reasonable safe, normal distance.

For rush hour traffic I keep a big throwing rock on my dash.  I make a point
to have it in my hand, with my hand out the window as the a$$holes cut me off
without signaling.  More often than not, they instantly get the message, and I 
see a look of horror on their faces.  It reminds me of when I used to drive
a motorcycle.  I always had BB's for a last resort (bad for radiators and
windshields.)

tom} Makes you want to invent the &quot;remote-activated cinderblock dropper&quot;.

I want a bumper sticker (when I get bumpers:-) that says &quot;I Brake for Tailgaters&quot;
in very legible, plain bold letters.  Does anybody have the resources to make
bumperstickers?  What would it cost to do that?

My Opinions.  My Employer shares them.  He HAS to.  He doesn't grok Unix.
