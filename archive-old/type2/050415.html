=====================================&gt;
Borrow a cat.
Be sure the cat is hungry.
Put the cat in the bus.
Start the engine, and drive the bus a bit.
Just smile while the cat meeows loudly at his/her fright of being in the bus.
Park the bus on a mall parking lot.
Go in the mall and get a Starbucks Coffee.
Return to bus.
Pet cat.
Drive away.
Feed the cat.
Give the cat back to the owner.
