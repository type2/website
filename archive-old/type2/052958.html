Subject: Races and Bearings

Volks,

I am rebuilding the front end on my 63 dunebuggy and would like to use a
nice set of drums that are NOT original to the car. I am going to sandblast
them, paint them, and have them turned.

My question is, do I need to install new bearings and races due to the fact
that these drums are not original to the vehicle?

The races that are on the drums are fine, with no scoring or bluing. Same
with the spindles. I'm just thinking that the previous drums have &quot;mated&quot;
with the bearings and races.

Any thoughts would be appreciated...

Matt
