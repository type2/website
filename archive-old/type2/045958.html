varous people said:
&gt;&gt; What about gel batteries? Can they be used with the
dual 
battery setup?

&gt;why pay twice as much for less battery, but yes they
can be 
used as a the
second battery

&gt;&gt; Do they charge the same?

&gt;no very different

Yes--they charge quite differently.  Gel cells need a
better regulation/charging system than &quot;regular&quot; lead
acid batteries, and would probably be destroyed, or at
least their life significantly shortened, if used in
an automobile with a common voltage regulator.  If you
used one as a second battery in you VW bus, to power
radio, etc., and not as a regular vehicle starting
battery, and if you had a more sophisticated regulator
for the gel cell battery, it could work well.  I don't
thinnk it is worth the extra expense for both battery
and charging regulator to use a gel cell in this
situation.  Of course, if a company comes out with a
gel cell intended for automotive starting and running
use, that is a different situation.
