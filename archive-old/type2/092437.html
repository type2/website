&lt;&lt; their mission was to turn a new beetle
into an air boat. so, what did they use to turn the fan for their air
power?...you guessed it - a 1600 ACVW motor!

i thought it was rather ironic that they placed an ACVW motor in the rear
the new beetle. the show is shot in cali, so of course the motor was
one of those &quot;see-through dist. cap &amp; shiny valve cover&quot; motors.

wonder if it was a GEX? &gt;&gt;
