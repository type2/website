&gt; Could you possibly be referring to the Rose City Volksters (and Good
&gt; Times VW out of Eugene) Bug Run at Woodburn?  It is scheduled for
&gt; June 2.  Used to be a member of the RCV.  I'm not familiar with an
&gt; event sponsored by DIP at Woodburn.  Fill me in on the &quot;other events&quot;
&gt; which happened (or didn't happen) besides the event at Woodburn. 

I just muddied the waters, I guess.  The weekend was just a couple of
events around the Bug Run.  I think they figured there was this VW
focus just down the way, so they figured they'd do a Friday night
burger / Sunday swap meet and make a weekend out of it.

I was just wondering if there was any talk of doing that again.  Sorry
for the confusion,
