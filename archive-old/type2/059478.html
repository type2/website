Subject: to make things overly clear - engine number question
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

They asked me this stuff when I went for parts to rebuild my engine with.

My engine number:  H103023X

My guess: 1967, 1500cc

My question: what is the X all about and why is there no zero after the H?

And how did it get in the back of my 1979 camper (. . . I wonder)?

Thanks,
Christopher
