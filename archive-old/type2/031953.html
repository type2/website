&gt;The exhaust system: 1st thing I notice the EGR adjuster arm

&gt;No big deal, I get a new one $30, no tube thing through the tin
&gt;to the exhaust? shrug? local VW mech (from the PO's records) had
&gt;replaced/done something not clear to the exhaust system ~ 2 years
&gt;ago.  I stop by (not with a lot of trust and convidence and their
&gt;ability or workmanship or honesty) he tells me he !often  takes
&gt;that out and welds over a patch helps 2.0l's pass emmision 
&gt;test.   Here come the questions: 1st does it really help it pass
&gt;emission test? is he pull my leg ? isn't it illegal for a mech to
&gt;alter the emission stuff?

You don't say where you are, but here in California the smog shops are 
supposed to check for proper functioning of the EGR valve.  No proper 
function = no pass.  The EGR is supposed to introduce inert gas (exhaust) 
into the engine, cooling it and reducing NOx emissions, but they don't 
test for NOx right now, only proper EGR function.  Yes, I would think it 
would be illegal to alter the emission stuff. 

&gt;2nd missing, my muffler gets a whole, no
&gt;big deal, I order a new one from bus depot right year wrong muffler.
&gt;Seems my exhaust system has been replaced with something from a
&gt;previous vintage, i.e. no cat converter. Flange on new muffle not
&gt;same, new muffler really long. However, parts place wants BIG $$
&gt;restocking fee plus I have to pay for shipping, I cut the old flange
&gt;off and weld it to new muffler blot it on, a little paint and viola.
&gt;But, is this legal?  Am I toast next time I have to do emission test? 

You're supposed to have a functioning muffler, though I don't think it 
has to be &quot;original equipment.&quot;  Having no catalytic converter when 
you're supposed to have one will get you flunked real fast here in 
California.  Can't say about your locality.
