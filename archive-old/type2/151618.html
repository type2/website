Subject: Pouring oil the &quot;right&quot; way

Ok, this may be like REALLY obvious, but I have never seen anyone pour oil
into an engine the &quot;right&quot; way. Plastic oil containers usually have the
pour spout offset to one side. Most people open a container of oil and
pour it with the spout down to get as close to the engine oil intake as
possible. Down meaning, on the bottom if the container is 90 degrees
sideways. Problem is, you get the glugs, sometimes with oil all over your
engine.  Is it just me, or do others pour oil in with the spout up? No
glugs! If you have ever had a beer from a glass boot, you'll understand
the physics. :-) Always drink with the toe of the boot facing down and you
won't get soaked. Anyhow, just curious how others do it.
