Subject: Oil Temp Gauge: The Wiring and Such

Howdy All --
Well, I finally acquired my VDO oil temp gauge and sump plate sender to go
with my 914 sump plate.  Now that that's off my plate, now comes the
install stage.  And of course, a couple of questions after a marathon,
unsuccessful perusal of the archives....

(1) The wiring instructions for the gauge seem straightforward enough, but
I'm still blindly feeling my way around electrically.  In addition to
obvious wires coming from both sender and ground, it says the gauge needs a
wire from a +12V source (&quot;usually the fuse box&quot; it says) and a wire from
the light switch.  The provided diagram shows both of these wires coming
from different spots on the fuse box directly to the gauge; it also shows
these wires coming out of the other side of the fuse box and respectively
leading to &quot;Switched +12V&quot; (shows a picture of a key in the ignition) and
&quot;Light Switch&quot; (shows a picture of a -- you guessed it -- light switch). 
This is where I need help.  Does this mean that I need to somehow tap
directly into the fuse box with these wires (and how do I do that), splice
into existing wires already there, or what?  Are there specific fuse
locations that I should/shouldn't use for these connections?  I've never
dealt with fuse box wiring like this before, so if anyone can walk me
through it (or just give me the basics or some words of wisdom), I would be
eternally grateful.  

(2) I also picked up one of those single-hole rubber &quot;safety brackets&quot; to
mount in.  I was thinking of putting it under the dash.  Has anyone ever
used some type of velcro setup to successfully connect the bracket to the
underside of the dash?  Any other non-drilling approaches?

Thanks in advance for your help!  Cheers...
