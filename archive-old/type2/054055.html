Subject: Paint code for orange 73 Westy ?

Hi Volks

I am sprucing up my daily driver and am in need
of a close match to the original orange.
Before I go to the local FLAPS and stand in the sun with the color chip book,
I am hoping someone already has
a PPG,ACME, or whatever brand paint code that they have
used and were happy with ?

Thanks in advance
Don
