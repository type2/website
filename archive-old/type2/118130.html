Subject: 73up steering box on an earlier bay

for real? what a dream come true. late bay steering boxes are on extended
siesta around here. they're thinking they never have to work again. couple
times now i heard they can be substitued for 68-71's and i wonder who has
that down procedure and if any on the list have done it with success. my 68
is really crying out for one soon.  - steve
