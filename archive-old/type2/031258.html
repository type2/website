&gt; Being Friday and all, I though I'd ask about a bus my father saw on
&gt; the NYS thruway a few weeks ago and told me about.  It is a bay window
&gt; with a the top 1/2 of a bug body welded to the roof, facing backwards.
&gt; This is the best  I can get from my father so details could be wrong.
&gt; It was south of Albany but north of NYC, I'd  guess closer to Albany.

your dad isn't crazy, I've seen it too, but can't offer anymore info, he
was heading one way and I the other on the interstate, think I saw it in
NJ, it was a while ago and at night
