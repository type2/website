Subject: Re: [T2] Anyone got a rpm limiting rotor?


&gt; &gt; Looking for a 5400 or 5800 rev limiting rotor. Does anyone have one
they'd
&gt; &gt; like to sell?
&gt;
&gt; These are truely hard to find. As far as I know they are NLA. The trouble
&gt; is that it is a part that wears out, so there are even fewer of these than
&gt; anything else.
&gt;
&gt; I found one on *-bay some time ago for about $30 bucks. I haven't seen one
&gt; lately though. I put it on when my wife drives the bus, as she is not very
&gt; good with  a stick yet, but is learning. I am unfortunately for you, not
&gt; interested in parting with it.
&gt;
&gt; Good luck finding one. If you find a reliable source, I am sure that many
&gt; of us would love to know about it. THough you may want to order yourself a
&gt; bunch before telling us. ;)
&gt;
