Subject: Distrib ? ('77 westy )

Hey now,
I have a '77 westy,  FI, 2000 engine etc.  I have 2 questions regarding
the distributor, I believe mine is the combo centrifugal vacuum, there
is one vacuum hose. I was told by a mechanic that my distributor is
&quot;backwards&quot; that it is correct type, but # 1 is in the front left, then
#4 is in the front right (front being closest to the front of the bus)
then #3 is rear right and finally #2 is rear left.  

Question #1: Is this possible? Does anyone else know of this type of
setup?

Question #2:  I replaced the rotor and cap, with Bosch (I believe the
distrib to be Bosch), I noticed that there is a bit of &quot;play&quot; in the
metal part that the rotor slides down on to.  The play is that when I
slide the rotor down, and if I twist it gives a bit, so that my points
open or close slightly.  Is this normal? Or is it a sign that I need to
replace the distrib?

Thanks allot,
Scoob
