Don...

You're CRA-zy!  (But that's awesome you drive it that hard).  For some 
reason I get all paranoid driving at oil temps over 225 or 230 F...then 
again, with 70k+ miles and 4-5 cross-country trips without an engine 
failure, I guess I'm ok with that. :-)

So, when did you re-ring the pistons and/or add new heads.  How old is the 
short-block?  Are you running an oil temp gauge?

And yes, I'm with out on the Dakota gauges...way too fugly.

* full disclosure: I had to pull the engine on the &quot;new to me '67&quot; halfway 
across the country because it developed a rod knock...but that engine was 
already on it's way out when I got the bus.

&gt; As most of you guys know, I drive the Guac hard. I treat 4500rpm as my
&gt; redline, and 3/4'ths pedal is my limit except for brief periods (under
&gt; 30 seconds). I've made a few trips from Denver to SoCal and back
&gt; maintaining 80-90mph (indicated). Usually with a few hundred extra
&gt; pounds from either family or cargo or both. Aside from vacuum and
&gt; exhaust leaks, no problems with the engine.
