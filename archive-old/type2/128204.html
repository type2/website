Subject: Re: [T2] Carbs go opposite sides

ok phil, chris, and jason....
 i have looked them over and looked them over and reread the instructions and seems the instructions says they are suppose to pull open..(right now they are pushing open). so some idiot put them on wrong in the (picture) then,,, go figure...
i blew up the picture last night useing imaging on the pc and reread the whole thing again...
so a picture has a thousand words hunh LOL...
a friend is mailing me a uni synch to borrow and as soon as it gets here i will swap them over and phil yep i bet that is the linkage problem...
you know i can take all this as a learning experience and tuck it under my been there hat i guess,...
how was one suppose to know with as little knowledge as i have of the duals and going by the picture... LOL
every seen the bus?? i am a artist(maybe?) so i guess i went by the pic...
so i feel like a real dumb ass now but as said this has been a great task going from the progressive set up..
one thing i did learn... they will run back ass wards..(grins).. just not like they are suppose to...
as soon as the uni synch arrives i plan on starting over..
thank you all keep you updated..
one more thing at least we got something to kick around the fire now for more shits and giggles hehehehe~!~
let shope by oktoberbus that she is right right right... would like to drive right up kings mountain no problems..
peace and love
chris

chris, if your carbs are mounted with the vacuum ports pointing out
(away from the engine) they should be on the correct side.
