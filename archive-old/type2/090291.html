Subject: Re: [T2] question: replacing rear brake shoes

&gt; it in until the star just &quot;pops&quot; out easily. I've tried that, but no luck.
&gt; I'm not real comfortable cranking a bolt in there tighter and tighter
&gt; thinking the star adjuster is just going to pop loose. Can anyone offer
&gt; their experiece with this? Is there another way to try and remove them?

Ive used varied things to get them out. but a pair of 8&quot; channel locks and
grab em and twist back and forth and work them out has done it for real
stubborn ones.
The 2 parts will likely be frozen together so then you can get a serious
grip with pliars and vise grips and get them seperated.
I usually clean them up with the dremel and anti sieze them well.
