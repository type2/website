Subject: brake light senders

    Hi,

My brakes lights are not working. I checked the two senders on the master
cylinder and one of them clearly does not work. The front one works but the
rear one does not. Do both of them need to work for the lights to function?
The bentley is not clear on this and the archives show no evidence of this.

Also, if I replace the sending switch, can I assume that any air that gets
into the cylinder will bubble up into the reservoir? (ie: can I get away
without bleeding the brakes?)

thanks,
Bob
