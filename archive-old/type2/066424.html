&gt;Hey all...
&gt;
&gt;I had a nice piece of mail from Alldata today regarding production of
&gt;an automotive CD to cover aircooled Volkswagens.  Apparently they are
&gt;seriously (thinking of) putting such a CD into production.

Any chance you could forward me a copy of that?

One listmember, John M. Kowalski, wrote up a big letter to the Product
people at Alldata, which I forwarded to the Marketing guys.  Don't ask why
they already didn't have it - I've taken care of that!   (For those of you
who don't know, I'm the SysAdmin for Alldata.)

Anyway, I got a call from the Marketing dude today asking where the letter
came from.  I explained (for the second time) my campaign.  All of a sudden
he's all for it, especially since we are launching our &quot;Consumer&quot; version of
the product shortly.

So, now that we have their attention, its time to hammer the point home.  I
told him it would be ideal to cover the entire air cooled line - thru '79/80
for the bugs, and '82 for the air cooled vanagons.

So, lets get crackin' on those letters!  Its _your_ support thats going to
make it happen!  If enough people show support, it will wake up the
marketing and product people and make this happen!
