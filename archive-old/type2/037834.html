Subject: *WHICH* Hoover Bit????;-)

All,

I've been around this list for a little over 2 years
and I *thought* I knew what a Hoover Bit was....but
from some of the recent posts, I'm no longer so sure!

Now...before anyone gets all huffy-puffy and says to
check the archives; I have. There are references to
*two* completely different items that are *both*
labeled as 'Hoover Bits' 8-/

The first item mentioned, was a piece that attaches
the shroud to the dog house.... I couldn't quite grasp
exactly what was meant by this. Knowing that Bob was
(is still, I imagine;-) a freak about sealing against
any air-leaks, I imagine it was something along these
lines (?).

The second item mentioned (and this is what *I*
thought of as a 'Hoover Bit'), is the threaded
lamp-rod that you use to prevent the metal fuel line
from being worn-through by the cooling shroud.

So....which is it??? And does anyone have any photos
of the first 'Hoover Bit' listed above??? Can someone
tell me exactly what it does???
