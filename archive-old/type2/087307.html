Subject: Re: [T2] muffler installation prolem

Do you have a new German Muffler or South American.  I made the mistake on trying to put a cheapo Brazilian Muffler on an old bus I had and it Simply would not fit. It looked right, was the right part number, but it was off just enough to be a huge PITA. Took it back and exchanged it for the more expensive german part, and it went right on. Guess where I get all my parts now? FWIW
Peace, John Baker

I am having some problems installing my muffler to my heat exchangers.  Can not seem to get the muffler all the way on.  Almost seems like it's bent.  Can anyone give me any advice on the installation?  I checked my manuals, and consulted the list library, but didn't fid anything on fitting the muffler to the exchangers, except the section on welding flanges.  I would like to try to fit it without doing that.  Get more from the Web.  FREE MSN Explorer download : http://explorer.msn_dot_com
