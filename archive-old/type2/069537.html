Thanks for the info, good people.  It appears that the REAL problem is in the 
Eberspacher's pump (and maybe other things.

Incidentally, this is my second '75 (the first now has a partial engine-otomy 
underway--it got too hungry one day and ate a valve).  On this, the air flow control, 
fuel injectors, brains and everything had been replaced by a Weber carb.  Cool.  On 
the Goose (number 1), a faulty air sensor, leaking injectors, and sundry other 
problems accounted for a trip over the Rockies at 30 mph a year ago, and THEN added 
insult by scarfing up more than most of a kilobuck in a Western shop to get running 
again.

Thanks again for your help!
