Subject: Re: insurance--Great Rates

I use USAA too, great rates ($680/year), I agree and they have good 
coverage too, we have used the towing and labor quite a few times. But if 
you have historic tags you go to a company that covers only historic 
innsurance and you get better deals, this is what I plan to do in the 
next week or two when I change my plates over. They know where you're 
coming from they only deal in old cars, and base the rates on the value 
of your car/bus, the value you think it is, not what the blue book says. 
This coverage is fire, theft, liability, collision, it's good coverage, 
they know how much people baby their cars, I hug my bus every day and 
give her a compliment, cause she once got gelous of my girlfriend and 
threw a rod.
