Subject: Leaded gas

&gt; the lead was a part of the Valve lubricant or something I heard but I have
&gt; been told that the VW engines have not needed lead since about 1970.

I don't believe that statement is true. It might be that type 4 engines or
possibly all engines in US spec buses can cope without lead. The type 1
engines of the seventies were not intended for unleaded (or LPG for that
matter).
The heads need to be replaced if you still have the original ones. One tank
of leaded on 3 unleaded was recommended at some point in time. That should
keep enogh lead on the heads to keep it going. Leaded gas is now being
phased out in Europe.  Currently many stations still sell unleaded with lead
replacement but that is also being phased out. Now you have 3 options:

1-  Use unleaded with an additive that you put in your tank yourself.
2-  Do the head swap now.
2-  Use unleaded and run your engine into the ground because you want a
rebuild anyway.
