Subject: P &amp; C on the Road

The engine and trans are back in the double cab and we are headed out 
for points east.  Taking the 68 this year, driving in comfort.

First stop is Seligman Arizona to help out friends this weekend but we 
will be heading off to Oklahoma for a family reunion the following 
weekend.  From then until mid July when the other family reunion starts 
in Texas we will be wandering in the central US area, where ever bus 
events and other adventures take us.

We will be unsubscribing to the lists but pmail us if you know of a VW 
event or other fun thing.  Watch for us down the road.
