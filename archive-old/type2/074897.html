Subject: Tricks

&gt; #1. Go for inspection with a new oil change.
&gt; #2. Get fresh fuel if the van has been sitting or has any additives in the
tank.
&gt; #3. Run it hard at 50-60 MPH for fifteen or twenty minutes and get it good
and hot.
&gt; Those are the tricks I know.


I once gave a used car dealer some free advice, and by way of reciprocation,
he told me that when they were trying to unload a car with a smoky engine,
they put high temp cooking oil in it, usually Crisco.  Had a chuckle over
that, but did not go to him for my next car.

Regards,

Grant
