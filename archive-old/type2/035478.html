Subject: Westy sink/icebox unit questions

Volks:
Hope everyone is handling the wintry weather.  I'm bored to tears. 
Don't have to go to work and it's too nasty to work on my bus:(

So I thought I'd rehab my sink/icebox unit.  It turns out I'm missing
several things:

Water fill tube and cap for water tank.

Drawer under sink (so Bently says..I've never seen one)

Ice drain tray (never seen one of these either).

Also, the hinges on the workspace table (the one that flips over the
sink) seem to be bent.  It wont lie flat either way.  Does this rest on
something?   Does anyone have pictures of the above drawer and ice
tray.  I could probably fashion something.  

I have a bookmark for a Westy owner's manual on the web somewhere, but
it's at work. Anyone have the URL?

Thanks

BTW is there still a bus chat somewhere?
