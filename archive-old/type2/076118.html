Subject: Valves Question on 2000cc motor

------=_NextPart_000_008E_01C15626.71392140
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I have a '73 Bus with a '76 previously fuel injected 2000cc motor. When =
the '76 motor was put in my Bus, the original dual carbs were used in =
place of the fuel injection system. I am about to perform my first valve =
adjustment on my Bus and am not sure what the proper valve clearances =
are for this motor and how to find TDC. I have read conflicting numbers =
in different reference books.=20

My first question is whether my motor has hydraulic lifters or not. I =
was under the impression that '78 and later motors had hydraulic =
lifters. Is this correct?

Secondly, what should I be setting the intake and exhaust valves at?=20

Third....how do I find TDC? I am used to setting valves on a Type 1 and =
know how to line up the pulley mark with the split in the case seam. =
Where do I line up the pulley mark on the 2000cc motor? I can't seem to =
find an obvious split in the case.=20

Sorry for all the dumb questions. This is my first Bus and I'm still =
learning all the ins and outs.

Please email me directly at giddyup98_at_earthlink_dot_net if you can help.

Thanks,
Larry
