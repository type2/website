Subject: '74 cab door panels
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hi all, 

I have a '74 Single cab, it has the door panels with the ventilation 
grilles in the lower rear corner of the door. I want to purchase new 
panels, and would like to fit the earlier panels that come without 
openings for these grilles. 

I would like to know if the '68 to '72 cab door panels would fit the
later doors, any info on this would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Brian.
