Subject: Re: [T2] Is the end near? Few VW buses seen at premier hippie
  gathering!

I forgot to mention yesterday that when we ran the Calif coast tour,
Hwy 36 to Hwy 1 down to LA we found a VW bus camped at nearly every
turnout in the Big Sur area. Quite a few in the Mendicino / Ft Bragg
area too.

 Oregon Country Fair, eh? I was just down the road on the Oregon Coast
 (Florence) that weekend, and there were a few busses on the 101. There
 was a nice maroon splitty (waved) and 2 white bays (both waved). In
 fact, there was another bus camping at Honeyman SP one of the nights we
 were there while the fair was going on. I saw them pulling in, but the
 park was too big - I couldn't find them. I guess in answer to your
 question, there are plenty of them around Oregon. But, the numbers are
 dropping here too.
