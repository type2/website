Subject: have i been screwed?
Message-Id: &lt;v04011701b399abf0ba39_at_[4.16.26.41]&gt;

...I suspect i have. I just had the front brakes [pads and rotors] replaced
in my '71 westy, and it cost a fortune. Since i'm more or less in the
middle of nowhere, and i have to leave tomorrow to be back on the east
coast in time, i sucked it up and paid for them. $184/rotor, just for the
rotor. this didn't include the pads, labor or tax! is this even close to a
correct price? In my '95 jetta rotors only cost about $90, just last
summer. If it's really ridiculously off, i'm going to raise a stink, since
i had it done at a large chain.

thanks,
