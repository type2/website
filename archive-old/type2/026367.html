	Hello List,
Not so recently, I was perusing a VW Mag and noticed a kit being sold for
the venerable pre-disk brake transporter that retained the large 5 lug bolt
pattern, yet used 911 rotors and calipers.  I only saw this ad once, and it
was never to be seen again.  The kit was about $1000, and I was looking
forward to seeing it installed sometime when all mention of it dropped from
the face of the Earth.  Does anyone out there remember seeing this kit,
either on ad or on a vehicle?  It is the one 'necessary' upgrade I would
like to tackle, and I want to retain the stock bolt pattern as per the
advertisement.  Any info will be greatly appreciated!

	Eron
