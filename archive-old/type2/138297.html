Subject: [T2] Bob Hoover - off topic - sort of

I'm listening to some vintage Paul Harvery episodes while I work. 

He's got one episode all about Bob Hoover... 

This Bob Hoover is/was quite a pilot. 

Is that the same Bob Hoover that used to educate us here so often at Type 2? I sure learned alot from Bob. 

Whatever happened to him? I remember the high emotions though I don't remember the causes. 

Thanks. 

Chris and all,

Be aware that there are two &quot;Bob Hoovers&quot;.  OUR Bob Hoover is a pilot and a VW guru.  The other Bob Hoover is a Mustang jockey (a yellow mustang!) and a stunt pilot and I'm sure the guy Paul Harvey was talking about.  He was also grounded because of his age and medical conditions.
