Subject: RE: [T2] FI harness repair

&gt;- do nothing and wonder why the FI is acting up in a few years like the
D-Jet folks

How NOT to clean an FI harness:

In 1997 when I removed the dual Webers to re-install the original FI on my
74 914, I cleaned the VERY greasy harness with carb cleaner.  It worked
great and the harness looked like new when I was done, but DO NOT DO THIS!!
I've seen many other harnesses in recent years (including the one on my 73
Westy and 76 914) and NONE of them are anywhere near as crackly and brittle
as the one I had cleaned with carb cleaner.  So I have to summize that using
carb cleaner was a very very very bad idea.
