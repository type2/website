Subject: 72 bus for trade
Date: Fri, 19 Mar 1999 01:23:47 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I have a 72 bus in SC that I would like to trade for a T-1 or T-3 of any
year or model. The van is a hard top camper but is missing the camper
interior. The body is in good shape with the only rot in the lower doglegs.
The rockers are good and all four corners are good. It also has both
bumpers. The bus is now sporting a 2litre that can go with the bus or not
depending on the trade.
thanks
