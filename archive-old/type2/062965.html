Subject: Rumba Survives Hurricane Fran

hey now,

Well, i survived the trip home from work Friday night. it was very interesting.
i don't know how fast the winds were blowing but i got home about 1:00am and
the hurricane came through about 3am or 4am. didn't really need the wipers
because the rain was horizontal. kinda cool. the bus did well.._dot_usual
wind problems. i was on i-40 where there are 6 lines to both sides. i was
in the far left lane because i knew i'd get blown a bit. had the road pretty
much to myself. bus was being rocked a bit..all of a sudden a VERY strong
gust blew me from the far left to the far right...across two lanes of
the highway. all i could do was hang onto the steering wheel. never felt
anything like it. then when i was in raleigh..i saw a large branch FLY
in front of me. weird. turned down clark street. wind was getting really
strong. i drove under a large pine in time to see it starting to fall just
as i passed. whew. drove in the driveway, ran into the house, got soaked in
about 10 seconds.

luckily, amanda and i and the house didn't have any damage. about 4 feet of
water in the basement, which we siphoned out yesterday buy filling a hose
up at the spiget, then sticking it in the basement under water. put the other
end down a hill in the backyard. slow but it got rid of all but 2 inches of
water. still no power, maybe none till wednesday. there's a bug across the
street that got crushed by a lare oak? tree. hurts to look at it.

no time to look rumba's sticky parking brakes. since it's dried up, we've had
no problems though. spend saturday and sunday looking for ice and water to no
avail. found beer though.

take care,

jonathan
