&gt; One last bit. It seemed to take forever to drive the 600 miles down
&gt; there. In fact the Odometer only said 530 miles (right size tires too).
&gt; So on the trip up I used mile markers to compare. The speedo had been
&gt; making some clicks every once and a while but I never realised it was
&gt; every mile! At about the .4 mark the numbers would stop and hold  and
&gt; then there was a click and it moved on. Blast! thats why. No wonder the
&gt; mileage was a bit low too. 

--&gt;  I had the same problem, except at .3.  Your odometer gear is
cracked, wedging against the gear it meshes with, and slipping on the
shaft.

I solved this by taking out the speedometer and removing the damaged gear
-- it'll slip right off the shaft.  I put some epoxy in it, then slid it
onto the shaft, and wound copper wire tightly around the gear's hub to
pull the cracked portion together.  Added a little epoxy to the wire, so
it'd stay put forever.  That fixed the slipping.  Now, because the crack
had spread a couple of the teeth a little, the gear was still wedging
against the one it meshes with.  So, I filed the teeth on either side of
the crack.  Little bit at a time, with an emery board, where it was
interfering. Every so often I'd run the thing up a mile by hand, turning
the speedo input shaft, to check my progress.  Eventually I got it to the
point where it meshed okay, and put it back in the van.  It's worked great
since. 

Unexpected benefit:  My speedometer bobbles less.  The wedged gear was
putting a lot of tension on the cable.
