Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for brake caliper

Courtney,

It is all about heat dissipation.

The less heat there is, the better the brake works. Brake fluid works best
at &quot;room temperature&quot; so to speak, so the cooler you can make the brakes the
less &quot;brake fade&quot; you have.

If you have raced a sports cars or towed a trailer downhill, you know what I
am talking about. The brakes can get very soft after prolonged or repetitive
braking. On a tow vehicle, the brake fluid can actually &quot;boil' and you can
lose all braking power. (Which happened to me once, but that is a different
story).

On a motorcycle where the rotor and caliper are exposed to the ambient air,
you would see much less of a difference in a cross-drilled rotor. But,
enclose the caliper in a wheel assembly like a car, and you will see the
difference. It becomes a little convection oven.

Cross-drilling rotors makes a huge cooling difference in positive braking
performance and brake-fade resistance in trucks and vehicles. It allows the
heat to be swept away from the inside out.

I don't think grooving the pads would provide much of an improvement, since
grooves in pads are mostly there to let brake dust escape. But you are
correct, in motorcycles it is to save weight, which sacrifices some
friction.

Jon
