&gt; Man- Look at CIP's website. They only list 2 sizes, one for early and one

&gt; so many complaints about cables being too long. They've cut it down to 2
&gt; generic lengths that aren't really right for anything? Tom

Bus Depot and Rocky Mountain &quot;claim&quot; to have all the sizes

if you have an automatic you better get the right size because it has a
special little clevis on the end where it hooks to the tranny.
