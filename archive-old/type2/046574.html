Subject: [T2] TGIF/VW sightings

Hey all...
             Just saw &quot;Almost Famous&quot;...to get the feeling of 1972, it has
been populated with many VWs--bugs and busses alike...but it seems the prop
department could only find about five that they liked...subsequently, these
same five show up all over the place, even when the scenes are (supposedly)
in different cities...keep an eye on the dark green splitty with the white
plastic after-market air-scoops (did they even make those in the early
'70s??)...the good news is-- NONE of these VWs was spewing smoke :)
             Bus content: the engine comes out on Monday to diagnose the
tranny grind/whrrrrr...taking bets as to the cause---throwout bearing or
pilot bearing?...place yer bets...
                                                                        &quot;2
cylinder&quot; Snave
						1974 Westy
