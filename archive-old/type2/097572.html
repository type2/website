Hi Richard,

    Is that considered a &quot;Three Dog Night&quot;? :-)   Read somewhere that the
group got there name from the fact that you could tell how cold it was in
the outback, by the amount of dogs you had to cuddly up to stay warm. So
&quot;Three Dog Night&quot; must be pretty cool, right? Ok, Ok, pun intended!
    Fact or fiction? The phone lines are opened!

&gt; Hey Chris, bring your westy to Brisbane and you can camp in winter when it
&gt; might get down to 10degC on a cold night ;-).
