At home I use a brass drift on the end of the axle with the inner CV
supported in the jaws of a big vise.  On the road, the plan is to use a
brass hammer judiciously on the inner CV.  I've not had to do it this
way, but I'm pretty sure that it would work.   Lots of little taps will
defeat the beast!
