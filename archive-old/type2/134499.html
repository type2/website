Subject: [T2] power coating

Any electric dryer or electric range plug will work for your oven.
You only need to heat to 450 degrees to get liquefaction of the powder
materials.
The prep is very important and you'll need to blast with sand or other (not
glass bead) to get a bonding surface.
You may also want to pre-burn the parts you intend to coat to cook out the
penetrated contaminates in the metal.
You may also want to wipe all the parts down with toluene or other non
petroleum cleaner before you apply the powder coating.
Prep is very important in getting good results on the first try.
