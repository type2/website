Subject: Does the grim reaper drvie a bus

Glen,

I have had five busses over the years. 
I always thought that if I got hit that was it.  But my brother crash tested 
my 71 and my 72.

The 71 he rolled on it side then three weeks later they flipped three times 
on the freeway.  They drove it away both times.

Now for the 72 this get better _at_ pox 45 mph he hit an Opal Manta that was 
park that went into a rabbit that jump the curb and into a fence.  The front 
end did not come in on them.  So they can take hit.

Also I have never a problem in the snow or on sick road with the bus.
But I have seen more than SUV on it side.

I to would like to know as much about there safety.

Chris
