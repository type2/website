&gt; luckely a friend had a Type fot CU 2.0 lt more, and
&gt; sold it to me. a bargain. now i'm trying to change the
&gt; 4 spd to a five 094 speedbox T25 engine. Everybody
&gt; tell me I'm nuts. Am I wrong? I found a lot of good
&gt; gentle people says no way. Why?

actually the question should be &quot;why do you want to??&quot;

there is no significant advantage to a five speed in a bus.   and the 094
gearbox is not as tough as the bus 4 speed.  remember this is a 4000lb
truck we're talking about. the Type 4 engine is not a racing engine
(unless it is a 914 version) it is a torquey (is that a word) low speed
hauler...  unless you plan to race your bus. I would still ask &quot;Why?&quot;
