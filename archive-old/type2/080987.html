Subject: Re: [T2] Simple(!) Horn Question

My memory may be slightly fuzzy on this issue--and I'm not going to start
tearing things apart to be certain--but my recollection is this:

The ground circuit is completed from the horn via a wire that goes down
through the center of the steering column and, on my bus anyway, is grounded
by being attached to one of the two bolts that hold the steering column
cover plate.

The wire visible underneath the steering box is the hot wire from the horn,
which connects to a male connecter accessible underneath that connects to
the steering column. The steering column is hot. When the horn button is
depressed the steering column is grounded, completing the circuit and
sounding the horn.

Cheers,

Subject: [T2] Simple(!) Horn Question


I'm trying to make my horn work.  I understand the basic concepts involved
here, especially with regard to the horn button completing a ground circuit.
If I get under the bus beneath the steering box, I see the wire that
completes the ground circuit when you push the button, but I can't seem to
figure out where this wire is supposed to connect to.  There is a female
spade terminal on the wire, where does it connect?
