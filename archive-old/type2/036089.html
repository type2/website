Subject: stripped plug

Greetings..

I've got a stripped spark plug hole in my #1 cylinder.  I am planning on
pulling the engine this weekend to work on this, but have a decision to
make.  I haven't done a compression check, but when I purchased the bus a
couple years ago, all cylinders were at 120-130.  My question is:  Should I
install a thread insert into the one cylinder, or pull all the P&amp;Cs off and
install new ones?  I already have the P&amp;Cs, but don't know if that's just
overkill and a whole lot more work than necessary.

Any suggestions or thoughts on what to do?  And since I've got the engine
out, is there anything else to check out?  I think I've also got to pull my
fuel tank to replace a faulty sender.  What fun for the weekend.

Cheers,

Tom
