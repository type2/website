Subject: Re: [T2] VW Material??

lmao!

it seems to me (and correct me if i am wrong) that it is only &quot;illegal to
use a logo for the purpose of making profit&quot;, so if one uses the emblem
to paint their own walls, decorate their own clothing or curtains, etc,
it would be fine (as long as they NEVER sell it!) so *PTH!!!*

smiling and waving a peace sign (minus a finger) at VWoA,
