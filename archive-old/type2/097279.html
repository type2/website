Subject: RE: [T2] Red rubber dual intake manifold gaskets

Yes there should be a gasket for the breather.  Get a can of carb
cleaner and spray lightly on all your vacuum areas.  Increase in rpm
means you have a leak where you applied carb cleaner.  Don't forget the
injector seals too.  Also, another one that haunted me for a bit was the
throttle body gasket where in attaches to the intake air manifold.  Good
luck.

Is the breather itself supposed to have some gasket on
it?
