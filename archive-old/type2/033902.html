Oh, and one more thing. If you aren't willing to help Dawn out because 
you don't like her business practices, don't you dare watch &quot;Wonderful 
Life&quot; and get all choked up this Christmas. 'Cause you are Potter, not 
George Bailey.


Standard disclaimer: I don't know Dawn. I don't think I have ever known 
anyone named Dawn.
