has  anyone put a sunroof in a bay west top? I'm thinking of a  
smaller,  flush-mounted hatch with a clear glass cover. The Vanagon  
westy's  had a webasto runroof option from the dealer and I am  
thinking it  would be a nice addition to a bay in order to improve  
ventilation  when parked or in transit. Sure works well in the  vanagon!





Hey Greg  I don't see why you couldn't find a sunroof from a vehicle  that 
has the same curvature as your bus and graft it in. 
Bring some of that good beer you  Ca nooks (sp) deprive us less  fortunate 
yanks and I'd help you install it.. (best results before the drinking  
starts)...lol
