Subject: Sorry

Didnt mean to put you on the defensive. It was more airsuckers post that i
thought was a little ridiculas ya know. Why bitch about the thread and then
add to it and then answr the same ? that everyone else had answrd. thats
all. You rock though/ I looked at your site. I have the same deal with my
friends also.
&quot;what do you see in that thing?&quot; As they drive away in thier Sebring. lol No
one can believe there is a list for us and that thier are even clubs such as
neato and limbo. Dam there is a club for everything these days. My fiance
who Ive known for 5 years just found out today that hitler was directly
responsible for the vw. It was in an A&amp;E biography 100 most influential
people of the last cent. He came up (rather close to first I might
add.yikes) and I told her, &quot; all things aside I do have to thank him for one
thing....&quot; cant believe she didnt absorb this info from me earlier? I need
to pull the soap box out more often!!!
take care,
nice meeting you.
Steve
