&gt;
&gt;  The question does make you think for a while. . . . but then my head
&gt; starts to hurt.
&gt;
&gt;  I want to throw a couple ideas out.
&gt;
&gt;  To lower the heat coefficient of anything you would have to decrease
&gt; the density. As in molecules farther apart.
&gt;
No, that jsut makes the substance less dense, it does nothig to the
coeeficient of heat (&quot;specific heat&quot;).  A substance has a specific heat
that is unchangeable, only adding something to it as you described below
will change the rate of heat absorbtion/shedding.

&gt;  If you do that, you will decrease the viscosity.
&gt;
&gt;  It is easily proven with even water that the addition of minerals,
&gt; chemicals, even salt will raise the coefficient of heat in a fluid.
&gt;
&gt;  What I propose is that even this Kendall should have a higher heat
&gt; value.

What do you mean by heat value?  That it should be hotter?  If it absorbs
heat rapidly, it will shed it rapidly too.  

*Extreme Caution - a boring physics lecture follows*

Different materials require different amounts of heat per unit mass to
increase their temperature.  ie adding the same amount of energy (&quot;heat&quot;)
to two different substances will cause them to heat at different rates,
due to their specific heat.  The equation: Q = mc*(delta T), where Q is
the heat input, m is the mass, delta T is the time interval and c is the
specific heat, a higher specific heat means that more energy (Q) is
required for a similar gain in temperature.  

Basically what I'm getting at is the if this Kendall has a higher specific
heat, it will remain cooler while keeping the motor cool as well.  It can
absorb heat (energy) from the cylinders and heads without raising its own
temperature as much as conventional oils.

Any questions?
