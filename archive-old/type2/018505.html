Subject: Looking for a good mechanic/shop Santa Cruz-Big Sur
Message-ID: &lt;37667A67.56FDF249_at_mindspring_dot_com&gt;

Hey all,
Looking for a good mechanic/shop from Santa Cruz on the north end, Big
Sur to the south and Salinas to the east.  This weird problem has got me
concerned and with all the details of moving 2500 miles and being behind
on work, I decided that I want to take it in and have the work done for
me.  I have searched the yellow pages, found a couple places that work
on VW aircooled, but would prefer to use someone that others on the list
have had good experience with. Thanks,
Scoob
