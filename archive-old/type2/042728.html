&gt;you can not install a sending unit into the sump and get an accurate reading

It's not perfect, but it's much better than nothing.  I have run a sump
sender/gauge combo for over ten years and have been very happy with the
data I've received from it.  Also, it doesn't measure the temperature at
the edge of the sump - it measures it in the main sump near the oil-to-air
boundary, i.e. the surface of the oil in the sump.  It's the factory
location for the Porsche 914, which tells me that many engineers thought it
was a useful place to measure oil temperature.  And it's not like the oil
is sitting there stagnant and mossy in the sump - it is constantly getting
churned up and flung around by the motion of the crank and rods spinning at
3600 rpm.  A lot of it is flung up to the undersides of the pistons and the
cylinder walls, which is probably the hottest metal the oil ever comes into
contact with.

&gt;Mounting the sending unit on the suction side of the pump in the main oil
&gt;galley is a good spot, but requires some work.

Some work is a bit of an understatement, don't you think?  95% of the bus
owners out there (myself included) do not have the time or money to remove
the engine and tap the case for the possible slight increase in accuracy,
not to mention the risks involved if the sender should fail (possible
instant oil pressure loss) and the reengineering needed to avoid having the
sender obstruct the flow of oil through the galley by protruding into it.

If you're going to go that far, why not put the sender in the best possible
place, i.e. the oil galley right before the main bearings?  That would be
the best place to measure pressure too, I imagine.

Considering everything, I think the sump/dipstick location (they measure at
the same location) is a fine spot for an oil temperature sender.
