Subject: RE: lower bus

Generally there is a tradeoff between comfort and handling.  You can have
one or the other.  If you want a comfortable ride, don't bother lowering
your bus, spend your money on good shocks and improve your handling at the
same time.  OK so this contradicts my first sentence, but money talks.
If you put shorter springs on your bus it won't get any lower but it might
get narrower :)

&gt; I would like the bus set up for comfortable highway driving
&gt; even though I plan on using it as a commuter to work sometimes.
&gt; 
&gt; Next, in looking through catalogs (for suspension parts)
&gt; I've seen lowering kits to &quot;improve handling.&quot; Apparently
&gt; the component that lowers everything is a new, but shorter
&gt; spring.
&gt; Anyone out there have experience or opinions on this?
