Subject: Re: [T2] Re Bus Depot service-BORING

Yeah I'm getting tired of all this bashing. Ron sent me a master cylinder
all the way to Canada and the postage quote on the webpage seemed low, but I
sent my Mastercard no. along so they could charge me. Turns out that Ron
actually absorbed a fair amount of postage to stick to the quoted price, and
I appreciate that. I also check prices pretty carefully and he consistently
comes in at the near best price or best from what I can see.
Also, last time I checked the only guy who was perfect was a fellah from the
Middle East called Jesus. The rest of us are allowed to make the occasional
mistake. So unless you are perfect, let's just allow people like Ron to keep
on providing an excellent service, and let's allow people who aren't happy
to shop elsewhere, ok??
