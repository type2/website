Subject: What size bolt Bumper bracket to frame 68-71


+AD4-These appear to be 3/8+ACI- bolts? Should they not be metric?

on my 79, I have three 17mm bolts, presumably the original correct ones, and
one none metric bolt which I guess somebody has fitted later. I can't
remember the size of this but it turns with an AF socket and the thread is
the same as the others.
