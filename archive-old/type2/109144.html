Subject: Re: [T2] Slip Streaming a Semi on I-95

Just heard on the local news that we had an accident on Interstate 20
involving a car that lost an entire rear tire/wheel that traveled across the
median into oncoming traffic, bounced and hit a Mitsubishi Galant in the
windshield.

The driver of the Gallant survived with minor injuries, but the tire/wheel
managed to take out the entire windshield and bend the leading edge of the
roof back almost all of the way onto the seat backs.  Looked like someone
had pushed their fist into an aluminum soda can.

Yowser!

That tire would have been about bottom edge of the windshield high on my
bay...

... yowser...
