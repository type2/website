&gt; I have a '70 Type 2 with two sets of additional rear marker lights
&gt; directly above the tail lights and side marker lights, and a set of
&gt; front marker lights directly above the front turn signals. The extra
&gt; lights in the rear are red and the set up front is amber. The lenses are
&gt; roughly the size and shape of the back-lights. The rear lights are
&gt; spliced onto the wires for the tail lights. I'm not sure how the front
&gt; set is hooked up. The brand name is &quot;Deitz.&quot;
