Subject: Re: Torque Meister

Mike &amp; the list,

I spoke with Ronnie at Kymco just now and he happened to be the one who
handles their emails.  I forwarded Mike's email to him and he said that
the Torque Meisters are in stock and would be more than happy to fix
Mike up with one.  Mike, look for a return email hopefully soon.
