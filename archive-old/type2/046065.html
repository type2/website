Tim,
it sure could have been preigntion, though i am always
listening for any signs of it and did not hear any up
until right before i heard the rod knock and shut
down.   of course it doesnt take much i know.   as far
as gas is concerned on the trip i tried to always use
the mid grade, 89-92 depending what was available vs
price.  the bus ran great the entire trip (about 4000
miles) with no apparent problems, overheating, etc. 
it developed the rod knock about 3 weeks after we got
home, thank god!  the gas around here is all the 10%
ethanol which i know has been dicussed on the list
lately.   timing was fine, i usually set it to spec
and then retard it slightly, it seems to like it that
way.   compression ratio i do not know seeing i did
not check after replacing pistons/sleeves.   thanks
for the reply.

&gt; that?  What was your compression ratio?  What grade
&gt; gas were you using?  How 
&gt; much advance were you running?
