Greetings to you all,
   This weekend I hope to assemble the bottom end of my stock 2 liter 
engine.  I'm planning on using Permatex Aviation Form A Gasket on the 
split-line, but I've got the &quot; thread in the sealant &quot; method on my mind.  
Have any of you ever done this, and what where your experiences ?  I know 
that method is used on aircraft engines, but there it is expected.  What 
good is it to measure bearing journals to the ten thousandths and then do 
something that will have a measurable, even if small, effect?
   I'd like to hear your thoughts and experiences on this subject as I will 
be assembling the case on Sunday evening.
