Subject: transmission leaking in 73 bus...

I went to replace the shift coupler because of excessive shifting slop and
found out that the transmission is leaking gear oil where the shift shaft
comes out of the front of the transmission (where the coupler connects). It
also seems that the bearing (or whatever) is really worn so the shift shaft
sticking out of the transmission has a fair amount of side to side play.

What's involved in fixing this? Does the transmission need to come out? Does
the transmission need to be taken apart to fix it? I just don't want to get
screwed when I take it into the shop (assuming its not something easy that I
can fix myself).

Thanks!
