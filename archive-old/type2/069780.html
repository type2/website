Subject: Re: clutch cable -- SNAP!

Re clutch cable replacement- yes, it's a bear to deal with the bend in the
clutch tube flexible part- suggest replacing it (the cable will havbe worn
its inside edges, and it won't be rough on new cable)- suggest you put it
back NOT FASTENED TO REAR part and guide cable thru it, then bend it into
place at the tranny connection.  With a well greased NEW one, your should
get thru anyway.  I usually feed some grease in at the far end (use piece
of old cable, because even though you grease the feeding end, but the time
it gets down there, grease will have rubbed off....my two cents...MB
