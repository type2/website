&gt; Evan,
&gt; I had the same problem so.....
&gt; I turned my carb around so the &quot;front&quot; is actually facing the &quot;front&quot; of
the
&gt; bus, then had a spacer made at the local machine shop (about 1/2&quot; thick)
&gt; that goes between the carb and manifold tubing, with the corresponding
hole
&gt; machined quite nicely. This allowed the throttle linkage to move freely.
&gt; Then the accelerator cable fits on the correct side of the car, which is
the
&gt; original place, less wear.
&gt; This has worked quite satisfactorily for me. Oh, I also use a spring
&gt; attached to the throttle linkage, going to the rear of the bus so that the
&gt; mechanism returns to the idle position properly.
&gt; I use the spring from my old stock dual carb system. Works just fine.

&gt; Subject: [T2] carb problems
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Hello All.  I have recently installed a 1700 engine in my bus that is
&gt; running
&gt; &gt; a progressive webber carb. My problem is that the linkage for the carb
hit
&gt; &gt; the bottom of the intake  abd won't allow the second barrel to kick in.
&gt; any
&gt; &gt; suggestions? also another problem I'm having is trying to hook the
&gt; &gt; accelerator cable up. My bus was originally a FI so im wondering how I
can
&gt; &gt; hook the accelerator cable up as the linkage on the carb is about in the
&gt; &gt; center of the rear tin where there is no holes. any  help is muchly
&gt; &gt; appreciated as this is keeping Dupree from the road again.
&gt; &gt;
