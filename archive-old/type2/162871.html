Subject: Re: [T2] Blueprinted

Thanx Dave for defn &amp; discussion.  I never heard this term 
&quot;blueprinting&quot; till 2 or 3 decades ago, and have always been 
suspicious of it.  I suspect extreme fixation on numbers is the last 
refuge of those who lack intuition (and want an excuse for charging 
more).   Burt 'the World's Fastest Indian' Munro had few instruments; 
his home-made &quot;micrometer&quot; for measuring piston slap was a long wedge 
viz. a hand-filed knitting needle.

&gt;
&gt;If you could simply pick a set of pistons which were made perfectly,
&gt;would you expect to pay extra for that selection process?

	Several corporations were charging the Pentagon $5 for a $0.5 
diode selected I can't recall how but it did cost labour and looked 
to have a better life expectancy than an unselected diode.
	For a motor peaking as low as 4000 rpm, with low specific 
power, I doubt exact equality of piston weights would make much 
difference.
