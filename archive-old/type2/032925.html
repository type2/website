Ah, the dreaded lurching... :( and a favorite of unscrupulous mechanics who
will start replacing one piece of fuel-injection equipment after another in
decreasing order of cost (first the ECU --which is generally fine--, then
AFM, and so forth...)

Check your fuel filter first, or rather its contents: pour them into a pan
and look for rust particles from the fuel tank and perhaps perls of water.
None of the above? Then it may be an intermittant electrical problem, either
in the ignition or in the fuel injection. Check all connections for positive
contact. Sometimes male and female connector from the head temp sensor don't
connect properly and it's hard to see because they're hiding under a nylon
sleeve. Check all ground connections, replace points and *condensor*, and
perhaps also the coil if nothing else has seemed to work.

Another method, if you're desperate, is to let the engine idle, then wiggle
the wires and the wire harness in hopes of replicating the problem...

Good luck,

Sami
