Subject: Re: Octane -- vs. RON

WTF

  I followed the Octane subject matter not the Gas. If subjects aren't real
specific I don't always read them. If the subject line changes on the same
thread it makes it more difficult to follow. Octane grabbed my interest,
Gas did not. Which one is more specific? The one post I did read used RO
and MO. I wasn't sure if RO meant RON or what. 
  Sorry, but I do not have the time or patience to read every post that
comes my way.
