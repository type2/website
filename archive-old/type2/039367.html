Subject: Carb Rebuild Web Page

Sometime ago someone mentioned they wanted to make some web pages that
dealt with rebuilding carbs.

Well I just finished rebuilding mine.  I also has the use of a digital
camera, thanks to work.  I took pictures of every step along the way.  I
also just happen to have completed a web developement class, which
tought me many neat tricks of web page writting.

Well I tried it out and this is what I came up with

http://users.erols_dot_com/jarvi/vw/rebuild.html

So please have a look at it and I'm open to comments.  Right now it only
discusses reassembling the passanger side of my 72 westy.  Eventually it
will cover disassembly and reassembly of both sides, and cleaning.

Those who have rebuilt carbs please verify the steps are correct and I
have not missed and of the steps, or any suggestions to calrify the
descriptions.

I write this and used Netscape 4.7 to check it.  I have opened it up in
IE 4 and it seems to work also.  But beyond that I can make no comments.

Brent
