That test was a negative for me Don, same result. Thank you for the
suggestion though. I guess I will try replacing the points again and see
if that helps.

	Would you care to give more detail about how you did that
	Don, either pmail or list.


Just use a wire from the battery positive to the coil positive. I have a
16 gauge wire with alligator clips on either end I use for
troubleshooting. Works perfect for this.

My symptoms were exactly as you described. I did the same thing,
checking and testing every component. Finally one day when I was showing
off the GWB to my boss it wouldn't start. For giggles I ran around back
and hooked up the jumper. Fired right up and ran solid.

It's just such an easy test it's part of my standard diagnostics now.
