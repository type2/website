&gt; 5. I've got a floor jack, but no stands. I'm planning on doing one side at a
&gt; time. Do I really need to buy a set of stands for this?

Possibly not. But first, ask yourself a few questions:
1  Do you feel LUCKY ?
2. Is your blood type TATTOOED on your forehead and ankle ?
3. Do you have a &lt;insert favorite body part &gt; you don't NEED ?
4. Do you have a WILL ?
Why did you ask this question ?
Perhaps you should reconsider doing your own repairs.
Here's the Bentley suggestion:
&quot;Never work under a lifted car unless it is supported on stands
designed for the purpose. Do not support the car on cinder blocks.
Never work on a car that is supported solely by a jack.&quot;
&quot;If you are going to work on a car on the ground, make sure the
ground is level. Block the wheels to keep the car from rolling.
Disconnect the battery negative terminal to prevent others from
starting the car while you are under it. &quot;

Use cheap inferior unstable stands and try to kid yourself.
Give the bus a real good push and see if it drops.
If money is a problem , then BORROW some GOOD jack stands.
&lt; end rant &gt;
