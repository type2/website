Subject: [T2] Expensive lesson?

Good Friday all...
         Pulled my engine (alone) last night and had a difficult time of
it--got hung up on the driveshaft on the way out--pressure plate seems to be
fine, but there is some play in the driveshaft now (&quot;1/4)...&lt;eek!&gt; have I
just learned an expensive lesson? 
Eagerly awaiting reply from the collective wisdom...

PS Thnx for the new engine Dave!
