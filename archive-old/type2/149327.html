Subject: Swapping transmissions

Hi Volks,

My bus is popping out of fourth gear a lot more than I would prefer.  
(A little of that goes a long way, but this is more than a little).   
I have a line on a known good low-milage three-rib tranny from a 71  
bus. I am currently using a high-milage 3-rib from a 1973 bus.

Is the prep for the swap as simple as swapping over the bell housing?


Happy trails,

Greg Potts
