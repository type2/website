Subject: Re: [T2] Ignition wires

Bosch makes a silicon wire for the 1600,s  I had a set on type 1 bugs.  
The spark plug problem sounds like a couple of things.
1.  The plug was to long and the threads that were exposed in the 
cylinder are burnt.  This will cause a tightening feeling as those 
threads get pulled back into the threaded area.

2.  The plug was loose in the threads and ignition gases went up the 
loose thread area.

Turn it back in again and then back out and see if you can get some 
thread lube like WD40 down the threads.

&gt; This time I would like to know if I can use silicon ignition wires in 
&gt; my 1600 DP instead of original cable wires. If the answer is yes what I 
&gt; have to look for in a serach of a good set of them.
&gt; I am almost forgot, I tried to take off the #4 cilinder spark but it 
&gt; was very tight I tried a few turns with my 1/2 socket wrench, but it 
&gt; came harder in ecery turn, so I decied to ask to the list, whats is 
&gt; goingon here and how can I solve.
