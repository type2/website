Howdy folks,

I'll try again.

I have a set of 1700 P&amp;Cs for sale.  I bought them, washed them, then
realized I had 1800 heads.  It was my first rebuild, a total newbie:)  (As
oppossed to the clueless owner I am now:)

Anyway, I oiled them, then bagged each one in a zip lock and stored them.  I
have now use for them, I just looked at them and the are still oily and
ready to be used.  They are cofap brand.

Anyone want them?  They are in Portland, Oregon.  I'll ship them, they are
in their origninal box.
