Subject: [T2] Locked Steering Column, Foiled Theft [long]

Short version:

How do I unlock a locked steering column that no longer has an ignition switch?  
And, given that, what's the easiest way to replace the ignition switch?  Do
I just need to buy one and painstakingly remove my steering column?

The story thus far:

After putting a new engine in my '71, I still had a vacuum leak that I had
to track down, which I thought was in the intake manifold.  Unfortunately,
I had to move out of my house and, not wanting to drive my bus with
a vacuum leak and toast my new engine, I parked it out in front of my 
house and have been working on it when I have the time.  It's a pretty
safe neighborhood, so I figured it would be ok.

Regardless, someone broke into it (apparently the passenger door didn't
lock properly)  and I knew this because they had stolen something off the
front seat and gone through the glove box, but last night when I got my engine 
back together for hopefully the last time in a while, I hopped in and went to
turn the key to find that there was no place to put the key.

In short, my ignition switch has been &quot;cored&quot; (looks like an apple with the core
removed)...my guess is that someone hotwired it, then tried to drive off when
the steering column locked and trapped them against the curb.  They probably
stuck a screwdriver into the ignition and turned it in an attempt to break
the steering column lock, but that didn't work...

So, the question remains:

How do I unlock a locked steering column that no longer has an ignition switch?  
And, given that, what's the easiest way to replace the ignition switch?  Do
I just need to buy one and painstakingly remove my steering column?

I'll probably have AAA tow my bus to my new apartment (now that I have one)
so I can work on it, if they can get it away from the curb far enough, but I guess
I need to know what parts I'll need to get it going again...as it stands, if I could
unlock the column, I could hotwire it myself and drive it there (assuming I've
sorted out my vacuum leak, which I think I have *crosses fingers*), which would
be preferable, but...
