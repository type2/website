&gt;Oh yes, I didn't mention the distributer. To be honest
with you, I cannot tell you what kind it is, but the
numbers on it's body are exactly as follows:
JFUR 4
0 231167014
31905 205T


A couple of problems with your distributor numbers.....
0 231 167 014  comes up as unknown. 014 is wrong.

You are missing something in the beginning of the last number.
The 905 205 part is correct. But the 31 in front is wrong. Should be a 3 digit
number. The T at the end only shows up on a 113 905 205T but that is a 69-70
bug or bus dist. Totally wrong for your 1800 type4 engine. The 113T is for a
1500-1600 upright fan type1 engine.

Please look again.
