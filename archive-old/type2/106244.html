&gt; In both sets, I found that when I
&gt; hooked them to an ohm meter that the resistance was
&gt; infinate no matter if the points were open or closed.

I have to ask: were they Bosch?

&gt; I found that tanking an emery board and inserting it
&gt; between the contacts and sanding them just a little
&gt; bit fixed this problem I was having a heck of a time
&gt; trying to figure out why I was getting no spark when
&gt; everything else in myignition system checked out and
&gt; was getting power. Just make sure to regap the points
&gt; after doing this to make sure the dwell is correct.
&gt; Any way, Have a great day!

As it's been pointed out before the surface of the Bosch points are radiused
and polished.  Granted they don't last at 100% effectiveness for long anyway
but filing new Bosch points isn't a great idea.
