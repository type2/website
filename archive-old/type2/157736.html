Subject: Re: [T2] Save this old bus.

I've gotten an email from another who said Chuck is trying to get that
kind of money.  I'm sorry this is happening.  When he first called a
couple of weeks ago, he was wondering how much he can get.  I explained
that without a title, not much.  I'm hoping not to get too involved, I
was just trying to save an old VW if I could.  Unless a couple of you get
into a bidding war with Chuck over this bus, he was already told by the
junk yard that not to expect much for scap metal.  And as far as the
title, I think he said he was unsuccessful in getting a new title for
it.  Thats why he's scrapping it. The tranny and engine is all there.  I
wish I had a place to keep it, I know there are parts all over it I could
use.  If anyone gets it, let me know.  I need a windshield for my 77'.
Mike
