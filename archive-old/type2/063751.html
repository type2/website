Subject: Re: More '67 Westy minutia items sought

O
&gt; btw, i finally found the ring that the table leg screws 
into for my 65, keep
&gt; on lookiing for yrs!

i _think_ the table thnigie is the same until at least 
1971??
&gt; 
&gt; cant understand what yr #2 zoobie is.

i think RVB is referring to the small &quot;female&quot; brass &quot;catch&quot; 
that sits behind the fold out table. it catches on the back 
of the table (there is a &quot;male&quot; thing it grabs ;) and keeps 
the table from flopping around/rattling while  you are 
driving.

i just got the green canvas thing this weekend that goes 
over the end of the pre' 1968 cot poles while it is being 
stored. How hard are these two find? How does it install, 
believe it or not I am interested :)

BTW Clara what NOS part did Mr. Lukey find?
