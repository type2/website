Subject: Usually, it isn't just one thing

Decided to address my slam-to-close sliding door today. At first, I was 
convinced that the spring in the hinge mechanism was too tight. There 
didn't seem to be enough loss of movement in the gungy hinge pivots to 
account for the difficulty.

When I got the hinge mechanism out of the door, though, and took it 
apart, I could see that a good cleaning was long overdue. That included 
the oil hole that had filled up with dirt. Put everything back together 
and the pivots were smoother, but I still wasn't convinced. So I swept out 
the bottom rail, then sprayed it with WD-40 and scrubbed out lots more 
gunge. Same with the middle track. Put everything back together and the 
door closed without too much effort.

Some wise sage -- I think it was before the list split -- made a speech
about how VW tended not to overengineer everything, or to include
redundant this-and-thats. Instead, the engineering tends to balance finely
all the parts of any system. Now, 20+ to 32 years later, a repair requires
studying all the parts of the system, to see how it all worked together,
originally, in balance. 

Steve Dolan pointed out last week that generalizations about our buses 
often don't pass muster. But here's one that I think is generally true. 
When something in a bus doesn't work right, it usually isn't just one 
thing that's wrong.
