Subject: Head: plug angle??

Hey guys.... wile working on an engine and removing the heads, i was 
amazed to discover that the plugs where located kind of sideway (about 
45deg) instead  of being upward.. this engine is different in many way 
then the normal pancake engine... 

Oil pickup is like the 2.0L Vanagon but straignt up, oil refill is on 
top of the breather, it as solid lifter, hole on top of head for oil 
return, strange adaptor on cooling fan...but my main problem is: plugs 
don't have the same angle as the standard pancake engine!!!!!! so if i 
order 2 new head, plug hole will have to be relocated! It also has a 
&quot;&quot;Moto?????&quot;&quot; single carb?

Porsche engine??? i didn't push my reserch yesterday, as to bore &amp; stoke 
but it seam to me that it's a 1800cc...
of course, both head have dead EX valve seat , guide, valves

I think that engine code is AG

Anyway, can you point me out to a web-site so i can lookout head serial #

Thanks and best regards, Ben
