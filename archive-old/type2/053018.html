Subject: Re: Pop top latches

&gt;Sorry, my previous post about the metal screw pop top hinges apply 
&gt;only to the early pop tops.  Obviously not to the ones with the huge 
&gt;latch in the front center of the poptop.

I have a '76 Westy and am experiencing the billowing. After reading 
the posts this week about various tie-downs I went inside the van to 
mull over it some more. What I ended up doing is wrapping some bungie 
cords around the folding support, this had the effect of pulling the 
top down snug against the seal.

I am off to Los Anglees tomorrow and if the bungie cord works I will 
post some pictures.
