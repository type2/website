Subject: 75 FI bus finally starts-4 blocked injectors and mouse nests!

Subject- the short version
Here's the long version:
Been wrestling with this bus for 3 days- Yes it's been sitting for over
5 years with gas stabilizer in it, and it even ran POORLY a few weeks
ago when trying to move it into the garage.  CW says you never have FOUR
blocked injectors, so a no start problem usually gotta be something
else, like ignition, air leaks, no fuel pressure, bad relay, no pulses
to ECU or back to injectors, etc.   Did replace the pump as it clicked
but did not run.  All tests of sensors, plugs, grounds, resistor series
OK.  Swapped the ECU, double relay, AFM.  Finally, hooked an injector to
the rail TEE and plugged it in- fine pulsed pray! 
    Thus far I had resisted pulling the injectors as I didn't want to
stress the tubing (this bus is going to a mechanic when will pull the
engine for a trans swap, but I had to get it moving).  So with much
cursing because of the tight conditions (ever try to pull hoses off when
you have so little twisting room?) I first unbolted the injectors on the
right side (hmm, holddown rubber bushing  was rather disintegrated, so
even though bolt was tight, injector was not-leading me to ask FI owners
to see if they can wiggle the injector part itself). Had SO crank it and
nada on the spray.  I put in my Westy &quot;spare&quot; set,  a pair of injectors
taken from a running engine, still attached to the tees of a rail
section.  HOOHAH- it caught, but now I know how an engine runs when
firing on one side only.  Had to wrestle with the EGR crap on the left
side (take it out), and with much cursing, put in a rail piece/attached
injectors from a blown engine.  Started OK, coughed a lot, then ran- I
run back and there is gas oozing from an injector tail, so more cursing
and out with the railpiece.  It's true- flex old injector tubing and
they will crack against where the barb end terminates.  It's a _at_&amp;#_at_^#^$R
pain to add a tail piece- cut the hose off, and I used a dremyl to
carefull slice the hose collar.  Used rolled edge clamps (old ones- the
FI ones NAPA sold me have smooth sides, but edges are not turned).  Got
it all in, and it ran like a champ, with some loping at idle and rpm's
would not go below 1100 with idle screw all the way in.
   Even though it's runnable, we will tow the bus to the mechanic, since
I noticed  mouse nests over the cylinders around the plugs on the right
side, and I don't was dogwood seeds falling down the spark plug hole. 
Tin gotta come off and engine cleaned off.
    bottom line- don't presume convention wisdom!  I figure what happend
is that there was some varnish buildup in the rail where gas stabilizer
didn't get, and even though it ran the few times I started it mostly to
move the bus, the varnish must have moved into the injectors and blocked
them.
