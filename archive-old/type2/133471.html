&gt; &gt;&gt; I need a reasonably priced (around $100.00, more or less)
&gt; &gt;&gt; outdoor cover.  I'm not picky about perfect custom fit
&gt; &gt; I doubt that you will find a *quality* one big enough for a
&gt; &gt; bus at that price.

could always run to the home store and grab a blue plastic tarp the right
size and some rope to tie it on for about $30
&gt;
but this is a lot easier I suspect
&gt;
&gt; Actually you will.  We have a new offering from Just Kampers in England
&gt; that at $129 would probably qualify as &quot;$100 more or less,&quot; and it has a
&gt; unique feature not found on any other cover. As well as being custom fit
&gt; for a Bus or Vanagon (with or without poptop), it has zippered access to
&gt; the front and side doors, so you can get in without removing it. This is
&gt; a great idea, as you can load/unload your bus, start it periodically in
&gt; the winter, or just air it out.  There is a flap over the zipper so it
&gt; won't scratch your paint.

a Question, our city has been ticketing any untagged visible vehicle (even
if on private property) and will tow it after so many days,  if covered
with something like this the TAGS MUST BE VISIBLE!! I have seen these
covers now with clear plastic at the location of the vehicles tags. just
wondering if this cover would be like that or would you have to cut a hole
for the tag to show thru????

Bob
one cities solution I guess to too many abandoned vehicles.
