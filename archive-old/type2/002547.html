: I need this bad, so Fri morning I drive 140 miles to the Depot and at
: 11:15 AM Ron hands me not one but 2 Torque converter seals.!!!!!!,  turn
: around and drive 140 miles home and get the dang seal in and the engine
: installed, tomorrow I find out if it leaks.

: So far every time I have needed something and called the Depot, I have got
: it and gotten it rather fast.

I want to second Bob's opinion here, Ron will generally bend over backwards
to get you something when you need it for a reasonable (realistic) shipping
price, or if there ends up a problem with your order.  A good for instance,
my last order included a set of cam bearings, when I looked over everything
when it came in, I noticed the box was a bit beat up, but I didn't inspect
closely.  Putting the engine together I noticed one shell was dinged and all
had apparently been previously installed, removed, and I'd guess
fraudulently returned.  Called Ron and the new set was on its way priority
mail instantly, got it 2 days later.  This is simply the regular way Bus
Depot rectifies problems in my experience, the stuff is on its way to you
without question, instantly.  And of course to boot the prices were
exceptional for all German bearings.

Another side note on the auto tranny seal, I wonder if Bob is talking about
the 003519089D seal which is a T3 part also used in the Vanagons, so maybe
also in the bus box.  Funny thing there is that the last one I bought was
damaged, new in the Elring (said German) box.  Pretty good chunk of the
inner surface missing, and unquestionably factory sealed packaging.  So pays
to inspect all your parts extremely carefully, quality control isn't what it
used to be.
