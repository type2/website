Subject: Re: [T2] kick panel question???

I love the aftermarket ones that are in my 68 bus.
They are made of a thick, flexable, black textured
plastic. You don't have to wory about
breaking/creasing them when you have to remove them.
Does anyone else have ones like these? I would
recomend them to anyone in the market.

That was my 2 yen worth.

&gt; sets for sale.
