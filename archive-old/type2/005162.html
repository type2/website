Hi, all -

Coming home tonight (Monday), going north on I-75 just about at the Sashabaw
exit north of Auburn Hills, there's a white over mustard yellow bay, maybe a
71, parked on the southbound shoulder.  Is that a listee?  I'll be driving
right past Tuesday morning, could stop and help.  I'm on the AIRS list, call
me you need a hand.
