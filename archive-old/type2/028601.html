&gt;Here's the puzzle: the pistons and valves show signs of *both* too
rich
&gt;and too lean running. On the rich side, everything is coated with
carbon.
&gt;On the lean side, there is pitting on three pistons, and a serious
melt
&gt;spot on the edge of #4 (melted about a square inch of piston top, 1/2
&gt;inch deep).

Mark, are you talking about some pistons being lean and others rich?
Or are
you talking about rich and lean areas on the face of the same piston?

I don't know VW FI that well, but in aircraft, this kind of pattern
can result
&gt;from incorrect engine installation. If the engine isn't level (fore
and aft
and side to side) you can see rich pistons on the &quot;low&quot; side and lean
on the
&quot;high&quot; side. This could be the case in VW's? Anybody else comment on
if this is
a problem?

Also, rich and lean areas on the face of the same piston are a pretty
good
indicator of clogged/screwed-up/miscalibrated fuel injector nozzles.
Time to
send 'em in to an expert -- it's worth it to get 'em right.

Again, I don't know VW FI that well, I'm a wannabusser that used to
own a '68
Bug...but I have been around FI aircraft a fair amount of time. Most
of the
principles are the same.

Good luck!
