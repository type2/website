Well everyone, its update time. [re: 2.0L Type IV =&gt; '60 Double Cab]

I received my cooling shroud from Joe Lociero at Oregon Performance
Products and have been working to get all the external pieces together
before slapping them on the engine.  I have an empty block with
pistonless cylinders and the heads bolted togeather and mounted on an
engine stand.  The shroud is fitted as is the alternator stand,
alternator and fan.

I am in the process of adapting a Bosch CIS fuel injection system to the
engine and am building up a wooden model to test sizing, fitting and
general function.  I have posted a handful of pictures on my web site
and invite comments, questions, etc.

The pics are at http://www.dolphinsci_dot_com/cis-fi.html

Thanks

Scott
