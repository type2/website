Subject: Wiring help, does this sound right?

Hey guys,

    I'm still working on my Bus, and I've almost got all the wiring done, but
I want to make sure that everything is where it's supposed to be. I've been
using the Bently manual, but the wiring diagrams for the 72 are so cluttered
that sometimes it's hard to read. Would you guys mind verifying some of this
for me?


Ok, on the STARTER... there are two male plugs and a large screw lead.

Of the two male prongs, the ONLY thing I have plugged into one is the IGNITION
wire (black and red). I can't get a good enough look, but it appears as though
the other prong is actually apart of the same metal base that the first prong
is on, is this true?

Now, on the large screw lead, I have the following going to it:

1 - Large battery positive cable.
2 - Semi-large red cable coming from the alternator.
3 - Another semi-large red wire that goes all the way to the front of the bus
(runs along the same harness as the ignition wire).
4 - A smaller red wire which goes out into the engine compartment, (I think
this is the power lead for the heater fan).


Does that sound correct?


And then I have the voltage regulator with the three wires that come off the
alternator (plug) and plug into the underside of the voltage regulator on the
firewall. There is ONE blue wire that comes off this plug, and I've plugged it
into the twin BLUE wires (grouped together) that come off the main harness.


Does all of that sound correct?


This is on my 1973 VW Bus which is using all 1972 wiring.

(webber 2-bbl progressive with an 1800cc motor in it).




Thanks!!!

Todd
