Hi all,

     I realize that this is the Type 2 list but I think it's applicaple.  I
just test drove a 82 Westy.  The first time I have ever driven a Vanagon.  I
have always had bays.  It seemed to be in very good shape.  Is there
anything different to look out for?  The heater blower does not work.  Where
is that located?  Is it a PITA to get to?  It seemed to drive &amp; shift nice.
A little more sluggish then my bay windows but I attribute that to the
weight.  Any hints or tips would be appreciated.  Thanks.
