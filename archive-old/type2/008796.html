Subject: Half-assed rebuild question for 1600sp...
Message-ID: &lt;19990401233522.25240.rocketmail_at_web117.yahoomail_dot_com&gt;

Hey All,

I just have a few questions about doing a &quot;partial&quot;
rebuild on my 1600sp in my '69 Westy.

First the facts...

1600sp (not the original) of unknown origin or mileage,
that came with the bus when I bought it. It has
compression ranging from 125-110lbs.

30/31 P.O.S. (sorry, I meant Pict;-) carb.

.009 distributor, yes, I know....!

S&amp;J exhaust

Doghouse oil cooler.


Now... what I am *thinking* of doing is to throw in a
set of P's and C's to bring it up to a *whopping*
1641cc's. I figure it will help my compression and give
me a *little* more hp in the low end. I will also
refurb the heads or even convert to dp's so I can use
my Kadrons (probably not....one carbs a big enough
PITA).

Here's the question... How wise is it to do this not
knowing the condition of the lower end? Also, will this
&quot;improvement&quot; appreciably shorten the life of the
bottom end?

I can't afford a thorough rebuild right now, but living
at 5,500' of elevation, would KILL for even a few more
useable HP.

Lemme know.


Jaime
