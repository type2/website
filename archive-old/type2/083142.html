I live in Australia &amp; I've never been pulled over(touch wood!).

The cops over here have lots of other potential targets, like for instance early 70's Mazda Rx3's &amp; Rx4's with heavily worked rotaries, turbos &amp; subwoofers that make the house shake when they drive past!

And then there's the local F*rd &amp; particularly GM products that the locals like to pretend are the latest in racecar technology.

We never had the Deadhead mentality........in fact while plenty of hippies drove buses, they're more associated with overseas backpackers these days that weed-smoking malcontents :-)

That said, I should REALLY replace my front tyres........

:-)
