Part of it is probably the noise thing.  Most of them sound so awful that its 
easy to jump to the conclusion that they_run_just as bad!  : )

I looked VERY briefly at a couple of them and realized that I could could get 
much more bike in the same v-twin style for a lot less money by buying a 
H*nd* Shadow.  It actually idled, got ~45 mpg, the noise didn't raise the ire 
of my neighbors and it was made in America to boot!  

Based on price and yuppy appeal alone, I would compare Harley ownership less 
to a a VW bus habit and more to a vintage porsche/jaguar/50's era Chevy 
habit.  I suspect most Harley owners pay WAY more for their motorcycles than 
we do for our buses!

I currently have no motorcycle.  When I purchase again, I'm really intrigued 
with older Triumphs and BMW's.  Any listee thoughts? (off list response may 
be preferable so we don't stray TOO far from the list focus!)

thanks,

mark
