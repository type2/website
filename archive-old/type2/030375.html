&gt; Volks,       Does this question that I asked become unanswerable at the
&gt; stroke of midnight?     Steve?        If so,  save your thoughts.....I'd
&gt; still like to get replies, either pmail, or for the sake of the

Volk, 

This is why I suggest those who pose survey questions request personal
responses.  My suggestion is that you respond to Kevin during the course
of this week and that Kevin report the summary next Friday.  If you are
thinking of posing a survey-type question (and I think that there are some
good ones to be posed), I suggest they be in the form of &quot;I would like to
gather opinions on ____________.  Please respond to me.  I will gather the
responses and report them to the list.&quot;  Even a long summary, with
highlights inserted, is better than having disconnected posts trickling
in.
