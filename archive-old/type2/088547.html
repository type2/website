Subject: RE: [T2] NEED DASH AND VENT WINDOW FOR 75 BUS ASAP

John:  I don't have the triangle window, unfortunately.  However, I have an
entire dash out of a '74 bus.....it is not absolutely perfect but it is in
excellent condition.  The metal part of the dash up top, on the passenger
side, has a little bit of surface rust, but really, it would be nothing to
sand down and repaint that piece.  There are 2 holes in the dash, screw
holes, fairly small, where someone attached a softdrink holder......it also
looks as if someone has replaced the tachometer next to the speedometer.
I'm not sure if that used to be a clock or something else, but there is a
tachometer there now.  I took the dash because it was in such good shape.
If this works for you, I could figure out how to get it down to you.  Lemme
know.

Dustin

Subject: [T2] NEED DASH AND VENT WINDOW FOR 75 BUS ASAP


Please help me. Thieves broke into my 75 bus this weekend and stole my
Blaupuntk cd player. In the process they wrecked the dash and the triangle
vent window that's in the passenger door. So the problem is that I am trying
to find NOS or &quot;perfect used parts to replace the damaged parts. Needed are;
one dash, NOS or perfect condition, and one vent window assembly complete
with chrome frame, also in perfect condition. If a used window assembly is
found, the rubber and chrome must be in new condition.

I tried the dealer here in Winnipeg MB, but they said these parts were
discontinued.

Any help locating these parts would be VERY appriciated.

I know this sounds impossible, but I am trying to get these parts (mostly
the window assembly) in my hands by the middle of next week!

Thank You
John Gollub
