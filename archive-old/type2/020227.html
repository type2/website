Subject: Recovering Front Seats-Doesn't Look Easy

Last week some list members said that recovering the front seats took a
little time but wasn't that difficult, just install the kits.  I agree
that doing the passenger seat is no big deal; however, the driver's seat
appears to be a pain.  I just finished removing the covers and pads for
both seats and it's pretty clear that doing the driver's seat is not
going to be much fun.  This is because the back of the drivers seat
won't lay flat because of the recliner mechanism unlike the passenger
seat that will.  It's pretty obvious that when the seats were originally
made, they were covered while they were still in two pieces.  After they
were covered, they were riveted together.

If anyone has any good tips for making the recovering of the driver's
seat any easier, I would sure like to see them.

Thanks,
