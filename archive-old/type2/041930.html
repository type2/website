I just know the difference in price from the one we are using, and the other
one that's &quot;equivalent&quot;. Ours is twice as much.

I have found over the years that &quot;identical&quot; products that cost half as
much...

aren't.

:-)

I'm not sure what they are using, but I DO know what we are using, and ours
is the best.
