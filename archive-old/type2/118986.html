Subject: Re: [T2] 71 for sale in Baltimore area

&gt; &quot;Have a 71 VW bus sitting in a garage for the last 10-15 years-looking for
&gt; a good home for it-call me if you are interested&quot;
&gt; Ric (I think)
&gt; 410-971-3242

I picked up the phone and talked to this guy...his name is Phil instead of
Ric...heck of a nice guy!
He has a Pastel White over Kansas Red Standard Bus rolling shell.
It has been stored for 10-15 years in a garage protected by an inch of dust.
The last thing he did to it was redo all the brakes and repair the rocker
rust.
It does not currently have an engine in it but two engines go with it.
He wants someone to fix it back up like he intended to.
He wants what he paid for it about 15 years ago...$250.00
Duane
