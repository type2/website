Hello All --
Well, my 79 had her compression checked today and I have mixed emotions
about the results.  She's been running like a champ and quite smoothly,
indicates no significant oil usage, and I haven't been sensing any power
loss.  The readings were as follows:

#1: 110
#2: 100
#3: 115
#4: 130

I must admit that I found these numbers a little unnerving to say the
least, comparing them with the last reading I had, which was about 6 months
ago:  115, 120, 120, 135.  The low reading in #2 concerns me, as does the
range between highest and lowest.  I'm looking for anybody's best
educated/informed opinions as to the interpretation of these numbers --
what do you think?  Isn't 100 close to pushing it on the low side?  Am I
facing problems/repair soon or down the road, or are these even cause for
worry?  I know they're pretty much within spec, but they also seem on the
&quot;verge&quot; of something.  Thanks for your time and responses.
