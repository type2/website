Subject: Re: [T2] Stuck in gear

Thanks for the advice.  Actually, I broke my linkage trying to get it out of 
gear and have considered taking a hammer to the selector since.  I'm a bit 
confused about something though...I see where you say the shift is on the 
passenger side of the trans as opposed to the front, but the shift is still 
on what I consider to be the nosecone.  Can this be right?
