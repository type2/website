Subject: RE: [T2] more FI questions (fixed-repost)

Rob, don't remember for sure what year you are working on, but the pump
looks about right.  Looks a little different than mine for the electrical
connections, but generally the same.

How long since you changed the fuel filter?
I would change filters first.  Then do the other test.

make sure you watch the gauge as the pump is running as it should hit
125psi+ almost instantly if you have a good pump and have the fuel ring
squeezed off on the regulator end.  

This is gonna be dangerous...

You are correct, fuel pump capable of about 125psi.  Pressure regulator
bleeds off what the injectors don't want.

Good luck, dave

&gt; &gt; don't know what you did, but works fine, thanks
&gt; 
&gt; Learned to use my carraige return :-)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; line later I had adapted the gauge to fit the ring main 
&gt; &gt; terminal.  So I run
&gt; &gt; &gt; the starter and the gauge reads zero.  When I remove the 
&gt; &gt; gauge and run the

&gt; &gt; hmmmmm, try putting a bike air pump on it and see if it even works??
&gt; 
&gt; Shot 15 psi into it from my compressor and it registered correctly.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; something is screwy here, I would 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; . check to be sure guage works
&gt; &gt; . check to make sure you have a FI pump, sort of looks like a 
&gt; &gt; coil in size
&gt; 
&gt; Hmm, smaller (diameter) than a coil fersure, heres a picture 
&gt; http://www_dot_capefearweb_dot_com/vw/rob/fuel_pump.jpg
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; . check the actual presure able to be pumped by plugging the 
&gt; &gt; line by the
&gt; &gt; regulator.  don't let it get too high, but at least 30-40psi should be
&gt; &gt; able to be pumped pretty quickly
&gt; 
&gt; I'll do this next.  OK, if I understand correctly, the pump puts out
&gt; way more than 35 psi but the regulator keeps it at ~35psi?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
