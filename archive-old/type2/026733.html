Hello Listees,

Sorry to post this way, but I am trying to reach Charlie Ford.  I haven't
heard from him on the list in a while and the old e-mail address I have for
him doesn't work. If you are reading Charlie, drop me a note.  If anyone
else has his current e-mail address please send it to me at
rob.dahlgren_at_aai-us_dot_com or rwdahlgren_at_aol_dot_com

Many thanks and happy Friday!

OBC - Hanna the '72 non-westy camper is slowly undergoing restoration.
Maybe she will make it to BBA this year.
