Subject: attaching wire to distributor points' plate

I'm entering new territory, for me at least.
I'm disassembling a stock distributor to learn more about how it 
works and how to restore it.  The points' plate is grounded to the 
distributor body via a short braided wire.
How does one reattach this wire at either end. The last time I tried 
to solder to steel, I had no success.
Jack
