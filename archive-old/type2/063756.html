I got my '77 Westy fired (2L FI) fired up yesterday after its 8 month long
nap, and only 3 months behind scheduale.  It looks great (at least to me) and
I plan on putting it on the road tonight.  I have a couple of questions first.
It has oil just running out of the valve cover (on the new head I installed).
I did not use new valve cover gaskets yet as I was hoping to get by with my
old ones until my 300 mile break in.  If the valve cover gasket was really 
leaking would oil just pour out.  I will be putting the new ones on tonight
but I am wondering if that is a sign of problems or just bad gaskets (I hope)

2.  The throttle has a little problem returning to idle.  What is the procedure
for attaching the cable to the FI so I can see if I did it right.  I may have 
too much slack in the cable or vice versa.  The throttle does not stick
wide open but just above idle (maybe 1400 rpm).

3.  Is there some kinda of heat shield that goes between the muffler and the
rear tin.  I believe there is the remnants of one left on my bus.  Is it
really important.  

4.  Any one know of a cheap source of heat exchanger valve and the pipe that
connect them to the heat exchagers?

5.  anyone have any breakin stratagies that they want to share with me.
I just replaced one head and installed new rings.

Please respond as soon as possible,  I plan on leaving here around 2:00 EST
to pick up my bus and would like to take this information with me.

Thank you again,
Brett
