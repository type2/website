Subject: Engine FIXED!

Last week I posted my tale of woe about the scraping sounds, coming and going
then coming again, parking the truck and not being able to start it.  I had just
changed pushrod seals, adjusted the valves and feared the worse.  Engine would
not start or even sputter.  Sounded like gouging when turing the starter over.

Well..... I went out this morning and had my neighbor watch the engine and see
if he could determine the source of the noise.  I was greeted with &quot;Hey, your
engine isn't turning&quot;

Pulled the starter and turns out that the thing was just flat worn out.  Starter
bushing was almost non-existant and the starter itself was worn to the point
were it wouldn't turn and engage properly.

$81 and a new bosch starter &amp; bushing later and the truck fired right up!!

Now I get my vacation back next week instead of tearing apart the engine.

One note:  I am REALLY glad I had the neighbor check, as I was that close to
just going out this morning and pulling the engine.  Imagine the frustration at
pulling the engine, not finding anything wrong, putting it back in and finding
out that the problem is with the starter.
