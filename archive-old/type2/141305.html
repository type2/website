Subject: Maui bus folks

Hi, I have the chance to visit Maui from Dec 11 to 17 and wonder if there is 
any folks who might want to meet a Canadian Bus driver... I can't bring the 
dog sled... but I will have my tuque , which I am told is genuine saskatawan 
seal skin.  I might need it as Haleakala apperantly is cool in the morning 
.. I'll be hanging loose in Kihei

If there are any list members on the island who might have time to get 
together... let me know at jrivers_at_globalserve_dot_net

Jamie Rivers
