For the sake of clarification...

Is VWoA [in the case of RMMW, for instance] going after only items carrying
the [unlicensed/unauthorized] VW logo or name?

Or, are they going after ALL aftermarket replacement parts and pieces with
Volkswagen applications?

I strongly disagree with VWoA's position whatever the answer, but it would
be useful to know the parameters of the fight.
