Hey all.  
Looks like my front beam needs replacing....its pretty rust.  It is so rusty
in fact, that it has rusted through on the bottom of both the panels on each
side that connect the upper bar to the lower bar.  Thus, just a couple of
days ago, I started to experience very strange brake pedal action and
steering...it looks like what has happened is that the plate separating the
top bar from the bottom bar of the beam unit has &quot;settled&quot; down a little
becuase the bottom part of the plate is so rusty!! ...thus, throwing off the
alignment of the servo/master cylinder and the steering linkage so nothing
is really lined up like it should be!   Anyone ever experience this??  I
thought at first I was having just a brake problem, however, the steering is
off too..its pulling and just not treading the road correctly...the wheel
itself is also *turned* so that going straight down the road, the cross bar
that cuts across the center of the steering wheel is no longer side to side,
it is top to bottom.   After i got under the bus, i noticed that where the
bottom part of both plates on each side of the beam wrap around the bottom
bar..the plate is eaten through and it *appears* that the top part of the
beam and the plates have settled down on the bottom bar.  Is this possible?
Is my front axle ready to roll out from under me?  wow....  After I saw that
it just seemed to explain both the brakes and the steering to some
degree....if it is not that, then I cannot understand why brakes and
steering would become so strange at exactly the same time.  One more example
of my strange brakes now is this:  I was backing out of my driveway, a day
after this started, and as I went from the dirt part of my driveway up the
ridge and onto the road, I had my foot gently on the brake pedal as I rolled
out...and as the front tires went up over the little curb to back out onto
the road, I felt the brake pedal come *up* also as the tires rolled over the
curb.  Just the brake pedal.  That was definitely weird.  I parked it for
good right then. 

 Any ideas on this anyone?  And, if you think it just may be the beam (which
needs to be replaced anyhow), does anyone know where I could look in the
greater massachusetts area and what this baby may cost me??  

Any help, as usual,  is greatly appreciated.....
