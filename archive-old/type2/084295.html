&gt; &gt; I too have been concerned with temperature in my stock '70 Bus.  I put
&gt; this rebuilt engine in at the beginning of the year and its first long
&gt; trip was to L.A. in Feb.  At that time I determined that I could run it
&gt; at 70 all day long but any increment over
&gt; &gt; that brought my Berg dipstick to life.  I was concerned that the
&gt; speed/temperature matrix would get lower during the summer months.  In
&gt; anticipation of another trip this past weekend I switched from a
&gt; multiweight oil to straight 30 weight and gained 5
&gt; &gt; degrees on my matrix.  I'm happy to report that I can now cruise at 75
&gt; or better all day long and even push it over Pacheco Pass without
&gt; overheating.  I'm now a strong convert to using straight 30 weight in an air cooled VW.
&gt;
&gt; I hope that you're measuring speed with a very optomistic speedometer.  A
&gt; stock '70 bus is spinning its poor little engine pretty fast at 65, let
&gt; alone 75!  I find that a comfortable cruising speed is more like 60-62
&gt; real MPH.

I should have mentioned that my front tires are 70 series (purchased before I knew any
better) so that wasn't my real speed.  From surrounding traffic and engine speed I would
guess I was probably going about 10 mph less than indicated.
