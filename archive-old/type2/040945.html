Subject: FREE 78 bus nose in missouri!

hi all,

A friend of mine is leaving missouri with his bus and going to california
to sail a boat around for almost a year...

He bought a perfect 78 bus nose from a junker to have welded onto his, but
has decided that the crunched nose suits him fine, and he cant take the
nose with him, therefore its free for the taking.

I havent seen the nose, but i trust my friend and if he says its in great
shape i'm sure it is.

I might be willing to meet you somewhere with it for gas money, but my
friend will be unwilling to ship, this is a come and get it deal (or send
a freight carrier thats willing to pack it up for you..)

Just p-mail me and i'll hook you up.

take care,

Steve
