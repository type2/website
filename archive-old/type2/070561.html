Subject: Re: [T2] Yakima rack fit question...
Cc: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

not sure if they will clear or not (im guessing they will, stop in at 
the local Yakima dealer and they should be able to help you by 
opening a box, and checking against the actual bus) I have my Yakima 
mounted to the top so I can raise it with my bikes still attached. I 
use a simple strap/pulley (can be purchased at k-mart for $7, think 
its used for truck beds for holding things down) thing to hold it in 
place better, I put the hooks in the gutters and across the bikes no 
problems yet. I know this doesnt answer your question but if your 
thinking about mounting them in  to the top its a better idea so you 
can raise it without having to remove the cross bars.

&gt;I own a 76' Westy and am looking into ordering racks for it soon. 
&gt;Does anybody know for sure if the Yakima 1A Raingutter towers w/ the 
&gt;HiRise extension will fit over the fiberglass top when mounting the 
&gt;feet to the raingutter and not the pop-top?  I do not want to mount 
&gt;them on the pop-top.  I know that Thule has a system that will work 
&gt;like this, but would really prefer Yakima as I've owned Thule's 
&gt;before and did not care for the crossbar strength.  Thank you for 
&gt;any help.
