Subject: hard starting fuel injected bus

1978 bus is hard to start when cold, it's not really cold out where the
cold start system would be activated, but when the engine is cold.

1978 california emmissions, no more cat, hyd lifers

I can get it to start if I disconnect the afm, then reconnect it after =
it starts.  Seems like that makes it artifically rich for a bit. =20
Replaced the intake seals, and air filter this weekend, not much help.

Compression is good 90-95, cold
Fuel pressure is 35 during cranking, new fuel filter, and air flter
Timing at 8ish at idle, 009 distrib

Only one of the plugs seems wet when cranking, the others are dry.

It seems like it is set up incredably lean on start, is there a way to =
richen it up some how?  Any suggestions

Eric
