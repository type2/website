&gt; I was looking through an old box of spark plug wires last week and came across
&gt; some silicone boots that fit the spark plug end of the ceramic connectors. The
&gt; part number is 311-905-444A and ETKA shows it as an option for 2L engines.
&gt; 
&gt; It appears they were installed on vehicles running in damp climates. Can
&gt; anyone confirm this? I'm also not sure if it was a feature of Beru wire sets
&gt; or not.


In the rare occasion that I have seen an engine that has the original
ignition wires, the boots are always there, bus or beetle.
