Subject: Re: [T2] great door speaker location!!!

&gt;Thanks Greg, here is a bit more info,,  I dunno about semigloss,, as the can I
&gt;had was called NO GLOSS..  but as long as it isn't Gloss,,, reflects too much
&gt;light,, and Flat,, catches all the dirt,, then your ok!

I used Rustoleum black textured paint on the metal portion of the dash. It 
looks good and does not reflect alot of like (since it is broken up by the 
texture). Get it at your FLHS. It's quite tough paint and is easy to wipe 
clean so far.
