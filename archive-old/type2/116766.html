Subject: Re: [T2] I've (still) Got the Oil Leak Blues...

Hey-

Do you have an electric fuel pump? My '73 developed a similar leak, and it
turns out that what had happened was that the diaphragm in the unused
mechanical fuel pump ruptured, and started leaking oil. The drips ran down
and looked like it was leaking from the main seal. Block-off plates are
available if you are in the US, though I just cut out a piece of gasket
material the size of the cover plate, and re assembled. No drips!

Cheers,
Matthew
