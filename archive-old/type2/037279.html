Subject: &quot;new&quot; bus

hey Volks!
        Just wanted to update yall on my saga.  Some of you might remember 
that I was looking for an engine for my 74 westy that was running on two 
cylinders.  Well  last Saturday it finally went  KABLOOEY
on me and now tries to run on two. Ive decide to buy a new avp when
uncle sam makes a deposit in my account this month .   So...........  Monday 
I went looking for a new truck since I work out of my bus, being a 
subcontractor, and couldn't find anything I really wanted , or needed that 
badly.  I got home that night and thought ... my friend Paul ( fellow listee) 
 has a bus he has been trying to sell and he only wants 500, and it doesn't 
use oil , or leak any, why not call him. My wife said I could buy it so we 
took a trip over their and now its mine. What a fine bus it is too. 
Well ill quit rambling.
