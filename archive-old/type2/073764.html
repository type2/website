Subject: Re: [T2] Friday musings, Buses &amp; Harleys

Dave, list:
Gotta chime in here. I had a couple of Big Twin Harleys when I was 18. Then I
wanted to go fast. Sold them, nearly gave them away. I can see the parallels
between them and VW type 2's.
My dad is 75 years old and wants to sell his BMW. It's an 81 R100/7. The bike
has 47k miles on it. And he's asking $2800.
It's a light silver. This is NOT an RS or RT, just a plain /7. But it has had
good
maintenance and very light use. Too light maybe, pretty carboned up, but that
should be no big problem.
Very little short trips/ commuting miles. Also very little two-up  riding. Mom
has
never been on a bike, Dad usually goes with friends on Saturday mornings. I
should
REALLY buy the thing myself. But it would be a tremendous lifestyle change for
me,
having a bike that actually runs! I've got about 10 British bikes in various
stages of disassembly.
We are in Waterloo, Iowa. POSSIBLY could arrange delivery pulled behind VW type
2 on a trailer.

&gt; Ok. Since it's Friday and all.

&gt; I useta own a Hardley Ableson.  A '68 Sportster.  Spent all winter beefing
&gt; up the engine and it was running real good.  Until I got lost in a real bad
&gt; neighborhood in DC about 3am and it decided to puke the engine innards.
&gt; Lesson #1 in heavy modifications - not worth it in the real world.  Lesson
&gt; #2 is don't go into such places unarmed.
&gt;
&gt; FFWD to many years later, tired of riding fast plastic but still riding
&gt; 20k/year.  Traded a carb rebuild on a 1942 Packard for a frame and 3 milk
&gt; crates in the corner of the guys garage.  Assembled a 1964 BMR R69S from
&gt; those parts.  Rode it a year, was &quot;given the opportunity&quot; to have to
&gt; disassemble it because of an accident.   Sold my GSXR1100 and bought a 76
&gt; BMW and have ridden those 2 same bikes for the last 13 years.  The 76 has
&gt; over 250k miles, and I still haven't had to open the engine up.
&gt;
&gt; Screw the Hardley image thing, if you want a bike that resembles your
&gt; beloved bus look hard at an older BMW.  You won't be sorry.
