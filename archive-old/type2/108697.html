Subject: fuel filter

Paul,
The 'filter' in the fuel pump is only a plastic screen and won't stop much,
just the big chunks. It also doesn't stop water getting through.
The aftermarket plastic ones are paper elements and much finer to stop a lot
more getting through, they also have a much larger surface area so won't
block as quickly.
If you mount them correctly, they will also stop most water getting through.
Water is heavier than fuel, so mount them so it goes in the bottom, out the
top. This is a little hard in a bus, but I have found mounting them
horizontal they still trap water (they usually have the inlet/out let in the
centre of the filter). Just remember if there is enough water in the filter
to be in contact with the paper element it can close the pores of the paper
and block the filter!!!
