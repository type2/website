Gordon:

We are not sure how it will function in your aluminum Type 4 engine, however
we have heard reports of Slick 50 damaging magnesium Type 1 and early Type 2
engine cases.

Generally speaking, using a good quality oil and changing it every 3000
miles is your best bet.

Thank You!

Subject: Slick 50 treatment


 Hey,
         Has anyone had positive experience using Slick 50 or any of the
 other teflon(or non-teflon) treatments in extending their engine's life?
 I'm just about to get a 2.0 L rebuild back on the road and was
 wondering, of course wanting to get the maximum mileage out of her. The
 air-cooleds being such fragile beasts I thought this might be a good
 idea, but have never heard it discussed regarding volksies.
