Hi everybody
    My name is Rick B and I just wanted to introduce myself.  I've been 
reading the list for about a week now.  Just before Christmas I bought a 1977 
bus (Transporter I think), it has seating for seven.  It needs some minor 
electrical work, it's missing some of the FI parts, has some damage to the 
left rear engine venting area along with minor dents, scratches and rust.  
The good news is that it does start and run.  This is my second bus (  the 
first one got traded for a type one that only needed a motor )   but the 
first one I will drive.  I'm really looking forward to learning a lot, 
driving a bus, and keeping up with the list.
    A little personal info.
    I also own 68 bug (not on the road), a 69 chassis dune buggy (Building 
should be completed as soon as spring gets here), a 73 super beetle baja 
(daily driver) and last but not least is the 77  2.0L bus.
    I am married with one daughter and two cats.


    If there are any other list members in the Hampton Roads area please get 
in touch with me  ..... I would love to here from you.....until I have 
questions....thank you for your time.
