Subject: Re: [T2] &quot;hockey stick transmission bushing&quot;

&gt;All this recent talk about shifting problems and how the &quot;hockey stick
&gt;transmission bushing&quot; fixed the problem made me start to think that I
&gt;should replace mine.  So I put in the keyword of hockey stick
&gt;transmission bushing in several online venders and guess what, nothing
&gt;comes back as being found to that description.  I'm guessing Volkswagen
&gt;had another name or description for it.  If someone could be so kind to
&gt;let me know what VW calls it I would appreciate it.

The VW ETKA catalog calls it the shifter mechanism (I've heard the rod 
called the shifter rod).
