Subject: Re: [T2] Rust protection device - Snake oil or the fountain of
  youth ?

There's a company that used to advertise with Two Guys Garage (the TV show on SPEED). They sell a device that does this same thing. (What Busaholic said... forget the technical name).

I think it's like $300 bucks, and it's good for 1 vehicle.  They were rated for a certain size... so we might need two for the BUS.

I don't think it's snake oil, but... I've never tried it personally.  If you have the ability to garage your Bus... that's the best thing you can do. You just want to make sure your garage has vapor barriers.

I've seen cars completely rot out underneath because the concrete slab below wasn't properly laid (and there was no insulation). It was a 1978 Corvette Anniversary Edition. The previous owner had spent like 15 grand getting it restored in the mid 90s. The guy apparently died, and left the car in the garage for 6 years. The entire frame underneath had rotted out. It looked like swiss cheese. Then my friend bought it, and let it sit outside for another 9 years. Now it just needs to be hauled off to the junkyard!

&gt; State of Oregon had trouble with thereinforcing steel 
&gt; in the coastal bridges corroding away inside the 
&gt; concrete. Now all the coastal bridges are charged. 
&gt; Here's a bit of info about it:
