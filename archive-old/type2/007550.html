I'd have to agree with Ken Hooper on this one. While Dave Easterwood
is correct in saying that a typeI *SHOULD* run between 185 and 210,
the reality (at least for most of us) is that it runs substantially
hotter. Just ask any of my fellow Arizona bus driving brethren!!!!

My '69 poptop Westy runs at around 225 on the highway. This is normal
for MY bus and it has all the cooling fins/ducts/tin/engine
seals/etc., etc. in place and operating properly. Yes, this is a tired
motor, but certainly not shot.

It actually got to 260 while my wife, 3 cats and I (and a full load of
camping equipment) drove through Death Valley last summer!!! It was
117 degrees (yes, that's FAHRENHEIT, folks!!!) outside and pulling
over to let the engine cool was not an option, so I pressed on.
Changed the oil in Las Vegas and she's been fine ever since. Yes, the
oil was cooked and we all know what that means, but after 4 hours of
driving at that temp, the motor is still fine. 

Let's not forget that temp senders located in different areas on the
same motor will vary greatly in readings while we're at it.

The moral of this story is: find out what is the normal temp (whether
oil temp or cylinder head temp) for YOUR BUS, driven in YOUR AREA,
under YOUR DRIVING STYLE/CONDITIONS and use that as your guide. Any
major fluctuations should be dealt with accordingly.

BYE BYE!!
