Subject: Throttle Valve Positioner, remove or not?
Message-Id: &lt;199905061049.DAA07718_at_smtp6.jps_dot_net&gt;

Hi all,

I'm about to overhaul my carb, a 30-PICT-3 on
my '70 Westy.

As I am exempt from Smog here is California, what
is the option on removing the throttle positioner doohickey!

Good? bad? makes no difference?

I have a stock 1600 SP with '009 dizzy.



Regards,

Paul &amp; &quot;Mary&quot;
