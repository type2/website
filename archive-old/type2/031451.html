&gt; In short, I'm having a backfire through number 3 cylinder and the engine
&gt; just really runs funky.
&gt; 
&gt; Any assistance from any source would be appreciated.

check your valves, hyd lifters can get out of adjustment too.  had this
problem when a valve seat pulled through...somehow me rebuilder got a set
of valve seats that hadn't been tempered.  he rebuilt em for me without
any problem. but it was a pain swapping heads again (now gotta take my
spare set out and put the rebuilt ones back on)
