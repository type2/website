Subject: Whats this thing???

List,
First of all, big shout out to mr. dolan and minions for the new type2 page - nice.  Question - non computer literate friend has stock 64 kombi with we think a 1500&gt; there is this thing between the carb and the intake that has a butterfly valve in it, no vacuum or electrical connection and a cover plate (facing towards hatch)shaped like an odd triangle.  The cover plate has braided wire running between all of the screws holding the cover plate on and a lead seal(about 1/4&quot; in diam) joining the ends of the wire stamped with a vw logo.  What is this thing?  Could be in bentley - not in haynes or muir. Mystery... Thanx for input...
