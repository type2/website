&gt; Christopher:
&gt; Primer will do NOTHING to prevent rust, but rather enhance rust. Primer is made
&gt; to enhance adhesion of panit to bare metal and it also has a lot of
&gt; attractivness for water. (It draws the water into the surface just like it does
&gt; the paint.)
&gt; A good thing to coat it with would be POR-15. This is a tough (REALLY TOUGH)
&gt; waterproof coating that stops rust. This stuff is incredible. It needs no
&gt; topcoating to work. Look in the archives to find where to buy it.
&gt; Al

So all this sanding down to bare metal and then coating with primer i've
been doing  isn't really helping? Is it possible to remove rust though
sanding and then coating with primer or should i go back over the rust
spots now coated with  primer and sand down the primer and coat with
POR-15?

Eli
