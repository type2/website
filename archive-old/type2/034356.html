Subject: dual carb type IV third idle solenoid?

I have an '80 vanagon, but with a 2 litre type 4
motor with dual carbs. (Euro spec.) My Bently has
all of the specs for the FI engine, but nothing about
carbs.

My question: There are two idle solenoids, one on each carb.
I can deal with that. Then, there is a third thing that looks
like an idle solenoid attached to the left carb and the balance 
tube. It is wired to the left idle solenoid, but I cant
figure out what it could be. Does it isolate the carbs 
electronically? How does it affect my tuneup?

Bonus question: I am getting a leak from
the rear center of the engine. I think it might be
the rear seal, but the archives suggest that the 
cooler might also be a culprit. Anything else
behind there that I can take a look at? If I 
do the rear seal, can I do it with the engine in
the vanagon? Do I have to drain the oil to do it?
(All in the archives, but no two opinions are the
same. I need more 'opinions'.)
