Subject: Re: [T2] I have MegaSquirt on my '77 bus ...

That's the post I wanted to hear.

To read the list - it seemed VERY complicated. I'm glad it wasn't.

Hope the Canadian fellow that posted the first message read this.

This message is alot more informative than my Armchair Engineering version.

You've peaked my interest and I'll be looking at it all again!

I knew the Megasquirt brain was potentially leaps and bounds ahead of the 
stock 20-something year old VW brain but you sort of quantified it for me. 
Thanks.

Ciao!
