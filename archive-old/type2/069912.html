Subject: Re: breadloaf sagging

My '73 Westy came new from the factory sitting lower in the rear than in
front.  As a matter of fact I complained to the dealer about not being able
to see far enough to the rear  out of the inside rear window 'cuz it was
sitting so low.  Dealer's response:  &quot;that's the way they are designed, that
is the spec&quot;. 

Every loaf I have looked at with &quot;sagging&quot; in mind has sat the same way.  I
think the front is high to allow softer springing or greater loading of
passengers, or something.  If your 'loaf's' attitude really bothers you, you
can reset the spring plates, but I would be careful about checking toe-in
after doing it.
