Subject: Re: [T2] Big clutch nightmare!!

Does anyone have a bellhousing I could use to fit around the 228mm flywheel?
They will bolt directly to a 72 tranny right? Figure I better ask now to be
sure.

Thanks!

&gt; Well I removed the starter and the engine won't budge at all!!! I can't
turn
&gt; it, even on the fan hub bolt. I didn't think to turn the engine at all,
&gt; before I installed it.
&gt;
&gt; We had to wrestle it a little bit at first, thinking that the splines
&gt; weren't lined up. It wouldn't go the last inch or so, but after jacking
the
&gt; engine up a bit it slid in.
&gt;
&gt; Would the larger flywheel keep the engine from moving at all? Buying
another
&gt; starter isn't going to fix this is it? Because the engine should turn
freely
&gt; with the starter removed right?
&gt;
&gt; I guess I have no choice but to drop the new engine. Shouldn't the guy who
&gt; recommended the 228 mm have told me I would have issues here? I actually
&gt; asked for the 215mm and he told me I should use the 228.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for all the help so far.
&gt;
&gt; I am gonna have a beer and cry now.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; I am assuming you mean the starter spins but does not engage the
flywheel?
&gt; &gt; If yes, are you still using the 72 starter?
&gt; &gt; If yes, it will not work. You 1st need to try a 76 and up starter. The
&gt; drive
&gt; &gt; is longer. Up to the 2.0L, the teeth on the drive are at the sprague
&gt; &gt; [over-running clutch]. On the 2.0L there is a 1/2&quot; blank space between
the
&gt; &gt; teeth and the sprague. The teeth stick out further. This is also why you
&gt; &gt; cannot use the SR17X self supporting starter on a 2.0L manual trans, but
&gt; you
&gt; &gt; can on the auto trans.
&gt; &gt; I would try the starter and if it did not fix it, then the other fix
would
&gt; be
&gt; &gt; a 210 or 215 flywheel.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I just finished installing my rebuilt AVP 2000cc engine in my 72
Westy.
&gt; On
&gt; &gt; &gt; the suggestion of GoWesty I went with the bigger clutch AND flywheel,
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; 228mm.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Well now I am trying to start my engine for the first time and the
&gt; starter
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;fires&quot; but it won't engage or turn the engine. The engine went in
fine.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Is this because I have a starter for my 72 (210mm flywheel) and now I
&gt; have a
&gt; &gt; &gt; bigger clutch? I sure hope so. Do I have to get a different starter?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The starter doesn't spin freely, but its also not turning the engine.
We
&gt; &gt; &gt; can't seem to turn the engine over with a wrench either!!
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for the help!
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Here are some pics I put up now that its in. However I can't get it to
&gt; &gt; &gt; start:
