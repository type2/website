Hi all,
    With the recent posts about gas heaters, and the coming of winter, I
thought I'd tell you all what happened to me a few years ago.  I was working
on our 79 bus and thought I'd fire up the gas heater to make sure it was
operating properly.  Since the bus was not running I could hear the heater
making all of the right noises as it was turned on.  A short time later
(less than a minute) smoke was coming out of every defroster and heater vent
in the van and was quickly followed by bright orange flames.  I quickly shut
everything off, jumped out of the bus,and slammed the doors shut.  I ran to
the phone and called the local volunteer fire department and then went back
out to the driveway.  The bus had filled up with smoke and the only thing
visible on the inside was the flames going half way up the windshield toward
the ceiling.  I thought if the head liner caught fire the bus would become
fully engulfed and burn to the ground, possibly causing the house to catch
fire too.  Although I'm only a 1/4 mile from the fire dept. I couldn't wait
and felt I had to take some action.  I carefully looked under the bus to
make sure it wasn't on fire and went under to disconnect the fuel line to
the heater.  I pulled the line off the tee where it ties into the fuel
system, off course now gasoline was pouring on to the ground under the bus.
I used a pair of vise-grips to shut off the fuel flow and got away from the
car.  Just about now the fire dept. shows up and I explained the problem.
We couldn't see any more flames but the bus was filled with smoke.  The
firemen cautiously opened a door and confirmed that there were no flames.
They waited a while longer while I filled out the required forms.
    Several days later I removed the heater and found the cause of the fire.
Some mice had built a nest of dry grass.  Infact, as I removed the grass I
found the barbecued remains of 6 baby mice.  The moral and bus maintenance
of this story is........  Well I think you get the point.   Maybe even more
important, let me say &quot;thankyou&quot; to any of you who might be volunteer
firefighters!
