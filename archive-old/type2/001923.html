Subject: [T2] engine dies when in gear


&gt; After rebuilding and installing my fuel injected 2.0, i have run
into a
&gt; slight problem(ha).  The engine starts up fine, but when i put the
car into
&gt; gear and try to accelerate, it dies on me.

I assume you mean that you put the car into 1st, attempt to drive out
of the driveway, but the engine just bogs down and dies?  Did you, by
any chance, remove the transmission when you removed the engine?  In
that case, you might really be in 3rd gear instead of first, and
unless your driveway has a steep downward slope to it you'll never get
going.  You might check this out.

&gt; Then the car needs to sit for a
&gt; couple of minutes before it starts up again.

So it won't restart immediately after it dies?  Just turns over but
won't start up?  But if you let it sit for a while it *will* start?
The engine might be flooded; check it out by trying to start up with
your foot holding the gas peddle to the floor.

&gt; I have already ruled out the
&gt; possiblity that i cant drick stick, where do i go from here?

Ahh... but what if you can't drive a stick?  ;-)
