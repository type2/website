Subject: Thanks Jeff! 

I'd just like to publicly thank Jeff Carver for sending me a box
of hoses that he had removed from his van. I go them this morning,
and they will definitley help contribute to getting my van back to 
full fighting form. 
Cost? FREE! He just sent them to me to help me out. Its this type of helping
each other out that makes this list so valuable (IMHO). So if any of you
get a chance to help Jeff sometime, or anyone else, please do so to 
help balance the Cosmic Books.

Thanks Again Jeff
