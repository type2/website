Subject: Re: [T2] flywheel seal

The o-ring you write about does belong in the little groove inside the lip on
the flywheel. Be sure to check the groove for
the old seal carefully. You should also have a seal pressed into the engine
case. Make sure you use a good seal for the
case as a cheap FLAPS one leaked terrible on me. You may want to take the
time to check your end play now. Do that before you install the seals. It's
not hard and if  your local to Mystic, CT you can borrow end play tool.

&gt; I wanted to clarify somethings as i read my post. The seal is listed as
&gt; an O-ring for flywheel (021 105 279) not seal. Installed as I put it in
&gt; it was resting against the washers (which I'm sure caused the bind,
&gt; thanks steve) The problem is what is actually supposed to go in that
&gt; little groove on the inside of the flywheel? the o-ring i was sent
&gt; looked a lot like graphite (same color) and was not like rubber,
&gt; flattened out then stayed that way.

&gt; &gt; What orientation (location) is the flywheel seal on a 79 2 liter
&gt; &gt; supposed to be? I ask because IIRC it came off with out one in place. I
&gt; &gt; ordered the seal b/c seemed important. When i put it the crank (so that
&gt; &gt; it was located on the outside of the raised portion where the 5 bolt
&gt; &gt; holes are) and torqued it to 80 lbs. it caused the crank to be almost
&gt; &gt; solid. It took a lot of effort to move it just a little. So either i
&gt; &gt; installed the seal incorrectly, something is adjusted out of wack, or i
&gt; &gt; don't actually need it.
