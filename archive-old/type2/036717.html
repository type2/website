Subject: Don't fear the respirator

Ok, I know this has been flogged in the forum but I
have a related thought to share.

The guy I bought my 914 from was a &quot;painter&quot; and
apparently taught auto-body, etc. for a while at some
high school.  He had all the equipment and painted in
his garage.  He even painted my 914, most of it
anyway.  My point is he never used anything other than
a cheapo dust mask.  The reason he was selling the
914?  Dying of prostrate cancer and trying to reduce
inventory.  I obviously can't say that no protective
equipment=cancer but the guy who taught the auto
painting class that I took seemed to think it did.  Go
ahead, flame me...I'm wearing a Nomex-wrapped
respirator. ;)

I really need to read the digest the day it shows up. 
How was the get-together in Leesburg, VA?  I could
have made that one no problem.  Drat.

Relevant bus content:
Tonight I successfully disassembled my dash and
replaced the fuel gauge.  What a concept!  This is the
4th bus I've owned and the only one with a working
gauge!  I went down to the Mobil, turned on the key,
started fueling and watched the needle move for the
first time ever!  Yes!!!

Ok, so I'm easily amused.
