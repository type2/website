Subject: back issues of VWT for sale

hello all:

i have some back issues of VWTrends that are gathering dust in my closet.

here's what i have:
Dec98-Oct99, Feb00, Apr00, Jun00-Jan01, Mar-May01 (23 issues total)

also a couple of issues of Hot VWs that i can throw in.

i no longer subscribe to VWT (don't get me started...). anyway, rather than
shipping i would like to arrange pick up/delivery at EveryBus.

how about 30 bucks for the whole lot? (thats barely over $1 per issue)

email me at jowils_at_unx.sas_dot_com if you are interested.
