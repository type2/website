Subject: RE: [T2] Battery Tray Replacement


&gt;&gt;&gt;and the driver's side battery tray has a BIG hole in it.
&gt;
&gt;Opps.  Sorry.
&gt;
&gt;It is the PASSENGER side battery tray with the hole.
&gt;
&gt;Are you beginning to see the REAL problem here!!

Trim out the rusted metal and if you have a good &quot;band&quot; of good metal left 
around the edges you have an easy fix ahead.

Once the trimming of the old tray is done leaving a bad around the edge, 
place the new tray under the old tray and mark the shape of the hole of the 
old tray onto the new tray. Cut the new tray so there is about a 1&quot; band of 
excess metal around the hole. Basically a 1&quot; overlap on the new tray. Now 
you can use a flanger tool (based on a pair of Vice Grips there is a tool 
bodywork tech use - EASTWOOD has pics if you want to shop around) OR you 
can poprivet the new tray to the old tray remains. I'd seal the seams with 
seam sealer found at any Autobody shop supply store or NAPA carries it as 
well (many FLAPS will). It is sold in a caulking tube.

Clean the old tray with a wire brush on a drill or small angle grinder. 
Coat it top and bottom with EXTEND or POR-15. Attach the new tray. Seal the 
seams top and bottom. Pop rivet the two together. Paint.

You could weld it in (my preference) but you will have to clean it, weld 
it, seal it, EXTEND it, paint it.
