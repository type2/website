Vo,

(1971 Westy with super-stock 1600cc type 1 engine, Weber 34 ICT dual carbs)

Since I spouted off about the charge mix I thought I'd do further testing,
and see just how rich I could go without producing black smoke, backfires,
and horrible fuel mileage.  Though I tried to do just one change at a time
I couldn't quite pull it off, this is a work in progress. 

I changed the mains to 147 (from 140), and while I was inside I couldn't
help but change the air to 160 (from 150), and the idle down to 52 (from 60
in an effort to keep backfire/sputtering to a minimum).  The 02 meter got
richer around town, but there was now a stumble just off idle and in the
super light throttle range.  I ran the timing ahead to about 18-20 BTDC
(from 15) on the 009/Pertronix.  The stumble diminished but did not
disappear.  On a warmed up highway run (&lt;10 miles) with the new advanced
timing the 02 had only a barely noticeable richer reading, but even doing
75-80 mph the oil temp wasn't moving past 180, midday, at about 75 degrees
F air temp.  I think it has a bit better high speed power.  This was
already a pretty cool running engine and previously would've only hit about
200 under the same conditions.  Downhill deceleration sputtering did not
seem to change, it still has a slight spit, so much for the 52 idles.

This exhaust is a dual &quot;quiet pack&quot; extractor with very tight flange type
fittings that I brazed on where the stock heat exchanger tips meet the
extractor.  I use the 15mm type head nut for maximum flange coverage
wherever I can get them to fit, on the rest I use the stock 13mm nut.  It's
likely an engine with the leaky stock clamps, or any other leak, would have
a nasty backfire under the same conditions.

I now imagine many of the list members out there ripping into their carbs
and I must say BE CAREFUL, fuel and sparks don't mix!  Keep that fire
extinguisher charged and nearby, and either dis-connect the battery and/or
be darn sure there are no sparks, electrical or mechanical, around your
open carbs.   Raw fuel is a pollutant, stick it back in the carb or in your
spare fuel can.

Due to the heavier exhaust smell, I no longer believe that the richer mix
does not pollute any more than the leaner mix.  My nose tells me it does,
perhaps it's the price for keeping the VW running cool.

Please also make very sure there are no vacuum leaks in your intake system.
 When I took the carbs out the little covers over the distributor vacuum
take-off were badly disintegrated and must've been leaking air.  It's very
easy to do an intake install and have a leak.  An old problem I ran into
was when I tried to put a single port manifold back on an engine that had
the cylinders shimmed out for lower compression.  The engine was .120&quot;
wider and that was enough to make the intake manifold fail to mate properly
with the port on the heads.  I eventually went to dual carbs to solve the
problem.  I've also had to replace the hoses and check valve for the power
brake system to insure there were no leaks.  I always keep a spare check
valve.  The balance tube and fittings should be closely checked and
tightened, a lesson I learned when I couldn't get a pair of Dellorto FRD's
to perform until I fully bottomed the hose clamps on the balance tube.  The
next time I took off, the engine jumped to life as all the carb circuits
became engorged.  Use an oil spray to find leaks, if the idle changes, you
know you've found a leak. 

Next steps are to replace the 60 idle jet and make sure the stumble goes
away (it should).  I'll try to have a bit of patience and run a couple
tanks through to get a sense of the mileage before I try the 155 mains.  If
I can finally get a rich highway reading, I'll try a CD ignition and maybe
even the 1.4:1 rockers to see if the engine can use the fuel.  Though I
long ago promised myself I wouldn't use the 1.4:1 rockers on these heads
because they don't have heavy duty springs, maybe just for little while.

Later,
