Subject: Re: [T2]curtains/extra seat??

Z Products sells a curtain kit for all years, I have them in my 68 hard top
camperwannabee.  Where are you?  If in the Pacific Northwest, got to Bry's
Wrecking in Seattle and buy or trade for a 3 person middle seat that fits on
your floor using the same holes as your 2 person seat does.
