&gt; &gt;Lowes has dropped the price on the buddy heater (Mr. Heater Portable
Propane
&gt; &gt;Heater) from $84.00 to $75.00.

&gt; Will it work in a moving vehicle? Dunno - mine shuts off if I kick it by
&gt; mistake.


I use the Buddy Heater in my bus while on the go. I've glued some of that no
slip foam material you put under area rugs and such to the feet of the
heater to keep it from sliding around. Most of the weight is low on the unit
so tipping over hasn't been a problem. It's not like I'm cornering real hard
in the bus anyway. It will kick off if I hit a hard bump or rough section of
road but I also have KYB,s so the ride is a little stiffer than stock. Over
all it works great. One drawback is the moisture that it puts out while lit.
If it's a humid day the windows will fog pretty quickly.
