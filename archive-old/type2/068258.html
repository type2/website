Subject: Exaust in cab/push rod tube seals

Thanks again to all who offered advice. I went out this morning 
and started my bus. I then walked to the rear and placed my
foot over the tailpipe. HIsssssssssss is the sound I heard
and although my idle dropped, the bus didn't die. So here
is my plan of action.
1. Drive bus w/o heat until things are righted. (I only drive
a max. of 10 min at a time in it. small town)
2. Replace leaking valve cover gaskets and push rod tube seals.
3. Locate exaust leak, and fix.
4. Using a CO detector, test me heat to see if it is still
infected. If so, attack the heat exchangers..

On the push rod tube seals, The manual shows a black one going
into the block and a white one into the head. Is this important, 
or does it really matter?
