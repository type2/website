Perry,
I did it to a 75.  I was ignorant and possibly stupid and wish i hadn't done
it.  It _is_ possibly cheaper and definitely less time/stress intensive to
convert to a carb than to rehab a 25-year old electronic FI system, but the
benefits of FI far outweigh the standard choice - the single Weber progressive
carb.

Dual carbs is the better choice, But nothing can touch FI for reliability and
performance.  The valves are smaller in the FI heads (negligible decrease in
performance) and i've heard rumors that the crank is different, but they are
unsubstantiated.

my tüsénts,
clark gordon

...A friend of a cousin of mine in Pittsburgh has a '78 camper in good shape.
He

&gt; and replaced with a carburetor [why would someone do this?]...
