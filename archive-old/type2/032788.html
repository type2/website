Good point from Sami about saving time.  Here's my response to Juan to save 
y'all some :).


Hola Juan,

Since I haven't owned a later model van with the type IV (1700-200cc) 
engine, I've forwarded your email to the type2_dot_com mailing list.  Perhaps 
someone on there more familiar with that engine can better answer your 
questions.  I will, however, offer some information from what I have heard 
from 2 liter engine owners:  It is possible for that engine to get as high 
as 250-260 degrees under the conditions you describe (hill climbing).  For 
verification, you can find more first hand information from owners of your 
type of engine in the Type2 Archive at http://vw.i405_dot_com/  (start with a 
search for &quot;oil temperature&quot;).  The consensus seems to be that 
non-synthetic oil begins to break down at around 230 degrees, so if you do 
run at temperatures higher than that, it is advisable to change your oil 
more often.

If you climb hills often, you should probably add a secondary cooler to 
bring the temperature down.  The consensus among air cooled folks is that 
the best type of cooler is the plate style (not the tube style).  If you 
have access to the VW magazines, you will see some aftermarket vendors sell 
these under the name of &quot;Mesa&quot; cooler, and it comes in various sizes.  The 
problem of course is always where to mount the cooler!  I've met with 
people who have installed a smaller Mesa style cooler just behind their 
intake air cooling scoops (in the engine compartment).  This certainly 
keeps a good flow of air over the cooler, and these people claim their oil 
temperature decreased dramatically.  However, there is the problem that the 
hot air that comes off the cooler is now getting sucked by the engine fan 
for cooling the cylinders (which it would seem make the cylinders hotter 
and subsequently the oil hotter!).  To resolve this, there are those who 
build a cooler housing in the spare battery tray that takes air ducted from 
the scoop.  It is designed so that the heated air can be ducted outside the 
engine compartment.

I've also seen coolers mounted on the side of the van, just below and 
forward of the air scoops.  If modifying the bodywork isn't a problem for 
you, this is probably an easier solution.  You might also mount the cooler 
under the van.  Since in this case the cooler would not be in an airflow 
path, you would need a 12 volt fan, perhaps activated manually by a switch 
or thermostatically controlled.

Here are a couple useful links to articles in the Type2 Archive to ponder:

Buena suerte,

&gt;sorry to bother you, but I´m not sure who can help me with my question:
&gt;I have a 1973 westfalia, 2,000 c.c engine.
&gt;Last weekend I went to a place named melgar that it is about 3 hours from 
&gt;bogota (i´m located in colombia) when I was going there I had no problem 
&gt;with my engine. temp was between (180-220 degrees aprox) it went up 
&gt;sometimes but nothing to worry about.
&gt;when I was returning to bogota the trip is mostly up hill and my engine 
&gt;was trying to run hoter than normal, and it got almost to 260 degrees, so 
&gt;I had to stop twice to let the engine cool .
&gt;I was reading your info at 
&gt;&lt;http://www.type2_dot_com/rvanness/index.htm&gt;http://www.type2_dot_com/rvanness/inde 
&gt;x.htm and I took some ideas from your page (thanks a lot) but I think I´m 
&gt;having a thermostat or reclicled air problem.
&gt;I also had the chance to read the page about cooling at 
&gt;&lt;http://www.type2_dot_com/library/cooling/coolsami.htm&gt;http://www.type2_dot_com/lib 
&gt;rary/cooling/coolsami.htm and things seems to be ok.
&gt;the only think that is wrong is that the the aux heater fan is not ducted 
&gt;to the engine. so I´m thinking to seal completly that system cause I think 
&gt;I´m recicling hot air..
&gt;also I want to install a aditional oil cooling system.
&gt;
&gt;my main quiestions are?
&gt;is it normal to get to that temperature going up in long hills??
&gt;any sugestions ??
&gt;any special model of oil cooler???
&gt;If you can help me, I really apreciate it, if not, please let me know who 
&gt;can help me.
