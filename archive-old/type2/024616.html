What do you mean buy &quot;coast&quot;?  If you mean that you take your car out of gear 
you're dead wrong about this.  The engine will get cool faster if you leave 
it in gear.  It will never get to &quot;nearly ambient&quot; though unless you're 
running without the thermostat hooked up.  That is unless you define &quot;nearly 
ambient&quot; to be 200 to 250 degrees F.
VW busses overheat.  The BEST insurance you can have that you won't be 
stranded with a dropped valve or valve seat is a properly installed, accurate 
CHT gauge.  I realize that the engines will operate for long periods of time 
with head temps in excess of 500 degrees F.  They also unexpectedly drop 
valves and valve seats.  
I don't know about other people on the &quot;list&quot; but I like to know how hot my 
engine is getting when I'm driving a car that tends to overheat and fail 
catastrophically.
