Subject: Re: [T2] Painting Valve Covers:

I kinda disagree George--any small amount of heat scavenging from the
engine won't hurt any--and not too much does this better than
aluminum----the more the merrier-so finned alum cover's can't be
detrimental---

Heat comes from air and oil vapor?

Naw--- heat is a product of something burning--- combustion or an
explosion--or friction. 

Wanna find out just how much heat get transferred to them cover's?

Lay your hand on one of them when the engine is hot--you'll find
out---:&gt;)

Finned aluminum cover's will act as heat sink, and dissipate some of the
generated heat---
I know this isn't the total answer--but it surely can't hurt anything---

Later,


Terry

How much heat do they really transfer, though? Since most of the heat
comes from air and oil vapor, there is a limited heat transfer to the
cover. Not much we can do about this, since even such actions as finning
the inside of the cover would be useless as there is little airflow
inside the covers. As another poster said, the purpose of the cover is
to hold the oil in.
