they are hard to find.  You have a few options:

Get a doghouse bug tin and add the sheet metal to fill the gap on a bus.
That's what VW did!

Try VW junkyards.  BustedBus might have one.

Cut a hole in a non-doghouse bus tin.

The exhaust hole is critical to cooling.  Don't just leave the exhaust
duct off!
