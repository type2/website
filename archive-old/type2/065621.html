Bob (Wallace),

I see now I misread your earlier post--I thought you were suggesting
loosening the nuts holding the intake manifold end castings, but reading
Bob's (Hoover) reply and rereading your earlier post, I see you were talking
about the center section (and I need to slow down before hitting the reply
button ;)  Sorry for the &quot;much ado&quot;.
