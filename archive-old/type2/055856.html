Subject: Perplexed with '69 SP SngVacAdv
Content-Disposition: inline

Hey all,

        Yep....you guessed it a problem post....yeah, I hate em, too, but
man......this is driving me nuts!  Someone out there has got to have  run
into this.

Engine:  '69 Stock SP Sing Vac Adv dizzy.  Statically timed 0 degrees 

Problem:  Suddenly, will Intermittently die after warm-up. Will restart and
idle, then die shortly after.  Pumping the gas pedal really fast seems to
suspend the dieing.  No backfire or popping when it dies.  It is not a real
abupt die either.  Let it sit about ten minutes and the problem disappears
for 3-5 minutes.  Engine temp: 180-200.  

Recent changes:  I added VDO oil temp guage and sending unit (oil drain
bolt).
                      Changed the oil.
                      Replaced burnt out dash light.

History:  Heres the kicker.  I replaced the whole Sing Vac Adv dizzy (with
different points, cap, rotor, condenser) with a spare and  resolved the
exact same problem about a month ago.

Details:     Dual fuel filters both full (new looking Brazilian fuel pump).
 
        Test light hot on ignition wire to coil. 
         I shook all wires while running at idle to check for  shorts.
         Point gap too small upon inspection (resetting to 0.18 had no
effect). 
         Plugs not black grey or brown ( replaced about a week ago).

Frustration:  I have got fuel and I have fire, but they arent working
together!  Arghhh.  I think I am going to try an electonic ignition unit I
have laying around the shop if wiring doesnt look too difficult.  I feel
like such an idiot....I guess that's where they got the name for the
idiot's guide.  Here I go again!!

take care all,
