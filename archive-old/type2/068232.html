It's considered a 8mm 12 point, I think it's also called a torx bit.
Found it a my FLAPS.

&gt; BTW, will a Torx bit fit those 12-point bolt heads?  Anyone know what
&gt; size?  If I try Torx, am I just asking for stripped bolt heads?
&gt; On the 12-point thingermajigger, if I do find a place that sells it,
&gt; what size do I need?

I installed (24) 12 points over the weekend &amp; I damaged the torx bit, 
didn't harm one bolt.  Think I'll get a better quality 12 point.
