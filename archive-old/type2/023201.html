&gt; &gt; As promised, I now have the current Issue # 3 of Volkswagen
&gt; &gt; Camper &amp; Commercial Magazine in stock. To recap, this is a
&gt; &gt; British magazine devoted exclusively to VW Campers. It has until
&gt; &gt; now been available only via overseas maiil directly from the UK.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The price is $5.95 for an issue. (It's about $8 if you order from the
&gt; &gt; publisher and you have to wait 3-4 weeks for delivery from England.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Part number is CAMPERMAG . On the website, or order toll-free.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;A few people had emailed me asking for some idea of the content of the
&gt;Volkswagen Camper &amp; Commercial Issue #3.  I had assumed that their website
&gt;would cover this, but apparantly it doesn't show much beyond a snapshot of
&gt;the cover.  So, here's a brief but incomplete listing....
&gt;
&gt;An article on VW Bulli Sonderausfuhrengen (&quot;Special Models&quot;) trucks, with
&gt;pictures and ad copy
&gt;A feature on a '66 poptop camper (a Canturbury's-Pitt Motor-Caravan
&gt;conversion)
&gt;A feature on an '89 Reimo-conversion poptop camper
&gt;Part 2 in a series on rebuilding the wasserboxer engine
&gt;An article with color photos of a complete frame-up restoration of a '72 bus
&gt;An article on repairing body rot on Busses
&gt;Coverage of several VW shows with a ton of pics of VW campers of all ages
&gt;that are unlike any sold here
&gt;Tons of color photos throughout, plus the requisite classifieds, letters,
&gt;etc.
&gt;ads from European parts houses (maybe you can give me some ideas of what to
&gt;import!)
&gt;
&gt;This magazine is definately enjoyable reading, even if just to see what our
&gt;lucky friends &quot;across the pond&quot; get to enjoy.
&gt;Highly recommended..
