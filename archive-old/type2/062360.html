So I wrote:
Here we go again indeed. Was it here, or on the aircooled VW usenet group
where we had a lengthy discussion? I'll cut to the chase: Many reliable folks
say that Americans measure octane different than Germans, and 87 octane at a 
US pump is 90 octane as Germans reckon it. VW manual says use 90 octane plus, 
but that means 87+ at the American gas pump. So 87 meets VW's minimum spec.

I've been watching my gas mileage for years and concluded that I did 2-3 mpg 
better with 92 octane Supreme than with 87 octane unleaded. So I've bought 92
octane expensive gas for years.

Last  summer my wife and I drove all around the southwest in our 78 Westy. She's
been burning 87 octane in her car forever, and she's an accountant, and we had
a lot of time on our hands, so we tracked it with 87, 89, and 92 octane and 
concluded:

1- Gas mileage was best with 92, less good with 89 and least good with 87.
2- We got the most miles per dollar with 89, then with 92, then with 87.
3- It didn't ping on any of them, as far as we could tell. 

It's hard to control for all the variables of road conditions. elevation, etc.
so there's always noise in the data. Collect some data of your own, do the 
math and have fun. Report back when you've got some numbers.

Drive safely,
Surfer Bob

PS- The thing that improves my mileage more than any gas choice is 
DRIVING SLOWLY. It's kind of dangerous to go 55 mph on San Diego freeways
where everyone's merging around you at 75, but driving 70 mph takes 5mpg
off my mileage easy. Probably has a lot to do with the wonderful aerodynamics
of that loaf-shaped profile.
