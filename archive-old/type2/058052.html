&gt;        anyone know of any good camping, pref. with scenic hiking, etc in
&gt;the NY, NJ, PA area? I guess southern CT as well...thx, jim

Jim,

I live in SE PA and will be glad to offer these PA ideas:
(We have a lot of destination ideas but we have made these
   sites this year)

Our family has had an excellent camping summer with 
our '73 Westy! 

We live north of Phily, and have camped this summer at
1) Hickory Run S.P. = great hiking, boulder field, 
                swimmin in lake, wading under waterfall.
        location: Central East PA, _at_PA turnpike 476 crosses Rt 80

2) French Creek S.P. = by historic Hopewell Furnace
                 hiking, frisbee golf 
        location: SE PA,  PA turnpike exit 22 or 23

3) Pine Grove Furnace = historic site, swimming, hiking
       location: S Central PA (easy for northbounders from Md) near Rt15

4) We also headed for Rickett's Glenn in NE PA but found it full.
   We ended up at World's End S.P., and had an excellent time!
    Both are great northern destinations.

     location: NE PA west of Scranton. 

PA State Parks now have a reservation system that takes some of the 
stress out of getting a site. (vs first-come, first-serve).

We keep copies of the camp ground layouts with notes for friends
and future visits. Drop me a line if you want more info.

Note: we've kept to S.Parks but there are a lot of private sites too.
I do not have any information to offer on them.

(we have been advised to try Elk Neck S.P. in Md but have not 
made it there yet.)

Let us know if your in the area, and maybe we'll see you camping
or be able to meet and share coffee. 

Happy Hunting,

Mike Dulany
Chalfont, PA
