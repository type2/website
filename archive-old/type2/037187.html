Subject: Type 4 conversion-MSHP knows how to do it

Norm at Mark Stephens HP is very interested in this and knows EVERYTHING
about how to do the job. The Type4 engine is a much stronger, more powerful
and more reliable engine. The europeans have been putting type 4 engines in
early buses for years. I own a 71 bus and have looked into it myself.
MSHP's number is 661-822-5678
