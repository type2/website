&gt;Okay..that is what it does.  What does it look like??  Anyone ever seen 
&gt;one of these things?

Probably a black rubber hose about 10&quot; long with a fitting on each 
end.  VDO makes it.

I should mention that this hose failed on me last year.  After about 12 
years of use, the end nearest the engine had become somewhat rigid from the 
heat and started leaking, then failed catestrophically when I tugged on 
it.  If you use one of these, check it every once in a while.
