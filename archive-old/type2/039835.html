&gt; Well, h_at_ll. I've got three other settings on my cute little multimeter
&gt; from Radio Shack:
a little arrow,

?? not sure what this is...

a K(omega),

This is ohms. Never test ohms resistance in a circuit with power in
it....you will blow the meter, usually before the fuse in the meter blows!

 and CONT.

This is also ohms resistance. It helps when you are looking for a complete
circuit or a short to ground and you don't want to look at the meter. It
makes an audible sound.

I tried it on
&gt; all of them, and got a zero reading on each. Is that good news, or am I
&gt; doing something wrong?

You may have blown your meter....
It doesn't sound like your 'multi meter' offers milliamps.
