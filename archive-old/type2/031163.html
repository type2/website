&gt; I am looking at replacing the exhaust on my '77 and noticed that parts for 
&gt; the stock system seemed to be difficult to obtain. I have an exhaust leak 
&gt; somewhere that causes my bus to backfire on heavy deceleration, and this 
&gt; makes me VERY unhappy. I understand that this can cause lots of problems 
&gt; (broken air intake sensor, destroyed valves, etc). 

Please note an exhaust backfire cannot harm your air flow sensor.  Only a
backfire through the intake system can do that.


&gt;I did find one hole in 
&gt; the muffler that I have patched, however the problem has not gone away. Any 
&gt; suggestions on how to figure out where the leak is coming from so I can 
&gt; keep driving her until I get the new exhaust. She is my daily driver now 
&gt; which just complicates the situation.
&gt; 

One trick is to start the engine and then block the tailpipe with a
stuffed up rag (make sure the engine's not real hot before you try this)
and listen for where the exhaust is hissing out of the system.  Helps if
you have 2 people to do this trick so you can be underneath searching for
the leak while someone else blocks the pipe.  If the engine stalls when
the pipe is blocked, you don't have an exhaust leak.

Other things can cause backfiring too -- improper ignition timing and too
rich a fuel mixture can do it too.


&gt; What are the ramifications both legally and in terms of performance of 
&gt; getting rid of the EGR filter?
&gt; 
&gt; I have just recently moved to Sacramento, and have yet to register my bus 
&gt; here. It is a federal bus, but my concern is that California will balk if I 
&gt; have modified the exhaust system in this way. When I sniffed it in AZ it 
&gt; passed with flying colors, but they just check for CO2 and HC. Does anybody 
&gt; know if CA checks for NOx?

You will not pass California smog inspection if you remove the EGR.  There
is a visual inspection where you will be failed immediately if any of the
emissions control equipment is missing.  You can bet they check for NOx in
the tailpipe emissions test too.  Since your Bus is a federal model I
think California will take a $300 smog impact fee (or did they stop doing
that recently?) because it's not a CA model and you will still of course
have to pass emissions inspections.


&gt; 
&gt; Performance wise I would think that the lack of EGR would increase 
&gt; performance but cause the bus to run hotter. I understand from the archives 
&gt; that it is almost impossible to buy a new EGR valve, and it is impossible 
&gt; if you aren't independently wealthy. Is this correct?
&gt; 

I can't see anyone wanting/needing a new EGR valve.  The valve doesn't
really go bad, it's the filter that is usually missing or rusted out.  The
filter connects between the exhaust and the pipe that runs to the valve
inside the engine compartment.  Filters used to be hard to find but now
are readily available from vendors such as Bus Depot.  They aren't
necessarily cheap (figure about $100) but they are available.


&gt; I have also recently been noticing a slightly irregular idle. That is, it 
&gt; fluctuates slightly around where it decides to idle, and it also decides to 
&gt; idle at slightly different places. Sometimes it idles at 850, and some 
&gt; times it will idle as high as 1100. I have been searching for the cause of 
&gt; this, but have not tracked it down yet. Possibilities that I have run 
&gt; across are too much end play, and a faulty EGR valve. The end play I intend 
&gt; to check when I do the exhaust, but that may be a month or two off due to 
&gt; cash flow right now. If it is the EGR valve and I stop up the hose will the 
&gt; irregularity disappear? Any other suggestions for why I would see this, or 
&gt; how to correct it?
&gt;
If your EGR system is open to the air, you are creating a HUGE vacuum leak
which will cause some serious driveability problems.  The EGR should not
be active when the engine is at idle or full throttle but if the valve is
misadjusted then it's possible.  Go over your EGR system and make sure
that it is either closed to the atmosphere (i.e. all pieces intact and
sealed) or that the inlet to the valve or pipe has been blocked off
somehow so it's not just sucking air.  

That may or may not have anything to do with your idle fluctuating, but a
good start is to replace all vacuum hoses and do an ignition tuneup and
timing adjustment if you haven't in a while.
