Subject: Horn Buttons Thanks To All

Thanks to all for the advise on my horn button. You were all correct in
the fact that I was prying on the metal ring. Fortunately not hard
enough to do any damage. With all of your collective knowledge I figured
if it don't move easy I better ask the list. I'll try to remove it in
the morning.

Spent today rebuilding the crank that's going into my bus's engine. My
luck held, all journals are on the good side of tolerance. No regrind
needed here! Rented a pilot bearing puller from the FLAPS. Worked GREAT!
Had that puppy out in a matter of minutes. If all goes well I'll Seal
the case tomorrow. Need to wait for new exhaust studs to arrive before
the heads go back on though. Hopefully the turtlebus will live again
before the snow falls in Northern Az.

Thanks so much to all. You make this project fun.
Tom
