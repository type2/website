Subject: Re: [T2] Definition of a VW Cultist

Hi Don.  I'm definitely a VW cultist.  Just let me know when you want to schedule the mass suicide. :)  
  
  I took a look at the Gaucamole Bus today.  NICE!  Question though, you said, &quot;I  was afraid to leave it like that though for fear of overheating the  heads due to too lean a mixture.&quot;  How does one determine the  correct mixture?  I have to run mine pretty lean to keep it from  dieseling.  (Single Weber).  How much does it affect head  temperatures?  Other than that, the Bopmobile runs great.   Thanks...KR

humorous. (My goal is 2.)

Definition of a cult, as applies to Bus ownership:

A cultist is one who has a strong belief in the Bentley Manual and John
Muir; who frequently attends Fix-It parties and Bus campouts; who has a high
level of financial giving to an air cooled cause; who schools their children
in the proper use of a wrench; who has accumulated survival foods and has a
strong belief in the ability to fix anything wrong with his/her Bus on the
side of the road; and who distrusts newer water cooled vehicles. Any of
these may qualify (a person as a VW Bus cultist) but certainly more than one
would cause us to strongly look at this person as a threat to modern
automakers, and his family as being in a risk situation that qualified for
rides in &quot;normal&quot; vehicles provided by family and friends when &quot;The Bus&quot; is
again broken down.
