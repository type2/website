For manuals the best by far is the original factory manual, published by
Bentley. You can order directly from them. Thats what i did when i got my
'77 Riviera camper about a month ago.

http://www.bentleypublishers_dot_com/product.htm?code=V279

This also goes over the Westfalia campers.

they also have the owners manual for the '77 type2
http://www.bentleypublishers_dot_com/product.htm?code=R277

There is also the famous &quot;How to keep your Volkswagen alive&quot; book, this
one goes in depth more on how to do things.

http://www.amazon_dot_com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1562614800/qid=988039751/sr=1-1/ref=sc_b_2/002-4232328-7499249

and if your planing on doing any internal engine work i would also get
&quot;how to rebuild your Volkswagen air-cooled engine&quot;
http://www.amazon_dot_com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0895862255/ref=sim_books/002-4232328-7499249

I would stay away from oil additives, Most are generaly crap, are there is
no real way to tell if helping or hurting. Thats how they get away with
selling them. Even if one was the cure all that they say, they are
designed for water cooled motors and may reduce the cooling properties of
an oil cooled/air cooled motor. Also stay away from synthetics, they do not
transfer heat like traditional oils and will result in higher head temps.

Also, I'm not to familiar with Westfalia, but when you say external pump,
do you mean electricly operated? I don't think Westfalia came with an
electric pump in '77, if it is electric maybe you have a different kind of
camper.

&gt; I did it! I took the plunge and am now the owner of a 77 Westfalia
&gt; Campmobile. I have started the renovation first by simply cleaning her up.
&gt; I am in need of some parts but primarily I am interested in a good service
&gt; manual. Does anyone have a lead? Also, my next step is to change the oil
&gt; and filters etc... Is there an oil treatemnet or addative that is
&gt; recomended for air cooled engines? I want to start with the simple things.
&gt; It seems like there are alot of disconnected wires hanging around. This
&gt; model camper has the stove, sink (with external pump), refridgerator (does
&gt; anyone know if this refridge is propane fueled -  how I may find out?). I
&gt; suppose these wires at one time were ment to opperate these features but
&gt; now hang uselessly waiting for someone to really love this poor neglected
&gt; van. I need some handles for the cabinet doors - the ones thaat have the
&gt; little button that you push to open...
&gt; Your help is super appreciated,
