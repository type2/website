Hey guys,
Time to clean up my folks' basement.  Getting rid of some VW parts left over
from the Karmann Ghia days :-)

I have a crankshaft from a '74 1600cc Type 1 engine w/ 85K miles on it.
It's in good shape, but mildly worn, i.e. it would need turning before
installation in another engine.  Anybody that wants it can have it, it's
located in Fairfax VA.  If you want to pick it up, great.  If you want me to
ship it, I will but it's heavy and you will pay shipping.  This crank is an
original VW crank, never turned.  This engine had 85K miles from new when I
had to rebuild it.  I wound up buying a new crank for the rebuild rather
than turning the old since I had to have the case align-bored at the time
too.

While I'm at it, I have a set of 5 Volkswagen &quot;baja&quot; style wheels.  These
are Volkswagen steel wheels that came on a special edition of the Beetle in
the early 1970s.  They are the same size as stock VW steel wheels of that
period.  All wheels are bare and could use a coat of paint.  Also included
is a set of West Coast Metric plastic center caps.  Make me an offer on
these, they are taking up the most space.  I really don't think it would be
a great idea to ship these.  Also located in Fairfax, VA.
These wheels will fit late (not wide-five) Beetle, Super Beetle, Karmann
Ghia, and Type 3 (maybe also Type 4).
