Subject: Re: [T2] lifting my type4

I'm not sure just what holes you're talking about but I'd be leery of
lifting an engine in a patently safe way.  (Safe for you and safe for the
engine.)  A long block can easily be lifted by two people so find a friend
that's willing to help (one of the best &quot;tools&quot; ever invented) and go that
route, if you can.  If you must use a block and tackle set up I'd try to
&quot;sling&quot; the engine somehow.   I've lifted a fully &quot;dressed&quot; engine with a
&quot;come along&quot; type hand winch with attachments to the ends of the engine
carrier and the lower case/transmission studs.  You might also try
&quot;slinging&quot; a sheet of plywood under the engine.

Subject: [T2] lifting my type4


&gt; Can I lift the engine by those two holes in the case - the one by the
&gt; breather and the other by the manifold?  I need to get the engine off of
&gt; my engine stand and I'd like to lift it off with some rope and pullies.
