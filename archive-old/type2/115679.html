&gt; Sounds like you need to run some serious injector cleaner through

&gt; closed.

The folks who clean injectors for a living tell me that fuel injector
cleaner is a double edged sword. When the insides of the fuel lines have
varnish build-up and you use the cleaner too regularly that stuff flakes off
and ends up in the injector. T or F?
