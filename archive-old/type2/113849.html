Sorry but that's more like 1,700-1,800lbs empty for the Metro.  A significant amount of weight and more than a stock bus can safely tow (according to VW, at least).  Don't expect your insurance company to pay the liability claim when you get into an accident while towing.  Ask yourself this: is it worth a $200K judgement against you?  If you say &quot;yes&quot;, then you are &quot;braver&quot; than I am.
