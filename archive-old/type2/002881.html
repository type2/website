Thanks for all your help on replacing the fuel sender without cutting a hole
or removing the engine.  I will be changing the sender in the next two weeks
and I will let you know the outcome.

My next problem is that the PO damaged the oil drain plug/hole.  I changed
the oil for the first time on Sunday and when I put the plug back in it
would never get tight.  It would start to tighten then suddenly get loose
again.  The bolt looks ok and the hole seems ok as well.  What is the best
solution to this?

Thanks,
