If you want to carry passengers back there, then yes, they are necessary.

&gt;My 73 has none besides the driver and passenger front
&gt;seats, no belts in the back.

But it DOES have seatbelt mounting points.  They are hidden under
white or black plastic, large, Phillips head bolts.

I went to a wrecking yard, and looking only in modern Audi and VW
cars, got several sets of back seat seatbelts.  The retractable parts
I used on the front seats, and the middle seat seatbelts, on the
two &quot;seats&quot; on the folding bed.
