Subject: Re: Kadrons on a 72-79 Bus.

Hi,
&gt;From what I've heard from my friends at Mark Stephens High Performance
who build lots of type4 engines...you really run a great risk of burning
up your engine by running too lean. The ONLY way I would even try it would be
to install a fuel/air meter and jet them (you can get jets from Gene Berg)
so you are running at 14.7 to 13. I'm running Kadrons on my 1776 and they
run great but when I get my 2.4L I will switch to webers.

&gt;I wast looking over my 74 bus motor last night and did some thinking. I
have a set of Kadrons for my Bug that I won't need for a few months and
started playing around with the idea of putting them on the 74 Bus. I asked
if there are any Manifolds made for this and there are not. The carbs are
cheaper than dual Webers and even cost less than having your 32/34 PDSIT's
redone. So to make them work I would need to make some manifolds. This I
can do. I would also have to modify the Bug linkage, I can do that also. I
know that the Kadrons have no choke and that would be a little problem for
the colder climates. If I could get this set-up working on my Bus, would
there be any intrest in having some manifolds Cast? I will have to check
and see if Iron or Aluminum would be cheaper and what the cost would be. 
&gt;  Please give any feed back you have, I like the Kadrons and think they
would be a good replacement for the stock carbs for a stock motor. I know
that they will not work on a perfomance type 4, but if you have you will
not be looking to save money anyway. I have put a lot of thought into this
and could use some insight into areas I have not explored.Thanks
