O.k. So I saw some on this once a while ago in the archive but could not
find it again.  Today the archive seems not to be working and I plan on
doing this project over the weekend so here is my appeal to you all.

I have the kit of seals and stuff and I know what I have to do, but my
question is how an I going to get the piston out of the cylinder??  It
seems like a lot of pressure will be required for this.  is this right?
Or will I be able to lift it out with my hands.  Then when I am done will
It slide back in with ease or does it have to be &quot;sucked in&quot;?

Thanks in advance for any help.  Also if you have any suggestions fo
rthings I should watch out for  please let me know.

Thanks,
Kevin Fox
