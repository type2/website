Subject: Re: [T2] Brake pedal bump stop help needed 70 bus

a cheapo tacky way to deal with this is to do like I did and snake a 1/4 
size hose about 2 inches long down through one hole and back up the other 
hole, it at least stopped the pedal from banging.

&gt;Hiya Adam,
&gt;
&gt;Yeah!  I'd like to know where you found a new one too!
&gt;
&gt;I had to do this little chore on my Bus last year. Really had to scrounge the
&gt;boneyards to find one of those little buggers in good shape.
&gt;
&gt;I got mine in by doing the following.  I had a friend below hold the stop and
&gt;position it so that the &quot;prongs&quot; were started in the holes.  Oh, by the way,
&gt;just prior to this we had sprayed the prongs with Tri-Flow, a lubricant.
&gt;Anyway he pushed up on the stop and from above I grabbed the tip of the prong
&gt;with a pair of needle nose pliers and pulled.  Gotta be careful not to break
&gt;the rubber at this point - take it nice and easy.  Do a little gentle side to
&gt;side circular kinda motions and it will pop up and into place.  It is a tight
&gt;fit though!
