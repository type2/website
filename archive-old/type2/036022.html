Subject: Re: Brake drum saga continues...

Having not read the beginning of this thread, I may be WAY out in left
field, but an old trick that I've used over the years is to loosen the
nut that holds the drum to the axle one turn (no more!) and replace the
cotter pin.  Then drive the beast for a day or two.  (Carry a wrench
that fits the nut with you.) You'll hear/feel it when it breaks loose.
Stop, remove the cotter pin and tighten the nut to &quot;snug&quot;.  Put the
cotter pin back in, continue your journey and resume drum removal at
your earliest convenience.

Jim
