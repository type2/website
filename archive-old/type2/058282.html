Subject: DaddyBus back on da road...

Well, buttoned everything up, polarized the generator [whee!! that's fun!]
and hoisted the old 1600 back into place. Inasmuch as it's midweek, I wasn't
able to badger any of the usual suspects to manhandle the engine [which
could be a good thing...my old boss once dropped the darn thing on my
head.....], it was just the wife and I. Bless her soul...she keeps saying
she hates busses [her dad had one in the 60's which seemed to break down all
the time], always says this is the last time she's gonna help with an
engine, but we got it in with a minimum of strain....she doesn't handle well
that point where everything is lined up straight and square, but the darn
thing won't go in.... at least the splines lined up square the first time,
so there wasn't that annoying last quarter-inch that just won't go...

The rest of the afternoon was spent diagnosing why the deck lid is so hard
to open..seems the apron is riding up a bit on the rear crossmember, raising
the apron just enough to make it hard for the latch to raise high enough to
clear the tab on the apron. Can't really tell why, maybe something's a bit
out of square. Anyway, if I loosen the crossmember, tighten down the apron,
then tighten the crossmember, it seems to be ok, although that doesn't seem
to be the permanent answer...but it doesn't involve grinding or bending, so
we'll let it ride.

There are no thermostats to be had in Aridzona [yeah yeah, a voice crying in
the wilderness], so I reinstalled the one that had failed in the open
position and will order another next time I order something from somebody
[like a CV boot].

Tomorrow I'll try and pound the kink outta the rear bumper, adjust the rear
brakes [linings getting a bit thin, as seen from the inside, and the pedal's
about halfway down], and maybe install the front door panels I got for
Father's day [the current ones have these holes in the bottom from where I
took out the cheap speakers when I installed the Sapphire I bought a couple
of years ago].

Thanks to all who sent me words of encouragement after my funk the other
night.

Will see if I can talk the wife into getting up at 0500 Saturday to go to
Jerome. Wish me luck.
