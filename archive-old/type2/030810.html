	Thanks, Tom Young, Paul Ledbetter, E J, Douglas, Jarrett, and
other folks in Texas AIRS for their suggestions designed to alleviate a
minor crisis. 
	I'm in the middle of my first rebuild, with HEAVY technical
assistance and advice from Brian Lanahan and Jeff's Bug Shop here in
Houston. Our landlord, nice fellow but market-driven, bumped up the rent
over a hundred bucks, and we gave notice last month. We married the case
halves on Wednesday night, sealing in a reground crank, new cam, bearings,
and absurdy clean surfaces (we boiled everything in concentrated trisodium
phosphate for an hour, and scoured afterwards with carb cleaner).
Unfortunately, Wednesday afternoon I snuck the used 2.0 pistons into the
lab where I work to weigh them, and found about a thirty-gram difference.
After entertaining messing with the pistons by shaving, or thinning out
the inside of the wrist pins (an excellent suggestion by Douglas, but not
real feasible), I opted to freak out and call everyone who came to mind in
the area who might have some leftover pistons that I could play with. Most
of Texas AIRS were scurrying around their closets and making phone calls
for me, to which I am indebted.  We didn't have much success, other than
local shops who were charging inbetween three and four hundred bucks for a
complete set of P&amp;Cs with rings, which was something I could not afford.
	For an hour or two I was looking at the possibility of towing an
engineless bus to a new apartment and dealing with it later, which sucked,
when Lanahan came through with the news that AVP in Sacramento had single
pistons for $15. Groovy. They weighed them for me (all four are within 3
g), and tossed in wrist pins and keeper clips to boot. Tom, I'm sorry I
didn't get your message until today, as I like the idea of getting them
from a listee, but the box came in this morning, and, with luck, the
pistons and rings will be in place tonight, and the heads bolted on for a
possible installation tomorrow.
	I've been without transport for two months now. I'm pretty
excited. Now if I can only start heeding these posts about heating ...
