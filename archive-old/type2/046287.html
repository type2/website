Subject: [T2] relocating battery in 72 bus

After many years of fine service, the battery in the 1972 bus is giving up
the ghost. It is really time to relocate it to the left side of the engine
room becuase there isn't really any battery tray left. Has anyone done this?
Any suggestions for running the hot and ground strap?
