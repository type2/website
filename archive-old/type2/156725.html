Subject: Dirty fuel filter = loss of power?

List,

(76 w/ 79 CA engine)

A week ago I was losing power on the way home from work, engine did not die,
but when stepping on it, I had no thrust.  It died on me after two more
attempt of limping home.

Traditionally this has indicated a clogged fuel filter for me.

Today I replaced a nasty fuel filter (I always cut them open) and tried to
start the bus and it would not stay running.  Slipping into despair, I put my
fuel pressure gauge on the T between 3/4 injectors to begin trouble shooting
and got a solid 30psi.

After a few more cranks, Eureka!  Back to idling with my usual smoothness.  I
guess the pump just needed awhile to reprime the fuel ring.

An interesting test would have been to put the gauge on with the bad filter
and see the pressure loss.

Test run tomorrow.

Only two things have ever sidelined my bus:

Dirty fuel filters.
Dead coil.
