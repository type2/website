It always tickles me to read those messages posted by list members who are
venturing out on their first trip away from home; you know: the ones that
say they are embarking on a big 150-mile trip into the great unknown.  My
'72 Westy, Roconante, makes a trip 1,000 miles into Mexico from East Texas
at least twice a year; this in addition to being a daily driver.  This is
our first trip report.

I believe of the ten essential tools to carry on these trips is a laptop
computer.

Last December Roconante left out of Shreveport, Louisiana at dawn headed
for Mexico again.  I noted three or four muted hiccups at highway speed,
but otherwise Roconante cruised uneventfully for 300 miles before lunch.
The weather was clear and in the seventies.  We pushed due south along the
highway at 70mph plus because of warning that a severe arctic cold front
was bringing ice and snow.

Back on the interstate after eating, and another 100 miles down the road,
the engine quietly died.  A roadside examination showed the fuel and
electrical systems to be okay, but there was no compression in two cylinders.

At that moment the unpredictable Texas weather intervened as the cold front
passed through dropping the balmy seventy degree temperature below freezing
in less than ten minutes.  The freezing temperature we could withstand, but
the steady 40mph wind we could not.  Roconante had the courtesy to die 300
yards from the Mariott Hotel, so another ten minutes later we were out of
the wind and checked into the hotel.

I immediately plugged in my laptop to post a message to the list asking for
recommendations of mechanics in Austin, Texas.  This is where the list
really showed its worth to me.  Before bedtime, I had received some dozen
responses on the list and via personal email.  Several sent troubleshooting
tips, one list member 15 miles away offered to come if needed, and best of
all three of the list members who recommended mechanics recommended the
same one.

The next morning I was on the phone to Toby at Underground VW in Austin.
Over the phone he guessed at what would later prove to be correct, that for
two cylinders on opposite sides of the engine to instantly go from normal
to zero compression, the cam shaft must not be turning.

The next day, Roconante was towed 20 miles over icy highways to Underground
VW north of downtown Austin.  The garage is located in a small facility on
the old main highway in a warehouse and industrial district.  Charlie Ford
probably described the place in better detail, but suffice it to say they
had three bay windows and several bugs parked in front under the sign which
reads &quot;Underground VW, Metaphysical Volkswagen Maintenance and Repair.&quot;  I
knew I was at the right place.

Fast forward now from December to the first of March.  Toby had a local
engine machine shop with VW expertise build me an entirely new engine.
Toby and Underground VW proved to be reputable and completely honest, but
as with most mechanics if you do not call them for a month, they usually do
not move for a month.  It took some polite prodding by phone to get the job
finished.

With the new engine installed, all was well.  Roconante has since made
several of those 150 mile journeys, and one 2,400 mile trip to Mexico City
and back.

The only engine-related mechanical problem is that one of the oil galley
plugs popped out.  I now recommend welding all of these in place while the
engine is out.  The welds can always be drilled out if necessary, but
having one of the plugs pop out unexpectedly is quite an inconvenience.

Thanks to everyone for all the good advice, and thanks to everyone who
contributes to this resourse.
