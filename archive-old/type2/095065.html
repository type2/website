Subject: Re: [T2] Can't increase vacuum



Using  Bentley’s nominal pressure regulator  numbers, I calculated the 
nominal idle air manifold vacuum (in.Hg)  (on a stock FI 1975 through 1979 
VW bus) to be 14.42 in.Hg.  This is approximatly what I measured on  my 1977 
stock bus at 900 RPM.

Bentley  states the nominal open loop  fuel pressure = 35 psi. (I define 
open loop as the condition where the vacuum hose is disconnected from the 
fuel pressure regulator and plugged.)

Bentley  states the nominal Nominal closed loop fuel pressure = 28 psi (I 
define closed  loop is the condition where the vacuum hose is connected  to 
the fuel pressure regulator for normal operation).

With 35psi (open) and 28psi (closed) the nominal  air manifold pressure drop 
is 7psi.

The conversion factor from psi to in.Hg  (vacuum) is 2.06. Then 2.06 X 7psi 
= 14.42 in.Hg.
