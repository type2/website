Hey There Volks,

My 78 Westy (auto trans) was totaled, and I bought it back from the
insurance company. I've grabbed some things, sold some interior
parts, and don't have an immediate use for the engine. Figured I'd
offer it to here before posting ads on the internet. 

The bus is located in Fall River, Ma. (crossroads: Route 195 and 24).


- Engine runs and is still installed in bus, hear it run, check
compression, (#1-120,#2-125,#3-100,#4-130 when last checked). 
- #3 lifter is ticking (I don't know why - haven't even opened the
valve covers), 127k miles on bus, unknown miles on engine.
- No heat exchangers (PO installed j-tube replacement pipes).
- #1 pushrod tubes leak.
- I'd like to keep the FI stuff (ECU, AFM, double relay, fuel pump)
as spares for my 79 Westy.

I'm not trying to make a fortune off it, just trying to cover the
difference between what the insurance company gave me and what I had
invested. I'd like to get $400 (or best *reasonable* offer) for the
engine/trans without the FI stuff (you pull engine/trans). I would
also consider selling a &quot;turnkey&quot; engine (with the FI stuff), or
selling the bus complete as I have the MA title. Make an offer.

Thanks in Advance,
