Subject: mechanical fuel pump fun
Message-ID: &lt;717e221c.24562697_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

(i have a 1972 1700cc Pancake, twin weber carbs) Everyone seems to be telling 
me how often eletric fuel pumps break down and that they are so loud, 
although i can't see how it could possible be heard over the engine noise, 
ANYWAY, when i took out the old pushrod it was much shorter than the new one 
I received, how would the rod being shorter cause a problem with the fuel 
pump?  And why when I installed the new one did the pump stop working all 
together?  I ordered a Brazilian $20 or so pump from the BusDepot, should I 
have ordered the $130 one so I can have one that works for more than a few 
months.  Also I'm confused about how far out the push rod is supposed to 
stick out when at the high point past the flange,  in the service manual it 
says .2 inches, another person tells me 1/2&quot;.  Maybe the prev owner ground 
down the flange to make the short beaten push rod stick out further?  I'm 
sick of this reoccuring problem, should I just order a new flange, gaskets, 
pushrod, and pump (but which one?!) and replace all that crap?

Thanks for help,
Shawn
