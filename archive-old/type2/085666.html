Subject: Re: [T2] Double relay resistor R1.

Hi Chuck,

Me again. I traced out the circuit and understand it much better now. I am 
suspecting a fried resistor R1. I verified the relay by applying 12 V to 86, 
86a, 86b, and 86c. 86b failed to close the relay. 86b is the terminal 
connected to the R1 circuit. I verified my outputs 88a, 88b, 88c, and 88d. 
They all passed except when using 86b. Just out of curiousity I did some 
impedance measurements. Heres what I found.

86 to 85   1.4M ohms
86a to 85  1.4M ohms
86b to 85  209 ohms
86c to 85  1.85M ohms

86b to 85 is the path that contains R1. To me this seems very low. This 
would point to the toasted resistor. Now I need to find the value of R1 and 
replace it.

Thanks,

Matt

Hi Chuck,

Do you happen to know the value of resistor R1 in the double relay circuit?
Also what wattage must it be? (1/4 W? 1/2 W?) Mine shows signs of heating.
The insulation is a little baked.

Thanks,

Matt

Matt,

Think of the two relays as the power latch and the pump. pin 85 is the
common(ground) for both relays.

12 V applied to 86 or 86a or 88a should energize the pump relay ( 88y is
closed to 88d and 88c). 88d and 88c are tied together.

12V applied to 86c should energize the latch relay (close 88z to 88b and
88a) 88b and 88a are tied together.

In the run state both relay are energized. the latch is held on by the
ignition on switch. The pump is held on by the combination of the latch
relay and the closed switch in the air flow box (pins 36 and 39).

Can't send schematic as my scanner is down.

Chuck

&gt;
&gt;Can anyone tell me how to test the double relay? I am having trouble
&gt;understanding it's layout and my manual does not go into detail on it. Does
&gt;anybody have a schematic?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
