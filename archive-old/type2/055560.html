Subject: Headliner install

Have any of you listees in Colorado ever installed a headliner?  It sure would help to have someone with 
previous experience help out with one.
I'm in the Denver area and would go as far as Boulder or maybe even Colorado Springs for some help. 

Thanks, Joel '79 transporter
