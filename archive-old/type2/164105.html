&gt;What do mean?  Not in cereal boxes.   The web site is awesome !!!

kellog's has various cars from the movie in cereal boxes... you know, 
frosted flakes, froot loops, etc. a neighbor kept leaving the cars on 
our porch. we have like 6 of the tow truck now.
ny times had an article on pixar and this movie, and i saw the bus - 
next time at the supermarket, i checked out a box of kellog's crud. 
SIX cars to collect, NONE of them the bus.

stupid kellog's.
