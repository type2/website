Subject: 78 Westy Oil Problem

Last November, I bought a 1978 Green VW Westfalia that had been sitting 
in a field for about 2 years.  I have learned that shortly before it was 
parked, new cylinders and pistons were installed.  The bus had an oil 
leak after the new pistons, etc. and the owner, out of frustration, 
parked it.  I pulled the bus out and got it cranked.  It seemed to run 
okay but I soon noticed it pumping oil out of the dipstick tube.  It 
also apparently has a bad turn signal switch, any suggestions where to 
find another one?.
        The bus had factory a/c which has been disconnected, the 
compressor is just lying on the left side of the engine, where the 
other battery goes.  There is a cut out of the sheet metal on the left 
side of the engine, apparently where the compressor used to be. Is it 
harmful to run the engine with this sheet metal missing.
        I'm dying to get it on the road.  The VW mechanics I have asked 
about it have chuckled when I mention the year model and the type 4 
engine and have been no help.
        As an aside, my brother bought the twin bus to mine about 2 
months ago[his runs fine]. My bus is one month older than his. We hope 
to caravan when I get mine running.
        All help will be greatly appreciated.
