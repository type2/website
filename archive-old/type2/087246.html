Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Tee fitting.


Good advice as you already have a major part of the job done...engine out!

Figure about 1.5 hr to get the old fuel tank out.

Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt;I'm getting ready to install a 2L fuel injected engine into 
&gt; &gt;my 74' bus. I know the fuel tank has to have an return line 
&gt; &gt;but I heard of putting a Tee fitting to the outlet. Will this 
&gt; &gt;work? Has anybody done this? I have the fuel tank for a fuel 
&gt; &gt;injected set-up, but if I a tee fitting will work I'd rather 
&gt; &gt;not swap tanks.
&gt; 
&gt; Swap the tanks.  You'll be a lot happier knowing you set this up right.  This 
&gt; question has come up a couple times before and I always make this same 
&gt; observation:  With the return going into the tank (where it's supposed to go) 
&gt; you are using your tank to cool the gas that is coming back from your VERY hot 
&gt; engine compartment.  With the T-fitting, you are recirculating the already-hot 
&gt; gas and making it hotter.  Live in Alaska?  Maybe not a problem.  Drive in 90+ 
&gt; degree weather?  Plan on vapor lock.
