Hi Erik:
I'm glad I'm not the only one with the &quot;mystery switch&quot;.  Is your bus a
'77?  This switch was the bane of my life this last month.  Couldn't get
past emmissions test due to high C O (rich mixture).  I tore through the
entire EFI system looking for the problem.  Everything checked out fine.  I
welded on an O 2 sensor to check mixture ratios and sure enough it was
richer than h*ll.  After changing the tension on the poteniometer spring
(AFM) did'nt solve the problem, I gave up for a couple of weeks.  When I
went back to it, I looked at that stupid switch and said your the only
thing I haven't checked.  Sure enough, flipped it over and the O 2 sensor
readings took a nosedive.  Evidently, when I had replaced the original
switch which rattled away, I must of put the label &quot;high/low&quot; on wrong.

&gt;I have one of those toggle switches! I've always wondered what it was.
&gt;Any idea how to determine High / Low position.?

Did your label rattle right off?   I've yet to test the d*mn thing to see
if &quot;high&quot; is on or off.

The only documentation I've found on this switch is a referrence to the
Altitude Compensator mentioned in the lists library at these url's:

I think I'm going to put a parallel switch up on the dash  and switch it in
when I'm climbing steep hills.  That rich mixture might come in handy then.

Have fun
