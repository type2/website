Subject: driveaway tent for sale

    Header says it all, due to recent personal changes I have a drive-away 
tent for sale.
Tent is in excellent shape, no mold, no rips, no stains, the only thing 
keeping it from being perfect is lack of correct bag. $475.00 would prefer 
someone local, i.e. it's really too big to ship. I'm in SoCal
