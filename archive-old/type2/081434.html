Subject: [T2] Re: Moving the piston in disk brake


&gt; Don't bother with the bleeder bolt - I wedge the caliper piston back by
&gt; prying between the rotor disk and the piston.  I cut a piece of 2x4 into a
&gt; wedge shape (chop saw) so I can wedge it between the opposite piston/rotor
&gt; space, to prevent a possibility of warping the rotor disk.  Then wedge the
&gt; piston in with a &quot;pickle fork&quot; or tie rod separator or a small pry bar
&gt; levered against the rotor with a piece of leather or such to prevent
&gt; scratching the disk.  I think I've done it with another piecer of 2x4
&gt; thinned at the end to get in there and wedge back the piston.  You need
&gt; about a foot or more of leverage.  Make sure you didn't just top up the
&gt; fluid resorvoir, or it will go above the vent hole and soak the
surrounding
&gt; body.
&gt; &gt;&gt;I can't get the &quot;I
&gt; &gt; don't know what it is called&quot; to compress.  Does anyone have any
&gt; &gt; suggestions as to what I can do to get this job done Thanks for your
&gt; &gt; time.
