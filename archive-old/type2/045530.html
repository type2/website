I personally practice the &quot;make it sing&quot; method of revving through my gears.

The engine in the Mothership seems to like to reach that level of rev that
actually makes a certain whir.  Sort of like the same sound you hear when a
porsche engine winds out.

Hmmm....since the type 4 engine and the older porsche engines are very
similar, why not consuilt what they recomend on the rev thing.
