Hello Hello,
Well I am continuing to have problems with my new bus.  Nothing big just a few
small things.  For one, I can't get that dang oil drip to stop.  It still
looks like it is coming from between the valve cover and the head.  I replaced
the valve cover gasket yesterday, but it continues to drip.   Could it be
something else?  I would like to get it fixed so I could stop having smoke
come out of the defrost vents.

Also,  I am trying to time the bus but I don't know what to time it to. It is
a 79 that  was converted to a weber carb.  By the way, on the timing
scale...what is BTCD and AFTDC .  Is BTCD to the left of the zero or the
right.  Just wondering.  Trying not to drive to much until I get the
overheating problem done.
Hunter
