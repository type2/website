Subject: Return of pancake tuning

I compression tested my 2.0 yesterday and got a range of 110-160 lbs.  Does
that 110 indicate a burned valve?  I still haven't tried a new coil. I put
in a new condenser and the spark is  a little better, and let some light
into both of the carbs (no rebuild kit), but it still smokes and doesn't
like to idle. Meanwhile, there are a bunch of connectors on the carbs with
no wires on them.  If engine removal is required, how long can I expect to
spend getting the motor and tranny out as a unit?  My best time on an
upright type II was 45 mins, but I've never done a pancake before, and need
to block out my time.  If I'm gonna do major engine work, I might as well
get it out of the rain.  Thanks
Russell (starting to get really wet here in WA)
