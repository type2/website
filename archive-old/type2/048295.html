&gt; &gt; Yes, GR17X is for the 69-71 bus and is longer. it takes the concave backing
&gt; &gt; plate
&gt; &gt; to properly install it so that the fan belt runs in the correct plane with
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; crank pulley.
&gt; 
&gt; AND it takes a special cast iron generator pulley, they tend to break and
&gt; are unavialable new. Without the proper pulley and backing plate the
&gt; generator is next to useless... make sure you have all 3 parts before
&gt; attempting to install this combo.

Y'know, I have this generator in my '71.  Yes, it has the dished backing
plate.  However, it has a normal-looking stamped pulley, which, AFAIK, is 
stock. I also put a bus
generator in my wife's bug, with the correct backing plate and her
original bug pulley.  In both cases, the alignment has been just fine and
I've had no belt problems.
