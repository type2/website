&gt; perfectly. Now for the sliding door. I need to take
&gt; the guard off. I see the two screws at either end, but
&gt; after that how is it attatched? Won't seem to come

it is pulled out slightly at the bottom to clear the screw tabs then push
it up, there is a slot along the top edge it fits into.  might need some
encouragement to break the rust bond

&gt; loose. Do I need to remove it to put the slide block
&gt; back in?

never tried it that way might  work but the cover is so easy to remove
make life easy for yourself
