Subject: Re: Window glass

&gt; In the 65 I have ?louvered? windows. 

you should have 5 louvered windows and one stationary window 
if it is a gennie 65' westy

I think that's what they're called, the
&gt; one's on the side with the crank. Anyway, the glass in 
those windows have slits
&gt; along the edge for some reason and there is moss that has 
grown in there, so I'm
&gt; wondering what the best way to get the moss out.

i dunno?? a stick, an exacto knife?? prolly the best thing 
would be to replace the glass (two pieces laminated togeher 
that eventually become unlaminated again :(  ), it really 
depends on how much it bothers you :)..

 Also there's a couple that are
&gt; broken and need replacing, does anyone know where to get 
these?
