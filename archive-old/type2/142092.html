Subject: RE: [T2] wanted: watercooled replacement engine for 1973 Bus

&gt; &lt;On a side note: a friend of mine
&gt; has his heart set on putting a diesel engine in his VW Thing. Also
&gt; interesting, Bay window buses powered by diesel engines were available
&gt; to the European market, but were never imported to the States.&gt;

Water cooled diesels in bay windows? Which decade? 

Thanks!
