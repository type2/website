The answer to both of your questions is yes.

However, I doubt they will cure a &quot;severe&quot; oil problem. I
could be wrong;&lt;)

&gt; Sorry for the repeat question.  A month or so ago, I asked if the
&gt; installation of valve stem seals on a 1776 was considered a good idea.  I
&gt; bought them as a shot in the dark to cure a severe oil usage problem on a
&gt; new rebuild that included a pair of expensive Berg heads.
&gt; 
&gt; My questons:
&gt; 1. Has anyone run an engine with valve stem seals for, say, several tens of
&gt; thousands of miles?
&gt; 2. Are these seals used on engines other than our air cooled ones?
