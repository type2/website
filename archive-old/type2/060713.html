Hi Stephen &amp; listies,

I just updated my web page http://www.type2_dot_com/rvanness/ , which now
includes a third article on the BN4.  This recent article might be helpful
to you, Stephen, if you're dealing with a diaphragm pump model.  Also, last
week I priced some New heater parts from Espar.  Information on these, part
numbers, and prices are included.  If any list member has parts available or
can respond with information to any of the appeals for parts in the database
on my page, please contact me and I'll post them for the benefit of all.
I'll be adding some more pictures to the gas heater articles sometime before
the weekend.
