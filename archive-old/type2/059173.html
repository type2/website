Hey Greg...

I just got a Dansk muffler from The Bus Depot which appeared to be intact
and correct.  Stamped made in Germany (for what it's worth), it took a bit
of fenagling to make it fit (new heat exchangers as well), but all seemed
fine.

You might consider sending it all back, getting your money back, and
getting the right setup (probably for less) from Ron S.

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Cheers,
