I am trying to figure out the best way to handle the cylinders for my 
propane portable stove.

The instructions say not to subject the cylinders to high 
temperatures or store in areas used for habitation.

Well, I looked at the alternatives, and they were not great either. 
The liquid fuel fired one can spill, at least I can perhaps secure this 
one in a cabinet or something where it will be safe.

I am refering to the 1lb Propane canisters.

Looks like the safest alternative to me.

Of course I would never use the stove in the camper, the problem is 
the transportation of the fuel in my westie.
