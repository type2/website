Be prepared to carry some huge batteries.  The little unit draws 300W,
which translates to 25 amps continuously.  A good alternator might be able
to keep up with this, but you'd be pushing it with the stock system.

The site says that the unit can &quot;run all night on 2x200ah batteries&quot;, but
those are some hefty units.  A 12V 200Ah battery weighs about 130 pounds
and is 20 inches long.
