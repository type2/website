&gt; Before you get all high and mighty and start judging others... consider the 
&gt; fact that your Volkswagen Bus is not only polluting the environment at a 
&gt; significantly higher amount than a typical SUV, but you more than likely also 
&gt; get worse or similar fuel economy to some of the most massive SUV's available 
&gt; on the road today.

80%
of the total pollution that any vehicle will produce is in its manufacture...
