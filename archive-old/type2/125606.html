Subject: Re: [T2] FIRE! Almost. I'm screwed, need help BADLY!

Yeah, ok. Once again, as usual, I panicked before actually getting my hands dirty. The &quot;wiring harness&quot; is actually just a single big wire going to the starter. But to my credit, it IS a REALLY big wire, and it's wraped in the same plastic as a REALL harness is. And I found out what was wrong. It was wired to the wrong place on the starter. Back when I installed the starter (Remember way back then, I got the parts bus, and found the starter in the back seat) I plugged that wire into term 50 ( I think that's what it's called) and never had a problem with it. But that must have been becouse it was SOOOoooo dead. Now with the new one, their were some REALL issues. Just hope I didn't kill the new Alternator. I payed WAY too much for it at Napa. Like $130! But it has a lifetime warrenty. And since I'm 30 and plan on keeping the bus for my lifetime, I'm sure I'll be putting it to good use. :) The warrenty that is. 

Anyway, sorry for the hype, my bad. I overreacted.
