&gt; Old-timey aircraft had a fuel cap with a 2&quot; vertical tube coming out of
&gt; it.  A bent wire with a cork on the end extended up through the vertical
&gt; tube.  The cork floated on the fuel and the height of the bent end told
&gt; the fuel level.  When the bend in the wire got close to the tube it was
&gt; time to land.  The tube also served as the fuel vent.

&gt; The idea could be adapted to a bus, but it would get in the way of a lot
&gt; of luggage!
