Well, two other posters, both using pro installers, shared my tugging and
banging experience.  Point is, it can be a tricky job.  Looks like you were
a little luckier.  Perhaps the guy used more lube than I did.  I didn't want
to use too much lube and not get a good seal.  Bottom line is that I got it
in fine, and didn't break any glass.

I do like the idea of injecting some silicone under the outside lip.  This
sounds better than some kind a black tar goop under the whole seal.  And, I
don't have to take the window out again to accomplish this.

** all this talk about &quot;outside lips&quot;, &quot;lube&quot; and &quot;sliding it in&quot; reminds me
of something.  Just trying to think of what exactly it reminds me off.  Oh
well, I'm sure it will come to me sooner or later.

&gt;It takes a lot of tugging and banging

Um, sorry, but this may not be true. I watched
a windshield guy install one in my '71 Westy
while it sat in my drive way. He said the biggest
problem is when people fix rust on the metal sill.
Often times people build up bondo too high which
makes installation difficult. Once it resulted in a
broken windshield the customer had to pay for
because of sheet metal poor repairs.

I made sure my repairs were back to
the original plane of the sill, and watched
as the tech pulled the cord as he sealed it.
He was using some muscle on the cord but no
banging at all. When he was done he ran
a bead of silicon around the outside inner
lip of the seal. Good to go and no leaks.

For what its worth, when I pulled my windshield
out, I used a brand new cold chisel. I simply
&quot;shaved&quot; off the seal on the Front. Chisels are
~real~ sharp when new and are beefy enough
to handle the hard rubber. Then it was a
simple matter of lifting it off. I know everyone
says its a 2 person job but I found it pretty easy
if you wear gloves and are careful. And, since I
live alone it narrowed my choices a little.
