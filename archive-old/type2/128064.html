Subject: Re: [T2] Keyes

When I bought my bus, I was handed a box of random parts. Within this
box was another set of door handles. &quot;Whatever&quot;, I thought. A year
later, I needed to make my bus a daily-driver that I parked downtown.
The door locks on the bus didn't work for the keys that I had (I was
given extra keys too, but I have yet to figure out what they go to).
While rummaging through that parts box for a cooling tin screw I found
those door handles. Wouldn't ya know, the ignition key fit the lock.
After looking over the handles I noticed that they were a little more
worn than the ones on the bus. I figured the DPO removed the original
handles and popped some other ones on there without thinking about how
to lock them.
Long story short: I think my '72 had one key for everything. PO's
complicate things.

&gt; Did buses come with one key for igniton and all locks? Or were there 
&gt; two keys -- one for ignition, the other for locks?
