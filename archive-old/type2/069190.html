Subject: westy sink/frig cabinet for sale

A friend has given me a westy (presumeably) cabinet with frig, sink, water
tank, and apparently all hardware to sell for him as he is netless. I don't
own a westy, so please forgive my ignorance. I don't know what year it came
from, but the cabinet is covered in a simulated woodgrain and the
&quot;flip-top&quot; that covers the sink is in a light woodgrain with a hint of
green. There's some led lights on the front of the cabinet too.

Please email any inquiries to me.

Thanks!

tony
