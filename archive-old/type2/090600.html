Subject: 914 exhaust system questions What system would be best???

Hello List,

I am in a delema. I am trying to decide what type of
exhaust system to put on my 2.0 914 motor. The motor
came with its stock headers with heat shields. It did
not come with a muffler. This is the type that has the
triangular flange. I do have a set of trapazoid
flanged headers that came from a 1.7L 411. These will
fit fine but the diameter of the pipes is smaller
making them more restrictive. I also have a stock
72-74 muffler with trapizoid flanges and a good
bugpack exhaust system with trapazoid flanges. So what
should I do? Would the trapazoid flanged exhaust
systems be too restrictive for this 914? Would it be
feasable to buy a triangular flanged exhaust system to
fit its stock headers? I don't want to rob this engine
of its power but I don't know what type of system
would be best. Any help would be appreciated. Your
replys to my other questions have helped alot!!!
Thanks!!!!

David Kelly
