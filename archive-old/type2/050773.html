Subject: [T2] RE: Mercedes bus that looks like a vw??

I know a guy in Chicago that has a collection of these.  There is even one
that looks alot like the 21 window.  He also has a camper version.

They are based on the Mercedes disel pannel van.  The engine is in the
front.  I have never seen one on the rode or running, but I know this guy
has at least 4 of them.
