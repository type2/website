The first car I ever drove was a '71 Bug that Dad bought.

I've been driving a '71 Ghia for several years, and we 
recently bought a '71 camper van.  

All three share many features, including the hazard light
knob; it's red, with a &quot;VW&quot; logo in the middle, and all
three had a little &quot;88&quot; on the knob.

What's the 88 mean? 

Anyone?
