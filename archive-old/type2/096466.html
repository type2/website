Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Oil Cooler

I believe in the wisdom of St. Hoover. The stock cooling system is
adequate for enignes up to 2L UNLESS you want to run in extreme ambient
temperatures, or at high RPM for long stretches.

Being a freeway flyer myself, I fall into the or section of that sage
advice. I added an external oil cooler to my '77 Riviera and have been
very pleased with the results. I can do long hauls at 70-75 with ambient
temps in the 90's and still keep oil temps in the 220s. Now, I also run a
CHT gauge, and slow down if heads go to the high side of the 350 mark.
(Which has only happened twice hauling large loads over the grapevine and
shasta.)

However, if I was going to take the bus for some serious off roading I
would take the cooler off. (And the rear sway bar, since that just kills
the ground clearance!) Since this is not how I use my bus, I am happy with
the cooler and the plumbing under the bus, and the low hanging sway bar. 

I say keep it stock, make sure it is in tune, and the tin is in good 
shape. Drive slower (after all, you ARE off road) and you will be fine.

YMMV.
-Nick
