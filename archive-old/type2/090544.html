Subject: Re: [T2] Gauges - final 


&gt; Now then, the vendor guy says he does not think I will like the pod being 
&gt; mounted on my dash, so he suggested the upside down scheme.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe I should just order both pods, left and right sided configuration 
&gt; mount, so as to be able to make up my own mind upon receipt, and then 
&gt; return the one I decide to not use.
&gt; 
&gt; What you think ??

My bus has a pod mounted under the dash, to the right of the driver.
I have moved it forward and angled it up but it is still very difficult
to see. I am in the process of desigining an above the visor guage pod
which I hope will work out well for me -- I should be able to mount 6 or 7
gauges there. If this were not possible I would move the gauges from below
the dash to on the dash to the left of the driver. Your mileage may vary,
but I really don't like them down below the dash. I don't want to have
to move my head to see the guages.
