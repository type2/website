I'm adjusting my valses on my '72 Riviera for the first time and have a
question.  I got cylinder 1 to TDC and both valves were tight, no gap at
all.  I adjusted it to 0.006 and moved the engine to cylinder 2 TDC.  While
adjusting them, I noticed that the one of the valves for cylnder 1 was open
and so I checked it with my feeler guage.  The gap was bigger than it was
when I had the cylnder at TDC.  Moving the engine back to cylnder 1 at TDC I
checked the gap again and it was 0.006, so I looked at the valves of #2 and
one of them was open farther than 0.006.

So, I'm assuming that's normal, but wanted to check with the list to be
sure.

TIA,

Landon
