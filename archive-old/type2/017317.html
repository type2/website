&gt; Hey Everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; I am new to the list and this is my first post.  Recently my '78 Bus has
&gt; need some TLC, which I have tried to administer with my limited
&gt; mechanical knowledge.
&gt; 
&gt; Recently I had a problem with the alternator light coming on and then
&gt; the engine immediately dying.  I could restart the engine and the
&gt; problem only occurred when I was slowing down and almost stopped.
&gt; 
&gt; I tried first replacing the alternator belt, which seemed to temporarily
&gt; alleviate the problem.  Next, I cleaned the battery terminals and cables
&gt; and that seemed to temporarily stop the problem.
&gt; 
&gt; This morning, however, the light came on and the engine died a few times
&gt; while I was driving in a residential neighborhood with lots of starts
&gt; and stops.
&gt; 
&gt; The battery seems to be charging okay and the car starts fine, so I am
&gt; not sure if it is an alternator problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas?
&gt; 
&gt; I much appreciate the help,
&gt;

Arvid:
I'd crawl underneath and check that all the wires hooked to the solenoid
are okay. I had similar problems with a 73 once and it turned out to be
a corroded-off lug on the wire that takes the main battery power from
the solenoid to the main harness. I could just be a loose nut there too.
When working on this terminal either disconnect the ground cable from
the battery (chassis end of the cable is easier), or be real careful as
your wrench is hot in relation to the surrounding metal and will readily
start welding anything it touches.
Another good thing to check is the condition of the connections of the
transmission to chassis ground strap near the front mount. 
With the rain the Pacific Northwest is having these seem like even more
likely trouble spots. (Yes, it made national news!)
