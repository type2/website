Subject: Re: [T2] RE: GEX

Except for the 'stainless' part of the description, it sounds like a hydraulic
lifter pushrod from a 78 and up engine.



&gt; The 76 bus I'm resurecting,  the engine,I found out last week, is a
&gt; GEX...seems to run good with good pressure, etc. ...but in replacing the
&gt; pushrod tube seals, #3 exhaust pushrod was something I'd never seen...a tube
&gt; that was solid stainless steal, about 1/4&quot; in diameter???
&gt; (no, it wasn't a hydrolic lifter tube)...the rest of the tubes were the
&gt; standard alum/steel tubes.  I replaced it with a regular tube...no, the PO
&gt; did not do this, he said it was a &quot;new engine&quot;...so, GEX did it.
