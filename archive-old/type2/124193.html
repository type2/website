Subject: Re: [T2] Slider Cover(s) Removal

Kevin asked:
 Was wondering if somebody could let me know how the covers that are
 underneath the 2 rear windows of a 71 Westy come off the vehicle?
On one side its the cover that the side door slider is under.

 I took the screws out and tapped it from underneath with a rubber mallot but
 they wont budge.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 71 also has a nut on a stud at the end where the sliding door is.
Did you remove it also?   Most of the time, the stud it is on turns also.... uses a 8mm wrench
or socket.
Get a foot long 1&quot; x 4&quot; piece of wood. Go under the cover all the way to the top. Use a mallet or hammer to
tap the cover off the lip strip it sits in.
