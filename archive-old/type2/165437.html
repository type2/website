I believe that a '68 beam will bolt into your splittie, then you could use
the spindles from a '71 to support disk brakes.  IIRC, it will ride a bit
high in the front, making lowering spindles a good idea to level things
out.

You might be better off simply getting a wide-5 disk brake conversion for
your splittie beam.
