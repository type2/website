Subject: Re: [T2] Window workings

According to bus-boys:
211-837-571  Window Lift Channel, New  NLA

Ken, over at theBusCo has one for $10. He's got a regulator too ($20),
if that ends up part of the problem. BusDepot has a new lift channel
for $6 and they have the seal too (for $8.69!). They have the LH
regulator for $19.35 and RH for $20.98.

To be fair, Bus-boys do have a seal though (831-837-565  Seal, Window
Lift Channel to Glass  $3.14). If your luck is anything like mine,
Ken's lift channel won't have a servicable seal, and he deals
exclusively in used parts, so he won't be able to supply you with one.

Its not often I actually get to answer a question on this list. I hope
this helped.

ps: the '79 interior install is going well. The kitchen unit, the
closet and the fridge are secured. The interior panels on the LH-side
are in. All that's left are the headbanger and the z-bed, then its
finishing out the electrical. Should be ready for carpet by the end of
the weekend.
BTW, on the electrical there's this thick green wire coming out of the
metal box that has a big connector on it. I don't have the schematic
for the wiring, so can anyone tell me: does that wire go to ground?
Anyone know why they routed the water pump to the fuesbox in the front
of the bus unstead of into the alternate battery? I thought that was
odd, unless the fridge sucks all the amps available. Anyway... happy
motoring--

Window would not roll up.
 
the small rectangular metal part that held the glass in place had
rusted and separated from the works that would normally lift and close
the window.

If you want the world to be just,
put your feet to the dust.
