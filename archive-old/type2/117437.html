&gt; &gt; the flaps are critical for the proper cooling of the type IV engine...less

&gt; I hope I understood Jasan to be referring to the little aluminum flaps at the bottom of each end of the fan
&gt; housing where the heater boxes mate to the housing. Not the main air flaps up top. He did not say he removed
&gt; the housing.

those flaps shouldn't be a PITA to put in,,,, but the opening still needs
to be blocked off if they aren't put in or connected to the heat
system.  they cannot remain open as you will loose too much cooling air,
(path of least resistance)
