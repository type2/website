Subject: TYPE 2=Truck?????

I am curious to know if the type 2  was marketed as a &quot;truck&quot; or as &quot;car&quot; when
introduced to the US market. I know that the panels would be a truck right?
All this talk of how dangerous they are in frontal impacts has led me to put
mine up for sale, and I am looking for a good Geo metro (or Pontiac firefly
for you Canadians) to keep me safe.

Is there any good sources of vintage ads?


:)

Thanks

Eric
