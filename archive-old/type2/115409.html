Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Distributor score

Seth, do you mean the three near where the shaft meets the body of the

&gt;Is there a different hold down for the stock dizzy on a 69 than the 009 
&gt;takes?
&gt;When I put the stock dizzy in it seems there is these little nubs that 
&gt;protrude
&gt;from the bottom of the housing that prevent the dizzy from seating all the 
&gt;way
&gt;in.
