Subject: Full flow filter on 1600

--Bill,

sorry, not an answer, but I'm interested as well.

there is a full flow filter attached to the AE engine in my new-to-me '65 bus which I understand is a &quot;bolt on to the fuel pump&quot; design.

can anyone enlighten me to the pros/cons of the system or direct me to a link?

thanks,

billy

&gt;The case is in the shop being worked on and I am &gt;considering having it drilled and tapped to &gt;accomodate a full flow oil system.
