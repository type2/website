Subject: 15 and 14 inch tires

all this talk about tires... the bus we bought and is still on jackstands 
(this week back on the road!  ;-])  now i realize has 15's in the rear, 14's 
in the front. 69 upright poptop.
some PO did this, but... what about front tire alignment now? P215/75R15 vs 
P205/75R14. 
thanks!
