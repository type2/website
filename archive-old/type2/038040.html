Subject: Just bought a '80 Vanagon (long)

    This may be a &quot;Friday post&quot;.  You have my apologies if it's inappropriate 
or a bit long...

    I just escaped from the Sport Futility trap by trading in my old 4x4 on a 
'80 Vanagon last week!  I probably paid too much, and likely have some 
mechanical surprises ahead of me.  In spite of this, I've still got the silly 
grin from when I drove off the lot with my *very own* 1980 Vanagon Westy.  
    Why did I choose this quirky old underpowered camper van?  Part of it was 
for the memories.  My father had a '71 Karmann Ghia when I was still small 
enough to nap in the luggage space, and I still love that air-cooled flat-4 
music.  I haven't heard it for over 2 decades, and now it's back.  Quieter, 
and a bit off-key through the smog stuff, but still familiar.  It even smells 
right (I'll get that oil leak onto the exhaust fixed, eventually...)  
    Years later I found the meaning of &quot;Fahrvergnügen&quot; in a van-based VW 
pickup during a trip to Italy -- it's engine was probably water-cooled, but 
at the time I wasn't paying too much attention -- it was a blast to drive.  
The single-cab was in remarkably good condition, and despite being a dozen 
years old still ran well, shifted cleanly, rode smoothly, and didn't rattle 
or squeak.  But, I returned to a place where I actually needed that SUV I've 
just disposed of, and life went on.
    Eventually, I moved back to civilization and warmer weather, and became 
increasingly dissatisfied with the old truck.  If I was driving something big 
and awkward, I reasoned, at least it should be useful -- and it had been 
years since I needed four-wheel-drive.  I wanted a camper, but couldn't 
justify buying something that would sit in the garage most of the time.  I 
needed something with some amenities, some personality, but which was still 
practical. 
    That's when I noticed this blue van at a nearby dealer, with the top 
raised.  I'd completely forgotten about the Westfalia conversions.  I looked 
it over, in a state of glee I'd only seen before in a teenage girl 
test-driving a New Beetle.  (The poor dear didn't know any better -- I don't 
think she'd ever seen an Original Recipe Bug.  But I digress...)  I marveled 
at the efficiency and craftsmanship of the conversion, and it's state of 
preservation.  The Vanagon had about 75,000 miles on it (and a fairly honest 
odometer), all the appliances worked, and the canvas was in good shape.  And, 
it was almost entirely rust-free!  (Here in northern Utah, that qualifies as 
a miracle of the highest order.)  To top it off, the engine was air-cooled!  
And I thought all Vanagons were water-cooled....  It even had more power than 
I expected from that old engine.  Of course, I wasn't expecting much to begin 
with! 
    This was the first camper I'd seen that is actually useable as a daily 
driver.  (I didn't want to wreck a classic Bus with our road salt here.)  My 
Westy gets decent gas mileage for a minivan, handles very well even with 
manual steering, and I can park it in ordinary parking spaces.  And, when I 
want to go camping, it's already set up to go.  I can even afford it!  This 
one had it all: luxurious accommodations, character (not as much character as 
a Bus, to be sure), and practicality.
    So there you have it.  It's my own personal escape vehicle, ready for a 
drive down memory lane -- or anywhere else in North America, for that matter, 
after a bit of tinkering.  I think I'll be smiling about it for a long time.
