Subject: Potential Later Model Caliper on a '71... Problem?
Message-ID: &lt;3701A5D1.2A4B_at_super-highway_dot_net&gt;

Hi all,

I'm fairly new to the list and the bus scene.  I purchased
remanufactured calipers for my '71 westy from MOFOCO.  I did one side
one weekend (would have done both but had problems) and the other this
past weekend.  The pads in the caliper were not as snug as they were on
the first side.  The butterfly spring was not even in too tight.  After
extensive bleeding (did I have to bleed the back as well?), the system
brakes but I need to pump once or twice for more powerful braking. 
Should I get that &quot;larger&quot; caliper off and have one of the old cores
rebuilt, or is it a &quot;simple?&quot; adjustment on the brake servo, as
mentioned in the Muir book?  Suggestions?
