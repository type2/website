Faithful listees,
I finally have to break down and try to find a worthy new owner for
Butterscotch. She's a basic loaf with nothing fancy except a gas heater that
I installed a few years ago. She's mostly been sitting but starts right up.
Inside consists of front vinyl covered seats and one Z-bed. Ready for her
fix-up. Other than a banged in left rear quarter panel and various dings
body is solid. White and Mustard. Pictures available upon request. Like to
get $1000 but will entertain offer. This list is my first attempt, next I'll
try Samba, Craig's list, the likely suspects. Local to Denver.
Thanks for your help and interest. Call at 303-929-5232.
Joel
