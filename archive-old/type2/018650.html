Subject: About those front 3-point retractable seat belts from Cal. Imports in B.C. Canada. . .
Message-ID: &lt;3772E4E3.51E0_at_worldnet.att_dot_net&gt;

Just got the belts from California imports . . . 

And I have some questions.

Mounting the things in the original holes can be done, but the action of
the belt is not really nice and free, it is impaired somewhat.  Plus you
need extra washers and LONGER bolts to mount them so they won't be
interfered with.

Upon consulting with California Imports we find that the retractor is
supposed to be mounted down in the door side seat base (hip-butt area)
and then the belt runs up to the upper B pillar (where a loop is bolted)
then across the seat diagonally to the latch in the middle (where they
normally latch) and then the end is bolted in the same hole as the
retractor is bolted.  To make the B pillar mount work with out being
interfered with you need several washers and a longer bolt and the same
with the lower seat area mount.  We were told we would have to be
&quot;Creative!&quot;


For those of you who may have experience with these things:
Question 1:  What about bolting  the retractor to the &quot;bulkhead&quot;
(that    wall behind the front seats) and then having the belt run up to
the    upper B pillar mount and down diagonal-cross-seatback to the
latch    and thence across the seat-seat to the door side seat area
(hip-but    area)?  If we mount it there the action is very nice but we
are    worried about the thickness of the wall's metal there--it is
much    thinner than where the bolts are placed in the upper B pillar or
down    in the door side seat area (hip-butt). 

   We are concerned about the thin-ness of the metal there; it is   
extremely thin compared to the B pillar mount hole and the door side   
seat base.  I don't want to put it in there unless it would  be safe   
in an accident.  

   What do you think?

Question 2:  Any advice on where/how else to mount these puppies in a
crash safe fashion, that will allow the things to work correctly?

Question 3:  How &quot;creative can we get and still be safe?

We are leaving on our trip saturday, and all SPEEDY replies would be
greatly appreciated, or I guess we will just end up usin' our old belts.

Thanks to you all,

Lauria Watts
