Subject: Voltage Regulator? cont.

I was able to get the warm air fan running by disconnecting the 
voltage regulator all together. Now I get a solid 12V through the + 
side of the fan relay(A) to drive the contacts down providing 12V for 
the fan. The question is: Is my voltage regulator bad? Is there any 
way of checking it with a multimeter? I ohms checked each blade 
connector in the regulator to the outside case and they all had 
continuity. I am putting this bus back together and the engine is not 
in running order so any help would be appreciated.
