Subject: Door lock problem.

This weekend I tried to tackle my drivers door lock, with little success.
(So far, it's been one of those little things I've just lived with.)

The problem is that I cannot unlock the drivers door from the outside.
(I have to climb in from the passenger side.)  

However, if the door is open, the key will flip the little lever (this is a
1970 bus)
from open to locked and back again - perfectly and easily.

Shut the door again, and it won't work !   (It's just possible to lock it,
but unlocking 
is definitely no-go.  I don't want to break the key off !!!)

Is there some adjustment I can make ?
