No more red heater knobs?
  Maybe you could buy the blue ones and the get a can of
spray on plasticoat.. Sold as a tool handle rubber coating,
you can buy it in a liquid can and dip your tool handles or
in a spray can. Comes in red and black and??... I have
found the stuff is pretty bulletproof so far and I think
the red matches the original knob color pretty well. Stuff
goes on in light coats and shows any ridges or holes left
in the
surface being treated. Cures to a semi flat finish.

    Just a thought.......
