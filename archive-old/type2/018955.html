Subject: Stiff louvered window crank
Message-ID: &lt;38061843.88A90BE9_at_crosslink_dot_net&gt;

One of my louvered windows opens/closes smoothly while the other one is
pretty stiff.  I looked at it and don't see any obvious way to lube it.
Is there a way to get some lube in there and what kind of lubrication
would be preferable? Thanks.
