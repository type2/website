I think those springs go into the ends of the throttle linkage bar that
attaches to each carb.  The same bar that your throttle cable attaches to.

&gt; Help,
&gt;
&gt; I have a pair of Weber 34-ICT carbs for my 1800.  I am looking for more
&gt; information on these carbs so that I can reinstall them.

&gt; Specifically, there are a pair of springs which have me mystified.  I
&gt; have no idea where they go, though I am sure that they belong on the
&gt; carbs.  They have no hooks on the end, so I am assuming that they go
&gt; inside of something. They are about 3/4 to 1 inch long and 1/4 inch in
&gt; diamteter.
&gt;
&gt; I did not rebuild the carbs, so I am sure that the springs had to be
&gt; removed in order to remove carbs from the engine.
