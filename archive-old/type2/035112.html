Subject: bus trailer hitch

I am looking for a trailer hitch for my 73 Westy.  Anyone on the list
have one for sale or know where I can get one?  I would prefer one that
is a VW accessory but will consider others.
I need one to tow my 69 Beetle Convertible to shows this season.
Thanks in advance,
Al
