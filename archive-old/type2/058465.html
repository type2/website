Subject: turn signals don't work!

Hey All,

I have a somewhat baffling problem and was hoping someone could help.

My turn signals on my '69 Westy stopped working 3 days ago and I'm not
sure why. I inspeced all the fuses and they're fine. While checking
the fuses, I noticed a wire had come loose under the dash. It was
black and red and comes from the turn signal unit, but I can't see
where it terminates. I plugged it back in and still nothing.

Could it be the flasher unit? If so, wouldn't the turn signal bulb
still light up but simply not flash?

I really hope it isn't the turn signal switch itself, as it's a very
spendy piece, not to mention a pain to change all the wires out. I've
changed it twice already with new German units and they are CRAP!!
Both broke in a matter of weeks.


Thanks,

Jaime
