Subject: Help Door Non-Opening Vent Installation

Hi,

I need some advice on how to install the non-opening vent on the front doors.
I started the task of replacing the front windows rubber (inside and 
outside scrapers,
felt channels, 1/4 light seals) and I ran into trouble while trying to put 
it back together.
I spent 4 hours today trying to figure it out.  Any help would be much 
appreciated.

Thanks,


Rogelio
