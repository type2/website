Subject: Re: [T2] Parts List to fix Troy's broken bus.....

Hi Volks,

I have a pair of trustworthy jack stands I will bring. I also have a bottle
jack; but a nice dolly jack would make it a lot easier.

The flywheel wrench is probably just a locking clamp to stop the flywheel
from turning as you try to get its bolts loose.

Vice grips and duct tape: NEVER leave home without them.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; I'll have my torque wrenches there. (not the nice clicky ones but the
&gt; old fashion pendulum type) &amp; what trip in a bus would be complete w/o
&gt; vice-grips :)
&gt; 
&gt; I hate to add, but does anyone have opinions on if troy should also
&gt; get a throwout bearing?

&gt;&gt; Ok,
&gt;&gt; Here is the list of parts that I plan to buy from Joe at
&gt;&gt; BustedBus and have shipped tomorrow.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Engine seal (Flywheel and Crank seal)
&gt;&gt; Transmission shaft seal
&gt;&gt; Clutch disk
&gt;&gt; Flywheel washer
&gt;&gt; Wrench for flywheel (Cant remember name, Joe said its special tool that
&gt;&gt; costs only few bucks.)
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; This list alone will be pushing my budget.  From what I have
&gt;&gt; gathered, it seems I will need a small sledge hammer, torque wrench, and
&gt;&gt; some vice-grips.  Sorry to say I do not have these three.  Think I will
&gt;&gt; be able to scavenge these at EB?  I will be bringing basically all the
&gt;&gt; tools I have.  That should cover the common stuff such as sockets,
&gt;&gt; screwdrivers, pliers, etc.  I also have only one bottle jack rated at 6
&gt;&gt; tons and the stock jack that came with the bus.  I was also unable to
&gt;&gt; find a place to get a seal remover in short time.  So, anything missing
&gt;&gt; that I should add?  Oh, I would be willing to donate my engine to see
&gt;&gt; who is faster at pulling the engine or engine/tranny.  :-)
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Thanks again everyone.
