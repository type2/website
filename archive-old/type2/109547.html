Subject: EGR question

Hello all

I was just curious about something with my EGR unit. It is currently pinched
off and sealed just on the under side of the tin since the PO replaced the
stock exhaust system with an extractor system. I do not plan to replace the
filter untill I need a new muffler. The EGR is the mechanical type and the rod
that connects to the throttle body is still there and functions as it should
when the throttle is moved. What I'm wondering is if I should remove that rod
for now untill I replace the EGR filter at a later time? Does it contribute
good, bad or not at all to the way the bus runs since there is nothing hooked
up to the exhaust?

Thanks
