&gt;We are rebuilding a 2.0l for our 72 bus, we plan on travelling alot and

&gt;are also using dual dellorto36mm. thanks

I've had both for many years and I prefer the hydraulics.  Less maintenence 
is good - gives you more time to enjoy driving your bus.

As for cam, I am going with the WebCam 107i:

I have heard good things about WebCam from engine builders on this list.  I 
also have Dellorto DRLA's, btw (40's).

Be careful towing that trailer.  Get lots of gauges and monitor them 
closely.  I can't count the number of times I've heard, &quot;I used to have a 
bus, but it died while we were towing a small trailer cross-country&quot;.
