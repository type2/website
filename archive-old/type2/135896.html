&lt;&lt; I could dig it, just think about the possibilities. You could frame in
a window in the back and get an actual household swamp cooler. If you
made it just a little taller, you could probably fit a real stand up
shower in it. You could throw a wood burning stove in it and rent it
out as a small apartment during the winter.

Why do I feel that if this VW had a TV, the only show it would
get would be Jerry Springer... ;-)
