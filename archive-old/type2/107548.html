&gt; Hi!  I recently rejoined the list after the purchase of a 78 westy. &gt;
&gt; Questions?
&gt;
&gt; 1. how is the best way to remove the pilot bearing outer casing?  That is
all
&gt; that is left.  I read the archives and it talks about a. pilot bearing
puller,
&gt; b, paper towel soaked in oil, and c) grease and a smack of the hammer with
a
&gt; socket properly sized for the opening...  So any recommendations?

Well, the *easiest* way to remove it is to use the tool for the job, which
is an inside puller.  I believe many FLAPS will lend you one for free, or
you can rent one at the local tool rental place.  It's about a 1 minute jog.
I guess those other ways might also work, depending on cicumstances, but I
haven't tried them.

&gt; I have the
&gt; flywheel off.  Is there a bearing in the flywheel?  I see a small case
where
&gt; the pilot bearing passes through....

No, the pilot bearing lives in the end of the crankshaft.  No bearing in the
flywheel itself.

&gt; 4. how tough is it to replace the pilot shaft seal in the tyranny?  while
I
&gt; can see it....

The hardest part for me was getting it out since it's kind of hard to get
to.  I used a seal puller and basically destroyed the seal out.  Getting the
new one back in place is easy.

&gt;  3. Anything else I should do while IO have the engine out?  clutch looks
&gt; good, I will be replacing all fuel lines, cleaning and painting the tin,
&gt; replacing air/intake main\fold hoses, front and rear main seals, por 15
the
&gt; battery box areas, sealing up everything I can to provide a good cooling
&gt; system.  What else?

FI seals, large O ring and felt washer for the flywheel, check out the
thermostat and flaps function.
