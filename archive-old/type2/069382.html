Subject: Need jalousie rubber '65-'67

If anyone has any nice (non dried to the bone and shrunken) grey rubber body
to window seals for a set of '65-'67 jalousie windows &lt; 5x &gt; please contact
me off list at either this email or at vanbondo_at_primenet_dot_com.

I got the windows all detailed and looking beyond wonderful but the grey
rubber stuff is dried to the bone and cracked. Several local attempts to
locate similar new rubber have fallen short of the mark. Any help will be
appreciated.
