&lt;&lt; Rick,

All of the T2's I have ever seen had them, unless someone forgot to put
them back on.  My 78 has one.

Are we talkin' about the front &quot;belly pan&quot; that covers the mechanicals
(pedals, shift, etc.), or the full pan running back to the engine? The
front pan is universal; the full pan is not.
