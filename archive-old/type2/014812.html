BTW, Oregon is the same way. Its all mini-serve. You can be fined $500 for
pumping it yourself, however I have never heard of it happening.

I live in NJ, and pump my own gas in the 78 Westy- my reason is that the
stupid vapor recovery system has this spring loaded accordion tube
around the filler pipe, and if the attendant tries to jam it in our gas
filler holes, it can crack the rear of the stiff and old rubber
rightangled entry pipe (ask me how I know)- also, the way it hangs there
when they leave it can wreck the rubber right behind the screw holes. 
When the attendent comes, I explain it's an old bus not designed for
modern unleaded/vapor recovery fillers, and the filler must be held at a
certain angle and the accordion pulled back by hand, or you may get gas
all over- ie you must hold it during the entire fill.  They readily let
me do it then!
*Quoth Steve Lashley: &quot;I stopped for gas in New Jersey and the attendant
overfilled the tank causing gas to run into the engine compartment for
20 minutes. ....I learned my lesson to never ever get gas again in New
Jersey, where there is  no self serve.&quot;
