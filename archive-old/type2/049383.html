Subject: [T2] HEATERS - Ceramic, Gas, and Stock

     In my on going quest to kep my 76 bus warm for the winter months I have 
been wondering what step I should take next.  Right now I'm waivering 
between the cigarette lighter/ceramic heater vs. a gasoline heater available 
in a local wrecking yard.  I am also having trouble getting the stock system 
in top shape.

My questions are as follows:

1.  What sense would there be in getting the ceramic heater.  How noisy, 
expensive, effective, would it actually be vs. my other options.  I know I 
don't see a lot of discussion about them on the list, I was just wondering 
if there was a reason for this.

2.  I unfortunately don't know the exact model number for the gas heater I 
have available.  I do know it came from a late model bus.  What would be a 
reasonable price for a used heater given that all of the ducts, switches and 
parts were available AND it worked properly?

3.  I hear repeated success stories from the gas heater users and don't 
doub't their ability to make a vw warm.  My question however is pertaining 
to whatever disadvantages they might have.  Is there any chance of carbon 
monoxide poisoning?  What precautions would be taken to avoid this and how 
reliable are they?  Also how do they compare to the electric heaters in 
terms of both power draw and niose?  Is the installation procedure worth the 
amount of work necassary?

4.  My stock system is just that... stock, however there is one problem that 
has been hampering its abilities.  The heater cable that operates the valve 
to turn on the defroster/front vent/rear vent slips in and out of the small 
hole that connects it to the valve underneath the vehicle (approxmitaly 
underneath the bench seat).  Cosequently it fails to go completely open or 
closed so there is a weakened amount of air going to the defroster or visa 
versa. If there is any advice anyone could provide on trying to get the 
cable to stay firmly attached to the valve I would appreciate it.

5.  Obviously I am open to other suggestions as well.  If you have any ideas 
that havn't been posted in recent threads please let me know.
