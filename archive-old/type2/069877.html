Reaching back into the recesses of my mind [believe I, it's not always
pretty in there ;)] to my days growing up around marine diesels,
doesn't it just make more sense to filter the fuel before the pump?
We always had a fuel filter either attached directly to the tank or
mounted on a bulkhead of the engine room [in the case of aft tanks
that were hard to access].  Mind you, there's no carb on a diesel, but
the principle is still the same...you want to remove the crud before
it gets into the fuel pump not after.

When I bought Ras Bulli Split, the PO had installed an inline fuel
filter between the pump and the carb.  I figured he just did it
because the rubber line was easier to cut than the steel.  I then
promptly removed it and round filed it, replaced the fuel line and
installed a canister fuel filter on the fan housing in the line
between the tank and the fuel pump.

[Of course, I also plan to install an in-line oil filter when the
engine overhaul comes due ;)].

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Splits...Oh, my!
