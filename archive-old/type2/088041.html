     Well, we got the first offer back for the bus.  They want to give =
us $3800 for the bus.  Not done the stuff in the bus.  Seems a little =
low to me.  Especially compared to the prices I have seen for other late =
model bay campers.  Not sure about this.  I got about 8 different camper =
prices &amp; faxed it to them.  Now we wait some more.  God, I hate this =
kind of stuff.  Thanks for letting vent.
