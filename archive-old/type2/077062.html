Subject: Re: [T2] Newbie

Let me add my zwei pfennig...

When I buy a new bus, I expect I will have &quot;a year in hell.&quot;  That is, I
expect that during the next year, I will have to take pretty much
everything apart, clean it, lube it, remove corrosion from it, etc. etc.
At the end of that year,  I usually have a pretty sweet running bus for
many thousands of miles, with no major breakdowns, or at least none I
can't handle.  The reason for this year is that we have inherited buses
that are old, and that usually have not had the periodic maintainace that
they ought to have had.  No one flushed the brake system, grease was a
rare luxury, the trans has 140K miles and its original fluid, etc.

So you step back and read all the periodic procedures and plan on doing
each of them real soon, as you cannot presume any have been done within
living memory.  You plan on having the fuse box off and matching it to the
wiring diagram, removing the remains of half a dozen DPO-supplied radio
and CB hookups.  You plan on new brakes... pads, flex hoses, and maybe
drums, discs, and some of the metal lines.  Plan on at least regreasing
all the wheel bearings.  Expect passenger tires, which  will need
replacement, no matter how new.  Bet on new ball joints, tie rods, and
drag link, and be happily surprised if they  are not needed.

These are all the sorts of thing that need to be done on a scheduled
basis.  They can be postponed, tho, and you can bet they have been.  So
now you have to do them.  And, as I tell anyone who admires my bus.... YOU
have to do them!  For two reasons.  First, if you do it and you screw up,
you can do it again.  You know what went into it and you probably have an
excellent idea of what went wrong.  Second, if you decide to pay someone
to do it, it will eat you alive.  I know of no shop that changes less than
$60/hr labor and VW's are very labor intensive.  The parts are cheap, but
they take hours to install.  If you pay someone to do it, it will run into
hundreds of dollars.  If you do it, it will be dozens of dollars!

*AFTER* the &quot;year in hell&quot;, I have driven buses across the US and back
every other year for the last 20 years (OK, a couple of my vacations I
took in Europe :-).  Make it 7-8 trips.  Average miles traveled is ~7-8
thousand.  I expect I will break down once per trip, but that the
breakdown will not be catastrophic. It will also be something that I
didn't attend to before I left :-(  The only time I had major troubles on
a trip, it was with a bus I bought 6 months before the trip.  I had not
gotten all the way thru the year nor thru the check list and I regretted
it.

A fresh bus will be a joy to drive and will give many thousands of miles
of trouble-free service.  The problem is that if you just bought it,
unless you bought it from a restoration shop with an advertisement (and
guarantee) as having had a &quot;total restoration&quot;, it is probably nothing
like a fresh bus.

Someone on this list, a long time ago said that a bus costs $5,000.  You
can pay it up front or in repairs, but that is what a bus costs.  My
experience has been that that person (I wish I could give credit) was
entirely right.  I prefer to pay it in repairs, as I am very good at doing
the mechanicals.  I look for buses with dead engines and have not ever
bought a bus that ran.  My take is that if the engine does not run, then I
*know* its condition... it is dead!  If the engien runs, then I have to
listen and smile as the owner describes a beast he does not really know,
then pay for an engine of which I am profoundly dubious.  If, on the other
hand I buy a bus with a dead engine, then I buy a new engine first thing
and I know and have a guarantee of the engine condition :-)
