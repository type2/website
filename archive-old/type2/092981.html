Subject: Re: [T2] Possible fuel injector problem??

I still vote for compression - the symptoms match perfectly.  The valve 
lash on #4 could be nearly nonexistant (i.e. tight valve) and when the 
motor warms up one of the valves (probably exhaust) may not be closing 
completely causing compression loss only when warm.  I recently saw the 
same thing on Nikki's bus in fact.  Idled great until it warmed up, then 
started to miss.  Did you do the compression test when the engine was cold, 
or warm?

If you did a warm compression test and it passed, then it has to be either 
a clogged injector or an electrical problem of some sort.

&gt;Spark ok.
&gt;Compression ok.
&gt;I clearly have a fuel delivery issue, but only to
&gt;cylinder 4. When I pulled the cable for cylinder 4
&gt;when cold, the rpms drop a slight bit, but when the
&gt;engine is hot, there is absolutely no change.
