Subject: Re: [T2] Westy front Cot

could someone send me a picture of what the ends of the bars look like.
if i can't find them (cheap, anyway) my dad is a wiz with fabricating
things, and if i have measurements and a photo, i am sure he could make a
set for me (and possibly anyone else who wants some).
