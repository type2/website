Subject: got it running sweet, Thanks

I got it running OK tonight after much fiddling, 900 rpm idle with 7.5
deg BTDC ignition.

Reved it up to 2200 rpm and she showed me about 36 degree BTDC reading,
is this correct? Obviously vacuum advance is working. Dwell holding at
49 to 50.

I think Al directed me once to use the higher rev and BTDC reading to
set the engine. I did notice slight misfires at higher revs around 2200
to 2400 RPM on my dinky little meter, yet when I pulled the meter out,
it seemed better. Some how I wonder if the impedence shunting of the
meter or the load on the coil primary does not start to matter to the
points at that frequency or that pulse width. 

After all, it is a pretty dirty pulse switching those plugs.

Cheers,


Alan
