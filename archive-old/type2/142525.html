&gt;I set the timing to 7.5 BTDC on my 1974 bus and pulled
&gt;the vacume hose of the flat part of the distrubiutor

&gt;idle.

Your vacuum can sounds broken.

&gt;I also noticed that the hose does have a
&gt;considerable amount of suction when i put my finger
&gt;over it.  How do i check the disributor vacume system?

You need a vacuum pump and timing light and vacuum gauge.
 
With the engine running, block the advance port on your carbs/TB. Connect the gauge and pump up the can. Increase the vacuum level to 12&quot; or so and watch the gauge. If the vacuum level doesn't hold then the can is broken.

You can check the advance with a timing light as you pump (slightly harder to coordinate if the can leaks).

&gt;Also does anyone know where to find a clear vacume
&gt;hose diagram for 1974 bus.

&gt;Also I have a new 0 231 178 009 distributor with an
&gt;electronic iginition in it instead of points.  Will
&gt;this work with the 1974 bus?  A friend gave it to me
&gt;one day.

Yes. Not ideal but the bus will run fairly well.
