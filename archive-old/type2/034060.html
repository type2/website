Subject: Re: jumpering a fuse

While it's been lotsa years since I earned my paychecks working on cars
(there's easier way of making money) the expertise and skill level involved
is still my means of earning a living today.

Nowadays I work on low and high voltage control circuits and I can tell you
that bypassing, jumpering or anything else it's called is standard
diagnostic practice whether it's on a car or on a machine of ANY kind. The
technique is applied with knowledge, experience and logic. There's no need
to be afraid if you know what you're doing.

Testing,  proving what's good and what's bad, following the process of
elimination ......so it goes on and on. Anybody that has ever hot wired
anything to see if it works has jumpered. Ever bench tested a starter with a
set of jumper cables or start a car with a set of jumper cables ?

If it makes you feel better put an inline fuse into your jumper wire but to
refuse to use a jumper wire as a way to test a circuit or component is
limiting the ability to diagnose to just short of useless.

In my opinion.
