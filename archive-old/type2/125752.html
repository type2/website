Subject: Re: [T2] Heating questions

Those are the people who likely shouldn't drive at all.

&gt; 
&gt; Why of COURSE it does... The engine runs hotter, doesn't run as good, heater doesn't work anyhow, it was in the way, PO took it apart and forgot how to reassemble it, and 101 other reasons that basically just points out that many POs are idiots that ought to be driving a Chevy rather than a VW. &lt;grin!&gt;
