Subject: ASSEMBLING 1800 ENGINE

Hello everyone,

I am assembling my 1800 and just want to check a few things.
When re-assembling the connecting rods does it matter
which side numbers face upwards.i matched the numbers
on the rods to the caps but on one side there is three numbers
and on the other side 1 number. does it matter which of these sides faces
up? also, i see in the haynes that the oil seal is installed after the
halves are together, just want to confirm this.
and the hub is installed after the halves are together.

thanks for your help,
Darren
