Subject: check those fuel lines!

Hi. Yesterday I decided it was time to change the oil, clean the air
filter, and adjust the timing. While at FLVWAPS (Off-Road Warehouse), I saw
a pile of fuel filters. I bought one to go with the oil filter gaskets, as
I had not changed the fuel filter yet (I've had the bus for 4 months).
Everything went well until it was time to change the fuel filter. For some
reason, the PO mounted it above the tranny. I was ready with my pencil to
block the fuel line from the gas tank. I pulled out the old fuel filer,
inserted the pencil, and the tube cracked lengthwise for about an inch. As
the fuel poured all over me, I tried to pinch off the tube, and it broke
off in my hands. I said, &quot;Ack!&quot; Luckily, I was finally able to get the
pencil inserted after only about a pint of gas poured onto me. While this
was happening, my 4-year-old daughter, to add to the excitement, starts
berating me about how I had not gotten her lunch (unbeknownst to me, my
wife got her lunch about an hour before). When I told her to please remove
herself from this potentially dangerous situation, she, as all other good
four-year-olds will do, started screaming. I must say that, at that point,
self-immolation seemed a reasonable option. To make a long story short, I
cleaned up, got 8 feet of fuel line (the good stuff with cloth on the
outside), and replaced all my fuel lines. I had about 2 feet left over, for
those who want want to know. My understanding is that these lines don't
need clamps, but I put them at the fuel tank and the carburetor just to be
safe. The counter guy at ORW suggested that I change my fuel lines every
other year, as most VWs that burn up do so because of cracked fuel lines
(IHHO). Is this an appropriate interval for changing fuel lines, or should
I do it more often? I guess I am really lucky that the gas got all over me,
rather than over a hot manifold while cruising around town.

I set the timing statically. I know that engines don't run statically, but
a strobe light isn't in the budget right now. The PO had it set to about 15
degrees BTC (AH-series 1600 w/stock vacumn advance distibutor). I reset it
to TDC, which is the recommendation of my 1975 edition of Muir. I adjusted
the carburetor idle air screw according to Muir (34-PICT-3) by screwing it
in until it slowed down, then out until it was running its fastest, then
1/2 turn more. I also adjusted the idle screw so it idles at 875RPM or so.
It runs great! I guess I'm a little worried however that these adjustments
will be judged as inappropriate (too lean, too rich, etc). Am I on the
right track?

Next weekend I hope to adjust the valves and check the spark plugs. I hoped
to do it after changing the fuel filter, but that slowed me down a little.

Take it easy,
