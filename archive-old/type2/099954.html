&lt;&lt; Hello All   Lets not get carried away, BMW did exactly what VW did on the 
trademark about 8 years ago. Also did they produce the number of vehicles 
that VW did? Is there as large of a following?  I don't think so. We can only 
hope VW wises up but I won't hold my breath. Later and have fun  Mark Dearing

350,000 world wide for BMW...4 million for VW last year...
Both Ford and VW are snapping at BMW's heels; the Rover
takeover was way overpriced and so far has only produced
the nouveau Mini (35,000 so far). The 90's boom has left
most manufacturers with excess capacity and not enough
market to split so many ways. The final four or five will
probably end up being &quot;platform&quot; manufacturers with models
spun off or &quot;badge engineered&quot; (Opel/Catera, etc.) to suit
marketing whims...
Remember the shake out of the British auto industry? Lots
of Marques survived the war but gradually ground down to a 
precious few and then winked out...
