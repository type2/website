Matthew, a memory comes of someone being pissed off about this and drilling
out the spotwelds holding that bit in (they are at the end I think, its
raining here) and replacing them with self tapping screws. Bingo! Just like
the other one, you take it out when you want. Worth checking.

&gt; Hello fellow listees!
&gt; I have a question. Some buses have a removable body piece behind
&gt; the bumper
&gt; that is removed to help facilitate the removal of the engine.
&gt; Mine doesn't
&gt; have this. I was thinking about cutting out the same place in my bus, and
&gt; replacing it with a piece of metal that can be bolted into place.
&gt; Has anyone
&gt; done this? Does it sound reasonable?
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Matthew Santori
&gt; 78 Westy 'Blue'
