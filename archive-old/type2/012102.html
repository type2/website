&gt; My other thoughts are:  
&gt; 
&gt; 	a) something associated with the positioning of the crank due
&gt; 		to the additional shims  (i think i saw a bad bearing
&gt; 		listed as the cause of someone's troubles in a related issue)

&lt;snip&gt;


&gt; So I guess my first step is to back out to an intermediate shim and try to get
&gt; my endplay closer to 0.05 and see if that sorts me out for the time being.  

this did it.  not sure what the endplay is now, but I just kept going
down in shims until i could turn the crank.  Hopefully this is still in the right
endplay range.

happy friday volks...
