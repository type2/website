Hi Volks,

Mapquest is telling me that Death Valley is an 8 hour drive from  
Tempe, AZ. The Grand Canyon is several hours away; too far to reach  
in an evening. Much as I would like to experience both of these  
places, it isn't likely to be practical in the time I have available.  
My employer is paying me to be able to learn at the courses they're  
sending me to, so I can't wear myself out every night driving off  
into the desert. (Once, maybe....)

Now stop talking about these places, it's driving me crazy.... So  
close, and not enough time....


Happy trails,

Greg Potts
