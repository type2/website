Subject: getting the valve covers on was Re: [T2] making valve cover
  gaskets  stick to valve covers

Just in case any of you are struggling trying to get your valve-cover
on/off, I have the *perfect* tool that makes it a BREEEEEZE.  

It's your typical drum-brake pliers with the goofy little bend on the
end.  To get the bale down, just sit in front of the cover, put the
pliers on the bale, lean back and pull down.  To put the cover back on,
just grab the bale with the pliers and &quot;walk it up&quot; the cover using the
tip of the pliers as a lever.  takes about 5 seconds to get it back on
(one-handed), and you can use the other hand to make sure the cover
doesn't move.

btw, weatherstrip cement works well to hold the gasket on.  However, if
they still leak, replace the bales and that should hopefully fix the
prob.  using the above method will keep the cover from moving during
install so you might be able to do away with any sealant..

&gt; list,
&gt; what is the best product to use when glueing the valve cover gaskets to
&gt; valve covers.  despite taking all of the necassary precautions and
&gt; having decent covers mine seem to leak more often than i care to admit.
&gt;  so please enlighten me.
