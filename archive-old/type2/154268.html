ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [EPA-R09-OAR-2005-AZ-0009;
FRL-8284-2] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; Arizona;
Motor Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance Programs AGENCY: Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. 

 

SUMMARY: EPA is approving two revisions to the Arizona State Implementation
Plan submitted by the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality. These
revisions consist of: changes to Arizona's Basic and Enhanced Vehicle
Emissions Inspection Programs to exempt collectible vehicles in the Phoenix
metropolitan area, and collectible vehicles and motorcycles in the Tucson
metropolitan area, from emissions testing requirements; an updated
performance standard evaluation for the vehicle emissions inspection program
in the Phoenix area; and new contingency measures. 

 

EPA is approving these two state implementation plan revisions because they
meet all applicable requirements of the Clean Air Act and EPA's regulations
and because the exemptions will not interfere with attainment or maintenance
of the national ambient air quality standards in the two affected areas. EPA
is finalizing this action under the Clean Air Act obligation to take action
on State submittals of revisions to state implementation plans. The intended
effect is to exempt these vehicle categories from the emissions testing
requirements of the State's vehicle emissions inspection programs as
approved for the Phoenix and Tucson areas but also to provide a mechanism to
reinstate the requirements in the event of a violation of the carbon
monoxide national ambient air quality standard in the Phoenix or Tucson
area. 

 

DATES: Effective Date: This rule is effective on April 30, 2007.
