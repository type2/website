An excellent posting, Rick. I'd also make sure that the battery 
terminals on the auxiliary battery are clean and that there are no other 
resistances in the charging circuit. You can take your rig into most 
battery houses and have them tested for cold crank power. This will tell 
you if the battery is weak, or just not properly charged.

You might also check that fridge. If it's low on freon, it will 
run continuously and can drain a good battery in a short period of time. 
You can also add a power converter to allow you to plug into AC, if you 
often camp at &quot;improved&quot; sites.
