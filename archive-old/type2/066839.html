I won't touch the Freudian implications of that one...

My VW dreams tend to stem from deep seated anxieties about unsolvable
mechanical problems.  Sorta like the &quot;showing up to the final exam without
studying dreams,&quot; I dream the engine has bizarre added components that I
don't know the function of and that aren't in the manual.  If I do discover
how the bizarre part works, it changes form and I have to start figuring it
out all over again.  To make matters worse, the bus itself will often morph
into another make/model--like it will start off as a bus and then turn into
a Nash Metropolitan or it might share characteristics of both.  Sometimes
major components (like the transmission) will be missing and I'll fret over
it, but I'll still be able to drive the bus, searching for the lost
transmission that I must've dropped back down the road.

The more I think about it, I wouldn't mind if buses stayed out of my
subconscious!
