Subject: Re: Best way to support transmission??

Dropped my 71 bus engine plenty, 24 yrs ago (trying to find leak, a crack
in block!) with a board, 2 scissors jacks, 3 pieces of broom handle about 2
feet long, a sledge hammer, and as I recall,  some pieces of 2x6 (4) to
drive the bus rear wheels up onto.  This was to make it easier to get under
the vehicle.   I also used a concrete block with a board on it to take the
weight of the trans.   For the latter you can also use the chain idea to
keep it pulled up, using those screw links.   One thing I liked about the
&quot;free swinging&quot; trans is that after removing the engine carrier, I would
lower the engine with the trans until trans was on the board.
I managed with both hands to control 2 scissors jacks standing on the board
with the broom sticks below!    The engine lowering is not far enough to
put strain on the cv.s, just enough to make the engine PARALLEL to the
ground ()because rear wheels were driven up on pairs of 2x6's)and make it
easy to reach behind the fan housing to get at the upper bolts.  This way
the engine pulls right out or goes in without dealing with the problems of
an engine (on the jacks) not being parallel to the trans.
The board and rollers allowed easy yanking and especially reinstallation,
where all I had to do was lie on my side, watching the trans shaft and tap
on the board with the sledges to align the shaft to the clutch release
plate.  Piece of cake compared to my current 78!!!
