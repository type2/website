&gt; Also,  what is the best type of cleaner to use on the fiberglass.  

I recently cleaned the fiberglass luggage rack with first dishsoap 
solution, then Collinite's No. 920 fiberglass boat cleaner.  I had 
some lying about from our O'Day Daysailer, so I figured what the 
heck.  It claims to leave the fiberglass surface &quot;chemically clean&quot; 
and did leave a nice smooth finish.  It soon hazed up a bit as it 
dried, at which time I used a boat wax to restore the luster.

Worked for me...YMMV.
