Subject: California! Buses! Vacation!

Hey volks!

Altho I'm not in my trusty VW (with the crippled tranny). I am in CA, and it 
is beautiful here!  I started in San Diego on Saturday (night) and am now in 
Dana Point.  Will be in Anaheim until Friday. 

I have seen more buses here than I can enumerate.  It's amazing!  There's a 
hightop Vanagon here in Dana Point that really caught my eye.

Just to let you guys know I'm here.  Any of you West Coasters going to High 
Country Bus Festival?

&quot;At least I'm enjoying the ride&quot;

PS  Great post Dave, (Digest #281) I wish I could have made it to Full Moon 
in Joon!
