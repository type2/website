&gt;[Crick, Bill ]
&gt;This shouldn't be too tough to do without an engine
&gt;- Iff your goal is to study the electrical outputs
&gt;which is the width of the injector pulses, cold start valve signal.
&gt;This won't alow you to diagnose air handling issues
&gt;with the system when it is in the vehicle such as vaccuum leaks, aux
&gt;air reg...

Preston and I set up his FI ('83) on a bench before we transplanted it into
his 72.  You're right - you can't find vacuum problems. Our setup included:
- Spare Dizzy and coil. We spun the dizzy by hand to trigger the injectors.
- All FI components including fuel pump and gasoline (be careful)

We were able to test:
- All injectors and spray patterns.
- Cold start valve - spaying and verify that it does not leak.
- Double relay
- Thermo time switch
- Brain (basic functionality)
- Fuel pump

With this setup we could have (but didn't) test fuel pressure (regulator),
AFM (other than the fact that the injectors fired), Aux air, temp sensors
(other than room temp static resitance).

Personally, I think the bench setup is a great way to test a FI before it
goes into a vehicle (such as a transplant or a re-installation). It's much
easier on the back.

Status and review of FI transplant ('83 to '72) :
- She fired right up following the transplant
- A few vacuum leak fixes later and she ran like a champ
- After warm weather arrived vapor lock appeared and the gasoline return
line had to be run back to the tank rather than just back to a 'T' by the
fuel pump. (The fuel rail needs a constant supply of cool gas from the
tank).
- After installing the Tiger 581 CDI is was discovered that the '83 brain
needs the high voltage flyback provided by the stock coil/points setup (this
is the signal the brain uses to fire the injectors).
