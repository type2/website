Subject: Exhaust air leaks...?

My bus is acting up again....  

First, some info:
  My bus is a '77 fi.

Second, the symptoms:
  The bus starts up fine, but when I try to rev the engine for the first 
time, the rmps drop to almost nothing as soon as I press the accelerator 
- - it comes very close to tying.  Once it's warm, this problem goes away.

  I know that the muffler leaks - I'll be replacing it soon.  However, 
there's some more air moving under the engine, and I'm not clear on what 
that means.  I think I may have exhaust getting out from the exhaust 
manifolds, and maybe the heater boxes, and the U tube going from the 
manifold to the heater boxes.  I hate to replace all of that ($$$!), so 
I'll be looking closer soon.

  When I look at the engine from the driver's side rear tire at night, I 
can see blue every time the engine goes over, so I think the manifold or 
u tube leak is fairly big....


Third, an Idea:
  Is the hesitation related to all that air I'm feeling down there, or 
could it be something else?  If it's all leaks, why does it go away when 
the van is warm?  Is there any way I can check the vaccum advance?  That 
seems like a suspect since the problem comes up when I press the 
accelerator...


Fourth, a question:
  Has anyone else priced exhaust components recently?  The price seems to 
vary hugely.  I think I'll probably end up going with a muffler from JC 
Whitney (woe is me) that replaces the cross-over and a few other 
pieces...  I haven't seen any exhaust manifolds for sale anywhere - junk 
yard!


Thanks in advance!
Ben
