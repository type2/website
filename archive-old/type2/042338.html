Subject: 1971 Westy For Sale

1971 VW Westfalia Hardtop, 177,000 miles, 1600 DP rebuilt 12,000 mile ago, 
brand new clutch and throwout bearing, new starter, electronic ignition, 
alternator conversion and battery, brand new Carburetor, new brakes, master 
cylinder, and front calipers. It has new Shocks all the way around, New 
carpet, the interior is in fair shape, the seats are in good shape, it has 
all of the closets and storage spaces, it has the mosquito screen and child's 
cot, the only thing missing is the sink/ice box combo unit. The body is in 
okay shape with a couple small dents here and there and a little rust in the 
lower rocker panels. It probably could use a paint job too. It runs great and 
is an everyday driver. I have driven it all over Oregon and Washington 
without any problems. It just needs a home where someone has more time to 
give it the TLC it needs. It is located in Portland, Oregon.
Asking $1,500.00

Thanks
