&gt; Who told you?  I've been running very fine on normal 87 octane.  All I've
&gt; ever used is 87 octane.  And if I use higher octane (which I've done a
&gt; coupla times for comparison) I find no difference in performance or
&gt; mileage.  So I see no reason to use high octane gas.  Dissent?

Better milage is one good test... and also listen for pinging.

As an engine accumulates more miles and/or gets out of tune, often a 
higher octane is needed.
