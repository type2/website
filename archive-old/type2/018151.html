I just happened to have my '76 Westy completely stripped when I came across Matthew's page.  I
have duplicated his work on my bus, including Kool Patch, Space insulation from JC Whitney,
etc.  I did deviate in a couple of respects, however.

Up here in the frozen North, they lay an underlayment called Ice Guard under the first several
rows of shingles on a roof to prevent ice backing up from the gutter and ripping up the
roofing.  You normally find it with the mineral grit on it for safety but they also make it
without.  I found a roll at one of the Home Depot type stores; $56 for a roll 36 inches by 60
feet.  It is a heavy, rubbery material with a self-adhesive backing that, while not quite as
effective as Q-pads, certainly comes close.

Another thing I did slightly different was to go into the gas tank compartment and completly
insulate this area as well; Kool Patch, Ice Guard and Space insulation.  This really seems to
isolate the motor compartment from the interior space.

By the way, I tryed another cold patching roofing cement and it was a mess.  Kool Patch was
only $5/gal when I finally found it at Lowe's and it dries in an hour.  I did the entire
interior, motor compartment and the cooling passageways between the rear vents and the battery
areas in two coats and it looks bombproof.

I have to put the new AVP motor in this week and will be reinstalling the interior over the
next two weeks, so the proof of this Ice Guard material will be in the near future.  I'll keep
you posted....
