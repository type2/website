Subject: [T2] Washer bottle

A collegue in the veterinary field has a dental unit that uses compressed
water to flush the teeth as they are cleaned. The reservior bottle has
sprung a leak and when she called the company, they reported that the bottle
used is from a late 60s bug! They report the bottle is NLA. Any ideas other
that a junk yard where we can find one? She does not want a used bottle for
fear of chemical residue. Would a bus bottle work if a new one can be found?
Any pack rats out there have one in their stash?
