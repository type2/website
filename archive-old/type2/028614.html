This is serious beacuse that booster costs nearly $200. Save it
if you can before it dies. You will know that it is dead when
every time you step on the brake your engine loses vacuum and
stalls.

&gt;I have a 72 bus and on the dash next to the heater controls is a little
&gt;yellow light that has a B on it.  Just yesterday for the first time it
&gt;came on.   What does this mean?

In case you haven't got the message already, it means there is a problem
with
your brake system.  In 68-73 buses the &quot;B&quot; light is not connected to the
parking brake in any way.  If it comes on, you either have so little fluid
in
your reservoir that you're sucking air into your master cylinder or some
portion of your brake system has failed.  Either way, you need to inspect
the
system and bleed it.

On 68-73 buses, you could press the light to test it.  Starting in 74, the
light was no longer testable in this fashion and it also became used in
conjunction with a manual switch located on the plate by the hand brake to
tell
you your hand brake was not completely released.

On a side-note, if you're loosing brake fluid regularly and can't figure out
where it is going, it's probably leaking from your master cylinder into your
brake booster.  That's bad because the fluid is corrosive and will
eventually
ruin your booster.  If that's the case, you'll need to rebuild/replace your
MC
and remove your booster to poor the fluid out of it.
