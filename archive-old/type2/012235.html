X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

&lt;I didn't have the cash to do all at
once so I had the ball joints replaced,
 and the right tie rod end. From
there, they aligned the van as best they could.&gt;

It will never be fully &amp; completely aligned until
everything that needs replacing is replaced.

&lt;I don't know how replacing these things
changed it, but I'd like it straight again.&gt;

Your alignment is off.

&lt;My question is...should I wait
until I replace the steering box to
 straighten it?&gt;

That depends - are your tires showing signs of odd
wear patterns? How bad is the handling/steering?

&lt;And, will I need to get the van aligned
again after all of this other work.&gt;

YES!

&lt;The van does wander to the right a tad
now.&gt;

More evidence that it is currently out of
alignment!
