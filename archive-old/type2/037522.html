Subject: F.S. aircooled vng in PA

I have for sale a 1983 aircooled vangon. I am in southeastern PA that should 
be running by the end of the week. It has new heads on it from AVP as well as 
new plugs, wires, distributer cap, and other assorted tune up parts. Email me 
if you are interested.
Thanks,
Jeremy
