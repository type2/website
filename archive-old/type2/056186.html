&gt;The reason they went from the engine-compartment type heater
(BN4) to
&gt;the under-Bus heater (BA6) in '75 was because of the fuel
injection --
&gt;they ran out of room in the engine compartment I guess.  Not to
mention
&gt;that the BA6 is a much better heater.  I'd stick to that one.
&gt;Why do you want to move it?

I have a BN4 no BA6.
Thanks for the info.
here in NH it seems hard to find the gas heaters, that is why the
BA6 is missing.
