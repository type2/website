AFter posting my problem yesterday, H and Sean wrote back and told me to
check various things.  This is what happened:

I looked under the dash to see if I could see the connection.  I couldn't
figure it out, so I decided to go back to the engine compartment.  I tried
to turn the fan by hand, and it did move (unlike last week) although there
was some stickiness to it, but not much.  So I checked the in-line fuse and
it was blown- yay!  Replaced it (first dropping a fuse down into the depths
of the engine somewhere or another), went up to the front and turned on the
car, then the fan.  Boyfriend in back: &quot;Alrigh-!!!&quot; The fan turned for a
little bit right when I turned on the car, then stopped.  Checked the fuse
again- very blown.

These are our hypotheses:

The fan motor is frozen (Like H Steven said) but, not wholly so it turns,
but sticks and backs up and blows the fuse right away.  Need new motor.

Wiring problem?  There was lots of electrical tape around- but this is not
very likely.

Something else.

I already asked H Steven this, but does anyone know for sure if I could
possibly replace the fan motor with a non-VW motor?  Radio Shack sells all
kinds of motors- maybe I can find a 12 volt low RPM one?  And I don't know
for sure, but I think I could figure out how to somehow replace it, even if
the current motor is sort of part of the fan housing.  Ideas, flames,
comments appreciated.  Thanks!
