Subject: Re: [T2] avp engine...more

Folks, this is the first engine that I have purchased as a 
longblock *ever*(25+years).  So it will be interesting to see how it goes.

I just couldn't see that I would have time to rebuild the way I wanted and 
still make the show in Eureka springs in August.  The original engine will 
go on the bench till I can redbuild it like I want this winter.

Yes, the push rod tubes look kinda rough to me also....as well as the 
valve covers....the valve covers will get romoved and sand blast/powder 
coated so they look better.

Some of the tin under the push rods(pic #7) looks like it was pretty 
awfull before they painted it.

I gotta admit that I am impressed that they drilled an tapped the oil 
galley holes though, and that it looks generally pretty clean.

I will pop the valve covers and look and take pics there also so everyone
will know what it looks like.

One thing that is interesting is that t4 heads have valve guides showing 
on the intake side but not the exhaust side.  Look at the yellow guides on 
#4 as opposed to the &quot;bare&quot; valve stems in #7.  Interesting...something 
for me to think about and go look at some t1 heads some more.

What is also interesting is that it was shipped with oil in it...and it 
looks like they must have spun it up enough to get some oil pressure 
somewhere.  I don't know yet how much oil, but it definitely has some 
behind the red filler plug.

More in about 3 weeks whe it should be in and running...I may do a leak 
down test first, but not sure that it would mean anything at this point.

Cheers, dave
