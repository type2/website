&gt;Subject: brake booster.

&gt;Is there a way to test a break booster that is not on the bus?  Can I just
&gt;unhook the line from the booster that is on the bus and connect the line to
&gt;a second booster?

This might be possible, as long as you fill the big hole with a master cylinder.
This could conceivably showw the vacuum, but may not be conclusive.
This is one place where you can use RTV sealant. ( or a new o-ring ).

 If so, is there something I should look for or listen for
&gt;to tell if the second booster is good?

push in the mastercylinder piston and determine assistance from the booster.
do you have the check valve installed ? It will draw and hold vacuum, you can
blow through one end only. should be measurable vacuum.

&gt;  I'd hate to go through the trouble
&gt;of installing the second booster and then find out it is no good.

Why not ? Everybody else does !!!
