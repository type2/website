Subject: Did &quot;MrVolkswagen&quot; send you mail???

Hi all:

Today I received an email from a &quot;MrVolkswagen&quot; via a Hotmail account.  The
email, which had no body text, had 2 file attachments, a &quot;text&quot; (.txt) file
called ATT00022.txt and a &quot;batch&quot; (.bat) file called face.bat.  I deleted
the message unread since it could very well be spam, or worse.

Just thought I'd pass this along since somebody could be harvesting list
member addresses.
