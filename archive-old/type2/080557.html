Subject: Re: [T2] very frustrating electrical problem

Jeremy:

The fact that your battery reads just over 12volts is a bad sign.  It should read at least 12.6 volts if it's fully charged.  Does your dash charging light work?  Does it stay on or glow, even very faintly, when the engine is running?

? voltmeter on batt reads just over 12 and the elec system seems to 
&gt;be charging proper. is it the cold temp outside (35-45 degrees)? is the 
&gt;battery possibly faulty? what should i try?
&gt;Thanks for any advice!
