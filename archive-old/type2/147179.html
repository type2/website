Subject: Engine Code &quot;ED&quot;

My engine code is &quot;ED&quot;. This was the stock motor in my first bus, a '75. 
It came fuel injected (the older L-JETRONIC). Is this an 1800cc or a 2000?
When I got it, it had never been torn down, so assume it is completely 
stock.
I am finding conflicting information.

http://type2_dot_com/bartnik/enginecodes.htm states it is a 2000cc

bentley states it is an 1800cc

I can't remember where else I've seen it, but I know there are other 
places that call the &quot;ED&quot; code a 2000cc.
I always though it was an 1800cc. Can someone say for sure?

Eddie
