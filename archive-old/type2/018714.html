Hi ya Volks!

I'd like to share with my fellow Bus drivers on the Wood issue.

Many of you may have noted my sign off referring to &quot;Janis&quot;, '71
Westy/Campmobile/dave edition.  The dave edition refers to what I feel are
respectable personalized wooden accents.   I have replaced my instrument
panel with a burl walnut, and all panel surfaces will be a red mahogany stain
held in with brass phillips head screws.  It is my plan to re vainer all
interior Campmobile fixtures and surfaces with a tasteful wood.  The stick
shift rod is now a 25&quot; muskidine vine twisted sapling.  Put some 1940 wooden
radio knobs on the stereo.

Janis interior makeover is a long long way from completion but I love the
progress so far!

Wood when combined with the practical and special applications will always
enhance that &quot;Busma&quot; inspired karma that these wonderful machines have.

Through &quot;Busma&quot; her karma will blossom
