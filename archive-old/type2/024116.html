 You shouldn't have any problems installing the 6v flywheel and clutch as long as its 180mm and not 200mm. When I bought my bus 8 years ago i did convert to 12v but left the 6v starter.The extra torque really helps when the weather is cold.

&gt; I have the 66 that I'm gonna go start on this weekend.  First question is 
&gt; this.  I am going to use a later model motor a 1300 from a bug year 72.  I 
&gt; know this motor will bolt right in but the starter and flywheel are 6 volt.  
&gt; Will the 6 volt pressure plate and clutch kit mount up to the newer case?  I 
&gt; am still up in arms about keeping it 6 volt or converting so any feedback pro 
&gt; or con would be appreciated.  I need to get this bus on the road and then 
&gt; pass a German inspection so it will be a few months.  But it will be all 
&gt; worthwhile.  Also any more info on the sliding door would be appreciated.  
&gt; Not much info on parts or accessories that I've seen.
&gt; PEACE OUT
