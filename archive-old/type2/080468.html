Subject: RE: [T2] alternator bracket / steering coupler


&gt;
&gt;I've done the steering coupler with the box in, no fun, but it can be done.
&gt;Need to unbolt the steering column base from the floor. If I remember
&gt;correctly, getting the arm off the steering box wasn't happening and I
&gt;couldn't remove the steering box until that happened. Do I remember
&gt;correctly? In any case to remove the steering box you need to remove half
&gt;the bolts on the coupler.

I'm at this stage of my Westy restore and you can remove the steering 
column easily and do all the work from the top.

Unbolt the column from the dash and from under the windshield (remove the 
instruments it's easy to see - one 10MM bolt). Unplug the wiring from the 
column. Pull up the trim at the bottom of the column and unbolt the 
coupler. Discard and replace (mine was a cracked mess).

You might be able to do this job without removing the column - I did not 
try this route.

Chris in TN
