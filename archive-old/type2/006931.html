Subject: cylinder gasket to shim conversion and flywheel resurfacing
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hello,
Before I ask my question I just wanted to say thanks to everyone
that gave me suggestions on what are mystery part might be.
Everyone suggested that the metal bearing was probably from a pilot
bearing roller. I asked my neighbors son if he had and work done
on the pilot bearing and he told me some work had been done
recently. So it is unquestionable thats what it was from.

Here is my question:
We plan on eliminating the cylinder gasket and replacing it
with a cylinder shim. (79' 2000cc  engine)
We would like to know how to create a good sealing surface
between the cylinder and the head. I was told to use
valve grinding compound, but that is where I need help.
I dont know how to use the grinding compound.
Could a kind person outline the steps necessary to do this
change to eliminate the head gasket.

My next question is how would I go about resurfacing the
flywheel. We found some reference to using silicon carbide 
paper in the archive. Could some one clarify what grit and 
any certain direction to sand?

Thanks for anyone's help! all comments are welcomed and helpful
Steve,
