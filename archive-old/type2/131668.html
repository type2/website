Subject: Bus fight in court

Going to court today to fight Landlord. He wants to evict myself and family 
because of breach of contract. His wife doesn't like my &quot;disgusting hunk of 
junk&quot;. My lease states that no inopperable vehicles be parked outside. My 
camper doesn't fit into my garage, height restrictions. But I should fare 
well with a verbal agreement that he and I made that if it was not visible 
from the street. It's not and he has not told his wife about the agreement I 
am sure. Wish me luck.
