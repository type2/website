I know I just sent another message about my Fuel Injector problem but I am
stuck.  I can't seem to get the large bushing to hold my injector in in
combination with the retainer plate.  Does the bushing go partway through
the retainer plate so that it holds the injector. I think I see how its
supposed to go together but I can't squeeze that bushing in there to save
my life. Nothing in archives or in Muir,Bentley,Haynes.  Help Please
  
Thanks in advance
