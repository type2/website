Subject: [T2] thanks (running badly)

Thanks to all that responded a few weeks back on the subject of &quot;running badly&quot;.  Weather finally warmed up enough to work on 78 Westy and it turned out to be, that the points had closed up, and the wire to the #3 head temp sensor was loose on the connector.  All is fixed now and she is back on the road, actually running better than even......... although using a little more gas than I would like..... 
Again, thanks to all
