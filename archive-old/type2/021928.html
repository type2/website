I was talking to Nikki and she said she boiled an entire pot of water with
just the lp that was in the lines (the valve was turned of by accident).  I
imagine if you filled up the tank, it would last at least 20 hours or
constant use.  But then again, I am not an expert.  Just an uneducated
guess.

Hey listers,


&quot; The propane, only time will tell, though I suppose someone with more
inclination than I could calc out the average number of btus in a
gallon of propane and estimate it.  I suspect that Mike's estimate of
3-4 days is about right.&quot;

A gallon of propane has about 90,000 btus.  Just happen to know that 
tidbit......
