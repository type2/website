Subject: Re: [T2] 77 Automatic Transmission - Is it toast ?

Bob,

Appreciate the response.

Any idea where to get a good used one? I know of one
in a junk yard locally in kansas City, but the bell
housing had cracks around it (large ones), I doubt I'd
consider it a good used one.  I did manage to scavange
the torque converter off of it, but never thought to
complete pull it and what the differences are between
the &quot;final drive&quot; and transaxle, time to do some
bentley reading....

What about the pump being &quot;gone&quot;, possible to do
oneself ?

I'm not too keen on a 1,000 repair, but it's a small
price to pay to keep the bus on the road and
comparable to rebuilding other auto-tranny's; shipping
something this large is always a PIA.

If you can find the time to get me any names of these
places I'll try and track them down...

As always the list is most helpful, even for us bus
introverts that lurk...

Bob
