&gt;Im sorry to take things personaly, but I guess you dont know me. I am

&gt;a female rider, but no your dirty little mind was to busy formulating some
&gt;stupid sexist joke.) so dear 75112.2101, you can Kiss my tailpipe.  I simply
&gt;desire someone to split the cost of gas and chat with. Also to keep me from
&gt;driving ten hours without stopping (a bad habit of mine.) I thought that
&gt;someone who gets this lisrt might want/ need a ride to NY. Sorry that I like
&gt;to share my house with people who bathe. maybe this reqirement is to much for
&gt;you.

&gt;I thought the new VW motto was &quot;Drivers Wanted&quot; not &quot;Assholes wanted&quot;. If im
&gt;right you have the wrong car.

&gt;ps. I am not stupid enough to go looking for a date in a male dominated
&gt;medium (two actually, VWS and Nerdland). 

Who are you and what are you ranting about?  If you're this touchy and
humorless, I'd sooner hitchhike from Seattle to NY and take my chances with
a loony, psycho axe-murderer giving me a ride.  Andy's got the right car;
maybe you've got the wrong list.
