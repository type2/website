Subject: Auburn Hills Show-Installment #3-final okay, now i'll shut up :-) -for a while

Dear Folks,

Needless to say, Gus and I got home in fine shape and Eddy and I headed for
Chinese (if you come to visit us and Chinese food is your bag we'll go to
this place and have a banquet!!!) but before then Gus and I went to The
Show!

The morning of the Show itself dawned kind of dreary but we were sure that
the clouds would burn off, so having donned my &quot;meet-the-folks&quot; duds and Gus
having had a nice bath the previous day (that was an adventure all itself as
it turns out and one we won't repeat) we zoomed into the morning and up I-75
to Volkswagen of America Headquarters.

After getting my hand stamped with a really cute &quot;bug&quot; stamp (Gus was a
little miffed it wasn't a Bus-I told him that if they were stamping
something larger than my hand a bus would have been fine...) we went in to
set up. Oops got the wrong spot and tried again. By then it was John
Hartranft to the rescue! We set up the sunshade and the tables and started
to decorate the booth. We nixed the checkered flags (tacky is my middle
name) but okayed the international flag banner for the front and then set up
John's really nice, classy, attention-getting banner (photo of which is on
the web page at http://www.type2_dot_com/~chuff - click on the &quot;latest news
update&quot; bar just above the &quot;Great Bus Tour&quot; and scroll down to see the photo
of the booth). Gus was having a fit about doing the purple and green palm
tree thingy's, so to shut him up we hung them to the rear of the booth and
finally got the helium tank out for the balloons. Now that thing was the
real hit of the booth! Everyone got to play with it and there were lots and
lots of balloons distributed that day too. Steve Dolan showed up to help set
up and booth sit. So we were ready to greet the day!

John parked his bus right next to the booth just across the booth from Gus
and I've got some nice photos of the inside of his bus and some of the
others I'll put up on the Tour Page as soon as I can.

Another fun thing was that we were parked across from John Morris and his
newly painted splitty (a photo of whom is in the Tour Box) We had a fun time
visiting! John had a real adventure getting home (hope you caught his trip
report about the flame assisted 8-track-I'd like to put that up on the web
page in trip reports if it's okay with John).

We passed out the brochures and lots of people &quot;oohed and aahed&quot; over the
Tour Box Souvenirs (usually after asking &quot;how much for the neat patch or
sticker&quot;). We did a lot of promotion for the Type 2 and Vintage Bus lists
too so we hope lots of folks found out about the great resources there.

A photographer from the Detroit Free Press showed up to take a picture of
the Hubcap (I later found out that I had an e-mail from Sally Farhat of the
&quot;Freep&quot; expressing her interest in the Tour) so I hope we got some coverage
there. Jamie Rivers and John Hartrampft were the real heroes of the day
though, and got the news out to the Volkswagen of America folks who are
going to do a write up in their newsletter so maybe they will be interested
in housing the Tour Memorabilia when the Tour has finished it's wanderings

John handed off to Jamie after the really exciting Pass in Review and Jamie
explained about the Tour to the assembled crowd so we were well represented.

We also finally got to meet a bunch of fellow listees who all (we hope) got
purple balloons and generally had a great time. The Der Busbesitzer Gruppe
were there in force and it was such fun to meet you guys and gals!!! The
Canadian Contingent were there too, well represented and ready to rock and
roll-carabusing back with Jamie (ooohhh try to explain all this to American
and Canadian Customs.._dot_can't wait to hear about all that) The Wisconsinites
were there with Isaiah and Stella (Gus was really &quot;frosted&quot; with me that I
didn't introduce him to Stella-I heard about that all the way home-that and
not finding a Blaupunkt radio for his best Bus friend, Big Orange-Garey
Simpson's '76). So many sweet, neat folks I didn't have long enough to get
to talk to and get to know-okay, you're all invited South! You've got to
come visit so we'll really have time to chat! You have my e-mail-let me know
when you're headed this way and we'll do Gus and my favorite thing (besides
Bussing) and that is EAT! (Ask Chris Slaymaker about how we like to eat!)and
TALK!

The Show was a great success and I'd like to thank the Michigan Vintage
Volkswagen Club for having us and being so kind as to accommodate us by
letting us set up the booth-they are a really nice bunch of folks with some
great looking and great running cars!  And I would also like to thank
Volkswagen of America for their interest and look forward to communicating
with them about the Tour in the future.

Chris and Gus the &quot;When do we do it again?&quot; Bus
