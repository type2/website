It can be mounted anywhere you can saw a 4.5&quot; hole for the mounting 
plate and exhaust and combustion intake.  I have two batteries in my 
engine compartment, so that wasn't an option.

After playing with it for a day I'm glad I can't point the air flow 
directly at me.  It's way too hot.  The hot air tube is 2.5&quot;, so you 
could fit it in the main hot air tube under the bus easily.  It's really 
small and could go just about anywhere.  If I ever put one in Bessie my 
hardtop westfakia I'm going to install it all under the jumpseat.
