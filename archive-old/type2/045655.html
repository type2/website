There was a little nutty guy at the VW Auburn Hills show this past Spring 
that claimed to have a kit to convert a air cooled bus to water cooled using 
all original Mexican bus parts.  He even had a converted bus there to show 
off.  Price tag without installation?  $5,000.

The problem is that I'm convinced that this was a real Mexican bus and not a 
converted US model.  I didn't get a VIN number, but the engine compartment 
looked original with no sign of modifications or added brackets.  I also 
noted that the rear compartment access lid was more square and about the size 
of a Vanagon lid.  The lid on my '74 is smaller and rectangular.  The guy was 
strange, telling me he was headed for Alaska as he thought this is where his 
real customers will be given the fact that he can offer water cooled heating 
and it's really cold up there.

Anyone else meet this guy and know anything about this bus?
