hey monica,
I think your mini splittie is a model for the FALLER-Bahn.
Those were made in the mid '60s by the german Faller company,
not only as a race track, more to build normal road traffic with it.
They had normal roads, single roads, crossings and all the stuff
you need to build a little town (houses etc.).
In the later years they also had race tracks. The split was always the
loser.
They had many different models, beetles, mercedes, even a little
(mercedes?) truck with a trailor. I also have the split (grey/white), 
and a Mercedes 190SL, a 230SL a 220S and a Porsche 356 from that time, 
sold about 17 years ago by a local electronic shop new boxed
(no VW's) for under 1$ each - and the Idiot I am bought just a handfull 
of them. I nearly had forgotten  that black day...
They are sometimes available on auto jumbles over here. $20 for 
used ones...


Keep smiling,
Michael

&gt;I found one mini splittie with a lonely driver in my grandmother's
&gt;basement a few years ago.
&gt;Get this it at one time ran on a race track!!! 

&gt;I never did find the race track or any other cars....
