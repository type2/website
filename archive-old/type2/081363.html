&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &quot;The latest (june '02) Automobile magazine came yesterday, and on page
20,
&gt; &gt; there's a news release about the Supreme Court upholding a California
ban
&gt; on
&gt; &gt; brown sports cars. Now I'm old enough to not get bamboozled, but there's
&gt; no
&gt; &gt; disclaimer nor a hint of tongue in cheek-ness to this article. Anybody
&gt; know
&gt; &gt; anything about this? I'm not making this up, but it sure was
interesting.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Yes, it's true. In fact, if you try to enter the Sovereign State of
&gt; California in a brown sports car, the agriculture inspectors will seize it
&gt; along with your weevil-infested peaches. It is common knowledge that brown
&gt; sports cars are vectors of disease and filth, and we support are
governor's
&gt; efforts to eradicate brown sports cars, buy 100 million dollar software
that
&gt; the state agencies didn't know they need and support the kindly corporate
&gt; officers of Enron by accommodating their request for an extra 10 billion
&gt; dollars for gas and electricity.
