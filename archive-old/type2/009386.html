Jeff S. asks:

&gt;I am not clear on one thing, why would you feel like an idiot for obeying
&gt;the law? Who is making you feel like an idiot ...?

I am going to answer this on the list, and hope that it does not generate 
a thread.

There is a set of concepts in evolutionary biology -- prospect and refuge 
-- that bear on human nature. Folks are more comfortable when they can 
see without being seen. In American culture we have turned that around in 
some ways -- people want to be celebrities. To be seen without seeing.

If I am poking along at 25 mph while 300 to 400 cars per minute zip by at 
more than 50 mph, I stand out like a sore thumb. I am seen without 
seeing. I am a celebrity. And it makes me uncomfortable. The discomfort 
makes me wonder what I don't get that everybody else gets. I feel like an 
idiot. Doesn't mean I am an idiot. I just feel that way.
