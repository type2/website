Subject: Re: [T2] Brake pedal bump stop help needed 70 bus

Hiya Adam,

Yeah!  I'd like to know where you found a new one too!

I had to do this little chore on my Bus last year. Really had to scrounge the 
boneyards to find one of those little buggers in good shape.

I got mine in by doing the following.  I had a friend below hold the stop and 
position it so that the &quot;prongs&quot; were started in the holes.  Oh, by the way, 
just prior to this we had sprayed the prongs with Tri-Flow, a lubricant.  
Anyway he pushed up on the stop and from above I grabbed the tip of the prong 
with a pair of needle nose pliers and pulled.  Gotta be careful not to break 
the rubber at this point - take it nice and easy.  Do a little gentle side to 
side circular kinda motions and it will pop up and into place.  It is a tight 
fit though!
