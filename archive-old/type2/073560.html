&gt; Here is the trick...
&gt; Drill 2 (about 9mm)holes....At the point where the heat riser tube makes

&gt;
&gt; Find a welding rod (1/8&quot;) and strip all the shielding from it
&gt; bend a small area in it, almost like a hook. chuck it intal a drill, and
&gt; insert into the blocked area...Ream the heck out of it and keep soaking it
&gt; with spray carburetor cleaner..
&gt;
&gt; After you are done, weld the 2 holes back up and you are done..

I do the same thing, except that I block the hole with a stainless hose
clamp.  A film of red RTV seals it up fine.  Next time, I can ream it out
without further drilling.  I only drill one side, btw.

&gt; This is the best method I have found to get all the crud out.....Using the
&gt; proper heat riser gaskets, which are really hard to find does the job and
&gt; keeps the heat riser flow going only one direction, keeping this from
&gt; happening......

Hmmm, which are the correct gaskets, the big hole ones or the teeny hole
ones?  which goes where?
