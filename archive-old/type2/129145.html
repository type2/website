Subject: Fix fogging around edge of winshield

Hi all,
      Is there any poor mans way to fix or decrease the fogging that 
occurs around older winshields as the layers separate? I've got the 
windshield of my wife's '70 bus out, and it's fogged in to the 
windshield about 2 inches (5 cm)--and I'm hoping there's something I 
could do to at least decrease it.

Thanks,
John
