&gt; viewed from the outside, with the lights off. With the lights on, this same
&gt; coating at first made the lights seem unfocused and diffused when viewed from
&gt; any angle but straight on. From straight on, however, the lights are
&gt; EXTREMELY bright and crisply focused. But only from that position.
