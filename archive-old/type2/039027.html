Well, my top pops straight up also.  There is a luggage rack over the
driver, and the rest of the roof pops up.  There is a bed with another board
that can be slid forward to make for a huge sleeping area.

Back seat folds down and extends the area the over engine are to make
another bed.

There is a propane stove and a fridge.

There is also a plate on the side of van that I just noticed that reads
something along the lines of
Manufactured by: Automotive Services
2001 W. 4th Plain
Vancouver, WN

I am not sure but I am guessing WN is supposed to be Washington, even though
I know Washington to be WA.  Mapquest shows this to be a valid address, but
I don't know if they actually did the conversion or if they are still there.

Thanks all.

Mike

mike,
there were a bunch of companies out there doing the
camper conversion thing, if you could describe the pop
top and accesories im sure someone on the list could
identify it for you.   i have a riviera camper for
instance where my pop top goes straight up, but the
cabinetry looks very similar to the westy's.   can't
wait to here what kind it is.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; Picked up an '81 Vanagon (still aircooled -
&gt; wooohoooo!!) and it has a bunch
&gt; of camper stuff, including a pop top.  At first I
&gt; thought Westfalia, but
&gt; then I started looking around and didn't see
&gt; anything with the Westfalia's
&gt; name on it.  There are lots of things that tell me
&gt; this conversion was done
&gt; in the states.  Like when I open the cabinets, the
&gt; hinges say USA.   So my
&gt; question(s):
&gt; 
&gt; Were there companies other than Westfalia that did
&gt; conversions?  Who were
&gt; they?  Any still around?  Did they use the Westfalia
&gt; parts?  Am I stuck with
&gt; something I am not going to be able to find parts
&gt; for (camping stuff)?  Any
&gt; other comments?
