Subject: Re: [T2] Actual shipping

My business occasionally ships items to customers, and there are a couple
additional considerations to what has been discussed so far.

First, if I don't know the exact actual shipping amount, I need to call it
&quot;shipping and handling.&quot;  Since it's hard to know the exact actual shipping
total before the order is packed, most companies provide an estimate.
However, if you estimate $6 and the actual cost is $5, you have overcharged
the customer for shipping.  Suppliers have been forced in court to refund
this difference.  However, if you call it &quot;shipping and handling,&quot; the extra
$1 can be your handling fee.

Second, customers pay for handling one way or the other.  Businesses that
are extremely price competitive will try to strip any extra cost out of the
retail price of their goods and add it somewhere else.  Other businesses
include the &quot;handling&quot; cost in the regular retail price.  So, what is
better?  A $20 item with a $1 handling fee or a $21 item with no handling
fee?  If you know that customers don't look at handling costs and your
biggest competitor is advertising that item for $20, you might be inclined
to take the first route.
