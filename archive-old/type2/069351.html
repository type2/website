&gt; &gt; hmm...about the ideas of accually using ENGINE compression to inflat the
&gt; &gt; tire,
&gt; &gt;  know this subject has been broached before, but, then they were accually
&gt; &gt; talking about building compressors out of engines, so..
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; anyhow, the little gadgets like the one guy has &lt;and Muir describes&gt; uses
&gt; &gt; OUTSIDE AIR to fill tire. unlike say,m a compression tester, and a tire
&gt; &gt; valve fitting. The later would introduce into your tire the SAME mizture
&gt; 
&gt; Nope, like I said on a FI bus this is not a problem, simply disconnect
&gt; the injectors power leads and the cold start leads just to be sure
&gt; and voila should be no, or at least an incredible minor amount of
&gt; fuel in the resulting mixture, I'd let some escape first to be sure.
&gt; Really seems the key to me on a fuel injected vehicle.  Carbed and
&gt; diesels are like I said SOL.
