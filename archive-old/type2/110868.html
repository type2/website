Subject: Re: [T2] Slip Streaming a Semi on I-95

&gt; PS.  Since 90% of the accidents occur within 3 miles
&gt; of your home, I will 
&gt; patiently wait until I get outside that radius.  No
&gt; use tempting . . .

Always heard it was 25 miles, so unless their in the
middle of nowhere, it's a good chance someone else out
there is either 3/25 miles from &quot;their&quot; home!  The
insurance companies must have patted themselves on the
back for thinking up that stat.

Stan
