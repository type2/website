&gt; Good to hear you're making progress on the '79. Looked to me like you 
&gt; really didn't have *that* far to go with it.
&gt;
&gt; I'm not really sure of the status of the valve. It's #3E, has been 
&gt; getting tight almost since the engine was new. Strange, considering it 
&gt; has a doghouse. Anyway, on my way down to New Orleans this month I 
&gt; stopped off at David Schwarze's place in Dallas (list admin) and 
&gt; checked me valves there, at the 3,000 mile mark. #3E was .003, tighter 
&gt; than it had ever gotten before. Set it back to .006, then finished the 
&gt; trip - another 3,000 miles through Texas, Louisiana, New Mexico ... all 
&gt; pretty hot places. Engine ran fine, little hotter than usual but that's 
&gt; to be expected, so I didn't think much about the valve. Got home on 
&gt; Monday and checked them all. That one had about .005 of *negative* 
&gt; clearance (in other words it was holding the valve open, at least when 
&gt; the engine was cold). I'm waiting on a borrowed compression tester to 
&gt; check it out, but after I reset everything the engine stills runs fine, 
&gt; still has four good pulses from the exhaust, nothing seems terribly 
&gt; amiss. If it is burned, it's only just started. My experience is that 
&gt; valve clearances get larger when the engine's hot, so I'm theorizing 
&gt; that even after stretching, #3E was still closing on the seat (albeit 
&gt; briefly, and probably not an airtight seal but good enough to keep the 
&gt; gas-cutting to a minimum). All this is extreme postulation until the 
&gt; compression tester arrives, so I will update you then. If it's more 
&gt; than 10 psi below the others I will plan on a head job this summer. In 
&gt; any case my valve adjustment intervals just became a lot shorter, like 
&gt; 1,000 miles for that valve and 2,000 for all the others. As they say, 
&gt; your mileage may vary.

Mick,

You might want to consider torque'ing your heads if you didn't at the 
300-1000 mile mark.

Generally, I wouldn't expect a tightening #3E to point towards a 
loosening head, but a head that's not torqued to spec can do weird 
things -- trust me.

Again, your assessment of &quot;do a compression check&quot; is probably the best 
first step, but after that you might want to torque the lower four nuts 
on each head (or all eight if you're feeling spry and like you want to 
do an engine pull), do your valves, then check the compression again.  
If you find that any of the lower eight (four on each side) nuts are 
loose and that torque'ing these bottom nuts makes a difference in your 
compression, you can then assess whether you want to pull the engine and 
torque all eight.

hope this helps,
