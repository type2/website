&gt;Looks like the spare tire mounted up front is still OK
&gt;Wasn't somebody looking for one of these recently?
&gt;Poor fellow.
&gt;A fire extinguisher is a very necessary device for our busses that we all
&gt;love and cherish.
&gt;


Just installed one today in my 82 Westy. Last one was used up on the engine
fire by PO last year. Installed a Kidde Fireaway 110 ABC rated. Only costs
$12.99 from K-mart.  Kiddie told me I need to vent the vehicle in the summer
because it is rated to 120 degrees F. It is DOT certified for auto.
