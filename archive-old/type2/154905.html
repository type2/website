Subject: Dashboard attachment screws

I checked out my dashboard after reading the post about removing the top of
the dashboard and noticed that on my bus a number of different screw were
used to attach the dash to the bus.  Can someone let me know what the
correct screws for this task for both the sides (2 on each side) and the
ones near the windshield.  Along with the screw thread, I would appreciate
knowing length, the head type (hex or Phillips or .) and what washers, if
any, are to be used.

 

TIA,

 

Wayne
