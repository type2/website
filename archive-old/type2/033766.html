&gt;[should I be cc'ing this to the list?]

If you think it would benefit another bus owner someday, then I would say yes.

&gt;&gt; Pulses should all be the same, if not, it indicates one or more weak
&gt;&gt; cylinders.
&gt;
&gt;Hard to say, it catches on almost immediately.

Pull the coil wire before you crank it.  :)

&gt;*Very* weird behaviour from the engine here:
&gt;- If I pull the wire from cyl. 4, it instantly dies. Tried it four
&gt;times now.

That IS wierd.  It would seem to indicate that cylinder 4 is doing the
majority of the work at idle.

&gt;- If I pull the wire from cyl. 3, the RPMs drop like expected. Not too
&gt;much, but noticable.

It should produce a noticeable &quot;lope&quot; in the engine. RPM drop should be
around 100-200rpm.

&gt;- If I pull the wire from cyl. 2, it actually speeds up if I allow
&gt;sparks to fly through the air (&gt;1.5 cm!), but if I put it back the
&gt;wire it goes back to the old RPM. Which is the same as when I do not
&gt;allow the sparks to fly, by the way.

I've seen this effect before.  Unfortunately my troubleshooting procedures
at the time were not methodical enough and I never found out what caused
it.  It shouldn't be happening though - the idle should speed up with the
wire connected or with the spark jumping, and slow down with no spark.

&gt;- If I pull the wire from cyl. 1, nothing happens to the RPMs.

Aha!

&gt;- At higher engine speeds (idle RPM is not constant) however,
&gt;cyl. 2 and cyl. 1 disconnection does seem to have the correct effect.

At higher engine speeds, other things are going on.  At higher engine
speeds, you have both idle and main fuel circuits contributing, and the
effects of low compression are not as pronounced because there is less time
for compression to escape from the combustion chamber when the engine is
spinning faster.

&gt;I guess that means cyls. 1&amp;2 need overhaul. And that means engine
&gt;removal... Hmm. I've never liked the idea of doing that.

Don't conclude that just yet.  We were using the idle-wire-pull test to try
and get an estimate of compression.  While a drop in rpm is a sure
indication of at least *some* compression, no drop doesn't necessarily mean
no compression.  This gets back to the assumption that your fuel/spark
systems are working 100%.  I think your idle circuit on the right carb may
not be working properly.  Have you fiddled with the set screw in the
throttle body yet?  Have you checked for vacuum leaks at the carb/manifold
and manifold/head junctions?  Search the archives at http://vw.i405_dot_com for
info on how to check both of these things.  Also I would recommend getting
a copy of the Bentley manual for 68-79 busses.  It has a good procedure for
adjusting the dual carbs.

&gt;I'll try to borrow one, or ask a local garage. The trouble is that it
&gt;is not exactly *my* bus, I share it with a few friends. The friends
&gt;however, do not really share my enthousiasm when it comes to get their
&gt;hands dirty.

That's unfortunate, but maybe they would contribute to the cost of the
tester, since you're doing the dirty work?  Since the results of the
wire-pull test were not conclusive, I would say the next step needs to be
giving the engine a proper compression test (with the gauge).
