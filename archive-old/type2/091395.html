&gt; &gt; &gt;I &quot;think&quot; 11 or 12 yards depending how well you
&gt; lay out the cuts.

&gt; &gt; I asked this question once and got a few numbers
&gt; in the 12 yards range.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I took a friend's Riviera to a local upholstery
&gt; shop and got an estimate of
&gt; &gt; 12-15 yards including the top bed.
&gt; 
&gt; Good point. I didnt include a top bed in my 11-12.
&gt; 


Buy top bed do you mean the upper bunk?  Mine's the
factory cot type, but again in the '72 is the rear
facing seat too (but you know that).
