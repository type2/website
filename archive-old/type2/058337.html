Subject: motors numbers '73 pick up in europe

cheers folks,

I recently picked  up somewhat battered 73 pick up at a low price and
was aware it needed some serious motor work. It came with an upright 16
AD series motor, which is non-standard, but works and does the work i
need it to do and i have worked on them before.

Now here is the interesting bit. It also  came with another motor, which
as a former type 1 (bug) and type 3 (estate/square back) owner, i have
never seen before. It has a serial number that begins with CT. Like the
square back should have a rear or car mounted fan and has a mount for an
oil filter. English language manuals say the motor for this 73 type 2
should be a Type VI.

I was told by another net citizen that it could be a type vi motor and 
as such has very different tranny mounts from something that takes a
1600 AD series motor. But the heads, which are dual port seem very close
to a most 1600 heads i have seem.

So i have three questions: 
1. Has anyone any idea what this motor could be with a serial number
beginning with CT.
2. As far as i can tell the tranny is still original, but a 1600 motor
is there. Are the mounts for type vi motors different from earlier
models?
3. will type VI (if it is) fit 1600 motors?

brgrds,
david
