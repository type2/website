From: &quot;TR Gesell&quot; &lt;trgesell_at_compuserve_dot_com&gt;
&gt; I'd agree with the other posters that cutting/drilling/welding brake
structural components would be a bad, bad idea.

Last month there was a thread on this topic on the quatro list (another
casting project).  Source: http://www.audifans_dot_com

Someone posted a series of pics of a car where one of the rear &quot;drilled&quot;
disks catastrophically failed.  Upon failure, the disk shattered the wheel
and immediately disabled the vehicle.  The wheel literally broke up into
pieces too small to support the tire.  Had it been a front disk and not one
of the rears...

This was a factory disk, and not one that someone had drilled themselves,
though some confusion over this led to the discussion that followed.
