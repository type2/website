Don't bother with a spray booth - use your backyard, driveway or garage.

It WILL be messy so the driveway or yard is better. (OVERSPRAY). Watch for 
overspray problems on your house or car and the neighbors stuff as well.

Get it prepped and plan to paint in the early hours of a day (morning, 
cool, fewer insects flying around).

Spray the ground or floor down with the water hose to control dust. Have 
the bus as ready as you can the night before so all you have to is wipe the 
bus down the final time - check for bird poop and such really well. Tack 
rags are good.

Borrow or rent a small air compressor - we've sprayed with very cheap 
compressors that didn't even have tanks but their limited air output (CFM) 
will limit you to pretty cheesy spray guns.

Practice a little. Be sure that you have the right chemistry (right 
reducers or thinners for the temps you are working with). Be sure 
temperature and humidity are reasonable (the paint cans will tell you what 
is okay).

You might have the van masked out the night before and store it inside and 
move it outside for the actual paint.

The better the equipment, the more careful you are with prep, the better 
the paint (to a point) the better your results. HOWEVER I have seen good 
paint jobs done by careful body men using basic tractor and implement 
paints. There is a visible difference but you won't cry as much if 
something happens to the paint job.

Every paint store has different lines of paint - levels of cost and 
quality. I used the cheapest for my first painting lessons (self taught) 
and with decent results. I'd hate to waste hundreds of dollars of paint on 
a paint job that will be still be an amateur's first attempt which will 
have it's mistakes no matter how careful you are.

I'd suggest doing it all yourself and learn. Use the cheaper cost solutions 
and maybe on your next paint job you'll feel confident in trying something 
better (more expensive).

CHEAP paint - Tractor Supply Co. - gallons of several colors and shades for 
$15.

BETTER - cheap auto body supplier paints - maybe $40 or so for a gallon. 
You'll need more chemistry for the proper prep of the paint for the spray 
gun and for the primers and such.Acrylic enamels and lacquers are here. 
Lacquers by the way have no gloss to them until they are rubbed forever. 
They look great based on the amount of effort you give them but the rubbing 
can last forever. The enamels are much like spray can paint.

Above that comes the base and clearcoat paints like found on new cars. Not 
difficult but alot more money involved.

Best? The sky is the limit and the opinions are far reaching as to who 
makes the best paints. Saw a thing on TV where each gallon of some special 
pearl type paint was over a thousand bucks - they were spraying it on 
custom motorycles (Harley type bikes) that went for $50K+.

My recipe for cheap? Acrylic enamel + hardener. Hardener adds gloss and 
toughness. Also more brittle and likely to get deep chips under the right 
circumstances.

Any shade of any color (cheap paint solid colors I mean) is more or less 
the same price - they can mix it for you. Be careful if you make up a color 
not in the catalog, they may have a hard time matching it - depends on the 
skill of the operator.

Under that was a final layer of thick high build primer. Was a urethane I 
believe. Under that was a water based sealant coating - not sanded - just 
sprayed - regular spray gun used. Under that was cheap lacquer based 
primer. The top coat high build primer seals the lacquer primer I was told.

Not the best recipe but has lasted for several years now. Has a life span 
of 5 or 6 years if treated right - more possible if in the garage less if 
abused.

By the way - the poptop was simply sanded many times but hand and then 
sprayed and sanded many times with the same urethane high build primer and 
then top coated with the same acrylic enamel paint. I fiber glassed any 
real cracks and then the high build primer + sanding took care of the worn 
gel coat on the poptop.

There are certainly several flaws in my job but the paint did it's job.

If you use cheap bondo beware that you need to top coat it fairly quickly 
(within days) as if absorbs moisture and rust can start under it or the 
paint may bubble.

The better solution is aluminum impregnated filler why applies and works 
the same but once dry is a real pain in the rear because it gets so hard. A 
difference of maybe $10 or $15 a gallon.

Use sanding blocks for sanding (working the body towards paint). Electric 
and air sanders are okay for stripping - stay off the edges - and beware of 
heat which can be caused by the friction of a power sander and actual warp 
panels.

Finally when you think you are ready for color - lightly prime the vehicle 
with a different colored primer and block it again. Any place that you sand 
through to the previous color primer represents a high spot. You can see 
the waves - the high spots and low spots on a big flat panelled vehicle 
like a VW van - I've got plenty.

A really good idea would be to make friends with someone who can do 
bodywork and have them check you from time to time - also they can help you 
with paint chemistry.

Hope this helps a little.

&gt;Hi All!
&gt;
&gt;Before I start, let me state clearly that I do NOT want to start up the 
&gt;argument over what kind of paint, primer, etc, is the best!
&gt;
&gt;What I'm interested in is painting my bus in some sort of psychedelic 
&gt;paint scheme. Has anyone got some advice on painting your own bus? I'm 
&gt;sure renting a paint booth and spray gun would be the 'best' route but it 
&gt;sounds expensive. I do want a good paint job but I'd like to do it on the 
&gt;cheap!
&gt;
&gt;TIA

&gt;And what is not good---
&gt;Need we ask anyone to tell us these things?
