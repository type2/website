Subject: Re: [T2] temp sensor II question...like where is it:)

Yea, you found it.  It really is tiny.  The wire you
found does arrive to the T2 sensor.  The T2 sensor
itself is only slightly larger than the head of a
bolt; but it has the wire coming straight out of the
top.  
    
Here is a picture of one:

It's part number is BOS-0-280-130-012.  It's about $20
from a variety of sources.  And woe to the Fuel
Injected Bus owner who is trying to drive their bus
when this T2 sensor has failed!
