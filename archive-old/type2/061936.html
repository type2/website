Subject: Re: Engine from a beetle to fit a t2

There are some variables to consider when you think about engine cooling
tin and engine components (e.g. carb, heads, year of bus (1967? - 1971
took 1600's, etc.).

One difference between some beetle engines and the bus engine is that
beetle engines have no support bracket in the back (rear of bug) of the
engine. Some beetle engines won't accept the rear bracket. Others (with
universal cases) will. Still others must have holes drilled (VERY
carefully) and tapped to accept the bracket. Lots of folks mount the
beetle engines in the bus and forget the bracket, or use an aftermarket
bracket that mounts to the oil cooler bolts. Some think this is unwise.

I think we need more data. What year bus? What year beetle engine?
