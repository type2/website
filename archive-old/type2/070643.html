Slowly reemerging after EveryBus. I will get to that in another post.

The bus in question is a 1972 Westy with the standard 72 brake setup: 
front disk brakes with vacuum power assist.

When applying the brakes the pedal is pulsing. Typically this would 
be indicative of warped disk rotors. However in the case the pulsing 
is not consistent. In fact, there are times when braking is smooth 
and silky. The pulsing seems to come and go. Some trips start out 
with a pulsing pedal and end smoothly while others start out smoothly 
and end with a pulsing pedal. A dial caliper has not been applied to 
situation to test the disks but perhaps soon.

Could this be a brake servo related problem? BTW, the servo seems to 
work and there is no brake fluid loss from the system. Braking is 
straight and well within acceptable distance. Just the other day I 
looked them up to avoid certain disaster.

Thanks
