Subject: Need Eberspacher Parts

I just picked up a 71' eberspacher BN4 gas heater for my westfalia and
need to replace the fuel pump and relay-time switch.  I was checking
here first to see if anyone had these parts to sell or if anyone knew a
company where I could buy replacement parts.  If it helps, the part
numbers are:

fuel pump (12V)
20 1722 04 01 00 or vw 311 261 467

relay-time switch
20 1415 00 00 05 or vw 311 963 141

I was hoping that someone had a bad or broken heater and would not mind
selling some of the parts off of it.

I appreciate any help or suggestions,
