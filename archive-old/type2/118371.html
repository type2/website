Subject: AIRS help

Kyle is heading to NC
He is in walterboro, SC , he is at the Waffle House off 95 near mile 53.  He
called me from a payphone and said he would try and stay near.  His number
at that pay phone is 843 538 3914

He Has a 79 Automatic that is pouring tranny fluid between engine and
tranny.  It is red fluid so is tranny fluid.

Needs a gasket and a place to work.  Or if ya just want to try and help.

He has never attempted an engine drop and doesn't have many tools. If any
one could help him out or point him in right direction.  Give him a call. I
got this call at 3:15 PM Sun.

I told him if he gets better contact info or needs more help to give me a
call.

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
