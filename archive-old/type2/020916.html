Subject: Help re endplay shims!

Must ask the august list (remember, bus depot is a 2 hr trip, gotta
finish this by Mon)- my '78 crank endplay is 10 thou and I want to get
it to 3 or 4- so figger I need to increase shims by 6  o 7 thou- current
stack is about 35 thou (why is combo of measured individuals shims
greater than sum of parts- ie, 37 thou)?????  Unfortunately my shims and
ones on a junker run between 10 up to 12.5 and no combo of 3 or even 4
would work- so gotta ask 2 things
1.  Is running 4 shims any problem physically speaking (George Lyle, you
there?)- I could use 4 and also the following:
2. Any reason paper made shims can't be inserted between any 2 metal
ones to increase stack thickness?  (I remember, in the 71 I had, a paper
shim is used to bring out the flywheel, but it's fixed and doesn't
spin)-since crushed lazer paper is about 2 thou I could also bring out
the flywheel a hair and use the 4 lowest shims?)
3. Is the 71 crank the same diameter, if I root hard enough, I may find
some of them??
