Subject: pushrod tube seals ?

fellow listmembers...

I got to starting the pushrod tube seal job today, and ran into my first 
snag. How the heck do you get the driver side/far right pushrod out with the 
EGR filter in the way?

I removed some of the cooling tin to get a better look at the underside of 
the pushrod tubes and only saw one that was even sort of grimy, and I 
*think* its from oil coming down above, not a bad seal, but I replaced that 
one anyway. I wanted to do them all anyway, since technically the milage 
calls for it, but if I can't get that pushrod out, I don't know that I could 
get the psurod tube out...

any suggestions?

now, I am back to hunting down this oil leak...
