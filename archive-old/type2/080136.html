&gt; Perhaps so.  In that case, replace &quot;take&quot; with &quot;understand&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; The presence of a rigid and lightweight wheel on the front of a bus will
&gt; do little but ensure that an additional object will intrude into the
&gt; passenger compartment if you hit something.  It doesn't provide crush
&gt; space (it doesn't crusb before the sheet metal), so it is relatively
&gt; useless.

But wouldn't the tire and wheel also serve to spread the impact over a
greater area and therefore provide a greater amount of structure to absorb
said impact? I thought that would be a good thing.
