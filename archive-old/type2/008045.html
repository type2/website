Just some knick knacks in the basement for sale or willing to trade
for 66 Bus parts:

4 legged stool blue/green plaid
front seats blue/green plaid
upper cabinet
2 side cabinets one 74/75 one 76-79
good front and rear bumpers

May bring these to Tom Forhan's party but am skeptical to go because
the van is a mess and I am running on two  spare tires, Any Annapolis
listees want to take me! Any out of towners coming through I could
probably put you up for Saturday or Sunday night.  Terps play Kentucky
Sat night, go Terps.

Take care,
Patrick Flynn
