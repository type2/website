Shelby Bell sends:

&gt; i know when i bought my riviera camper here in
&gt; nebraska, the PO had RV plates on it.  i registered it
&gt; however in NY and they didnt have a problem giving me
&gt; regular car plates for it.  when i filled out my
&gt; paperwork i just listed it as a 1973 volkswagen van.
&gt; so it might just depend on who you talk to at the DMV.
&gt; id go try again.  funny how if i remember correctly a
&gt; few months ago we were having the exact opposite
&gt; conversation since someone wanted to get RV plates but
&gt; the DMV was hassling them:)  it seems you just can't
&gt; win for losing with those people.  good luck.

I've seen plenty of American-made conversion vans with non-RV plates on
them. A Westfalia or Riviera is also a conversion van, so it should be
treated similarly...taking photos of the backs of conversion vans that are
tagged with non-RV plates may prove useful some day at the DMV.
