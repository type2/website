Subject: my engine with dual dellorto drla 40

Hello

As i cant find much information on people on the web with engine type 4 with
dual dellorto in their bus (westy), ill post mine:
http://www.chez_dot_com/westfalia/moteurwest.html

Sorry its in french but the main objective here is the pictures.

I have all sandblasted and powdercoated my tin, my dellorto are from italy
from an alfa and i had to hunt for part (venturi,jets...)  i also adapt a
linkage from an alfa, i found interesting to adapt it because its on ball
bearing!

I can say now that 6 inch velocity stack DO fit in a baywindows (1973), i
even have 2-3 inch clearance over my top velocity stack.  the only problem
is i had to remove my BN4, but im using thick ntake gasket (head to
manifold) now im thinking using small papuer gasket and maybe ill have
enough space for the BN4 ...  but now the engine is out (i put a type 1
engine for now) because it didnt perform as expected... run too rich black
smoke and tumbles, im looking maybe for the CB performance update kit or
emulsion tube...

As for air filter, i used cheap personnal air filter (a dust mask for
working or painting) and it work well, not a show winner but eficient and
cheap ...

more picture about all these in a few weeks...

i still working on this, i plan to put back the engine in my bay in 2-3
weeks ... with a FI in backup in case it doesnt run well... but until now im
fascinated by those nice dellortos!!
