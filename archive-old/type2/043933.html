Subject: [T2] Freeing Up Seized Engine

I have recently acquired a 78 Bus with stock everything.....
only problem is..the motor is seized from sitting for long time.

I have been told that a mixture of diesel fuel and
penetrating oil....poured into the cylinders and into
crankcase will free the engine..???

Any thoughts from the list on this? Any other type of
fluids to pour in there??

Really don't want to remove engine..if at all possible...
apparently motor worked prior to lack of use.....

Thx...
Glen
