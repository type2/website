Why don't you just make an extension instead of pulling everything

&gt; Hello Folks,
&gt;      Took today and tomorrow off work to get the '77 finished. One thing on
&gt; the list to do was change out the dashboard-idiot PO cut out the radio area
&gt; to install some cheesy POS radio he bought at a yard sale, then never
&gt; installed it. Anyway, it went fairly well with one exception-the plastic
&gt; duct from the center tube does not fit, when connected to the dash vents (on
&gt; top) it leaves about a 1 inch gap at the bottom where it connects to the
&gt; center tube. The dash is from a '76, and I can't believe anything would have
&gt; changed in the duct work from '76 to '77, but who knows. Everything else
&gt; lined up fine. I believe the duct work from the donor bus is still there,
&gt; but it is 50 miles away, and I won't be able to get until Monday. Side note-
&gt; I picked up a really cool roof rack at a yard sale, I should have some pics
&gt; posted of it by tomorrow.
