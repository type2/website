Subject: Happy Turkey Day

Fellow Listees,
I hope everyone had a wonderful Turkey Day, I had a good one myself. Saw
family &amp; friends, and get to see more over the weekend. I thought I'd
share part of the blessing from our &quot;Thanksgiving Table&quot; , one of those
deals where everybody gets to say what their thankful for. My
brother-in-law, 1 splitie, 2 loafs, 1 aircooled vanagon, and 1
waterpumper vanagon, gave thanks for &quot;air-cooled engines&quot; when it was
his turn and that was it. Plain, simple and to the point- air cooled.
Anyways following grub we went out and took the altenator off the 85
waterpumper, and then off to go look at a fuel-injected loaf a local
mechanic said he was holding on to with us in mind.
                                                                 Being
Thankful, (can't tell you why)

Mike 73 Westy
