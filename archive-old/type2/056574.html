&gt;2) I would like to acquire a pre-drilled sump plate for installing a VDO
&gt;oil temperature gauge sender.  I know that Bus Boys sells them -- does
&gt;anyone know of any other parts suppliers (or others) that sell them?

Automobile Atlanta, 505 South Marietta Parkway, Marietta, GA 30060
or (404) 427-2844 (in the Atlanta, GA area) has them in their catalog of
Porsche 914 stuff (which has bascially the same engine as the 72-83 aircooled
buses/vanagons).

it's $45, part number 039-919-268, but that INCLUDES the plate, a new gasket,
and the VDO pressure sender for the VDO oil pressure gauge. their catalog is
pretty neat, and you Type 4 engined folks might want to get it. for example,
they also have the oil pressure sending unit AND mounting hose kit (with
mounting bracket) for $60 (so you can screw this in place of your current
oil pressure sender).

just a thought.
