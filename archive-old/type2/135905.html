Subject: Cooling fan issues

Last summer my cooling fan rusted out at the hub, it took me awhile but I 
finally figured it out (it sounded horrible). I replaced it a used one from 
probably a beetle and has been fine ever since.

Well, something is wrong again.  At low rpm's it sound &quot;kluncky&quot; at high 
rpm's it sounds fine.  I am thinking its the angular momentum (the real phyics 
term for centripetal force) holding in the right place.

You think I just pick a bad fan, and it went bad again. Or can be something.
