Hi all - I did a quick search of the archives, and didn't find answers to 
these, so..... My steering is very loose (in my '76), like 5 inches of 
play. So I watched the linkages as my wife wiggled the wheel within the 
play, and the steering box, drop arm, and drag link all moved well. The 
motion was lost at the connection between the drag link and the relay arm 
of the torsion-thingy (the one that pivots on the torsion bar). Am I right 
to assume that the tie-rod-end (although it is not on a tie rod) on the 
drag link connecting it to the relay arm is bad? Am I right to assume that 
I have to buy an entire new drag link - the ends alone are not sold?

I'll try to adjust the length of the drag link to that of the old one, but 
will I need to get the van aligned afterwards?

Can I remove the drag link using a two armed wheel puller? Bentley says do 
not use a hammer, Muir says use a hammer.  After all, I am removing it to 
be replaced, so I guess I can trash it!

Thanks in advance for any advice. Please CC my email address in any 
replies.

Jesse
