ok....I also have a 71 westy.... my blinkers do the same thing...
the engine must be running in order for the blinkers to work.... if the key is
just turned to the on position without the engine running....both of the
lights blink....if the engine is running.... the blinkers work as normal...
Thats what I have found....am i right?
I also have the wiring diagram if anyone needs it....for a 71

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;    I'm looking for help with an electrical problem on our 71 westy.
&gt; When we use the turn signals, left or right, the exterior lights work
&gt; properly but both lights on the dash blink.  Things appear to be wired
&gt; correctly.  Is this normal for this year?  Any and all suggestions welcome
&gt; as I'm tired of laying on my back and tracing wires under the dash.
