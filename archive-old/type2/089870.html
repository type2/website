Subject: Re: [T2] 79 f.i. loom

The injection system electrical appears to be the same from 77 to 83 
unless you have a california vehicle. .finally found a number for the 
&quot;harness for electr. contr. mdul&quot;  (071  971 761) for 80 to  83 cv 
engines but no harness is listed  for prior to 80    the number you had 
is the cap to the plug going to the control module.   this part is 
common for 70s and 80s bus.  the harness prior to 80 is a no longer 
listed item.  dont know what the differences would have been when most 
of the system is the same.

&gt; Hoping to reach Billy with this.
&gt; If your 82 Westy has an FI, try the wireloom from the 82.
&gt; I've got an extra 80-83 wireloom but I'm not sure it will fit a 79, I
&gt; know it will plug into a 78 AFM with 7 pins. They all pretty much use 
&gt; the
&gt; standard components like resistor, double relay, control head, temp
&gt; sender, thermo time switch and idle compensator valve.
