First let me say that I have met Ron Salmon and think he is a good man.  He
let me be sick in his house for a few days while on my journey.  I also saw
the way he runs his business and although it wasn't quite as I imagined it.


I know he tries to do a good job and most times all goes well with that
focus.  I don't think he intended the order to get messed up, but to be
direct, his employee may have totally mis-combobulated the request.  Let's
chalk it all up to human error, and get over it!!!!

I have never met Laurin, the person that started this thread in the first
place but I must say I appreciate his honesty, candor, and the boldness to
criticize (in his opinion) a, shall we say, &quot;valued member&quot; of this
listserv.  I don't see where he was attacking RON, but some seem to be
taking it that way.

I read the comments and know what the original post said.  In following the
thread further I saw all sorts of folks coming to the percieved rescue of
Bus Depot.  I don't believe this is in order at all.  The fact is that even
the best businesses recieve complaints and acrue customers that through
some disatisfaction become anti-whatever the business is.

I don't think Ron or his business need any help from any of us to make sure
he is not hurt by the comment(s).  Kudo's to Ron for being a good guy
trying to make it in the small business world, and kudos to the Schmidt for
speaking his opinion honestly the way he saw it.

After that initial post, and Ron's rebuttal we maybe should have dropped
it, and let Ron work it out with HIS customer, or at least disgruntled
customer.  If RMMW screws up we are not so quick to justify the nasty deed
are we?  NO, we see them as being less impersonal than maybe Ron's
business.  And honestly so do I.

Ron when I finally get a job and a steady paycheck I will buy from you.  I
don't schedule my work ahead of time so it doesn't matter much when the
parts get here.  : )  Tell Evon I said hi.  I think I still owe you for a
tune-up set or do I, please let me know.

I have said it before, 'No one is the catch-all expert best on this list&quot;.
And no one business is either.  IMHO of course.

And thats all I have to say about that...........  : )

PS:  Hell Laurin, if they jump you too bad and you need a place to vent
then send the complaintive message to me.  Hell, I'll read anything and
everybody knows I can always give you an opinion.  : )
