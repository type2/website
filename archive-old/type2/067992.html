&gt;
&gt; How are busses as off road vehicles?  I have no real plans to do any
&gt; offroading but would like to know what to watch out for if I do.
&gt; Anyone ever push the limits of their bus (mine is a '77 westy) in the
&gt; great outdoors?

This brings back a bad memory. This is a little long, but I think
writing it might help rid me of a few demons. 

On a rainy day in Los Angeles a few years ago, I found myself in the
Topanga area and decided that it might be a fun day to drive back to
west LA via Mulholland Drive. Most folks are probably familiar with
Mulholland drive in the Hollywood area, where it's a well-maintained,
well-traveled road winding through the mountains that separate LA from
the valley. However, the 15-mile stretch from Topanga to Bel-Air is all
dirt. 

I'd driven it before in my '71 bus, and it didn't occur to me that it
would be much different in the rain. (stupid, stupid, stupid) As I was
heading up the last paved street before dirt Mulholland, I passed a guy
in a baja-bug heading the other way. He had huge tires, caked with mud.
He gave me a warning look and tried to get my attention as he passed.
However, I wasn't ready to decide that I was doing something really
stupid, yet.

Finally, I hit the dirt road, or, rather, the *mud* road. Still, the bus
seemed to be doing fine. I knew that having the engine over the drive
wheels made a big difference. Then I began to notice a few things. I
noticed that the road was a lot steeper, up and down, than I remembered.
I noticed that the hard-packed dirt and rock of the Santa Monica
mountains turned to the consistancy of crude oil when it got wet, and
provided about as much traction. I noticed that the hillside a few feet
from my wheel dropped off much more steeply than I had previously
thought.

I began to think of all the old, crushed, rusted cars that I'd seen on
the hill side below the mountains' dirt roads. I used to wonder how they
got there.

The next thing I noticed was that, though having the weight of the
engine on the drive wheels gave me enough traction to move forward, the
bus really didn't seem to have much idea about in which direction
&quot;forward&quot; lay. It was particularly bad when I tried to slow down on
downhills; the wheels would all lock up and the bus would start to slide
sideways, often towards the lip of the road. My great discovery,
however, was that the emergency brake locked only the rear wheels, and I
could actually, sort of, steer. Around this time, I decided it was time
to admit that I had done something really stupid, and that the only
responsible thing to do was to stop the bus in a place where it wouldn't
slide off the mountain by itself, and walk out of there.

That, of course, is exactly what I didn't do. Instead, I turned around
and tried to drive out. This gave me a chance to notice one last thing,
which was that that the long, steep downhill parts of the road I had
survived on the way in now became long, steep uphills which the bus
could barely climb. I'd hit a hill at the bottom and gradually slow down
more and more, wheels spinning. Each climb got harder and harder.
Finally, I got to the last one and just barely, barely made it over the
top.

As I got to back to the pavement, I saw the guy in the baja bug. He
looked relieved to see me alive. I tried not to make eye contact as I
passed him, but pulled over as soon as I was out of his sight and waited
until I stopped shaking before I drove home. On paved streets.
