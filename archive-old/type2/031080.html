&gt; I have a 74 westy with a stock 1800 that needs a rebuild and I'm thinking
&gt; about upgrading it to a 2 liter.

with the same set up (carb to carb or FI to FI) the 1800-2000 is a very
simple swap

&gt; Any advice from folks who've done this, or know what's involved, would be
&gt; appreciated.

did it, and used a 411/412 engine and it was more or less a bolt fit

&gt; I'm thinking the 2000 would give me more lowend torque for the mountains
&gt; around here (Seattle).

yup
&gt; 
&gt; things like:
&gt; * carburetion (dual stock/weber/kadron vs. single weber/other)

if you like what you have stick with it, if you can get the FI parts it is
great.

&gt; * hydraulic lifters (yes or no)

YES  that is the one thing that I think is only a plus, there are no
downsides to Hyd lifters that I have ever seen

&gt; * will i lose some topend performance compared to the 1800?

never noticed a difference at the top end, the bottom end now it is very
noticiable

&gt; * know anyone in the Seattle area who does good rebuilds? or anyone I should
&gt; avoid?
sorry I'm on the East Coast, stay away from the crate rebuilders, esp GEX,
but you knew that
