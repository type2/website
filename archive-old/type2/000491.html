Ever felt like you were going in 6 different directions at once. I had
thought out my plan of attack the get my bus on the road with it one-two
weeks. Today the whirlwind started. Got to the bus about 10:am and surveyed
the projects I had started and not completed. Sometimes God has a very
strange sense of humor. For starters I had taken the instrument cluster out
to change the bulbs, add vacuum gauge, and fix the fuel gauge. While it was
out, I decided to install the new turn signal switch I picked up at a swap
meet. I removed the one that was in because of but connections in each wire
and my paranoia. I cut the wires from the old switch about 6/8&quot; back,
installed the wiring harness one wire at a time by removing the short
section and inserting the correct colored wire. Works for me!!! (I hope)

I can't check the wiring because the dash is out and wires are everywhere.
So I go one to installing new seals. I put a hatchback seal in the back.
Best quality and easiest installation of the day. Wolfsberg West was the
very prompt and helpful. One of the seals for the side Windows split and
they sent me another w/o charge or arguments within 5 working days. I order
from them whenever possible.

The front doors of my bus have always hated me. They came apart so easily.
That strange sense of humor is working again. Ordered to complete door kits
from Ron at the bus depot, timely delivery. The first piece to go in is the
outside window scraper. I spent 4 days trying to get it to work right after
reinstalling the innards about a million times. Found of the mfg had
released some defective  scrappers and sent them back to Ron who offered to
replace them when they came in.Waited and waited, called Ron, and waited and
waited so I finally bought them from Wolfsburg West and they fit like a
glove. Any way, I digress. Installing the front door seals took about twice
as long as I had figured, also part of the door kit from BD.

I decided to work on the electrical for a little while, the mechanical for a
little while, and the 1001 and one other little things that kept popping up.
That is why I felt like I was going in 6 different directions at once.

Here is a list of how far I got today,
1.Turn signal switch in (tip-changing the housings of the switches negates
having to remove the steering wheel.

2.New tires installed (already mounted and balanced)

3.Holes drilled for accessory wiring.

4.Door seals, rear hatch seal, engine lid seal replaced.

5.Rear lights and backup lights replaced.

More to come........................................... TBear

Don't take life too seriously- you'll never live through it.
