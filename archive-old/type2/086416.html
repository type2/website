--Corbett,

I have my '79 deluxe sunroof stripped down and am planning to go the same route. I'm familiar with the Bulley website as well.

I started with the foam last week right in front of the rear seat where an &quot;x&quot; cross member lays in front of the exterior sheet metal. The &quot;x&quot; member has comblike fingers that are attached to the exterior sheet metal with a bead of adhesive of somekind. Mine was dried up so I removed, sanded and reattached it with &quot;liquid nail&quot;. 

As for the foam (great stuff by name):

1. It does not &quot;adhere&quot; to the sheet metal, so you need to do the job in layers/stages so the foam can &quot;stack up&quot;.

2. Stay out of the sun. My first mistake. It keeps the foam liquid and makes it run. I did both sides at once (one in the sun) and the cool side looks professional, the hot ran on me and looks like hell.

I plan to find the kool patch and q-pads as well. Please keep me posted on your methods as well

Billy
