Subject: Re: engine #

&gt; i have what i belived to have been a 74' campmobile. i looked up the VIN
&gt; # off the dash, and compared it to #s found at
&gt; http://www.type2_dot_com/bartnik/tech.htm. according to that it is a 75'.
&gt; well that is cool.  i looked up the # engraved on the fan housing above
&gt; the fan fitted to the crankshaft. it was ED018057. the ED after i looked
&gt; it up means it is a 2000 engine. this is fine but i was wondering if fan
&gt; housing from an 1800 or other engine are interchangable. because if so
&gt; the fan hosing could of been off a 2000 engine and the engine it was put
&gt; on (mine) might really be an 1800 engine. suggestions comments??


Yes, the fan housings can be swapped between engines. Never trust the engine
number on it. Find the real number on the case. It is stamped in the flat
section at the base of the square vent box. Looking at the engine from the
rear, look over the top right of the fan housing at the parting line where
it meets the crankcase vent box.
