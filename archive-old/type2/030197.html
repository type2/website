&gt; George,
&gt; 
&gt; I guess my next question will be-----
&gt; 
&gt; Where in the heck are you running your Type 2 bus that creates enough
&gt; abrasive dust to choke off your air filter?

Choking off the filter isn't the problem.  The problem is dust getting
past the filter.  Dirt road travel isn't all that unusual in the western
US.
 
&gt; I wasn't aware that VW created a T-2 syncro, or  Hummer, or 4wd vehicle
&gt; that could compete in the Baja, Barstow to Vegas, or Paris to Dakar,
&gt; competition. 

A baywindow competed in the '68 Baja 1000.  :)

&gt; A K&amp;N filter would be just fine under normal, as designed, intended
&gt; vehicle usage.

The stock filter is even better under normal, as designed, intended
vehicle usage.  That's why the VW engineers put an expensive oil bath
filter on my bus instead of a cheaper oiled gauze filter.
 
&gt; And then, if you wanted to go 4-wheeling, or trail riding, a K&amp;N foam
&gt; pre filter is available, to trap all those microscopic dust elements,
&gt; that may just pass through the K&amp;N (or any other filter) under these
&gt; adverse conditions that you mention.

If the prefilter is fine enough to trap the
small particles, then it will also trap the large particles, rendering the
oiled gauze element only a structural support for the prefilter.

The purpose of a prefilter is to remove coarse particles before they get
to the main filter.  Oiled gauze is pretty good at filtering coarse stuff
already, so what is really needed is a post-filter after the gauze
element!

&gt; One more thought-----
&gt; 
&gt; I work on, and service several Terex TS-14's (scrapers) and yes the
&gt; centrifuge type pre filter helps, but nothing,and I repeat nothing,
&gt; totally stops the dust from entering the engine (especially the rear
&gt; pusher engine) regardless of the filtration used.
&gt; I just thought this was an,terribly unfair picture to paint, as there is
&gt; no way any VW T-2 bus, would ever in it's entire lifetime, ingest the
&gt; amount of abrasives that an off-road earthmoving piece of equipment
&gt; would, or any other off road intended vehicle.

Apples and oranges.  The VW engine isn't as tolerant of dust ingestion as
large Diesel engines with sophisticated filtering systems.  This does not
justify switching the VW to a less effective filtering system!

&gt; The engines life in one of these unit's is good no more than two
&gt; seasons,even with a bi-weekly filter change.

Two years of 8hrs/day use is the same as driving a car 200,000mi, hardly a
poor lifespan.  Obviously the engineers knew what they were doing when
they decided to use a centripetal dual stage filter rather than oiled
gauze for these machines.
 
&gt; Under normal, everyday, driving the K&amp;N filtration system is more than
&gt; adequate.

What is adequate?  When I was racing, adequate was protecting the engine
well enough without clogging to allow me to finish the race.  Oiled gauze
worked very well in this application.  For street use, I consider adequate
to be a filter that passes the minimum amount of particulate.  Hard to
beat the stock filter for this.  Why spend money on a filter that doesn't
filter as well?

The person who started this thread wanted information about he pros and
cons of K&amp;N filters.  Should I keep silent because the information I have
doesn't match the advertising hype?  I'm obviously not going to sway a
die-hard K&amp;N man like yourself, but you aren't the one who asked the
question.
