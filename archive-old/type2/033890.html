I can't speak for the Vanagon but I gained an honest 4hp by swapping a used
but freshly cleaned and oiled K&amp;N filter in place of the paper filter in my
Mustang.  I have been running one for about 60,000 miles now (out of
182,000 total).  I believe it is a good product.  The Mustang's dyno graph
is at the following URL:

I removed the paper air filter completely from my bus for one dyno run, and
it made no difference up until 3200rpm, after which I gained 1-2hp.  The
K&amp;N would probably have shown similar results.  Graph is at the following

Bottom line, I wouldn't hesitate to spend $60 on one.
