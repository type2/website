Subject: Re: [T2] Gel Battery

John:

Optima's are great.  More expensive, but worth the money.  You'll need to get a starter battery (red top) and a deep cycle battery (yellow top).  They're about the same size as any other battery, so they'll fit fine.  If your charging system is working for the 2 batteries you have now, it'll work with the 2 Optima's.  By the way, don't pay retail.  I just bought a yellow top from a place in New Mexico called TNT Distributing.  $127, plus $16 shipping, $143 to my doorstep.  I can get you a phone number if you can't find them on the web.

&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;I have a 1972 VW Camper with a 1979 Interior.  I Have a dual batter setup, with a starting battery from volkswagen, and a cheap deep cycle battery.  Both batteries are getting weak.  I am considering replacing them with Optima batteries.
