Subject: [busalert] 1962 23-window bus stolen in San Jose on 1-20-00

From: bigboost4_at_aol_dot_com (BigBoost4)

My '62 23 window bus was stolen in San Jose on 1-20-00.  It was
two-toned (White on yellow), stock height, had stock wheels, white
overrider front bumper and no rear bumper.  The passenger side rear
corner window was cracked and it had a brown gas door.  The dash
was not cut nor was anything else (wheel wells, etc.).  It was
relatively complete with the exception of a headliner.  Both
front and rear floors were rusty.  It had a new 1776 with a single
weber 40, 96 plate oil cooler, spin on filter, rebuilt trans with
reduction gears, and an alternator.  There were no dents in the
body and the paint was good.  License plate # is DSB724 on a black
plate and the vin # is 903417.  If anyone has any information on
this bus or sees a suspicious new 23 window around please
contact me at 408-932-3129 or the San Jose Police Department.
