Subject: Heater???

I have been trying to get the heater in my 1971 westy to work properly 
without killing me. I have replaced the Heat exchangers, Muffler, Rear engine 
seal, Fresh air hoses, and all of the gaskets and I am still having a problem 
with exhaust fumes entering the passenger compartment. can anyone help me? I 
would appreciate any advise anybody can give me.
Thanks
