&gt; I took the old one off myself and saw that
&gt; staples are the key. What sorta staple gun is required to replace the new
one?

I tried an electric....that was a joke.
I tried a hand power stapler.....that was a joke.
I got an air operated one and got out my compressor....that was the only way
to do it.
Good luck finding those stainless steel staples...I gave up looking and used
regular ones.
