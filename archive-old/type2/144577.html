Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch Release Bearing Failure

&gt; I had two that failed in less than 500 miles... turned out it was not the

&gt; good luck

Thanks, Gail,

Actually now that you mention it, mine may not have been the actual release 
bearing either. The left side spring was snapped when we pulled the engine. I 
thought that the spring had snapped because the bearing seized. I'll have to 
check it out tonight...Maybe it was just a faulty spring?
