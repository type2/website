Subject: Re: [T2] '77 Manual Tranny into '73 Bus

&gt;From: scott lyons sell the known good 77 tranny, take the money and buy a 
&gt;known good 3-rib and
&gt;pocket the extra 2-300 bucks, and save the headaches of making the 6-rib
&gt;fit.

What about the difference between the two? Is one tranny better than the 
other. The reason I ask is that we are going to take out the 1800 and swap 
in a '77 2.0L that is stock and with the '77 tranny.

What kind of head aches are you speaking of? I have not compared the two 
trannies side by side, I do not have the '77 stuff yet. I thought the 
difference was basically the nose cone. Would the be a difference in the 
shifter rod aswell?

BTW the guys name is Marty Lyons, any relation?
