&gt; You'd be surprised sometimes what's available in your area. When I went

I'm sure you're right about this, Richard. In fact, I looked up the URL 
you sent, and you are absolutely right. But in addition to not wanting 
to spend the time, I also don't want to have this conversation, in 
person or on the phone:

Me: Do you carry Loctite THX 118?

Clerk (&quot;associate'): No, we don't carry that.

Me: Know anyone who does?

Clerk: No, I don't. It's not too popular.


Every exchange I have in a store goes like that. Nothing, and I mean 
nothing, that I own or like or use is &quot;popular.&quot; My vehicle isn't 
popular, the engine in it isn't popular, my computers aren't popular, 
the cigarettes I smoke are really unpopular, the bikes I ride aren't 
popular. Nothing I do, think, eat, use, enjoy, consume, or say is 
popular.

I'd rather chew on ground glass than to have another store clerk, 
anywhere, remind me that I live in an alternative (and unpopular) 
universe.
