Subject: Re: [T2] Bilge Blowers

This wasn't going to be used with the gas heater, but instead on the stock
system for when the outside air isn't cold enough to use the gas heater.  I
don't want to wear out the heater when the stock system can be used on
mildly cool days.

&gt; all of the gas heaters I have seen warn about using in line blowers.
&gt; 
&gt; maybe to prevent unburned gasses from being ignited????
&gt; 
&gt; not sure why but I keep seeing this
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I know some of you have tried the bilge blowers out and are impressed with
&gt;&gt; the volume of air they deliver.  I thought I had saved a few of the posts so
&gt;&gt; I could order one and give it a try (I try to be open to new ideas).
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I have a gas heater ready to install, but thought it would be nice to have
&gt;&gt; numerous options for heat for those &quot;marginal&quot; days when I could save the
&gt;&gt; gas heater and use the stock heat with an extra boost.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; But I now cannot find the emails I thought I had saved.  For those of you
&gt;&gt; that have purchased and installed bilge blowers, would you please send me a
&gt;&gt; source for them so I can order one?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Thanks.
