Subject: Brasilia bus revisited

                
hi 

It turns out that the blue and white Brasilia bus I saw in Oxford belongs to
a friend of Phil's (whose computer I am using). He had said it's for sale,
but I don't really think Winnie wants to sell it.  It's his work van for
doing carpentry work.  I think it's a 74, but I don't really understand the
codes on it, so that could be wrong.

Anyway, I ended up tuning up the poor beast yesterday.  It's happier now.
So this is what I saw:

 *  King pin front end.   neat-o
 *  yes, it does have drum brakes all around (which leak)
 *  IRS trans with CV joints 
 *  65-59 style rear bumper, and a front bumper in the same styling made to
fit this bus
 *  popout windows without frames.   the latches go directly onto the glass.
this is different from the one I saw at action.
 *  The engine lid has the flat space above the liscence plate light like
the 58 &amp; earlier, but has the 67 style latch
 *  The forward cargo door latch is the same as on a 67
 *  The rear cargo door latch looks like on a barndoor, but I couldn't see a
part number.  The door was much sturdier and more reinforced than the
barndoor cargo doors.
 *  the window washer button is on the floor, like the high beam switch till
65 (no this bus has the high beam switch on the indicator switch)
 *  hand brake lever is of the split screen style.
 *  heater control knob is on the bit the seat rests on.  it is a pull out,
not rotary.
 *  bench front seat with the spare tire behind it splitty style
 *  wierd paper element air filter attached to the side of the engine
compartment.
 *  I think K profile keys for all the handles, including T and cargo door
handles.  The cargo door handle is shaped in the 55-58 style, but with the
dust cover of the 64 &amp; on cylinder.  odd to see a T handle with that cover.

*  the real question is  are the corner windows and rear hatch glass exactly
the same size as in my '61?  and if so, why can't I get new seals with
molded corners  for my bus? 

sorry, my camera is on the blink, or I would have got someone to take a
picture of me under it.   so you'll just have to take it on faith.
 
now the bus sounds like a bus should, and I think it's a good little workhorse.
