&gt; &gt; If you pushed the clutch to the floor, you WERE able to start the bus,
&gt; &gt; yes?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, but, since it was in Reverse, it lurched backward and died immediately.  I can
&gt; push the clutch pedal to the floor, it doesn't resist, and it does no clutching
&gt; function.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If so, the clutch is NOT the culprit here.  Transmission related.  If you
&gt; &gt; tried to start the bus, and all it did was try to move (ie: clutch did not
&gt; &gt; disengage when pushed...) then I would look at either a frozen clutch
&gt; &gt; plate, or cable problems, etc..
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; another check would be to just push the clutch in. No brake. Nose is
&gt; &gt; downhill, right?  The bus should start rolling.
&gt; 
&gt; No roll.  It used to be that I could sort of feel the clutch pedal resist and then
&gt; like something was engaging.  That doesn't happen now.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; No? But you can start the
&gt; &gt; engine?
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, I can start the engine, but then it instantly dies since it's stuck in
&gt; Reverse.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Tranny.  Cant start the engine? clutch. (or both..)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Uh... poop.  Now I know why Previous Owners are the target of such ridicule.  I
&gt; probably need a new transmission, then?  That's like the cost of just buying a bus
&gt; that works in the first place, right?

Brian:
I think your clutch isn't releasing for one of 2 reasons:
1. Broken clutch cable
2. Broken welds on clutch release shaft.(Pedal moves, cable moves, has
slight resistance because of the spring on the release lever, but
because the throwout bearing is not pushing the clutch fingers in you
don't feel much resistance and the clutch does not disengage.) This is a
lot more work to fix than just the cable because it involves taking out
the engine to get to the shaft, but it's not as bad as fixing the
transmission.
