Subject: Re: [T2] Snow tires...was[T2] re: Tire twist

&gt; There is - it was a pretty rare option. Check your M-code plate for code
&gt; M220. You can also check the tranny code, but the M-codes are the easier
&gt; first start. I'd more than happy to trade your whiny LSD tranny for a
&gt; good non-LSD...

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Is there any chance that this vehicle has got a
&gt; limited-slip??

Pardon my ignorance,  but where might I find this &quot;M-code plate&quot;?  Also, do
you know what code to look for on the tranny (and where)?  Can I have the
LSD unit (if it is indeed such) rebuilt like any other, and can I order an
LSD replacement complete, and from where?  Transform? Good/bad?  TIA for any
help.  I'll check wheel bearings, too, but since the whine is VERY
high-pitched and happens at extremely slow speeds, I think it's tranny.
There's gear noise at higher speeds, too, but it's not bad (I hope) yet.
