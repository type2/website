Subject: Bulkhead fitting pipe length
Message-ID: &lt;0.8d55854e.252e4709_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Hi Jim and all,
I’ve made the &quot;Hoover&quot; type bulkhead fitting about a year ago but replaced 
the stainless tube with a new one cos the old one was starting to cut through 
as it passed through the bulkhead. I kept the original length of pipe that 
extends into the engine bay and joined to the fuel pump with the correct &quot;O&quot; 
clips. I was happier with the s/s tube near the inlet manifold than flexible 
fuel line.
I strongly recommend anyone who has not checked their fuel line - not just 
look at them cos they can appear OK but be very brittle - to do so and 
replace if needed. I guess the bulkhead modification should not be needed if 
the rubber grommet is in place and checked regularly. However, it isn’t easy 
to see there in the back corner. 
I have had no problems with my setup

Watchout if there’s petrol (gas!) about............

&gt;Questions:
&gt;Is there any safety problem replacing the metal pipe length with rubber
&gt;fuel line.  Will there be too much heat for the rubber fuel line.  Has
&gt;anyone successfully fitted the Bob Hoover bulkhead modification and had
&gt;any problems.  Are you out there Bob, could you answer this please as
&gt;I’m concerned about the safety aspect.
