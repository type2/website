Subject: Electrical Delima, No power up front.

No power at the fuse block. Could there be somehting with me cleaning up the 
connections at the starter?

Two spade connectors one fat one small on the solenoid.
Three ring connectors on the post for the starter.

I saw some corrosion on the fuse block so I cleaned all the fuse locations 
and fuses, replace the bad looking ones with new. Still no juice. Where is 
the main power feed coming into the fuse block on a late model bay?

Can I just run a long hot wire from the battery to the fuse block?

The big black wire that is hanging is connected to number 9 or 10 at the 
back side.

In the engine compartment the test block has some misc. small wires and a 
big red and white hanging that are not connected to anything.

The small ones are Brown, Brown/White, and Grey. Would the test block being 
disconnected affect the bus with the problems I am having?

This really sucks. But I am still trying to locate it.
