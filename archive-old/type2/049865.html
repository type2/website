Subject: [T2] No start and BN4 question

Hello hello!

Turned on my van this afternoon only to hear a not too pleasant &quot;click click&quot;
sound.  I have had my van long enough to know that this is probably an
electrical thing (battery maybe?).  How can I tell? What can I do?  I tried it
again just a while ago, but that time I didn't even get any dash lights!

Also... A while ago, my once fine working BN4 gas heater, well... stopped! It
seems to me that the fan itself just stopped, but heat is still possibly being
made... Just no fan.  Again, how can I tell and what can I do?

While I'm at it... any lock de-icing techniques that people have found useful?
I've been using hot water in the mornings... It get's pretty below zero up here
in northern Canada. 

Yepp... that's about it.  Thanks in advance. Happy holiday times! *warm feelings
to you all*

I think there should be something in science called 
the &quot;reindeer effect.&quot; I don't know what it
would be, but I think it'd be good to hear
someone say, &quot;Gentlemen, what we have 
here is a terrifying example of the reindeer 
effect.&quot;
