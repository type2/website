What Jason described is referred to in WA state as &quot;broadform insurance,&quot;
which is what I have used for a number of years.  Essentially it works as he
outlined.  The advantages are that it does indeed save money if you own
several vehicles, or tend (as I did before &quot;Big Boy&quot;) to buy cheap beaters
that wear out fairly quickly.  Also, I found when I purchased my bus, that
because of it's age, it was difficult to get regular comprehensive coverage
at a reasonable price.  Finally, you are insured regardless of what vehicle
you drive, and even whether you are the owner.  The biggest disadvantage is
that broadform only covers one person -- you.  Anyone else driving your
vehicle(s) is not insured nor is the vehicle itself.  So, if you plan to let
others drive it/them, this is probably not a good plan.  Otherwise, it's
great.
