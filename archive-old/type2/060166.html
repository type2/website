Subject: which sealant to use?

The only  oil  leaks I had from the 1776 which I rebuilt last year were
from two of the cylinders where they join the case.  I used 0.040 Berg
spacers in that joint .  I dutifuly followed the instructions that came
with the spacers and coated both side of the spacers with Blue Silicon RTV
sealant.

I am rebuilding that engine yet again this year. Today, I am about to mount
the cylinders and heads and am having second thoughts on the RTV.  I have
read in several of my books/pamphlets that it is not a good idea to use RTV
to seal the case, evidently because the film it leaves is too thick  and
does not allow the case halves to come together enough to seat the crank
and cam bearings properly.   No where in my books does it mention the
possibility of a leak from an RTV-sealed case.

I am having second thoughts about usine RTV though.

Has anyone had experience with leaks from this joint?  Has anyone used a
sealant other than RTV?

Jack
