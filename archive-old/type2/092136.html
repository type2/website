Subject: Re: [T2] leak down test

Jack

I do leak down tests all the time,, I just tested an engine today,, 95% leakdown 
I have tried to remove the rockers, and test the engine with the piston at BDC
so I don't have to hold it from turning,,,, 
No success,

So, I still loosen off the rocker shaft so I know there is lots of play and the
valves are not being held open,, then I do the test at TDC

I think your engine with 48% is bad,,, no matter what temp it is at!

my current engine is at 60% leak down, all rings leakage, and 23 psi compression
on all 4 cylinders,  starts, runs, drives &quot;fine&quot; until I hit that BIG hill,,,,
then .... &quot;2 SLO 2 BAD&quot; is my motto..... :-)

Yes,, that engine is TIRED. I put it together temporarily, with rings that had
0.090 end gap as that is all I had at the time,,,

&gt; &gt; The directions for the gauges mention about leak down values of 92%.
&gt; &gt; The highest I got on any cylinder was 48, and I could hear air
&gt; &gt; hissing inside my case.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The test was performed with the piston at the bottom of the cylinder
&gt; &gt; and the valves closed.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The directions did say to warm the engine to operating  temperatures.
&gt; &gt; I couldn't do this because it was lying on the garage floor awaiting
&gt; &gt; a tear down.  Can my  extremely low numbers be due to the temperature
&gt; &gt; being not correct?
