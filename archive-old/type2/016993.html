&gt; In light of all of the talk lately about &quot;slow&quot; busses and impatient people
&gt; driving behind them in their zippy cars or bigass SUV's, I have a sincere
&gt; question that I would like you older dudes and dudettes to take a stab at.
&gt; Back before '72 (or was it '75) the speed limit was 70 mph, 65 mph at night,
&gt; 65 trucks.  As far as the speed limit goes, it seems as though we have the
&gt; same situation today as we did back then.  What I want to ask is, &quot;What is
&gt; different about people back then as compared to today's folks?  Why is it that
&gt; when I am tooling down the road at 50 - 55 mph I encounter more than my share
&gt; of impatience?  Was it the same back then?&quot;   I'm 38 and don't remember much
&gt; about driving habits of motorists back then and therefore can't compare.  Back
&gt; then there were bookoos of busses and they all apparently lived happily with
&gt; Mopar stuff and the like.  Same speed differential between vehicles as today.
&gt; What is different? Anyone?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!

Hi Paul, hi Volks,

I´m just reading a book about this theme. The German title is :
&quot;Die Kreativität der Langsamkeit&quot; , means &quot;the creativity of
slowliness&quot; .
The author is Fritz Reheis. 
He means, that we are dominated by the rythm of the clocks, not from
natural and traditional rythms. And that we have to get back to them.
It`s very interesting but you can get it only in German. I think there
must be more books about this theme also in English. If anyone of you
knows some, please let me know.

regards
norbert
