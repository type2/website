Subject: Re: [T2] Head interchangeability-(carb to FI) 74-75

&gt;Hey Dave et al, I never had a satisfactory answer to this:  I got a 74
&gt;engine (disassembled by PO who was misled that his 115-125 compression
&gt;was too low) with a free 74 Westy; only 160K mi on bottom end; as the
&gt;heads have a 91 date stamped on them, I assume they were replaced.  How
&gt;can I tell if they are still the stock (1800?) size?

You can measure the valves.  If they are really '74 heads the intake valve will be 41mm across.  There are  also casting numbers but I can't tell you which are which.

&gt; How much of this is
&gt;compatible to a stock 75 engine, should I save it as a spare for my
&gt;daughter's 75 bus?  Is the case is the same?  I'd use the fuel I., not
&gt;the carbs.

The case will work.  You will need a fuel pump blockoff plate if you use it with FI.

&gt;What of the heads- other than needing a hole for the temp sensor, will
&gt;the other FI stuff bolt right up, including the case?

Yes.

&gt;  One head looks
&gt;fine; the other has a small crack running to the base of a seat (intake,
&gt;the large valve)- is this of concern?

Yes, it is.  A crack leading to the seat could cause the seat to come loose at some point.  Not a head I'd want to run in my bus, at least not on any long trips.
