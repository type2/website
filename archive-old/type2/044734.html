Subject: RE: [T2] Side Tents for $399!

&gt; That looks very similar to the Andria tent that Steve Lashley is selling
&gt; for 350.00.


It does bear a cosmetic resemblance, but it is not the same tent.  My
understanding is that the Andria requires a rail or bracing for attachment
to the bus, whereas mine simply has a pole that slips into the rain gutter
(two minutes to connect, with no permanent modification of the bus).  In
this way it is more like Steve's $495 tent, although I suspect that it is
indeed similar to the Andria in other regards.  They're both good tents; I
don't think you could go wrong either way.
