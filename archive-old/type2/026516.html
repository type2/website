&gt;A few Friday's ago I asked how many of you folks illogically believe in
&gt;original instrumentation and how many of you folks are currently 
&gt;driving your bus in need of a repair?  I meant the instrumentation 
&gt;folks who,
&gt;believe aftermarket instrumentation is essential to monitor engine - 33%
&gt;would like to add instruments - 44%
&gt;have aftermarket instruments - 44%
&gt;drive with their ass - 33%

???I must have missed that post - it sounds like a fun survey.  Especially
the question about &quot;driving with your ass&quot;.  

I wonder if there were multiple interpretations of that one.  Such as: 
 - &quot;I drove my boss to lunch today - does that count?&quot; 
 - &quot;If I could only get the door closed with that damn donkey in there....&quot; 
 - &quot;Drive with my ass?  Sure!  I never leave home without it!&quot;
