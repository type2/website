Subject: New wiring diagrams on Thom's page

Thom:

A public thank-you to you and whomever sent you the diagrams!  The only
drawback is that they're huge (600K+)!  I printed the 66+ diagram on an
11x17 sheet and it looks sweet!  I also printed it on 8.5x11 in color and
will probably laminate both and keep them in the bus.

Now just scan in the rest of the early bus Bentley manual and I'll be happy! ;)

Hey, if you don't get the pix of the 67 Rusty up on your buspix page I'll
just have to do one myself!  I can see it now &quot;I don't have a homepage, my
bus does.&quot;
