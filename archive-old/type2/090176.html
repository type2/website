Subject: I can see clearly now!

Woohoo!  Safelite just finished installing a new windshield in my 73 Westy.  
Wow!  When you sit in it it's as if there's nothing in front of you.  $190 
installed at my location (using my existing 4-year old seal).  They warranty it 
for life for leaking/noise.  I wonder what they'll do when I call them in 20 
years and complain that it's leaking....
