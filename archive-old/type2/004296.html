Thank you so much for all of your repsonses.  Can't wait to fully inspect
the problem, and correct it.  However, I do hope it will be solved simply
with appropriate lubrication.  I wonder what the odds are that will be the
case?  100 to 1.  But, for all bus drivers hope springs eternal, right?

You all have provided truly valuable information from the easiest approach
to the far more complex.  I can tackle the job knowing regardless of its
depth, I can handle it.

Thanks again,
Phil

&gt; Folks,
&gt;
&gt; I know this was a topic a week, or so ago, but I have a question and =
&gt; please forgive me if it was already covered.
&gt;
&gt; The slider on my '72 basic bus does not &quot;pop&quot; open when I turn the =
&gt; handle unless I give it a bit of assistance.  I just need to give a =
&gt; gentle pull on the hinge/arm that is exposed on the exterior rear of the =
&gt; door as I turn the handle and it pops right open.  So, what am I =
&gt; missing?  Is there supposed to be a spring?  A roller worn out?  Replace =
&gt; the entire mechanism?  I did notice where one of the catalogues I get is =
&gt; showing a replacement roller for the mechanism, but don't want to get it =
&gt; unless it will solve the problem.
&gt;
&gt; Any help would be greatly appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Phil
&gt;
