Subject: how to hook-up ammeter/voltmeter?

I am getting ready to hook-up an ammeter and two voltmeters
(one per battery).  

What gauge of wire should I use for the voltmeters (which
will be dash mounted)?

The ammeter instructions indicate that it should be hooked-up
in line between the alternator and the battery.  Should I put it
between the alternator and the voltage regulator, or between
the regulator and the battery, or elsewhere?

I plan on using 10ga wire for the ammeter, is this sufficient?
overkill?

Thanks in advance!
