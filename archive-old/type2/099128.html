Subject: Re: [T2] very wierd shifting!

Ok,
That had to be the easiest fix EVER.  I went under the bus and stared at
the joint between the tranny and the shift linkage.  I then noticed that
the set screw was pressing up against the rubber cover.  I pulled the
shifter out of first gear, went back under the car, and rotated the
rubber cover so it fit over the set screw like it's supposed to.

Shifts perfectly now :)

I'll still check the tranny fluid soon.

Thanks,
Mike

&gt; Mike,
&gt; 
&gt; 1st and 3rd, you are &quot;pushing&quot; the shifter into the nose cone in the
&gt; back.  2nd and 4th, you are pulling the whole shifter toward the front of
&gt; the bus.
&gt; 
&gt; My bet is that you have a loose(or failing) coupler bushing or a loose
&gt; set screw somewhere along the linkage.
&gt; 
&gt; Check your trans fluid too!!!
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers ,dave
