Subject: [T2] Squeaky suspension 

Hi guys,
I've got an '82 which has squeaky front suspension. The trouble with that
is, ther is not one grease nipple on the whole van. All the ball joints, tie
rod ends, are supposed to be maintenance free. Is there a way of getting
grease into them?
The last time I had that squeak, it was a beetle, it was because I forgot to
grease the link pins, they froze up and I chopped out two tyres in a single
day.
