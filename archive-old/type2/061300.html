Hi Volks!

Seems I have too much time on my hands... ;-)

Okay... there seems to be demand for this kind of thing, so here's 
what little I know about non-German Transporter versions.

If there is any more information out there, let me know.  I'll keep 
this article updated and put it on my Web site sometime.  Also, if 
any of you have any pictures of these buses, share (but don't send 
them to me without asking first, our mail server is too flaky for 
that).


MEXICO

I don't know much about the beginnings, I expect they made Splitties 
there sometime.  However, the Mexibuses that generate the most 
interest among Listees today are their T2 (Bay) flavour.

Until 1991, they weren't much different from German late model Bays.  
I have a picture that shows different bumpers, not unlike those of 
the early Vanagon.  This still is a real T2 though.

&gt;From 1991-96, Mexico made the Bay with an inline four cylinder 
watercooled gasoline engine.  These Transporters can be spotted by 
their huge black radiator grille up front.  At least the later years 
sported plastic bumpers that went all the way around the corners to 
the wheelarcs.  Another characteristic of these is the slightly 
raised plastic roof with sharper corners.  We might want to call this 
a T2.5, but I've never heard this before.

Since 1996, Bays aren't being produced in Mexico anymore, but the 
Brazil plant is said to produce the inline-water engined version for 
the Mexican market.  I have not been able to confirm this.

BRAZIL

The Splitty (T1) was made in Brazil until 1975.  While the Brazilian 
ones are quite different from the German ones in detail, they still 
qualify as T1.  I think they have many specifics that disappeared 
from the German models much earlier, like Barndoor-ish cargo doors or 
the narrow rear hatch.  What we know as a &quot;15-window&quot; or a &quot;hardtop 
deluxe&quot; may well have been standard there -- at least it seems to be 
the commonest passenger version in Brazil.

&gt;From 1975, Brazil produced what surely qualifies as the oddest VW 
Transporter of all: the infamous T1.5 (T-one-and-a-half).  This is a 
Splitty in dimension and construction, but features a nose panel, 
windshield, and front doors very similar to those of the Bay (T2), 
hence T1.5.  The Bus versions look oddest -- imagine a 15-window 
Splitty with corner windows and a Bay front end and taillights.

Rumour has it that these beasts were even available with watercooled 
inline-four Diesel engines in the mid-Eighties, but I was not able to 
confirm this.  What I can confirm is that at least some of them had 
independant rear suspension and trannies not unlike those of the 
Super Beetle.  My sources contradict each other in many points, or 
maybe they just changed the design frequently.

Production of the T1.5 is said to have been halted in 1996.  Instead, 
the T2 is being made there to this day.  More on the Brazilian T2 
below; I have not been able to confirm the production of T2 pickups 
in Brazil, so maybe, just maybe, the T1.5 pickups are still being 
made there?

T1.5 web site copy, and T1.5 brochure scans, soon to appear on my 
site.  Sorry for the delay.

The Brazilian Bay (T2) is a little oddballish too.  It features the 
plastic roof that the late Mexican Bays had, but unlike them has an 
aircooled Type 1 engine.  The bumpers are sized like those of the 
late German Bay (1973-79) but shaped like those of the Splitty and 
early German Bay (1968-72).  The front cab doors are those of the 
T1.5 in that they have an additional line pressed into them that 
follows the lower door edge -- maybe to keep dirt off the doors?  I 
think we still ought to call this a T2, though; the changes aren't 
that dramatic.

SOUTH AFRICA

What little I know can be just as well read on VWoSA's web site.  
Short abstract: Vanagons that look like late German ones, but with 
inline 4-cyl and 5-cyl engines instead of the wasserboxers.  Still, I 
don't think they're T3.5 or such -- it's really just the engines, and 
there were inline engines in German ones too (albeit Diesels).

Bay, here's an overview:

&gt; T1.5 (Brazillian) I have a nice ca.1981 brochure I bought from Uncle
&gt; Jerry that shows these including a red and white Deluxe and a wide bed 
&gt; single cab
&gt; T2.5 (Mexibuses)
&gt; T3.5 (South African) I'm just speculating on the .5 but they are quite a
&gt; bit different with 5 cylinder motors and other strange and wonderful
&gt; (modern) features

Yours,
