Subject: non stock oil pump

I bought a 1600DP sight unseen, hoping to stick it into my '71 Westy and
get it on the road for the first time since last March.

First thing I notice is a big Fram oil filter attached to a special oil
pump cover and coming horizontally out from the cover.  Sure enough, it
interferes with the mustache brace that bolts onto the rear of the engine.
So my hope for a drop-in replacement engine is not to be.

OK, I'll just remove the filter/pump cover, slap on a stock pump cover and
still be on the road by suppertime.

I removed the pulley and removed the oil pump cover.  Another show stopper.

The pump is not a stock pump and I can't just install a stock cover plate.
The gears are about 50% longer than stock gears. The gears ride on shafts
that poke into the cover for extra support, I guess. And finally, I haven't
bee able to remove the gear that engages the camt. I've grabbed it with
pliers but it won't come out.


So..........  My questions.

1. Just to satisfy my curiosity, what is this pump/filter/cover plate that
I have? It's not full flow.  Obviously, the filter is not just an add on to
a stock pump. It must be sold as an assembly?

2. Can I remove this oil pump and simply substitute a stock pump?

3. Can I do this without splitting the case?

4. I have the oil pump puller tool but unless I get that gear out, the tool
has nothing to grab. Any suggestions here?

Jack
