I am posting this only because Bob Hoover, in his sermon on cleaning 
steel parts, invited testimonials.

I picked up 5 lbs. of TSP and an enamel pot the other day; yesterday I 
used a pound of the stuff and about a gallon of water on the stove. This 
degreased seven smaller pieces of tin and four pushrod tubes, and removed 
all the paint. 

I wish I had known about this stuff when I did earlier, non-VW 
restorations. It's terrific, and it saved me hours and much messiness.

Some notes: 

1. The box says &quot;trisodium phosphate&quot; on it; I got it at a hardware 
store. There are containers of stuff called TSP that say &quot;contains no 
trisodium phosphate.&quot; Don't bother with that stuff.

2. After about ten to a dozen pieces, the broth will build up a layer of 
scum on top. If you can't tuck a piece all the way into the pot, this 
will form a ring on the piece. At this point, you've entered the area of 
diminishing returns. Dump it and make a new batch. Or at least skim the foam.

3. Disposal is the downside of TSP. I tossed it down the toilet, flush 
thrice, and rationalized that this small amount of chemistry saved the 
world from the unnecessary construction of one SUV.

4. Don't use it on aluminum. For aluminum, stick with Simple Green.
