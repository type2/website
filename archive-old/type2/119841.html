Subject: Re: [T2] sticker

&gt; I don't know when 
&gt; VW went to a sticker/decal although I am aware they
&gt; did go that route.

I think the sticker was introduced with modelyear
1971, but I am not 100% sure. I don't think I ever saw
a stock 1971 bus with the old type of labeling.

&gt; At 
&gt; present I am having a local sreening company &quot;redo&quot;
&gt; three column supports.

What is 'screening' exactly? Sorry, but English is not
my native language. Is it that they sort of
spray-paint the writings on the steering column again?
