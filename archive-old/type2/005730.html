&gt;&gt;  from &quot;Volkswagens of the World&quot; (Simon Glen) ISBN 1-901295-61-3: there
was a 1980 - 1983 VW Gol in Brazil (looks similar in size and shape as a Fox
or the early Polo; described in the book as a mix between Golf and Scirocco
but somewhat smaller) which had a front engine and was aircooled...  &lt;&lt;
