&gt; Hi there, Matilda (71 Westy) just got Kadron 40 mmdual carbs, compufire

&gt; retarded and she would hesitate like crazy.  Now she starts great, and runs

whoa.  You dont mention whether this is a stock engine or not....With dual
40's, i'd seriously hope you are not still running a 1600cc engine!

If you ARE, you are tremendously overcarborated.  You need to get smaller
venturi's, and rejet.  If you're running a bigger engine, then I dont
know.;)

good luck...david
