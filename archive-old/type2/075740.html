Subject: spare tire and bus jack

Hi Volks,
I recently bought a great '78 Westy. I took my first
longish trip over the holiday weekend. Mid-way through
the trip I realized that I didn't have a tire jack in-
case I got a flat! Great spare but no jack!
Fortunately, I didn't need it but... If anyone out
there has a bus jack they can part with cheap...
please let me know - I sure would like to buy it and
carry it!
ALSO... Spare tire cover...I have the nose mounted
arrangement but the cover is wasted. I want to replace
the cover. I figured I would cut a round piece of
plywood and glue it to the inside of a new black vinyl
cover and then mount the VW emblem back on. I believe
that I did this way back in the early '80s on another
bus I owned. Anyone have a source for the black vinyl 
tire cover?? It would be cool to find one with a VW
emblem printed on already!
Thanks all!
