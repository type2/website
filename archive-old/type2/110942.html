&gt; i have seen that article. except for the huge goopy mess he put all over the
&gt; gaskets, it is a good idea. some 411 and 914 heads have venting in the head
&gt; already, not sure why it was not used on the bus.

I'm not a big fan of venting the valve covers.  Seeing as how they are
already vented through four big pushrod tubes it really isn't needed
unless you happen to autocross your bus and push the oil around in the
sump.  If you must vent the rocker area, better to do it through the head
so that you don't have to disconnect a hose to pull the cover.
