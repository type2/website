 &gt; As usual, the answer is to install a booster relay back near the
 &gt; starter.  The major difference between the instructions you've gotten
 &gt; so far and what you'll need to do is that you need to find a relay
 &gt; that operates when given between five and six volts, instead of one
 &gt; that wants eight to twelve volts.  You might want to wander through a
 &gt; farm implements (i.e., tractors) supply place to see what they have
 &gt; along those lines.  Electronics surplus stores are good too.  There
 &gt; are lots of five volt relays out there, but most of them won't handle
 &gt; the sort of current you need to run (how many?  not sure, but probably
 &gt; around a hundred).

The previous owner installed a 6V relay to assist in getting current
to the solenoid; it didn't help him. I removed it, thinking perhaps it
was horked, and no change in the starting problem.

If I'm not mistaken, the relay helps the solenoid engage. My solenoid
has no problem engaging, but the starter does not turn quickly enough.
In fact, even if the engine is hot so that the starter barely turns
one quarter revolution before stalling, the solenoid engages with a
satisfying thunk.

This bus has had this problem for over 15 years... (I've owned it for 5).
I've replaced nearly every electrical part.
