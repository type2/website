Subject: Knock knock......One More Time
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Greetings to the List,

And my thanks to Sean, Al, Greg, Allen, Don, and Andy for their replies to my 
first Knock knock posting.  Guys, I am going to check the torque on those 
rear wheel nuts.  But, assuming the worst, and the CVs do need a little TLC, 
do you have any tips or tricks in dealing with these little monsters?  I'm 
spending my free time getting educated and reading Haynes, Bentley, and Muir 
(I've never tackled CVs before) but I'm wondering if any of you have 
&quot;special&quot; advice for a first-timer on this job.  I'm thinking I should be 
looking for scoring like on bearings...........what else?

Al, you mentioned switching the CVs.  How exactly does one switch them 
around?  Is that kinda like rotating tires - a special pattern involved?  Any 
particular grease recommended?  Any particular replacement boot?

Thanks guys.  With a little help and moral support I just might be able to 
get through this little job.

Mike
