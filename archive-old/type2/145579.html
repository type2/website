Subject: Re: [T2] Where to buy fuel line clamp

OK - for anyone else who is having problems with the fuel clamps:

I called the number on the website (206.227.7355), and spoke to
Christopher Goodwin himself. Apparently, Christopher Goodwin Tools has
not been around for a couple of years. He is now Christopher Goodwin
Motorsports, and seemed surprised that the website was still up and
running. (I noted, however, that he didn't ask for the URL or any other
details so that he could investigate further)

Anyway, he took my name and said he'd refund the money on paypal. We'll
see...

I placed an order and paid paypal.  Haven't heard a thing in response.

&gt; I had passed this online seller's info to the list a while back.
&gt; Beware, I'm having trouble with them
