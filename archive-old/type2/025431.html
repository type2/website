I have run across three 1968 buses with original paint colors that I have
not seen before.

Bus#1 left the factory as a deluxe bus, was sold as a tourist delivery
vehicle and was eventually converted into an Adventure-Wagen. The original
color was a light, pale, yellowish color from the rain gutter down with a
pastel white roof. The interior was all black. Bus is currently on the raod

Bus#2 Was sold by a dealership in Goldsboro, NC. I has the same color scheme
as the bus listed above but still in the deluxe 7 passenger format. The bus
is  for sale.

Bus#3 Is resting peacefully in a junkyard out in the county. It is a Sunroof
deluxe. The paint scheme is a goldish color and appears original. It is
painted pastel white from the waistline up I have seen one other early bay
with the same paint scheme but do not recall if it is a 1968,1969 or 1970.
The interior of this bus is rather exciting. It is red! All seats and panels
as well as things like bolsters, window cranks and door pulls are red.
Although it is too rough to save it appears that it would have looked
beautiful when new.

Does anyone know the correct paint names and codes for these colors? Has
anyone ever seen an early bay with a red interior? If you have pics of any
of these exterior colors or an original red interior, please send them to
me.
