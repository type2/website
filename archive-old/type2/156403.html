Subject: [T2] Distributor Problems?

&gt; i have placed cylinder one  at  &quot;top dead
center&quot;   as i mean the  cylinder  is at the top
of the compression stroke at clinder
one.   i have the distributor in place and the
points gapped correctly and
allof my wires are connected and they are
connected to the correct spark
plug.  when i out the rotor button on, it should
line up with the notch, but
it doesnt.   it  is 90 degrees away, what should
i do?  

009 dizzy is 90 degrees out, as you have noted. 
Put the #1 wire in the spot where the rotor is
pointed and then 4-3-2 clockwise.  Once she's
running, set the timing at about 28 degrees max. 
There are more instructions in the T2 library.
