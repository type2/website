There is a resistor in series with the solenoid that has been known to 
increase in value over time. You should measure less than 60 ohms from pin 
86b to pin 65. (I know you tried a second double relay measure it too).

Your meter may be reading the average voltage of the chopped waveform 
supplied from the relay to the pump (6V if its a square wave). You would 
read low depending on the duty cycle of the relay chopping.  The voltage 
would be low with the pump hooked up or disconnected and could have little 
to do with the resistance of the relay to pump wire.
