Subject: Re: [T2] Sorry for the previous post.

Since it's Friday on the east coast,

Gail, your penance shall be: sell that new VW and buy an old type 2.

&lt;satire on&gt;

Type 2 headlights are particularly easy to change; every screw is 
exposed and the whole thing is pretty self explanatory if you can 
recognize the difference between a phillips and a flat. In the time you 
took to find out how to change the bulb, several of us have talked about 
various ways of fixing things that aren't broke, breaking things that 
only needed fixing, obsolete part numbers, and esoteric differences in 
the size of the head of a bolt that is so rusty it's original size can 
only be guessed by the person who can actually see it, while the rest of 
us try to guess. All while we are doing nothing other than looking at 
our computer monitors and tapping little things called &quot;keys&quot; that look 
nothing like something that will unlock a door (which, surprisingly, the 
often do). Meanwhile, none of us has done so much as change a light bulb 
(which we all know takes at least 243 of us).

Welcome to the type 2 list. I genuinely hope we can positively influence 
you (you will be assimilated if you do not unsubscribe) to get an 
aircooled bus.
