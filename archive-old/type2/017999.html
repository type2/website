    I was just looking at that TurboCity site someone just posted and
was wondering how that would work with the FI. Would the fuel mixture
get enriched by the increased airflow running thru the airflow meter or
would you have to make some additional modification?
     I know on the turbo diesels there a different fuel pump for the
turbo, to provide fuel enrichment.
