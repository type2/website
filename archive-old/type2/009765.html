&gt;1.) Although i am very happy with my 71 westy, i would love for it to have 
&gt;the upper binks found on the late models (74 and later?) is there anyway to 
&gt;retro fit this, if i get one from a parts car? If so, what do I need to be 
&gt;sure to get to make it work (hardware, etc.)?

A less invasive alternative to the more involved job of swapping in a later
poptop/roof can be found in the Library:

Mike Benthin posted that awhile back.  If anyone has a '68-'73 Westy with
the foam poptop bed that Mike describes, please contact me.  I'd like to add
actual photos of such a setup to the Type2 Library.
