Subject: RE: [T2] read side marker light source?

To All,

I do enjoy writing &quot;fables&quot; and the like, but I'll clear up this one.

My mistake, the &quot;China&quot; script is cast into the white(ish) plastic of the
lens housing, not the lens itself. 

Next time I start to care, I'll photograph it. But I have to warn all of you
I only have 600 speed black and white film and shoot with a 2000x telephoto
lens; so it may look like a plesiosaur. In fact now that I think of it,
maybe the casting said &quot;Made in Scotland&quot;...

They are of strange quality than really poor quality (I have received some
much worse stuff over the years). I have 6 sets of lenses (don't ask me why)
and I broke 2 of them drilling out the &quot;clips&quot;. All of the bases vary in
finish and shape. The foam-like seals were all crappy, but the lenses were
acceptable and are all shiny and reflecty[sic] which probably matters most.

If you mix and match your old parts with the new lenses, you might be happy.

Jon Stiles
