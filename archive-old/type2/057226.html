Subject: New 1.8 in 73 Westy

I just had a rebuilt 1.8 put in my westy. It was running okay, but some backfire (more like a sputter) on downshifts. Also dieseling after shutdown. It's running dual mini-webbers. Checked all exhaust connections took it back to mechanic that installed/tuned it. He rejetted the carbs, but still sputter and still dieseling. Any suggestions? (Fuel/air mixture was also set by mechanic)

I lost some faith in this mechanic when, in place of what I believe is  supposed to be a cooling flap (A hole in the tin that runs underneath near the oil cooler) I found A COKE CAN CUT AND PAINTED BLACK TO MATCH THE TIN. I don't know, I spent a lot of money for this engine and could really use any help you guys can give me.

Thanks in advance,

George
