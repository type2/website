You need to specifically request a LOW pressure fuel pump. The FI system
requires ~30 psi, and a carb requires ~5 psi.  When you request a fuel pump
you will need to tell the parts jockey that his computer data only applies to
fuel injected engines, and that you do not have fuel injection, so therefore
you do not need the pump listed in the computer.  That will of course send
him into a brain fart, and you will need to speak to someone else.

Well now, that tears it.  I hooked up the pump from
the Goose (fuel injection pump) on the Swan (Weber
carb converted). OOPS.  Guess the pressure was too
high.  I had asked the &quot;nice young man&quot; at the
specialty VW shop (will remain nameless), who had
said that it would not matter, that a fuel pump was
a fuel pump, and that he didn't have time to
discuss it.  Should have listened to the voice in
the back of my head.  GAS CAME OUT OF THE AIR
CLEANER.  I hope it came through relief valves, not
rupture disks, cracks or in other unpleasant ways.

I bet someone out there knows just the type of
electric fuel pump is required for a carbureted '75
bus engine.  (If the parts store guys respond, I
think I'll wait for corroborating testimony.)
