The rust monster has chewed this one up pretty bad before spitting it out. No
motor, or tranny. Bed, belly box, gates, rear corners, and belly covers are
rusted bad. Some items are easy to fix (bed and belly box) but not with stock
replacement parts.

QUESTION IS: should I get it... or pass on it. What (besides the
aforementioned items) should I pay attention to. And look at before accepting
the offer ???

(getting in over my head)(but would like to save it from the crusher)
