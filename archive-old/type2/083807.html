Subject: tubes in tubeless tires

Hello friends,
thanks to all those who have helped me so far with my
69'
when i bought the bus it had old german rubber on it
with tubes. i took the bus to a tire place with 4 good
steel belted tubeless tires on other rims. (not wide
5s.)  i asked the tire guy to switch the good rubber
onto the wide 5s.  he did but he put the tubes inside
them.  now i have tubes in tubeless tires.  is this a
problem????  i plan to go back to the guy and i need
to know why it's a problem because he's full of sh_at_##*
and very unprofessional

thanks again 

mickthe  at the tire place that i took it to put the
tubes i
