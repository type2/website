I have a 72 bus for sale located in Aiken SouthCarolina.
 It is some what ugly due to a faded and peeling repaint but the body is in
Excelent shape.it mostly rot free but there is some in the lower doglegs and
on the cab floor. It has a 2litre motor with a weber progressive. it ran
great 3 years ago when it was to have the rear brakes replaced , it still
needs the rear brakes done. It will need a little fiddling with but would be
a great driver. It has both bumpers but has no interior in the cargo area.
I need to get rid of this van because i dont live in SC and i have to many
cars as it is.            asking $600 firm

thanks--------- Bryan      innes_at_clickcom_dot_com
