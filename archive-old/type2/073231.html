&gt;&gt; while most of you would probably rebuild yourself, i have no such luxury.
&gt;&gt; i am severely constricted by time and money and *must* put a new longblock
&gt;&gt; in my '68 Campmobile.
&gt;
&gt;I've made that mistake and it cost me plenty.  rent a car, take the
&gt;transit bus, hitchike, but take the time to do it right

Yeah, Sol, I have to second that. You know what's best for you but I have
to tell you that every time somebody who is a mechanical novice gets
himself into one of these deadline situations it ends in misery and defeat.

You aren't the first to come to the list with a situation like this. It's
your movie, but I'm asking you to please re-consider your premises. Perhaps
a used motorcycle could get you through the short-term while you take the
time to learn more?
