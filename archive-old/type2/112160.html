I really doubt this is the issue, but when my 79 started acting up, it
would miss at a particular load area. close to the same rpms but not
exactly. As it turns out the afm track was so worn at one location
that depending on certain conditions it would miss sometimes.

you could try to put an vom across the terms on the amf that are on
either end of the sliding connection. then take a pencil and move the
flapper and see if anyplace goes to an open circuit? easy to try at
least.
