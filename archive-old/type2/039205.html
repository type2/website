Subject: Dellorto Carb's...advice needed

I'm slowly getting my '72 bus back together after a
top end rebuild.  

I'm wanting to know if my carbs need attention or if I
should just bolt them back on.

Looking at the dellorto handbook is somewhat
confusing.   Though very helpful, It's kind of like a
paragraph that goes on for 112 pages. I was hoping
someone with some dellorto experience might be able to
dial me in a bit.

The carbs are probably fairly old and seem to be
working o.k., but the linkage was always falling out
of adjustment.  When it gets real cold, one side wants
to stay open about 30% even at idle. Maybe the
throttle spindle hardware just needs to be lubed. 
(with what?  WD-40 didn't help much)

Prior to rebuilding, cylinder 4 had low compression,
which I suppose could possibly indicate a carb problem
(e.g. running lean).  

The linkage has been so unreliable that I've been
tempted to not even bother balancing them with a
unisyn.  (I need to buy one)  Usually within one
fill-up I can open one side or the other a good 1/8&quot;
at the throttle adjustment screw before the other
throttle moves.  The engine will increase several
hundred rpm's, maybe 1,000.  Would this mean that the
closed-throttle side is necessarily running lean (and
hot,unbalanced, etc.?).  

Should I tamper with the carbs or just throw them back
in and be greatful they're not broken yet?  I thought
it might be a good idea to blow out the jets, but
don't have reason to believe they're blocked.  Would I
have to open them up(carbs) to do that?  If opening
them is at all risky, I'd rather not right now.  I'm
trying to get my bus on the road. I will probably
check/adjust the jet and mixture screws by ear as a
minimum.  

Thanks much,

Shawn
