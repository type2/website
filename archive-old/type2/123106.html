&gt; &gt;check the color of the plugs.
&gt; what plugs the spark plugs or the Temp. plugs I have read about? Where

spark plugs

&gt; &gt;What kind of fuel setup do you have? Dual carb? Single Carb?
&gt; 
&gt; It is a single Weber. No Vacuum though. One main hose of the the intake 
&gt; manifold I assume it goes to the tranny, but have not gone that far yet. 
&gt; This is the first 2.0L that I have ever played with.

ok it should be a Fuel injected.
you should have at least one vacuum line to the brake booster,  the 77auto
tranny is centrifugal advance and doesn't have a vacuum line. (ignore
this section of the Bentley)

&gt; Is it better to have a Vac. Advance or Centrifugal? I am not sure what is in 

stock is a combo of both Vac/centrifugal, there is a page in the library
that lists all the dist.  Steve is the Dist guru and he is temp off list.

&gt; That would be for a '77 FI Automatic Trans.(currently it is the Single 
&gt; Weber). Will the proper one work with both applications FI and Carbureted

I would search high and low and put the Fuel Injection back in, the auto
tranny doesn't work worth beans with the carb.  they get in each others
way it seems.
