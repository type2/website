I seem to recall seeing a California label on their bus when they were 
here a few weeks ago.
In fact, now that I think about it, I am sure I remember making comment 
on the bus having California pollution crap added to it's configuration.

BTW Dave,
Did Gayle and Richard comment on how well or lack of well their battery 
was doing for them, and are they able to start the bus with full 
cranking power on a consistent basis?
