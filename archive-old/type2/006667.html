David,
I wouldn't call it karma... that's just a rip off from the old biblical
maxim... &quot;what you sow, is what you reap&quot;... I tend to be generous as well,
and most people I deal with are generous with me...in spite of what their
original intentions were! So please don't lose your faith in human nature...

I intend to put a bunch of deep cycle batteries (12 volt) into my 75 bus...
any comments? Also I want to put solar panels on the roof... recently I saw
a mention of this on the list. Can some *generous* person direct me to the
link?

GK

&quot;Oh, money is not important... it just ranks 2nd to oxygen!&quot; Rita Davenport

Subject: Karma and parts


| Yes, I know, it would be great if we could all just give up all
| extraneous possessions, and always be able to find what we need along
| our path of life.
|
| REALITY ALERT!
|
| I just spent $7000 resurrecting my '76 Type two. I still need many
| parts, and have some extra around. Recently I talked with a member of
| this list, and sent him a brake vaccuum unit I had to go tear off of a
| junked car. I spent 1.5 hours taking it off, and $9.50 to send it to
| him. So far I have gotten squat back except thank yous and promises of
| the shipping costs in the mail.
|
| I sent it with hopes of 'good karma' and being part of the 'bus
| brotherhood' but have only received feeling like a used idiot in return.
| I know this is probably only an isolated incident, but it shapes my
| future actions. Hell, I got my bus from a past list member, and he had
| no problem concealing the problems with this bus so he could sell it.
|
| So I would not call it profiteering so much, as just not being an open
| headed idiot. I wish I was wrong, and will continue to deal with ppl in
| as open and trusting a way as I can, but I am afraid we live in a
| material world, and most ppl mistake kindness for weakness, and take
| whatever advantage they can.
