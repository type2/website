Subject: time to heat... (missing prts:(
Message-ID: &lt;000201bf2d39$ef90e720$e330fea9_at_USER&gt;

Hopefully Ron can help me out with this....
On a &quot;PRELIMINARY&quot; inspection I noticed( my first winter with blue) that I
am missing the two warm air hoses from the blower (4.95 each at BUS DEPOT)
and the Part, i wanna say the warm air flaps, from the 1st heat exchanger to
the 2nd heat exchanger.
#1 in my haynes there is no difference in names for these two completely
diff. looking components(heat   exchangers)
#2 I cant find the connecting part called a warm air flap in haynes on bus
depot (ron?)
thats all. Im also missing the control knob to turn on the blower. for some
reason though thats the last thing Ill deal with. (big things first) I now
have a helluva lot of &quot;cloth&quot; shoved up my heat exchangers(not my doing.
curse that po) So im &quot;assuming&quot; the blower at once did work and am just
concerned about getting all my heating elements in good order.
thnx in advance!
also dont forget to start thinking about draining those water tanks b4 the
FREEZE sets in.
