Subject: RE: [T2] Cyl Head temperature Sensors

Mine was a little tight last time. I used some antisieze when I installed
the new one. Try using a torque wrench to remove it. If it takes a lot of
torque without moving, stop! (I never found a spec, but assumed similar to
spark plugs)  Then maybe run the engine to get it hot. Things usually
(depending on material) come apart more readily hot than cold. DON'T
re-install while hot; let cool all the way down first(couple hours).

&lt;SNIP&gt;
On the subject of temp. senders, how difficult is it to remove the FI Head
temp sender?  I've never changed this, and have owned my bus since 1989.  I
am worried it is stuck in the head, and will booger the hole when I try to
get it out. Any tips??
