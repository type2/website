&gt;       Good Grief! Are you stone nuts?  If you really need an
immediate, easy
&gt; to obtain, freeze-proofing for a drinking water tank, use vodka or
gin.


Hmmm...well, that's not such good advice either. I once made a batch
of long-island mix in my water tank (recipe: one bottle each; vodka,
gin, white rum, tequila and sweet&amp;sour mix...add some ice and a splash
of Coke and you've got a party!) and even though it was consumed
quickly, it actually softened the plastic filler tube for the tank!!!

I have not used the tank for drinking water since, but I think the
softening plastic will probably impart some nasty flavor. I guess I'll
have to replace it. It was actually brand new at the time :-(, but I
guess the overall effect was worth it.

Now before anyone suits up to flame me; I do not condone drinking and
driving. I did this for a party.

Was it worth it? Hell yes!!! How many times do you see long islands 
come out of a tap in a bus?! I guess I'll save the current &quot;melted&quot;
filler tube for the next  I make them and get a new one for camping.

Did I mention adding the juice from 4 limes to the mix?!
