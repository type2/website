Subject: 81 fuel pump

I replaced the fuel pump yesterday which had become very audible. No sense in
risking a distant breakdown wondering how far the old one would last. Rebuilt
was $100 with a $35 core charge refunded the next day. Also replaced the in
line filter, which had clearly been doing it's job for a long time, and the
fuel line which was so cracked it had to be original. All's quiet again.
