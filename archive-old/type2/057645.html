 Hi All.
My dad borrowed the 73 Westy yesterday and drove home (about 80 miles).
He parked the bus and then came back to see fuel pouring out the drain hose
off the fuel pump.(73 type4 motor,stock)
I was wondering if anyone knows the problem?
I was thinking either a ruptured pump diaphram or maybe a float valve stuck?
I told him to pull the pump and disassemble to check.Also to wrap the float
bowls to see if that helps.
Any suggestions?
Thanks.Please P mail as I haven't received the digest in a week!(problems?)
