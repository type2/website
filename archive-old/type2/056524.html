I hope that at first it cranked enough to get oil pumped up everywhere
in the system... I was trying to get a &quot;rebuilt&quot; started earlier this
year, but a mysterious endplay problem created much resistance that
&quot;wiped&quot; my bearings. The worst affected were the rod bearings. The mains
came in a close second. The wrist pin bushings were alright somehow.
	I've been taking my time putting it back together. It seems like I
learn something new every time I rebuild one... and with my bus
inventory changing so much in the past several years, my curiosity
hasn't let me go without tearing each and every engine down to make sure
the insides are ok.
	But... I cranked that engine more than I should have, and it was a good
thing that I disassembled it to inspect, for the damage was great. i
kind of had a feeling that it would be that way. I hope you don't have
that feeling...
