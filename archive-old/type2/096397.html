Subject: timing question

Hi all, I recently finished a top-end rebuild and am ironing out the rough
edges.  I ended up taking the bus to a mechanic who (among other things)
replaced the distributor, saying something to the effect that the timing
wouldn't hold.  He also said that the bus &quot;wanted to be timed&quot; at 7.5deg
BTDC instead of the standard 5deg ATDC.  This was what he saw from the gas
analysis: the combustion was happening best (most completely) at the
former timing spec.  The mechanic, however, set the timing to 5deg ATDC in
order for the vehicle to get smogged (and the bus ran like absolute crap,
with barely any power to speak of).

My question is: why is 7.5deg BTDC best for my vehicle?  Bentley and the
sticker on the engine compartment lid both say 5ATDC...  Sure enough, the
bus runs great at 7.5.  How is anyone without a gas analyzer supposed to
know what timing setting is best?  I always thought I'd be fine if I went
by the book.  Also, is this likely to change ever?  Can I always set the
timing at 7.5BTDC from now on?
