I'm looking for a Weber 32/36 DFEV kit for my 2.0 Type IVthat I use as a =
daily driver. I know alot of you will tell me to &quot;put on the injection&quot; =
but that is not cost effective to buy all the parts for this. This has =
always had carbs. I'd appreciate leads to a place with a good price on =
the appropriate kit.(manifold, choke, linkage, etc) Ran Dual 36's and =
40's. Tired of the problems and work. NEED simplicity.Thag want single =
carb!
