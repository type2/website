&gt;My 73 Westy has been running hot since buying it two

&gt;Maine, I was hitting my usual 250 temps on the highway.  This is what
&gt;I have:  Twin Solex carbs, 87 Octane, Speed 60-63 mph, 10w-30 oil,
&gt;70F outside temp, 36-40 degree BTDC _at_ 3000 RPM's, 115 psi in all four
&gt;cylinders.  40-45 psi oil pressure at 60 mph/250F.

The oil psi sounds way high relevant to the type of oil you are using and
it's supposed temperature.  10W30 oil at 250 degrees should give you more
like 25 psi at 60 mph, if that.  20W50 oil at 210 degrees is what's needed
to get 40 psi at 60 mph in my bus, and it's a tight engine.

Based on everything you said, it sounds like your oil temperature reading
is wrong.  I know you said you checked it, but that's still my guess.  If
your oil is hitting 250 you would probably be able to smell it getting
singed, as well as be able to feel the extreme heat radiating from your
engine after it is shut off.  That's my zwei pfennig...
