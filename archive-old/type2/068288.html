Subject: Exhaust in cab/push rod seals

        Chip,
        Just my $0.02- FIX THE EXHAUST LEAK NOW!! PLEASE!!
        Everything else doesn't matter if you're dead. If the CO
makes you foolish, the accident could kill you, or hurt your bus.
Sorry to be such an alarmist, but really, you're worth it.

        The push-rod seals are two different sizes not always
differnt colors.- big end out, little end in. Make sure they give 
you both sizes. I think I used the 'high temp Viton' purple/brown colored 
ones the time I did this. Be sure to clean the pushrod tubes and 
surrounding area THOROUGHLY (Brush and hand-cleaner, then rinse &amp; dry) 
before removing the pushrod tube- since you'll be pulling it through 
the head, you don't want crud falling off it into the head OR into
the case when you remove it... Remember how the wire bail goes before
you pull it out after you slack off the rockers.

        Good luck!
        Bill
