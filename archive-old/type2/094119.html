&gt; Thanks Karl ! I will get back to you on that . The reasons that you listed
&gt; are why I want to change to electronic ignition . Also sustained high RPMs
&gt; breaks points down easily . I need to rebuild my motor , it has over 100,000
&gt; miles on it and it has developed an oil leak that is really bad at high
&gt; RPMs. In fact it will coat the back of the van if I drive it on the highway
&gt; for a long time . It's time to do it . I'm a good mechanic , infact I did it
&gt; professionally for 13 years BUT not on VWs . I love the thing though and it
&gt; will get the service it needs . I will keep in touch .

Who is using the Pertronix Ignitor?
