There is a good description of how to service the sliding sunroof in the 
Bentley manual. It appears to be a Golde brand unit with which I have had 
the same experience recently in my '67 BMW. When the the handle turns freely 
with no motion of the roof, my experience is that the plastic slider/lifters 
which attach the back side edges of roof to the two operative cables that 
are driven by the hand crank have broken. Unfortunately, the cables and 
sliders are sold as a unit and are not repairable or separable. I was able 
to get a pair of such cables for a total cost of $120 from a BMW specialty 
vendor/wrecker (Double02 in Hayward, CA); the price from the BMW dealer is 
considerably higher. I took apart the roof, following the instruction in my 
factory shop manual, and successfully reassembled it, saving myself about 
$400 in labor! (It takes about half-a-day as a &quot;beginner&quot;). I suspect that 
is what has happened to yours. If you can get a hold of a Bentley, you'll 
see the procedure. I would be pleased to xerox the pages and send them to 
you.
(I doubt the problem is the gear on the hand crank, that is heavy duty 
compared to the plastic sliders!) It would appear that once every 20 or 30 
years these sliders will wear out and break; besides the tracks need to be 
cleaned and lubed, a preventive maintenance that might have extended the 
life of the sliders had I understood the friction that can develop over time 
as crud builds up in the tracks.
