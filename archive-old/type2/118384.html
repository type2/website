Subject: Re: [T2] tranny whine

Uh oh, I am putting a new polyurethane coupler on my trans as we speak. I
bought 2 couplers- the new stock one had slop brand new. The rubber sandwich
things moved around in the cage like 1/8 &quot; in either direction, very
un-German indeed. The urethane one from Transform is very securely welded
together and a very snug fit in the cage. Noise transmission...hmmm. I
wonder if he should try swapping a stock coupler back in and see if that
fixes the whining.

 &lt;Did you replace the coupler with the &quot;upgraded&quot; polyeurothane (sp?)
coupler
or the cheap rubber one.  I can tell you from experience that the cheap
rubber ones shifts just as well and does NOT transfer nearly as much noise
from the tranny through the linkage and into your interior.&gt;
