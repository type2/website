&gt;  ...But be careful about cutting it out.  To pass emissions, some states
&gt;  require that cars equipped with a catalytic converter have a restrictor
&gt;  plate (or &quot;bird beak&quot; in the case of our beloved VW's) and test for this. 
&gt;  In short, if the larger diameter leaded nozzle fits in the fuel filler, no
&gt;  emissions certification for you... 

This is the case in CA, I believe. Some 7 years ago I bought a '79 Westy
that did not have this part. I had to get one and install it to pass smog. 
Installing it was something of a PITA, since you have to go in through
that small circular access panel in the engine compartment on the
passenger side. Then reach way up inside and find a hose ring clamp
holding the rubber gas tank filler tube in place, Then unscrew the hose
clamp, install the bird beak thingy, then tighten the clamp again. You
can't see it and are working entirely by feel at arm's length up there,
while you lie in the back and reach in through the top engine hatch. A
shorty screwdriver is invaluable in this task. 

Years later I had a similar gas starvation problem with my '78 Westy. I 
pulled the gas tank, had it cleaned out, and it's been fine ever since. I 
never saw just what was in the tank. 

There's a quick and dirty Muldoon-type solution to the fuel starvation
problem that worked for me until my next rebuild when I could pull the
tank. There are two lines coming out of the gas tank on a FI bus, one
outward bound to the fuel filter and fuel pump, and one returning from the
pressure regulator at the end of the pressurized fuel loop. They are a few
inches apart on the bottom, center of the tank. If you insert a metal T
hose connection into each gas line just below where they take off from the
tank and connect the T's with a short piece of fuel line then fuel can
leave the gas tank through either line. Then crap in your gas tank needs
to plug up both lines to stop your fuel flow. This solved my fuel problems
for several thousand miles until I could pull the tank and do it right. I
still have that splice in my tank today, though I won't need it again for
many years until my clean tank accumulates a lot of crap again.

If you're going to do this, run the bus down to near empty first. You 
have to drain the gas tank to do it and it's much less work if there's 
only a gallon or so in there to begin with. 

It seems like in principal you might be able to remove the gas gauge on
top of the tank, and go fishing through that almost 2&quot; diameter hole for
something big like the birds beak rubber piece. But it would be very
ticklish work around all those gas fumes. Not very safe. Or pleasant. You
might blow yourself up trying. Maybe if you drained the tank, ventilated
it well somehow, then went fishing. Some kind of fiber optic periscope or
a surgeon's endoscopic tool would be very useful here. I don't think FLAPS
carries those though. 

You actual mileage may vary.
