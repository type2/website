Subject: [T2] Stupid VW-driver tricks or non-stock, not recommended, bad

On a slightly different side, of the 3 Bus's I have (all with type 4 motors)
not one came with a complete set of engine mounts! The worst had the
'moustache' bar firmly fastened to the body, but to my horror I discovered
the PO omitted the rubbers attaching it to the case. I never noticed and
difference driving it though.
Richard,
Brisbane Australia
