I have a similar question as to the front of the top lifting.
I have bought a set of rubber hold down clamps to install so the top does not 
lift in the wind.
Someone previously posted about a hold-down system with adjusting screws, 
I at times have felt that a heater boost would be a good idea and if anyone 
has installed a booster fan please post.
