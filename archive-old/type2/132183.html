Subject: Re: [T2] fuel line hoses...another question

Okay, Thanks to this list, I'm thoroughly scared of my old fuel hoses.  I
have been changing them one piece at a time, but it has brought up some more
issues.  As suspected they are cracked on the inside at the connections.

1.  How do I change the small pieces that go to the fuel injectors?  I can't
get them off!  They seem attached by a mechanism other than the standard
clamp.  Are they part of the FI unit?

2.  What about the plastic tubing (the stuff that is semi-rigid) that goes
across the chassis after the fuel pump?  It seems more durable, and I can't
find more of it. Replace with metal hose?  Trust it?

Thank you, Nik
