Subject: A/C and windows, was RE: First engine pull

All this talk of A/C... Makes me jealous...

Speaking of similarily spelled words... the jalouse windows ( I know it's not 
spelled right; it's too early in the morning!) - the ones with the glass 
flaps?  Anyway, mine are really loose and floppy (not the glass, the 
linkage)... does anyone know how to go about tightening up the linkage?  I 
have seen these where when one moves the knobs, the windows move, not taking 
3-4 turns to do anything, and flopping up and down in the slightest breeze.

Thanks bunches!
