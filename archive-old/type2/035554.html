Subject: turn signals

  This is a problem that I have been dealing with since I have owned Bertha,
I don't have any blinkers. the lights on the dash light up when I put them
on..they don't blink but both of the signals turn on at the same time.
Nothing in the rear though.  I have running lights and brake lights...the
bus had an engine fire before I owned her.  I have been able to get away
with it here in Montana but im moving to Colorado and they have vehicle
inspections so now im motivated to get this problem fixed..I put a new turn
signal switch in, checked the fuses.  I basically know i need to go back to
the tail lights and check every wire but figured i would ask the list for
any ideas
TIA
