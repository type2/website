&gt; I asked this question maybe 2 years ago, and was warned of the downside.
&gt; Still I fitted the tyre up front, and a few weeks back it rolled into a
&gt; wall. The whole impact was taken by the tyre and front panel. It never got
&gt; as far as the bumper which was supposed to take the jolt. I've now got a
&gt; front end with a lot of filler in. I guess I need the tyre up front to hide
&gt; the mess.

Might be cheaper to fix than if the bumper had impacted first!
