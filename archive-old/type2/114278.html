&gt;Did you install the lock-washers and backing plates under the CV bolts?
&gt;Preferably new lock washers? Apparently, the CV bolts can easily come lose

&gt;damage (ask me how i know).  Check ALL of the CV bolts for tightness.
&gt;Install washers and backplates if you don't have them.

I read somewhere it was a good idea to re-torque them a couple of weeks of driving after installation. I checked mine (new bolts but reused the rest of the hardware) and there wasn't a problem after several months.
