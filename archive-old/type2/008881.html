 &gt; 
 &gt; ...I am a bit apprehensive about the police reaction to all this, so I am
 &gt; considering taking a proactive approach to securing legal proof that the
 &gt; proposed transmitter is operating within the law.  At this point my approach
 &gt; is to assemble proof that I am legally operating an amateur radio
 &gt; transmitter on an frequency federally assigned to amateur radio, and that I
 &gt; have in good faith, where technically possible, attempted to prevent
 &gt; interference to police surveillance.  It might work in court, but I wonder
 &gt; what the patrolman on the street might think.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Any thoughts?
 &gt; 
 &gt; I think first off all you should stop to worry about the speeders, Everybody 
should be enough auto conscient to realize what he has to do... You're just 
gonna get big trouble on your ba..s for almost nothin' We are all responsable 
for our own lifes. You don't need to feel some kind of responsability for 
somebody others life. If they decide to try to reach they'r highest, leave 
'em... Probaly the human being learns just out of mistakes and pain...
