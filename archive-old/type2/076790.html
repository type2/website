009 will work fine in a 1600 motor. I would advise you to look at Boston
Bob's article about solex carb changes to get rid of that hesitation in 1st
gear. 009 is not adivisable for a type 4  motor.

Hi all,

I've read some of postings on 009 not a good choice for bus. The previous
owner of my newly painted 71 Westy kinda boasted that he put 009 into it,
and me being the first time bus owner thought that was cool.... However,
after reading some of your postings on 009, I am rethinking... What should
I
do? What exactly is 009 not a good choice for bus? Should I switch back to
vacuum advance unit?... I appreciate your help.

Thanks!
William
