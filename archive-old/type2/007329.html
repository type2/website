&gt;Will have a free AM 09x xxx xxx case bug eng tomorrow, to put in the rusty
$300 crew cab we just got. This isn't my dream engine, but will have to do
for now. Reading archives was great help in trying to understand the
&lt;

Krupps,
        The '68 to '71's have a brace that runs accross the back of the
engine that supports both the engine and tranny whereas the early buses and
all beetles have a brace on the tranny (T1's).  In other words, a T2 engine
will fit on a T1 b/c all that is needed is the four main bolts to hold the
engine to the tranny.  A T1 engine wont fit in a T2 b/c there are no bolt
holes for the engine brace on both sides of the oil pump cover.  There is
an aftermarket adapter that bolts to the oil pump cover to convert a T1 to
fit in a T2.  I have heard opinions go both ways, though.  Maybe someone
else on the list could share their experience.
