Subject: Re: [T2] Splitting cases; Belay my last post

Folks, I want to apologize.

After I sent the last post, I realized that my facial expression doesn't come 
through the telephone lines very well. I was chuckling at my ineptness at 
describing the situation I am in.

The cylinders and tin have been off this engine long enough that they are 
rusted:-)

There is un-cleaned-up-casting at the bottom of the cylinder bores that 
prevent the pistons froom withdrawing into the cases as I expected them to 
do. Quite a chunk of casting, not just something that could be knocked off 
with a file. I didn't look down inside there before I split the cases, 
thinking that surely there was  clearance for the pistons to go into the case.

I'm going to quit on it for now and wait until I have someone to help me so 
that I can stand the cases up on one side and try to fit the other case half 
to the bottom one. Doing it alone, I can't figure out what's keeping them 
from rotating into correct alignment.

Really, I just wanted to say how important it is to mention to newbies that 
they should remove the pistons *before* splitting the cases (at least for a 
1.7L)

Cheers/Carron
