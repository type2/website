Another possibility: the idle adjustment screw (I think that's the name of
it -- let's get technical and call it the little teeny one that sits above
the big fat one on the 34 PICT 3) could have been torqued down too much and
made blunt. This thing is needle sharp, and turning it in too much will dull
the end and make idle adjustments an impossibility. This has happened to me.
I know '70s didn't have this carb, but just about every '70 I have seen has
a dual port engine in it, and the 34 PICT 3 is what you get with the dual
port. Something upon which to ponder.

&gt; I'm having problems with my 70 Westy, she just wont idle.  I just
&gt; replace the entire exhaust and accelerator cable.  Checked the timing,
&gt; that looks ok.  Everything seems to be adjusted properly, but alas, it
&gt; just kills whenever I come to a stop.  Does anyone have any ideas what
&gt; else could be causing this?
