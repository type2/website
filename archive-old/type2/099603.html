Subject: Re: [T2] &lt;no subject&gt;

&gt;I have a 1957 single cab. I recently changed the hand shifter and reverse
&gt;lock out plate ( as the old shifter was worn to the point that the ball on
&gt;the bottom freely rotated and the shift play was very loose). I put in a
&gt;stock shifter and plate bolted it in and its was normal. Nice and snug, but
&gt;it won't go into reverse. Reverse worked fine with the old sloppy shifter
&gt;but the new one won't work. I tried loosening the bolts off but nothing? So
&gt;I swapped another plate and shifter from my other '57 bus. Same thing, no
&gt;reverse.

Replace the coupling out back and the shifter rod bushings. Readjust. Worse 
case the nose cone of the tranny may be worn.
