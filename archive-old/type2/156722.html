&gt; This was a couple years ago .. they *were* hiring, but it was
&gt; apparently only the &quot;big wing make Honda go fast&quot; type,
&gt; not people who know the difference between a sparkplug
&gt; and a brake caliper. :-/

The high-level people who know the difference between a sparkplug and a
brake caliper all have higher-paying jobs as service technicians.

Not aircooled _VW_ technicians, mind you, but the ability to read and
understand simple instructions does move them up the automotive ladder!
