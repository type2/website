&gt; Now, if we end-up with bar stock which is (less than)

&gt; and lock-down of the tin.  What do you think?

Clifford,

I'd have to go out and look, and right now it's 15 degrees out there,
so... no ;-)

I think you are on the right track.  If the 19mm stock does not interfere
with anything then that is lovely!  I was worried about interference with
the intake manifold but if you have a prototype installed then it can be
done and that's great.

&gt; Suspections for the NEED for the stand-off?  I no
&gt; longer have suspections.  I'm using a prototype now.
&gt; From a need or functionality stand-point, my 1978 VW
&gt; T2 Temp 2 sensor has a jury-rigged stand-off right
&gt; now, and the engine warm-up problem symptoms have
&gt; disappeared.  The stand-off solved the warm-up idle
&gt; problem.  My vehicle definitely needs this stand-off.
&gt; So from the standpoint of NEED for this part, I know
&gt; it is needed.  I presume my bus has need of the
&gt; stand-off due to the temperature differences with the
&gt; Spanish/Portugese Heads I am currently running, versus
&gt; the heads VW used originally, and designed the Bosch
&gt; Temp 2 sensor for.  (I'm currently running heads
&gt; purchased from www2.cip1_dot_com of part number
&gt; VWC-039-101-061-M.  The country of manufacture shows I
&gt; think as Portugal.  I know the Brazilians speak
&gt; portugese, but the heads are not Brazilian, they are
&gt; Portugese or Spanish.)

Have you used an O2 sensor to check the mixture at operating temperature,
both with and without the stand-off? My concern is that even a small
amount of heat radiation off the stand-off will lower the sensed
temperature during operation and lean the mix.  Not a lot, just a little,
but I would worry until I knew.  Of course insering a low-value resister
would probably make up for the temperature loss but then you are back to
square one on the starting.  The whole subject of heat transmission,
transfer, and radiation within and between different metals and alloys
gets very complicated very fast.

OOK!
