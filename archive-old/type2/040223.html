    Hi All.

  Just got home from the Vintage VW show in Auburn Hills MI and was very
impressed with the amount of busses that made it. Met Jamie Rivers from
Ontario and John H. from Flint Michigan.
The Denmiester from Ont. was there and we planned to meet but i think we
were always at opposite ends of the show!
   The VW museum was cool with many mint examples.
The 73 ran great and the new Conti tires made the drive even better.
Made some small purchases at the swap meet (didn't want to get busted at the
border) but they never looked anyway. I bought a set of fuses, a set of
pushrod tube seals and a rear shift rod coupler all for about 10$!
Also had to by a new T.

Anyway just thought i'd let everyone know whats happening Up here.
