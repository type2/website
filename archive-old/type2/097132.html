Subject: Uh-oh ... what have I got here?

My 1970 westy, 1600 DP, seemed to have been losing ooomph the last few
months, but I didn't give it much thought other than to tweak the carb and
timing.

Today it was laboring more than usual and slowing at the slightest grade.
Finally it gave up the ghost entirely. I was able to get it started but
could only crawl along at 15-20 on level terrain. When I came to a 5% grade
I couldn't get over it and had to be towed 33 miles home.

Once back in the garage I pulled successive distributer wires and found I
was running on only 2 cyclinders, #1 &amp; #2. Numbers 3 and 4 were getting
spark but not contributing. I did a quick compression check and found 60 lbs
on #3 and about 30 lbs on #4. I pulled the valve cover to see if I could see
anything amiss among the valves and couldn't. Then I put a socket on the one
accessible stud nut and to my suprise it turned easily. I took off the
rocker and tried the other three. They all turned easily. I'm guessing none
of them had more than a few pounds of torque. My supposition is they weren't
torqued down tight enough by the PO and my switch to super lubricating
Mobil-1 this summer may have helped them vibrate a bit looser.

My first question is ould this be the source of my compression loss? I'm
tempted to torque the nuts properly and run another compression test
tomorrow, but even if I get good readings I suspect the wisest course still
will be to pull the engine and check everything. Well, winter is coming on
and maybe that's not such a bad thing.

I would be interest in any feedback.
