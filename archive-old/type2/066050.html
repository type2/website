Sounds like a deal to me.  One bad thing that can happen to a 
vehicle (outside of a crash or fire) is NOT using it.  Letting a 
vehicle sit for prolonged periods does nasty things to it.  I own a 
'67 Squareback ripe for the fixin' and sharing.  Been sitting for 
a few years here in the CA foothills.  I would rather see it fixed, 
used, and appreciated for the fine sports car that it is, than keep 
hearing my SO complain about the 'junker in the back'.   I have space 
(uncovered) and tools.  Main part I am looking for is a choke 
element for the left carb.  Anyone up for rebuilding a pair of carbs?
I have an extra pair of them.  It's sitting for lack of money and 
time to go through it to get it back on the road.  Extra hands to 
share the load and driving enjoyment would be welcome.  
( I know, I know, it's not a bus, but it's the first VW I owned, and 
from that experience I went onto a '64 Deluxe Bus)
I have been told that it handles better than later Type 3's!
