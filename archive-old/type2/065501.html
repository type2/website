&gt;Any club that was that snooty personally I would not waste 
&gt;my time with, who needs that kind of attitude?? To me the 
&gt;hobby is supposed to be fun not a country club etc.

Harummph...Well, if that's the prevailing sentiment on this list, looks like
I won't be starting that red-'71 Westy-with-'73-seats-only club.  And I was
all psyched up to be the president! 

Clubs: if you can't join 'em, spoof 'em.
