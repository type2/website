hello melissa:

i think i may be able to help.
i had the same problem, hazards worked but not the turn signals.  check the 
little level that operates the hazards, you know the button that you pull in 
and out.  you need to remove the speedometer cable and remove the air vent 
levels in order to pull the &quot;dash&quot; out, because you're going to have to get 
to the housing where the hazzard's button (level) is.

you'll find a metal case with a bunch of wires attached to a plastic thing 
that is mounted right on top of that metal case, which in turn is where the 
level(button) of the hazzards is. when you pull or push, that thing moves 
inside the metal case making contact with the appropriated terminals mounted 
on the plastic thing that make the hazzards and the turn signals work.  (are 
you with me?)

well, i found that my plastic thing was loose, so when i pulled, the 
contacts for the hazzards were working but the turn signals were not making 
any contact.

solution::

i remove the cables, and secured (tight) the plastic thing on top of the 
metal case with the level(button) pushed in.  then return the wires back in 
place, and it worked.

it happened again, so i did the same procedure, my metal case is old and is 
breaking on the edges so i am on the lookout for that piece in a junkyard or 
something. it is working right now, and everytime it happens i just do the 
same thing and it gets fixed.  the other thing that i may have to do is use 
some crazy glue or something similar, but i am trying not to use anything 
and save that as a last resource.

i hope this solves your problem, if it doesn't , it must be something else.

ps: this is the first time i give advice to someone, most likely i did not 
explain myself right. if you have any questions feel free to ask me again.

paz
