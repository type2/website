Subject: Vapor Lock?

Hello everybody,
  I have heard so much about it, and know how bad it can be, but have never 
had it explained to me. What is vapor lock, and what does it stem from?  Is 
there anyway to avoid it?
  I know that its in your fuel pump, and thats about all i know. Can anybody 
help me?

Thanks,
  Matt O.
