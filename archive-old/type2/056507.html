One for the fuel injection wizards!

79 westy, california emissions, FI and Hall ingnition, 135,000 mi.  I have
a very intermittent engine misfire at power.  99.9% of time the engine runs
fine.  Fellow listee described a similar problem with his '78 and corrected
the problem with new air flow meter (AFM).  I looked inside my AFM and
noticed small areas where conductor material had worn through under the
path of the wiper contacts.  Archives (applause for Steve) had single
thread talking about slightly shifting the circuit board on which the
conductor material is located so that wiper contacts rub a new area on the
conductor.  Originator of thread had watercooled vanagon with other
problems also, but it appeared to work.  Has anyone else tried shifting the
PCB inside the AFM this way???  Does it work?  I'm planning a couple of
long trips in the next month and am debating the purchase of a new AFM,
just in case.

comments, wisdom, incantations welcome.
