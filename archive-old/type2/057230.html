Jeff,

I didn't learn until now that the muffler had not arrived.  I did not see
your e-mail because I am not checking my Bus Depot e-mail regularly due to
being so busy.  This will change in a few weeks when the new website is up.
You should have received an auto-response to this effect, suggesting that
you call if you needed a prompt response.  However, I understand that some
ISP's mistake the autoresponder for SPAM, and filter it out rather than
passing it on to their subscribers.  I have also put a notation to this
effect on the website.  It is best to call (215-234-VWVW) for the short
term, until the new website is up.

In any event, I immediately put a call into RMMW to find out what happened,
and left a message on their voice mail.  Usually they are very prompt and
ship the same day.  I'm sure they'll get back to me tomorrow and I can let
you know what happened.

&gt; I've been waiting 3 weeks for my muffler....
&gt;
&gt; I'm figuring this is one of those things that gets drop shipped from
&gt; RMMW- does it always take this long?
