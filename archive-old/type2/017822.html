&gt;I trust this isn't an utter waste of bandwidth. Which would be the

&gt;
&gt; #1. Private Owner, '76 Westfalia, supposedly runs great.

&gt; #2. Slimey Dealership, '75 Campmobile
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; Both boxes are going for $1000.
&gt;
&gt; My goal is to have a roadworthy daily driver/family camper. I'll have
&gt; about $500 to put into repairs right off the bat, with a $100-200 a
&gt; month maintenance budget thereafter. I've done some engine work in the
&gt; wayback past and have a fair amount of experience with grumpy vehicles
&gt; (Triumph Bonneville, '69 Saab) but I've got no VW experience.
&gt;
 &gt; Everything else being equal, which would be the better 1st bus? Is
there
&gt; anything in particular that I should look for in a camper of this
&gt; vintage?
&gt;
&gt; Any and all insights/opinions appreciated (private e-mail, of course.)
&gt;
&gt; (My hunch is saying go with #2 Slimey Dealer...please don't let me hurt
&gt; myself.)
&gt;
&gt; Thank you for your forebearance and sagacity.
Phil:
I'd have to know more about the mileage and mechanical condition
particularly of number 1, but that one, (76), is a 2-liter and higher
geared. The Riviera is an unknown in the midwest, but I'd probably lean
more toward the Westy (perhaps I'm just a little ignorant in this).
The greater rust of #1 is a concern and I'd look it over really closely
to see how bad it is, particularly in the sliding door channel area.
That is very difficult to fix, if badly rusted.
If the rust isn't TOO bad, I'd prefer the 76.
