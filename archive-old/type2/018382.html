Hi Phil,

&gt; Judging from the archives, it sounds like something rather simple has
&gt; gone amiss inside the nosecone. (There is a fairly healthy oil leak
&gt; there now, it seems.) But before I pull engine and tranny, what should 
&gt; Ibe inspecting? Is there something I should be looking at closer to
&gt; the shifter?

Yes, you should. Check out the little plack plate that is used to hold
your shifter to the cabin floor. It might be loose, or perhaps you
should remove it to look underneath. I once had about the same problem.
It was due to a metal pin that had gotten out of the ball shaped bottom
part of the shifter. This would also mean that the shifter feels as it
if it is completely loose.

If the shifter still feels firm then you could try to adjust the plate
which holds the shifter. If you move it around you'll notcive that the
position of all the gears will change. Check out one of your repair
manuals to find out how it should be exactly fitted, you can also try it
yourself.
