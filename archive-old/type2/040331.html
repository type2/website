Subject: Re Starting problems relays etc

Hi guys,
 the other advantage of using a relay for the starter solenoid is that the
starter switch is protected from excess currents.
When I got my bus it refused to turn over on occassions. PO said &quot;starter
solenoid is playing up needs replacing&quot;
I followed the diagnosis procedures in bartotek on the list site and found
that the problem was actually the aftermarket push switch on the dash which
was wired up with very thin wires. It was burnt out and felt gravelly. New
switch, relay (30A Bosch horn relay) no further probs.
Jeff
