Subject: Re: [bus-life] Need a life!

Hi John,

I would recommend a compression test, that will tell you if running
lean has killed a valve. You might also want to check the torque on the
heads, you could have something loose there as well. Is the ticking in
any particular location?

Happy trails,

&gt; On a technical note, my bus engine seems to be &quot;ticking&quot; a little more
&gt; than it
&gt; should (71 Westy w 1600 DP engine).
&gt; &lt;SNIP&gt;
&gt; I did adjust valves last night, #2 &amp; #3 were a little tight, but
&gt; correcting
&gt; that still didn't kill the clicking sound. It's probably just me being
&gt; paranoid, as I said the bus is running greater than ever now that I
&gt; have
&gt; gotten the fuel tank thing worked out and the timing set correctly and
&gt; accurately (thanks to my new timing light!)
