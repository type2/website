Here in Florida it just doesn't get cold enough to be concerned about a
heater most of the time. However, I am considering a winter trip to the
UP of Michigan in my '79 Westy, and a heater would be a necessity. Who
makes Wasserboxers, and where can I get one? Has anyone tried the DC
heaters, and are they for sufficient in a very cold climate?
