Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Drops and Dirty Cylinders | Day 2

My bus is only done because we didn't drop the Great White Engine. Lack of
head gaskets (!_at_#$_at_%^$#%$^ Painter's Grinding SUCKS!) kept me from that.

However, the stuff camping out over the #1 cylinder was probably the cause
of my seat sinking. I'm hoping removing it will stop the sinking for a
while.

The other big thing that needed done was the rear main seal. When I switched
to synthetic oil for a while it found a path around that seal causing oil to
hit the fan and get sprayed all through the engine. Getting everything out
up to the fan hub was easy. No puller = no hub off. What to do? I used a
heavy steel ruler behind the hub then threaded the screws in. The ruler
braced against the case and the screws pushed the hub off. Easier than I had
expected. (One ruler means tighten screw, back it off, put ruler behind next
screw, rinse, repeat.)

The pics of my fan shroud didn't do it justice. It was the most sparkly
paint I had ever seen. When I was spraying it the sparkles hung in the air
like Tinker Bell's Fairy Dust.

Here's the best pic:

After spending time scrubbing oily greasy yucky tinwork, Troy comes up with
the pressure washer! Sweeeeeet. Stand and spray. WooHoo! The big blue tub in
the pics was filled with a gallon of purple power and 5 gallons of water.
Even with vigorous brushing I wasn't getting into the really old grunge. But
once clean, most of my tinwork got hit with rattlecan DupliColor truck
bedliner. I love the look and durability of that stuff.

Anyway, I still have a few things to do, but it's mostly back together. The
Great White Bus shall swim again.

Now, for Troy's engine.

We have gotten conflicting responses from people, some saying &quot;It's ok, just
run it&quot; and others saying &quot;New rings STAT!&quot; Troy has another engine rebuilt
just a few thousand miles ago, that for some reason he disassembled
(something about exhaust... I think he was curious what it looked like
inside!) Anyway after learning how to use the pin pliers to remove the
circlips, he was a piston removing madman. He got the pistons off all 8
cylinders (that's both engines), and the 4 known good ones on the engine
we're using. Then came the fun of trying to find a way to get the rings
compressed.

See, a &quot;normal&quot; ring compressor won't work. It has to go between the case
and the cylinder, and be able to come apart once trapped by the cylinder
that's sliding over the piston. Hence his attempt using a hose clamp. I like
the idea better than what we were doing... He was using his fingernail to
get the rings pressed in to fit in the cylinder! It actually worked well
until we got to the oil control ring. You know, that paper thin pair of
rings that looks like they'll give you a nasty paper cut if you're not
careful? We used some 1/4&quot; thick acrylic to push them down, but it was a
real PITA.

At the end my wife had to come pry me away from my bus so I could get some
sleep. Troy took advantage of the engine being out to clean 25 years of
grime out of his engine compartment. And to discover a stealth dent on his
bus behind the right hand tail light. heh

Fun fun fun!!! I'm sooo sore now. LOL
