       The 009 is for bugs, the vacuum-less dizzy for buses is 050, but
for the T4 engine, which has a much greater advance curve, the stock
dizzy is best, as even the 050 doesn't advance far enough, so you have
to put the initial advance much higher, which can cause starting
problems in cold climes. And especially with an auto trans, the stock is
by far the best -- the vacuum-less dizzys are really for racing, not
street use, and really only for the upright T1 engines.
