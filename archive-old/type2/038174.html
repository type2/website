&gt;&gt;Citroen 2CV

&gt;Damn!  I'd love to have one.  Not practical, though.

Why is it not practical? 4 doors, big sunroof (just think of the possibilities of loading it from the top ...), easily removed rear bench, seats four adults, top speed around 75 mph (of course not with 4 people ...), engine can be changed even faster than in a VW, extremely simple to work on.

Top of all the most fuel efficient car I ever had, approx. 5.5L/100km and low tax and insurance (important in Europe).

And it's an air-cooled aluminum case boxer engine (just lacking 2 cylinders).
