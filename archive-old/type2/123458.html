Subject: Thermastat Parts needed

Greetings,

'79 FI 2.0 Liter

I am looking for the plastic cooling flap bushings that go on the top of the 
fan housing. I also need the (2?) little peice(s) of flat metal that hold 
down the flaps and the screws that go with them. I have the flaps themselves 
but not much else. The flaps and thermastat were never installed on my 
engine, 60k miles.

What is the story with our thermastats? NLA but bug ones can be modified? 
How? Any articles? Does anyone have what I need in this department that they 
might be willing to part with, stock stuff? Thermastat, bracket, pullies, 
fancy bolts, cable.

Thanks for educating me,
Brandt
