Subject: Re:*1978 Westy Deluxe &gt;$10,500?
Date: Wed, 04 Nov 98 18:15:58 PST
From: Nick Pace &lt;nickpace_at_rand_dot_org&gt;

  Marty Wallace &lt;martywallace_at_rocketmail_dot_com&gt; said (in part):
    I've been informed of a 1978 Westy Deluxe, 88k miles, original owner,
    &quot;fully restored&quot; (and in Louisiana) The current owner is fishing for
    offers, but claims to have turned down $10,500; I guess that this
    indicates that he's looking for something in the neighborhood of $12k
    (or more).  Does this seem reasonable to folks here?  Should I take
    the time to go all the way to LA to see this?  Any thoughts, opinions,
    ideas?

Sounds crazy.  In the winter of 1977-1978, I flew down from Eugene, Oregon
back to L.A. from where I and my '69 Type III had left to go to grad
school.  I had bought an EMPI battery from Bob Smith VW in Hollywood in
about 1974 or so but when the battery proved defective in the Pacific
Northwest rain belt, I found out that the &quot;lifetime warranty&quot; meant
nothing since EMPI had gone out of business.  Thankfully, Bob Smith told
me to bring it in for a full refund (a bit difficult given that I now
lived 1200 miles away) so that Christmas vacation, I stuffed the battery
into a knapsack and checked it in at the airport before boarding my
flight.  I still remember the battery acid spilling all over the luggage
conveyer belt at LAX as the sack tumbled end over end.  If your 10 piece
Samsonite matched set was ruined that day, I'm sorry.  Honest.  Does it
help to know that Bob indeed gave that starving student his money back as
promised?

Anyway, while in the showroom waiting for them to inspect the battery, I
saw a brand new 1978 VW camper with all the goodies and painted in the
standard lime green/yellow trim outfit.  I can still remember looking at
the sticker and being absolutely floored to see that they wanted just over
ten thousand dollars for the rig!  My mouth dropped open and the sales folks
did their best to explain to me all the fancy options this baby had but I
was incredulous that anyone could even think to pay that much for any motor
vehicle no matter what bells and whistles it possessed.  I have never been
subject to as intensive level of sticker-shock since.  For many years I
used that ten grand as a benchmark whether a vehicle was &quot;expensive&quot; or
&quot;reasonable&quot;.

Unless your friend in Lousiana bought that same camper from Mr. Smith and
had it shipped straight to a warehouse where it has been hermetically
sealed since I last laid eyes on it, it just ain't worth ten-five.


Nick

(P.S., to avoid the yelling I'm sure to get: though what I did with the
battery was stupid and dangerous, it wasn't yet illegal.  FAA regs against
shipping caustic materials weren't adopted until later.)
