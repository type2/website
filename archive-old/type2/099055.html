Subject: Re: [T2] Intake manifold gaskets.

Thanks All:

I have replaced all the gaskets hoses on air distributor and still have vacuum
around 15.2 inHg. I suspect the gasket between the runners and the cylinder
head. I will check with carburetor cleaner before I go through your whole
exercise.

Let me get some things clear on your steps:

&gt; Now, there are _two_ gaskets in this area.  First, the boots which connect
&gt;   the runners to the manifold.
&gt;

You mean the rubber connecting hoses to the air distributor?

&gt; Also, there is a riser (with paper
&gt;   gaskets on both sides) between the runners and the heads.
&gt;

This is the gasket between the runner tubes and the cylinder head? What I have
been referring to as the intake manifold gasket. My new gaskets are some sort
of plastic/bakelite material with graphite coated paper on the outside.


&gt; When reinstalling the runners, I didn't use any gasket compound (though
&gt;   I'm not sure if this was the right thing to do.)  I had to use a rubber
&gt;   mallet to work them into place with the new boots.  Be sure you get the
&gt;   injectors back in _straight_ (you might as well replace the small gaskets
&gt;   on these guys too, if you are going through all this trouble in the first
&gt;   place).
&gt;

I am assuming the mallet was to get the runner tubes into the rubber hoses
(boots). When I put them on the first time, I had to remove the air
distributor. It was really tuff putting then on by hand.

My injectors have new gaskets and new hoses, but I think I will remove them
just to get them out of the way.

Was the crack in your gaskets very noticeable? What did your vacuum become
after the repair?
