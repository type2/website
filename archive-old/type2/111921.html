Subject: Re: [T2] what years are diesel engines available

&gt; There is a course at a local community college in the
&gt; area that converts 
&gt; diesel engines to biodiesel (grease cars) Any way, I was
&gt; wondering what 
&gt; years the diesel engine was available for buses?
&gt; Is it difficult to put a diesel engine in body that was
&gt; originally set up 
&gt; for a gasoline engine?
VW put the diesel engine is the vanagon in '82 and '83(ok,
well they still did until the end...just not in the usa!) 
;-(
if you have a water cooled  vanagon..pretty easy to do if
you talk to the people who've done it...just some vibration
woes to work through at first
I've heard of people doing so in a bay bus too...making a
round radiator taht looks like a spare tyre!  can be a lot
of wwork, but get best to both worlds?  I anna do that
myself, but will just help my friend re-do the vanagon
deisel he bought with dead engine and put the quantum
turbo-diesel in it)

I have a friend who has a company that sells biodeisel
conversion kits for volkswagons and mercedes if youo go
that way...i will eventually in something...just not my '78
