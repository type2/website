&gt; The PO of my 72 Adventure Camper was a serious Deadhead, and the bus
is
&gt; covered in all kinds of stickers.  Unfortunately, several of them are
&gt; stuck directly on the paint of the rear hatch and engine compartment
&gt; lid.  Anyone got any recommendations on how to remove these stickers
&gt; without damaging the paint?  I was hoping there is some kind of magic
&gt; solvent that will take the stickers off, but leave the paint
unharmed. 
&gt; The PO also &quot;played for the other team&quot; so to speak, so I really would
&gt; like to get these rainbow stickers off my camper.

If the stickers are paper, try hand lotion.  Apply it every couple of
hours for a day or two and remove the sticker.

Lighter fluid also works, but I don't know about the paint.

Vinyl stickers will usually yield if they are heated with a hair dryer
or heat gun.

Soon your bus will be ready for those &quot;Quayle for Prezdent&quot; stickers! :)

&gt; Also, in my 71 bus, I have massive exhaust leaks.  The damn thing
sounds
&gt; like a Harley. ;)
&gt; The muffler (last replaced 4 years ago) and the heat exchangers (never
&gt; replaced) are rusted badly.  In the 8 years I have owned that bus, the
&gt; heat has never worked.  Turn on the heat, and you got exhaust in the
&gt; cab.  I am getting sllleeeeeeeppppyyyy.  Well, living is So Cal, I can
&gt; live without the heat, but the noise is starting to bother me. 
Since I
&gt; don't need heat, an extractor seems the way to go.  But after reading
&gt; the Hoover Sermons, Bob seems really against extractors.  I really
don't
&gt; want to spend the big money for a pair of heat exchangers when I don't
&gt; need the heat.  Also, I hear those Brazillian ones don't last.
&gt; 
&gt; What are my other options?  Is there some kind of item that I can
use to
&gt; replace the heat exchangers and still use the stock exhaust?  Bob only
&gt; mentions not liking the &quot;cheap&quot; extractors.  Are there good
extractors? 
&gt; The only ones I have seen are what RMMW carries.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the help,
