&gt; I've tried those wrap-around electronic wire labels with the numerals
&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4.  They lend a real professional look to things. For about
&gt; a week.  They then unwrap and fall off.
&gt;
&gt; I have painted stripped bands around the wires  with a white
&gt; permanent marker pen.  These look great too, until I have to grab the
&gt; wire; the marks flake off with the slightest touch.
&gt;
&gt; Suggestions for neat ways to identify these wires?

I use color coded shrink wrap, a half inch length slippped on then shrunk
in place..  if possible I put a similar piece on the other half of the
connection.    for plug wires you could use 1 ring 2 rings etc...the stuff
comes in at least a dozen colors and diameters.  the electronic place I go
to has packages of small rings in various colors.

quite inexpensive
