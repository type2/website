Subject: fuel line blues OVER!

Thanks to all who guided me.
It wasn't that tough after I melted the ice/snow off
the undercarriage and could see what was what. 

Would have been done last week, if the FLAPS guy
hadn't sold me the wrong size tubing. He nor I knew
that only the correct metric would work.

Didn't put a fuel cutoff or a filter in line. (I had
to get back on the road ASAP.)

If a guy was to put a fuel filter in line, where's a
good place and what's a good filter? I have a tractor
filter the size of a can o' beans. (?)
