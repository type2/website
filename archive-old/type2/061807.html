Subject: Re: Synoil: Amsoil vs. others?

    Just an aside on recycling oil -- in WI, it's the law. And there are
plenty of recycling centers to take the oil. In Alabama, I found that
many FLAPS had a sign saying they took old oil, and they didn't care if
you had bought it originally from them. Don't know about other states,
but I'd bet in most you can find recyclers pretty easy..
    When I was logging I used up all of my old oil myself, using it for
bar &amp; chain oil in the chainsaw. Was kinda' dirty looking, and didn't
stick to the chain like the $15 _at_ gallon stuff, but I just turned the
flow up a bit more. Also burned some in a barrel stove, using a homemade
copper pipe and valve arrangement that let it drip slowly into the wood
fire.
