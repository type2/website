Subject: Re: [T2] Tune-up Freq with Bruck 205; Bosch Qual Decl

Reviewed the T2 Archives on the topic of &quot;Ballast.&quot; 
An eye opener.
    
Ballast Resistor.  I've owned and maintained cars
where the ballast resistor failure would prevent the
engine from running.  And the Ballast Resistor for a
80 Volare was only $2.50.  But what a difference if
the old one was not operational.
    
Yes Don, I will measure the resistances at several
points in my ignition system and get back to you.  I'm
a little surprised that a Bosch Blue coil is not
necessary a Bosch Blue coil.  
    
So as it stands now, I either need to purchase an
external Ballast resistor for connection in-line with
the coil + connector, or I need to purchase a coil
with an internal ballast resistor already installed. 
Is that correct, should my resistance measurements
indicate so?
