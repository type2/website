Subject: Re: FS: 68 camper w/tent, Seattle

&gt;As seen in Seattle Times of 7/24. All disclaimers apply.
&gt;
&gt;$1850, (206)323-9318. records from '72.

Damn. Talked down to $1650, this parses to around $1100 less tent.

Wanabussers, take note: you can unload the tent anytime, there are always
people here and on v_at_l salivating over Westy tents. Think of it as a
rebate. If the bus is not a rust heap, this is a helluva deal. Pluswise,
68-70 are *the* busses to learn on. The ultimate in easy maintenance.
Engine slides out like a drawer.
