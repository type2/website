Subject: RE: [T2] alternator directions

Not sure on this one but, I have contimplated an additional alt. in the 
place of the A/C Compressor I pulled off. It could be used as a welder or 
just a battery charger for many accesories. But I have to get on the road 
and take care of many issues prior to addons.

&gt;From: &quot;Tom Smith&quot; If an alternator spins in either direction, it should 
&gt;create the same DC
&gt;current since it is creating AC that is running through a rectifier.
&gt;Correct?

&gt;Therefore, besides the fan in the pulley not being right, the alternator
&gt;itself should work just as well spinning either way?
