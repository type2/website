I have gone something like 90,000 miles with no EGR and I have never had a
valve seat drop.  Even with GEX heads.  :)  But why did you disconnect your
EGR?  Unless it's causing a problem, why not leave it connected?  

One important thing - If you disconnected the EGR pipe, make sure you plug
the hole in the manifold or you will have a vacuum leak, lean mixture, and
major problems.
