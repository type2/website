Subject: [T2] Towing with a Bus

		At this time I am still not sure as to the best Bus to get
to meet my needs, but one thing is sure, and that is that it will need to
tow a small pop-top trailer. I know we talked about this earlier and the
masses say its OK to tow with a Bus. What I want to know is, what can I do
to ensure good service and long life if I do tow several time a year.
		One of the Buses I am looking at right now is a 74. Would it
be a good idea to install a 228mm clutch to give more hold? I have the
flywheel, would a 091 Bell housing be required? Will it fit an 002? It needs
a new trans anyway, should I get an 091 to begin with? I think the engine is
stock.  I would love to order a custom made trans, but I will not have that
kind of money. I need to know what trans would be the best of the used
available. I may rebuild it in the future if needed. The engine needs help,
so I may install one of my 2.0L blocks I have to help with power(with Big
valve 1.8L heads)
		Would an external oil cooler be a good addition, or a waist
of time and money? 
		I also have a Vanagon available to me at a good price. Its
an 80 and the lady said she blew a head gasket. It is an air cooled so I am
guessing it sucked a valve or dropped a seat. She said it still runs, but
poorly. Would this be a better tow vehicle, or would the Bus be just as
good. I have owned several Buses and have tons of parts for them, I like the
bay windows, but if the Vanagon would be better I may go that route. 
		If I do go Vanagon, what should I do to help it work good as
a tow vehicle? My heart is stuck on Bays, but I want to make the best use of
my money.
