Subject: AIRS: [WetWesties] need help near Palm Springs

One of our listmembers needs help on I-10 near Palm Desert.  Anyone in 
the Inland Empire that can lend a hand? (or a tow for thirty or so 
miles where the AAA will kick in?)

Yes, I am stranded at Palm Desert, Which is near Palm
Springs, after a good weekend in the desert.  luckily
I can stay here over night with a friend, but not a VW
person at all ;-((

Oil came smoking out the rear driver side (#3 and 4) ,
I lost power, the engine did restart AFTER WAITING AN
HOUR. But it still smells burned, and seems to be on 3
cyclinders. CAN I DRIVE IT THIS WAY?

I have 130 miles to get to my own mechanic at Sunland,
near San Fernando, (where he may chew me out)  I have
AAA Plus. Problem is no tow company would take me home
today! Also, I have to pay for the extra 30 or 40
miles at $7/mile I think, so I thought I'd get about
20 miles from LA, sleep over in the van, then get
another 100 from AAA tomorrow - I don't even know if I
can.

AAA KEPT ME WAITING NEARLY 2 HRS ON THE i-10, IT WAS
SO NOISY AND HAIR-RAISING, i COULD NOT MAKE ANY
DECISIONS, AND THE TOW DRIVER WAS SURLY AND COULD NOT
EVEN GIVE ME A QUOTE FROM THE EXTRA MILES to LA, NOR
DID HE KNOW A VW MECHANIC ANYWHERE! And they wanted to
dump me at a gas station and do a 're-route' later
tonight, which they will not do from my friends house!
what AM i ASKING dear fellow wet-westies, (AND i AM
SORRY ITS NOW ALL CAPS) CAN ANYONE LEND A SYMPATHETIC
EAR AND SUGGEST HOW i CAN GET BACK TO la ON MY AAA 100
  OVER 2 DAYS, or A GOOD MECHANIC SAY 20 OR SO MILES
EAST OF la. And please, don't shout at me for going too
fast (65 for an 90 minutes)

Olive, WHO HAD A wonderful WEEKEND OTHERWISE.
71 Westy.
  home where John is trying to get answers for me (323-933-1691)
I can answer e-mail too, Thank you , thank you thank you.

The first lemming to lead his peers off the cliff is a bold and 
decisive leader.
