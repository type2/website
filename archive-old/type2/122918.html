Subject: Sliding door question

&gt;Then I lubed the heck out of it with WD40

No you didn't. 

You probably know this, but it's important for new volk. WD-40 is a solvent, not a lubricant. 

I learned this when I soaked my roller blade bearings in it when I was in high school (DOH!) The bearings spun extremely fast, but I had a roostertail of welding sparks behind me 20' long.

&gt;I discovered the lube hole in the mech, too.
&gt;I lubed it up before I reassembled it.

Lubed it? Or WD-40'd it? 

&quot;Keep it greasy so it
Goes down easy&quot;
