Well I think that I have now read almost all the archives regarding ignition 
but alas I have not found the solution, so I come to you great gurus!

I have a '79 Westy with a Cali engine but the FI system is non-cali (I don't 
have an ignition control unit). I believe the problem is with the ignition, 
the engine turns over and I can hear the fuel being supplied to the engine 
but it doesn't start.

Within the past year (with less than 300km of driving) the following have 
been replaced in order
- Points
- Distributor Cap
- Spark plug wires
- Battery
- Coil
- Condenser

From the coil I have the following wires
Terminal 15 (+)
- From aux heater blower
- To double relay
Terminal 1 (-)
- To condenser
- To AFC unit

The tests I have done and results that I found…

The coil
1. Measured 12.4 volts at terminal 15 with ignition switched on (is this too 
high?)
2. When cranking I get a good spark at a distance of 1/4&quot;, blue in colour 
but with a couple orange flashes.
3. With the engine turned so that points are closed and the ignition on
a. from terminal 1 (-) to ground reads 1.3 V  (should not have a reading)
4. Used a pencil to open the points when I opened them I got a small spark.
a. from terminal 1 to ground reads 12.2 V
*NOTE: The points and the (+) side of the coil got quite hot during this 
test (a clue perhaps?)

The new coil is a 12V Wells it doesn't have a visible resistor but neither 
did the old Bosch coil.

I measured the resistance between the coil terminals and got the following 
readings.
1 &amp; 15  - 1.1 ohms
1 &amp; 4 and 4 &amp; 15  - flashes of readings between 1300 and 1900 ohms. (not a 
steady reading)

The coil got really really hot one time when I was running these tests could 
this have fried my new coil?

The condenser
1. I took off the wire from terminal 1 (-) and with the ignition on I put my 
test light between terminal 15 and the wire going to the condenser. No 
light. So it tests ok.


Thanks in advance for any help that you can offer.
