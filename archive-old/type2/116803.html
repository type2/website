Subject: Re: [T2] popping, and repair shop

&gt;actually, it's not a backfire, it is a misfire.  I had that problem once 
&gt;before, but the backfire always came at decelleration.  The points are new, 
&gt;and came with the distributor.  I had an 009 on it and thought it may be 
&gt;the problem, but after replacing with new, I still have it.
&gt;

Did you replace the coil? I think it's electrical in nature and maybe a coil 
going bad and not firing all the time?? Just a guess from an idiot.
