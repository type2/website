Subject: ADMIN: KILL THIS THREAD Re: [T2] replacement body panels

With all due respect, everyone here has been &quot;warned&quot; repeatedly.  The 
charter of this list does not include policing its members therefore I 
need to ask that everone PLEASE stop discussing this subject on the 
list.  If you want to discuss it with the admins, that is fine.  If the 
admins come to a concensus that something needs to be done, fine but it 
will be discussed offline or not at all.

&gt; As a community service, I think it's time to boot this guy from the  
&gt; list before any members get their $9,000 worth of bondo and end up  
&gt; broke;  sick to their stomach with an unfinished job that will cost  
&gt; even more to repair and disappointed that no one here warned them.
