Subject: Re: [T2] now what??  no fire in #2

Bob,

I know you already know all this, but... Back to basics...  Fuel, Air,
Compression, Spark.

Fuel: is that injector firing?  check voltage  at the plug, then pull that
half of the fuel ring and run it into a pair of cups for a couple seconds.
Does the cup under #1 have more fuel in it than the cup under #2?

Air:  Still breathing?  OK, then we have air :-) (sorry, I hadda :-)

Compression:  Checked it, yes?

Spark: You had a bad plug once, try flopping in another new plug and new
wire.  If it is another bad plug, tho, then I wonder what is going on in
the ignition.  Something is eating your #2 plugs!  are you burning points?
replaced your condensor lately?

As a last resort, take it to a shop and have them pull the muffler and
put an EGA up the heater box pipe on each side.  See if the exhaust gas on
both sides has the same O2 level.  That will tell you if it is spark plug
not firing (exhaust will be rich) or if the injector is fouled (exhaust
will be lean).
