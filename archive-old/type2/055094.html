Subject: Re: CDI - yeah

&gt; I think I'm starting to like CDI.  Is this what the 80 vanagons use
&gt; because I was checking out my dad's and I noticed it didn't have points.

No, 79 Cal buses and 80-83.5 Cal vanagons have electronic ignition. It is
not Capacitive Discharge.

&gt; Increased milage, is this true?  If so, it's another thing that I'd like
&gt; to add to my list of items to purchase!

The Cal electronic ignition will give you better efficiency of the ignition
system. The coil output will always be at maximum. With new, clean points
coil output will be high but degrades as the points get dirty. Secondary
coil output is relative to primary voltage. The Cal system has no parts to
wear because nothing touches. Dwell and timing never changes. As the rubbing
block on points wear, dwell increase and timing retards.

&gt;
&gt; Anyone have recommendations as to what kind of system would work well on
&gt; my 76 2000FI?  Does bosch make a system that is better or do the
&gt; aftermarket ones work as well?

The Cal system is a drop-in replacement if you get all the parts :
distributor, coil, module w/heatsink, and harness.
I may have enough pieces around to make 2 sets... :)

I am not familiar with the Tiger unit but if it is like the early 70's
Mercedes system that used points.....we had lots of problems until MB came
out with totally electronic distributors. The CD unit used very low voltage
across the points. It was not enough to burn off residue and keep the points
clean. We had to drill a vent hole in the side of the dist. cap to make the
points last. The oil fumes in the crankcase would go up the dist. shaft and
coat the points, since the cap was the highest point. Drilling a hole
allowed the fumes to vent, instead of lingering.
