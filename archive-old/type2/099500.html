Subject: RE: [T2] Upgrading to H4s

Just what was on hand and available. I figured 1 30 AMP relay per filament 
was enough.... &lt;grin&gt;

30 amp relay for a 6 amp load or so...

&gt;Sounds like overkill, but a good setup powering the headlamp circuits
&gt;idividually.
&gt;
&gt;Why did't you use 40 amp relays though?

I figure a side benefit is that the headlight switch and the column toggle 
(high beam / low beam lever) will last damn near forever this way. Someday, 
around the 600k mile mark for my Westy, these may become hard to get. This 
way I might make 1 million miles before I have to replace anything related 
to the headlights....

Of course we won't be able to buy gasoline at that point...
