A dab of silicone on the underside of the engine or hood, directly on each
pin as it sticks through also does the job. If you are careful and do a tidy
job, it looks great. Last time I checked the rubber plugs to do it right
were ridiculously overpriced. Since my daily driver is anything but pristine
 the silicone worked great for me, and after 10 years is still doing a great
job.

HTH,

Courtney

Subject: [T2] VW emblem anchors

 

&gt;replacing it with an emblem? I've removed it but the holes are way too big

&gt;for the emblem &quot;anchors.&quot; Is this normal? Are there some other mounts to

use

&gt;for the emblem in this case or is it not possible to use the same holes?

 

Chris,

 

there are supposed to be rubber grommets that stick in the big holes that

the emblem sticks into. at least on my '70. I got them from Wolfsburg
