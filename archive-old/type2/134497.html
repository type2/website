Subject: Re: [T2] Cabin Heat and 72-74 NOS

I am always careful in quoting people prices on 72-74 exhaust swap by simply 
pricing the exchangers and muffler. There is also the lower and forward tin 
pieces (4), the alternator bracket the rear and front heat pipes (4) and the 
gaskets and hardware.

I have been selling used parts for bays (exclusively) for over 4 years  and 
I can tell you that all of these minor tin pieces are very hard to come by 
and very necc.

It's easy to sell someone the exchangers and muffler and even easier to send 
them somewhere else to look for these very hard to find parts.
