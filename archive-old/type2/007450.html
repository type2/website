Anybody out there partsing out a Westfalia from around '77 that might have a spare door to the overhead compartment that is right above the rear bench seat? I've always used it for clothes on camping trips. Is there anyone out there have one who's willing to ship one? I'd need the black plastic push-button handle, but I have the metal tab on the inside. I could take a pic if it's not clear what part I mean.

Thanks listees,

Ben Hirby
'77 Westy
