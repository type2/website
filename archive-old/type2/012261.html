Hi!

&gt; yup. it's a paper model of an old transporter. :) now the trick is,
&gt; from what i can tell, you need ALL of the .jpg files downloaded to
&gt; your pc, and then print them out (preferably on somewhat thick paper).

The 01.jpg ... 08.jpg are the 23 window deluxe, the s01.jpg ... s08.jpg
are the single cab, and the 0a.jpg ... 0d.jpg are the German instructions.

Very nice model from what I can see, but technically an illegal copy,
since they're copyrighted by &quot;Wilhelmshavener Modellbaubogen&quot;, who
developed them together with Volkswagen ... back in whenever. :-)
The original size, BTW, was so that the model would be in 1/20th scale,
so don't be too disappointed if you fail to complete it if you print
it on A4 paper ;-)))

Nice stuff though.  Nice pics too, especially s01.jpg and s02.jpg --
download them, if nothing else.  Thanks Jim, and Unca Joel, for
forwarding the address!

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
