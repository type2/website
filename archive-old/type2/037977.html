Subject: Clock

Hello Type 2 Listers:

Now that I've solved the oil leak (mostly) by installing new pushrod tube 
gaskets and troubleshooting the temporary non-starting problem I'd like to 
post another request.

I'd like to fix the dashboard clock on my '76 Campmobile.  It has two hands, 
12 numbers, and absolutely no digital controls.  It's been 2:47 ever since 
I've known it.  Any suggestions on where to start on repairing the works?


Thanks.

Walt Fogle
'76 Campmobile
