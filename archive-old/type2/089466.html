Subject: Re: [T2] Going back to dual Solex's

I don't think you'll see any performance improvement myself, but you might
see a bit of gas mileage improvement. I tend to favor the stock setups
anyway, and if it was up to me, it would be fuel injected from a later bus.
But the dual solexes once the synchronization is done are pretty darn
reliable. Make sure the throttle plate shafts are not worn out. Other than
that, have fun!

&gt; Guys and Gals.
&gt;
&gt; I have been thinking of converting my single Weber Progressive back to a
dual
&gt; Solex 34 pdsit. I have had one friend say it will GREATLY improve
performance
&gt; (a guy who has run single Webers, dual Carbs and FI on 914's) and another
&gt; friend who says it won't matter that much (a guy who has run buses both
type 4
&gt; and 1600 style, Bajas and Vanagons). Any thoughts?
