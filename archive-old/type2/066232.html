Paul, 

Yer right!  I think I conflated the second fight and his death from
&quot;Eaters of the Dead&quot; with his second fight and (separate, by dragon bite)
death in the original. OTOH, having looked, I cannot find a copy of any
of the three books.  I *know* I own at least one of each and at least 2
different &quot;Beowulf&quot;s.  So I am flying strictly on memory and these days,
it is only compressing in the 90's.  Damn! What a PITA!
