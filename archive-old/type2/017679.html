Subject: Source for a 1971 bus owners manual?
Message-ID: &lt;3714E898.1A54_at_worldnet.att_dot_net&gt;

Hello All,

I am having some posting problems, so bear with me if something like
this appears twice.

Does anyone know of a source for a '71 bus owners manual?  A reprint
would be fine or even a photocopy of all the pages.  If photocopied, I
would pay copying and postage.

Thanks, 
Lauria Watts
