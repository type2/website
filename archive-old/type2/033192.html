Subject: Westy Floor - plan coming!

Volks,

I have gotten a couple requests that I measure the floor pieces in the
basement.  I promise, I will later in the week.  In the mean time, as I
pulled them out, there was a micrometer handy so here are the thicknesses
(very approximate, especially for the carpet :-):

fibreboard - .5&quot;
hardboard -- .17&quot;
carpet ----- .3

Now in my limited experience (correct me if I am wrong), westy's before
1974 had a vinyl floor.  Westies from 1974 on has a carpet floor  The
plans I will be making are from a floor taken from a 1974, so the cutout
placement will vary for other years, but the overall dimensions should be
accurate.
