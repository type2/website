Subject: please help with coil?

   Hi, I'm still concerned about burning my points out again. I have 
read from the old posts but still don't understand how to test my coil. 
I put in a new Bosch Blue coil and burned out a set of points.(don't 
know if it had anything to do with the new coil or not). My tach jumps 
around still as well. I put new connectors all around to eliminate that 
possibility. I am leaving on a road trip next Fri. and want to make sure 
that everything will be good.
  What I have checked; ( I don't know the difference between primary and 
secondary) but when I unplug everything, and check between the little 
negative terminal (on the coil)and the little positive terminal, I get 
3.8 Ohms. I have an old black coil, and on that one I get 3.3 Ohms. 
,that is, connecting the 2 wires from my tester between those terminals.
  Then, with it running, I checked the voltage, negative probe to the 
engine(ground) and positive probe to the negative terminal of the coil, 
there is7.3 volts, between engine and positive terminal, there is 13.6 
volts.
  Does this appear normal?  Can anyone tell me, with these measurements, 
if this new coil has a resistor in it?
  I can take a spare everything with me on the road trip but would 
rather leave knowing that it is good from the start.
  Thanks in advance!
