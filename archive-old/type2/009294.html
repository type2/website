Hmmm- in a nutshell: have been: butcher (in parent's establishment);
nursery/landscaping; cashier/stocker;  orchestral musician ( still do
thant)...Army Bandsman (Vietnam too); biology teacher; histologist, (do it
on consulting basis with SO, and inventor (sold thousands of TRIOPS bike
mirrors, now make instrument supports for oboe, clarinet).   Started with a
Westy in 1971, learned to do all my own work when I couldn't afford the
dealer costs as a grad student!  Went all over country in '76.  Rebuilt its
engine twice; then got 78 Westy with 60 K on it in '85; it's now  at
201,550 with NO engine rebuild.  Contracted my own house and garage;
already wish I built a bigger one!
