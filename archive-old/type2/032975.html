I've been a Master Marine Tech. and VW fan for over 15 years, and have had 
great results in applying marine technology to Vee Dub's. The best &quot;shut off 
valve&quot; I've found is called an Anti-Siphon Valve in marine parlance. Fits 
ahead of the fuel filter. Available with threads in metric or standard, and 
also barbed versions. Hell, I think our local Wally World even stocks 'em!
