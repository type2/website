&gt; They are &quot;C&quot; load rating, which is what is specked by VW.  That's 1435 lbs

The letter load ratings vary with the tire size.  The VW came with 185R14
tires in load range &quot;C&quot; (actually, it was probably a european &quot;commerical&quot;
suffix rating) which were rated at 1540 pounds.  In order to get this
load-carrying capacity in 195/75R14, you need to go to load range D.

&gt; A &quot;D&quot;
&gt; rating is around 1700 lbs per tire, and I'm not sure I know of any proper
&gt; fitting tires in the &quot;D&quot; rating, other than the Michelin Agelis 61, which
&gt; doesn't seem to be available this side of the Atlantic.

Bridgestone RD603V, 185R14, load range C or D (go for D), available at any
Firestone emporium.  Drop on by, they'll probably be glad for the business
these days!
 
&gt; Note also that Truck tires are loaded at 91% of actually carrying load,
&gt; whereas car tires are rated at 100% of carrying load.  So a &quot;C&quot; rated truck
&gt; tire, actually has 10% reserve, which is about another 140 lbs capacity.
&gt; Put another way, a truck tire (ie LT) at 1435 lbs capacity is equivelant to
&gt; a car tire at 1575, approx.

Don't play games with safety margins with German engineering!  The Germans
design much closer to the limit than Americans, which is why you can have
a 3000 pound vehicle capable of carrying 2000 pounds of load.  The design
works well, but isn't as forgiving of backyard engineering as your typical
C*evy!

&gt; Reinforced?  Yes, its a 6 ply.  Passenger car tires are 3 or sometime ply.

This is the ply rating.  Most passenger car tires are rated 4-ply, but
only have one ply in the sidewalls and three under the tread.  Truck tires
are rated 6 or 8 ply, but have 3 or 4 in the sidewall, and 5 or 6 under
the tread.  The reason for the difference between the ratings and the
actual plys is that the ratings are based upon the strength of cotton ply
material.  Modern materials (nylon, rayon, kevlar, fiberglass, steel) are
a lot stronger so fewer plys are needed for the same strength.

&gt; Even the beefy Bridgestone Dueler A/T in 195/75R14 is a &quot;C&quot; class tire at
&gt; 1435 lbs per tire.

And not strong enough for a VW bus!
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the feedback.  The tire is made by Uniroyal and, assuming quality
&gt; and specs are as represented, it is proper size and load rating for VW vans.

Sorry, but no.  The proper size is 185R14, and the proper load rating is
1540 pounds or greater regardless of the ply rating letter.  In my
experence, it pays to spend the extra time to seek out the proper size and
rating.  

The &quot;expert&quot; at the tire store is usually more interesting in
selling you something that he has in stock than in getting the correct
fitment for your bus.  They also tend to underestimate the weight of a VW
bus, since it _is_ a VW and since the tire size is relatively small.  I've
had several &quot;experts&quot; recommend passenger tires for my bus, and I _know_
(from hard experience) that they aren't what the bus needs!
