Sounds like you need some valve work. The same thing happened to my 1982 Vanagon. It knocked loudly when you first started it in the morning, then it would go away after a few minutes. The mechanic took the head off, and noticed the worn valves. The engine _at_ the time had 156,000 original miles on it. Good luck with yours, and yes, it was an expensive repair.

 Hi there everyone, I'm new to the list. Thought i
havw been reading it for a few weeks now. just got
back from a cross country trip in a 2000 toyota mr2
spyder. VW is missing out here. but thats another
story. I got home and decided to take my 79' westy out
to the local campground and relax. Well heres were my
problem occured, the van has been sitting a few weeks
and so i decided to turn it over via the start switch
installed in back, w/the coil unplugged I turned the
engine over a few times to pre lube it. no peculier
noises then. but when i started it up w/ the coil
hooked up it sounded horribble a very loud knocking
sound that didnt seem like it was going away so I shut
her down. What is it thats wrong. It made noise in the
past at start up but quite very quickly within a
minute
as oil pressure built up. I beleive the latter to be
normal. Any help or insight would be greatly
appreciated! Im afraid a rebuild will probably have to
be added to my to do list:( Thanks for reading and
thanks for any help.
