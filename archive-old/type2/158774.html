Subject: Costa Rica

Hey Folks,
Just got back from Costa Rica.  I was able to see  4 buses, talk to one
owner, through a interpreter, and get a picture of her with her bus.
heeheeee, she could not for the life of her, understand why I wanted a
picture of her in front of a beat up ole' bus.  She said she brought the one
from the Factory to her home.  Some things I noticed.. I could not find the
VIN tag on the dash, of any of them???  The 75 had a trip meter, is this
rare on a 75 VDO?  What appeared to be a 71, had the rear apron, but had
bigger rear lights..perhaps a 72?
So I also learned the ultimate road trip.... The Pan-American highway will
take you all the way from Alaska to Costa Rica, and perhaps beyond!!!  Now
that is an adventure waiting to happen.  My wife says I would never make it
past the Bandito's of Mexico or Nicaragua.  None the less, it is fun to
think about.

Any one on the list from South Central Costa Rica?
