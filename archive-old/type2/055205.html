Marko G sends:

&gt; I don't have another woodruff key, so i dunno if it'll stay if i put it all
&gt; back (i doubt it).  will AVP's warranty cover this?? or will they give me
&gt; some runaround about improper installation. the engine has less than 200
&gt; miles on it. can i have a machinist try to fix it?? will i have to tear the
&gt; whole engine down??  please tell me i'm not up sh*t's creep without even a
&gt; turd for a paddle. It'll be bad enough even if they DO replace my longblock.

You're not completely up that creek, but close. I hope you have another car
for right now...

Half the keyway is gone. It's machined into some seriously hard metal, so
those things don't just break without provocation. Call AVP and ask them
their position--because it sounds to me like you had a crack in the crank.

To get to this you need to tear down the whole engine.
