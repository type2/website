Subject: Buses by the Bridge VII

  Just to let you all know that the Buses by the Bridge web site is up and
running, with info, times, location, etc. 
   -A special thanks to Rich Barker for building the site and to Bryant  of
Buskateirs fame for hosting it and to Stephen computer man for working on
getting the mail server up and going. Also to all of you that come to the
