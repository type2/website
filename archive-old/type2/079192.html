Subject: Re: [T2] ADMINS: downtime (Backup list started)

Sorry, wasn't aware of it.  I emailed admins
awhile back and didn't get a response.  Sorry for
assuming there was not a temporary list already. 
I will remove the list I started and send emails
to anyone who joined to join instead this list

&gt; &gt; I took the liberty of starting a backup list
&gt; for
&gt; &gt; when our server is down.  It is intended to
&gt; be
&gt; &gt; used only when the main list is down.  Join
&gt; if
&gt; &gt; you want to be able to stay in touch while
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; list is down.  It is public access.  There
&gt; are no
&gt; &gt; controls over who joins or posts. 
&gt; Vanagon_dot_com
&gt; &gt; list had one of these and it served us well.
