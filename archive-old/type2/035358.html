Subject: Re: Ruminations on heating a VW bus

&gt;

ok, this thread may be dead and gone for all i know, im just getting to this 
message though- anyhow, the safety issue may be a non-issue after all...i 
know for a fact the mercedes w123 series (240d, 300d, 280e, et al) had, as 
an option, a seat heater, and their seats are of similar composition (MBTEX 
spread over horsehair pad, on a spring frame)...it shouldnt be too hard to 
pull the coils and re-install them in a bus seat, if youre looking for them 
in boneyards, youll most likely find them on the 300D, as that was the more 
&quot;upscale&quot; of the series (i cant vouch for the gas powered ones) and as such 
had more of the options installed. good luck finding this option though, ive 
been looking for it for some time to retrofit to my 240D, and ive only seen 
it once, in a 300d in a boneyard in tx. i didnt have the money, and the guy 
wouldnt let go of the coils unless i bought the entire seats. but, yes, if 
you find the coils, as they live with horsehair seats in their stock 
configuration, they should work fine in a bus seat.

&gt;One other idea on heating...
&gt;
&gt;It may be possible to put some of those modern electrically heated (front)
&gt;seats into a bus from a modern vehicle.  (I wouldn't do it myself - I'd
&gt;rather keep the stock ones.)

-snip-


(Obviously there are safety
&gt;implications - all that VW horse-hair style padding may not mix with
&gt;electricity too well !?)  But some brave soul might like to try it.
