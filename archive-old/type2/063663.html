&gt;OK, my question is: is this all true? What have other peoples experiences
&gt;been with this engine, and should I go back to the proper heads or just
&gt;write this whole thing off to experience and send this bus on its merry way?

1. Calm down. By far, the Vanagon owners are the most self-satisfied people
on this list, and by *all* accounts the air-cooled Vanagon is superior in
every mechanical respect to the two earlier generations of bus. There are
people (including me) who prefer an earlier bus, but this is because of
aesthetics and prejudice and _ethos_, not engineering. Save for the
Porsche, you have in your hands the most sophisticated air-cooled
automobile ever produced on this planet. They aren't making any more of
them. Don't piss it away because somebody *told* you it's not a good truck.

2. Send off and get the proper heads from Mark Stephens. Somebody correct
me if I'm wrong, but to my knowledge there is no recorded instance on this
list or v_at_l of a Mark Stephens head dropping a seat. Ever. Even in the 1980
Vanagon. ;)

3. The notion that engines run hot because they have hydraulic lifters
and/or oxygen sensors is so laughable that I'm not even going to debate it.
If you are convinced that this is true and wish to unload the bus for
cheap, I'm your man! Sell it to me. Throw me in the briar patch. ;)
