Subject: Re: horn and brake lights are linked

Back in highschool a buddy and I picked up his beetle from the shop in which
he had some electrical work done. Before dropping it off the horn did not
work so we tested this when we got on the freeway. The horn still did not
work. As we approached the offramp he signaled to make his first right since
we picked it up and wouldn't you know it - the left turn indicator didn't
work. . . but we got a nice &quot;Beep. . . Beep. . . Beep. . . Beep. . .&quot; from
the horn.


&gt;Moral: if your horn stops working, your brake lights
&gt;might also be dead and you might make other drivers
&gt;angry. Fix it soon.
