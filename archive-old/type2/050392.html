Subject: Re: [T2] Flywheel Removal 

Chad,

A breaker bar and socket are fine for removal, a torque wrench is
*required* for installation (you don't want that pup to come loose in
there!!!).  A flywheel lock of some sort is indeed necessary for
removal and installation.  You can buy one at any VW flaps, or make one
from a 4' length of angle iron.  drill the angle iron to accept clutch
bolts and have a second person hold it or prop it against the floor.
