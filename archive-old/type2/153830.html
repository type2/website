Subject: Barn Door in the Attic?

I heard a rumour about someone piecing together a Vanagon in the basement 
recently.... and I could have sworn there was a web site showing a Early bus 
being resurected in someones attic....
Can anyone help me out ,,, or was I dreaming about a Barn Door bus in the 
attic. ??  I couldn't find anything in the type2 archives... but maybe I was 
searching wrong.
