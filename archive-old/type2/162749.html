Subject: ADMIN: Recent PayPal phishing emails

All,

Recently, both the VintageBus and Type2 lists have gotten a few
&quot;phishing&quot; emails, purportedly from PayPal.  The admins have removed
the subscriptions that were allowing these emails to make it to the
lists, and are working on ways to prevent a reoccurence.

In general, no legitimate company will send you an email that requests
you to log in and &quot;confirm&quot; or &quot;validate&quot; your account number, password,
PIN, etc.  If you're not sure, look up the company's phone number on
your own (don't use a number presented in a suspicious email) and call
the company yourself to verify the request for information.

Thanks!

Matt Roberds
