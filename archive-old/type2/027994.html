&gt;David: What is the maxiumum voltage of the  pulse on an injector?  Is it
&gt;within range of an ordinary scope? Does one simply  clip a lead onto the
&gt;injector terminal and display the 12V pulse on the scope?

Jack,
  I would guess that it is a 12VDC square wave (of sorts).  Duration/frequency of the wave will be dependent on operating speed/conditions (hence the need for syncronization).  There may be some &quot;spikey&quot; edges to the wave but it shouldn't be that far off.  I'd suggest making up a &quot;T&quot; jumper that goes in between the harness and the injector to provide a connection point (rather than trying to reach into the existing plug with the boot pulled back).  Shouldn't be a problem with polarity either - hooking it up backwards would show a negative-going wave versus positive.  Just reverse the scope leads.
