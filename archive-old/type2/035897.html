Of late? Karl has been the primo guy for my education (and parts) for about 
2 1/2 years now. He's the main reason we have ONLY V-dubbs now..7 of them. 
OTOH, if it weren't for Karl, we'd prolly be driving one of those neat SUK's 
by now...hmmmmm

PS I'll be posting details on a free a/c unit (dealer installed type with 
the nifty factory appearing below-dash piece) which will only require the 
belt to be replaced, and possibly a compressor rebuild..it is complete..to 
be picked up in central florida.(making room in the garage to get a welder 
near the KG :(
