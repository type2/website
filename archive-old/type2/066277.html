Subject: '74 bus

Hello all. I recently bought a 74 bus with &lt; 48 k miles. It had been parked
for twelve years. The sellers had someone change the
oil,gasoline,plugs,points,etc.in hopes of starting it. It apparently ran
for about 20 seconds. Long enough for one piston to crash into one stuck
valve. Bad things ensued. With the help of a friend the engine is out and
partially disassembled. I'm left with 3 good barrel assembles, 3 good
connecting rods, one bent [slightly] rod, possibly metal particles passed
through oil pump, intact crankcase, one good head, [one destroyed] and one
otherwise very clean bus. My question is, wouldn't it be better to rebuild
&quot;this&quot; engine rather than trade the core and get an engine that perhaps has
a million miles on it  before rebuild? The cylinder walls still have cross
hatching and it's very clean inside and out. No oil leaks. Problem is the
approximately $1800. estimate I got. Either way, about the same price. Is
this high for a rebuild even if I take it out and put it back in? In
Portland, Or. there are only a few VW mechanics. None of my friends know
anything about aircooled engines so not much help here. I haven't even
driven this veewee yet and I love it! It's so clean and straight. Only
needs a muffler. [and rebuild] Btw, could it be that this mechanic charges
by the CC? Just kidding. Anyway, all help would be appreciated.

Cynthia
