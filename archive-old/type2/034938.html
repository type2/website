Subject: Stalling - Aux Air Valve

This is just info for folks with fuel injected busses (mine is a '79). Often
there are posts about busses that stall. The little rubber elbow, which is
attached to the aux air valve for the hose that leads to the big air input
tube (next to the AFM), cracked and broke.
The symptoms were:
1) 1st day, my bus stalled twice during my 20 mile trip to daycare and back.
The stalls occured at the first 2 traffic lights that I came to, and then
normal driving.
2) The 2nd day I had 4 or 5 stalls over the same trip.
3) The 3rd day I stalled everytime I came to a stop. I could not get the bus
to idle at all without stepping on the gas. This of course forced me to take
action. A half dozen stalls I can tolerate, but not every stop sign.

At night, I flipped through my Bosch fuel injection manual and the trouble
shooting guide downloaded from the type II library. I decided to check my
vacuum hoses, and then the aux air valve. 30 minutes of reading, and 5
minutes checking hoses, and voila, the cracked elbow was found and I was
back in business. I taped the elbow together to make sure that was the
problem, then drove to my FLAPS and bought 3 elbows so I have them for next
time.

QUESTIONS:
Has anybody tryed soldering/brazing on a metal elbow to the aux air valve
instead of using the rubber elbow? I think the vibration/stress/preload at
the rubber elbow is causing it to fail; this is the second time for me in 3
years. I have a stiff plastic tube that runs from the aux air valve to the
air intake boot. Is this normal? Can I replace it with a more flexible
braided hose instead?
