Subject: Re: [T2] New concept van in Michelin Challenge with bus feel

While we are on the subject of VW history, I have a couple of questions.
William Bushnell Stout built the Stout Scarab in 1935. I suspect that the
Beetle
and the Splittie were inspired by Stout's work. The similarities seem like
more than coincidence
to me. However, I have never seen this discussed anywhere. Have any of you
seen Stout and Porsche's designs compared anywhere? Could someone recommend
some good reading on VW history?
Thanks,

&amp;gt;HIstory records that Porsche was going to settle with Tatra but Hitler fobid
him from doing so &amp;gt;&amp;gt;and solved the legal problems by invading Czechoslovakia
