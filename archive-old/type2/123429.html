Subject: RE: [T2] noise when starting heater

Hi Richard,

I never tried to disassemble my blower motor, I just bought a new tunnel 
blower and scrapped the original VW setup.  I hooked up a new switch, 
blocked up the old ducts, and re-engineered a better location for the 
blower.  VW did a lot of things really well when designing our Buses, but I 
think they did pretty poorly with the blower fan.  Of course, by 1978 they 
were probably deep into final designs for the Vanagon, and they just didn't 
have as much left in the budget for updates to the Bus.

I'm sure there are decent blower fans available in junkyards, but unless 
you're looking to get your Bus back to 100% stock (for better or worse), I 
don't know that it's worth your time to search for the *right* one.

Good luck!
