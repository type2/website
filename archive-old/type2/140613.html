Subject: Re: [T2] garage door height?

Just a word of warning, I have gone through the same process recently when 
buying my new garage. One big trap is a lot of manufacturers quote a door 
FRAME size, but the actual height you get once the door is installed is 
lower (and narrower), some up to 3&quot; lower than the frame (and 4&quot; narrower).
The one I bought has the door guides etc inside the frame so you get the 
full opening. I went over board and got a door 7'10&quot; high so I can load the 
roof rack in the garage :).
