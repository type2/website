&gt;if you have in mind a desire to pay-learn with a mechanic, 1) they provide
inexpensive &gt;evening classes in small groups on tune-up, brakes, and general
understanding of &gt;air-cooled vw's, and; i hung out there in the early 90's when
i either lived on a hill, or &gt;worse. visitors to the city should know about them
too. dead-head sensitive owner
&gt;and staff. several girl mechanics and instructors. very guru, kine, and
crunchy.

When I was living in SF in 1990, I enrolled in a class at City College Harrison
ST. Annex
called &quot;VW Mechanics&quot; met once a week at night. Tuition was $5 per semester.
Taught by
Frank, the father of the dead show Gumby.He would encourage you to bring your vw
into class
and we'd throw it up on the lift and he'd lecture us in the shop. The other half
of the
time we'd be in a classroom looking at overheads of Solex's, etc.- The class was
half-filled with transients who slept in their buses around the city at night. I
wonder if
anyone else on the list remembers that class?
