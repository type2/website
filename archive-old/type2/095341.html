Subject: Highway Speed Oil Pressure

Dear List,

I have an 82 air cooled vanagon, stock fuel injected engine minus the EGR 
system (PO modification) and running Pertronix instead of points (101,000 
mi).  I've installed VDO Oil Pressure, Oil Temp (in the sump plate), and 
cyclinder head sensors(under #3 spark plug).  Running this setup for about a 
year I've notice the following oil pressure trends:

(Oil: Castrol 20W50 dino changed every 3 months or so.)

Cold startup pressure: 60 - 70 psi (depending on ambient temp).

Idle pressure when oil temp reads 180 is about 10-12 psi.  When hot (oil 
temp 200-220), idle pressure is about 7 psi.  My warning light has not 
turned on when running or at idle (except on startup - the blub works!)

Highway speed (55 mph) WINTER oil pressure is 40 - 30 psi when oil temp is 
180-200, respectively.

Highway speed SUMMER oil pressure is 30 - 20 psi when oil temp is 200 - 220, 
respectively.

CHT is about 300 at idle, 350-375 at highway speeds, has gotten as high as 
450 on climbs in the Cascades.  I've never seen anything higher than this.  
All of the temps and pressures above have remained constant over the past 
year.

I believe my bearings and oil pump are worn but I'm not sure if these 
numbers mean that they are excessively worn to the point of needing a 
rebuild.  I believe I read that VW set the running oil pressure warning 
light at 13 psi for the water cooled 2.1L engines.  Is this a good reference 
point to use for the air cooled engine?  Or - if my highway speed oil 
pressure goes to less than 20 - do a rebuild no matter what?

I'm planning to do my first compression test soon - just to see what numbers 
I get - but I don't expect to find abnormally low readings (based on general 
good performance).  If my top end is holding up - how much should I worry 
about my low highway speed oil pressures?  Should I consider a rebuild now? 
or just wait until I drop a valve seat and then do everything at once.

Any opinions or past experiences would be appreciated.

Thank you.
Kevin
