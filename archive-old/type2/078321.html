Check... correct!

&gt; I didn't install these when i buttoned up my solid lift 1800 with the 2bbl

And you should not have with that carb/intake... the thin metal gaskets
pass heat from the head to the intake  manifold, the phenolic  do not (as

can get to get to the runners (won't help much, but may help some with
carb icing)
