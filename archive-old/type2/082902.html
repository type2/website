&gt; &gt; That is too high from my experiences.  I like my oil in the 180-210 range.
&gt; &gt; Even at 210 it violates the &quot;cannot hold the dipstick for 3 seconds&quot; rule.

&gt; I have no idea what temp the VW engineers designed the oil to run at.
&gt; But water boils at 212F. At slightly lower temps does the moisture in
&gt; the oil start to change to a vapor state? (george?) Or will it need to
&gt; rise to water's sea level boiling point? I feel better knowing that
&gt; the oil is getting hot enough to burn off any moisture from
&gt; condensation.

You do not have to run 212+F to get rid of the water from the oil.
Watercooled cars typically run 180F thermostats and evaporate the water
just fine.
