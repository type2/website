Subject: sliding door latch

hey all! well, at the &quot;gathering&quot; last week, i found out how the sliding
door latch is supposed to close and then i found out why mine doesn't. its
broke! anyway, to those that know, which years are the same so i can swap?
mines a 71 with one cable and one rod. cable opens and the rod closes. and
on a sad note..i went to my favorite junk yard the other day and they had
crushed the 6 or 7 busses they had!!! dang dude! very quiet around here with
no tunes~ :-)
