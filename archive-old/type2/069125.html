Subject: Re: 75 westy parts..

Hi David,

 Among the Westy parts you have... is there the table that goes in the 
driver's cabin and the trash container/storage box (bench seat)? If so I 
would like to buy them. Please send me a reply telling the condition of 
these items and the price. This will finally complete the restoration of 
my Westy. I live in Puerto Rico, just for reference. 
Best regards,
