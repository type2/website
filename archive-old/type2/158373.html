Subject: [Q] Seats &amp; Glass

Greetings Group,

I have some questions that fall under the &quot;safety&quot; category.

Seats
I'm considering changing out the front seats of my '71 Camper -- maybe even
the small, rear-facing seat too.  I am interested in putting in high-back
seats (actually, any seat with a headrest/neck support).  Are there any
suggestions from the group on where to look?  I'm probably going to want to
keep the original seats so I can put the Camper back to its original state,
but this is not necessarily set in stone (trade deals, anyone?).

Glass
I have *no* idea whether the glass in my Camper is original, and whether it
is &quot;safety&quot; glass.  I would like to be able to tell.  Anyone know of a way?
I want to have safety glass in the Camper and wouldn't mind selling the
existing (original?) glass to get there.  Suggestions?

Kind Regards,
David
