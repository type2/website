I got in on the end of a post that was arguing the merits of new parts
vs. used parts recovered from salvage yards.

I just wanted to put my two cents worth in.

Of the six people I know that are driving VW vans of various years, would
not have them on the road today if they had to make repairs exclusively
with new parts.

They are all very conscientious about safety and always buy new engine,
brake, shocks, clutch, bearings and steering parts new from parts
dealers. 

However with probably 20,000 parts on a van it is not always practical to
buy new parts.

But things like transmissions, heat exchangers, catalytic converts,
heater blowers, windshield wiper motors, door locks, window glass, vent
windows, turn signals, headlight switches, wiper arms etc. why not buy
used parts that test out OK?

I think I've kept my 83 Westfalia almost 100% VW original with the use of
used parts and of all the used parts I've installed over the last seven
years the only used part that has failed was an electric fuel pump.

I've got a fair number of used parts on my van and I carry some used
spare parts that have been tested before I pack them for extended trips.
