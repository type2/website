Subject: re:glue

Anymouse,
     You might try 3M 5200.  Widely used in the marine industry to glue things when you absolutely never want to get them apart again, without breaking one part. Small tubes are available at the big box stores. 
     Another traditional instrumentation method is to drill through the gear and shaft and pin the two together.  Seems more difficult to do than it is in practice.  Pin doesn't have to go precisely through center.  If you locate the pin away from the wear area, i.e. where the gear engages it will be even more tolerant of imprecision.  Pin material, fine steel or brass rod, is available at hobby stores in the K&amp;S rack.
