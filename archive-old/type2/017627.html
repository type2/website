&quot;My FLAPs can't seem to get bus tranny mounts for me through any of
there suppliers ('72 bus)...and I can't find them listed anywhere. I
don't have the part for the front one (technically a transmission
hanger, I think), but the back ones (2) are 211 599 431. I need all
three if I can get them, but I'll settle for the back. One of my rear
mounts is broken, so I NEED it bad.&quot;

If memory serves, there are five bits of rubber holding the Engine/Trans
unit in the late bus: two for the carrier at the rear of the engine
(rear is rear), two at the rear of the transmission, and one at the nose
of the trans.  I know thost two at the rear of the engine are easy to
find.  Are you looking for the front trans mount, or the rear ones?  And
are yours damaged/missing, or just old and worn.  I wouldn't be
surprised if the trans mounts (front &amp; rear) are VW dealer only items,
new.  Used, anyone (like myself) who's scrapped a few busses shoul have
them.
