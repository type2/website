Hi Volks,

I attended the June Jitterbug VW Show on the weekend and saw a really 
strange looking carb on the T4 engine that was pushing one of the dune 
buggies shown. The engine was originally D-Jet FI, but this carb was a 
strange one, sitting on top of a aluminum box between the frame rails.

Anyone seen one of these before?

The rest of my pics from the weekend's campout and some show pictures 
are online here:
