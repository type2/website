Hi Dave,

Thanks to WetWesties member Vern McIntosh, I have the installation
instructions for a couple of different Corvair kits.  What year is your SC?
Do you have any clue as to whose kit is in it?  VW or Corvair trans?  Fill me
in with a few details, and I probably have what you need.

&gt; Has anyone ever owned a bus that has been converted to corvair power or
&gt; actually done a conversion?  I just bought a crew cab with a corvair engine
&gt; and trans and what to change it  back.  The thing is I don't know what has
&gt; been hacked up or not.  Can I change it back? Does anyone know what is
&gt; involved?  It does look like a lot of work.
