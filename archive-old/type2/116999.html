Subject: misses on acceleration + water from the tailpipe

&lt;On my way back from NJ to NC my bus was missing. It was like it would
sputter. It would only happen at high speeds and only when I was giving it
gas. The more gas I was giving the more likely it was to happen. It
wouldn't
do it non stop, but every couple of seconds. It was not evenly spaced.&gt;


I had the same problem on my trip this weekend to Rhode Island and back to
DC. Just before I left I set the valves, changed my oil and regapped my
points. I set them so the dwell was dead on 50. Then I set the timing and
she sounded and ran great, oil  temps were even lower than they had been.
Then after about 1 hour or so of driving I noticed the slightest sort of a
miss or hiccup. It would only do it once very quickly and not even that
strongly. It seemed to happen at cruising speeds and maybe when
accelerating but only once every 15 minutes or more. Never any loss of
power or anything just this weird little hiccup every so often. So we drove
to Newport, temps got a little high once so backed down to 65. Gas mileage
was okay I guess 16-18 mpg. No major probelms. Then on the way home last
night the hiccup got a little more frequent. Maybe once every couple of
minutes. Still no loss of power but definatley more pronounced. Then I
stopped for gas and the damn thing would not start. Never had the &quot;hot
start problem&quot; before with this bus. So we pushed it and she fired right
up. Stopped once more and had to push start. Thats a whole other problem
though. I think, and my buddy agrees that the miss is somehow ignition
related. FI is fired off the -(neg) side of the coil which is triggered by
the points right? If the points are maybe screwed up it could be tricking
the FI? I have not looked at any of this as we got in at 5am after 9.5 hour
drive last night that was preceeded by an extremely tough 2 day regatta so
I am a little beat...

But I would like to hear about anyones insight into this problem, and the
hot start one as well. I really don't want to go &quot;rigging&quot; up some relay
that VW never intended to be needed in the first place. My 72' had the same
hot start issue...
