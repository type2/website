 &quot;My 74 doesn't have a fan, and is missing the sheet metal under the engine.
Was
the fan optional? How much does the missing tin affect the heater?&quot;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is based on my'72 which also has a T4 engine. Aux blower fan is hung
from top of engine compartment. A hose comes off of each side and goes  into
the tin. It is turned on when the left heater control lever in cockpit is
pulled all the way down. It is most useful when you are sitting still And
engine RPMs are not high enough to push air thru the ducts to the front of
the bus.Has anyone tried to rig one of these T4 aux fans for an upright?

Good heat (and mine is very good) requires intact heater boxes and a leak
free ducting system to the front of the bus. Check the flaps, hoses, center
tube controls cable etc
The '72 still has the lever below the dash on the heater tube to direct air
to the foot area or the windscreen. Up is down and down is up.

Go to the junkyard and find all of the tin that you are missing; thermostat
and control flaps too. Get the correct engine compartment seal. This stuff
wont warm you up but it will keep you engine cool and keep those nasty
exhaust fuse out of the passenger compartment. 

Those vents to the engine compartment dont just ram sir into the engine
compartment.  The compartment must be sealed so that the fan creates
negative pressure which draws fresh air in. Let's here from all you science
teachers on this one:)&gt;

Hope you stay warn and dry!
