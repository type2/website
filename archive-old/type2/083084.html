Subject: RE: STOCK DUAL CARBS TO PORSCHE 1700 L-JET FI CONVERSION QUESTIONS???

&gt;chance to acquire a complete Porsche 1.7 L-Jet FI system.

I'm assuming you're referring to a 914 FI system?  The 70-74 1.7 used d-Jet, 
the 73-76 2.0 used d-Jet, and the 75-76 1.8 used L-Jet.  So you need to re-
evaluate what you're looking at.  The 914 L-Jet is virtually identical to the 
bus L-Jet.  The d-jet is an entirely different animal.  Either can be used, but 
you need to know which one you're dealing with.  Technically speaking, the L-
Jet is a newer, more advanced system than the d-Jet.

&gt;what else would I need to convert from the stock dual carbs 
&gt;to this FI system?

You'll need a gas tank with a fuel-return inlet.  So you'll need to find one 
from a 76-79 bus (maybe Steve Dolan's recent acquistion??).  You'll need to tap 
your cylinder head above #3 for the head temp sensor.  Other than that, you 
just need EVERYTHING from the donor FI - wiring harness, all 
sensors/senders/relays, brain, fuel pressure regulator, fuel rails, injectors, 
distributor - everything.  You'll need seveal yards of FI-rated fuel line in 
the correct size.  You'll need various lengths/sizes of vacuum hose.  You can 
tie the whole system in with a few electrical connections here and there.  And 
of course, you'll have to figure out how/where to mount the other components.

&gt;Will the stock vacuum advance dizzy work with this FI?

If you're looking at a d-Jet system, you HAVE to have a distributor from a d-
Jet system.  There is a set of trigger points mounted low in the body of the 
dizzy that sends signals to the ECU to fire the injectors.  If it's indeed an L-
Jet FI, you'd still be better off using the correct dizzy for the FI system, 
but you can get by with your old one.

&gt;I have an electric fuel pump from a F_at_RD Pick up. Can I just 
&gt;use a regulator with this fuel pump?

There's been talk that a particual Ford (Ranger?) FI pump will work just fine 
as a replacement, but you'll need to use the correct pressure regulator from 
the FI system.  The old d-Jet systems use a fixed regulator that you adjust to 
30 PSI.  The L-Jet, if I'm not mistaken, uses a vacuum-controlled regulator so 
you have more pressure when your engine is being asked for more power (a better 
setup if you ask me).

Bottom line, find out what kind of FI you're looking at and you can get more 
precise answers.
