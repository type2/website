Subject: Re: [T2] More info about Voltage regulator

Hiya Jim,

1.  In a stock set-up it is mounted on the firewall just behind the stock air 
filter.  Assuming your old engine is still in place, you're going to have to 
remove the air filter to see that location.  It's just this (engine) side of 
the pass-through hole for the lead from the battery to the starter.

2.  Yes.  The VR from your 74 Beetle is set up for an alternator only system 
and since that is what you are installing your old VR (the one currently in 
the Bus) won't do the job for you.

3.  Try finding a copy of Robert Bentley's Official VW Service Manual.  Ought 
to be a picture or two plus wiring diagrams to suit your needs.
