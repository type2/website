Subject: anyone have a spare door handle?

Thanks to a few folks, I have
the door handle off and sitting
on my desk. Does anyone have a spare
that they'd like to sell?
 
It's the kind of part that screams 
&quot;go to the junkyard&quot; to me, but I don't
have one within 100 miles.
 
Plan B is to buy a new one, but I find
something fundamentally wrong about that ;)
 
gotta get back to the holiday....
