Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Pressure Sender

Hello,

In my Bently, It states that the stock oil pressure
sender is to be tightened hand tight. It says that
there is no specified torque for it. That doesn't help
does it? Sorry. Have a great day!

Regards,

David Kelly

&gt; Hi people,
&gt; 
&gt; I haven't been able to find a published torque spec
&gt; for the oil pressure
&gt; sender on my '77 T4 engine.  It's NPT, so I'm
&gt; nervous.  Anybody care to
&gt; estimate about how much torque?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
