Subject: Re: My last OT word on ibuprofen for burns
References: &lt;f5.bc84090.2869492c_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Regarding my using ibuprofen (I spelled it wrong in subject) in a
home-made paste for burns, I have been told it is available in a paste
form.  Don't know if it is OTC.  I doubt you can overdose systemically
this way.  The effects of the *profens as non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory agents is well know, and the paste idea is to get the
effect to the target site without having too much in the body. (the 3
tablets you take orally after the burn helps for more than just the
pain). The use of cold (ice, ie) also blocks pain and lessens the
inflammatory response by limiting blood flow that brings the
inflammatory cells.
   BTW, C.F. mentioned popping the blister, which is not a good idea if
the skin is not broken, as it can let bacteria in.  The blister will
lessen if the burn is left to air dry.  Mine has receded in areas to
appear as normal skin.  If a blister is in the way, then sterile
procedures should be followed to create a pinhole and then some kind of
band-aid applied.  MB 78 VW Camper    MUTS oboe support
