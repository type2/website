Andy,

I totally agree with Rich, this is a *not* part to skimp on.
Your life depends on it....

As my sons were getting ready to get &quot;into&quot; paintball, my buddy asked them
if they wanted a $10 face mask or a $40 face mask...he added &quot;what are
your eyes and face worth to you?&quot;

They choose wisely&lt;grin&gt;...I was really proud of them that day.

I don't want to read about you in the paper.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Call me alarmist, but I've had too many close calls... Anybody remember

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; has anyone ever fixed a cracked brake fluid reservoir. Is it made of
&gt; cast
&gt; nylon? is it possible to weld/melt a repair? I have a spare Im thinking
&gt; of
&gt; experimenting on. Im thinking I could plug a cheap soldering iron into a
&gt; variac and vary the temp until I got a melt without burning.
&gt; Any / all thoughts appreciated.
