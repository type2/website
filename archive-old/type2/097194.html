Subject: Re: [T2] colorful levers (was: Heating Problems)

On the '70 Westy the left and right red levers open the left and right heat
exchanger vents and the left and right green/blue levers open the left and
right vent fresh air vents.

The small knob under the front seat is there to open and close a valve that
directs warm are into the rear through a vent just under the step-down. This
is done through a curved hose under the bus. You may wish to check it, as
with buses as old as ours this hose is often broken. If this happens water
can get in and rust the valve shut and/or rust through the ducting causing
hot air loss.

Why isn't the right level coming down all the way? Check under your dash to
make sure the mechanism simply isn't bumping against something. If it isn't,
your cable may be frozen,  or the heat exchanger vent may rusted shut, or
cable may need to be adjusted.

You may wish to crawl under to inspect.

Cheers,

John Rogers

&gt; you mean the left isnt just the left vent and the right isnt just the
&gt; right one? damn, i have so much to learn about this bus! would that
&gt; explain why the right red lever only goes down about half way? if it is
&gt; supposed to go down farther, how do i adjust it? dont think i have ever
&gt; heard any motors when i play with those knobs... will test tomorrow. the
&gt; 70 has this motor?

No. It is just a cable connector.


&gt; ok, so the green knobs control the amount of fresh air? damn, someone
&gt; explain all 4 levers, please... and while we're at it, what is the small
&gt; knob on the front of the seat? (70 westy) i know the big knob adjusts the
&gt; seat so what is the other one?
&gt;
&gt; thanks!
