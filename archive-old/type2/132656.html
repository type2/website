To be fair, Don, you do live in Orange County. The rest of California 
(except maybe Marin County) is a little more open-minded.

But you do have to possess a high degree of self-esteem to drive a bus 
in So. Cal.  Here in San Diego County, busses are strongly associated 
with (1) surfers, (2) recent immigrants from Mexico, and (3) others 
considered somewhat undesirable.

However, my distaste for the vulgar choices people make by purchasing 
SUVs, unneeded pick-up trucks, and other such trash is so overwhelming 
that it easily drowns out whatever scorn they may feel for me and 
Peregrine.
