Good evening,
  Today I finally fired up my 74 westy after a ten month course of
teach-it-yourself  VWology (many thanks to the listees who have given me
advice on various topics, also to the late, great John Muir- I am the idiot
his book is there to guide) The engine is a stock 1795cc I had rebuilt at a
shop out here, and after the engine had run for about two or three minutes
this afternoon I noticed a rather alarming amount of white smoke coming
from various parts of the engine, most notably from the spark plug holes in
the cylinder head tinware on both sides of the engine. This is not exhaust
smoke, nasal analysis suggests the presence of oil, and there is a small
oil leak coming from the No. 1 cylinder exhaust port or there abouts (it
drips off of the bend in the exhaust pipe there). Is this just excess oil
burning up? The engine has sat in my garage for a few months since I got it
back and I'm wondering if the oil had pooled in certain places. The engine
was also a lot hotter than I had expected. 
  Now is this normal for the initial startup on a new engine? The carbs
haven't been balanced yet and the timing work isn't complete which I am led
to believe will reduce the engine temperature when done. However, I've put
a lot of time, love and effort into this beast, er, beauty and wondered if
I could get some feedback from the folks who've done this sort of thing
before me before I go on.
Thanks in anticipation for any advice.

Live long and perspire
