Be sure to check the wires entering the double relay and the resistor pack, they
tend to wear out and break where you can't see. Also if they've been plugged and
unplugged several times they're more prone to deteriorate. Another place to
check is the wiring to your electric FI fuel pump. There's a ground that needs
sanding and a power wire that can be exposed to the elements. decay of these
wires could cause stalling at highway speeds.
