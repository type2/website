Hi,

&quot;VOLKSWAGEN RESTORATIONS USA&quot; (Tommy) writes:

&gt;     Have you seen the movie Medicine Man, staring Sean Connery? At any
rate
&gt; at the begining of that movie there is a bus like you describe. It caught
my
&gt; attention also, and by single frame advancing my VCR you can tell it is a
&gt; radiator. So it must be water cooled.

 Sounds like a Mexican bus to me- they use an inline four with a front
mounted radiator. Check the credits for the film and I guess that you'll
find it was filmed in Costa Rica, not Brazil. It's an easier location
for Hollywood.

&gt;     Along those lines I have heard of a Brazilian water cooled bus that
&gt; use'es the inline four cylinder engine (Rabbit, Golf, Jetta, etc). I would
&gt; like to find one of those in the US. Could it be this bus?

 This is the Mexican version. They are quite widespread in Central America
and occasionally cross into the States (though they can't be imported
legally
for road use). In South America you find the Brazilian busses which use an
upright 1600cc engine. These are sold quite widely- I went and looked one
over and picked up a brochure when I was in La Paz, it was pretty cool to 
see a brand new breadloaf! You can buy these in the UK (a listee has one)
though they are pretty pricey, what with shipping &amp; so on.

 Time is moving on, so the situation may have changed, but a few years ago
VW were selling aircooled bays in South America, watercooled bays in Central
and North America, Audi engined &quot;Vanagons&quot; in South Africa and T4 
Transporters (&quot;Eurovans&quot;) in Europe, North America &amp; Australasia.

Cheers,
	 W.
