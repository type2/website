Subject: Camping Stools for '68-71

Can anyone tell me the value for camp stools, the 4 legged w/ yellow vinyl
cover variety. The time I found a dealer with two, he said one was worth
$50. to $75.00 but he wouldn't sell it, even though he had two.

The reason I am asking is that I have come into possession of two stools,
both in great condition. Since I got one that matches my interior ( a
wonderful job, David, thanks again) I don't need these. Any and all offers
will be considered.

Also, anyone going to Circle Yer Wagons? TBear

Don't take life too seriously- you'll never live through it.
