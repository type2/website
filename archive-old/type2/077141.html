&gt; &gt; Buses by the Bridge host hotel.
&gt; &gt; I have gotten a pretty decent discount for those coming to BBB VI 
and 
&gt; want
&gt; &gt; to stay in a hotel.
&gt; &gt; The island inn hotel is across the street from BBB VI and is walking
&gt; &gt; distance
&gt; 
I've stayed at the Island Inn and it was a very nice place.  My wife 
and kids liked it very much!
