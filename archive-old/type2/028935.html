Hi Eric,

On a single carb engine there is a pre-heat tube to warm the input manifold
and reduce the risk of ice forming in the input manifold; if the preheat
tube is not plumbed up properly in the replacement exhaust (one end is at a
lower pressure than the other) then there will be no cross flow of exhaust
and therefore no manifold heating.

When the brakes are applied the resistance of the gasses flowing through the
exhaust slow the engine down and because the engine is connected to the
wheels through the gearbox perform additional braking. So if a large bore
exhaust, or one which by design allows for a freer flow of the gasses is
fitted then the braking distance will be increased.

Good luck

what affect does putting a different muffler on your bus have? Do you have
to change the timing or anything.? The muffler I'm putting on has a little
hole for that long tube egr thing.._dot_can I just plug that up? I tore my tube
off long ago.
Thanks
