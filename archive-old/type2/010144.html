&gt;
&gt;Does anyone know how many amps a dometic draws? I'm looking to get a power 
&gt;converter and I need to know the amperage requirements.
&gt;

If my memory is correct.... when I played with my 77 fridge, the heater 
element drew 4.5 amps. My fridge works great, it will make ice cubes in the 
2 little ice cube trays.
