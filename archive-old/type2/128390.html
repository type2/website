&gt; Hey,
&gt;
&gt; On occassion I happen to see both Beetles and Buses being towed behind RV's
&gt; and other big vehicles.  All four wheels are on the ground and rolling at
&gt; highways speeds.
&gt;
&gt; I was always told you want to keep the drive from spinning in neutral because
&gt; the transmission would heat up over a long distances. Is this true or false?

No more than if the transmission was driving the vehicles.  Manual
transmissions are splash-lubricated, so they get enough lube to survive.
Auto gearboxes generally are pump-lubricated from the engine side (most of
them, anyway) so they don't like to be towed.
