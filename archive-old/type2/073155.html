I have had several mails from Mr. Bugzbugn_at_aol_dot_com who had some parts
stolen off of his 67 DeLuxe.

&gt;THEY TOOK THE RADIO AND SOME OF THE EXT. DELUX TRIM ALSO
&gt;THE JAIL BARS AND WORST OF ALL THE SIDE POPOUT WINDOWS LATCHES

He notes that the location was &quot;somewhere around flagler and 72 st&quot;. I know
it's a real long shot but if you know or hear anything about this theft
please contact Bugzbugn_at_aol_dot_com, NOT ME.
