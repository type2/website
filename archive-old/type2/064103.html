Subject: Olympian Propane Heaters Info

I have a brochure on these heaters, and have seen them at the local big RV
service and parts place. Here's the address and info on the company:

U.S. Catalytic Corporation
870 Napa Valley Corporate Way, Suite K
Napa, CA   94558
707-255-4181

FAX 707-255-2607

I don't own one of these, just know what I've read about them and been told
by the guys at the RV place. The model 3100 (1600-2800 BTU) only uses an
1/8th lb of propane per hour. Size 11 3/4&quot; X 10 1/4&quot; X 3 1/2&quot;. Only 6 lbs.

Here's what is says about them in the brochure.

&quot;Olympian A Model Catalytic Safety Heaters produce heat by combining L/P
gas and oxygen in a platinum impregnated pad. This establishes a chemical
reaction (combustion) resulting in the release of heat...operating at all
times below the temperature necessary to support flame combustion. It is
this combustion without flame that produces a low intensity infrared
catalytic heat that warms like the sun.&quot;

&quot;Catalytic heating is a no-waste form of heating since no heat is lost
through a flue or chimney. Flame type heaters waste up to 45% of all heat
produced. Catalytic heating is nearly 100% effecient, resulting in a more
effecient and low cost heat&quot;

That sounds good to me. I like the cost and they warranty for 3 years.
Also if you want an excellent RV parts catalog full of nifty little things
that can be used in the VW's call San Francisco RV Service for a
catalog.(415)282-0101. It costs 4.95 but is well worth it. No I don't work
there...blah, blah, blah...they've just treated me good.

Usual Disclaimers...
Thanks! Tom
