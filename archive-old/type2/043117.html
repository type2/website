Subject: Re: Low Oil Pressure on Rebuild

Bob,

It sounds like you are using Castro Syntec, is that
right?  I used it on my worn out first 2L and it
didn't seem to hurt or help.  Since I was also having
low oil pressure with that engine, I liked the Castrol
ad that showed an engine running with no oil.  I
figured that might be the same as no oil pressure
(little VW type 4 joke).  Is there anything magical
about 3.3K for the synthetic switch?  I was wondering
if you should wait until compression hits as high a
pressure as it's going to, by recording compression
every 1K miles or so.

Who rebuilt your 2Ls low end, and how much did he
charge you?  How do I get intouch with him?  Your oil
pressure numbers are so impressive it might be worth
the trip.  I've got another block I might consider
getting rebuilt for later.  It doesn't sound like your
mechanic even bothers to check oil pressure after a
rebuild, which makes the high pressures even more
amazing.

&gt; oh I use (after the first 3,300 mile breakin) 5-50
&gt; weight synthetic but I
&gt; don't think this has much effect.  I did a test
&gt; right when I changed from
&gt; dino to synth to see if there was a difference and
&gt; in a long day on the
&gt; road there was no measurable difference in either
&gt; the oil temp or presure.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm up to over 15,000 now on this rebuild and the
&gt; oil presure remains the
&gt; same.  (this BTW is a daily driver in the mid
&gt; atlantic area)
