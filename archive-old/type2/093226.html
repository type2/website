Subject: Re: [T2] Master cylinder


&gt;A friend of mine not on the list is doing brakes on his 76.  He needs a
&gt;master.  Is there any reason not to get one from NAPA, or other reputable
&gt;parts place?  I suggested he try one of the vendors, but he needs it now
&gt;rather than in a week or so.
&gt;
&gt;Also, if the master is bad, will that make it seem like the booster isn't
&gt;working properly?  What it is doing is the pedal is soft and will fade, but
&gt;will pump up.  It also seems like regular brakes, not power brakes.

I bought a Beetle MC in 1995 from Advance Auto only to have it fail a year 
later when I took the car off the road. Was in storage for a few months and 
failed.

I would buy one from NAPA or other store where the pros shop. I would not 
buy one from Advance (worked there for 6 months of evenings) Auto.

That said - buying from the vendors ensures their survival and we need them 
for window rubber and other weird VW stuff.

I understand though that you need it now and for those times I shop local too.
