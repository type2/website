Donuts.... Is there *anything* they can't do?

So Jeff Carver says:
&gt; Glad to someone else eats a 'Power Breakfast'.
&gt; Donuts &amp; milk, now, that's my idea of a REAL breakfast.
&gt; 
&gt; An so Bob reports in his Inuvik Trip Log:
&gt; &gt; After waiting for about an hour I wandered over to the grocery
&gt; &gt; store for a belated breakfast of donuts and milk.
