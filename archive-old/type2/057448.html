&gt;I mention this only because I think my bus either has the flaps removed or

&gt;my oil temp gauge reads 240 after 10 minutes of highway driving...  I'm
&gt;running 10w30 (soon changing to 30w), air/fuel mixture is per bentley
&gt;specs (3 turns out from bottom) on the 34pict3, and all my tin is in

Tom,

The A/F mixture that you care about is not set by turning that little
screw.  The screw sets the idle mixture.  The &quot;main&quot; mixture is determined
by the size of the venturi, main jet, and air correction jet.  Check your
main jet and make sure it is the correct size -  I don't know what that is
for your bus, I only know the dual Solexes in my '73.
