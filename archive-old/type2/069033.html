&gt;Pat's right, and one more pet peeve I have is &quot;don't leave any sharp edges.&quot; 
&gt;If you cut off the ends with the blades of the cutters perpendicular to the tie
&gt;wrap rather than parallel to it (turn the pliers 90 degrees from the way you
&gt;normally use them) there will be less chance of a scratch or cut later on.

Howdy, VW friends and familiy,

I have found that a cheap pair of &quot;flush-cut&quot; snippers for electronic work,
available at your local Radio Shack, make very clean cuts in nylon
wire-ties.  These snippers cost about $4.00US, and are well worth the money.
