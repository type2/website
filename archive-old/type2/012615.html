Subject: sudden idle problem - spare tire mount

Just a thought on the idle thing...
  Same thing happend to me.. suddenly wouldnt idle, had to
nurse it back home. Found a cracked vacuum hose (elbow that
connected steel lines) This was on a 74 tho. 

  My spare tire on the front mounts so that you can put a
hubcap on it. The mount came on the bus when I bought it.
That being said... I have been told that it is important
that the tire contacts the skin of the bus. This helps
support and distribute the weight of the tire so that the
metal in the front is not fatigued (as quickly) and
deformed (bent) as the tire is buffeted by the wind as you
go down the road.
   For what it's worth..............
