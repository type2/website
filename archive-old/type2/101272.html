&lt;&lt; In the event your bus is totalled, you will have to use NADA and ads to 
prove the value of your bus.  It is a fact like anything else. &gt;&gt;

When my 69 ghia was rear-ended this summer it took an adjuster's appraisal, 
about a weeks worth of phone conversations, numerous faxed receipts and pages 
of internet &quot;for sale&quot; postings of same year cars before the insurance 
company settled on the value listed in the &quot;CPI&quot; guide.  They were quite 
adamant about not accepting the NADA value.
