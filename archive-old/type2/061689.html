I've been curious about doing it to my '69 camper.  I was thinking of using the compressor parts from a late '70s super beetle's ac, and making a wooden blower unit from scratch to mount on the ceiling.  

I looked into mounting a camper ac on my roof in the rear cargo area, but aparently those units are all 120volt.

I would be very interested in hearing how your friend installed ac into his '70 westy.
