Subject: Re: [T2]gauge Locations


&gt;Bus Boys sells a three gauge faceplate that allows you to mount three gauges
&gt;in the dashboard space under the radio. It involves cutting the dash. When
&gt;installed correctly it looks factory. I've seen photos of it on various
&gt;peoples websites. I'll keep an eye out for a photo.

I did install my gauges in the dash under the radio several years ago and 
it is perfect. You simply need a 2&quot; hole cutter - it's the type you use to 
install door knobs and the like.

If you have to buy one buy a good major brand name like DeWalt - the el 
cheapo generic ones won't survive the project and you really want to get 
the cut down without drift and thus chewing up your dash.

Be REALLY sure you want to do this as it is obviously non-repairable! 
However that said it looks factory. There is room for 3 two inch gauges. 
Measure twice (or three times) cut once...

Don't know where to tell you to mount the fourth gauge.
