after freezing my butt off in the bus last winter, i decided that it's just not meant to be. my attempts to make the heater pump out more than a trickle of warm air failed, and sad to say, it just doesn't seem worth it this year, since i have another car ['81 VW Rabbit], with a real heater that actually works. [talk about over compensation for the lousy heaters in the aircooleds - the rabbit heater could probably warm up the whole bus in 5 minutes, it pumps out so much hot air!]

So, i want to cover the bus this winter. I live in Boston, not far from the water. that means that i get torrential rain when it rains, and massive snowfall when it snows. and it's brutally cold with the sea breeze. Since the bus won't be driven for the whole winter, i want to protect it from these elements. it'll be parked in a private parking lot, but not covered by a roof. The cover i buy needs to be able to resist sunlight, cold, rain, and snow. it would be nice if i could lock it in place, too - just to prevent theft.

any suggestions? favorites? things i should avoid?

thanks,
-perry
