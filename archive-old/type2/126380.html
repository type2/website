Subject: Dipstick sending unit for oil temp gauge

I just got word from the Bus Depot that they no longer can get the dipstick sending unit for VDO oil temp gauges, which has been touted so much by those in this group.  By remote chance, does anyone have a secret source of these?  (And no, let's not talk about meat thermometers again, OK?)

Thanks.
