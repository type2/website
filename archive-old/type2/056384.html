Subject: cylinder shims

I have used shims under the cylinders to lower the compression ratio.  I've
never had a problem with this method.  They couldn't &quot;burn out&quot; because
there is little heat or pressure in this area.  If you use shims between the
head and cylinder they could burn out because this area is subjected to
combustion heat and pressure.  However, I have used shims here also and
never had a problem.  If you shim under the cylinder be sure to apply a thin
coating of silicone sealer to the surfaces to prevent oil leaks.  Use good
quality silicone, the orange stuff, not the blue.
