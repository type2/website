[g] that card is available, but i just went about it another way. you were
in my thoughts. but the dewd is a hater, i could see him reloading and he
needed equilibrium. i put a wide piece of vw tape on the situation. and we
left it as &quot;haven't seen one of these in years&quot;. its not the first time this
happened either. few years ago i went to a welder to have a gusset put on my
68 DC passenger door. they crack around the mirror and i had to have
something done on the inside to sure it up. welder says that's the ugliest
car i've ever seen. i got defensive. i said i just found this in the trash,
as trash, loaded with wet sopping trash inside and out a few months ago,
give it time. didn't matter, hippie truck. its a eugene theme coming from
the invaded species directed toward the invading species.
