Subject: a word of thanks

Just a quick note of thanks. Just before the server went down, I'd asked for
the name of a starter mount. By the time I came back with coffee there was
my answer.
And other options continued to come in.
So inspite of the occasional bickering, like any good dysfunctional family,
you guys always come through.:-)
