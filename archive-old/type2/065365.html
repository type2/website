Subject: Here's an oddball question

 Upon removing the distributor from my '81 Vanagon I discovered that
 the screw which holds the electrical connection for the Hall
 generator to the body of the distributor has disappeared.  I've tried
 a variety of metric screws in the threaded hole but haven't hit on
 the right one.  I _think_ it's 5mm, but I don't know the pitch.
 Anybody know what screw this takes?
