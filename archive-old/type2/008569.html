Back in the early 70's, when my only vehicle was a 1962.5 Kombi (there was
something evil about the 1962.5 1200cc engine, that meant it could not
easily be rebuilt) I bought a spiral bound book called something like 'the
volkswagen guide for the compleat idiot'.  Its cover was a black and white
drawing of a 1970's type sitting on the roof of a beetle, no doubt humming
his mantra.  It was actually a good, practical mechanical manual and saved
me lots of money.  Now that I have a 1982 air cooled transporter with
250,000 kilometres on the clock, I wish I could find the modern equivalent
of that book.  Does anyone recognise it, and know whether it has ever been
updated?
