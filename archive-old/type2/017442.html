&gt; &gt;This particular shop's style is the &quot;top-of-the-line&quot; overhaul, with new
&gt; &gt;case.  He says it'll run about $3400.  Way out of my budget.  And there
&gt; &gt;are places around town, he guessed, that would start with the original
&gt; &gt;case, etc., and do the job for perhaps $2000, although with a
&gt; &gt;corresponding reduction in total quality and lifespan of the job.  A
&gt; &gt;devil's choice.
&gt; 
&gt; Bill,
&gt; 
&gt; I'd say that the shop's style is also a high profit margin:
&gt; 
&gt; A rebuilt engine for your bus from AVP (http://www.sacbiz_dot_com/avp/) is $820
&gt; outright, plus about $100 for shipping. Installation for the upright engine
&gt; is a snap (compared to almost any other engine in any other car). If I
&gt; recall, I've seen posts from folks who were quoted about $500 for
&gt; installation.
&gt; 
&gt; IMHO a good rebuild is as good as a new engine.
&gt; 
&gt; If I were you, I'd get my bus out of *that* shop before they suck you dry.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Ed
Ed and Bill:
I'd second that motion and at least get a second opinion, or if you have
time, spend less money, get a GOOD compression guage, and check the
compression and set the  valves yourself. Also, just put in a new set of
Bosch points and set the point gap and check the timing. I also agree
with Ken's remark that you could drive for years with lotsa end play.
The big problem here is timing changes when you push in the clutch. The
reaction to the throwout bearing moving back pushes the whole crank back
and that advances the timing a BUNCH! The good news is that this usually
occurs when the engine is not heavily loaded, and most of the time the
timing is NOT artificially advanced.
I'd guess the shop saw the end play and saw an opportunity to make a
boat payment (thanks, Tom and Ray)!
My brother once worked in a shop where the owner had the idea that high
repair bills gave the customers a certain amount of cachet or bragging
rights among their friends. He's still in business 11 years later!
Still, I've owned 5 or 6 cars that if you added up all their CUMULATIVE
expenses, probably wouldn't add up to one of his repair bills for a
Porsche or Audi 5000! It's quite possible to get MUCH less than you pay
for! Most of these places are REALLY slick, particularly at telling you
why it's in your best interest to use new cases, heads,and so on. I
personally would rather have a line bored German case than some later
cases and most cases should be able to be line bored at least 2 times. I
know, sometimes they crack, but a GOOD shop should be able to have it
welded before line boring, if that's a problem.
