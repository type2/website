I am interested in the Oxygen sensor thing. Is there a pin out that the ECU
will connect to in order to add that info into the mix as part of the FI
installation? I understand from reading, that the CA versions have that. Are
the ECU's different or is this just un-monitored in the FED version. Do you
need to have the Cat installed? I run an S&amp;S extractor so I don't have one
in the mix. Even if the sensor isn't monitored by the ECU, do you have the
correct voltage readings for setting for the mixture? (or link)

BTW - I sent the wiper procedure thing in on 5/25 (long) for the AFC plate
move recently. It worked well for me.

Another problem I had in the past was the Auxilary Air Regulator which
raises the idle speed for warm up by allowing more air in. After the temp
reaches 120 degrees it shuts the flow of excess air off. This is metered air
(by the AFC) but it bypasses the throttle control. One of the traces in the
double relay had burned away and the voltage the AAR should receive to shut
down after warm up was no longer present. This caused some serious erratic
idle at times but as the engine warmed up the bimetal spring in the AAR
would eventually close due to ambient engine temp and the problem seemed to
go away temporarily. To test for this block off both the inlet port on the
's' shaped bellows and hose to the AAR. Make SURE the elbow that connects to
the AAR is in good shape as well. Complete description of this part can be
found in Bentley's page 12 section 10.
