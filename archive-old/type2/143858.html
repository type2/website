Subject: Re: [T2] Adding gaUges -spelling

You have got to be kidding.  :-O
     
Gage is wrong.  Gauge is right.  And Max of
Albertson_dot_edu is correct on the spelling E-mail.
  
CORRECT Gauge:
 
(1)  A standard or scale of measurement. 
(2)  A standard dimension, quantity, or capacity. 
(3)  An instrument for measuring or testing. 
(4)  A means of estimating or evaluating; a test: a
gauge of character.
    
WRONG Gage:
    
(1)  Something deposited or given as security against
an obligation; a pledge. 
(2)  Something, such as a glove, that is offered or
thrown down as a pledge or challenge to fight. 
(3)  A challenge
    
When in doubt, look it up.  :D
