Subject: '74 Campmobile (engine swap?)

Hey Volks,
        Well, I talked the PO of that '74 Campmobile, and from what he tells
me, the rear main seal needs replacing, and since the clutch is slipping due
to the oil splashing from the bad seal, it will need replacing too(?)  Am I
right in assuming that no amount of cleaning will remove this oil and return
the clutch to usable condition?
