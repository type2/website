I want to reply to 3 subjects here.

Re: Best way to Restore Wheels
If you powdercoat your wheels you have to take some precautions when
mounting them due to the hardness of the coating. If you do nothing the
lug nuts will tend to loosen up over the first 1000 miles which can result
in a lost wheel on the freeway. To counter that one should either
retighten the lugs a couple times over the first 500 miles or remove the
powder coating from the surfaces where the lug nuts meet the wheels.

Re: VW is to Mercedes, as hard is to find..
What year did Mercedes switch to 14&quot; wheels? My '64 has 13&quot; wheels.

Re: Wind Shield - Window Removal
Removing it is easy. Just cut the rubber out from the inside. As for
attacking the rust, if you don't have a bunch of holes I recommend sanding
down with 36 grit paper and then coating the area with fiberglass resin.
This will seal the area so water can no longer get at the metal.
