&gt;My insurance agent with State Farm would not let me &quot;add on&quot; my '78
&gt;Westfalia to my Jeep's existing policy.
&gt;
&gt;He said becuase the Westfalia is officially considered a motor home by the
&gt;insurance industry, I had to buy a separate/second policy, and could not
&gt;list it as a &quot;second vehicle&quot; on my Jeep's policy.
&gt;
&gt;I have not stopped by the DMV yet to register my recent purchase, but your
&gt;encounter with &quot;Ms. DMV&quot; doesn't seem out of line to me.

When I went to register our '71 Westy, the DMV clerk couldn't tell one VW
from another on the computer screen.  She actually turn the screen towards
me and I helped her locate the correct vehicle during which, I gave her a
brief overview of VW lineage.  : )
