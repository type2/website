Subject: Noise from shifter
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

I have had my 75 bus for about a year now.  Since I got it, I have had to hold
the shifter to one side to avoid it from making noise (Sounds like vibration).
It is a little hard to put in first gear but doesn't pop out of any gears.

Is there something I can do to stop the noise and or make it more easy to
shift?  Thanks in advance for the help
