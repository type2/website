Subject: Re: [T2] A TIREsome thread

&gt; &gt; Firestone Wilderness AT III 27 x 8.5 SR14C max load 1515	$74
&gt; &gt; BF Goodrich All Terrain T/A K/O 27x8.5 max load 1515		$89
&gt;
&gt; Only the first two of these have a high enough load rating for a bus,
&gt; particularly a loaded Westy,

Id like to point out that the minimum rim width for 27 x 8.5 is wider than
what we have. I actually read the whole spec at goodyear one day.
I know some people run them without trouble and advocate them but that
makes me wary.
