Gary,
Ron's AKA the busdepot ,info is correct, to be a little more specific the
chassis numbers for the corresponding change over is, brake servo ATE
'71-'74 (214 2110 465) and brake servo Bendix '74 (214 211 466)-'79. I
cannot say for sure weather they will switch out or not. My head says no.
Also I wonder if Ron's AKA the busdepot ,rebuilt/ new is transposed, the
rebuilts are usually the old ones and the new are the newer although his
part numbers look good, hmmm. Probably OK.
Just my two cents and a little added value from you to me,
Can you post this to the list? my regular email is not sending out... ISP's
arggghhh!

 &gt; What are diameters?  Are the internal diaphragms
 &gt; generally replaced in the rebuilt units?  Who makes the new ones?
