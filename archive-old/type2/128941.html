Subject: Fwd: [T2] Karl Von Salzen

Karl story:

There was a guy doing business as &quot;Old Volks Home&quot; in California, 
apparently near Karl's home. (Maybe he's still on the list.) I was 
trying to change Peregrine's fuel system from illegal carbutors to fuel 
injection. The guy helped me with new fuel line and half a dozen other 
parts. But he couldn't get me a brain. Instead, he got in touch with 
Karl, who sent me a brain for $40. It all happened so efficiently that 
I didn't have the presence of mind to point out that, while I could put 
the purchase of stuff from Old Volks on my American Express, that might 
not cover Karl. I had $0.00 in cash. So I asked Karl what I could buy 
him that I could put on my card. He said he didn't need anything. 
Squat. It took an extra week or two for me to get a check to Karl.

I'm glad he didn't squeal on me to the list!
