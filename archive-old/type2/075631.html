Subject: Re: [T2] Wanted: Bus Towbar

If you're going to be towing as a matter of course, get a tow dolly or,
even better, a trailer.  You can reverse with a trailer, but not with a
towbar or dolly.

&gt; The wifee-poo and I recently bought one of them big Class-C MHs. It's got a
&gt; 5,000 pound towing capacity. I've got a 3,400 pound Westy.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone have a towbar?
