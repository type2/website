Greetings,

    I went to get my 77 Bus safety test done and my windshield wipers =
failed. They were not spraying. As soon as I filled the tank with air =
pressure..... I was soaked! Seemed the hoses were not connected. I =
reconnected them and tried again. Seems that as soon as I fill the tank =
with air the driver's side sprayer goes off without me pushing on the =
wiper handle. Any ideas on how to fix this? Is it wired wrong? Do I need =
a new windshield washer motor? And where the heck is the washer motor?

Soaked in Utah,
