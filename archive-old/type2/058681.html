I am now the proud owner of a 1968 VW camper in fairly good shape. One or
the problems I am experiencing is a bit of play in the steering. It is more
noticeable at higher speed (between 40 and 60). Is this just the way a bus
drives, and something I should get use to, or is this something I should
work on. any input would be greatly appreciated?
