&gt; &gt; - '77 case w/FI
&gt; &gt; - earlier heads (1800) ...dude knew I was building a 2.0 liter FI
&gt; &gt; engine, but...the heads he's already sold me (are) (1800/2000
&gt; heads).
&gt;
&gt; This is not a big deal. I am also running 1800 heads on my 2.0
&gt; Liter engine.



Actually, 1.8L heads use slightly bigger valves than 2L heads, so if
anything they would be an improvement.
