Subject: Starter Woes - final report

Starter would not engage when I turned the ignition switch to activate 
position.

Started to cut into wires for a temporary &quot;push-button&quot; fix, and just could 
not bring myself to do it.
The thought of changing out the ignition switch caused me even more heartburn.

So, I went back to the engine compartment, and skinned a bit of insulation 
off of the wire that drives the hot start relay. Connected a jumper to 
apply direct battery source 12 VDC to the skinned area and could hear the 
relay clicking whenever I put the 12 VDC to it.

The relays was engaging, and the contacts were &quot;clunking&quot;, but no starter 
activation.

Suspected dirty contacts down at the starter - checked, and no - they were 
clean.

So I went back to the relay, and started clicking it in rapid fashion - 
maybe the relay contacts were corroded - bus had not been run much in the 
past 2 years.
The clicking in rapid fashion would do 2 things - sparks might tend to 
clean the contacts, and back EMF (collapsing currents causing high voltage 
spikes) off of the starter windings might cause additional sparking on the 
contacts for even more cleaning.

Pretty soon (after many, many voltage taps being applied to do the click 
thingy),
the starter engaged when I hit the relay coil wire with the 12 VDC.

I have started the engine via the ignition switch about 12 times now, and 
all works fine.

Dirty relay contact - WOW !!
