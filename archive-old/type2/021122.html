&gt; Hi list
&gt;      Wondering if anyone has come across this before.
&gt;      Recently I purchased a parts bus (rusted out underside) that had been a
&gt; transporter passenger bus, converted to a homemade weekender. The original
&gt; rear seats had been out of the bus for apparently many years, as they are in
&gt; very, very good condition and appear to have never been recovered.
&gt;      Howevere, this bus had been sitting still for the last 2 years. PO had
&gt; put the rear seats inside the bus for storage during this time.  The window
&gt; seals leaked water down onto the shag carpeting, creating a wonderful musty,
&gt; wet carpet smell in an otherwise enclosed bus.
&gt;      So, now these VG condition seats stink like musty carpet. Of course
&gt; tried scrubbing them, etc.  Smell is still there.
&gt;      It would seem a crime to take apart seats that have factory covers on
&gt; them, that have no rips or tears anywhere.

Brian:
Bleach kills mold and mildew.  You can mix it with quite a bit of water maybe a
cup to a gallon of water. You may be able to take the seats out and put them
upside down so that gravity will draw the bleach into the cushions. be careful
you don't put so much on that it comes through and discolors the vinyl.
Just sitting outside in the sunshine and wind will kill the mildew too, but keep
the rain off them. I'd not leave them in the sun for more that a couple of weeks
cause the UV is pretty hard on the sructure of the vinyl.
