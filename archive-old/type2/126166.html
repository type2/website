Subject: Re: [T2] Hela coil bonded to spark plug

Hello Rae   Thats probably not a heli coil but a KD bushing  You can buy 
replacement bushing at most FLAPS  be sure to get the correct lenght they come in 
1/2 in and 3/4 in. which is whaats needed for a type 4 motor,   1/2 in is for 
most type 1 motors.  The Kd bushings are famous about coming out with the plug 
and are almost impossible to get off  the plug.A heli coil will look like a 
coiled spring  the KD bushing looks more like a sleeve   later  and have fun
