Subject: Re: [T2] 1979 Rear Wheel Bearings?  HELP!

&gt; Richard, *NO ONE* greases rear bearings at the recommended intervals.
&gt; OK, maybe Rick does, but he has a custom tool.  Rick.. POST PICTURES!!!!

Yes, please do.

It's sucks they are loose after so little mileage. Can excessive wheel
camber accelerate the problem?
 
&gt; First, again I say that getting the stub axle out of the bearings is the
&gt; hardest part.  With the big Snap-On CJ pullers, it goes fine, but back at

You win, I will finally break down and get the CJs.

&gt; The third incredible &lt;euphemism&gt;bear&lt;/euphemism&gt; is the circlip.  I have
&gt; found no common tool that will remove it peacably.  First, you get *ONE*
&gt; shot at pulling it with a pair of needle-nose pliers, after which you have
&gt; rounded it and it *won't* come out.

Just use that little black arrow that Bentley shows. ;-)

Thanks for all the tips, I will prepare...
