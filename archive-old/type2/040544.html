Tim, too bad you're way out in Maryland.  I have a '77 Westy for sale,
$2500.  Only problem is the bus and I are both in Bellingham Washington.
If anybody is interested you should drop me a note.

&gt; Hello,
&gt;    Does anyone out there know about or own a VW bus
&gt; that they would sell in the Maryland area?  I have
&gt; been looking for one for a long time and have no luck.
&gt;  I would like it to be in OK condition-running a
&gt; little rust.  Thanks a lot for your help.  I had a few
&gt; respond on my other ? and this list is great.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again.
&gt; 
&gt; Peace,
