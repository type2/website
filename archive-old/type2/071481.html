&gt; How did that get to be the general concensus?
I've run calibration checks on at least four oil temp gauges, and six CHT 
gauges in the last few years.  Three of the four oil temp gauges were off by 
at least 30 degrees.  Four of the CHT gauges were off by at least 30 degrees 
one was off by 60 degrees.  I use a Fluke thermocouple thermometer as my 
temperature reference. I use an HP power supply as the voltage source when I 
do the oil temp gauges.
The reason VDO is still in business is that nobody checks the accuracy of 
their gauges.
