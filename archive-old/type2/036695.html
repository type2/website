hey list
i just put an AVP head on lizzy (1800 cc) and although
it seems to idle well and run pretty good, im
experienceing some sputtering at about 55-60 mph in
4th gear and some rough running if you really get on
it going through the other gears. and once in a while
if you let off the gas at higher speed to say coast
down a hill, it will let out one backfire.   i put the
head in and went and adjusted the valves, what could
this problem be, could it be timing?   any suggestions
would be appreciated.thanks
