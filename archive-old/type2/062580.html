Subject: D-Jet vs L-Jet -Reply

Here's some info from the book &quot;How To Understand, Service, and
Modify Bosch Fuel Injection and Engine Management&quot;

D-Jetronic was the first of the Bosch pulsed injection systems.  I write
about it at the end because the most recent cars with Bosch D-Jetronic
were the 1975 Volvo 164E and the 1975 Mercedes 450.  In 1976, both
changed to K-Jetronic (a continuous injection system, also used on the
VW Rabbit).  It's most interesting to see how L-Jetronic evolved from
D-Jetronic.  At the 1967 introduction, Bosch called it ECGI, Electronically
Controlled Gasoline Injection, contrasting this new electronic system with
a long background of mechanically-driven injection pumps.  

Based on a cross-licensing of the Bendix Electrojector system, which
was briefly used in the U.S., D-Jetronic depends on sensing manifold
pressure as an indication of engine load.

You can refer to the L-Jetronic section for details concerning most of
D-Jetronic.  The major differences are:

manifold-pressure sensor senses engine load.
trigger contacts in the distributor synchronize injection pulses.
injectors are operated in two groups, 4-cyl, 2 groups of two.

Bosch now regards manifold-pressure sensing as a less accurate
measure of load than measuring air flow, as in L-Jetronic, and in
K-Jetronic, or measuring air mass, as in LH-Jetronic.  For certain Bosch
racing applications, however, manifold-pressure sensing is sometimes
used.  Manifold-pressure sensing is widely used by GM, Ford, Chrysler,
AMC, and some Toyotas, but the trend in passenger cars is away from
manifold-pressure sensing.

from the L-Jetronic section:

Bosch L-Jetronic systems are installed in many makes of cars sold in the
U.S., beginning in 1974.  Considering licensed versions, L-Jetronic has
the largest world-wide installed base of any port-type injection system. 
The Bosch pulsed systems are developments of L-Jetronic, except
D-Jetronic.  That leads to an interesting name confusion.  To contrast
with the original D-Jetronic, a pressure-controlled system, L-Jetronic
was described as AFC for Air Flow Control.  As it turns out, all Jetronic
systems that followed D-Jetronic are air-flow or air-mass controlled,
including the continuous systems.

My own words:  L-Jetronic must be a pretty good system if it has the
largest installed base of any port-type injection system.  I like mine.  I
stronly recommend anyone with a fuel-injected VW to purchase the book
that this info came from, it's really thorough.
