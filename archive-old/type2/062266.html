Dear Bob and other Volks,

Yesterday I called the Universal Corporation, makers of the Capacitative 
Discharge Ignition (CDI) unit recommended by Bob Hoover for use with VW engines.
(See Sermons of Bob Hoover website for discussions of CDI) A pleasant woman 
named Nancy answered my questions and FAXed me some current product information.


She said they are back in production, but the JC Whitney catalog decided not to 
carry their product any more. You can still order a Tiger 581 CDI direct from 
Universal, but prices are up from last year. Cost is now $84.95 for the regular 
unit, or $94.95 for one Nancy called the &quot;Baja&quot; unit that has a treated circuit 
board for improved water resistance. Prices include shipping, and only CO 
residents must pay the 3% sales tax. These things are smog legal, even in 
California!

Nancy said I would have to make a simple adaptor to process the trigger voltage 
for the lead running from the coil to my '78 Westfalia's electronic fuel 
injection. A capacitor and a resistor and a bit of soldering- sounds manageable 
for a veteran of many Heathkit projects. Instructions come with the unit. Owners
of carburated vehicles need not bother.

Their CDI will work with distributors containing points, or with breakerless 
optical or magnetic ignitions. Universal sells a conversion kit to replace your 
distributor's points with magnetic triggering for $54.95, about the same price 
as Pertronix and Compu-Fire's kits. 

Since I just invested $7.50 in two new Bosch point sets, I think I'll save my 
pennies on that second item for a while. Bob says with proper adjustment and the
CDI, I'll get 50,000 miles out of a set of points (and a set of spark plugs) so 
I may be set for quite a while. I think I'll pop for a Tiger 581 CDI though. Bob
says they're the cat's meow, and they claim performance and mileage increases no
less than the $300 Jacobs Bug Pak. &quot;Right now&quot; is always a good time to start 
getting better gas mileage, and I'm on the eve of some long trips.

Respectfully,
Surfer Bob
