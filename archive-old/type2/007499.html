Subject: Your Opinion Please: Vanagon or Late Model Bus Westy?
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Volks-

I bought a 1984 Westy this year, and I think that it is a wonderful
vehicle.  I LOVE the (reasonably) powerful engine, the A/C, and the real
heating system, but I can't help but yearn just a bit for a simpler (and
cheaper!) air-cooled bus.  I'm never in a hurry (especially when
traveling), so I don't really care about the underpowered nature of a
late model bus, but the lack of A/C and decent heating might get to me
after awhile.  

Anyway, I'm finding myself actually considering selling my (just now
getting into nice condition) 84 Westy and buying a restored (or
restorable) 1970s era camper bus...

I should mention that a Bus would NOT be a &quot;daily driver&quot; for me (I ride
a bike for 95% of my transportation needs).  Also, the climate here is
very mild - only 2-3 months of cool and/or rainy weather each year - so
lousy heat or defrost isn't a concern.

What do you think?  Would you trade the comfort and relative speediness
of a Vanagon for the simplicity of a late model bus?  Any Vanagon owner
who would NEVER go back after owning a Vanagon?  How about anyone with a
Bus who wouldn't own a Vanagon?

I'm really interested in hearing your thoughts on this.

Thanks,
Marty Wallace, 1984 Westfalia &quot;Heisenberg&quot;
(but, just maybe...a really fine example of a 1978 Westy someday...)
Chico, California
