the real advantages of guages are to monitor trends, if you normally run
at 200F and suddenly you are running at 250F then you know there is a
problem...  on mine (78) I consider the outside temp and usually add
100-150degrees, I slow down to 55 or so at 235-240F and pull over and let
it idle in the shade at 250F

oil presure probably shouldn't get below 10psi at idle and 25-30 at speed


these are very subjective

&gt; mornin dubers,
&gt; 
&gt;     ok here's the deal, I just got an AWESOME new job but its 50 miles away
&gt; (40 highway, 10 city)
&gt; My '78 bus, is loven the high way miles, not to mention all the attention
&gt; she gets... ;)
&gt; I've picked up some gauges to help me &quot;keep my fingers on her pulse&quot; but now
&gt; that I have them I realize that I have no bases for what the numbers
&gt; mean.....
&gt; the gauges I have are:
&gt; 
&gt; autometer oil temp / using a VDO dipstick sender
&gt; VDO volt meter
&gt; Stewart Warner amps gauge
&gt; VDO oil pressure (not in yet, waiting on sender)
&gt; Sun Super Tach II Mini - Model #CP7908 8k RPM (not  in yet)
&gt; biding on an autometer cylinder head temp gauge
&gt; 
&gt; so the question is:
&gt; what are Ideal readings
&gt; and what are the oh S*%$ readings????
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance
&gt; 
&gt; Mike LaBarge
