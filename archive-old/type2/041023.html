Subject: Go West Young Men

Hey Everybody,
    My brother and I are heading out West this weekend for about 10 days.
I'm bringing the AIRS list and wanted to give fair warning to those people
West of the Mississippi.  This is my first solo road trip.  I'm taking or
doing everything I can think of, but the one thing I forget is the one thing
I'll need.  We all know how that is.
    Can anyone recomend any good VW salvage yards to visit?  Or some nice
cheap places to spend the night, we're on a tight budget.  Wish us luck...

See you down the road,
