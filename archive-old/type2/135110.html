Subject: '73 rivy for sale in Lawrence, KS

Hi all,
     Up for sale, is the '73 rivy I've had lurking around my place for the
past 2 years and never did much with.  Got it back from the shop today and
it is now running and under it's own power.  Lot of unknowns, but is
driveable.  I'd expect to trailer/tow it away so as not to be surprised.
Used 1800 engine in it with Dellorto 36 drla carbs.  Definitely needs TLC
and I have toooooo many projects and not enough time.  Overall body is in
good shape, with a few dings.  No major rust, only surface stuff, but not
much.  Interior cloth is really nice.  Gonna need brakes for sure as it's
set for the better part of 5 years.  Here are some pics:

Has valid Maine registration through January 31.  I can renew it for the
cost of renewal added to the bill.  Blue light special price of $1700.

Bryant
