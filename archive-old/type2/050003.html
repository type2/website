Yes,
it is true. The old Lorax is biting the big one. I relocated to KY from DE
to find out
 from a mechanic I met on the list (Gentry) the engine is totalled.
2600 to repair. I have already put 6000 into this bus and have absolutely
nothing physical
 to show for it. I have gained many new friends, learned alot about VW's and
what not to buy.
 I think some of you may take offense to this, but I like heat and I think I
am going to buy
a new Euro van westie. next year though, the credit needs to build alittle,
so I am off to
the VW dealership to buy a used car to build the credit so I can buy the
Euro van next year.
 Sad story I have with the lorax, I love that thing more than any of my
family understand,
 but I know all of you understand, Thanks for being there for me. Anyway, I
have alot of stuff,
 as the body is not in a shape to sell and the engine is in a thousand
pieces on Gentry's floor.

 So if you need engine tin,
heaterboxes (barely used)
exhaust(brand new),
any kind of non engine part,
interior fixture parts,
side mirrors,
grill,
lights,steering wheel, wheels,
electrical stuff,
meters, side tent, glass,
engine lid, side door,
handles with keys,
drop a mail, or call me at home:859-389-9403 or cell 859-351-7075
anytime m-f after 6pm eastern time.
I can ship anything.
Thanks
Monica Reynolds

PS please buy some stuff from me so I can at
least feel as though I get something in return for the 6000 I spent.
And don't get me wrong I enjoyed every bit of it.



&quot;it's not the destination,
but the way in which you get there&quot;
I'll be bussin soon.


..A little bit harder,
 a little bit more,
a little bit further than we've gone before..
