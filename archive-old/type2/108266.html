Subject: Mystery Gas Cap

All this talk about gas caps got me thinking about one that I have.
My father acquired it years and years ago.  It looks exactly like
the VW stock gas cap for a late 70's bus except that it has a small
piece of black plastic on a spring in the middle of it that flips
open to reveal a tiny key hole.  It's a locking gas cap.  I have it,
and use it often, and love it because it looks stock.  It also gives
the pump jockeys in Oregon fits when they try to figure out why they
can't get the cap off.  I have seen only one of these other than the
one that I've got.  Anybody know which cap I'm talking about?  Was
this an aftermarket thing? or did pops pick it up at the VW dealer
back in the day?
