Subject: Rockford-Fosgate In-Car 20GB MP3 audio system $99  (Today Only)

Thought this link might interest some. This Rockford Fosgate MP3 car audio
system comes with a dash-mounted controller, a small remotely-mounted 20 gb
hard-drive based MP3 player, and an 802.llb adapter. It actually downloads
music from your PC wirelessly while the van sits in your driveway. It has a
line output jack, so if your indash does not have a line input jack you'd
need an FM transmitter (about $15 from various places).

This is similar to the PhatNoise/MusicKeg system that VW offers for newer
VW's. But the VW version only works with certain VW indashes. Since this one
comes with its own controller (shallow enough to velcro to your dash) it can
be used in a Bus with your existing indash.

This is a discontinued item and originally sold for around $600. I've read
that it's a bit flakey, but not horrible, and there are user forums, free
third-party free software, etc. that improve on its functionality. (For
example, I use the Twonky music server for my home MP3 setup, which also
works with this unit.)  I wouldn't buy this for $600, but for $99 you're not
risking much.

Since it's on woot_dot_com, who only runs 1-day deals, it's only available
through the end of the day today. I have not tried this unit myself, so I
can't comment on it personally. But I have a similar indash unit (a Rio Car
/ Empeg), and love it. Once you get used to having a few hundred songs at
your fingertips on your dashboard, you can't imagine going back to CD.
