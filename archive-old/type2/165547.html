&gt; &gt; Is there a problem putting a dual port engine from a

&gt; &gt; a 68 type 2?
&gt; If you are lucky...and it is a universal case  (type 2
&gt; or 3) must have rear mount threaded holes ( 3 ) or
&gt; flanges that can be drilled and tapped

What he said about the mustache bar mounts on the rear (RIR) of the
engine.

You also will need the '71, one-year-only doghouse front tin for a bus.
The doghouse beetle front tin is smaller than the bus tin.  in a pinch,
you could probably add to the beetle tin to make it work, but you'd be
better off to find the correct tin.
