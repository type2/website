Depends which rear seat you got......
The standard rear seat is 2 parts. The back hooks on the bottom and the top
ends have brackets that have 2 screws holding it to the seat back and 1 bolt
holding it to the wall.
Did you get the 'day bed' style? The back will flip forward. It will also
turn into a bed. If yes, you need the latch bolts that mount in the wall.
These are shouldered bolts that stick out, the seat back hooks on to them.



&gt; I have a 72 Bus and I just got the rear seat for it.  I just want to know
how
&gt; does the back part of the seat, the part that folds forward, attach to the
&gt; bus?
