Subject: camper parts

I just received the manuals for my 74, 1 owners manual &amp; 1 Westfalia manual
(thanks Barry Schiff at Schiff European Automotive Literature, Inc.).  I
found that my 74 came with some pieces that I did not get when I bought it
and wanted to see if anyone on the list had these and would be willing to
sell them.  My Westy is orange, so this stuff would need to be in the
orange upholstery

1.  Jump seat that goes between sink and fridge.
2.  Storage box/trash container that goes between the two front seats.
3.  Air compressor that plugs into the socket below the glove box
4.  Child's cot

These are items that are missing from my camper and would like to get them
just to have it complete.  If you have any of the above, please pmail me
with what price you want to get for each item.

Thanks
