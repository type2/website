wanted a transmission for my '59 that would handle 80 to 100 hp and would be
geared high enough to hit 70 or so without deafening me (panel bus- no
furniture!), what do I get?  Would a stock trans from a later split be able
to reliably take that output?

first question is whether you bus came with a split case trans or not.   if
not, it is simple to put in a later reduction box trans.  if it did, you will
need an adaptor to use a later trans.

the highest geared and sturdiest ones are the 67 trans.     a stock trans may
well not be happy with running like that though.   you might want to talk to
someone about building you a trans that will go the speed you want without
high rpms.

but me myself,  i live with the nature of the beast. 
 vw buses were designed to be an inexpensive, efficient, easy to work on
 delivery van.   not a high speed sports car.   i say, if you aren't happy
going 55-60 tops, you don't want a splittie.   you'll spend too much time and
money trying to make it something it isn't.

my two cents  (and i drive a bus with a 36hp - you can tell i dont mind being
passed)
