While cleaning out a box of extremely valuable junk I found a metal plaque,
5 1/4&quot; x 1&quot;, with lugs on the back containing the lettering&quot;Sportsmobile
Penthouse, Andrews, Ind 46702  Patents Pending&quot;. It is in excellent shape.
If anyone needs this to complete a restoration, let me know and I'll send it
to you. TBear

Don't take life too seriously - you'll never live through it.
