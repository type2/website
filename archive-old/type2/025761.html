&gt; List,
&gt; While installing new pistons and cylinders last night on my 2L Type IV, I
&gt; accidentely broke one of the new rings while trying to install a piston into
&gt; the cylinder.  My question is this:  Do I have to buy an entire set of rings
&gt; now?  I have the rings from the old pistons which dont measure up exactly with
&gt; the new ones but appear in decent shape.  Is is horrible to replace brand
&gt; spankin new pistons and cylinders with a worn ring?  It sounds like that would
&gt; be stupid to me.  Also, two of the cylinders and one of the heads are already
&gt; installed.  If I have to buy a complete set of rings, should I replace the
&gt; ones on the pistons already installed?  Im buying the rings from the same
&gt; source so I would assume they would be the same or very close.  Advice on this
&gt; seemingly simple matter would be helpful!  Consequences are also always nice
&gt; to her too.  

You need to buy a complete set of rings--they don't come individually--
UNLESS you can find a mechanic that keeps a box of rings around in case he
breaks one. You don't have to change the rings that are already installed,
though.
