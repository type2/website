Thanks John,

    We use a lot of POR-15 rust stop in our body work. I have been looking
for a catalog, our local PPG dealer can't seem to remember to get us one.
You wouldn't have one or know where I can order one from?
    If you want to send it off list use  volksfix_at_bellsouth_dot_net

Thanks again,

Tommy
