Subject: 71 bus for sale in WV

Hey all, I have a 71 bus for sale. I live in 
Summersville WV. The engine is pretty much wrecked.
Body is in good shape primered but not painted. This
bus is a good project for someone, or would be good to
part out, let me know if you are interested. I will be
out of town for the holidays but I should be back on
the 2nd or 3rd of The new year. Happy Holidays to all
