&gt; Hey, what a great experience!!

yeah!?!?  BTDT
&gt;
&gt; The '78's Fuel Injection engine just suddenly STOPPED ! ! !  I was going
&gt; about 10 mph in a Woodbridge VA shopping center parking lot and I was able
&gt; to swing into one of the many empty slots.
&gt;
&gt; I checked the fuel pump at home, and it was smooth whirling.
&gt;
&gt; So I swapped out the fuel pumps and the van started right away.  I checked
&gt; the fuel pressure and I was getting just over 30 psi, possibly 32 psi.
&gt;
&gt; Just to be sure, I checked out the FI fuel pump I pulled of the '78 and it
&gt; whirled as well as the other ! ! !

don't you just love the ???? electrical problems.......   not!

glad you got her home

Bob
