Subject: 14&quot; Empi wheels?

Do they exist? If not, can anyone recommend a tastsful alternative to
stock bus wheels? All the Empis I've seen for sale on the web or in
catalogs are 15&quot;.

I've also seen &quot;Beauty Rings&quot;, but again only in15&quot;. Is the only
alternative to get the wheels chromed? I've looked into this and it is
not cheap.

I've seen adapters for fitting other mags, but I'm not going there...
