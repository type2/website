Subject: Fw: [T2] Children in a T2 camper ?

Hi Darren (and all)

I'm concidering a pre-'77 because they are tax-free to keep here in Holland.
But not too old. A bit luxurious won't hurt the family, I guess.
I would plan a few Europe trips..that's why.
Thanks for the replies concerning the seatbelts everyone. Glad that the
possibility
is there to install the belts if they are absent. Are those regulair
'Volkswagen' belts ?

Darren (or anyone), can you mail me a few pics of the inside of a T2 ? I see
a lot of pics on the web, but I'm not sure what an 'original' camper has to
look
like.

I guess that there are not 4 sleeping places for mom, dad and two kids ? Or
are there ?
Or is a fronttent (how do you guys call that..:)) neccesary for this?

And again...thanks in advance

Oscar
Holland

&gt; Hi Oscar,
&gt;
&gt; What year is the van that you are considering?
&gt; My van is a 72 camper van and it came with seatbelts in the rear seat.
&gt; Did you look under the seat in the back to see if they slipped under?
&gt; Is it the fold out bed type of rear seat?
&gt; These vehicles are great for transporting people around.
&gt; If you can't find the seat belts under the seat, then see if there was a
&gt; spot to attach them to the van.
&gt; If there is no previous spot that seat belts were attached you could make
&gt; some new attachments.
&gt; Let me know what you find out.
&gt; Darren
