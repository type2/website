Subject: carb for 2litre 1978 bus
Message-ID: &lt;7incav$4aat_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

Hi, well we have our first bus (known as Charlie Brown) which we purchased in LaPaz Mex (a long story). Anyway it seems that he is sporting a carb from a vw bug and as we attempt to make our way up the hill (we live up a mountain near Vernon BC) he protests that he can't breath (neither could I at first). Anyway we would like to optimize Chuck's abilities and wonder what carb would best satisfy his thirst (and breath). Any info appreciated, thanks!
