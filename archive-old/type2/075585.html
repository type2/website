Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Wanted: Bus Towbar

Someone in Arizona used to make them, the name escapes me at the moment.  However he passed
on a year or two ago.  This tow bar only works on 70 and down however.  It won't work with
the later buses because of the disc brakes.  But if I remember the original poster's bus
year it was below that.  I am sure there are more than a few out there if you can get
someone to come of one.

They weren't cheap though. Right at $190 or so if I remember correctly.

&gt; Robert,
&gt;
&gt; I swear I have seen one someplace....thought it was RMMW, but apparently
&gt; not as I just looked online.
&gt;
&gt; Maybe I will remember soon...let you know if I do...
&gt;
&gt; Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt; Why doesn't anyone make these? I've looked high and low and the only ones
&gt; &gt; I've seen are home made. I've thought about making some to sell at the next
&gt; &gt; VW show.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Anyone have a towbar?
