Subject: 68 brake line length anyone?

i have my dealer parts book. i looked on the depot.
noone seems to have the length listed for these.
I think the numbers are
Front Left 211 611 723 D(book) A(depot)
Front Right 211 611 724 D(book) A(depot)
MC to Rear Tee 211 611 741 E

My local vw flaps has lines but they said I need to tell them the
length. Guy told me to measure them.
