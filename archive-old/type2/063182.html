Subject: paint codes

My '69 westy was originally some tone of cream-white.  It is now Hospital White, thanx to the PO and the local Paint-N-Bake, who said the original color would be more expensive to shoot (in 1985).  Now, my question is, how do I find the paint code, name, and was the 'glass top originally this color, or was it the aforementioned Wedding White? I want to do this thing as correctly as possible(not for resale value, just so's I can sleep better at nite)
