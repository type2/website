SVDA on a Type4 bus engine?  

I'm having real problems with 009 on a type 4.  What
should I time it at to get the most driveable
combination (just until I get a better dizzy)?

&gt; I have run the 009 distributor in several T4 powered
&gt; busses over the years,
&gt; and I have been largely satisfied. I installed an
&gt; 009 in my latest baby, a
&gt; 74 Riviera with an 1800 and Weber progressive, and
&gt; drove around quite
&gt; happily. Driving to work every day, going on day
&gt; trips, even a 1200 mile
&gt; weekend trip across four states. I adapted my
&gt; driving style to the
&gt; peculiarities of the beast, I suppose.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, a week ago I installed a Bosch SVDA
&gt; vacuum/centrifugal distributor
&gt; that I bought from John at aircooled_dot_net. I ahve
&gt; seen the light and been
&gt; converted, folks. Smoother takes-offs and gear
&gt; changes, more power on hills
&gt; and, as advertised, an extra 3 MPG in city driving.
&gt; I think it's running a
&gt; tad cooler as well, but it never ran all that hot
&gt; before so it's hard to
&gt; tell.
&gt; 
&gt; At any rate, I urge all you 009-ers out there to
&gt; consider changing
&gt; over--it's worth it. I know that just about any A/C
&gt; VW can be made to run
&gt; pretty well with an 009, but there's a big
&gt; difference between 'pretty well'
&gt; and 'really well.' I'm enjoying 'really well' a lot.
