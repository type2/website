Unfortunately, this is part of the &quot;problem&quot; of dealing with anyone via the
net.  UPS required the Item (a rear hatch with glass) be crated.  I am not
in the parts business and have work among other things on my schedule.  I
simply have not had the time to round up crating materials and build a crate
to ship this.

All it would have taken was  a request for your money back and I would have
issued it immediately (as I've done on my own accord).  I tried to help out
a fellow bus owner, I'm not in the used parts business, I don't ship parts
every day or even every month.  I don't expect something I buy from a
hobbyist to be shipped the next day or usually even the next week.

Obviously Eli was unhappy but chose to &quot;tell the world&quot; instead of me.  I
feel sorry for him but hope that he gets his parts from another source.  I
think I'll just call the crusher to come get this bus.



Guess I know how Ron feels.

Subject: [T2] Sent money got no parts


&gt;
&gt; Steve Reeves (&quot;dubdriver&quot; &lt;reeves32_at_home_dot_com&gt;) recently advertised on this
&gt; mailing list  &quot;[T2] Parting out 77 bus&quot;
&gt;
&gt; I responded with a list of parts i needed and he quickly responded with a
&gt; the parts of those that he had.  After i waited over the weekend to see
&gt; what i could purchase at a local swap meet and finding nothing i emailed
&gt; Steve Reeves back and agreed ed on a price including shipping of
&gt; $73. (seemed to good to be true, should have known) I offered to pay him
&gt; via paypal, he responded with that works best and i transfered $73 into
&gt; his paypal account &quot;Reeves32_at_home_dot_com&quot; the same day.
&gt;
&gt; That was almost the last i heard from Steven Reeves.
&gt;
&gt; After 4 emails over the next 15 days to him about weather or not they had
&gt; been sent as promised i got no response. Odd because before the money was
&gt; transfered he responded to the email often within the hour.
&gt;
&gt; On May 3rd i decided to try contacting him in other ways. I sent him a
&gt; postal mail demanding an explication which i got no response. I also
&gt; found his work phone number via a web site that was in one of his emails
&gt; http://instantsigns_dot_com/.
&gt;
&gt; I called and talked to him and he stated that one box of small parts had
&gt; been sent successfully and the rear hatch he was sending me had been
&gt; returned because of bad packing. That was on May 3rd. No boxes have
arrived
&gt; and i have not hurd from Mr Reeves since.
&gt;
&gt; I have continued to email Mr Reeves at his many email addresses and have
&gt; continued to get on responses.
&gt;
&gt; I have recorded all of the emails, snail mails and the phone call
&gt; between myself and Mr Reeves on my web page to save space, at
&gt; http://zoser.mammoth_dot_org/parts/
&gt; to save repeating them hear.
&gt;
&gt; My point for this email is two fold.
&gt;
&gt; DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM ANYONE NAMED
&gt; Steve Reeves, and be careful of anyone using an email with &quot;reeves&quot; or
&gt; &quot;sing&quot; in there email address. I hope there is no one legitimate
&gt; sellers out there with the name Reeves that will be hurt buy this, but
&gt; better to be safe then sorry.
&gt;
&gt; And also, What can i do to get my money or my parts back. I filled a
&gt; complaint with paypay but I'm sure they are swamped with complaints and
get
&gt; the feeling they don't have time to go though all of them.
&gt;
&gt; thank you all
&gt;
&gt; eli
