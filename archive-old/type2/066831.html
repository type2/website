Tom
I have a few questions about the heaters. There was a discussion some
time back about some propane heaters that used catalitic heat. The general
consensus was that these were not really very safe. I have read the posts
in the archives and I think that these that we are all considering are 
a different unit but I would like a confirmation on this, if you know.

My next question is about the tank. My bus is a non westy and I
do not have a tank. Do you have any idea of the additional cost involved
in this? Is there any way that you can get a firm price on cost of
the heaters ( say within $50) before ordering?

What would the advantage be to spending the $500 on a Propex versus 
a refurbished unit from Ark Mirvis or JB Heaters in Colorado?

Thanks......Chip
