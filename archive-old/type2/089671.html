Subject: Re: [T2] Shift-rod Linkage

Hiya Rick,

I just went through the same thing last week when I replaced the shift 
coupler on my 70 Bus.  That square headed screw can be a real bugger after 
more than twenty years in the same place.  I actually destroyed a nice 8 mm 
end wrench on this job.  Now that was tight!
I did finally get it off.  After wrestling with it for some time and getting 
nowhere I decided to use some penetrant on it.  Used PB Blaster.  Sprayed it 
and resprayed every hour for four hours.  Then back to the wrench.  That did 
it.
I came away from the event deciding to buy an 8mm metric square headed socket 
for just this job.  Seems that one can get quite a bit more leverage with the 
wratchet/socket combo than with an end wrench.  You might want to try that 
avenue.
