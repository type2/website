It's just one thing after another this week.

My bus (74, 1.8 ltr) has been sitting for 3 days while I repaired the
ignition switch. I just started it and now there's a loud valve clatter,
sounds like #1 or #2. This engine has just over 1000 miles on it since AVP
built the long block. (Came with the bus; purchased by the PO) It has
hydraulic lifters, which is a first for me in a VW. I let it run for a few
minutes to see if it would quiet down but no luck. Once it's cooled off I'm
going to check the valve adjustment to see if it's just a loosened adjusting
screw. (hope, hope!)

Question is: A) Can I replace the bad lifter without removing the engine?
and B) Can I replace the hydraulic lifters with solid lifters without
replacing the cam shaft? I assume I'd need the solid lifters and the correct
push rods and a set of push rod seals. Can it be done, or would I have to
split the case?

Thanks,
Dave
