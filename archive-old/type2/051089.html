Subject: [T2] Bay-window belly pan

Can anyone tell if all the bay-windows came with belly pans or was that just 
on the split-windows? Mine doesnt have one and I don't know if it had one at 
one time and just fell off or what. When doing resto's do a lot of people 
bother with the belly pan ?


Thanks for the info,

Dave
