Listees-

A friend of mine is selling his '67 Westy, and I've put up some
information and pictures on my web page. If you're interested, take a look
at http://www.insync_dot_net/~kittman/mikebus. 

Also, has anyone seen Pleasantville and noticed the splitty single cab?
The TV repair guy was driving it. My wife and I were suprised at the
cameo. It looked great.
