&gt;I may have misquoted the GBC - I was typing from memory.  Read the

Thanks for the reference - Here's a direct link:

Hmmm... interesting reading, but I take issue with some of his conclusions, 
such as where he states that more weight on the pulley end equalizes weight 
and &quot;stops crank twist&quot;.  Like every other statement on that page, it has 
no hard data to back it up, just a reference to &quot;good common sense&quot;.  I 
also notice that he says there is no need for the heavy pulley with a stock 
engine, which I certainly believe.

How's this for a scientific proof:

&quot;The light pulley allows the nodes (vibration like a guitar string) to 
travel up the crank from the pulley end to the flywheel end of the 
crankshaft. Naturally, the flywheel stops this node at that point 
transferring it into the case. By adding the extra weight to the pulley end 
with our heavy pulley it stops this from occurring, no longer being sent to 
the flywheel end.&quot;

I know, who am I to dump on Gene Berg like that?  Maybe his stuff really is 
good - I can't say, but I've had enough education to be offended by the 
above paragraph, not to mention his disclaimer about 72-and-up US-spec 
busses which he won't touch with a ten-foot pole.

Here's a post I found on dejanews_dot_com.  Tried to verify it on Gene Berg's 
web site but couldn't find anything recommending GL-5 oil.  I see I also 
disagree with him on the use of synthetic oil.  Finally, Gene Berg seems to 
think that the 009 is the cat's meow.  I guess I just don't understand his 
philosophy.

&gt;
&gt;&quot;You need GL4 type for old Volkswagens.  Most folks will try to
&gt;sell you GL5, which is the present-day standard.  Unfortunately,
&gt;Volkswagens started using cheap aluminum-phosphor-bronze synchro
&gt;rings about 1958 and GL5 contains additives that cause the synchros to
&gt;corrode.  So be sure to use the right stuff.  Every two years.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;It's up to you.  You're the Mechanic-in-Charge.

&gt; &gt;  In the Gene Berg Parts Catalog and Technical Manual the late Gene Berg
&gt; &gt; recommends using GL-5  75 w90 synthetic gear oil  for Type I 
&gt; transaxles.  He
&gt; &gt; says using it will give the longest life, best  shifting, and best mpg.
&gt; &gt;   I have been using it since 1992 without any trouble. When I used 
&gt; conventional
&gt; &gt; 80 w90 GL-5 Castrol gear oil I had trouble shifting in cold weather. 
&gt; Also there
&gt; &gt; would be a slight growling noise which went away when  it reached operating
&gt; &gt; temperature.
&gt; &gt;   When using Castrol synthetic 75 w90 GL-5 gear oil in the transaxle, cold
&gt; &gt; weather shifting was a lot easier and no problem at all when ithe 
&gt; transaxle had
&gt; &gt; warmed up.
&gt; &gt;   Also the slight growling completely went away except on really 
&gt; extreme cold
&gt; &gt; mornings,to me that about 20 to 25 F not counting wind chill and even 
&gt; then the
&gt; &gt; growling wasnt too bad.
&gt; &gt;   It might be normal for them to growl a little when they`re cold.
&gt; &gt;   Gene Berg says not to use synthetic oil in your engine and that 
&gt; conventional
&gt; &gt; oil cools beter than synthetic oil. Besides if you`re changing your 
&gt; aircooled
&gt; &gt; engines oil every 1500 to 2000 miles, its cheaper to use conventional 
&gt; oil in
&gt; &gt; your engine.
&gt; &gt;   I called Gene Berg on a few different occassions. He recommende
&gt; &gt; usingconventional 10 w30 oil in the engine.
&gt; &gt;   On the average most people Ive talked to use 20 w50 in their Type I`s.
&gt; &gt;   I prefer using straight weight 30HD whenever possible.
&gt; &gt;   Sorry I got off the subject.
&gt; &gt;   But evidently its OK to use synthetic 75 w90 gear oil in the transaxle.
