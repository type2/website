&gt;Does anyone have any experience with the Automatic transmission that was

No worries.

&gt;This is a california bus, so I think it will need to be able to pass smog
&gt;for the next 4 years, but I oculd be wrong.

You can always get a bus to pass but the cost ranges from $0-hundreds or more. The way the recent smog legislation is shaping up 1976-up won't ever be exempt.

&gt;what I am looking for is a bus for a bus-newbie. I am looking for
&gt;something to tinker withI am familiar with engines, and am not afraid to
&gt;tear into one, but is this a good starting bus?

Sure.
