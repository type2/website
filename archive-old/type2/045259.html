&gt;Or, if you're like me, you just use a narrow hose clamp to do the same
&gt;job.  Just tighten it a bit, not till the rubber is extruding through the
&gt;holes.

I regularly use a GOOD quality cable tie on the small end tightened about
like George says with a hose clamp, faster and easier.  I've had these in
service for over 10 years without failure.  You need to watch and use a tie
with a low profile clasp area that won't gouge the boot at extreme axle
angles, a problem even worse with the small hose clamp solution, though
you don't operate at such conditions very often.

&gt;Others just leave the small clamp off altogether.  the rubber seems to be
&gt;fine at sealing, and some claim that this extends boot life.

Well I think personally something is needed, this depends sort of on the
boot though.  Real German rubber boots seem to fit looser and break down
faster (although still slowly) than a good quality poly boot.  For either when
that end gets loose and starts working up and down the axle, dirt and water
get in.

A total aside is that some styles of VW FWD boots with the same bolt
pattern fit and feature integral metal crimp rings in the rubber boot.  These
go about $20 a pop though wholesale, seems to me Quantums and other Audi
derived cars often featured the better boot.
&gt;
&gt;Make your pick, and take your chances!

Exactly.
