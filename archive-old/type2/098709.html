&gt; I'm with you Matt, sounds like the same crapola of batteries that will

&gt; out of shape by now.

Even worse, storing one on end increases the chance that it will tip over,
causing it to be bent by the impact.

also. each crank throw will have a moment in it when stored vertically, so
that doesn't stop it from bending!
