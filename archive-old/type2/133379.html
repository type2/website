&gt; Okay, I've resorted to begging.  I've spent the last year having my '73
&gt; camper restored and I'm stuck on one thing - I need the linkage that runs
&gt; from the gear shifter to the transmission.  It's an automatic which I now
&gt; know I should've coverted her to a manual when I had the chance but I've
&gt; already spent a small fortune having the transmission rebuilt so I'm kinda
&gt; stuck keeping her an automatic.

are you referring to the rod or the cable??

&gt; Anyways, if anyone is parting out an automatic between '73 and '75 or knows
&gt; of a yard that has automatics or has a diagram that has specific details
&gt; about the linkage - I'd greatly appreciate it!

there is a guy in the UK that is parting out a 73 auto tranny that posted
on the list a couple days ago.  shipping the cable should not be too
expensive.

if you find one grab it, and remove em carefull too.

73-75 and 75+ are different so make sure to get the right one.

I could use a 75+ cable if you stumble across one
