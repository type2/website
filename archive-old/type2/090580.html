Subject: Re: [T2] pop top add on

Ahhh if you have a sun roof this doesnt apply I agree.
Also if you want to cut a hole and do some welding
have at it. But the add on that I was refering to
is easy to do and keeps the bus in it's original
configuration... If that is important to you.....
  I have a sun roof so I dont have to worry about it.
I just have noticed that the factory pop tops and sun
roof buses have more meat up there... must be a
reason.
Sun roof buses are harder to find then the hard tops.
