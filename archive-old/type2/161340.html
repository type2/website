Subject: Re: [T2] I got the wrong part!

As a business owner it is very hurtful to us when an employee, or  
myself makes a mistake. Having it broadcasted is part of doing  
business, but I think in all fairness, you owe it to the owner of the  
company to contact him first to decide wether you trust him to make  
it up to you before you ask others to decide for you. We can all  
sympathize with your need for the correct part the first time... but  
we all make mistakes.

Now that you have publicly slighted the Bus Depot... I wonder if you  
will remember to post all the good things that company has done for  
you in the past, and if you didnt do business with them before, and  
they do rectify the situation, will you remember to post  they  
handled your situation admirably?

Not meaning to come down on you personally, this is a pet peave of  
mine. Usually the customer doesnt  realize how personal and hurtful  
things like this are.
