&gt; I think you have the last statement backwards.  With your previous, smaller
&gt; tires the speedo would have been reading even faster than it is now, not
&gt; slower.  I found that with extremely large 14&quot; tires on my bus (27x8.5 BFG
&gt; All-Terrain TA) it *still* reads about 2% fast.

Whoops right, got it basackwards!
