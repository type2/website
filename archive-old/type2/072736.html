Sounds like a bad cold start valve or thermotime switch.

Disconnect main coil wire to dizzy.  Put test lamp on plug to coldstart.
Have someone operate starter motor while you check the test lamp.  Should
lite up on a cold engine.  If it doesn't check terminal # 86 on the double
relay to see if there is power.  If both of the above are ok, pull the cold
start valve and see if its squirting.

Have fun
