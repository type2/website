Subject: Re: help with wiring a VDO tach

I had this problem not so long ago. The list send me this: for the erratic
tach and wiring!

(1) Purchase a diode #1N4005 from your local electronics store i.e. Radio
Shack.

(2) Cut both ends of the diode so each is approx. ¾ inch long.

(3) Crimp ¼ inch female spade connector on the end of the diode with the
silver band.
(4) Crimp butt-splice connector on the other end of the diode.
(5) Crimp the opposite end of butt-splice connector to the wire connected to
ignition signal source.
(6) Connect ¼ in female spade connector used in #3 above to terminal #4 on
the back of the tachometer.
(7) Attach a ground (-) wire to terminal #3.
(8) Attach a switched 12-volt Power wire to terminal #2.
(9) Set switches for the appropriate amount of cylinders.

&gt; Greetings,
&gt;
&gt; Picked up a VDO Cockpit tach unused in original box but without wiring or
instructions. The back of the tach has 4 horizontal terminals labeled above
as following:
&gt;
&gt;           +   24W   12W   -
&gt;
&gt; anyone know how to wire up the tach to a stock 1600 engine? Do I need to
get any special diodes or senders?
&gt;
&gt; thanks
&gt;
&gt; Greg
