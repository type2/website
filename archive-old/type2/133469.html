&gt; No takers on this question, so I'll step up.

don't remember seeing the question so I'll take a plug, I have braided
Metal high presure metal lines on my bus...if this is what you mean by
&quot;Braided&quot; I got them from a heavy equipment hydraulic hose repair company
(Langsdale-Holtsman) they are warranted to something like 3,000psi and
impervious to everything.  they also were outragously expensive, over $1 a
foot.  they have worked for a number of years without any sign of wear.
but they are dangerous, because when you cut them there are all these
little sharp stainless steel wires that HURT when you get stuck.

&gt; I recommend sticking with good quality conti-tech cloth covered 5mm fuel
&gt; hose and OE style crimped-on hose clips. Most good vendors have the 5mm hose
&gt; for sale, but no-one else that I am aware of sells the OE style crimp hose
&gt;
&gt; Using braided steel lines is a good idea on paper, but it is difficult to
&gt; install these lines, in fact it is far more difficult to get a really

that is the understatement of the century.   if I had known how hard they
were when I started I doubt I would have even attempted them...

&gt; style hoses. It is all very do-able, but I repeat that it will be more
&gt; difficult to get a perfect job with this type of line, to say nothing of the
&gt; cost, which will be very high relative to OE hose.

yup!!!!
