&gt; &gt; We arein the process of doing a late model canvas in the shop
&gt; and the old
&gt; &gt; stapler isn't cutting it. What kind of stapler is best suited for this
&gt; &gt; task(read as is there a stapler that will kill me if I use it wrong?)
&gt; &gt; Thanks

&gt;
&gt; Charles,
&gt;
&gt; I have used an air stapler with good results. The best thing is that by
&gt; regulating the amount of air pressure you control the depth of the staples
&gt; in the work. Too much pressure and they will go clear through the plastic
&gt; strip.
