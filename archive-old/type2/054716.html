Subject: Re: removing alternator on 1600 engine?

unless you have dual carbs, the first step is to REMOVE THE ENGINE. &quot;Advice&quot;
telling you how to do it with the engine in the vehicle is suspect, since
there is NO way in hell you can adequately tighten the fan's nut working as
a Heart Surgeon in that engine bay.

It's an easy job with the engine out, and you can inspect the clutch and
some other components at the same time.
