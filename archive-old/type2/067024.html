Truckers use their lights as signals. Turning off the lights signals 
it's OK to pull over. High beam signals they are too close.

SO I wrote:

Um, let's see. Am I missing something? A trucker turns on his high beams to 
tell the person behind him that there's someone coming the other way too close?
Doesn't that mean that he switches his highbeams on into the face of an oncoming
vehicle that is getting close? This is courtesy? If I were the concoming car, I 
would not like this arrangment.

Clear this up for me someone?
