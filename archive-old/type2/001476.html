Found a 73 bus at a yard today. It is only the second NON walk-thru I have
seen in 5 years [not counting a strange 69 Westy with the cabinets across
the bulkhead]. This bus has a 2/3 passenger seat. Is it the same as a 68 and
up single/dual cab?
Right now this 73 is complete. The only thing missing on the engine is the
aux. pulley that bolts on the fan hub. The smog pump is there but a little
rough when turned by hand. Carbs are still there.
Anyone need/want anything from it?
