Subject: 78 riviera for sale

--part1_de.2b6efba1.2a88365a_boundary

Howdy folks, I am in a position where I need to sell my 78 ASI Riviera. 

This is an extremely nice little bus, very reliable and the best &quot;driving&quot; 
bus I have ever owned. It is white on white, new paint, strong motor, quiet 
transmission, new brakes, good tires, new front shocks, perfect canvas, you 
name it. Overall a great camper. 

To balance the equation here are the issues with this vehicle- rear seat and 
center seat upholstery is unraveling in a corner, leaks oil from the center 
seam (wow that's a new one;-), Coleman furnace is complete but I removed it 
from the bus to gain storage. That's about it.

Some of the extras that come with Riv's- Norcold fridge still can make ice, 
removable stove, water tank and pump, dual battery, table, cruise control, 
gray water tank. I added a tach, oil temp, pressure and a clock. 

A few things I am including - extra 2.0 liter engine with full FI components, 
extra transmission (done by Transform a few years ago) all of the AC stuff I 
pulled out and a box of various parts. 

I bought it from the original family in California and moved it to Utah. I 
replaced the heads, pistons and cylinders about 13000 miles ago and it has 
been perfect. I have most of the original documentation and history. 

This bus is in Salt Lake City Utah and I will travel to meet part way. 

I am asking around $3500 for my whole Air Cooled world, I may even include 
some things from my &quot;Motorcycle&quot; world. It's time to move in a slightly 
different direction. 

If you would like more information you can e-mail me at cmpbiker_at_aol_dot_com or 
call me at 801 301 6786.

Thanks,
Clay Perry
