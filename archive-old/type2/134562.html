Subject: Re: [T2] MSquirt in an upright?

Well, you've done it again, Richard! With the number of FI components I've 
been collecting from donor buses increasing, this was just the information I 
needed to start sorting out what I have and what works with what.

About all these nifty pages you send out to the list from time to time.... 
Are these all accessable by clicking through links from your home page?

Thanks,

John
