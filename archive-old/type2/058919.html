Subject: Re: Oil Temp. Sender Install?

Can anyone direct me towards info on installing an Oil Temp. sender in a
&gt; '78 2.0L FI T4 engine? 

i recently installed a sender in my '78 w/o any problems...just drain the oil, pull off the oil sender plate (not the sump plate), drill the proper size hole and thread in the sender. complete instructions are included w/the gauge if you're using VDO, and the gauge fits nicely under the stereo cutout.

words of caution: the sender is brass and it *will* strip if overtightened. also, i had to use some silicone to prevent leaking.

one final thought: temp gauges are a *great* idea, but on a hot texas day they're really depressing!
