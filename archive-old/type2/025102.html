Subject: tricks when removing Type4 motor
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I got &quot; volunteered&quot; to help my friend pull the motor in his 72 bus.....
it needs the heads done......

I know how to do it but was wondereng if there any tricks to make it easier, 

years ago I pulled the heater boxes and exhaust while it was mounted in the 
car,
it made the motor much lighter and easier to move around.......

any other ideas ?
