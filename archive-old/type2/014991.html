&gt;Second, it looks like the top schematic of the &quot;49 states&quot; 1979 exhaust 
&gt;could be adapted to 75-78 vehicles, using 72-74 heat exchangers -- either 
&gt;straight, or with a modification in the crossover tube. But I have never 
&gt;seen one of these. Are they, uhm, less than abundant?

Mark, I think the exhaust ports for the '79 HE/heads are more square than
the earlier ports, if I remember right, so they have to match as a set. I
could be mistaken. As an aside, I have what I believe are a bunch of the
'79-81 seals that go between the HE's and heads. I don't think they're
scarce, but if they are, someone holler. I don't mind sharing. :)

FWIW, I put '72 HE's and exhaust on my '77 FI engine, but I'm using 1800
heads. I would think pre-79 heads would allow you to use these earlier HE's
and the earlier, less expensive exhaust. This may require creative
placement of the oxygen sensor and if you use the EGR valve, you'd have to
fabricate a port for that too, I think.

BTW, the reason I went to the '72 HE's/exhaust is that the later exhaust is
very expensive and difficult to find parts for.

Thanks and good luck! Joe
