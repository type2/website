Subject: Re: [T2] Engine hatch bove engine?

Paul,

Don't know about the UK, but the Oz delivery busses from '74, at least, had the 
hatch in the rear deck above the engine bay, for access to the carbs.

The picture in the link below SORT of shows the hatch.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; A quick question. In John Muirs book (How To Keep Your Volks Alive) he
&gt; swiftly mentions a hatch above the engine bay in post '75 buses which can be
&gt; opened for easy access to the engine. I've never heard of one and my '75 bus
&gt; does not have one, is this a mith or is my bus from before they were
&gt; introduced?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; 
&gt; Paul.
