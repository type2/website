Listees

Thanks to all those who responded to the survey. I got almost as many
suggestions of the best tool as responses. I guess it goes to show the
diversity of work the listees are doing on their campers.

So, here are the results:

1st=    (3 votes)       Duct tape
1st=    (3 votes)       Battery lantern (various different styles
recommended, ie. fluorescent)
3rd=    (2 votes)       Floor (trolley) jack
3rd=    (2 votes)       The type 2 list! (and its archives)

Lots of other suggestions, noteworthy ones include types of long-reach
part-grabber/magnet/mirror, vise grips, crescent-moon spanners (you know,
the type shaped like a C) and a Swiss army knife.

So it looks like the novice mechanic should start out with a lamp, Duct
tape, a trolley jack, a set of crescent moon spanners, vise grips, a Swiss
army knife and join this list!

I did this survey partly out of curiosity and also because I recently had
all my tools stolen from the back of the other van (while it was at a
garage having warranty work undertaken) so I've had to go out and buy a
whole load of new tools. I was wondering what others found useful and
conversely, which ones are not that important. I don't know if I'll ever be
compensated properly or collect all the tools I had, such as 'that little
ribbed spatula which was just the right size for plugging the fuel line
when the engine is out', etc...

I'll send it on.
