Subject: Re: [T2] Westy Interior Panel Patterns


&gt;
&gt;The issue regarding available plywood material sizes has been with us for a
&gt;while, but it's good to know there is a source for oversized sheets.  Anyone
&gt;have contact info on Harbor Sales?
&gt;
&gt;Another option I have considered is to join pieces of 1/8&quot; ply to make the
&gt;larger pieces required.  This could be done by jointing (using a jointer
&gt;plane or motorized jointer) the edges to be joined and then backing the
&gt;joint with a strip of 1/8&quot; ply, 1&quot; wide or so.  The backing strip would have
&gt;to be held back in some areas where it would interfere with the underlying
&gt;structure of the bus.

They have it:  http://www.aircraftspruce_dot_com/main.html

And a great free catalog. (They'll make their money off of me when i buy 
another set of engine instruments).

I have a decent cab ceiling  panel that is ugly to look. I think I'll cover 
mine with a 1/4&quot; of foam, and then with a layer of upholstery same as my 
seat covers (whatever material that will be). This is the same technique as 
making door panels.

I thought of this too but... you can't use a biscuit joiner (that i know 
of) . I have a DeWalt (nice machine) and you really need 1/2&quot; of wood 
thickness to use biscuits. I just checked with a local specialty wood 
supplier and they report they can get 5x5 foot panels and 4x10 foot panels 
BUT the thinnest is 1/2&quot;.

I had considered making two panels, and then (covering the central joint) 
running front to back on the visible side, a nice 4&quot; wide piece of wood 
with a design carved in it - like router cut grooves or something. Maybe a 
place added to hide that CB radio that doesn't get used much...

I think you could also simply laminate the seam on the non-visible side 
with another thin peice of the panelling and use gorilla glue and some 
filler and some careful sanding to create a seam that was almost invisible. 
I would try to add 8 tiny diameter screws in there too.
