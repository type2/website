Subject: Re: no title for my bus

Some states only require a bill of sale or a tag receipt for vehicles over a 
certain age because they  dont even have a title. GA and AL are two that are 
like that. Florida SUCKS when it comes to these things.

Just make sure that the VIN number that is on the paper work you have 
matches what actually is on the vehicle and NOT just whats on the little 
removable tags. Look at the numbers that are actually stamped into the metal 
on the bus.

Been there, done that, got SCREWED by a person in Fayetteville NC and he 
refused to help me out.

Email me off list if you want any more info. I had to do a lot of research 
when this happened.

&gt;
&gt;When I bought my camper , it was from some Antique auto dealer and all I 
&gt;got
&gt;was a bill of sale and no title. He said it wouldn't be a problem. Is there
&gt;any reason why I would have a problem (like registering it when I get it 
&gt;all
&gt;fixed up) Why is the title important???
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for the info!
