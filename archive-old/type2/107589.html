Subject: RE: [T2] ECU update

Bentley shows these grounds associated with the FI:

-Pins 5,16,17
-Dizzy to Coil (-)
-Solenoid (Ground strap to starter)
-Starter (I think this is provided by being bolted to the bell housing)
-Fuel Pump
-Battery
-Double Relay (This should go under one of the screws holding the relays to
tin)
-Throttle Valve Switch (If you have one, but I think these were pre-1977)

The backup light connectors shouldn't create a FI issue.

When you crank, do you get any hint of starting, or just nothing at all? Are
you sure the distributor is firing in the right order and at the right time?

&lt;SNIP&gt;
I cleaned off the ground wires that I know of again to try and get the EFI
to spray gas when the engine was cranked. Still no luck.
When I tested the ECU connector correctly with the test light on terminals
10 to 5, 10 to 16 and 10 to 17 all light up properly. And it flickers when
engine cranked over and connect to terminal 1.
I still think I have a ground problem, if not I'm thinking I might need a
new ECU as rare as those things go bad.

I crawled under the bus and checked the ground strap from the chasis to the
transmission and it is ok. The two wires (along with the switch/terminal)
(for the reverse lights, I think) going to the front left side of the tranny
are in pretty sad shape and I am going to replace it all.
Would this cause problems for the Fuel Injection?

My main question is:
Can somebody tell me where all of the ground wires for the electronic fuel
injection are so that I can make sure I check them all?
(3 under air intake, one to neg terminal of solenoid, and where else???)
