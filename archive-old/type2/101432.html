I have a BA4 so somethings might be a little different but

&gt; I then installed a low pressure after market purolator pump, about 2-4psi inline and then the heater would ignite and run but now only for about 10 mins or so and it shuts down. Maybe now it is getting too much fuel. Is there a better way to route the fuel lines to the heater fuel pump on the FI buses? Or possibly would the purolator fuel pump suffice to run the heater by itself? Has anyone used an aftermarket fuel pump to

the heaters use a pulse fuel pump, it sends a metered pulse of fuel every
time it gets a signal from the heater...a regular fuel pump would give it
far too much fuel.   the pulse is created by the blower motor and it fires
the spark plug at the same time,  I don't remember the number of RPMs but
33 seems to ring a bell, so every 33 times the blower motor turns it
triggers a single measured pulse of fuel and a spark at the same time
