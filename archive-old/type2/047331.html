&gt;     From what I hear, 1974 had 1700 engines. I have a dual carbed 1700 engine with an automatic tranny. This setup is completely bone stock!!!

My Stock 1974 California spec'd manual transmission had the 1800 dual carb.  I understand the only FI 1800s in 1974 were the California spec
automatic bus.
