Ray &amp; Pat’s Great Mexican Ferry Boat Adventure....Chapter 2

Howdy from down Mexico way...

As requested by the Ferry Boat company, we showed up bright &amp; early 6 AM
on Tuesday the 23rd, to begin the loading process of our 73 'Westy'.

About 6:30 AM, Victor, the guy in charge had all of the transit
vehicles, line up for the'official' measuring and weighing-in process...as
the transit price is based on the length of your vehicle, Victor takes his
old, worn out, rusty tape and shows you where to hold it in the front of
your
vehicle...the tape is so worn at the beginning, that he uses a point about
12 inches from the end and tells you &quot;here is zero&quot;!..Ray fixed him, though,
as he unrolled the tape and walked to the rear of our bus, Ray just
'adjusted'
the 12 inches to the rear of where we started...we were under 5 meters,which
was the lowest rate (about $150), but, as you'll see below, old Victor was
trying his best to get us into the next class and about another $50!...we
weighed in at 1,870 Kilos or about 4,200lbs...

After weigh-in, we were assigned a lane to await actual loading &quot;in just a
few minutes&quot;...as we waited, we noticed the Mexican trucks were 'backing'
down into their lanes...closer inspection of our 200 ft vessel, showed that
it had hatches and ramps at both ends, but the hatch in the aft portion of
the ferry appeared to be welded shut!...I guess it's too difficult for the
ferry driver to 'back' the ferry into the dock so we all can drive right
onto the boat...in Mexico, you just drive the boat forward onto the dock
ramps, and have all the vehicles 'back' onto the ferry - easy, right -
except for those long 18 wheeler semi's (there were 3) and the poor Bread
Truck 18 wheeler who had a rear trailer on a dolly, and jack knifed about
every 20 ft as he tried to back down...they made him the last vehicle to be
loaded...the first truck onto the ferry, was of course the Corona Beer
Agency Truck - this being a regular trip for him, we suppose, plus we
noticed
several rather 'accessible' cases of ‘product’ at the rear of his load...

Also while we waited on the docks, we met a retired couple, Jim &amp; Lynn, from
Utah who were on their way to Bahia de Concepcion, about 20 miles below
Mulege in Baja (one of the places we hoped to visit) where they ‘owned’ a
beach-side Palapa/cabin... Jim &amp; Lynn were driving a pickup with a large
camper installed...Jim told us that their rig measured 6.7 Meters in length,
but Victor asked if him &quot;would you like it to come within 6.5 meters, for
the cheaper rate?&quot;...Jim, being another bright Gringo, whipped out 150 pesos
to make sure the 'correct' numbers were entered on the form (this 150 peso
'fee' saved Jim &amp; Lynn about 800 pesos! - or about $80 bucks at the current
10peso/dollar rate).  As we continued to wait our ‘few minutes’ a big truck
full of Federales arrived with a drug sniffing dog to 'shake down' our
vehicles...first, they asked if they could check inside our bus - you bet -
then they asked if we had any guns or drugs inside - as we recall, we
answered 'no' to the above...

As the backward loading process progressed,
our 9 AM departure time slipped into more like 10 AM...as we backed down, we
were asked for our vehicle 'ticket' form that we had purchased after
the weigh-in...the 'ticket taker' had been taking tickets all morning
without much of a look at each form - until we arrived - he took our ticket,
a 3-part computer form and looked at the copies, then looked again, and
again, finally decided which copy looked OK to him and let us proceed
(mighty strange I thought)...after loading our bus, We had to walk back
out and down the loading ramp to find the passenger ramp to get back onto
the Ferry...the ticket agent at this ramp took our two (same type 3-part
form) tickets and looked them over, looked again, and again, finally
selecting the copy that seemed to their liking after a brief discussion with
another 'official' nearby (strange, again, as all the other passengers just
'breezed' by on their way aboard)...several hours
later, half way across the 'Cortez&quot; the mystery was solved, as an official
on the ferry came by asking for Senor Cellar...it seems the agent at the
ticket window where we bought our tickets, forgot to keep his copy of our
3-part form, causing all the 'confusion'...ah, Mexico!

The Ferry had a bar and restaurant on board, but we brought our ice chest
full of 'goodies' to enjoy during the 7 hour passage...the Cortez was rather
calm as we left Guaymas, but became a little 'bumpy' as we ran towards Baja
and Santa Rosalia...the 'bumps' turned into about 6 ft swells with white
caps the last couple of hours of the voyage...We spent the trip up on
the boat deck, aft, during most of the trip, and avoided the regular
passenger compartment below as the normal Mexican crowd and their usual
baggage and bag lunches made for some rather unusual 'aromas' down there!...

When we approached Santa Rosalia, our boat driver tried to make it inside
the small breakwater several times in the gusty weather, without
success...after almost an hours wait, bouncing around off the harbor, a
local pilot was transported to the ferry in a small panga (an open type, 20
ft outboard Mexican fishing boat)...as the pilot took over, we made a '360'
and headed right through the breakwater and over to the Ferry landing!
After being tied to the docks, we began to off load our vehicles...all the
trucks had been chained to the deck and nearby bulkheads inside the
ferry...we were herded onto the landing in several lanes again, where more
Federales gave us another 'shakedown' for drugs and guns...lucky for us, we
had thrown all our contraband overboard during the passage and thus avoided
a 'stay' in the Baja Pokie!...we gringos got several laughs out of the logic
of this 2nd 'inspection', like we were going to suddenly acquire guns and
drugs on the way over!...or maybe the Baja Federales get brownie points if
they find something the Guaymas troops miss!...

Well, anyway, our 7 hour ferry trip took from 6AM, till we drove away in
Santa Rosalia at about 5 PM or an 11 hour adventure...great fun, but most of
us agreed we’d pass up the opportunity next time!

We were now loose on Baja, and proceeded south to the small village of
Mulege for a night of rest...the moon was almost full, the air was clear,
the evening was cool, and the 'sundowners' we poured, chased the salt from
our throats as we regained our landlubber's bearings and planned the next
chapter of our Baja adventure...

Hasta la Bye, Bye...
Ray &amp; Pat
