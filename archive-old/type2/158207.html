Subject: Wiring Harness Fabrication

I have to rebuild the wiring harness that connects the alternator to the
rest of the bus.  I am having some trouble removing the contacts from the
plastic 3 conductor plugs.

Anyone have any pointers?  I am not really sure which way to shove the
screwdriver in to disengage the retainers that keep the female plugs in.
