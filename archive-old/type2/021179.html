Subject: AIRS report - weekend well spent

So I get home a little after 5 from work on Saturday.  A friend of mine 
says that some guys called from Green Bay saying they had my name off of 
the internet and had some questions regarding their bus.  This got me 
curious, and the number on the caller ID just came up as unavailable.. 
dern.  I check my email and a couple minutes after that I get a phone 
call from these guys.  They had come to town and were at the place where 
I work as my friend told them I was at work still when they called 
before.  They said they had a 71 bus and it was leaking some oil and 
running a little rough.  Thats about all they got out before I said &quot;be 
there in 10 minutes&quot;

I was there 10 minutes later loaded with tools even (took some home from 
work that night knowing i was going to work on the 62)  They introduce 
themselves and we pull the bus around back and get crackin.  The bus was 
running a little rough and not idling just right.  I poppled off the 
dist cap and noticed by looking at the points that they were not gapped 
enough.  A .016 feeler gauge and screwdriver later the engine was 
running like a top.  Now for the oil leak.  They said they were going 
through about a quart a day, but they were also driving 400 miles a day. 
  Thats a good bit of oil to go through.  Upon further inspection it 
looks as if its coming from behind the crank pulley.  Not too much I 
could do about it, but I said switch to a thicker oil and that could 
help out a bit.  They'll do that tomorrow or the next day they say.  So 
we get to talking and I asked if they needed a place to stay or 
something.  They accepted.  We hopped on over to my house and they were 
looking at the 62 in the garage as I went in and got some loot and 
clothes and what not.  We went and picked up a fuel filter, then headed 
over to our shop (a few guys in town have a private shop where we 
store/work on cars, get together, just hang around etc)  We drove around 
a bit and I showed them the town and we went and picked up some 
beverages for the night.  Got back to the shop and started talking some 
more and doing a bit of drumming (hand drums are also made at the 
shop)...  We talked about their travels and their plans and what brought 
them to get a bus.  Well, they're two college guys from Nebraska who 
wanted to go on a trip for the summer as they had been taking trips up 
to canada, colorado, montana etc in a &quot;normal&quot; car just for fun.  They 
wanted to make a big trip out of it and decided to buy a bus for the 
occasion.  They picked a *nice* bus!  Its a red/white 71 bus with a 
moderate amount of gear in it.  It has a nice engine and the nicest 
looking underside I've seen on a bus in a long time.  They got it for a 
real good price and put an alternator on the engine and did a few other 
things before they left on the trip.  They had been on the road for a 
week.  So we pulled the buses around the back of the shop and set up. 
They moved their stuff around so they could sleep in the bus, and I 
pulled out the bed in my bus and decided to camp there for the night. 
It was a beautiful night for sleeping.  We went back in and did a bit of 
drumming and got to talking some more.  There were a couple of other 
minor things they wanted me to look at, so we agreed to take care of it 
in the morning...  So a handfull of bottle caps later we went to bed.

Got up in the morning sweating (sleeping bag with the sun beating down 
on me, i hate that) and decided to head home for a bit to take a shower. 
  We headed back to my place and everyone cleaned up, then we headed 
around town and met a few of the local bus nuts, picked up some grub, 
and back to the shop.  I crawl under the bus just looking around and 
notice the backing plate on the right rear is wet on the bottom.  Uh oh 
me says.  I jack up the bus and pull of the drum and sure enough, its 
soaked.  Real leaky wheel cylinder.  Hmmm, called up the parts places in 
town that were open, and nobody can get one until Tuesday.  I called up 
a few of the local bus guys and nobody has a new one on hand.  So I 
figure that a used good one is better than a leaky one.  I pulled one 
off of a backing plate I had (67 even) and went back over to the shop, 
but not before stopping and picking up some miracle-in-a-can.  Some of 
you refer to it as brake parts cleaner.  Personally, I worship the 
stuff.  The good stuff that is.  Anyways, we get back, and I tear into 
it and replace it.  Then we bleed the brakes, use the brakes some, and 
tear off the drum again to verify it isn't leaking.  No leaks, good 
news.  Spray the shoes down with the brake parts cleaner, and rough em 
up with some sandpaper and all is well.

After thats all done we head on over the the engine.  It seemed as if it 
were running a bit rich, so I adjusted the carb per the Bentley manual. 
  It seemed to help a bit.  Checked over the engine, checked the timing, 
etc.  I also put hose clamps on every fuel line connection (they were 
missing a couple) and also put a safety wire on the fuel inlet to the 
carb.  I've had this come out on me before.  It is *not* fun.

We cooked up some burgers in the mean time, talked some more, drove 
around a bit more, and checked out each others buses.  I took some 
pictures even.  All too soon they were on their way out.  They were 
headed to Milwaukee, then Chicago, and who knows where from there. 
They've just been staying at campground, wal mart parking lots, etc and 
loving every bit of it.  They have to be back to school the 24th of 
August and they plan to travel until whenever they feel like stopping. 
They're headed to the east coast and just taking their time and taking 
everything in.
I believe they even posted to the list before they left when they got 
the bus.  I'm not sure though as I haven't been up on all the posts (T2 
list) as of late.  Nick and Jason are their names.
If these guys call on you, or you see them in their bus, by all means 
stop and say hi.  They're great guys.  I wish I got more calls like this 
from the AIRS list.  Once we got to talking it was like we were old 
friends.  I could have left $500 cash on the table and left them when I 
went to the gas station or something and been completely comfortable 
with it.  These are good and honest guys just out looking to have some 
fun.  Oh yeah, they needed some tunes for their bus, so we gave em a 
radio and some speakers.  They've just been enjoying the hum of the 
engine till now enjoying the sights and sounds and just going wherever 
they feel :)

It was tempting to pack up ol Stella and join in on the trip! But, 
obviously I didn't.  I (and I'm sure many others!) would love to do 
something like this.  These guys are actually doing it.  They've got a 
good bus to go with, and the best of intentions.  These are new VW 
owners, but they went over the bus pretty well before they left, and 
havea pretty good basic understanding of things.  They carried a few 
spare parts (I donated a clutch cable to the cause as they were without 
one) and tools so they've the right idea!

When I came home from work I had nothing but a boring weekend face. 
After this my weekend we well spent.  Thanks for the company guys, and I 
wish you the best of luck on your trip!!

Sorry if any of this was rambling :)
