Subject: Re: [T2] CV Joint  what is this part called

&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; I just installed a rebuilt transaxle into my 69 bus. It is going very
smoothly. I have one concern . When i disconnected the CV joints from the
old transaxle I noticed that one side (right) has a thin dished kind of a
washer that is equal in diameter to the CV joint itself. It seems like
this thing holds all of the grease into the CVjoint. The other side is
missing this thing. The one that is on there is kind of dented. I'd like
to replace them both and repack the CVjoint with grease while it's apart
but i dont know what it's called .

Equal in diameter to the CV?  I don't know about that, but there is a
dished washer that goes between the CV and the shaft.  That one is easy,
leave it out!  According to Bentley, anyway!
