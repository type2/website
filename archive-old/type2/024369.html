&gt; 
&gt; Also, while my &quot;Olympus&quot; stove says *not* to use
&gt; American unleaded, my &quot;Coleman&quot; says it's *okay* to
&gt; use it, but it's not preferred. I find this confusing,
&gt; as they are essentially the same type of stove, just
&gt; that one is (much) smaller. 

 They're covering themselves: The camping fuel is pretty much 
pure petrol, whereas the stuff you put in your car is full of
additives: They don't know what the effect of breathing the
byproducts will be, because they can't know what's in there,
so they advise against its use.
 In Europe camping gas is most widely used (butane, propane 
or a mix) and you have to hunt for &quot;white gas&quot;. Paraffin
(kerosene) is widely available in the UK, I don't know about
on the continent.
 For the backpacker, camping gas or paraffin are probably the
obvious choices. For the VW folks, &quot;camping gas&quot; (the butane
based gases) are the obvious choice (though there may be
issue with refilling/exchanging gas bottles in some countries).

 The advantage of a petrol stove is obviously that you only 
need one fuel (and can get it anywhere you can drive).
 From what's being said about the Coleman units, I think they
must be different from the ones I've seen. The comments I 
made about safety are more appropriate for the single-burner
backpacking stoves, which are designed for use in open 
spaces.
