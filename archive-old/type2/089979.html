Subject: Re: [T2] Keeping a bus from being stolen

&lt;&lt; Also a kill switch that will do something like shut off power to my 
distributor or something like that.  That would hide back in the closet, and 
I would only use it if I was parking my bus somewhere for a while, or 
somewhere I didn't trust.

Any ideas, suggestions or criticisms?  I love my bus but I know old VWs get 
stolen a bit since they're easy to steal and a source of free parts.

Cheep kill switch from from my childhood friend's older brother who used it 
to keep
us from using his car...Pop the dizzy and pocket the rotor. Just remember to 
re-
place it when YOU wanna drive away...:-(
