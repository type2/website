Subject: Re: (friday) the truth about our VW's

Wade-
         ...On the other hand, maybe &quot;they&quot; didn't  give those 60's VW's 
those tests. &quot;Hey, slow down, that's a speed bump...Ouch.&quot; Since paint was 
the only rust prevention,
I doubt if &quot;they&quot; used any high pressure water. Most vehicles from that time 
period were built the same way. Galvanizing is a later feature in auto 
production. Under car
rust prevention was mostly after market add ons...undercoating, etc. which 
leads to
its own evils. There wasn't much to haggle about in VW dealerships, customers 
pretty
much knew what they wanted. Options would have been the only thing to 
discuss, since
prices were set.
