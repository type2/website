Subject: Re; Timing setting

I have a similar setup 1600 twin port, 009 dissie, and Pertronix Igniter and 
do not experience hanging.

As this is just a points replacement there should be no power difference at all.
Didn't notice any diference in MPG either.

However I did notice when fitting the Pertronix that the dwell was more than 
the manuals suggested and was not adjustable by changing the gap.

I may be barking up the wrong tree (or just barking mad) but this may upset
your static timing. I would suggest setting the timing dynamicaly as per
the Bently or Haynes manuals.

In the case of difference of opinions I trust Bently first, then Haynes and
Muir last - that doesn't mean that Muir is rubbish!
