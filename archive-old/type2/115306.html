Subject: re: Vacuum hoses NLA

Large heat-shring  hoses ARE available.  But could they be used to repair 
existing NLA vacuum hoses ? ? ?

Or the 2&quot;-&gt; .75&quot; diameter for 2X48&quot; for $87.25 tubing??

or the 1&quot; -&gt; .5&quot;  diameter for 5x6&quot; for $4.35!!

Heck, you don't even need much more than 4 x 2&quot; pieces for the four ends of 
the two hoses in question.  Heat shrink those ends  and they are going to 
stay...
