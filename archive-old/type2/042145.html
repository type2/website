Thanks,

I don't know if you guys have heard the speak about Part Place, but some posts
on the Vanagon site and the fine print in their new catalog concerns me.
Basically, the terms New and Rebuilt have been misunderstood between Parts Place
and a few customers.  The final solution was that the credit card company
returned the customers money to him, not sure what happened to Parts Place.  I
do know that their new deal on engines is for CASH only, its about $600 more if
you use a credit card or want a warrantee.  My take on this is that they have
had SEVERAL returns and the credit card company stood behind the consumer, not
the vendor and Parts Place got burnt.

I regularly buy from Parts Place, especially since they have alot of diesel
parts, and have had only good experiences, except for the time I tried to
clarify remanufactured on an axle, and learned that it could mean used with new
grease and in good condition or the more traditional meaning of new joints, used
shaft.  They couldn't tell me which, however.  I would recommend them, and may
buy an engine off of them, but not without alot of research on such a big item.

&gt; eek! $3200??
&gt;
&gt; Check with Parts Place, Auburn Hills, MI.  1 248 373-2300.  Their latest
&gt; catalog advertises new 1.9 liter TD longblocks that come from Canada for
&gt; $1700.  Its a special price on a specific lot of engines.  It might be worth
&gt; checking, depending on your sources for all the peripherals.
