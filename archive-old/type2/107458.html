Subject: Re: [T2] Spark Plugs Bosch vs NGK

You talked me into it! If Bosch doesn't want my business, I am flexible.  My
bus has been experiencing a bit of a flat spot with my Bosch plugs, so I
just went out and bought new NGK plugs, the ones they say are correct for my
VW on their website (B6HS). Only problem I had was, when I went to screw
those little threaded caps off, one of the studs started threading right out
of the plug body. I ended up having to clamp the little stud carefully in my
vice to get the cap off. I'll let you know how my bus runs with the NGK's.
So far so good.

 Subject: RE: [T2] Spark Plugs Bosch vs NGK


  When I was at the SEMA show and talked to a BOSCH engineer I was amazzed
that he said NOT to RUN any BOSCH plug in an air cooled engine unless it was
new. He said that BOSCH plugs (standerd style) have a higher tendency to
foul then other brands and also said ABSOLUTLEY do not use Platinum plugs in
an air cooled engine.
  I guess that is why all new VW air cooled engines from MEXICO come with
NGK plugs and the BOSCH factory is with in spitting distance of the VW
engine plant!
