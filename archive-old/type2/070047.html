I'm on the verge of buying a 71 type II with the camper package, lacking 
only the fridge/stove box, as near as I can tell.  I'm just looking for a 
little second opinion on this one.  I've had 4 or 5 bugs over the years, 
but never a bus, and don't feel quite as confident in looking for the 
right issues.  California body, very clean, rebuilt motor by a reputable 
local outfit, new distributor and a few other less important engine 
parts.  Canvas on the pop top is pretty good, considering the age, but 
the screen is shot.  Electrics are good, though the turnsignal lever is a 
cobbled on aftermarket and one of the rear running lights is just plain 
missing.  The heater boxes look intact, but the cables are shot.  All the 
glass is good, but the gaskets are very hard and cracked, original I'm 
sure.  The pop top gasket is history.  Interior upholstery is very good, 
all things considered.  The dash is bad news.  Brakes are cheesy, tires a 
little better than fair.  Wheel bearings feel tight, but I don't really 
trust my hands very far on that.  Mostly a good running engine and a much 
better that average body.  Asking $2500, probably take less.  What do you 
think?  Feel free to send this to a better place if you know one.  
Thanks.
