&gt; &gt; Hi All - Solve my mystery
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I've never written before, here is my problem.  I completely rebuilt my '79 2.0 with Hydraulic lifters last summer.  I drove it for 2000 successful miles and then it started acting funny after about 50 miles on a road trip.  It was losing power and then coming to life again, after it did this a few times I pulled off the freeway and noticed smoke behind me.
&gt; &gt; Now the engine runs well (I havn't tried more than 10 miles or so) but the noise is really loud.  It does it when first starting out until a higher rpms when i'm sure it disappears because it is too rapid.  It has rhythm, sounds like a horribly bad lifter (so I replaced them!) and sounds like it is coming from deep inside the crankcase.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Before the car started losing power on the freeway the was a knocking (predetonation, valves?) noise that got louder and louder - then the power loss.  The new noise sounds much louder and deeper than the old noise.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Here is what was done to the engine for the rebuild -
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; - Standard bearings - the crank and case were fine (says the machine shop)
&gt; &gt; - Used cam - my downfall???
&gt; &gt; - rebuilt heads w/ new exhaust valves
&gt; &gt; - brand new pistons and cylinders
&gt; &gt; - new cam bearings
&gt; &gt; - rebuilt rods
&gt; &gt; - cleaned out oil cooler
&gt; &gt; - all new gaskets of course!
&gt; &gt; - everything was steam cleaned and the tin was glass beaded and looks beautiful
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I really don't want to send this car on its way, and I don't want to put another engine in it (I already spent $1200 on it)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The only shop I've taken it to says the cam gear may be loosening up at the rivets - but that the noise is definitely inside the crank case.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; SOLVE MY MYSTERY!!!
&gt; &gt;
Eric:
 Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but it sounds like severe
mechanical  trauma inside your engine. Once you've assured yourself that
it's not valve gear related it's time to pull the motor. Don't despair,
not everything spent on the rebuild is wasted! The heads should be okay,
unless you've dropped a valve seat.
 My guesses are:
 1. Rod bearing. Cause- Debris in oil passages from inadequate cleaning
 during rebuild.
 2. Loose flywheel. Cause- Improper installation of shims or torque of
 bolts
 3. Melted pistons. Cause- Too high compression ratio, too much
lead(btdc) in timing, too lean mix caused by bad temp sensor in air flow
meter.
 Anyway it's probably something you did or didn't do, new motors don't
 fail after 2000 miles. You'll be surprised at how much faster you can
 assemble it the SECOND time! There's a learning curve here.
 Let us know what you find. It's well worth redoing- a late 2.0 fi loaf
 is a truely sweet thing when it's 100%, you can't go to the dealer and
 buy a new one! (even for $10,500)
 Good luck,
