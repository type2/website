&gt; &gt; But some aftermarket carbs
&gt; &gt; use the 1/4in or 5/16in fuel line and it will be

&gt; &gt; there. 
&gt; 
&gt; Still a bad idea, IMHO, as the fitting on your stock
&gt; fuel pump is still metric. What happens when you try
&gt; to clamp a larger diameter hose on a smaller fitting,
&gt; is actually creating a gap in the hose (where the
&gt; excess material is scrunched together)...this will
&gt; eventually allow *some* fuel to penetrate. Not much;
&gt; you might not even notice it...but eventualy, the line
&gt; will come loose. Not good. Especially for us upright
&gt; owners, where the fuel pump is located next to that
&gt; sparky little thing called a dizzy;-)
&gt; 
&gt; It's far better to stretch the proper diameter hose
&gt; over the larger fittings, than to risk a fire.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; When I first bought my '69 Westy, a VW mechanic friend
&gt; immediately noticed the new, but non-stock fuel line.
&gt; Without saying a word, he went in his shop, came back
&gt; with the proper hose and replaced it. He charged me
&gt; for the hose, and said, 'Trust me, you'll thank me
&gt; later'.

I was thinking about this and pulled out the calculator.  A 1/4 inch hose
as an ID of 0.250 in.  6mm converts to an ID of 0.236 inch.  The
difference is .014 inch.

I've seen a greater variation than this in the fuel inlets/outlets on
various lines, pumps, and carburators on VWs.  The metric hose fits a tiny
bit tighter, but one should still be careful of the fit, regardless of the
hose used.  If the hose is a good friction fit it will make a good seal.
If it slides on with little effort, the seal won't be all that good, even
with clamps.
