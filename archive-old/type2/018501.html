&gt;$400 per person per visit customs limit

That's for stuff accompanying you back into the country, Bill.  I doubt
that it applies to mail order, whereby you could conceivably place
multiple orders, each $400 or less, but totalling considerably more.

At the suggestion of Dave Russell, I took a look at the U.S. Postal
Service site, rather than U.S. Customs.  It says:

&quot;All mail originating in foreign countries and U.S. overseas
territories, other than the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, is subject to
U.S. Customs examination upon entering the United States. [...] When
dutiable merchandise enters the United States by mail, the amount due is
determined by the Customs Service, but is collected by the Postal
Service.  When the duty is collected on behalf of the Customs Service,
the Postal Service also collects a customs clearance and delivery fee on
each dutiable item.  This fee offsets the cost of collection and
remittance.&quot;

Beyond that, they refer you to the U.S. Customs Service.

Together with Brian Hayes' feedback, it seems that mail-ordering from a
vendor outside of the U.S. boils down to a crap-shoot - you won't know
what it's going to cost, if anything, until the stuff shows up at your
door.

Also consistent with Brian's observation about spot checking is the
Postal Service's verbiage: &quot;is subject to U.S. Customs examination&quot;. 
That's not the same as if they said it WILL be examined.

As Bob Perring put it, &quot;I've paid good taxes for that fog!&quot;.
