Subject: Re: [T2] Was Hard to Crank. Now FLOATING TIMING

Uhm, yeah. I'm being stupid again today. I forgot to factor in RPM. I think
the drift was probably just my engine warming up, and RPM's changing becouse
of it. I'll go do my timing RIGHT this time, and write back if it's still
messed up. I would still like to know how to adjust fuel mixture if it's
possible on a FI though. I mean if it's possible without special gauges or
anything.

Chris

&gt; Weights seem to be ok. Nothing looks amiss. Anything else that would cause
&gt; floating timing? Would a simple vacuum leak do that? I can't find any
leaks,
&gt; but c'mon, I'm bound to have at least one! :)
&gt;
&gt; Oh yeah, how do you tell if your running rich or lean without special
&gt; instruments on a fuel injected bus? Or don't you?
