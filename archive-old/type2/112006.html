&gt; Sorry about my last vague posting. I am doing some professional continueing

So, exactly how do you put out a flaming Marine?  :)

&gt; While troubleshooting my odd steering behavior, I slid under my bus and had
&gt; my wife turn the steering wheel. The problem was as frightening as it was
&gt; obvious: The housing that the relay arm rotates through has twisted away
&gt; from the front axle. Ahhhhrgg.

&gt; What now? Is there any possible way to repair this, or does one need to
&gt; replace the axle? How much of a PITA is it to replace the axle? Anybody want
&gt; two (count 'em!) busses in Vancouver, BC?

Yow!  Not a good situation!  Sounds like your axle is rusted out.  Best
fix is to obtain an axle from the arid Southwest.  Second best is to weld
up your existing axle, _but_ make darned sure that the corrosion is only
local to the pivot.  If the tubes are rusty inside, they are toast!  The
vastly preferable fix is to replace the whole axle.

The axle is replacable by normal humans, but set aside a weekend for it.
