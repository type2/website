Subject: Sportsmobile

&gt;Does anybody out there have any info or lit. about sportmobiles?

I believe the Sportsmobiles were conversions were done in the USA. Elkhart
Indiana to be exact. I've seen literature laying around at shows. I had a 69
Sportsmobile as a parts bus for a couple of years. Ended up giving it to a
guy from Carbondale IL. He was going to use it for a parts bus till he
decided it looked better than the one he was restoring. Last I heard it was
happily driving around in Illinois.
