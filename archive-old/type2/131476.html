Subject: RE: failure notice

From: Michael Knight

&gt;What I am saying is that. If the air entering the heat exchangers is closed 
&gt;off, you close them by dashboard lever, then the air that was flowing 
&gt;through there is now added to the stream of air that is flowing over the 
&gt;engine. If the covers/coffers(=D) are not there, when you close off the HEs 
&gt;then the air that would be added is lost by way of open air where covers 
&gt;should be. Or is there sometype of release at the front of the HEs when 
&gt;they are closed off?




    From: &quot;Karl&quot;

When the flapper valves are turned off, ALL the heat that goes thru the 
heater boxes vent out the flapper valves....right at the 
transaxle/starter/axle area. TOO much heat!  In late 77, for the 78 and up 
models, VW made different valves. The new style has the exhaust heat exiting 
a hose and then going out pipes to the rear on each side. Go here and look 
at the valves. The ones with a mushroom head dump right there.

#12 are 72 to 77.
Now look at #11A, 39, and 41. These are the 78/79 set-ups. The 41 pipe runs 
down the outside of each frame rail. The rear support bracket bolts to the 
rear hanger front frame bolt.
I have left and right of #26.......


Damb Karl where have you been all my life? That is the answer I was looking 
for, the picture I needed and you have them, too. Unreal! I love it. Is #28 
on that page a cover for a different year or is it something else?

I need them just tell me how much.

Thanks,
