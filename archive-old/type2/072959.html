Subject: child's cot brackets

Could someone give me the measurements for installing the child's cot
brackets in the A &amp; B pillars? Scott was nice enough to include one in the
interior he sold me, and I'd like install it in Wendelin for 9-y/o Lauren
for when we go camping (and temporary storage when she outgrows it).

BTW, Wendelin should be home in a week or so. The head is on its way back
to AVP and they've told me it's a one-day turnaround. I've been getting
pretty good response in the past couple of weeks, I'm really sittin' on
'em. Hope to have the ol' girl back on the road shortly.

Nikki
