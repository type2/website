&lt;&lt; When I was growing up in West Texas, propane was &quot;free&quot; at the well sites 
and my stepdad modified his car to run on it(with a carb).  Wasn't old 
enough to know whether it ran better or worse, only that the fuel was 
pretty much free....the only bad part was when he almost froze his hand 
off filling it up one day when he didn't get the connector on the tank 
good.

One of the good parts of running on propane...Ever see the cumbustion
chambers of a propane-fuelie...Looks good as new thousands of miles
later...And you can bump the CR up... 8-)
