Subject: Re: [T2] carb

&gt;I'm looking for a Weber 32/36 DFEV kit for my 2.0 Type IVthat I use as a 
&gt;daily driver.

My 2.0 engine ran excellently for a long time with a 009 and
this DFEV.  I never drove a better bus, and that included
several FI and dual carb busses.  It did run rich though,
as I discovered just before I started an overhaul (for fun
and adventure).

The manifold on many of these kits (all that I have seen)
look extremely cheap--maybe this doesnt actually matter
for anything, but it sure doesnt make you feel good
buying one.
