Subject: Ras Bulli Split or the energiser bunny?

Six hundred miles since Ras Bulli Split pulled back onto the road.
Today's venture was out to a place called Napadogon on old highway 107
which skirts across the bottom of Merimachi country then over to the
Maine border...but we were not going that far...thankfully.  Over 90%
of the traffic on this road is comprised of tandem and triple rigs
hauling pulp to the mill in Nackawick or further on to Edmunston...and
the road has the crowns to prove it...patched so many times that the
original asphalt is indiscernible.  And here was this little '66 Bus
trying to straddle the 15&quot; mound in the centre of the west-bound lane
while running broadside to a series of 25 knot gusts...and it's not
like I can jenny the main.  Luckily, today is Sunday and we do not
have to share this narrow ribbon with the larger 100'+ rigs that would
sailing around as much as we...and they always win ;)

Finally we arrived at Mike Visseurs house, across the highway from the
pulp loading yard and straight up [or at least the bus thought so].
Parked partway up the grade are two '65s, a kombi and a panel that had
been home-converted into a camper at least once during it's life.
These were the reasons for our trip.  I parked Ras Bulli at the summit
of the driveway and jumped out, gave the obligatory pet to the dog,
still having my arm, knocked on the back door.

Mike is an interesting fellow and has no less than six buses sitting
in the yard --only the two splits and the rest are breadloaves-- and a
whole shed full of parts...though somewhat disorganised.  After
chatting for a few minutes he pointed me a the converted panel and
said I could grab what I need [he is turning it into a playhouse for
the kids as the frame is shot].  For a bus that looked so bad on the
outside, the interior was in excellent shape...within minutes I had a
proper oil-bath air-cleaner [good-bye to the Beetle filter], two
rather new looking interior lights, sunvisors, a new ignition switch, a
few assorted dash lights and knobs, and a windshield washer bottle and
pump [though the pump is rather deteriorated].  I lugged all this loot
back up to the door step and laid it out for my host to
appraise....$15.  &quot;For the air-cleaner?&quot;, I asked.  &quot;Naw, $15 for all
of it&quot; ... I gave him $20 dollars [he wouldn't take more].  He then
apologised for not being able to find the hinges for the rear-apron
[one of mine is broken and the other is held together with a nail] and
promised to drop them off at the house when he was in town next week

We chatted a bit more as I loaded the stuff in to the bus.  He invited
me to come back anytime I need anything.  I thanked him and promised
to bring the big bar and 46mm socket the next time and we would get
the axle nuts off the other '65 he is working on.  Liz and I slid back
down the gravel driveway, sheeted in a new tack and sailed for home.

This evening, I changed the tumbler from my burnt ignition core into
the one I pulled...finally I can get rid of the push-button start
[though I am getting use to it ;)].  I cleaned the oil cleaner and
elbows in the kitchen sink [Liz was out...and not impressed when she
returned] and dried the parts in the oven [save the &quot;horsehair?&quot;
filter...how do you clean this anyway?].  Instead of the usual rubber
sleeve from the cleaner to the carb, someone had fitted this cleaner
with a length of heavy gauge stainless flex-hose [this must have been
quite sometime ago and would have even cost more than a penny then]
that will prolly outlast the bus.  I installed the sleeve and cleaner
mount in the bus...filled the cleaner to the mark with 20 weight oil
[as per the Bentley], and snapped it into position.  I then sat back
and watched as oil ran out into the engine compartment...Hmmm...maybe
I got the wrong mark.  

I took it back down and there was half the oil as I had put into the
pan...I then noticed that the bottom was slightly convex when viewed
from the inside.  I determined that this may be a feature of age
rather than the original shape.  I cleaned up my mess, put less oil
back into the pan and snapped it back together.  I attached the hose
to the little tube by the oil-fill and found a length of paper hose to
run for the preheat.  I then started the bus and to my amazement she
was ready about the time my pipe was lit.._dot_definite improvement on the
warming up factor.

Tomorrow, Liz is going to dismantle the sunvisors [one of them has a
broken wire inside and is fairly &quot;pillow-like&quot; in shape].  She is also
going to make new cloth covers for them as the white vinyl is beyond
salvage [not even the lighter-fluid trick could clean them].

After work tomorrow, I will install the old-new ignition and fix my
driver's door lock [I had enough pins left over to repair the damage
some kids did with a screwdriver].  We will be travelling in style on
Friday when we leave for MTL.

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Splits...Oh, my!

Roy
