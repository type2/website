Subject: Analog Clock Fixable?

When I bought my bus, there was a hole in the dash and I found a clock in the cupboard under the sink. I can only assume that the clock doesn't work. However, I have no idea how to go about reattaching it. Does anyone out there know which of the many spare wires under my dash could be responsible? Does VDO make a nice after-market alternative? Has anyone ever successfully fixed a broken original clock?

Thanks everyone.
