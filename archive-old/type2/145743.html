Subject: westy light

Well, I went to Camping World and bought two 8W bulbs for about 12  bucks.  On the underside of the light socket it says 12V,  8W.  So I figure it will work.  While there, I noticed that  three white colored wires were not connected to anything.  I could  see that they connected to the circuit board and the grooves they had  made let me know that they went on in order.  But when I hooked it  up (it had the hot wire to the outside of the bus, ground wire to the  inside), I got a little smoke and never any light.  I'm suspecting  my old bulb is still good but it wouldn't work either.
  
  The bulb I bought is a Thin-Lite F8T5/CW.  The guy assured me it would work, FWTW.  
  
  Where did I go wrong?  Anybody have a schematic of that  light.  Or a replacement they'll sell me?  I want this light  to work!  Thanks....KR
