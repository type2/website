Subject: RE: clutch noise, rear brakes, tires

&gt; From: David Preston &lt;prest010_at_gold.tc.umn_dot_edu&gt;
&gt; Subject: Clutch still rumbles
&gt; As I reported earlier when I push the
&gt; clutch in I hear a deep rumble.  Suspected the throw out. -- Replaced it
&gt; -- still rumbles. 
	[]  
	Volks:Two problems I'd like comments, info on:

	Unlike Dave, I have the opposite problem. When sitting still in
nuetral, I hear a pum....pum....pum
	noise that I thought was the beginning of an exhaust leak. The
repetition rate matches engine speed.
	Then I notice when I put in the clutch the noise goes away?????

	Second, my left back brake seeme to be sticking on sometmes when I
stop. If I stop gently, or 
	release the brakes when I am still moving, no problem. If I have the
brakes applied when the van stops, 
	when I pull away, sometimes the right  rear squats a bit, and it
takes more than normal throttle/clutch 
	to pull away. It seems to let go again once I get moving but
sometimes it makes a sort of howl sound for the first ten feet or so. Note
also if I backup a bit before pulling away, they aren't stuck.
	I assume its is worn shoes, or a spring or something, however I just
had new tires put on, and am wondering
	if tightening the wheels tootight can cause this? A friends beetle
once failed a safety test because the
	guy that checke d the brakes the day before tightened the wheels too
tight, and the brakes locked up in teh brake test. Once we loosened the nuts
a bit it was fine, but by then it had no lisence plates
	I intend to look at the back brakes. Does the drum come off
separately, or do I need to remove the wheel 
	bearings, adn hence need a big socket, and long bar?

	Third: I just boought Michelin MX reinforced 185SR14 tires. They
seem a bit wobbly, but this may be 
	because the 22yr old Michelin 185SR14XZ's that were on it had turned
to stone. While talking to 
	Continental, the fellow told me their CR21 tire was specifically
made for VW buses,and Westies?


	Thanks for any help. BIll Crick
