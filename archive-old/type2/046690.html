Subject: Re: [T2] Low oil pressure at low speeds

Hi Joe,

Disclaimer: This is not my recommendation for a permanent fix.  This is the
bailing wire fix Joe asks for.

First:  Install a set of high performance oil system pistons and springs with
30 wt oil.

Second:  Switch to 40 wt oil and let it warm up a bit.  (Use a block heater?)

Third:  Try the high volume oil pump.

Drive very carefully and easily, staying close to home while you build a
replacement engine.

&gt; Carb was dumping gas into engine
&gt;
&gt; bearings are now loose enough to reduce oil pressure.
&gt;
&gt; I'm wondering if a &quot;heavy duty&quot; oil pump might keep me from having to
&gt; tear down the engine.  It's not my dailiy driver -- I'd like to keep it
&gt; runnable for once or twice a week pleasure trips around town.
&gt;
&gt; Any suggestions on further diagnostics or baling-wire solutions
&gt; appreciated!
