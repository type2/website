Subject: Re: [T2] Diagnostic Expertise Needed - mystery solved!

Sounds like you are on the right track. AMC heads are known for
worthless hardware installed, but they ought to get you through your
trip, and then you can have them reworked as you planned. The only
difficulty I had in reinstalling a head was getting a good angle for
the torque wrench, but then I was using a beam type. A clicker would
have been nice here.

&gt; As an aside - gowesty recommend re-machining the AMC
 heads and fitting better valves even when new (as a
 couple of list members had already suggested), but my
 vacation time constraints precluded this option. I'm
 thinking I might drop the engine in a month or two,
 and at that time buy another new AMC, get both of them
 machined together, and do the job properly

&gt; In case anyone else is planning anything similar, I
 can verify that getting the right-hand head off
 without dropping the engine is a piece of cake - took
 me 2-3 hours, working slowly. I hope the reverse is
 true...
