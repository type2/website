Subject: Re: [T2] Thermostat- to fit or not to fit?


&gt;They advised that if the flaps stick closed which they have a tendency to 
&gt;do, then the engine will overheat and this is not covered on my engine 
&gt;warranty.

An engine without flaps will never warm up and will ruin itself before it's 
due time - dies an early death. However I can assure you that it will be 
after their warranty runs out. Put those flaps in - I HAVE NEVER had flaps 
stick shut. All major name aircooled engines are equipped with thermostats 
designed to fail with the flaps OPEN.

Install a cylinder head temp gauge and/or an overtemp light. You'll know 
when the flaps fail (NEVER).

You'll also want that engine to warm up enough to warm up your toes!!!

&gt;My concern is that if I do not fit the thermostat then the engine will never
&gt;warm up the petrol will not burn correctly and both the performance and the
&gt;life of the engine (due to increased wear while running cold) will be
&gt;effected.  I live in the UK and as such we get some cold winters.  If I
&gt;lived in sunnier climes I may not worry as much.
&gt;
&gt;I called VEGE who advised me to fit the thermostat for all of the above
&gt;reasons and that if I check the stat and that the flaps are clean and not
&gt;covered in dirt and grime from the roads then they should always work and
&gt;not cause any great problems.  The cynic in me says that VEGE would tell me
&gt;this as they know they will have to cover me on the warranty if the engine
&gt;wears quickly but that if I fit the thermostat like they say and it
&gt;overheats they will not have to cover me.
