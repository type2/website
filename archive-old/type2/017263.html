&gt; &gt;My wild guess is that the 4500rpm limiter rotor is for type 1 engines and

&gt; I missed the origional bit but if we are talking of the neat centrifugal
&gt; limiting rotors they are in fact available in a smear of ranges from
&gt; 3500-5500 or so in 500 rpm increments.  Gene Berg used to carry them,
&gt; probably still does, and I notice Automotion lists one for the 914 but fails
&gt; to mention it's rpm.  All around $30 US as I recall.  Or put in a MSD 6AL
&gt; and get rev limiting as a byproduct.  Which brings on a question would it be
&gt; damaging in any way to use one of the rotors with a regular non limiting
&gt; electronic or CD ignition of some sort, damaging to the ignition that is,
&gt; say an MSD 6A or the stock CA Vanagon or whatever, the sort of ignition that
&gt; carries warnings about not pulling plugs without grounding them.

John:
Those rotors ground the coil output to the dist. shaft so they should
work okay.
Also, 911 porsches used similar rotors with higher cut-out points,
65-7500rpm range, and it seems to me that they will interchange.
Might be useful for a hotrodded motor, would be wasted on a stocker.
