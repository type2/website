Subject: Heater tube OVER beam?

List,
Couldn't find a direct reference to this in the archives or library, so...

I ripped most of the heater tube out from under the bus (74 kombi)the other
day. WEAR SAFETY GLASSES! *blink, blink*

It was wrapped in what appeared to be a stock vinyl-on-the-outside, fuzzy
stuff-on-the-inside, rather dense and tough zipped at the seam insualtion
-which is kinda neat and i may reuse. Anybody else have this stuff on their
bus?

Anyway, the main question is about the part of the tube that goes up and OVER
the front beam - thats right -between the beam and the floor pan. It is
manufactured to do this (stamped and spotwelded at the seams) and is about an
inch or less tall where it passes over the beam.  Seems to me it would
'venturi' or restrict any air that might just happen to make it that far up
the tube...

I will be replacing the whole tube (barring the flapper box in the middle and
the 'header' in the back) with insulated (i'll do that) 4&quot; flexible exhaust
pipe.

The front over-the-beam pipe is in the best shape of any of it - still got the
paint on it - very little rust, but i wanna hack it out and run the 4&quot; stuff
right through the torsion tubes because i think it will flow better.

Any thoughts?

TIA,
Clark
