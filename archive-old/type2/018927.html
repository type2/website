=================================
Hi!

I own a VW Bus Kombi (model 1974).  May I
seek your kind advice on how I may
improve my diesel-converted bus.  The original
owners of this kombi used an
Izuzu Gemina 4BF1 model - and the result is an
overheater very week motor, especially in my high
altitude (7000 feet asl) and mountainous region
- Baguio City Philippines.

I intend to replace the engine to a Toyota TC
Turbo model -very popular (powerful and affordable)
among local owners in our country.

 But I'm can't figure out
how to make the engine match the differential/wheels.
May I seek your advice here?

THANK YOU SO MUCH!!1
