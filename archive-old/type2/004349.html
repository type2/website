X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL - A

I guess I've been watching too many episodes of Junk Yard Wars lately.
Stopped by Interstate VW in Lakeside San Diego today, and brought  back
three dog house fan shrouds +ACo-two  of them complete with control flaps+ACo- , a
Westfalia Werke G-K fold down rear seat/bed that will replace my rear full
length stationary seat.
+ACo-still have the 3/4 length  middle seat in excellent condition if anyone is
interested, and it's black+ACo-..   Can I just remove, then plug the rear heater
outlets with something non flammable, and then just bolt the seat/bed in or
is their a better way?

I'll be heading for Phoenix +ACo-104 degrees in the shade +ACo- in the next couple
of days to visit my daughter, and Grandson.  Looking forward to using the
fold down bed in what was once the original SUV soon to be a camper van.
