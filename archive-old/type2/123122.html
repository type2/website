&gt; &gt;Also, I am ashamed to say that I made it only about 10 miles on a recycle
&gt; &gt;run with rebuilt 041 heads and Dellorto DRLA 36's on an 1835cc.  I limped
&gt; &gt;home and now a few days later, looked under my valve covers.  There appears
&gt; &gt;to be something holding #2 exhaust valve open approx. 4 mm.  either that or
&gt; &gt;it is seized in its guide, or something else horrific has happened.  Might
&gt; &gt;have sucked in a piece of debris or (gasp!) a loose nut or something?!?
&gt; (yes
&gt; &gt;I have air filters on there) Would anyone admit to having this happen
&gt; &gt;before?

unfortunatel twice about 20 years apart, 

my very first rebuild on a 65 Westy didn't get the end play right, engine
went about 200ft and sieze irrevocably....total destruction...van never
ran again.

current engine when rebuilt started it up and immediately shut it down,
sounded like it was going to explode.  turns out somehow one of those
sheet metal washers got into an intake runner, pulled the head, removed
the remains of the washer, thank goodness it was soft alum and not steel.
checked the piston and head very closely for damage and other than some
marks on the piston top all was well, put engine back together and it is
still running in my van about 30K later.
