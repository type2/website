Subject: Downshifting

I almost always downshift with double clutching, but that is more just old
habit, and looking at the 
cost of brakes vs clutches, it probably doesn't make sense.
However when I learned to drive you had to do this for trucks, and tractors
etc, and my father
used to joke that it was a good idea in a sports car because the teeth in
the transmission 
were so small you had to do it in order to stir up the oil;-) 
I'd also have to say that I've worn the valve train out of a few old
Datsuns, and the hig reving 
engine braking may have had something to do with it. On  the other hand,
reving the
hell out of it all the time to keep it in the real power band may have had
something to do with it;-)
