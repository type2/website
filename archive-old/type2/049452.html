Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Drum Puller...

I've used my puller setup once in 15 years, but I've never seen a puller bend
the center of a drum. I'd be god-awful impressed if it did happen, especially on
a bus that had been recently driven, since the forces of the drum's rotation
would tend to keep it from rusting on too solidly. Not that it couldn't happen,
but I've never seen it.

&gt; center of the drum is stamped steel, it is rusted to the hub, you can pull
&gt; hard enough with a puller to bent the center of the drum. It will be a paper
&gt; weight after that. When useing the hammer, you must hit it at the hub, knock
&gt; the studs out first if needed so you do not destroy them.
