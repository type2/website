&gt; There is always the Corvair engine too. $200 with $1500 rebuilds. Good 150K
&gt; mile motor so it is durable.

Good point.

&gt; Since the engine is going on a watercraft - why not use a watercooled
&gt; engine like a Subbieroo?

Or any other auto engine!

The reason is probably weight and tradition.  Orginally airboats were
powered with war surplus aircraft engines that were available cheap.  then
they went to &quot;runout&quot; aircraft engines that were not airworthy because of
being over their TBO time.  These days, even the &quot;runout&quot; engines are
pricey.  The closest cheap engine to the aircraft engine is the VW.

Now you got me thinking about a Corvair for my bus again...
