Subject: Re: [T2] Any thoughts? my engine is running rough

Hello,

As far as the idle goes, I hooked up my tach and it
said that it was running 2000 rpms. It sounded more
like 1100 or so rpms and was missing badly. This was
before I realized that i was running on 2 cylinders.
Actually, I believe this engine has solid lifters. I
thought that it came stock with hydraulic lifters but
it has solid lifters now.

I am going to go back out tonight and do a few things
to the engine. I have thought of a few common sense
things to try to fix the problem. Sometimes it just
takes standing back and looking at something from a
different angle.

I will keep the list posted on any changes. Thanks for
the help!

Regards,

David Kelly

&gt; &gt; Hello list,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have been having trouble getting the vacuum up
&gt; in my
&gt; &gt; bus. My bus has a 2L f.i. engine. I only have 7in
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; vacuum at idle. 
&gt; 
&gt; What is the idle rpm?
&gt; 
&gt; Hydraulic lifters?
&gt;
