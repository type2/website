did you check the dwell of the points? sudden poor performance
sometimes comes from bad points.
 
&gt; All vacuum attached.................oil level about 2&quot; high, so i suspect
&gt; leaky or constant injector.  I unplugged cold start valve and same symptoms.

did the oil have any gas smell? 

&gt; Distributor did not come loose, either.

but if the points changed in any way the timing would have changed.
