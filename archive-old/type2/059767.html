Subject: dizzy questions....

Greetings all...

Just got off the phone with my mechanic who's trying to do some
troubleshooting on my 71 bus.  

He mentioned that my distributor jumps around a lot and is not advancing
very far.  Anyone know what the causes for this might be?  It's a dual
vacuum advance dizzy with new cap, rotor, and condensor.

I've been having a lot of problems with power at lower rpms and I wonder
if this is related (probably so).

Any thoughts/ideas/suggestions that I can take to the table?

Thanks.
