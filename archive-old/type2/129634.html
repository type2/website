Subject: throttle cable question

Can anyone tell me the location of the throttle cable on a 73 Westy? Currently
the throttle cable enters the engine compartment from the right side of the
transmission. This would be the right side when looking at the engine from the
back of the bus. This worked fine when the weber was in the bus, but now I am
switching over to duals and the relay shaft needs to have the cable on the
left side of the transmission. Is this the correct relay shaft for this year
bus? Do I just need to move the cable over to the left side of the engine?
What problems will run into with moving this cable to this side of the
engine?

Thanks,
Corbett
