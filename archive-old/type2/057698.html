&gt;As I continue to get my carbs balanced and working properly, I keep running
&gt;accross things that are missing.  The latest is a thermostatic valve that
&gt;regulates the injection quantity of the accelerator pump.  This valve is
&gt;only installed on 1974 automatic transmissions.  Sooo, my question is; is
&gt;this a vital component on my carb?  Will this affect any performance of the
&gt;engine?

No, and not really.  I've never even seen one of those things.
