&gt; I've been considering getting the CDs. My problem is that have Sparcs
&gt; running Solaris and Macs running OS X. Is there a chance in heck that
&gt; I'd be able to look at the CD with either? There's a windows emulator
&gt; that runs on OS X, and that could be used if necessary.

The eBahn viewer software is basically an Acrobat plugin running in a
neutered web browser but all file access is through a local cgi service. I
didn't like it that much. I've never tried using Virtual PC to run it but I
suppose it's possible and probably slow.

&gt; I don't suppose the CD is just a bunch of .pdfs with some proprietary
&gt; indexing/access software is it?

The data is stored in PDFs but they are further encoded into a format that
eBahn reads to keep you from stealing the content. The files are
sequentially numbered. With a lot of work it's possible to create for
yourself a CD of just PDFs that you can read using any PDF viewer and leave
eBahn in the dust.
