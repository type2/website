     I well recall one day laying under a Subaru with a gas welding
torch, welding on the frame, and hearing this strange noise, sounded
like boiling water. Couldn't figure out what it was, so I shut off the
torch for a minute, the sound continued. 
     Then I realized that the gas tank was right behind what I was
welding, and what I heard boiling was gasoline. You can guess how fast I
scooted out from under that car, eh? 
     Later on I got the job done, just stuck a shovel in between to
deflect the flame/heat from the tank.
