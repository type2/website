Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Removal article

Thanks to Larry Edson I will be able to drop my engine and install my 
flaps and thermostat as well as change the fan and put in a front 
(rear?) engine seal.  He kindly offered me to use his place.  Another 
proof that we have some great people in our community.

Hopefully I will take enough pics to make a decent documentation of the 
whole thing so others don't have to make the mistakes I made the first 
time I pulled my engine ;-) .

Now I can't promise to do as good of a job as Richard but I'll try.
