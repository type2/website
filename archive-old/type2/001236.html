I have tried to search the archives on this but I keep getting silly
messages, so sorry if it's a repeat.

I've need a new wiper switch, this one has snapped.

Does anyone, anywhere in the world, have a wiper switch that does something
when it is clicked down? (this does nothing on mine, and has no electrical
contact).

I am also tring to sort out the problem I have with my main beam lights
coming on by suprise when I trun on my lights because I have flashed them
earlier in the day, anyone sorted this?
