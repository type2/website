Subject: [T2] sealing up bus

My bus is not and likely will never be dry and straight (Why did i ever
sell my 73?!, i was second owner not even a dent, lotsa  rust though).
I've been thinking about using aftermarket seals to try to close the
gaps around my doors to keep the heat in and the weather out.
Specifically i have seen some generic weather stripping in JC whitney (
i know that most of what they sell is seconds but i figure it'd be hard
to mess this stuff up) any one have any experience with this? Any other
suggestions?
thanks in advance
jamie
