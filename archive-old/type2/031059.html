&gt; I want to install a surf rack to the top of my 1970 westy  pop-top. Sounds 
&gt; easy, Not so, I park  in a garage and only have 2 inches of clearance now. So 
&gt; the rack  will have to be portable. For local stuff  I put my boards inside 

ski shops have snowboard mounting systems that mount on the side of
vehicles that are too tall for garages or have no rain gutters.

while I ski I throw my gear into the back of the van and have not looked
into them, but I see them in the parking lots all the time, some look
pretty flimsy some though look very well made.

just a thought but it might be another solution
