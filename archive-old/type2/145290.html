 I heard back from the insurance company they are
 saying the bus is a total loss.

 Also how does buying the bus back from them work?
 Would it have a salvage title?
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------

If they declare it a total and you settle on a price,
they will also have a salvage bid on it from a
wrecking yard. You can buy the vehicle back for the
salvage bid, which they then subtract from the price
they are paying you. Here in California, you then need
to send the license plates and the title back to DMV
in Sacremento and they issue a salvage title. The
insurance company has to notify DMV that they are
totalling a vehicle. And the salvage value IS
negotiable. When my 66 bus was totalled, I negotiated
the buy back figure down to $10!!!

Others things I have learned:
If they don't total it and they agree on a repair
figure and you decide to fix it later, they do NOT
have to pay you the repair figure at 100%. They only
will pay 1/2 and then when you take it somewhere to
get it fixed, then they pay the other 1/2.

If you have a salvage title issued [in Calif], you
will need to get a brake and light certification
inorder to register it.

If you don't send in the plates and title.... and the
current registration expires or is close to and DMV
mails you a renewal in the mail and you send in the
$50..... they keep it and will NOT refund the $$ or
send you the new registration. The ONLY way to get the
$50 back is to send them the plates and title. Even
though they sent you the renewal in error, they do not
make errors.....  Ask me how I know about this one!
