Subject: Re: [T2] Link to yellowbus of &quot;Little Miss Sunshine&quot; movie

 I was sent an invite from someone that is doing promotions for this to a
preview screening pretty cool here is the email:

Calling all VW enthusiasts.



I am working on the Washington, DC area promotions for the new film LITTLE
MISS SUNSHINE, starring Steve Carell, Greg Kinnear, Toni Collette, and a
very trusty, yellow VW van.  This bright yellow van is a central character
in the film - it never lets the family down on their crazy road trip to the
Little Miss Sunshine pageant.  I would love to invite you and your fellow VW
enthusiasts to attend an early screening of the film in Washington, DC;
Richmond, VA; or Norfolk, VA.  For more information on how you can RSVP to a
screening, please feel free to email me at izorich_at_alliedadvpub_dot_com.  I also
have movie posters and promotional items to send out to VW groups, so please
let me know if you are interested in receiving some fun items!



For more information on the film, please visit its website

Many thanks, and Happy Fourth of July!

LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE tells the story of the Hoovers, one of the most
endearingly fractured families ever seen on motion picture screens.
Together, the motley six-member family treks from Albuquerque to the Little
Miss Sunshine pageant in Redondo Beach, California, to fulfill the deepest
wish of 7-year-old Olive, an ordinary little girl with big dreams. Along the
way the family must deal with crushed dreams, heartbreaks, and a broken-down
VW bus, leading up to the surreal Little Miss Sunshine competition itself.
On their travels through this bizarrely funny landscape, the Hoovers learn
to trust and support each other along the path of life, no matter what the
challenge.  Rated R.
