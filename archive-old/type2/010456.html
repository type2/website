Hey, I have a problem. Everytime I put my bus in 
reverse it pops out of gear...it'll go in reverse for
a little ways and then pop right out. I know that is
what happens when your tranny is going bad but does'nt
it usually start with 4th Gear?? Someone mentioned
that it may be a &quot;linkage&quot; problem. Anyone have any
ideas on how I can check the linkage?? Also, I've been
told that the tranny is for a 73..which my bus is but
it has a 78 engine it. Could that be the problem?
Please email me if you have any info on what the
problem could be and how to fix it..I'm just hoping it
is not the tranny..I can't afford to shed out 1000
bucks right now..Email me directly with any
info..Thanks

Greg
