&gt;The local shop (Fred's in Redwood City, CA) quoted ~$1900 for a valve
&gt;job. I've heard only good things about them, so it's probably a fair
&gt;price, but I've learned my lesson and will check everything before
&gt;jumping in! Is this price standard?

A new head costs $200. If he doesn't mark it up he's charging $1700 to R&amp;R the head which involves dropping the engine. If his labor rate was $85/hr. thats 20 hours of labor which is think is about twice too long.

&gt; Is it possible to take the heads off myself and
&gt;have the work done for far less dollars?

Of course. Do you have a metric toolset (probably if you have a Japanese motorcycle). How about a floor jack and a flat parking space to work on the engine?

&gt;Thanks for any and all assistance with this. I'm hoping to get out of
&gt;this crappy situation with as little damage to my wallet as possible -
&gt;I certainly wasn't anticipating these costs right off the bat. The
&gt;engine was supposedly replaced with a GEX rebuild 15,000 miles ago.

If you have a GEX and have gone 15k miles you might as well leave it in until you truly need a new engine.
