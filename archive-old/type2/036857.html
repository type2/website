John and Volks -

I have a more global question regarding cams/carbs. Is there a matrix or
something that approximately identifies what cam grind goes with a certain
carb setup? For instance, what cam grind would go well with a 30-PICT,
34-PICT-3 (rejetted), Kadrons, Baby DO's, etc?

I've heard that certain carbs are not a &quot;good match&quot; for certain cams, but
why? A piston travelling down a cylinder can only pull in air/gas so fast,
regardless of cam (and here we go..), no?

&gt; what cam? 1.25s are a waste of money; ad 1.4s or 1.5s.
