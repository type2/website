&gt; I have tried this in the past and even went to a local metric bolt company,
&gt; and no luck.  The difference is in the head.  It has a screw type head, and
&gt; other than bolts, have had no luck.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I was wondering if there is a source for the screws that attach the
&gt; luggage
&gt; &gt; &gt; rack &amp; poptop to the bus.

I went to my local Mom &amp; Pop hardware store and found everything I needed to
convert my pop top screws, nuts, and bolts to stainless.  They had a much
larger selection of stainless than the big guys.  I just used standard sized
hardware of the appropriate size as I saw no reason to struggle finding metric
stainless.  I didn't replace the bolts that attach the hinge to the roof though
because I haven't found the appropriate metric stainless yet.
