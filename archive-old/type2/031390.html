Woody got it at BNNTA last September and has had it ever since. I had made
a post about BNNTA shortly after the event on the vintagebus and vintagvw
listserves about it heading to Nebraska.  The gal that was running the
hubcap server made some post that said, &quot;Once again the wishes have been
totally disregarded and blah blah blah.&quot;  I had NO idea that there was an
itinerary for the hubcap so at that point I said screw it.  I still
maintain that stance.  I saw the hubcap and the trinket as well as the
awesome stand Jamie Rivers made for it  and thought it
would be great to finally get the hubcap out in the Midwest.  Plans were
being made for Terry Wolfe of Omaha to go up and get it out of Michigan or
Minnesota.
My reply to the post about the wishes of the hubcap team not being
hondored was
so blatant that I guess I got the original webmaster all pissed off and
she quit.  Someone else was running it but I don't know who.

So I've been the hubcap bad guy ever since.  It's a neat piece of
memorbilia and I would have been honored to haul it from one point to
another but it seems there is always someone crying and bitching about
them not getting a chance at it but cripes, no one is ever willing to
drive a long ways to get it.  Terry was willing to drive 600 some miles
one way in his 1965 Westy (stock gear) to get it out to the Midwest.

I'm soured on the whole hubcap thing since last September.  It's neat and
all but the politics that go with it make me want to distance myself from
it all the more.
