Subject: Re: [T2] Door locks

Actually, this sounds a little like the issue I had when I had to replace
the door trigger in the outside handle, recently.

If all else fails, remove the external handle ( 2, 5mm allen bolts on the
inside ), and loosen the philips head screw holding the plate onto the end
of the keylock barrel, there's a little bit of movement in the position, and
I found to get the door to lock with the key, I had to move it around a bit
in the same direction as the key movement ( then tighten it up again, of
course ). Maybe over in the land of snow n ice ( in winter, anyway ), the
extra strain on the locks can move the locking plate a little?

Hope this is of use.

&gt; Thank you, George! I haven't even looked at the article yet, but now that
&gt; you mention a &quot;little spring&quot;, it makes perfect sense. The door lock
&gt; mechanism works, but doesn't quite activate the mechanism. It feels as if
a
&gt; little extra push or pull is needed, and a little spring could do just the
&gt; trick. ;0)
