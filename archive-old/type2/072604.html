I've installed a Berg Breather Box on the 1776 that I am rebuilding and am
ready to connect the hoses.

There are three ports on the BBB  -   two inlets and one outlet, according
to the catalog.  The instructions say that the top port is the outlet.
This one I know what to do with. I'll connect it to the air cleaner port of
one of my Kadrons.

Can someone suggest what I should do with the inlet ports?  Inlet from
what?  I can't imagine what their functions is.

thanks, Jack
