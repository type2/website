Bus Folx,

Last night while pouring over my Bentley/Muir/Haynes trying to learn
something about the vapor recovery system, officially called the
Evaporative Emission Control or EEC (slim pickins BTW), I found this
gem in Bentley...

It says the charcoal canister should be replaced every 30,000 miles!

Has anyone EVER done this?  Could the old one just be refilled with
charcoal from a pet/fish supply store?  Maybe mix it up with some
cotton balls or steel wool or something, so air can flow through?

Just curious,
Rodney
