&gt;Although this vendor operates on a forbidden web site, I thought it of 
&gt;interest to the group the fact that he offers to manufacture NLA parts. I 
&gt;follow his listings because he travels to germany regularly and brings parts 
&gt;to his Santa Ana warehouse. In fact if you follow his link below, you will 
&gt;notice some NOS bus parts currently available. I thought of Don's tail light 
&gt;episode when I saw them listed.

Thank you for mentioning this. I'd lost the sellers name about a year ago and it's driven me crazy ever since.

This guy sells NOS German complete nose panels: #7901009737.

I remember when he had a stack of 9 or so but now it looks like he's down to just 3.
