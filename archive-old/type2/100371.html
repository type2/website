Subject: Re: [T2] so, if I am testing for shorts, what am I doing wrong?

You wrote:

&gt;I know I should check in amps, but really, if 12 v is rolling through, 
&gt;isn't
&gt;that just as much an indicator?
&gt;
&gt;Well, my question is, what else can I check? Am I doing something wrong?




The test results you describe indicates an electrical load is connected from 
the positive side of the battery to ground. This is be normal unless 
everything is disconnected.

The question is, is it 5 milliamps a desired load (to the radio memory as an 
example) or 5 amps to some undesired load.

You need to use the ammeter function (start with the highest range) to 
determine if it is a trivial desired drain or a higher and maybe undesired 
one.
