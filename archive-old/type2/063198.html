Subject: pushstarting a FI Westy

Re pushstarting your bus-Jay Goldberg gives  the right routine, but don't
forget that FI engines have the saftey feature of fuel pump running for
only 10 seconds when ignition is turned on-So don't turn on that ignition
until you are actually beginning to roll pretty good!
