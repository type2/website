Subject: DM: List procedure enhancement
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.5.32.19991023162658.0081e100_at_rockisland_dot_com&gt;

I have been inundated with e-mails from my initial participation on the
list. Demand outstrips supply. Must modernfy my procedure.

1.) I will not be sending directly to the web site responses, only whole
cloth original subject submittals when I feel they are of good common use
to the listees.

2.) The bulk of my e-mails will go off list. Anyone who receives an e-mail
from me is given license (revolkable at any time) to edit my responce to
them, WITHOUT ANY OUT OF CONTEXT SENANIGANS, and submit to the site if THEY
feel it is relevant or of value.

3.) I am perfectly capable of filtering out the flame throwers who misuse
this license. I am experienced in extinguising open flames in my vicinity,
or haven't you heard??

4.) There are plenty of listees with excellent knowledge to anwer basic
questions. I will rely on them to continue to do so. I will respond if it
appears that standard proceedures are not getting a good result by
providing ideas about enhancing proceedures to find that intermitant glitch
or if I have a little trick of the trade that will reduce your efforts.

Wishing I was Bill Gates and could send every listee, minus flamethrowers,
a million bucks so you could resurrect every VW with potential for
continued safe, dependable use.

Regards, and thank you for the feedback.
