Mark Rokus, thanks...

I just wired a small piezo (sic) buzzer as you suggested.  It works great!!!

It is a 12VDC, range 7.0 - 17VDC, 15mA max at 12VDC, with 75dB sound.

Got it at Radio Shack, as you suggested.  Two bucks, I think.

I found my parking light wire/spade on the light switch (I took the light 
switch out of the dash.  Simple to do, and it made the job simply 
enjoyable.)  It was a gray wire.  This became my power (red - positive)to 
the buzzer.

Then I found a spade on the light switch itself that ran off the ignition, a 
black wire, with some kind of stripe, I think.  This spade got power when 
the ignition switch (key) was turned on and dropped power when the ignition 
switch (key) was turned off, so this became my ground (black - negative) to 
the buzzer.

Since I had this tiny buzzer, with tiny wires, I simply tied the buzzer on 
to a wire coming out of the light switch, and pulled the connectors off both 
the parking light spade, and the power-with-ignition-on spade.  Then I 
slipped both connectors back on to the spades, catching the tips of the two 
buzzer wires as I did so.

It works just as you said: when both sides of the buzzer get juice, no 
noise.  When the black - negative side drops power, it becomes a ground, and 
the buzzer is fed by the parking light red - positive and the buzzer makes 
an alert noise.  When I push the light switch all the way in, then the 
buzzer gets no juice and stops.

It feels a little uncomfortable now, because my buzzer goes off when I pull 
the light switch out, even for just the parking lights (which is EXACTLY 
what I want!!)

I am cc: the list because it is such a great idea.

BTW, Burneskis is a Lithuanian name.
