&gt; I wish I could just ignore it.For whatever reason my bus has this solenoid

don't know why you would need it, can you put a doubler on the other
terminal and use it that way???

in any case I am pretty sure my spare starter has the second terminal (3
total) on the solenoid but I don't need it or use it.  that's the good
news I would swap working for working starter  BUT!!! mine is for an
automatic and I would need one for an automatic (since my bus is an
automatic 78)

shipping costs on these can be rough since they are so heavy,  I'm in
