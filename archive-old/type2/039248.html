   I've been phoning around trying to find new tires for my 73 Westy and
found
a Dunlop light truck tire. The # is splt5 and it comes in 6 or 8 ply rating
in a 185/r14.
Anyone run these? Is this an alright tire to buy?
Cost is 122$Can. each, installed and balanced.
I called my VW dealer and they want 153$ each for Continentals!

Thanks
