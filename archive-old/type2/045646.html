Subject: [T2] Save this bus

Okay folks the time has come, I'm in the process of selling my house and 
relocating. After agonizing I've decided the 69 westy has to go. This could 
be a real cool ride, it's a bench seat, has M codes for the ambulence fans 
and a gas heater (of course missing) has a full length complete belly pan not 
just the outriggers, has the small popyop, no engine or trans. I really want 
to save this from the junkyard, $100 bucks to a good home. Also have 
Icebox/sink combo from a walkthru $75
thanks all
Chuck
