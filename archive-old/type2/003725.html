Alright Here is the story.  Last week my 72 Westie lost a RR tire.  I was
stopped so no body damage but when the axle feel out of the drum it hit the
drum and chipped it.  Ok Ordered a used stub axle and new German boots with
grease.  Located Drum, Axle nut and cotter key in town.  Got brake pads to
do that while I was in there also.  So far so good.  Go over to a
friends(Dick Bozarth( Thanks Dick)) and he shows and does the work on
repacking the CVJ joints so I bring it home and get both CVJ joints tourgued
down(25 lbs) and do the brakes and put on the drum and then put on the big
nut and tighten it down but it is tight about a 1/2 inch short so that the
drum and the CVJ joint move back and forth by 1/2 inch through the bearing
and the backing plate.  Ok what did I do wrong?  Pull it apart by just
unhooking from the Transaxle and then pulling the CVJ joints, stub axle and
the inside axle out as one unit.  Lay it down and start tring to figure what
is stopping it from fitting all the way in.  Hook it all back up(did not
torque again though  just finger tight) and same deal.  Pull out again and
lay down and get the old one and sure enough the new one is about a inch
longer and the splines don't go as far down the shaft so that the drum does
not go into the recessed area for the bearings and push that 3/4 inch shim
into the bearing.  It misses by about a 1/2 a inch.  Does anybody know what
years I need to get for my bus stub axle.  It is a 72 bus with a type 4
motor.  In the Idiot manual it shows on Page 175 of Edition 17 in Brakes
section a couple of drawings of brake drums and a picture that shows that if
you have a Type 1,3,4 the brakes are this way and if you have a Type 2 the
brakes are upside down.  Well I have a Type 2 but with a Type 4 motor but my
brakes are the first way the type 1,3,4 way not the Type 2.  Is this how 72
busses were or has someone changed my transaxle.  Or is the Type 4 stock and
came with the type 4  brake components.  I am pretty frustrated as I thought
that there was one stub axle length for bay windows.  Anybody know what
years i need to look for or any partnumber placement on stub axles.  Guess I
just needed to rant a little  Thanks for your time and I already feel better
knowing that you reading this just knows the answers to my questions?  And
the lesson  compare the old and the new parts before you are on your back
holding 23 axles and 2 CVJ joints up while trying to keep the grease in the
joints on a 90 degree day and the dirt and rust out of the grease.  Moral of
story  &lt;COMPARE YOUR REPLACEMENT PARTS&gt;
