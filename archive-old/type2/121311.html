Subject: New York Ready Or Not Here We Come

Hello,

  The time has come for us to depart to New York.  I looked at the weather
up there this afternoon and the feels like temperature was 3.

  The bus has had a full rubdown.  Washed, waxed, Fog-Xd, and Rain Xd. 
My arms are dangling uselessly at my sides.

  Never did get to adjust the valves, found that the person who put them
on last glued them to the heads and for the life of me I couldnt get
them off.  I tried all kinds of machinations, to no avail.  Even Brute
Force (my husband) couldnt budge them.

  So we are off, a deceptively average looking expedition.  Venturing off
into the cold unknown.  No fuel gauge, little heat, missing hubcap, and
all.  We did manage to get the inverter installed, for which I will be
grateful.  There are two laptops going that will add to the cacophony,
Lord of the Rings and Speed Racer.  As for myself, I have ear plugs.

  Sincere thanks to everyone on this list who has helped and encouraged me
through this and this that is yet to come.

Jennifer
