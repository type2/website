Oh dear,

I'm afraid this is $$$$ Drew.

&gt;From your words it sounds like you've connected the battery the wrong way round!
The -ve post is smaller than the +ve post hence it was tight getting it on.

The alternator gets shot when you do this because the diodes in it are 
electrically directional.

If the ignition was off (probably was) then I think you will have saved your
radio and FI computer. Check your car burgler alarm (assuming you have one) as
they will be permanenty connected.

PS My Dad done this a few weeks ago on his Renault Traffic van so you are not 
alone!

Sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings

Bob
