Subject: flywheel nut

hello volx

what is the 'easiest' way to get the 36 mm nut that holds the 
flywheel on a 1600 off?  i tried with a .5 in drive impact.  no 
luck...

also, the reason my engine needs a rebuild is b/c i dropped a valve.  
this could have damaged the case, right?  how do i know?  can i take 
it apart, look at it and tell, or do i have to take it to someone and 
have it checked out?

thanx
