Subject: RE: [T2] Aftermarkey wheels for a Bay

&gt; A tire is a fulcrum and if you understand physics... the bigger the
&gt; fulcrum the more weight can be moved by less energy being exerted.
&gt; Doesn't matter where the speedometer cable is located, on the tranny or
&gt; on the front drivers wheel in a little cap. Even with it being there you
&gt; can see the difference that little cap has to make for one whole
&gt; rotation as compared to the smaller tire.  No holy grail, just simple
&gt; understanding of mechanical engineering.


Im sorry Fay or Scott but you have seriously failed physics.
The deal with a lever (fulcrum) is that you trade off distance moved and
force needed. The work force x distance is still the same.
A bigger tire moving at the same rpm  requires more power input.
Even you cant change the laws of physics. Thats why they are LAWS and not
just theories.
