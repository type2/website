Subject: Fixing the heating system.

Hello everyone.

  Been working on getting the heat to work in my bus.  I have a '74 type4.
With the heater fan is on, I get a lot of air flow, and it pumps into the 
heat exchangers very powerfully. However, it doesn't make it to the front
- and that's the problem.

  I'm fairly certain that the pulleys are all messed up.  Unfortunately, I
don't know all the names to the heat-tube elements, so if I tried to
explain, I would only confuse myself and others.

  So, if anyone knows of a good source for information concerning the
heating system, I would really appreciate the info.  Additionally, if
someone knows what they are doing, maybe they could let me know and I'll
try to explain what I see, what I think might be wrong, and hope that
they can help me find a cure. :)

  Hope the holidays treat you right!

  Happy driving,

    Wade
