Subject: replacing lifters

Recently theres been discussion around lifter noise. I have pulled my engine 
for a clutch issue, but also had lifter noise after allowing engine to sit for 
two weeks. After 20 minutes it went away...the bleed down period seems to be 
normal if engine hasn't run in awhile. Question is...now that my engine is 
out...should I go thru the trouble of replacing lifters? Recommended or Not?
