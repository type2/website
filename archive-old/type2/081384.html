Subject: Re: [T2] Manual trans fluid

Here is the Valvoline site on gear oil. It is dated 2001. Not a word about
MT-1! Read all the different types of GL-4 and the key phrase about each one:
&quot;should be used where an API GL-4 oil is specified by the manufacturer.&quot;
http://www.essport-online_dot_com/gear_oils.htm

Here is a BP site from Australia from 1999 that does not know about MT-1
either!
http://www.bp_dot_com.au/products/lubricants/top_20_lube_products/energear.asp

Here is another gear oil website:
http://www.lubrichem_dot_net/ProductsCatalog/Products/ATF.htm
Here is the section on GL-4 [nothing about MT-1!]:

LUBRICHEM GL-4 EP Gear Oils are mild EP gear lubricants designed for a wide
range of automotive and industrial applications. They are specifically
recommended for manual transmissions and differentials in automotive, truck,
and off-highway vehicles not requiring a GL-5 product. API GL-4 gear oils may
be used wherever GL-3, GL-2, or GL-1 gear oils are recommended. Available as
SAE: 90 and 140.

Here is the definition of SAE J-308, gear oil classification system: It is on
page 13 of this pdf:
http://www.munroeequipment_dot_com/lubricantformulation.pdf

API GL-1    Low additive treats, Most industrial applications,
API GL-2    and Special automotive applications


API GL-3    Medium additive treats, Automotive transmissions,
API GL-4    and Moderately loaded axles


API GL-5    High additive treats, High off-set hypoid axles,
API GL-6    and Shock loaded gear boxes

&gt; &lt;&lt;  Well, this has been done to death. Just fill the freaking thing with a
&gt; good
&gt; &gt; GL-4 lube or Redline MT-90 and Shut the F*&amp;k up. ( to borrow a saying from
&gt; &gt; D. Leary). Christ, you folks should know better than to argue with the
&gt; &gt; newbies, it never works out. Let 'em fry a tranny or two......They'll
&gt; &gt; figure it out then.

&gt; Compassionate conservatism...?-(
&gt; Any (accurate) info is good info, especially for newbies. We weren't
&gt; all born with innate VW knowledge, BTW. A lot of what was considered
&gt; common knowledge has been empirically proven false - 009 distributor,
&gt; cooling flaps removal, etc.
&gt; Case in point, a counterman at a local FLAPS, (who drives an early 911,
&gt; BTW), argued with me about GL-4/GL-5...His defense of GL-5? The
&gt; Porsche dealer he gets his parts from said it's OK...Now this guy's no
&gt; mechanical dummy...His Porsche is rebuilt and reliably fast.
&gt; Besides, in a purely self-serving mode, I'd rather keep a newby's trans
&gt; in good working condition...Maybe he'll keep the rest of it up too, and
&gt; buy parts from BustedBus, or BusDepot, keeping them in business so
&gt; you and I have a place to buy parts from...
&gt; As an aside...Anybody else remember dealing with British cars? I've
&gt; often wondered how many ended up trashed because of using the
&gt; wrong brake fluid (a GL-4/5 comparison)...?-(
