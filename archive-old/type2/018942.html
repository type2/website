&gt; Hello all...
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I went for it.  I got the 76 Westy I was pondering about for the last
&gt; week.  She is a real beauty!  Thanks again to all who gave their advice
&gt; while I was debating with myself.

Congrats!
NOW! Check or replace the fuel hoses! (Unless you can verify that it's
been done in the last two years.) Don't forget those two pieces
underneath that hook to the tank!
Then you can relax and enjoy.
