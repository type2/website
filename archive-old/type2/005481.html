&gt;  Thinkin' to replace Ramona's fuel pump since I have noticed a lack of
power

&gt;right, top side of the pump cover.
&gt;  Called our little Small Car World, and Jim there said he had one for like
&gt;$15! Why does that sound so cheap to me?? I was expecting twice that,
That's a good fair price.  You might be able to just pull the top cover and
replace the gasket.  While there, clean the screen that lives inside.  If
you need to replace, its an easy job, but the new pumps don't have the
removeable cover and screen.  One more note, if you have an alternator
conversion, you need the 73 and later pump.
