&gt;A l:  This brings up a question. I have searched the area where I live  -
&gt;Northern Virginia - and have not found a source of unusual oils like the 40

Olympic in DC had on the shelf (and I was amazed) Castrol Racing in 30 and
50, around me (and presumeably also DC) Autozone stores Castrol HD in 30 or
40 straight.  All great oil, at Autozone about $1.32 per qt.  Not sure about
Olympics price or if the Castrol &quot;racing&quot; is any different from the &quot;HD&quot;  A
lot of chain stores sell 30 and 40 straight, but I'd avoid all house brands
like a plague when it comes to these, Castrol or Valvoline (also often
marked &quot;racing&quot;) are great choices.  One of the cleanest engines I've ever
seen, with not a trace of burnt oil in the rocker boxes at 95k miles ('77
T4) has had 40 in the summer, 30 in the winter, it's entire life.  Almost
enough to make me an old time believer.
