&gt; &gt; Thanks again to all,
&gt;
&gt; I don't think the hose between the tank and the filter, and between the
&gt; filter and the pump, actually needs to be high pressure hose.  The only
&gt; sections that are really under pressure are the ones after the pump,
&gt; including the return line to the tank.  However, it certainly doesn't
&gt; hurt to use high-pressure hose between the tank and the filter, which
&gt; you might as well do if you're replacing your other fuel lines.  But
&gt; I'm not sure you can even get high-pressure hose for between the filter
&gt; and the pump.


What you have to be careful of here, is the hose collapsing,, NOT blowing
apart with pressure.

I found what I thought to be good quality hose,, the smaller hose was
rated over 100psi,, and the larger hose was 35psi and stated fuel
injection grade on it...

I converted a Carb Tank to use for efi,, by installing a 3/8&quot; steel line
for the outlet,[9.5mm], 3/8&quot; fi flexible hose, then a short length of 3/8&quot;
steel line that I was able to stretch the 7.5mm hose over ,, so that I
could connect the filter to the 7.5mm hose...

Between the filter and the pump, I used the 35psi Fi hose,, about 10&quot; long,,,
This hose sucked FLAT at highway speeds,, and the engine would stall......
 no fuel pressure!

After searching everything under the sun , and the bus as well,, I finally
found out what was restricting the fuel flow at high demand,,  The hose
collapsed !

I shortened that hose to resemble the exact way Vw installed it,, to about
2&quot; long.... and 1&quot; covers the filter outlet nipple,, the other 1&quot; covers
the pump inlet nipple.  There is no way it can collapse now..

Btw,, it took about 1500 miles for that NEW hose to soften up with fuel
and be under the stress of the draw of the fuel pump suction to cause the
bus to stall,, all of a sudden,, coincidental to running ethanol fuel in
South Dakota,,
Now,, I don't think it had anything to do with the fuel.... but everyone
else was blaming the ethanol
