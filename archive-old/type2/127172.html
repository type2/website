Subject: Re: [T2] rebuilding a type IV 2 liter

http://www.cip1_dot_com/   CIP1 has the camshaft and the
solid lifters, the cam is reworked for 59.95,($10.00
less if you send a core,but I think postage would eat
up any savings on this)I think the lifters are 5.95
each, rember when you install the cam and lifters you
must go through the break-in procedures for installing
a new cam. good luck with it... Phil
