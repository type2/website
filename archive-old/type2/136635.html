Subject: Re: [T2] High-lift jack?

Mike,

I've managed with the 14.5&quot; lift craftsman floor jack I have. I put the
bus up on ramps instead of stands this last drop and lowered the engine
with my floor jack. My ATV jack was several inches short of useful,
however. I'm working on bays here. Your mileage likely varies with the
vanagon.

&gt; forgot to measure this morning before leaving for work. Do I need a
&gt; &quot;high-lift&quot; jack, or will a standard jack do the trick? It seems that
&gt; 16&quot; of lift might not be enough (high-lift gives me 21&quot;). This is for
&gt; jacking up the rear end for an engine drop on an '83 Vanagon.
