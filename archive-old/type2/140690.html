Subject: Late Bus Wiring

Volks,

It has been a _long_ time since last I posted; I've been lurking as I've
made a interstate move, etc.  As it is, I'm now looking to finish-up the
resto on my '78 Westy.

The interior is completely gutted, from having been professionally painted.
That being, I thought I'd take advantage of the situation and rectify thirty
years worth of mine and D.P.O. hacking and splicing at all the wiring.

As wiring harness kits are unavailable for late Buses, I'm thinking of a
universal kit.  Seems, though, that these are primarily sold for the GM/Ford
rodder crowd.  Will it work?

Any experiences in this regard that you care to share?  I want to run fresh
wire from headlight buckets to tail, including the use of a new blade-style
fuse box.  Will the commonly-available kits have enough wire to stretch the
length of my Bus?

Thanks!
