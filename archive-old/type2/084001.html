Subject: Re: [T2] Please Help, trouble with #2's spark plug angle

The secret is to memorize the location of a long extension on the plug
before you unscrew it!  I've marked the hatch ceiling to know where to
position the upper end!  As to putting it in, get a 8 - 10&quot; extension
that LOCKS onto the socket (Sears), and make sure the foam in the socket
will grip the plug. With the air cleaner out, you can peer in the shroud
hole and see the plug hole, but you gotta look to the right and back of
the shroud hole.  If you must, take a dowel or other long probe and feel
to find the hole (the dowel will drop in) and you will see the angle. 
Put the plug/extension in at that angle and twirl by hand (never on the
ratchet) until you feel it threading without binding.  I do put
antisieze on it before inserting.  #3 is fun; you must use a 6&quot;
extension and it's right against the firewall.

&gt; 
&gt; I am having a rough time finding the right angle to install my spark
&gt; plug in the #2 cylinder of my Type 2 Westy (type 4 engine I think).
