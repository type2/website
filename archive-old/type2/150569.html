&amp;gt; Hmm... What's the benefit of using an analog clock vs the one on the stereo?
&amp;gt; If I'm sleeping in the bus I can't see a &amp;quot;stock&amp;quot; clock anyway.

&amp;gt; I'd rather have a tach in that hole...

Which brings up a question.  Was there any accessory other than a clock
that could be ordered to fit that hole?  Tachs were very unusual in the
'60s and '70s and would be just about unknown on a utility vehicle like a
bus.
