It probably wouldn't hurt a thing to burn veggie oil.  After all, we eat a
goodly amount of it whenever we enjoy an order of fries!

Traditionally, waste oil goes to a rendering plant where it is converted
into base materials for other products such as pharmceuticals and
cosmetics.

It isn't well publicised, but most &quot;recycled&quot; motor oil is used as bunker
fuel for ships, so it ends up being burned anyway!
