Subject: 1972 mechanical fuel pump options

Hello

Anyone know where to get a fuel pump rebuild kit and part number  for the
mechnical fuel pump originally installed on a 1972 type 4 1700?  Lokks like a
two year part, and I can't seem to find a rebuild kit.   Are there any sources
for a replacement?   Any good ideas as to how to install an electric unit?  Do
you just leave the mechaical one in place, and bypass it?

Thanks in advance
