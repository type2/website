Subject: Re: [T2] Head Temp Sensor

Jeremy:
Perhaps the best thing would be to drill and tap a new hole into the head at
10mm by 1.0. Might be a little hard to fine a tap. You can put it on the right
head and lengthen the wire slightly.

&gt; There's been a lot of chat about the head temp sensor lately. A friend of
&gt; mine came over with her 78 westy (we originally met due to AIRS). She has
&gt; been having some wierd problems with low idle and the motor dying at
&gt; stoplights. i figured i would just spin the head sensor and make sure it was
&gt; tight. When i wiggled it, it came out. Seems it was wrapped in a spring and
&gt; stuffed into a hole that was MUCH larger than stock head sensor diameter.
&gt; Now, what do i do?
&gt; I was thinking:
&gt; 1. i could JB WELD the sensor in (cheap, not very professional)
&gt; 2. leave the sensor off and just unhook it (probably not a good idea)
&gt; 3. Ask for some advice.
&gt; ANY Thoughts?
&gt; Thanks
