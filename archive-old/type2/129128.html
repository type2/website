Subject: TIN IS FUN

Hello everyone,

Just thought I'd share a fun experience with the tin.
Put the engine back in, put all the tin in place, put the fan housing,
alternator etc. in there.
2 pieces of tin left. can't remember where those babies go.
try looking for where they would go? look in the book.
note: the oil cooler and alternator tin must be installed before
the rest of the tin and with the fan housing removed.
aaaaahhhh.
take it all apart and start again.

i guess you gotta learn the hard way sometimes!
take care,
Darren
