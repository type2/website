Subject: Re: Progress and life... my story

Good to hear that you had such a good weekend. I, OTOH, had a bad bus 
weekend.... My main goal was to pull the engine this weekend. Didn't get to 
it Saturday, but got to it about 2 yesterday afternoon. Was going fine. After 
5 years, it all came back to me and I only referred to the Bently Bible once 
or twice. Then, I lost the muffler - the exhaust tip broke right off. Oh 
well, I needed a new one anyway. Then, I lost the tow hitch. I got one side 
loosened, and then it fell dangerously close to me and cracked. No good no 
more. Oh well, I never used it and if it was that weak, I didn't want to. The 
whole time I'm under there, though, I've got a wrench in one hand and a can 
of bug spray in the other trying to fight of this wasp that had taken up 
residence somewhere under there. We played cat and mouse for about an hour. 
Then I got stung on my hand - a sneak attack. I wasn't sure if that was legal 
in the peace accord that we had struck. I shook it off and worked some more 
until I was ready to put the floor jack under the engine and drop it. I took 
a break. When I went back out, I realized that my hand had swollen up to 
immense cartoon proportions. I looked like I had a Mickey Mouse hand. I 
couldn't even hold a wrench.  The evening was spent with a good traditional 
dinner of bacon, eggs and home made hashbrowns and then a restfull night on 
the couch popping Benadryl with my hand on ice and watching Plan 9 from Outer 
Space. This morning I wake up at five am and my hand is better, but still not 
sure if I can do any work - I went back to bed. Now I'm thinking that I might 
just be able to get some work done - if that pesky little insect isn't out 
there.
