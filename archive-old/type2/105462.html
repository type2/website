Subject: Door hinges

Earlier this month I posted a request on what I would have to do to fit front
doors of an earlier year on my '77. I only received off- list advise from
Jeff. However, I mis-represented the year. I really have a '76!

The unrusted doors I picked up have the locks below the handle (like I
prefer). I know that my old '72 had locks like that, but don't know what other
years did. The hinges are different from my current model '76. How do I alter
them to fit?

Thanks,
            Mike
