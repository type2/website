Subject: Anyone need anything?

Well, my 78 is pretty much sold and although there is a pile of parts going
with it, I still have several westy's worth of spare parts to clean out of
my garage.

If you need anything tell me what you're looking for and I'll see if it's
still around - this includes interior, engine, trim and (some) mechanical.
Once the 78 is out of the garage I'll get more organized and post what I
have to the list.

Thanks!

John Runberg
