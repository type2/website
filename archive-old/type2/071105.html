Subject: FI to Duals project started
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Well, the project began today and ended with the fuel injected motor out and 
on a pallet.  The next step is to (correct me if I'm wrong)  run a tube for 
the new throttle cable, disconnect the electric fuel pump, and run new fuel 
lines and then get the new motor in yeh???  All the fuel injection spaghetti 
is pulled.  Is there a secret to dropping the motor, because I had a heck of 
a time keeping the rear support bar clear to back the motor out and even then 
it seemed ten times harder than I've been told it should take.  Also are 
there any helpful hints for getting the new motor in,  I think I'll have to 
do that by myself too. thanks
Peace Out
