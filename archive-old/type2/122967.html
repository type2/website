Subject: '73 Rear Bumper Bracket Source

Duane,

I set a set USED ($50 plus shipping/handling from Seattle)

you wrote:
I have a 1973 VW T2 Standard Bus/Station Wagon that is missing the rear
bumper and rear bumper brackets. I have lots of sources for the rear bumper,
but am coming up empty for those rear brackets. Can anyone help me with a
source?

&quot;obligatory disclaimer&quot;
I am a &quot;virtual&quot; wrecking yard, selling
GOOD USED PARTS, mostly ORIGINAL STOCK.
These parts are thirty (+/-) years old,
That I pulled from a parts bus or traded...
I would use them on my buses, but they are
USED parts.    &quot;HAPPINESS GUARANTEED&quot;

Best Regards,
