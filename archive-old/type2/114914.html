Subject: FW: [T2] poptop seals

I installed the seals from busdepot_dot_com on my '78 westy this summer. On my
'78 westy, the elevating part is the rear 3/4 section of the roof.  The flat
blade part of the seal faces toward the front.

The other side of the seal has the slot that you have to insert the
roof/camper section into (the section that raises up).  You have to really
work it in there.  When the roof section is lowered, the front facing side
of the seal- the flat edge, presses down against the front &quot;securely mounted
to the roof&quot; section.

I can post a picture later today (i'm at work now) if anyone is interested.
