Steve,

Thanks! I still need to get the gas tank opened up to a useable state
though.  I am currently running out of a 2.5 gal gas can....hard to drive
around with that strapped on the side of the bus&lt;grin&gt;.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Dave,

&gt; Congratulations!  Good job!
&gt; 
&gt; For the hydraulic lifters... If it has been more than a week since the
&gt; engine last ran, I would say just take it out and drive it around for a
&gt; while, locally, on surface streets, at low speeds, for like 1/2 hour.  If
&gt; you have any that have not pumped up after that amount of time, they are
&gt; dead and should be replaced.  My theory on this is that a collapsed lifter
&gt; is allowing way too much clearance and too much clearance does not damage
&gt; an engine (in 1/2 hour) despite how it sounds.  It is too *little*
&gt; clearance that will damage an engine. (I await the various flames I will
&gt; soon be receiving :-)
&gt; 
&gt; On the too rich problem when you start it, again, let it warm up.  My '80
&gt; stinks of gas when cold, but is just fine once it warms up.  I think this
&gt; is &quot;normal&quot;, tho I don't like it much.
