Subject: Carb Adaptor options

Hey fellow listees,
	I have a '72 Bus with a 1700 CC Type 4 engine. The bus currently
has a Weber 32/36 with an incurable flat spot. This is the second carb
I've put on there, after rebuilding the first. Anyway... Can I just put a
single Solex 34 Pict 3 on there? I want simplicity, and reliability. I
don't have the money to spend on dual carbs, nor do I see that they are
actually what I am looking for. I know bug owners who use 34 Pict 3's on
their 1776 type 1's, so why can't I use it on my 1700 CC type 4?

Thanks,
John Tracy
'71, '72, and '78 Buses
