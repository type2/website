&gt; there anyway to avoid it?

Vapor lock occurs when the fuel delivery system gets heated up and
causes the fuel to boil.  This in turn leads to a lack of fuel pressure,
which, as you might imagine, means the engine isn't getting enough fuel
in the mixture.  Thus, engine looses power or dies.  While it can occur
at any elevation, vapor lock most commonly occurs at high altitudes,
such as when you're travelling through the mountains.  This is because
the higher elevation results in a lower boiling point for the fuel and
your engine is running harder (and hotter) to go up the mountain.  Also,
vapor lock is by far more common in carbureted engines, but is not
unheard of in a FI system.  In buses I imagine the fuel pump is the
common culprit, since the fuel lines are rubber hoses and would not
absorb as much heat.  I believe it can happen inside a carburetor as
well, but I'm not sure.

As far as prevention is concerned, keep the engine cool.  If it happens
during driving at normal elevations (&lt;5000 ft) then that's probably a
good sign that something's wrong and you're running too hot.

Of course, this shouldn't be confused with the hot-start problem common
in buses, which is caused not by a lack of fuel, but a lack of spark.
