&gt; &gt; Otherwise, if one of the shift forks broke or slipped (lock nut/bolt
&gt; &gt; loose), you could end up with 2 gears engaged at once, causing lockup of
&gt; &gt; the main shaft. In fact, standard procedure to tighten nuts on manual
&gt; &gt; tranny shafts is to engage 2 gears to lock the shafts. Any two will do.
&gt; &gt; Fork adjustment is critical.
&gt;
&gt;Can this be done with the transmission in and is it in any of the manuals? 
&gt;(Haven't looked yet) Or am I looking at pulling it and having it rebuilt?

I believe the Bentley shows complete tranny tear down and assembly. You 
have to go inside to check the forks, so you have to pull the tranny and 
get it on the bench.
