Hi all, this is long so a warning and sorry for the rambling if I do it =
=3Dp

I'm new to the type2 lists, just been reading it for a couple weeks =
(doing a lot of searches through the archives). I have rebuilt my old =
ford 77' f-250 engine about 5 times so I'm pretty good at working on =
engines.  By the end I had a 492cid (400 regular) engine where only the =
block was stock.  Amazing motor but only got 6mi/gal so taking it from =
AK to WA was out of the picture.  Now I'm a proud owner of a beautiful =
1972 baywindow =3Dp.

I'm rebuilding my 1972 automatic bay window. I have rebuilt my old ford =
77' f-250 engine about 5 times so I'm pretty good at working on engines. =
I bought it with the engine in pieces and without a transmission.  After =
decideing to keep it original and keep it auto instead of welding in a =
clutch tube and so such, I went to search for a auto trans.  I garnished =
a used one for 300 bones with all the linkage thank you Matthew from =
portland! I'm sure he reads this.

I want this auto tranny to last and have a couple questions.  I'm not =
sure exactly what I should do to keep this in top condition.  I figured =
change the filter and replace the tranny fluid, but I have no idea where =
to pick up a filter for this.  Also, I've seen in the archives that this =
tranny theoretically is the same as auto vw rabbit transmissions, bus =
transmissions, and various other vw autos through many years.  Should I =
be looking into replacing the torque converter since I have everything =
apart? I'm assuming a rabbit tranny uses a higher idle rpm so odds are =
the torque converter replacement wouldn't come from there.  Would a =
newer bus torque converter work? Has anyone had experience with this?  =
Also any material that I could find on the auto tranny would be top =
notch, I really want to learn this thing inside out.

Now, on to the engine.  The engine is in pieces but most are in good =
condition.  I have most of the parts to rebuild it as a 1700 (pistons =
that are a tad bit rusted but new not sure if they are salvagable) 2 =
1700 cranks I can turn, rods, lifters, gasket set.  Some of the stuff is =
looking a little hurting.  I also have a pair of 78' 2000cc heads in =
good condition.  Since it has an auto tranny,  and since I am building =
it up from scratch, I'd like to get some more power into it.

First off, I'm in Portland, OR and I was wondering if there is a very =
high quality, friendly service VW machine shop that knows their stuff =
inside and out.  I need my block hottanked &amp; bored for full flow and =
possibly clearance for a stroker kit, my heads rebuilt (more on this =
later),  and possible more little stuffs.  I really want someone who =
knows their %&amp;*$% as I've had some bad experiences in the past.  I'd =
also be willing to ship like the heads out of state for work.

On to the heads....

In the beginning I was going to go with the upgraded bus engine from =
Gex, my friend bought one and it runs ok (leaking oil though) and I've =
read some horror stories in the archives, so I decided against that.  I =
also saw http://www.importmotor_dot_com/ and they have some upgrade blocks =
and heads for my year, but I really want to get my hands in and rebuild =
it myself.  What I DID like from importmotor though was what they do to =
their heads -

Remanufactured Cylinder heads: Racing quality silicone maganese bronze =
valve guides. New technology valve seats to withstand the high heat =
demands of un-leaded gasoline. Three-angle performance-prepped valve =
seat machining. Professionally leak-tested prior to installation.

Now I'm upgrading to at least a 2000cc, so this poses an interesting =
problem.  First off, all 2000cc blocks are fuel injected that I know of =
with the smaller valves.  So I would have to have my heads custom done =
to properly fit with being carberated.  I'd also like to get some =
oversize valves in, I eyed the Gex heads (big valve bus ones) but then =
read about how they didn't properly do the seats and guides and still =
had problems with the seats failing.  Also I'm wondering if you can get =
the sodium filled valves in larger sizes? I'm assuming that the sodium =
filled are better than Stainless Steel because of the heat dissapation.  =
I need a head shop that can do the above mentioned stuff with the proper =
valve guides and the seats.   Who would you guys recommend?  AVP I've =
heard good things about however these would be custom heads and as far =
as I know they don't do this kind of work, I'd also really like to get =
this done local if possible.  But number one priority is I need guys who =
will treat the seats/guides right, and know this stuff so they could do =
some custom work.

On to the crank/pistons....

This is one I've been having problems with also, I'd really like to =
stroke it a bit, but not sure how it's going to impact the health of the =
engine.  I also havn't found any places that carry stroker kits for the =
type4.  I'd like some advice on where to buy my crank/pistons either =
2000cc or bigger from and what I should get.  Gex has some that I was =
eyeing, but scares me of course now =3Dp. =20

Cam....

I'm going to go hydraulic conversion and just wanted to make sure what I =
needed to get.  From what I've gathers a hydraulic lifter/cam kit with =
matching (shorter) pushrods is what I'd need.  I'm assuming the valve =
train is the same.  Also need recommondations on this.

Total Seal Rings...

I used these on my truck and would like to use these on my bus, however =
I had a bad problem.  The transmission was only controlled via vaccum =
from the engine and the total seal rings wacked it out because they have =
no loss etc.  Is this going to pose a problem on my auto on the bus?


Anyway, I'm getting ready to drop some cash soon, saving up now, and =
need to know where to look and what to save for.  This list is a great =
resource and I've hunted through the archives but havn't found answers =
to quite my answers =3Dp.
