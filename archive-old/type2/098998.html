Subject: removing vent and roll up windows from doors....

Man, I haven't had such a problem as when I removed the windows from the 
doors last night.

It said in the Bentley and the Haynes man. to &quot;push the front guide channel 
off it's bracket, and pull the regulator through the gap thus formed.&quot;

Well, I really had to 'push' it, I mean with a screw driver, with all my 
weight, and a hell of a lot of grunts. Does that sound right to you all? 

I just want to make sure I am not screwing anything up, I still got to do the 
other door today.

Thanks all
