Subject: Dizzy stuck on total advance ?

Hey there volks,

Looks like my 79 FI 4spd (stock) is having a distributor problem. I
*believe* that I have the stock 205 dizzy.

I had thought that the problem was with the fuel injection system,
but we all know to check the other systems first to make sure they
are within spec.

Well, the dwell was at 50 degrees, but the timing was at 28 (WTF !?).
So I backed the timing down to 7.5 where it should be, and revved the
engine to see the advance kick in. No advance, stayed right on 7.5.

Next I popped the dist cap and pushed the &quot;pull rod&quot; for the vacuum
unit to get rid of the advance. Put the cap back on, started the
engine (timing is really off now), and when I increased the rpms, it
when back to 7.5 and stayed there. 

So I know that the dist. is stuck in the advanced position.

I checked the vacuum lines to the dist. and they seem fine. Sucked on
a hose to connected to the vacuum can on the dist. see if I could get
the advance to back off but it wouldn't. 

I'm at a lost at what to do next. Any pointers on what my options are
would be appreiciated. Do I need to rebuild the dizzy ? Can I buy a
rebuilt/new dizzy ? Can I drive the bus in its current condition ?

(oh... and I sold the dist. with the engine from my parts donor, so
swapping in a spare is not an option).

Thanks in advance,
