Subject: Re: [T2] Fried wire solenoid to alternator

Never go to bed while your bus has a &quot;burny smell&quot;.
The starter works. Leave it alone for now.
Later, you can research &quot;hot start&quot; in the archives.
 &gt;&quot;2 red wires running to a funny little plastic box
 &gt;hanging out to the left of the transmission&quot;. ???

The alternator has fried the output wire.
Trace this wire from the alternator to the solenoid.
The battery primary cable is also connected to the
solenoid at this same terminal, so it is essentially
a direct connection from the alternator to the battery.
Unfortunately, alternator diagnosis is not a novice
technology. Do this- Measure battery voltage, then
start the bus and measure it again running.
If you do not see an increase in voltage, the alternator
is not functioning. It is also important to know that the
alternator will not output if the dash idiot light is not
functional, as in it lights with the ignition in &quot;on&quot;
then goes out when the bus is running. It's likely cooked.
Since your alternator was installed 2000 miles back,
you may have a warranty issue with the shop.
Failing that, disconnect battery cables, then remove the
alternator (do not take the pulley off) and regulator and
have them bench tested at an alternator shop or a parts store.
You may not be able to determine wher the wire shorted now,
as it is cooked. Strong smell of defective installation?

&gt; the solenoid into the alternator.
