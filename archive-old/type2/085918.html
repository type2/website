Subject: Re: [T2] head temperature sensor

Hey Chuck,

How are you? I just finished some work on my van. No success yet. This is 
what I did today.

I installed a new head temperature sensor. I started the van and the same 
thing occured. It ran and then died shortly after. I next checked all vacuum 
connections. Everything seemed to be fine. No cracked hoses and everything 
seems to be connected properly. To confirm this I completely turned in 
(clockwise) the hex screw on the Air Flow Measurement box as you suggested. 
I started the van and the same thing happened. Absolutely no change. I 
returned the screw to its original position (2 and one quarter turns out) 
and tried the van again. Same thing happened. All battery connections are 
clean.

So what do you think? I don't know what to try next. Any advice?

Thanks,

Matt

I think that you have a major leak. Low level leaks would have to be 
numerous to cause such a condition on their own. I have had ground strap 
(battery to chassis) that caused all sort of weird symptoms. Just last month 
a rusty strap caused starting problems. As I wiggled it it would go too a 
few ohms. A big ugly NAPA strap fixed that problem. A poor strap from the 
tyranny to chassis can cause the clutch cable to fail I am told. Seems 
conduction through the cable causes metal migration problems.

Its hard to work in the cold.  Hunting for vacuum leaks has been a way of 
life for me and my 77.  I have to believe leaks are problematic in the older 
FI models.

You can adjust the Air Fuel Mix with the hex screw on top of the Air Flow 
Measurement box. Turn it clock wise until it hits bottom (count the turns). 
This is as rich a it can go. Hook up the sensor and see if it will run. This 
mixture adjust inter acts with the idle adjust screw so the idle will most 
likely be off. But if this lets it run with sensor hooked up it points to a 
vacuum leak.

In this case go to the Type2 search engine and type Vacuum leak for a wealth 
of info.

Good luck and let me know what you find.
Chuck

&gt;Chuck,
&gt;
&gt;Last fall I was driving and the bus just died out. It didn't sputter or run 
&gt;rough it just stop running. I pulled over took a look at the engine and 
&gt;seen nothing. It immediately started again and off I went. This continued 
&gt;happening. Not at an exact interval but consistently happening. It was 
&gt;usually around 10 or 15 minutes of driving. It was at the end of the year 
&gt;so I only drove a few times before I stored it for winter.
&gt;
&gt;I just took it out of storage and started it up and voila the new problem 
&gt;has come up. It starts, runs at high rpm(around 2000), and then dies after 
&gt;a minute. Everybody has been saying battery connections, vacuum tubes, or 
&gt;head temperature sensor.
&gt;
&gt;I have cleaned all battery connections but have yet to check the ground 
&gt;strap as someone mentioned. I have tested the sensor as I mentioned before 
&gt;and from what you were saying it seems to be working. I have not started to 
&gt;look for vacuum leaks but I do know that there is a big vacuum hose that 
&gt;has a loose fit. It's the one that goes to the deaccellerator valve I 
&gt;believe. It's connected but should be clamped. Would a loose fitting hose 
&gt;cause such a problem?
&gt;
&gt;It has been snowing up here for the last week so not the most pleasent 
&gt;weather to work in. Anyway I would like to get it running and tune it up 
&gt;for spring.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks alot for your help,
&gt;
&gt;Matt

&gt;You are not wrong the colder the temp the higher the resistance and the 
&gt;richer the fuel/air mix. What happened to start this problem off?

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thanks Chuck,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I live in Ottawa, ON, Canada and it was about 0 degrees celcius yesterday 
&gt;&gt;when I did the testing. Perhaps the cold temp is responsible for the high 
&gt;&gt;resistance before start up. I always thought it was the opposite though. 
&gt;&gt;That resistance decreased as temperature increased. Am I wrong? Anyway I 
&gt;&gt;will check all the vacuum hoses and get back to you with what I find.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Matt
