Hi all Tooers
Recent joiner. Just bought a very nice 83 Westy with what appears to be
a dropped seat. I have a good 76 2.0 engine with 40 DCNF carbs and
assume it will fit with the 83 tin but will need a new exhaust system at
a horrific price. No Smog check here in FL so could use aftermarket
stuff but what about heat exchanger match up? Also, what is the
consensus about the Webers? I have 2 complete FI systems and can go
either way.
I have researched the archives and library but found little re the
Webers. All advise appreciated. Thanks, Jack- Rover SD1, 1960 Gemini FJ.
