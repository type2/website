Subject: dash pod request

i wonder if anybody wants to sell or trade me a very neato 68 dash pod
(brake warning light in upper right corner)? my glass is 2/3 loose and i
suppose it won't be long before the weight and vibration of the speedo
brings the whole house down. i'd like to do it in concert with a steering
box changeout this spring - take the steering wheel off once.
 - steve
