Subject: Anyone in Portland OR?

I got offered a set of HE's for my bus, but they're setting in a
driveway in Portland, Oregon. The owner pmailed me that he had them
but he was out of town and can't send them to me himself.

&gt; I have a pair sitting in my driveway that I was going to toss because no one
&gt; wanted them. You can have them for free if you get them or have someone come
&gt; get them from my driveway in Portland Oregon. I am out of town right now and
&gt; cant be of any further assistance 

Anybody willing to pick them up and stick them in a box and ship them
to me? Pleeeeezeeeee?

(Of course I'll pay for shipping and a beer for your time.)
