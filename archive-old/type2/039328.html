Subject: Bizarre VW Bus Related Injuries #101.874

Well I just got the 6 staples removed from the top of my head after
becoming one with my '71 VW bus last week!  I had just finished replacing
the carb that I 'd rebuilt and was leaning down to adjust the jet when I
got the engine deck lid latch stuck in the top - o-me- head!  Boy did that
baby hurt and my barn floor still shows the evidence.  So now both the bus
and it's owner &quot;leave their mark!&quot;
My wife commented afterwards that I should probably wear a bicycle helmet
when I work on my bus from now on !

DSS with slight depression in top of head.
