Subject: Can someone take a photo for me...

I'm trying to reconstruct the rear passenger heater outlet on my '71 
westy but I don't know what it looks like.  The whole outlet has been 
plated over sometime in the past due to rust and I want to open it up 
again and get it working.  I've hacked off the repair to reveal the face 
of the floor section which has four  tabs on it.  I presume this is 
where some kind of face plate fixes, but I don't know what it looks like.

Can someone with a walkthrough take a close up shot of the plate for me 
please ?

thanks

Lee
