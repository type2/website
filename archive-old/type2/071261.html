&gt;  well, as i said i have over 65k on my rebuild, not to bad for a t1 pushing
&gt;  a heavy bus. It runs very cool, and is totally stock. I need to do the
&gt;  heads soon probably, and i expect to get at least another 40k after that
  
Supposedly heads should be done at 70,000 miles.  My last engine was going 
strong with twice that on it (original heads).  I pulled the engine because 
the transaxle failed with a total of 265,000 miles on it.  You say your 
engine runs &quot;very cool&quot;.  How do you know?
 
&gt;  My indicated 70 is probably closer to an actual 65-67 i have checked my
&gt;  speedo with a gps.
 
I think you do the list a disservice when you say you drive consistently at 
70 when you're not.  There are people who will read that and think that they 
can actually do that. 

&gt;  at 4100 rpm one
&gt;  will be going approximately 70 MPH.  I consider that a safe cruising rpm
&gt;  for a well built motor.
 
I agree, I often cruise at 65 or even faster, but I have a CHT gauge that's 
accurate and an oil temp gauge that's accurate.  So I know I'm not over 
heating my engine.  I also know that I'm safe almost all of the time at 55 to 
60.  Most people don't know how hot their engines are getting that's why 
they only get 70,000 miles on their engines.
    
&gt;  Also, i go 70 if i can maintian that with partial throttle, i rarely mash
&gt;  the pedal to the floor to maintain speed.
  
You should probably should have mentioned this important fact in your 
original post.
  
   
&gt;  It is my humble estimation that 4100 rpm will kill a motor much slower
&gt;  than heavy loads.  Push it hard, and you will kill it i agree.  But i dont
&gt;  believe speed to be a good indicator of how hard a motor is being pushed
&gt;  neccecarily. One can go 70 in some situations with little stress, in other
&gt;  situations trying ot maintain 55 will heat your motor up right quick.
  
Absolutely!  It's all about how hot the thing gets.  I drive by my temp 
gauges.

&gt;  I dont neccecarily expect this motor to go a real long time as it was my
&gt;  first t1 rebuild and i have made a few maintenance mistakes.  But i dont
&gt;  think my tendency to go 65-70 has accelerated things too terribly much.
  
It all depends on how hot it's getting.
