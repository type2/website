Subject: Re: [T2] Maintenance Logs

Zack,

I keep logs in all of my cars...one of those 3x5 sprial bound notebooks.

Since I never intend for them to get wet, I use whatever is handy at the 
time to write with.

If you are worried about getting it wet, then use a real &quot;old style&quot; ball 
point pen...or one of the new fangled ones that they claim can't be 
&quot;washed&quot; off of checks when you write them.

Very detailed...gas fill-ups, maintainence, new parts put on and 
occasionally, references to changes I make to try to get things running, 
better, cooler, etc.

Cheers, dave

 I am starting a maintenance log.
 Got a nice leatherbound travel journal that is the perfect size.
&gt; 
 What I want to know is pen or pencil?
&gt; Pencil doesn't smear or bleed when wet.  Pen lasts longer I think.
&gt; Pencil can be erased though and never runs out of ink....
&gt; 
&gt; How many of you keep logs?
 How detailed do you get?
&gt; 
&gt; Right now  I am looking at
&gt; Date Location Odo as my entry headings with details below.
