Subject: really really need a/c belt part #

Folks,

After looking at my new compressor, it has one groove that is &quot;thin&quot;
and probably fits the original a/c belt.

I looked for my original belt and can *not* find it.

Would someone please please look around on theirs for a
part number?

Thanks ,dave
