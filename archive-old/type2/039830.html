Subject: generator alternator swap Q's

Hi folks:

I found an alternator kit in Dallas on Sat.   Went out to Albany, TX, pulled 
the engine in a parking lot and did the install.  Everything went soothly.  
I ran into one problem, I have a 34-PICT-3 located in the center, and now 
the throttle assembly hits the side of the alternator so I can only get 
about 1/4 throttle.  Is there a kit to move that carb over a little?  Also, 
on the alternator tin, there are three pieces. a ring and two large disks.  
I put the ring on the end of the alternator and sandwiched the two disks 
together.  That leaves a small rectangular opening, should that go in on top 
or on bottom?

I decided to drive to Ft. Worth at quarter impulse, everything seemed to go 
smoothly, although it was a little slow. Anyway, about a mile from my 
friend's house, the engine temp sky rocketed.  The oil was at 255 F when I 
noticed it.  Apparently, a piece of paper towel got sucked into the fan.  
This happened within about mile, so hopefully no major damage.  I'll reset 
the valves tomorrow.

Helpful advice appreciated..


Brian
