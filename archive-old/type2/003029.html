Ok, fellow listers, after getting sticker shock at my FLABS, I thought I'd
defer to the grand wisdom of the list for suggestions.

I bought a '69 Westy about two weeks ago. Except for exhaust leaks (getting
fixed in about two weeks), and a small oil leak (a VW engine with a
leak...NAAAAH!), it runs great. Body however, definitely needs work.

Spent the morning running around to body shops. When I explained that I
would like to restore Suegro to his former glory, the response I got from
most was &quot;Why?&quot;. I promptly left these establishments.

Finally found one shop that does do restorations, and actually seems to
understand that it needs to be a daily driver, so I can't lose it for
months
at a time.

Rough estimate, just based on a cursory look at the van: $10,000-12,000.

While it doesn't seem outrageous, it will take some explaining to my wife.

These guys seem to be fairly honest, and even let me know that for a
restoration, they couldn't take it in until summer of 2000, with a target
completion (going in and out of the shop for various pieces of work) of
late
2001, or early 2002.

So, I'm wondering if I should take up welding, and where I would go to do
so. How much of an investment will I need to make in equipment if I want to
do this myself?

Does anyone have good sources for repair panels? I saw a Veng book over the
weekend that seemed to have all the panels I need, but the guy showing me
the book said he may not be able to get some of them. The prices were quite
reasonable.

I'm in the Boston area, so any tips, hints, leads you can lend would be
appreciated.

TIA!
