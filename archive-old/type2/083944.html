Subject: Those darn lights

List, 

Ok, I spent most of the day yesterday trying to figure out what was going on with my lights. I got some of the problems fixed but need help. I now have working headlights, rear lights, parking lights and FRONT turn signals. I can't get my back turn signals to work, or (here's the biggie) my brake lights. Somehow, while doing all that stuff I got my fuel guage to register again (yippee) but the whole lack of brake lights is keeping me off the road. Help!

Thanks all in advance!
