&gt;       Steve has some really good points here, but I feel I should throw in
&gt;my 2 cents. :)

Okay, I'll do the same.  :)

&gt;Steve says &quot;hold 2nd gear to 27-30&quot;.  I agree with 27, definitely NOT
&gt;30, though.

I take mine to 30 in 2nd quite often, and once in a while when I need
maximum acceleration (don't laugh!) I wind it up close to 35.

&gt;Then, he says to &quot;hold 3rd gear to 45-47&quot;.  I really disagree
&gt;with this point. eP  I hold 3rd to 42 at the MAX!!

My typical 3-4 shift point is around 45 for normal brisk acceleration.
Occasionally take it up to 50, and in the extreme have had it to 53 or so.

&gt;I think my engine would
&gt;blow at anything past 42(in 3rd).

What year bus do you have?  Maybe we are talking apples and oranges here.
Steve and I have '73 busses, which have different trans and final drive
ratios than earlier and later busses.  If your bus is earlier, your shift
points are probably normal.  If it's '72 or later, you are definately
babying it.

I agree completely with Steve - aircooleds need RPM to stay cool.  The
heavier your right foot is in it, the more RPM you need.  I wouldn't feel
comfortable giving it even 3/4 throttle without at least 3500RPM on the
tach, OTOH I do putter around town at 35-40 in 4th just barely breathing on
the gas (and keeping an eye on the temp gauges) because it saves fuel.
