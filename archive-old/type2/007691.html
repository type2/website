Hi All - Solve my mystery

I've never written before, here is my problem.  I completely rebuilt my '79 2.0 with Hydraulic lifters last summer.  I drove it for 2000 successful miles and then it started acting funny after about 50 miles on a road trip.  It was losing power and then coming to life again, after it did this a few times I pulled off the freeway and noticed smoke behind me.  I nearly s_at_&amp;$ my pants.  At the same time a terrible noise started and the engine would barely run.  I parked it and came back a few days later and towed it home.

I got it running pretty easily when I tried to start it, but the noise was still there. 

Thankfully the smoke was caused from leaky oil from the filler tube seal!

Now the engine runs well (I havn't tried more than 10 miles or so) but the noise is really loud.  It does it when first starting out until a higher rpms when i'm sure it disappears because it is too rapid.  It has rhythm, sounds like a horribly bad lifter (so I replaced them!) and sounds like it is coming from deep inside the crankcase.

Before the car started losing power on the freeway the was a knocking (predetonation, valves?) noise that got louder and louder - then the power loss.  The new noise sounds much louder and deeper than the old noise.

Here is what was done to the engine for the rebuild -

- Standard bearings - the crank and case were fine (says the machine shop)
- Used cam - my downfall???
- rebuilt heads w/ new exhaust valves
- brand new pistons and cylinders
- new cam bearings
- rebuilt rods
- cleaned out oil cooler
- all new gaskets of course!
- everything was steam cleaned and the tin was glass beaded and looks beautiful

I really don't want to send this car on its way, and I don't want to put another engine in it (I already spent $1200 on it)

The only shop I've taken it to says the cam gear may be loosening up at the rivets - but that the noise is definitely inside the crank case.

SOLVE MY MYSTERY!!!
