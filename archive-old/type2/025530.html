years back, i was at the marina with my grandfather (the original owner of
my 82 Vanagon Westfalia) when we watched a 60+ foot sailing yacht  miss its
berth and send its bowsprit directly into the right rear quarter-panel of
the van.   there was no structural damage done to the van, it just made a
mess of the fender and deformed the outer portion of the sliding door.  the
boat also pushed the van more than two feet to the left.  the captain of the
vessel offered my grandfather a huge amount of cash on the spot (from the
safe in his quarters), in exchange for no call to the insurance company.
my grandfather had a some sucky-suck body shop pull out the dents as best
they could and bond-o the fender into something like the original shape (he
pocketed the remaining $$$$).  they did a bad job on everything but the
sliding door.  i protested, but he said, &quot;As long as the overall mechanics
of this machine function well, I don't give a good goddamn how it looks
son.&quot;

well, it's mine now.  so onto the questions:

1. are the replacement body panels that are available (west coast metric,
bus depot, etc.) of high quality/worth purchasing new or should i have the
same piece cut off an unharmed junker?

2. what sort of cutting/welding work needs to be done (specifically if
anyone knows) and what qualifications should i look for in the person doing
it?

3. does anyone know where i could find an undamaged, rust-free Assuan Brown
(the prettiest color ever) sliding door?  if worst comes to worst, i'll
settle for a good door that's a different color.

thanks in advance
jason

ps-is it really true that there are only four 16&quot; synchro wheels left in the
whole world?  i'd been saving up for awhile and i'd been planning to sell
the 5 alloys that i'd purchased for mine
