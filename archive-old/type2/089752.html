Subject: Re: [T2] Sythetics, and air cooled engines

Sorry guys-- I can't seem to get this address to come up myself---even
though it is correct.
Search-- Motorcycle oils vs. Automotive Oils, and it will go to the
article--very interesting and some good info here.

Later

=A0=A0=A0=A0 Motorcycle Oils vs. Automotive Oils 
http://www.xs11_dot_com/stories/mcnoil94.html 
This is real good reading especially concerning air cooled engines and
oil--- 
It mentions the oil that I have been using in my 74 Westy as well as all
my air cooled and water buffaloes----Golden Spectro---a full multi
viscosity synthetic--- 
Check this out--it explains viscosity loss due to heat and mileage---and
shear values of the stuff you using. 
It'll change your mind about the stuff your using--- 
Later, 
Terry
