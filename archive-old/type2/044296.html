Subject: [T2] Type 4 engine ?'s

Engine: Type 4 pancake in a 72 bus with 32-36 carb.

Problem: Intake manifold boot going to # 3 cracked and leaking, letting
air into the mixture

Question: Would this cause the # 3 valves to be a LOT tighter than the
other valves?
                 Would this cause the engine not to idle during warm up
?
                  Are the boots for a dual port the same as for the set
up I have.

I believe the answer to be yes to all of the above but wanted the
conformation from the list, if not please correct me.
