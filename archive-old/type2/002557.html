A couple of years ago I scanned the Owners Manual and the Westfalia
Campmobile supplement that are original to our 1970 Campmobile, and sent the
scans to several List members.  And someone put them on a website.

I've had a couple of computer crashes since then, and no longer have a
record of the website, etc.

If anyone has that information, please post it to the List.

Thanks.....
