Subject: Testing a Fuel Injection harness??

Hi all:

I got a fuel injection harness to replace the one that was destroyed in an 
engine fire.  (Air-cooled Federal Vanagon.)  I figured I'd do some testing 
of the harness before going any further with it, but I'm stumped right at 
the get-go and I'm wondering if there's something here I don't understand.

I first tested the wire that connects to the ignition coil; a continuity 
tester (test light and a battery) attached to the wire's spade connector at 
one end and terminal 1 of the big black ECU connector (as indicated in the 
wiring diagram) at the other end lit up.  Cool!  It's a good wire.

I then went on to test the 4 fuel injection connectors and here's where I 
got stumped.  Looking at the wiring diagram, one of the two wires at each 
fuel injector connector runs to a terminal in the ECU connector and the 
other wire runs to the white plug that attaches to the right side of the 
dual relay.  In each case I registered continuity between one terminal of 
the connector and the appropriate terminal in the ECU connector.  But, when 
I went to do the test with the other wire in each of the fuel injection 
connectors I got no indication of continuity at the white dual relay plug.

The harness certainly *looks* OK and it's only an overabundance of caution 
that persuaded me to test it in the first place.  According to my reading of 
the wiring diagram I should be showing continuity between the FI connectors 
and the white dual relay plug, but I'm not.  Do I have a bad harness here, 
or am I missing something in my reading of the diagram?

TIA.
