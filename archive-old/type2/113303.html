Subject: Re: [T2] Pertonix Ignitor and 78 Bus

Hi Paul,

On the 1974 engine in my westfakia I had to trim the rotor to fit. 
There was no way on God's green earth it would have fit otherwise, it 
was already pressed all the way to the bottom of the shaft.

Perhaps David has a different distributor than what's in your bus. Or 
maybe just a different rotor.

Anyway, once that was taken care of the thing worked great.

Happy trails,

&gt; actually, go get yourself a new rotor and push the ring all the way 
&gt; down.
&gt; the guys at bill n steve's warned me of this when i bought mine.  you
&gt; really need to push hard to get it all the way on.  you might use a 
&gt; deep
&gt; socket to help press it on.

&gt;  Then I found the distributor rotor would not go on far
&gt; enough to engage the internal protrusion with the slot on the 
&gt; distributor.
&gt; The magnetic collar would not let it go down far enough.  -
