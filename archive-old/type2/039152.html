&gt; Diameter, radius what's the difference?

Well being the kooky math teacher that I am, here we go!
To put the definitions in simple terms the diameter is the distance across a
circle through the center.  The radius is the distance from the center to the
circle.  The plural of radius is radii.  A diameter is the same as two radii.
