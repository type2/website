Sorry if this in the archives but I couldn't find it.

I'm looking for advice on what is a good aftermarket-auxiliary oil cooler
for my 81 Vanagon and where is a good supply source.  Also, where would
be a good place to mount it?  I remember seeing an oil cooler with an
electric fan and it appears that this may be a good unit - anybody got
one on their van? 
	After all this talk about valve seats I have come to the
conclusion that if your head is cool you probably won't drop a seat. 
Therefore, since my van is a  westy and I may pull a small boat or carry
kayaks on the roof - I've decided to improve the cooling.
