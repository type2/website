&gt; when you test it in water it might read the correct temp

gauge
&gt;  is reading 300 actual temp 250,

This has been my experience also.  The only reason I recommend the boiling 
water test is that almost anyone can do it and it's inexpensive.  It also 
will give you one point to judge accuracy from which is better than no point. 
 And if your gauge is like the oil temp gauge in my '71 which reads 50 
degrees too low through out its range one point is all you need.  Also if 
more people did this simple test VDO would start getting their trashy gauges 
returned to them.  And who knows?  Maybe the quality would go up.
Personally I have a thermocouple thermometer that I calibrate my, and friends 
gauges with.  I just checked a CHT that cost the purchaser $100.00 that's a 
cheap gauge?  It was reading 400 when the actual temp was 330 and 600 when 
the actual temp was 500.  

So Ron, as someone that sells these things what is person to do?  Personally 
I think if VDO got a few complaints from their retailers they might do a 
better job.  I'm sure I can count on you to send one in because I know you 
are very ethical in your dealings with people.
