Subject: Gas heater

I recently have run across 2 heaters for sale for a very low price.  I 
talked the guy selling them and he didn't know tons abou them at all.  He 
said one came out of a vw bus and he wasn't exactly sure where the other one 
came out of but it was from the same time both are volkswagen.  I am 
thinking about going to look at them because he said both worked when he put 
them in storage a couple of years ago....

Could someone give me some tips on what i should look for before i buy them. 
Maybe a model number or serial number or brand name??  I am very unfamiliar 
with gas heaters.  He wants around 50 dollars for both.
