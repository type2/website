Holly and Chris Mills send:

&gt; Have her help you remove the engine some Saturday for anything - like
&gt; replacing a gasket or cleaning the fins and then tell her you think it
&gt; maybe related to the high rpms she insists driving at.
&gt; 
&gt; Make sure she busts plenty of her knuckles and gets filthy and followed but
&gt; completely tired out. Then causally mention how glad you are that you guys
&gt; don't have to open up the motor - that could cost thousands......
&gt; 
&gt; If she doesn't get the picture then I would force her to ride shotgun
&gt; forever. I mean, which is more important - your girlfriend's feelings or
&gt; your bus engine? Easy choice I think! &lt;grin&gt;

Well, it all depends on how good her job is...
