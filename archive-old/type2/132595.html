Hi Jason,

Depends on how committed you are to the &quot;head banger&quot; cabinet over the 
rear cargo area.

I used a pair of 4x9&quot; speakers installed into the cover that hides the 
hatch springs. They sound great, and you can always hear them 
regardless of how heavily loaded the westy gets. 4x9's may be a bit 
harder to find, but they are also a lot easier to find places to 
install into. IIRC mine are made by pioneer, and originally came out of 
an early 80's buick.

&gt; any suggestions on pre-fab speaker boxes for 6x9's that fit decently in
&gt; a Westy, and where did you mount them?
