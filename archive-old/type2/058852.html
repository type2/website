Subject: Slightly OTP: Resto Proj Mgmt Software?

This isn't specific to VWs but it would seem as relevant as POR-15. :-)

Now that I've got a couple of resto projects going at multiple
locations, I'm trying to get better organized.  What I'm looking for is
software that lest me:

- create a list of resto/repair tasks
- indicate task order, especially what must precede each task
- for each task, indicate required parts/supplies/etc, est time to
complete, and so forth
- for each part, maybe a part number, description, multiple vendor
prices (list vendor, contact info, price)
- generate PERT charts showing critical paths

I realize this is basically a database app, but the PERT charting and
task linking make it more of a PM topic.  I'm playing with a trial
version of Microsoft Project right now, which seems to do a lot of what
I'm looking for.  I realize I'm being a bit anal here, but anything less
doesn't really give me an improvement over my old paper and pencil
methods.

What do y'all use to track your repair/resto projects?

Thanks,
joe
