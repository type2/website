Subject: Re: Miles per gallon

  A.  What should I
&gt;expect as average gas mileage (2.0 litre engine)?  

I get 21.5 mpg (thats imperial gallons which are bigger than yours). This is
measured over about 2 years.

After my rebuild, I had all sorts of problems and I was down to 12 mpg,
until I got the carbs sorted. Don't know if you've got FI but on mine its
carbs. I had faulty chokes which closed up on the road, and also a vaccum
leak. If chokes are a problem - you can check by taking the air cleaner off
and seeing if the top flap is fully open after its warmed up, you just take
the external electrical unit off. Disconnecting the wire wont work. You
should be able to start up without them where you are.
