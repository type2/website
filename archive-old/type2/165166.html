Subject: Re: [T2] Building LEDs for Westy

Bob, are these LED taillights something you made
yourself with proprietary circuit boards, something
you purchased and adapted, modules you purchased and
mounted to fit, or LED replacement bulbs?

Do yours have all the LEDs on all the time with two
different resistance values for bright and normal or
two different intensities of LEDs?

If you used replacement &quot;bulbs&quot;, how many LEDs do they
use?

I'm about to replace all my interior lighting with
LEDs and have been experimenting with light output
intensity and spread. I will likely be combining
approx. 120 degree spread for general lighting with 5
to 8 degree spread for reading lights. I, too have to
get the engine back in and bus on road before much
more lighting exprimentation! 

After the interiors, I will likely make boards for
taillights, marker lights and turn signals. I'm
considering something really trick with that symbol we
aren't supposed to use - I wonder if I can stay out of
trouble with VW if I give them away and charge a ton
for &quot;shipping and handling?&quot; I s'pose I need to drop
that idea! Too many other things above it in priority
right now. -BaH

 I've got LED taillights in my 78, will be writing it
 up as soon as I get  the *#&amp;$!_at_ thing back on the    
        road, the heads went on  and engine went back
 in this morning, hopefully driving soon
