To: type2_at_bigkitty.azaccess_dot_com

I recall an interview with a professional auto thief (how do the TV
folks find these people?  Perhaps they place want ads?) wherein he
stated that the thing that gave him the most pause was an obviously
home-made alarm system installation.  

Professionally-installed systems were a piece of cake for him to
disable, but the unknowns presented by the amateur system caused him
to move on to the next vehicle.  His basic gist was &quot;It wasn't worth
it to find out if some nut case installed a tear gas canister with his
alarm system.&quot;

Perhaps I should install a kludgy aluminum control panel with key
switches labeled &quot;Alarm&quot;, &quot;Sarin&quot; and &quot;High Voltage&quot;!  :)
