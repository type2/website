Nice. I had one of those in the late 70s (looked alomost the same -- blue, 
with a big old welded bumper and winch on the front). The thing would go 
pretty much anywhere. I climbed over a mountain (literally) in the Canadian 
Rockies with it...but it wouldn't go through four feet of water. A little too 
deep!
