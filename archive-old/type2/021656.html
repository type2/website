&gt; hi art -
&gt; i'm a newbie westie owner (a 78) and was recently turned on to the AIRS
&gt; site.....
&gt; i just returned to north jersey after a trip around the great lakes and had
&gt; some engine trouble during the trip...SADLY, i wasn't aware of the airs site
&gt; until my return so i was towed to a dealer where i was royally SOAKED on
&gt; repairs......
&gt;
&gt; ANY HELP/SUGGESTIONS ARE GREATLY APPRECIATED!!!!
&gt;
&gt; the conditions:
&gt; ran the vw from trenton on the PA turnpike at 60-65 m.p.h. only making stops
&gt; to refuel.....got to ohio some 6-7 hours later and the engine started
&gt; &quot;lurching&quot; on hills....felt like compression problem/fuel
&gt; clog...pedal-to-the-metal gave me 40 m.p.h. at best and constant
&gt; lurching/loss o' power.....still ran, mind you, but something definitely not
&gt; right...made it to a rest area where i shut her down and then was unable to
&gt; restart....SOOOooooooo, i had a new starter installed along with an air-flow
&gt; meter......(mechanic's  diagnosis as to my problem).....
&gt; return trip through PA produced SAME engine trouble (no starter probs
&gt; though).......this time, however, i was close enough to my destination that
&gt; i just put the hazzards on a limped my way to trenton...i did notice,
&gt; however, that by adjusting the height of the accelerator i did get somewhat
&gt; &quot;smoother&quot; (still not right, though) power but still in the 40-45 m.p.h.
&gt; range.....
&gt; NOW  - after spending a few days in trenton without running it, i started on
&gt; my way back to my home outside of new york (about an hour &amp; 45 minutes
&gt; north)....figuring i'll just limp home or use my AAA plus for a tow...there
&gt; were ZERO problems...it ran fine - no lurching, no power problems - even on
&gt; hills.....
&gt; now:
&gt; i had been running the bus for a long time at higher speeds on hot days when
&gt; these problems occurred &lt;i know, not smart&gt; -  could this simply be a matter
&gt; of over-heating????? of gas evaporating before getting to the engine?
&gt; any suggestions/observations are GREATLY appreciated.......
&gt; thanks, kev
