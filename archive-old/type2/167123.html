Subject: RE: [T2] Petronix Electronic Ignition

I took a closer look at the inside surface of the magnetic sleeve.  It seems
there is an indented groove circled around the middle surface. I think these
grooves should line up with the lobes on the distributor shaft.  And the top
of the magnetic sleeve has a small lip.  It seems to me the lip prevents the
magnetic sleeve from moving too far down the distributor shaft?.  After
reading the instructions (again) Petronix suggest the bottom of the magnetic
sleeve should be level with the bottom of the ignitor module.  The bottom of
the magnetic sleeve appears to be 1/8 inch above the bottom of the ignitor
module.  Close.  I've attempted tapping a little encouragement onto the
magnetic sleeve hoping it might seat a little further.  No luck!Mike: Do you
recall how much material you shaved from your rotor? &gt; I don't know if it
holds true for the pertronix, but after I installed &gt; my compufire, I had to
trim down the rotor on my grinder. However, I &gt; would think that the pertronix
shouldn't have this problem because I &gt; think it fits around the cam lobes,
and not above them....&gt; &gt; Mike
