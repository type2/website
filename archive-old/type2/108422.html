Subject: Re: [T2] Distributor and vacuum advance

Corbett asked:
 The question I have is not related to the carb or the type of distributor to
 use, but it is related to vacuum advance. The 009 has always been spoken
 poorly of, but I am unsure why now. According to the Bentley manual the
 vacuum advance for most models, except 74, use a vacuum advance cutoff to
 stop the vacuum advance from working. The manual says&quot; Except in 4th gear,
 the vacuum advance is cut off whenever the air temperature is above 54
 degrees F. This means that the vacuum advance is only effective in 4th gear
 and temperatures below 54 degrees.&quot; Now, would this make it very similar to
 the dreaded 009?

 I guess I am not understanding fully what the fuss is all about with the 009
 and with the vacuum advance being so much better. I always thought that the
 vacuum advance was what helped with the low end take off and stop some of
 the sputtering cause by only having advance that was centrifugal? Can
 someone explain this a little more clearly for me?

The 74 dizzy is a dual vacuum unit distributor. It times at 10 degrees after because it has manifold vacuum
connected to the retard side. This gives you 16-18 degrees of retard timing.
As soon as you open the throttle, manifold vacuum drops close to zero. The spring in the vacuum unit overcomes
the low vacuum and you get an instant 16-18 degrees of advance. This brings your timing back to about 7.5
degrees before TDC.
