Subject: Re: &lt;FMBC&gt; Fw: [T2]  AIRS

any chance to help a fellow VWer...

i was able to help someone who was stranded near here a few weeks ago!
two guys from california had flown to NC (or was it SC?) and bought an
old splitty and were driving it back to CA. the pully snapped off and
they had to be towed to claremore, which is about 30 minutes from tulsa.
called my buddy pete, cuz he has lots of misc bus parts lyin around, and
he found one, i drove out to broken arrow to pick it up and drove it out
to the CA guys in claremore. one of them got a good laugh that day cuz it
just HAPPENED to be &quot;will rogers day&quot; and when i got there, they were
just getting ready to have a parade. neither one of them had ever even
heard of will rogers and couldnt get over the fact they were having a
parade for someone who had been dead since long before we were born... i
guess they dont teach american history out there in cal-i-for-ni-A... i
even tried some clues like &quot;america's son&quot; and &quot;rope tricks&quot; and &quot;i never
met a man i didn't like&quot;... MAN, what DO they teach kids in cali? anyway,
they said they dont teach about cowboys out there, just entertainers, and
i said, he was a MASSIVE entertainer in his day... can t believe they had
NEVER heard of him.

wavin and shakin my head at the silly, sunbaked people of the west coast,
lol,
