  Gotta be something better.

Hi Courtney,

That's exactly what I did.

It is a bit loud... It's kinda amusing because when you pass a biker  
their heads all turn looking for the bike. No backfires.

&lt;/Greg&gt;

&gt; Now THAT is simple!! I just happen to have a pair of Sportster  
&gt; mufflers too. Looks like he just reversed the exhaust manifolds so  
&gt; they pointed back instead of towards the front of the bus? He  
&gt; should have made the mufflers removable via the stock clamps too.  
&gt; Gotta talk to Greg, a fellow Canucklehead. :-) I wonder if it is  
&gt; loud or backfires when coasting or letting off of the gas?
&gt; Thanks Dean!
