I'm going to to wire a DC-&gt;AC inverter to my second battery and looking for 
suggestions on wattage.  Most likely used for fan, laptop, battery 
recharger, maybe a small boombox, etc. What size inverters have people used 
that is useful but not too taxing on the alternator or battery?  I see them 
pretty cheap on ebay- are there brands or characteristics to look out for?

For folks in the St.Louis area, the junkyard across from the Illinois side 
racetrack has a mid-'70s full length zbed (blue plaid in good shape), 
overhead cabinet and side closet, all in decent shape.

Thanks kindly
