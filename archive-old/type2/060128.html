Subject: newbie and happy I found you guys

Hi my name is Keith and I live in southern calif  in the beach  town called
San Clemente, I have owned a 71 bus for 18 years and find it to be the
ultimate surf mobile, I love my bus. in 1989 I installed a trans vair kit
which put a corvair 110 hp engine and trans and diff, bolts right in and
now drives like it should . 90 mph on the freeway if you want, and I can
fly up any moutain road with ease, this weekend I am entering a corvair
show in Palm Springs in the modified class of course, I am kinda a half
breed and have been excepted by the corvair group, hope I am welcome
here...If anyone is interested I am an expert in this conversion and the
kit is still availlable........talk to you later ....Keith
