Subject: [T2] running on

Friends,
My engine is running on after I shut it off. I checked the archives and the 
suggestions I found said that its either retarted timing or a problem with 
the idle cutoff. Im sure its not the timing, so I am wondering where I might 
find the idle cutoff. I also need to know if it is electrically operated or 
what?

My engine is a dual port 1600 and I use a 30 PICT 1 carburetor.

Thanks!!
