&gt; I would like to hear from others who have ordered from Bus Depot about how
&gt; long it took to receive their order.
&gt; I ordered a new canvas and seals 11 days ago and have not
&gt; received anything
&gt; as of yet.  Am I just being impatient or should I be concerned?
&gt; They have great prices and I have read many good reports, and
&gt; would like to order from them again, just want to make sure there is no
problem.


We generally say to allow 10 working days before you receive your part, if
you order standard ground service.  (Next-day or second-day service is
available at additional cost.)  Additional time may be required for
made-to-order items.  Our problem is one that I don't dare complain about
too loudly - we just get more orders in a day than we can handle sometimes!

Actual timeframe can vary from a few days up to the max, or even above it
once in a while when things get really bogged down.  We do our best to send
the orders out in the order they come in, as fast as we can move.  No lunch
breaks here during busy weeks!  If you're in a rush, order the rush service.
Depending on where you live, the additional cost may not be too much.
Next-day, Second-day, and Three-Day orders get sent right to the front of
the line when it comes to filling orders.

Right now delivery has been a bit slow, because two weeks ago I lost all of
my summer help who went back to school.  I have someone new starting
tomorrow, which should smooth things out. (Could still use one more
order-packer - any takers?)  Orders coming in right now are hitting that 10
day range, but I think in another week we'll actually be ahead of that, and
hopefully in another few weeks way ahead of that.  (Incidentally, Ed, your
order shipped yesterday and should be there in a few days.)
