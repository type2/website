Subject: Re: Upholstery

I had a 71 camper- ugh on the HOT IN SUMMER  COLD IN WINTER yellow
vinyl- We sewed our own covers from fine pile material- the rear cushion
is easy; the seatcover you can remove or just cover over with material
you can staple in place OR make it removable for washing as we did- sew
the cover to fit with about a 2&quot; overlap- the overlap we sewed into a
tube that had a nylon string threaded through it and tighted like a
noose after putting the cover on.  The seat must be removed if you want
to get around the brackets.
