&gt;&gt; Has anyone devised a nice, tidy way to hang up their front seatbelts?


&gt;I throw mine over my left shoulder, so it hangs over the back of the
seat.

Unless you're in a 73 Westy and there's someone you like sitting in the
jump-seat right behind you.  OUCH!!  On the other hand, if you don't
like them...
