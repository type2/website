&gt;So if someone could give me a slight tutorial I would appreciate it. I 
&gt;am currently about to purchase a 79 Westy...

The best advice I can give you is to get a copy of John Muir's Book &quot;How to 
Keep Your Volkswagen Alive...&quot; Not only does it come in very handy for 
repairs, but it does have a section on how to buy a VW, including testing of 
the sytems and the Karma of your potential new family member. You should be 
able to check it out of a library, but if you are set on purchasing an 
air-cooled VW, I consider it a must have.
