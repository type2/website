12.4, guess I need a little charge.

&gt;Are you using a FLAPS peg hook cheapy VOM

It's not a fluke 9,000,000 oscilloscope, but it's a GB (elec products manf) that has served me reliably as an alarm tech./electrican. 20.00.

&gt;Once you have ruled out the source of voltage as the cause (the battery), then do the voltage drop tests others have outlined to find the weakness that prevents you from getting the voltage to the pump.

It's 12.4 as far as the solenoid, but when it comes back from the ignition switch, I'm down to 8vdc.

(All of this presumes that the battery case and terminals are clean. If they are not, well, that's what kills batteries

Just replaced my battery cable and cleaned the posts.

I guess high resistance from the solenoid to the ignition switch and switch to coil. Seem like a lot of stuff gets supplied by this circuit. (coil, pump, ecu)
