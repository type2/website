Subject: [T2] I screwed up

I really really thought the early exhaust systems
were square, similar to the old ones.
 
Ooops. Ok, so it's 11pm here and I am planning
a trip to the junkyard at first light to get those
heat exchangers. I *really* hope they are there.
Figure this is a town of 15,000. They've gotta
be there, don't they? 

I have to go do the &quot;happy heater box dance&quot;.
