&gt; I'm thinking about taking the bus over to a tire place to have the front
&gt; tires rotated from one side to the other.  The tires are wearing on the

&gt; even out the wear.

If you have a spare you can do it yourself with the emergency jack.

&gt; I know about maintaining the rotational direction, but the tire place wants
&gt; to jack up the bus with a hydraulic floor jack.

Sounds like a big shop with fancy equipment!
 
&gt; Is there a safe spot to locate a floor jack in the front of the bus to lift
&gt; it (both tires off the ground together), or is this a recipe for disaster?

If you look at the frame you'll see places to put the jack in the middle but
it's not that safe if you ask me.

VW says to support the bus here:
