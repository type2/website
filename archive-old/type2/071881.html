Greetings---
    I've slowly been redoing my exhaust and heater (thanks Karl!), and am now
getting a pretty decent output of heat in my '77 Westfalia.  The defroster
pumps, but there's a distinct lack of heat from the front kick panel outlets,
and I suspect that the heat distributor thang is not working right (the dash
lever just doesn't feel right).  My Bentley doesn't say diddley about the
later bay heat set-up.  If anyone has gotten in there and dicked around with
one of these, and would like to share, let me know.  Thanks!

Matt Q.  '77 (with cold feet, and a brand new/old working clock!  (thanks
Martin)).
