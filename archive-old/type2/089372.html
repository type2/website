Subject: RE: [VB] June 9 Super Jam at Maple Grove (Pa.)-Finding eastern PA ACVWS lately.

I am wrestling with attending, but my bus will not be there. I won't
leave it in the parking lot (I've never been to a VW event here (only
when I dragged my NOVA), and the thefts lately in the west coast parking
lots are scaring me unless I'm showing it), and she's not ready to show,
as she only mechanically restored, unless they have an engine class for
stock correctness (even then, I'm only almost there, still running the
brosol while I rebuild the pict30-1 :) ). The 70 ghia vert is ALMOST
ready, I must do the dash wood grain and carpet.
SO, I am probably going to show the ghia, or chicken out and drive the
J33p_at_! Up there and just go.
Does anyone know (I'm cheap too!) if I can pay the 25 to show the ghia,
and bring someone in the Ghia, and NOT pay for them? That way I drive
avw there (yes!) and get in 5 bucks cheaper.

Are there going to be ANY restored to stock buses (or even nice
custom...) splitties there? I MIGHT be ready or finishing up for next
year...
I AM finding more ACVWS up here, a 63 lowered yellow and white standard
custom split was bought from Georgia, and a 57 beetle with a Judson,
this Judson was NEW, the owner paid $$$$$$$$$$ to the OG engineer that
took the castings from the shop when they closed!!! The serial is even
indexed by one! I also found a 50 beetle, that's driven often. Not many
splits, just bodies of ones (not many good parts...), eaten by our PA
sandblasters (road salt or Ca mixed with screenings, it nicks your paint
and then rusts it..)
