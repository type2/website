Okay, let us know what you find.

BTW,  is this a stock 1600 dual port engine?  If so, what happened to the
original carb?

How did you determine * before you added the new components*  that your
problem was with the condenser?

&gt; Bob:
&gt;
&gt; Your theory of a vacuum leak is interesting.  Here's some more background:
&gt;
&gt; When I installed the new carb, I only had to disconnect one intake
manifold,
&gt; and I chose the right-side manifold because I had the generator off to
&gt; change the oil pump.  The manifold did NOT have a gasket, so I made one
out
&gt; of some gasket material I had in the garage.  It didn't occur to me that I
&gt; should check the left-side manifold to see if there was a gasket or not.
&gt; Funny that this is the side of the engine that's not working.
&gt;
&gt; I will try your suggestion of spraying WD-40 around the base of the
&gt; left-side manifold when I get home tonight.
&gt;
&gt; Otherwise, I changed the distributor, spark plug wires (twice), and spark
&gt; plugs (I used Torque Master, the best spark plug on the planet, no
&gt; question), checked valve clearance, made sure a spark was jumping from the
&gt; distributor to all the spark plug wires, made sure the spark plug wires
were
&gt; all connected OK, ETC...ETC.
&gt;
&gt; I'll let you know what happens tomorrow.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
&gt; Jim

&gt;
&gt; after you remove the valve cover and check to make sure that your valves
are
&gt; adjusted correctly to .006,  and the valves on that side are not all
&gt; completely closed.  Check the intake manifold where it connects to the
head
&gt; on the left side.  Sounds like you have a vacuum leak.
&gt;
&gt; to verify it's leaking*sucking air* -- with the engine at idle spray some
&gt; WD-40 around the manifold &amp; carburetor connections, on each connection one
&gt; at a time.  If the engine changes speeds or speeds up at a particular
&gt; connection, you found your problem......
