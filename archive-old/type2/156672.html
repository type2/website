&gt; Hey George,
&gt;
&gt; Hmmm, something like that thought had crossed my mind; I just didn't know how
&gt; to describe it....
&gt;
&gt; Isn't chamber pressure relieved by the crank case vent (is what it's called?)
&gt; next to the distributor?

No, chamber pressure is between the piston and the head.  This pressure
escapes past the rings if the rings don't seal well.  A little of this
&quot;blow-by&quot; is OK and normal, and is easily taken care of by the natural
draft of the engine breather into the air cleaner.

If you get too much blow-by it can overwhelm the breather and force oil
vapor from the crankcase out through other openings.
