Subject: [T2] 914 tranny in a Bus?

Hi Folks,

Since I do a fair amount of highway driving, I was thinking about installing 
a custom low/high ratio 4-speed transmission or a custom 5-speed 
transmission in my Bus so I can pull decent highway speeds without winding 
out the engine too much.

Then I got to thinking (always dangerous)...

If the Type 4 engine really is the same unit that was used in the Porsche 
914, then wouldn't the 914 5-speed transmission be a perfect fit?  I realize 
that going to Porsche parts immediately doubles the price, but it might be 
something worth researching.

Thanks for any info.
