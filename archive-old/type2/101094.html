Subject: Re: Max RPM &amp; Cruisin rpm of a 1600 SP

&gt;From: Sglw_at_aol_dot_com

&gt;
&gt;I have just been reading 'without guesswork'.
&gt;To quote from the performance section, the max &amp; cruising spped of a 1970
&gt;type II with a 1600 cc engine is 68 mph at 4100 rpm
&gt;It also says that the fuel consumption should be 26.4 miles per US gallon!

I'm looking at the 1973 &quot;Without Guesswork&quot; at the doc project and it's
claiming 26.4 miles per Imperial gallon, 22.4 miles per US gallon.  (I
have mixed these up myself, recently.)  It mentions that the fuel
consumption is according to DIN 70 030 but doesn't explain what that is.
The 1969 &quot;Without Guesswork&quot; and the split-window Bentleys explain the
standard: &quot;measured consumption plus 10%, vehicle with half maximum load
at a constant 3/4 of maximum speed on level road&quot;.  This implies that
when they did the test, they got something like 24.9 mpg, but they were
only running at 51 mph.

&gt;I guess that I can sort of fell happy going on the interstate _at_ 4000 RPMm
&gt;but a lot of people sat 3500 RPM.  What is the correct answer?

In the '69 &quot;Without Guesswork&quot; they list 3300 for a 36 hp and 3600 for
a 40 hp.  They list 3800 and 4000 for the various 1500 engines.  I think
the 3600 probably comes from two things: a hold-over from the 40 hp, and
a desire to trade top speed for longer engine life.
