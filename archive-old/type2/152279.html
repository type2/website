&gt; In '77 (and probably some other years) the California version (which is

but how many buses are &quot;stock&quot; anymore.  since the rotors were
interchangable it is possible you have one.   I would still look and check

&gt; grabbed the coil as well. Turns out, the '75 uses a 012 distributor, and
&gt; the 77 Cali uses a 093. Oh well.

yeah one thing I have found is getting the right distributor is rather
important
