Subject: Re: [T2] engine cutting out when I put in reverse

Sounds like you did the correct thing.  You have to be careful not to get
the ignition hot wire on the same terminal as the points wire, or you will
get no start and smoke pouring out of the distributor as the points wire
fries!  The hookup is ignition hot, backup lights, auto choke, and
anti-dieseling solenoid on one side of the coil and the points all by
themselves on the other.

&gt; Hey guys,
&gt;         You are going to laugh when you hear what I did. I went in windows
&gt; paint on my computer and made up this long drawn out diagram to see if you
&gt; guys could help me figure out the right wires to change and what not. So
&gt; anyway I diagram out the postive side of the coil and then I go outside to
&gt; sketch the negative so i can draw it on the computer. Anyway as I am out
&gt; there and I switch one of the wires from negative to positive like you all
&gt; said and it worked, no stalling now......So I did all that work diagraming
&gt; it out and then I fixed it...Go figure...Right? Thanks so much you guys....I
&gt; have one more question though there is a wire coming from the wire condiut
&gt; that holds on of the wires from the postive side of my coil(i think the wire
&gt; for the ingnitions switch) Anyway this wire goes to a terminal set into the
&gt; engine tin a bit and is right behind the distributer? What is this wire
&gt; Because it starts up with out it being hooked up and runs ok...I am curious
&gt; please let me know what you guys think...Thanks again for the help this
&gt; mailing list is the Best.......
