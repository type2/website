[Crick, Bill ]  Just another comment on driving in snow that someone else
made.
Watchout for SUVs. They have 4 wheel drive, and can go like hell! However
they
have two wheel steering like the rest of us, and we all have 4 wheel brakes.

A lot of SUV drivers don't realize this, and feel quite invincible until
just before they
smash into you ,or fly off the road.

Obligatory bus content. You syncro drivers remember this;-)

89 Cressida - big engine - autotmagic transmission - rear wheel drive
 - bad tires - no emergency brake  -&gt; The perfect winter car;-) Wheeeeee!!!
