Subject: Re: [T2] ADMINS: downtime (Backup list started)

I took the liberty of starting a backup list for
when our server is down.  It is intended to be
used only when the main list is down.  Join if
you want to be able to stay in touch while the
list is down.  It is public access.  There are no
controls over who joins or posts.  Vanagon_dot_com
list had one of these and it served us well.
