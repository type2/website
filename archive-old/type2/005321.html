&gt;Dexron ATF.  Run it for maybe 4-5 15 minute idle runs sitting while cooling
&gt;a half hour in between.  Drain and fill with new oil (NEVER Quaker State on


An error, actually I meant to say idle-2500 rpm oscillating it about for the
15 minutes, 15 minute drives without much stop and go on the mostly level
without much load keeping the engine in this range would be quite acceptable
as well, again watching oil pressure carefully.  Want to keep it off of idle
a bit where the oil pressure is low, probably more in the 1500-2500 rpm
range most of the time.
