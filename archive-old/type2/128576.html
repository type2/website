Subject: buying parts .....

Hi ...
I just picked up a 65 beetle...6 volt system...I will be restoring it over 
time ...where is a good place to get parts ...not sure what I need yet but I 
will be needing ...I have a 80 westy that I buy parts for from the bus 
depot...but I'm going to need a good source for the 65 bug...it has the crank in sun 
roof ..I know I will be needing a couple of misc. pieces for that ...I'm going to 
replace the floor pans...heat exchanger tunnels...and I think the door posts 
...it sounds like a rust bucket but it's really not ...it seems to be a pretty 
solid car...it's all there...I think with a little TLC I'll get it to run 
...motor turns freely ...I did have it turning over but I dont think I'm geting 
any spark ...anyway ...any help on parts places will be deeply appreciated...
thanks  ...
Jim~
