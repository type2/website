Just an anonymous line to alert transporter fanatics that Olston's auto salvage in 
Lincoln, Nebraska has a running 1970 single cab pickup for sale.  The tel. # is 
1-800-223-7020
They have a website and a photo that you can view right now.

They also have a rolled V6 Passat they are selling or parting out.  Project, anyone?

I really like to keep these vehicles in the lists.  Mine is the Vanagon list.  Let me know if 
anyone ultimately ends up with this truck.
