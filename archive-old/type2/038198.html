Content-Disposition: inline

I installed another similar looking dual carb fuel pump from one of my boxes and
voila the bus started and ran for a few minutes. The heater boxes from the black
lagoon were smoking, the motor was hunting, shaking and backfiring a bit, but
sounded like it might have pretty good compression. I have to figure out the
proper timing and get it there, make sure I'm not running any vacuum leaks, make
sure the point are right etc., unfortunately the fuel pump I swapped in has one
of those real dangerous loose brass fittings. I loctited it before installation
but the gas probably dissolved the loctite before it had a chance to dry, and
anyway, it's leaking gas. Once I get the thing to idle smoothly, I can turn my
attention to the brakes - first problem is the pedal is stiff and if I press it
I think I might lock the wheels up again. Still no ticket - unbelieveable.

So here is the timing question: What should my advance be if I'm running an 1800
AW code motor, with a (1974, 1976-1978) &quot;california&quot; distributor #0 231 170 093?
(there's only one port on the biscuit)   My guess is 5 degrees after tdc, as i
have a manual tranmission. Anyone want to throw their .02 into the game?
