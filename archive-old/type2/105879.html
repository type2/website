Subject: EveryBus 2003 Campout in NC (more info)

Can someone please fwd this to the vintagebus list.

EveryBus 2003 is just days away. The annual VW bus/transporter 
camping event is held in Pleasant Garden, NC. If you have not heard 
of the event and live within a half days drive please consider 
attending. You will not be sorry :)

So far there are folks coming from as far away as Canada, Oklahoma, 
Oregon and Florida and all points in between.

The full details of EveryBus are located at www.everybus_dot_com.

If you are planning on coming please note the following.

There is now a carabus list on the EB web site for planning you 
travels with others.

If you are one of the many bringing bus and camping related door 
prizes you can drop them off at the registration table.

If you arrive after dark as many will, the gates to the park are 
closed but not locked. Please let yourself in and close the gate 
behind you.

The will be a chilli cook-off as well as a side dish cook-off. After 
the judging the entries will be consumed as part of the traditional 
Saturday night potluck dinner. If you do not want enter the contest 
please consider bringing something to the pot luck. Plates, napkins, 
knives, forks, condiments etc as always welcome additions to the pot 
luck as well as food!

I have not had the time to formalize activities for the kids but if 
any of the parents want to volunteer to get something going please do 
not be shy about it.

If you have any questions just e-mail me.

Thanks
Chris
