&gt;It's not a reliablity issue with us bus owners, is it? 

I know a baited hook when I see it, but I'm one game fish.

There probably ain't a class of folks that can be labeled &quot;us bus 
owners.&quot; Don't know how may classes there are, but a single class doesn't 
describe us.

For some of us, a bus is a tool. We have chosen this tool, rather than 
another, because it does the job well and it feels good in our hands. 
It's like a set of old Stanley planes. We keep the soles of our planes 
true, and we carefully sharpen the blades so that when it comes time to 
do some work, the tool glides across the surface.

Having a bus in the best possible operating condition is like using a 
well-tuned Stanley plane. Taking a trip without concern that the bus 
might strand you is like planing an eight-foot board and having the 
shaving come off in one long, paper-thing curl.

But such joys are a matter of taste, and taste is not universal.
