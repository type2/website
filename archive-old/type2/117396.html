&gt; &gt; I'll be right behind him,  never got your CD cuz I use Linux and it
&gt; &gt; wouldn't run on my machine...but if it is ever ported to something generic
&gt; &gt; like PDF or html I'll take one.....
&gt; 
&gt; The CD *was* PDF specifically because the only way to do it which would run
&gt; on (and be searchable in) Linux, MacOS and Windoze, it was distributed in
&gt; hybrid HFS/ISO9660 format so all three platforms could read it, and
&gt; furthermore it included Acrobat Reader installers for all three platforms.

?????  Ok I believe but there was some reason I wasn't able to read it,
but sure am kicking myself now for not just picking it up and hopeing to
figure out how to read it later,  like now.......should know better with
these old buses you grab stuff when you can....

&gt; Surely I have many sins to answer for and I will probably end up in Hell but
&gt; it won't be because I am not scrupulous WRT cross-platform issues. =^ )

Mea culpa, Mea culpa, Mea Maxima culpa.......
