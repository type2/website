Well Volks;

It's been an interesting couple of days.  When we last corresponded, I
was trying to get the oil pressure warning light to function prior to
the initial firing.  As a refresher here are the particulars:

1600 DP
New Engine case
new crank
new camshaft
Modified for a full flow oil filter
Gene Berg pump cover
Aeroquip lines
balanced
VDO oil pressure gauge with dual sender
VDO oil temperature gauge mounted in sump
The bus has not had an engine for ~8years.
~1.5 years rebuilding the engine(been real busy)

As of my last request for help I was trying to build oil pressure by
cranking the engine with the coil ground wire disconnected.  The oil
pressure gauge would never top about 6-8 psi (cold w/ 10W-40, ambient
temps= low 70's).

I determined that the oil pressure light bulb was burned out.  Swapped
it with the blinker light bulb for now.

NOW I'm getting no oil pressure reading on the gauge and the oil
pressure light will not go out after 40 seconds of cranking (that's all
the battery will sustain right now even jumped to the truck).  SO, I
drained the oil and removed the sump strainer looking for a blockage.
None.  I removed the plug for the pressure relief valve (rear one) and
while I couldn't get it out, it was not stuck down. Next I removed the
oil filter, filled oil and cranked by hand looking for oil entering the
oil filter. None.  I have now removed the cover of the oil pump.
Everything seems in order.

What else can/should I check?  Is it time to pull the engine and tear it
down?  What else could cause this problem?

Please Help.  I'm just about at my wits end.

I do appreciate the replies I've received in the past week.  I never
would have attempted this without the list's help.  Now if I can just...
reach ...the.... bat pump..

Thanks
