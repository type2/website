Subject: [T2] cheap replacement muffler

Hey Mike, I just replaced my entire exhaust system with two components that
a local VW mechanic recommended.  The exhaust header pipes are made by
Pertronix, INC of CA (same as makes electronic ignition) and the muffler is
Thunderbird.  The thunderbird muffler has a welded bracket that attaches to
one of the bolts or the stud on the right heaterbox head, making a perfect
fit, and no need for fabricating some sort of bracket to hold it in place.
It sounds great, was about $40, and is made in AZ USA.  This system works
great, but realize that the paint is meant to burn off!  You can repaint w/
grill paint or other high-temp product.

Good luck, Nik
