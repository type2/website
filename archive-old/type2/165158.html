Subject: Re: [T2] lincoln welder comparison.

&lt;&lt;It no good for much more than 16 ga. sheet metal,and that'll be for
not much more than stitch or spot welding. 
well if you take your time it does much heavier work, I've done decent
frame welding slow&gt;&gt;

KInda like a Type 2 Bus into a headwind---

If ya have a lot of time on your hands, it'll get the job done.

I get it.

Welding 1/8 inch plate with a 110 welder would be like watching STP flow
at -50 below.

&lt;&lt;You can give a guy with 50 years experience one of the 110v Lowe's,
Home Depot consumer low duty cycle welder's and he'll lay beads that
looks like pigeon droppings on a bridge beam . 
I've seen proof otherwise (not me) when all you have is 110v you use
what you have.&gt;&gt;

Right.

A $19.95 carbon arc will weld sheet metal, and plate together too.

Stick welding will get the job done OK too.

So will a torch using coat hanger's.

I've seen proof of it, and I do it well.

I just made a decision years ago to break loose from prehistoric
methods, wanted to save some time, and be able to get any job done in a
quarter of the time, with a quarter of the movement.

I didn't want to be working within the limitations of the cord outa the
outlet, and the stinger cord.

If you are into wall hugging, and pigeon poop welds--the Home Depot
welder is the ticket to ride--no doubt--go for it.

The plastic feed roller's stink.


I, myself, went for a 100% duty cycle Miller M 30-E that I can crank
down to get sheet metal fused, and not have to run in the WFO mode way
beyond it's capacity, to get heavier plate done right with the correct
penetration the first pass.

The Miller can run 035 or 045 wire day in and day out, at 200 amps
without taking a nap every 20 minutes.

My suggestion would be is that if anyone is looking to buy a half assed
decent mig welder, take a good hard look at more than you need.

You'll never want more later down the road once you become proficient in
welding.

If your looking for a short duty cycle welder, I've got a 60% SAM
automatic amperage , stitch, spot, weld, welder on a factory roll cart
for sale.

It automatically reads the amperage required to get the metal welded.

Turn it on, select the job--weld, stitch or tack, and go.

I parked it maybe 10 years ago, and it does what it's supposed to do
very well.
It's in perfect shape.

I just got tired of waiting for it to cool down between it's duty
cycles.

I paid $2300.00 for it--I'll sell it for $900.00.

The Buzz Box, and Carbon Arc I'm keeping for laughs.
