&gt; With 30psi compression I doubt there is a gross error such as a valve

&gt; barrel-sealing-against-the-head problem.

&gt; I recommend the standard oil-squirt test to determine whether it's rings
&gt; or valves/barrels.

right don't think it is gross or I would have seen it when I did a visual
check, and this cyl was 125+ using the older head that was removed, this
cyl was not the problem, so I don't think it is a ring. rings were checked
when I had the heads off.
