You said gasket- there are 2 gaskets needed, one on each side of the oil
screen bottom lip!  I assemble it all together (gasket, screen, gasket,
plate, hold it carefully and slip it in untile the bolt sticks out, then
put on the nut.

&gt;      Yesterday I did my first oil change on my 79 Westy. I drained the oil and
&gt; removed the oil screen. The screen itself looked pretty clean, but the cap had
&gt; all sorts of grunge in it. Anyway, I cleaned the screen, cap, gasket , nut and
&gt; put it all back together ensuring not to over-tighten the nut. Tight and just a
&gt; little tighter. I also tried to make sure that that gasket was lining up
&gt; properly, and it appeared to be so. Now it is leaking oil from that seal.
