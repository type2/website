Subject: Re: [T2] need update on cheap caliper question

Mark,

You owe me!!!!

On Friday Jan 7th I sent....

============================================

Somewhere along the line you have spent way more time and energy on making 
the measurement than it was worth!&lt;big grin&gt;

I'm willing to wager a 6 pack of the finest German beer that your $19.95 
caliper is gonna be within 3 thousandths over three inches compared to the 
other &quot;serious&quot; measuring devices.....but if you win, you have to come to 
Arkansas to pick it up!

=======================================================

Soooo, when can I get my six pack!!!...LOL!

Cheers, dave
