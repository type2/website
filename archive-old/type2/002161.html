Not the toy.

Strange occurance No. 37:
Last summer I was towing my bus through the wilds of Georgia (long story)
when a guy in a station wagon pulled alongside and said &quot;you got a flat
there buddy.&quot; By the time I got it pulled over, there was nothing left of
the tire and the rim was so hot it was smoking. All the paint had burned off
and I thought the wheel would start the grass on fire. Luckily, it didn't.
Put on the spare and proceeded home slowly, about 50 mph, for 250 miles.

Fast forward to last weekend.

I had a big, bad leak in the wheel cylinder of the hot wheel. Took it all
apart to discover I had NO linings on my brake shoes whatsoever. Just black
crumbly stuff all over the inside of the drum. Very messy, very scary.
Bought a new cylinder, brake shoes, put it all back together.

Fast forward to today. Driving the bus I smell something like toasting brake
shoes. Put my hand on the suspect wheel and it is HOT, as in can't hold your
hand on it for more than a second or two. Other three wheels are cool after
driving the same distance. I jacked up the bus and made sure the new shoes
weren't dragging, which they weren't.

Question: Could this be a bad bearing? I noticed an eensy (technical term)
bit of play in the wheel while jacked up, but no &quot;ballsy rumbling sound&quot; (to
quote Muir) at all. Is my wheel possessed?
