Subject: z-bed dimentions

hey all,
	I finally scored an interior for my bus :) One thing that was
missing in the set was the board/cushion for the back of the seat (the
part that moves to a vertical position when upright). Could I get
someone to give me general dimentions for this piece of wood? It is a
full-width bed from a 74 interior. Width is obviously a no-brainer but
height is a little unsure. TIA.
