Marcus-
The secret trick to removing a FI connector is to
use a small screwdriver or dental probe to relieve
the &quot;bail&quot; wire. After many uses, these connectors
do just pull off, because they lose their &quot;bite&quot;.
Many curious FI problems are caused by poor
wire connections, so be sure to pull on the connector
and not the wires.
