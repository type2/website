&gt;
&gt;So my question: Can I assume this is a bad master cylinder,

You definitly have a bad master cyl. You fixed the damage but not what caused it. If you let the brake fluid fill the booster up to the level of the valves in it, you will destroy that booster also. Renew the master cylinder and GET the brake fluid out of the booster. 

 or does fluid 
&gt;disappear into the servo (I'm assuming that's where it went) if the 'O' ring 
&gt;isn't replaced or for other reasons, for instance could I have a major clog 
&gt;in the lines running to the back? Should I suspect the lines or master 
&gt;cylinder for this? By the way, no more stalling, van brakes well, but the 
&gt;fluid keeps disappearing.
&gt;
&gt;Any advice or comments appreciated.
&gt;
