Subject: heater cables

     OK.  I am stumped.  I need to change my heater cables.  I have
everything unhooked both at the heater control boxes &amp; the dash levers.  I
have the bottom pan off &amp; I am trying to pull the cables out of the tube
that runs under the bus.  No luck.  I can't pull hard enough to get the
cables to budge.  There is a little crimp on one fo the tubes but I think it
is just from where it bends to go to the heater box.  I am about to use a
come-along to try &amp; free them up.  Any ideas?  Thanks.
