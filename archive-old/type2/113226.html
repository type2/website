Subject: Rubber Engine Mounts

I'm looking at the rubber engine mounts on my 75 bus and the rubber's torn a 
little on one, and both top bolts aren't connected to the rubber portion on 
the engine side.  Is this a &quot;super glue&quot; job, or should i invest in some new 
mounts?  Where's the best place to get new ones?
