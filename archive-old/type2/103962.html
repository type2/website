Subject: Re: [T2] Aftermarket Pull starter?

I distinctly remember an aftermarket kit available in the 70's that
attached a rope pulley to the generator pulley and you were supposed to
be able to crank a bug by hand by wrapping the rope and pulling (like an
old lawn mower).  I often considered it because my 63 bug had a worn out
starter bushing in the tranny (unbeknownst to me at the time) but I was
too young to have enough strength to pull the rope!  I don't see how
this would work on a bus though since you don't have the side area from
which to pull like a bug does.  greg
