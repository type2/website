Subject: Re: '72 With Weber 32/36 (continued)

-&gt;Does anybody out there in the entire world have a bus with a Weber 32/36
-&gt;that really does run *CORRECTLY*?
-&gt;

I had a type IV (1800) bus with a weber and a vacuum advance dizzy.  I did
till the bus was rear-ended.  It took quite a bit of fiddling, but a lot of
that fiddling was a learning curve of trying to figure out how to use tools,
and do tune ups.... 

But the day I figured it out, I was so excited I made Amelia (my wife) run
out and drive the bus.  Good idle, nice transition to operating speed, good
power, no flat spots.  All that good stuff.

I was using a vacuum advance dizzy, the retard port plugged, and the vacumm
advance fed from the weber.  And the standard line... I also believe that
everything else was finally spot on all at once.  Valves, timing, point gap,
etc.  

So yes, they can run correctly.  That was a year ago.  I've got a set of
dual solex's on my new bus.  Same type of leaning curve (mechanics is not a
natural thing for me), on the balancing and what not.  But when they are on,
whoooo watch that bus fly:)

good luck.
