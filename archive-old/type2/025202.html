List,
Couldn't find this in the archives, so i figured i'd ask...
Just got a 74' that has been sitting with -some- gas in the tank with the cap on and everything sealed for about 3, maybe 4 years.  Needless to say, the carb was all gummed up and when i pulled the line off the tank, the gas was all dark and smelly like it gets when it breaks down.  
First of all, i know i should pull the tank to have it dipped and probably will later.  For right now, a friend told me deisel fuel is a pretty good solvent for getting that old gas out. Cuss/discuss?
TIA,
