Subject: Re: [T2] wiring question

[...]
only wire i can think of in that position would be for the water pump 
and the fridge.  If it a heavier gauge wire with another thinner wire 
that is probably what it is from.

&gt;     hello everyone,
&gt;
&gt;     I just had a quick wiring question re: my 79 westy. I just took all 
&gt; the
&gt; camping equipment out to remove some interior rust, and I noticed under 
&gt; the
&gt; main cupboard under the sink, a wire had been cut. It's a main wire that
&gt; runs from the fuse box, under the front carpets, through the drivers 
&gt; seat,
&gt; and out through the back and underneath the cupboard. The wire was just 
&gt; cut
&gt; and hanging there, so i'm not sure what purpose it serves. Is it the 
&gt; rear
&gt; back up lights? That's the only thing I can think of that isn't working 
&gt; in
&gt; my electrical system.
