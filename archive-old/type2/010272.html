&gt; A question about stoves/cookers  (it's purely
&gt; academic at present)
&gt; 
&gt; It occurs to me that it ought to be possible to fit
&gt; one of those Coleman
&gt; (unleaded) petrol fired camping stoves into a 'bus.

Yep, that's what I use in my '69 Westy.
&gt;   
&gt; Is this safe ?  Is it a good idea ?  Has anyone
&gt; tried it ?  

I have a double-burner Coleman that is dual-fuel
(i.e., it can run on unleaded gasoline as well as
camping fuel), but I've only used camping fuel in it.
Camping fuel has no odor when it burns and I smell
burnt gas(oline) (petrol for you non-Americans!)
enough just *driving* my bus.

I've had no problems using mine, but I only use it
outside for obvious safety reasons (that and the bus
is never parked level...kinda hard to keep the pans
from sliding off the stove ;-), but if it were
raining, I would have no qualms about using it inside
the bus or my tent.

I also have a single-burner &quot;Olympus&quot; backpacking
stove that I use for making coffee. It lights faster,
takes no time to set-up/break-down and it actually
boils water *faster* than my Coleman....go figure.

&gt; 
&gt; Yes, I know this subject is covered in the archives,
&gt; but I'm confused by
&gt; some transatlantic language problems...specifically
&gt; when the term 'Gas' is
&gt; used does it mean 'Petrol (UK)/Gasoline (US)' or
&gt; Butane perhaps, or Propane
&gt; or something else like LPG or Methane or whatever...

I'd never really thought about it before, but I guess
that *is* a bit confusing! We pretty much call
everything gas: butane, methane, propane, gas(oline),
etc. 

Larger stoves (generally) use either propane (LPG), or
camp-fuel...which is also called &quot;white&quot; gas, further
confusing the issue.

Smaller stoves (like my backpacking stove, which is a
self-contained cannister roughly 6&quot;Hx4&quot;Dia. when
closed), usually run on camp-fuel (like mine), or
butane cannisters. My stove came with instructions
saying that in Europe, camp-fuel is pretty much
non-existant and to use unleaded gasoline....it also
said to NEVER use unleaded outside of Europe....what
do you guys do to your unleaded, anyway???

Also, while my &quot;Olympus&quot; stove says *not* to use
American unleaded, my &quot;Coleman&quot; says it's *okay* to
use it, but it's not preferred. I find this confusing,
as they are essentially the same type of stove, just
that one is (much) smaller.
