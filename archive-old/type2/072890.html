&gt;If you rheostat on your original switch goes bad you can reroute 58b to 58
&gt;and will have power to the dash pod lights and bypass the scratchy
&gt;rhoestate(fire hazzard)
&gt;
&gt;Good luck

Cool! Might give that a shot... I also had a switch that had NO rheostat; a
buddy soldered a resistor across two of the spades, which gave me light,
but at one setting only. You could set the brightness/dimness of the lights
by changing the value of the resistor to your liking. I'll see if I can dig
it up, find out which tabs and what value I had on mine.
