Subject: Re: heater boxes

&gt; hey all,
&gt; is there some trick to getting the nuts off of the #3 and #1 exhaust
&gt; studs?  I want to change my heater boxes...I've been soaking the nuts in
&gt; penetrating oil and have gotten 2 off so far.  The bottom ones.  Now for
&gt; the top ones.... is there a special tool? sheer brute force? or should I
&gt; yoink the motor and replace my clutch while the derned thing is out...

I think the best thing you can so is soak the nuts with penetrating oil
for a week or so, then pull the engine and pray you will be able to
loose the nuts with out breaking the thread. So far it has happened
twice to me that it broke. This is really bad, fortunately the other nut
would go off normally but it still isn't a perfect condition to have the
tube attached with only one nut.

I have never replaced the heater boxes with the engine in the car.
