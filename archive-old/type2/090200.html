Sherri (and everyone else),

I dug around a bit and found a series of pictures I took for this article
that never got imcorporated.  The page that you see covers taking the rear
support/hinge off the bus.  I also took a bunch of pics of the
disassembly, cleaning and reassebly of the hinge block.  I have put the
pics at:
http://www.everybus_dot_com/dworkin/rearhinge/
There is no text, alas, but ask questions and I will do my best to answer.
The pictures that start with &quot;P1010nnn.JPG are the raw pics and are huge!
the named files have been editied and resized and may well be more useful,
thjo I did not get all the pictures edited by any means and there are some
gems hiding in the huge files, alas.
