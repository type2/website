&gt; Did it run hot with such high compression? Cam specs are somewhere?
&gt; Maybe I've got the spec in one of my books. Stock heads configuration
&gt; with big valves?

yeah always ran a bit hot, sometimes a whole lot hot, had a heck of a time
keeping it cool, wasn't designed to get on the autobahn at 100mph for
hours

this was a lot of years ago.  what I really remember about the thing was
how hard it was to sync the _at_#(%&amp;#!_at_ carbs.  that and it wouldn't run in
the rain with unleaded gas, never have figured out that part??  used to
use the Sunoco 280 gas...

&gt; Is this the engine characteristics the engine builders are trying to
&gt; emulate today (besides the compression ratio)?

have no idea I got out of racing a long time ago, I sold the engine
(Broken) for enough $$$ to pay a full semester at college.  when it ran it
was a firebomb, and when it didn't it was a HUGE PITA

&gt; VERY interesting stuff.

yeah, was interesting in hind sight, you couldn't give it to me today,
have gotten lazy, or something
