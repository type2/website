Subject: EGR for 82 Vanagon

Hello all,

Picked up an 82 Vanagon a while back and have been attempting to get it back 
on the road.  On this last visit to the shop for a Maryland State Inspection 
they decided to do some research &amp; found that it was supposed to have an EGR 
valve, filter &amp; catalytic converter.  While the EGR valve was still there 
the filter, as well as the catalytic converter, are long gone.  The exhaust 
from the heater boxes back was replaced with a one piece muffler/pipe unit.

If I was to try to bring the exhaust back to the original setup, how much 
would I have to spend?  Is it possible to find parts for the EGR setup in 
junkyards in decent shape?

I don't think my wife would like it if I had to spend another $300 on this 
somewhat large project.
