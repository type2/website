Subject: Bus nose logo's...
Content-Disposition: inline

Howdy all,

After following the recent threads on the quality of repro Splitty Bus nose

logo's, I passed on some of the comments to Richard from Roundbox 
Tools, who has a nose logo repro in primer and chrome.  He said:

&quot;Thanks for the long letter/e-mail today. About the guy with the rusted
emblem
of ours...not one single complaint has come in like that about the
emblems!!
If it had I would have immediatly replaced it upon delivery for exchange.
These things have only been out there for 4 months and should not rust
unless
abused, and if that person were to send it back I would probably send him 2
more! Customer service is important to us right now.&quot; 

So, if the guy from Florida is out there reading along, and you ordered 
yours from &quot;Roundbox Tools&quot;, you need to e-mail Richard at:    
Oldred62_at_aol_dot_com       because he genuinely wants to help us all out 
with nice repro's.  I'm not affiliated with his business, but he seems like

a very decent guy, so we ought to give him a chance to address 
any problems.  

By the way, he's getting bids on the reproduction of the '68-'72 Bus nose 
logo now, and if there is enough interest, he'll probably make a go of that

one also.  If you want to give him your opinion on that (read &quot;encourage 
him&quot;), just e-mail Richard.

Take care everybody,

Bill Bowman
NEATO Pres.
LiMBO MO Rep.
