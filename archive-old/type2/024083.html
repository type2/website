Subject: Stuck in gear
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I would like to pull the engine in my 80 Westy.  The archive instructions 
specify putting the transmission in neutral to disengage the cv joints, but 
my problem is that the trans is stuck in 4th gear (why I want to pull the 
engine in the first place).  Is it really necessary to have the trans in 
neutral?  If so, maybe just removing the nosecone would be a better way to 
go?  Thanks.
