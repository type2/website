Morris, my new 74 $400 special has an RVEECO oil filter already installed.
The lines go under the tinware. I didn't do the work, but if no other
responses, I'll try to answer any questiions you have by looking at my rig.
BTW, old archives had a little on the subject, but never was clear on amount
of oil to use. Marv Krupp 78 loaf/72 hightop/74 Westy/63 1500S
