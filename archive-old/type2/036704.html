HELP!

I have a 72 Type II that has run great for several years.   A few days
ago my son told me he had trouble getting home and  the van was making
HUGE clouds of smoke.   Today, I drove it and it ran a little rough but I
saw no smoke until it got warm, suddenly I was making such a cloud of
smoke that the people behind me had to turn on their headlights!!!

It only made the smoke while the engine was under load.  With the clutch
pushed in, no smoke.

I nursed her home and called my mechanic.   I will tow her to the
mechanic on Wednesday.

Please tell me what might be the problem, how it could have happened, how
can it be repaired and what is the approximate cost.

Private e-mails are better since I will not be able to check the Type 2
list while I am at work.
