Subject: Counterfeit VW parts

I can understand VW's position in regards to counterfeit parts. 
Someone installs counterfeit brake parts and they fail causing a 
fatal accident. VW may have to defend themselves in a lawsuit and 
would would probably a hard time convincing a jury and the public 
that it was not their part that failed if it has VW stamped on it.

The PR from a spate of accidents that is not their fault would be 
worse for them than the PR from going after counterfeiters.


&gt;There has been a flurry of posts regarding VWoA going after anything
&gt;and anybody that they think is stepping on their copyright and
&gt;trademark toes. From a legal standpoint they have a right to protect
&gt;their legal interests and there is little that can or should be done
&gt;to stop them. HOWEVER.......there is public relations issue to
&gt;consider. Yesterday the type2 list received the following SPAM.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I cannot imagine the size of the balls that they have to go after
&gt;aftermarket suppliers that keep us in parts and then ask us to
&gt;consider buying what will certainly be a $30,000 &quot;microbus&quot;
&gt;
&gt;If I wanted so spend $30k on a microbus I would call Lenny at West
&gt;Coast Classics and ask him what he had on the lot. I am sure I could
&gt;get a really nice 196x 2x window bus for about $30k and I would not
&gt;need to worry about going to the dealership for an oil change.
