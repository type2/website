Subject: Re: [T2] GE redline

&gt; What is the red line for the GE engine? The original rev limiting rotor
&gt; (04016) is rated for 5400pm

I have the 1st Edition Volkswagen Type 2 Repair Manual. NOT by Bentley, this is the real VW factory manual and
it covers 74, 75, and 76 USA buses.
I was looking for a vacuum diagram for the dual vacuum unit distributor to see where retard gets its signal
but I didn't find any. 79 Cal gets it from the rear of the throttle housing by the idle speed screw.
But what I did find was rather interesting.
In the section of 'ignition system', pages 28.2 and 28.3, are specs on the distributors for the ED 1800 and
the GD 2.0.  Towards the bottom of 2.0 page is &quot;Speed limiter in control unit cut-in speed&quot; and it says 5400
rpm!!!
For the 1800, it says &quot;Speed limiter* cut-in speed&quot; and the asterick says &quot;For California: speed limiter in
control unit&quot;. ED speed limit is also 5400 rpm. [1974 Cal 1800 w/auto trans came with EFI, all other 74's came
with dual carbs]
By 'control unit', I am assuming the EFI ECU?
I searched the 68-79 Bentley and found zero reference to this.

Jim's dist site shows this for 76-79:

Bus &amp; Pickup Late 1976-1978 All States, 1979 Federal * 2000
Note: This Distributor also fits Type 4 (412) 1974
Distributor: VW 021-905-205P, Bosch 0231 168 005 &gt; 022-905-205S, 0231 170 093
Note: 0231 170 093 dist primarily used on California Late 1976-1978 and all Federal 1979 Models
Rotor: 04 033
Note: 0231 168 005 dist originally equipped with Speed Limiting Rotor 04 016 (5400rpm)

According to the VW manual, the 021-P is 49 state and Canada. (005)
And the 022-S (093) is California. So why would the 49 state dizzy use the speed limiting rotor when the ECU
has it built in? Only Calif ECU's have the limiter built in? My book says all have it.....
Is this one of the differences between the 4 ECU's available for each year?
