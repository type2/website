Subject: Re: [T2] Wont start update

&gt; I ain't sure what a self supporting starer tester is--my guy lays it on
&gt; the bench--hookks up the wires,and puts the juice to it---he holds it
&gt; down with his hand.

All air cooled VW starters have an exposed end out past the starter drive. The
bushing to SUPPORT the armature is pressed into the trans bellhousing. *Except
the auto stick-shift and bus auto trans starters. These are self-supported
starters. You do not need the bushing in the bellhousing for these. They will
spin out of the car.

&gt; Reads the current draw, and thats the end of it---

Unless he supports the end of the armature, it will DRAG on the pole shoes.

 &gt; All he does is rebuilds starters and alternators / generators, been at
&gt; it for 30 years--and he does all my Mack starters / generators/
&gt; alternators.
&gt;
&gt; So they jump around on the bench a little bit---at least I know what the
&gt; condition of the windings / brushes/ diodes whatever is--

No way, no how!
You CANNOT test a VW starter with it jumping around on the bench!!
