 &gt;&gt;Hello Everyone,
I just got an email from Sharon Simpson, she has lined up someone to 
do T shirts for JBB, Steve, who did the shirts for Natural Bus this 
year. However, Sharon needs to know ASAP who wants shirts and what 
size(s). If you want a shirt, please email her ASAP at
toby.gun_at_verizon_dot_net
Also, don't forget to call the campground (KOA in Harper's Ferry) and 
reserve your site-don't forget to mention John Brown's Buses.
One last thing, would someone please cross-post this to the Vanagon 
list and any other bus lists?   Thanks,   Jeff&lt;&lt;


When is this happening?
