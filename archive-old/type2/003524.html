Hello everybody.

This is our first post to this list as we have only just subscribed having
bought our very first VW van. (Currently in the process of being named, so
far we have tried Zebedee, Esmerelda, Boris, Brunnhilde........ ( My husband
is not impressed by my suggestions!!!))

On a more serious note, she's a 1976 1600cc pop-top in dire need of care and
attention. We live in London UK and see this as a functional long term
project. The most important thing at the moment is to make the body sound.
The engine is great. If any of you know of any UK contacts or mailing lists
we would love to hear about them.

We'd also like to know of any recommended reading material.

We think that's about all for now, look forward to continuing this
conversation with you all later.
