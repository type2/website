For maximum acceleration, you should keep the engine RPM as close to the
power peak as possible.  This means that on every shift you should rev
past the power peak until the engine power drops to the same amount as it
will be after shifting to the next higher gear.

Now, in the real world this is really BS, since not many of us are
entering our buses in the F1 circuit.  You should be able to rev a bit
past the power peak, but 5000 would be more than enough.
