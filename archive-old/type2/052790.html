It so happens that the series is shooting here in Van, BC.  I am a drummer and
have been on some episodes as a band member. (check out the one with the
political rally, ep. #4 ? )
If and when I get called back, I'll see if I can snap some shots for the list.
It's actually only a shell of a van on a dolly, towed around to the shoots. Lots
of hi-tech instrument mock-up on the inside.

MOVIE MAGIC!!!
