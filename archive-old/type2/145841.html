&gt;This is what I was told (or what I remember being told ...it was a few years

&gt;correctly, to the same running VW engine. The timing was different for all
&gt;of them by as much as 2 deg. If someone has a few different timing light,

I've noticed the difference as well and it probably explains why VW went to great lengths with their diagnostic harness to use the dowels on the rear of the flywheel to set the timing:

Of course, that device probably has to be calibrated also. :-)
