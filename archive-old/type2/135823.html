&lt;&lt; Maybe something about a rich man's car, something about a working man's 
car, a commerical vehicle, something 2 wheeled, etc. Ought to appeal to a wide 
range of readers. Leave the bikini's and other attractions favored by the 17 
year old crowd to another magazine. I can see all the boobs and butts in other 
magazines... 

I'd subscribe real damn quick. They'd better keep it from being condescending 
towards the common cars or they are junk to me!

What you're describing is the Brit Mag &quot;Practical Classics&quot;...Google it up for
a look see...Too bad it's &quot;just&quot; for British iron, so most of the references
are to cars and services available to tea baggers... ;-(
