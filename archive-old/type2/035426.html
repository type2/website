Subject: Re: Broken Crank.....

&gt; Last week I had the misfortune of dealing with a bunk crank from a
&gt; rebuild on my 2000cc.  I 've checked the library and archives and I
&gt; haven't found any information as to specifics I should check aside from
&gt; wear and tear.  The crankshaft completely split just behind the No. 1
&gt; piston push rod.  The engine was not run for more that 5 minutes after
&gt; the event.  The engine has around 22k miles on it, and I am wondering
&gt; what else possibly could have been ruined before mantling the engine. 
&gt; Bearings?  the Cam? 

I broke a crank at just that spot once on my 1978 Westfalia. Mine went at 
about 12K on a new rebuild that I did myself with assistance from a local 
machinist who does a lot of work on VW racers, bugs and dune buggies. 

A friend of mine also broke a crankshaft once on a 1600 engine and didn't
even know it for quite a while. Apparently depending on the shape and
location of the break, the shaft may possibly still turn and function OK
for a while. Mine was a disasterous mess right away (LOUD knocking,
shuddering the whole bus, rammed my torque converter until it broke and
gushed blood red transmission fluid like a dying whale). The sooner you
shut down the better, so maybe you minimized damage by stopping right
away. 

You have to split the case and go right to the bottom of the engine to
replace it, so why skimp? Clean everything, have a machinist check
tolerance where all the bearings fit in. You may have rammed some
assymmetry into the case where a bearing fits. If you didn't throw a rod,
chances are the case is still useable. Cam probably OK, but check it just
to be sure. Rods the same. Definitely flush all the oil passages to be
sure there are no metal bits reducing flow anywhere. New bearings are
cheap, so replace all as a matter of course. With any luck at all you
won't be inside the case of your engine for another 150k miles or so, so
treat everything like that.  The cost of checking everything out now is
MUCH lower than the cost of getting back in here to do it again later if
necessary, so check everything. 

Folks will tell you that a broken crankshaft is very uncommon, but they do
break. I never learned WHY mine broke. Just one of those things. John Muir
says you should suspend a new crankshaft by one end and strike it with a
tool (not on a bearing surface). It should ring like a bell. If it
doesn't, there are fractures in it and you should not use it. OTOH, I did
that with the one that died on me and it sounded good going in. There may
well be higher tech ways to inspect them. A good machinist can tell you. 

Good luck,
