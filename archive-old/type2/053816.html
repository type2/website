Subject: Re: Do two thin wires = 1 thick wire?

&gt;Ok, I know this is a little on the cheap side, but that 10 or 12 guage wire
&gt;is so so expensive.  I was wondering:  If I use two 16-guage wires, does
&gt;that improve the power handling and efficiency of the wires?
&gt;
Don't do it.  The sparkies on the list will no doubt explain why in better
detail, but you're always safer staying on spec with the power cabling.
