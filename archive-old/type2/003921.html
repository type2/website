&gt; &gt; 093??   What is that?
&gt; &gt; What is the complete number on yours?
&gt;
&gt; Hey there Guys,
&gt;
&gt; 0231 170 093 would be the correct dizzy for a 79 FED spec bus. I
&gt; think that the &quot;093&quot; (aka 022-905-205S) was also used on 76-78 buses
&gt; (I'm not sure if it's a fed/ca thing). The reason I reconignized the
&gt; 093 is 'cause I've got one of those in my bus (79 fed).

I was trying to answer his question by what he said HE had in his bus:

''Having pulled the distributor to check p/n I have discovered a modified 009 in
my 79 california bus engine. It has the air biscuit (two tubes) attached to the
side and it has electronic ignition.''

The 205S [093] does not have a dual vacuum unit or electronic ignition......
