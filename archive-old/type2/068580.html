Subject: '77 Heat?

I guess that I didn't make myself very clear. (My SO complains about that
ALL the time...;))  What I was asking was what volume of heated air is
normal for a loaf at road speed with the blower operating?  For instance,
in the defrost position, should the volume be enough to lift a sheet of
paper laid over the defroster outlet?  blow it off the dash? blow it to the
rear of the driver's compartment? through the tailgate? ;)  Maybe it's
working fine.

Jim
