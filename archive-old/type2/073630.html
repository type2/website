Subject: Re: [T2] Maintence on an old bus

Some additional thoughts on what Rick Taylor wrote:

&gt; To bring a fuel injected bus out of moth balls:

&gt; 1.  Remove the cylinder tin and clean out any mouse, wasp or hornet nests.

Yes.  And while it's out, clean it and repaint it, and crawl on top of and
underneath the engine with a small paint brush and a can of laquer thinner
and a rag, and clean off all the accumulated grease.  First thing my high
school auto shop teacher made us do.
&gt; 2.  Replace ALL fuel lines and filter.

Right.  Also the rubber grommets, usually missing, in the tin, especially
where the fuel line comes through.

&gt; 4.  While your under the bus, check out engine and tranny mounts.

More places to clean grease.
