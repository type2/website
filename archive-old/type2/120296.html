&gt;    looked in the back and the impeller (fan) was off the crankshaft, the

&gt; was racing a snow storm, so just put the bolt back in and torqued it down
&gt; tight.....engine started right up and quickly cooled down. so got back on
&gt; the road..

you know bob, if that center bolt started to back out it wouldn't take
much for the belts tension to kinda pull the fan off it's tapered end
of the crank. I would just put some lock-tite on the bolt. but that is
strange thought.
