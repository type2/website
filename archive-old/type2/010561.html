Hi Chad -

First of all, Good Troubleshooting!  You've covered the bases pretty
well, and it it's  _reeely_  helpful to have solid mechanical info to
base ideas on.  Looking at what you earlier wrote:

&gt; All the ingredients for combustion seem to be present: the fuel/air
mixture is shared with #4, which is firing just fine; 

Actually, although both cylinders share the same carb, that doesn't mean
they share the same  _mixture_ .  Perhaps the manifold gasket for #3
cylinder is leaking at the manifold-to-head connection.  Try squirting [a
little] carb cleaner around the gasket edge.  Don't get carried away and
douse it; just a quick spritz.  If there is an air leak, the engine idle
speed will immediately pick up.  If yer lucky, it's just a matter of
tightening intake bolts....  HTH!
