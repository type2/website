Thanks for all your pmail to my last post about the broken water port on
my 78 Westy.

Although many suggested that I would find this part at an RV shop, I
have tried 2 shops and failed.  Here is what the old one is identified
with under the hinged plastic cover.

IAPMO T-1141
A &amp; E Systems
Santa Anna CA
PN.C.W. - 146

This water port has a check valve built in to prevent water from the
tank from coming back out. 

A web search was unsuccessful.  Does anyone have a Santa Anna phone book
to see if this company is still around?  Any other sources for this
part?

Thanks
Ed
