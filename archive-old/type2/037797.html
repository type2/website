Subject: Re: windshield removal

Hi Pete
It's easy!
All you have to do is first go around the seal with a razor knife on the
outside held so that it goes between the windshield and the gasket
parallel to the windshield.  Then you go around again, this time cutting
90 degrees to the windshield.  What you have done then is simply cut the
gasket away from the outside.  Then get a helper to keep the windshield
from succumbing to gravity and push from the inside, from 1 corner
working it loose and away from the rest of the gasket.  The glass is
tougher than you think.
