Subject: RE: '78 &amp; '79 Deluxe Middle sliding windows

&gt; I have a 1973 Transporter and installed the sliding windows 
&gt; on them as well. 
&gt; 
&gt; Personally, I really like the sliding windows. They offer 
&gt; MUCH MUCH more air-flow to the inside of the bus. 


For those who would like to upgrade their bus, I have a VERY limited
quantity of these sliding windows, BRAND NEW from the OEM supplier to
Volkswagen, for $139 each. 

If you have a vent wing window there now, and your seals are getting old
or your vent wing rusty, this upgrade is a no-brainer. It will cost you
$80 per side to replace your existing seals (as the vent wing seal alone
is $60). By comparison, it costs only $20 for a seal for the sliding
window (which is indeed the same as the one-piece-fixed-window seal). So
you'll save enough in seal cost alone to cover nearly half of what it
costs you to upgrade to the nicer sliding windows. And you'll get much
better ventilation (and eliminate that rusty vent wing) to boot.  

Of course, these can just as easily replace a fixed-window that has no
vent (adding much more ventilation to your bus!) or a worn out camper
louvered window.
