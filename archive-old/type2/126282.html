Subject: Videos of BYOB weekend

Excuse the amateurish videos, but this is my first time using the Microsoft 
video editor that comes with windows XP.

I put together a collage of little videos from last weekend.
It starts with Clara &amp; Taylor, goes to the Barbeque at Volksauthority &amp; ends 
with me following Roger Nang back from the Red Barn in the rain. I do not know 
why my windscreen wiper appears to flex on the video.
When I play the video in my machine locally it plays in media player &amp; looks 
best when seen at 1:1.
In the link it seems to be placed in some Microsoft site player, so does not 
look as good.
If you know how to fix the link to a video in HTML please let me know.

The link is  http://blueridgejan_dot_com/samsbus/shows_trips/index.html

When you get there you can click to go either to the small 3 meg file or the 
best quality 8 meg file.

Have fun
