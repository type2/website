Hi Clark,

It depends on which idiot light switch you use.  My
original VW switch comes on at 4.5 psi, the VDO at 10
psi.  I use the VW switch because I just don't like to
see that red light come on at hot idle.  I'm probably
running 7.5 psi for HIOL.  I think most rebuilders
hope that owners don't have accurate oil pressure
gages, because I haven't found one that will guarantee
what your HIOP will be.  

Rob
