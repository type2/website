&gt; Hi list, can you offer suggestions:
&gt;
&gt; Sande's '71 Super Beetle has developed turn signal woes. When the 
&gt; ignition is switched on, the green turn signal arrow on the dash comes 
&gt; on solid, full-time until the ignition is switched off. The turn 
&gt; signals no longer work at all, and the switch produces no change in the 
&gt; dash light either.
&gt;
&gt; Switch, wiring, or relay?
&gt;
&gt; Thank you,
