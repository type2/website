Subject: [T2] My bus is getting a 2L!

Hi Volks,

I'm just wanting to annouce that my 1972 westy is getting the 1700cc carbed engine replaced with a 2Ltr with stock fuel injection.  It's at the Tech Shop in Seattle.  I got the engine through the Bus Depot.  The FI is from a bone yard.  

I'm excited but thought I'd also ask if there is anything I should know.  The single carb set-up I had in for 6 mo. is gone so no more painfully long engine warm-ups.  But is there a break in time, ajust the FI in how many miles...etc.  Thought I'd ask.

Thanks,

Brita Rae
1972 Westy - Rudy the Bus
