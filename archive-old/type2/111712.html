Subject: Re: [T2] Type 4 tin assembly :-o

There are two pieces of tin that you install before
puttng the cooling air shroud on. The first one goes
over the oil cooler. The second one goes in front of
the #2 cylinder then put the cooling air shroud on,
all the rest can go on without having to pull
something off. Phil
