Subject: Re: [T2] Wanting a good foam - and NOT from a beer for a
  change!

I went to http://www.friendlyfoam_dot_com/

I can't remember what I paid exactly but I got a piece for the back of
my 75. I do remember that it was cheaper than JoAnn and custom cut to
the size I requested....  They happened to be local for me but they
ship anywhere.  If you can give them a pattern they will also custom
cut and even upholster it for you if you want(for extra but I remember
it being very reasonable around 40 bucks or so).

I'm not affiliated in any way with them, just a satisfied customer and
fellow dubber who faced a similar dilemma.

&gt; &gt; JoAnn wants $90 for a 4x24x76
&gt; &gt; and most foam places in Denver want WELL over $130.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; Those prices are fair. Make sure you're getting DENSE foam.
&gt;
&gt; Troy's in the process of buying some... Maybe a group discount could be had?
