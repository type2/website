Subject: 6-ply tires and &quot;reinforced&quot; (was: Costco Kirkland $48 LT tire)

Ok,

Karl von Salzen replied to me saying that the tires I just purchased
aren't re-enforced, so they will suffer from sidewall stability
problems.  I'm confused by this, as I thought that the main point of
getting 6-ply LT tires was to get the extra ply in the sidewall (2 vs 1
in a passenger tire).

Despite there being a lot of tire threads in the archives, there really
aren't that many that are INFORMATIVE!  So some may think tires are a
topic that have been hashed and re-hashed, but if you search the
archives you will find that it just isn't the case.  There are a lot of
&quot;what should I get&quot;, but not a whole lot of basics explaining the real
differences.  Like:  Who OEM's these tires for Costco?  I'm suspecting
that this Kirkland is just a house brand that Costco has one of the
larger mfg's produce for them.  There can't be TOO many companies who
make 14 inch LT tires?

The Costco Kirkland $48 LT tires are:
  &quot;All Season&quot;
  LT195/75R14 93/90Q M+S
  Load Range C
  Main Tread: 2 Polyester + 2 Steel
  Sidewall:  2 Polyester
  Max Load Single:  1435 Lbs at 50PSI COLD
  Max load Dual: 1325 Lbs at 50PSI COLD

Karl, aren't you just splitting hairs?  Aren't the evil tires that we
are all avoiding 1-ply sidewall &quot;PASSENGER tires&quot;?  Am I correct,
looking at Karl's feedback, to determine that there is a order something
like this:

  1) Passenger tires -- 4 ply = 3 tread plys, 1 sidewall ply.
  2) LT tires -- 6 ply = 4 tread plys, 2 sidewall plys.
  3) LT tires -- 6 ply.  Same as #2, but &quot;Reinforced&quot;?
  4) LT tires -- 8 ply = 5 tread plys, 3 sidewall plys.
  5) Same as #4 but &quot;Reinforced&quot;?

Confused.

[edit note, I asked Karl to explain this short reply further, and he
replied a second time with this next section:]

The 6 ply and 4 ply is in the tread area. The side wall is 2 ply but the

difference is the thickness of the sidewall. Michelin MX 185/14 
passenger tire tread is 4 ply, 2 steel and 2 rayon. The side wall is 2 
ply rayon. The load limit is 1450 lbs.
Michelin MX 185/14 reinforced has the same ply material in the tread and

sidewall but the load limit is 1540 lbs. The difference is in the 
thickness of the side walls. 
Thicker side walls reduces the flexibility of the tire.
