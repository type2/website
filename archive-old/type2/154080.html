Subject: Re: Only idles with choke fully closed + Thermostat Question

Now that makes sense.

 

My brand-spanking-new 1600 DP doesn't have the stud for mounting the
thermostat so I had to omit it. My previous stock motor had the thermostat
and it ran like a champ.

 

Does anyone know if I can or should drill and tap a AS41 case for the
thermostat mount? 

 

rest of the motor is totally stock with the stovepipe in place and stock air
cleaner. The only exception is I added a SVDA and a Hot Spark (which rocks
and oh sooooo cheap).

You should also have the stock thermostat to bring the engine temp to
operating level ASAP.
