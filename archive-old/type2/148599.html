Subject: Re: [T2] problem with my battery draining

There's a bunch about battery drain in the archives.

From http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/140121.html :

______________

Do you have an ammeter that you can put in series with the
battery? Most ordinary hand held multi-meters have an ammeter
function. Mine has a 0 - 10A range that is just right for the
following test.

Leave the engine off during this exercise.

Disconnect the wire that connects the negative terminal of the
battery to chassis ground. Temporarily insert the ammeter between
terminal and ground, using extra wires with clip leads.

You are now reading all current flowing in the battery circuit. If
the meter reads zero or just a few tens of milliamps, this is as it
should be. (some radios draw this much current to maintain station
settings.) If the meter reads a lot more than this, you need to
isolate the circuit that is allowing this flow.  If you read several
amps, you have definitely located the cause of your battery drain
problem.

Isolate the circuit by removing fuses, one at a time. After each is
removed, check the ammeter reading again. If the current drops after
a particular fuse is removed, you have identified the hurting circuit.

Next, delve into the circuit diagram for your vehicle in Bentley.
Trace out the circuit that contains the fuse that you just
identified.  Stare at the wires in this circuit, poke them with a
dowel, etc until you find the component that is causing the above
normal current flow.

And don't try to start it.

&gt; well my interstate battery was only 2 weeks old or so
&gt; it was brand new so i pulled the drained battery and
&gt; brought it by my local firestone and they told me to
&gt; come back in a couple hours when they charge it and
&gt; retest it i don't have any thing draining the battery
&gt; when the bus is off except the vdo clock in the
&gt; dashboard. My radio is off i have a toggle switch to
&gt; turn it on and off when i gho to car shows if anybody
&gt; has any suggestions i would be grateful
