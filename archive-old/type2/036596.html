&gt; years old. So it looks as though I'm in the market for batteries.


pick up a small charger too, automatic type with a trickle circuit

&gt; Before I head on down to Sears,  does anyone have good or bad experiences
&gt; with various brands to share?  Does any  brand beat the odds and give a
&gt; good unit every time?

there is no such thing as a company that makes a perfect product 100% of
the time (even VW) but at least Exide backs up their batteries, the one
time I got a bad one they covered it 100% (most places pro rate)
