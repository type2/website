&gt; OK, it's Friday....

pushing my 65 Westy up Red Mountain Pass at night in Colo on two lane US
550 out of Silverton to Ouray.  

here in the East there is a nice little climb out of Romney WV to Mt
Storm on US 50 too....

and then there are a few roads into some of my favorite ski slopes but
those I'm not telling.

&gt; 
&gt; There are two that stand out in my mind.
&gt; 
&gt; First, Ferndale to Capetown on CA211 in California.  Crossing the coastal
&gt; range on a two lane road.  The altitude is not great, but you are doing
&gt; 2Kfeet in 2-3 miles!  And the drive down is worse... this is the only time
&gt; I have ever lost brakes due to overheated pads.  A scary experience.
&gt; 
&gt; At the same time, I do recommend this drive highly (with appropriate
&gt; caution)! Ferndale is a stunningly beautiful little town, full of Victoian
&gt; houses from the timber boom. Hawks soar in the pass constantly and the
&gt; descent to the coast is georgeous!  The best part is that after travelling
&gt; about 10-15 miles along a totally deserted section of coast, yu re-cross
&gt; the coastal range at Honeydew and come into the back end of ther Humboldt
&gt; Redwoods, near the upper campground.  I have not yet failed to find a spot
&gt; there and they have a bin full of redwood trimmings for use as firewood!
&gt; Fill up (subtly) on your way out, and you can have a redwood campfire in
&gt; the middle of the Mojave :-)
&gt; 
&gt; The second really steep climb is in Wyoming... coming out of Jackson on
&gt; Rt. 22.  Route 26, the main N/S drag thru the park is not bad, steep, but
&gt; do-able. Rt. 22 attacks the mountain directly and I do *not* recommend it!
&gt; thousands of feet of climb in 1st and 2nd for way too long, way too many
&gt; cool down breaks, and *way* too far from home in case of a breakdown.
