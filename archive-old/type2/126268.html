&gt;The SVDA I received is based on a Hecho en Mexico Bosch 0 231 170 034

I spoke a little prematurely on that. The information is in the type2 library and look at the matches:

I recently noticed a Bosch vacuum can distributor has appeared at a few of the online vendors:

http://www.cbperformance_dot_com/catalog.asp?ProductID=1348

http://www2.cip1_dot_com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=VWC%2D043%2D905%2D205

Clearly it is a Type I distributor and the 043-905-205 part number gives that away.

I had CIP1 pull one from the warehouse shelf and read me the Bosch number and it's 0 231 170 034, the same unit that Jason got from ACN. It looks like ACN has stopped rebuilding cores and repainting them like the photo on the website shows and they are modifying these new Mexican units that are widely available.

Now I wonder, sine the vacuum can was probably left alone, how has this unit have been modified for the type 4 bus engine? Is there a source for weights and springs?
