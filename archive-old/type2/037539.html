I'd say you've had a bit better luck with your
pertronix than I did with mine. 

I bought and installed a Pertronix unit a few years
back, when I first bought my '69 Westy. I'd been
having some intermittant &quot;sputter&quot; that didn't clear
up after a full tuning (even a new Bosch coil), so I
figured the Pertronix wouldn't hurt and I bought
one....

...The first unit failed out of the box (the
instructions even say that this isn't uncommon...talk
about quality control). I returned it and tried
another one.... 

...It ran, but wouldn't time properly. I took it to an
ACVW mechanic friend (a Pro) and he timed it dead-on
at idle, but it wouldn't go to full advance... He set
it to the proper full-advance, but it ran rough at
idle!! He finally adjusted it by feel and got it to
run 'reasonably', but no better than it did with
points/condenser.

I even went so far as replacing the distributor (.009)
with a new unit. The intermittant &quot;sputter&quot; cleared
up, but I still had the same problems timing it. I
drove it that way for a few hundred miles, before I
finally pulled the damned thing and went back to
points/condensor. I haven't had a problem since.

I still have the unit and if I find myself *really*
bored some day, I may try it again. Doubtfull, but you
never know... It's not like I enjoy replacing my points.
