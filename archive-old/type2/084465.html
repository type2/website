Subject: Temperature Gauge readings - Empirical data

Doktor Tim covered it, but here are my numbers....the problem is:
the senders and the gauges are all a bit different, so...take this with a
grain of salt, eh?

-what should cyl. head temp be?

Mine can run as high as 425 on the VDO, but generally is between 350 and
400. Depending on a thousand things....it is hard to read on that one as
the spread is so great. I like it at 350 and can keep it there by running
at or below 55. I rarely do.

-what should oil temp be?  200 degrees. Mine is rock steady.

-what should oil pressure be?

It varies. Mine starts out running a little high at 55 - 60 then drops to
40 and stays there during running.

Those are my numbers on my 75 1800cc Westy AND my 72 bored out 1600cc (I
think to about 1740cc) Loaf.

So, whatever they should be, this is what they are. On both of them. So,
I feel OK when they are in this range. Both engines are clean and purr
like kittens.
