Subject: Re: [T2] Wiring ledes from Battery

See my rant from last year here..&lt;grin&gt;

http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/137155.html

I can't stress enough to get the &quot;modern&quot; type of battery clamp rather 
than the &quot;leaded&quot; type....it is truely worth it!

The link in the archived post is dead, but the folks at the FLAPS will 
point them out to you when you say &quot;non-leaded&quot;....measure what you need 
before you go.


See ratwell_dot_com for more info from Richard.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Volks,

&gt; 
&gt; I examined the leads again today, and the wiring looks pretty bad. I am 
&gt; thinking R/R.
&gt; 
&gt; What's the best route to take with this, and if replacement is 
&gt; warranted, what exactly is the name of this wiring piece(s).
&gt; 
&gt; Many grits,
