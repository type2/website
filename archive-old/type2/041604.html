two 16ga wires will handle more current than onr 16ga wire, but not as
much as a 12ga wire

Here's a handy thing I found out a few years back:

If you need a few feet of 8ga wire, the cheapest way to get it is to go to
your local FLAPS and buy a cheap set of jumper cables!  The cheapies tend
to use 8ga wire which is thin by jumper cable standards but is just the
thing for your second battery.  I use this stuff for my power-hungry
amateur radio equipment.
