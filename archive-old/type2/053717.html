Subject: '72 Master cylinder reservoir

Listees,

I have a '72 Westy I've been working on for several months.  My latest
challenge is the Master Cylinder.  I have a new one to go in, but I'm having
some difficulty with the removal of the old one.

Specifically, the Haynes manual says to &quot;pry&quot; off the brake fluid reservoir
off the master cylinder.  First from the back of the cylinder and then from
the front.
  
I've been trying, but instinct tells me that if I do any more &quot;prying&quot; I'm
going to brake something (pardon the pun)  

How do I get the plastic fluid reservoir off the top of the Master 
Cylinder?  Ok, how do I get it off in one piece?

Any suggestions greatly appreciated.
