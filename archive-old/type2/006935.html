Wellllllllllllllllll, it almost works that way. On the late ' 79 Bays, and 
forward from the  ' 80 Vanagon, VW switched to a &quot;mushroom top&quot; that sits on 
the heater control boxes, where the flex hose use to take off from. Vented, 
you guessed it, right into the area in front of the eng. Did away with the 
aux. tail pipes/flex hose setup. No lawsuits or deaths were reported.....
