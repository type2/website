Subject: CV Bolts

My CV came loose today and somewhere along the way I lost 2 bolts and the
metal piece that holds them.  Plus another bolt broke off.  Anyway.  Could I
use washers in place of the metal piece or are they held together for a
reason?  I have to drive it to get the washers or whatever I use.  I went
ahead and tightened down 2 new bolts without the spacer to get me to the store
tomorrow.  Is this not good? OR maybe ok for a few miles?
