&gt;Maybe we can get a group tour up and then tour the factory there as
&gt;well...I would *love* to take movies of them installing lots of stuff(from
&gt;the how the hell did they do that files).  Especially the headliners!
&gt;Wonder how long it takes *them* to install a new front window?

&gt;Anyone up for a group tour to Brazil????

Hi Folks,

Perhaps if we can get enough people together, we could &quot;borrow&quot; a few parts 
from the parts bins, bring them back to the U.S., and assemble our own Brand 
New Type2_dot_com Bus!  Small stuff could be pretty easy; I'm just having 
trouble figuring out how to get a complete Bus unibody into my suitcase...
