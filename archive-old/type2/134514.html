Subject: Thanks Ben for the Motor Pull page- happy Friday everybody

Nice documentation on your engine pull Ben.  The photos, their order and the
fact that you put it all up there for everybody and their pet monkey to look
at should be commended.  Thanks for posting that, I liked it a lot.
---------------------------------------------------------------

On a side note,  picking Freidrich up from the garage today after having all
four ball joints pressed out and replaced....  am greatly anticipating
driving my bus this weekend... also sprang for an MSD to replace my points,
so it should feel like a different bus when I get it on the road.  Although
I will miss the snickers and guffaws that my co-workers here at the office
would make whenever I would say 'massaged' or 'pressed' or 'ball joints'.  I
figure I can take that in stride though since they don't laugh at me for
taking my Bentley manual with me wherever I go,.. whether driving a bus that
day or not.  God Bless 'em

Happy Friday everybody!
