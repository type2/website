Subject: Report on repairs - valve job and wrap up.

Volks,

As you may remeber since the end of May I have been wreslting with my
valves.  So far, I have gotten the new heads (AVP from Bus Depot) on and
the engine back in thanks in large part ot a half a dozen list members who
stopped by at one time or another to help. 

Three weeks in hell followed installation during which the engine would
not start for more than a second or two, combined with some double relay
wierness. Finally gave up, had it towed to Paul's VW Repair in Annandale
VA (my deus-ex-machina) and handed it over to them.  They found a loose
ground in the FI and a couple of loose vacuum hoses.  I think the loose
ground was the problem, as we had checked and re-checked the vac lines,
but had experienced a couple of backfires, too.  

Anyway...  So I got the car back, running, but gutless and making a valve
clatter to beat the band.  Next step was obviously valve adjustment, but
complicated by not having run the engine for 2 months.  After a round or
two of adjustments, I now have a quiet engine.  Big secret was to follow
directions :-)  First couple of times we adjusted the valves by puting the
engine at #1 TDC and adjusting the #1 &amp; #3 valves, then turn to #4 and do
#2 &amp; #4 valves.  That did not work! When I went back today and did it &quot;by
the book&quot; everything quieted right down.

Final question...  The car is now running, and seems fine except that the
vacuum guage is giving me &lt; 10&quot; of vacuum. Now in the past, VW's have
never been champs in this department, usually sitting at 14-15&quot;, which on
my guage is labeled &quot;late ignition timing&quot;.  I was not too worried, as I
know that on the big Detroit iron, you time 'em by twisting the dist 'til
it starts to stumble and back off a hair. Do this to a VW, and you toast
the engine in minutes!  Our timing is nowhere near as advanced as a V-8's,
but so what?  right is right!  On the other hand, I am now 1/3rd off where
I expect to be and this worries me no end, especially as I replaced all
the intake gaskets/hoses as well as the vac lines where possoble (some are
just not obtainable any more :-(((( What is wrong, does anyone know?  Are
the valves too tight?  Am I missing something?  is this normal?????
(nah... can't be)
