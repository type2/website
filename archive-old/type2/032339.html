&gt; Subject: Type2 list weekly road report (summer season)?
&gt; projects during last summer's safaries, I thought to myself what if there
&gt; was a way to list where these problems were so you could detour around
&gt; them?  I think the reason that most of us have buses is to travel in them

--&gt; You *do* know what this would entail, right?  I mean, just the list of
Michigan summer road work would fill a typewritten page, and that's just a
summary.
