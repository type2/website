This is correct. The rotor moves 90 degrees, the crank moves 180 degrees. 1 
complete revolution of the rotor fires four cylinders and the crank goes 
through 2 complete revolutions.

I quote from page 26 in the
Bentley for Supers, Beetles, And Karmanns 70-79:
        &quot; turn the engine until THE ROTOR moves counterclockwise 90 deg. from the 
#1
firing position. This will correctly position the #2 cylinder.....&quot;
Okay, if we turn the ENGINE 180 degs how far does the rotor turn? 90 deg?
This is my theory, though my car is not here to test it on. It is all in 
the wording.
Engine 180 deg = rotor 90 deg?????
