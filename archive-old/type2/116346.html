Subject: Re: [T2] What is the weight of a camper?

My 1970 owners manual lists the following unladen and gross vehicle 
weights (in US lbs), respectively:

Station Wagon: 2833, 4773
Kombi:  2755, 4927
Camping Wagon:  3173, 4773 (doesn't say if w/ or w/out pop top)
Delivery Van:  2557, 4927
Pick-up:  2634, 4927
Double Cab:  2722, 4927

This begs the question: Why do the Station Wagon and the Camping Wagon 
have lower GVWs?  Don't they all have identical suspensions and tires?

&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt; As you've been reading, there have been mixed replies to my idea of 
&gt; towing. So, to decide, I need to know, what is the weight of a VW 
&gt; Camper High Top? Anyone have a guess?
