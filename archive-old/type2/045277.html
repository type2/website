Subject: Re: [T2] Problem with dual 34's

Gentlepersons-
                       If you're flush, a K&amp;N gas/air meter is delovely to 
have for multiple carb
set-ups...Something around $200. Or Aircooled_dot_net I believe has their own. My 
buddy has
one on his Healey for setting up triple SU's. After going through enough 
needles to start
a sweatshop, he finally got the beast to idle AND run to redline without 
missing a beat...
