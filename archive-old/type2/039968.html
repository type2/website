My '73 bus came with a step up to the sliding door.  I've been told these are 
rare?  Anyways, I need to remove it so I can keep it for my new bus. Any clue 
how to do something like that?  I've looked it over and can't figure out how 
it is attached.  Its in the jack ports, but it doesn't appear to be bolted 
in.  Its probably something really obvious, but any help is appreciated. 
  Thanks,
   Amy
