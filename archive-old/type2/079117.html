Subject: Re: [T2] 71 interesting quirk


Classic symptom of a pilot bearing going bad and grabbing at the tip of the
mainshaft. Must remove clutch (pull the motor) to get to it. The worst
pirates will charge you $6 for the bearing, discounters maybe half that.
Too bad they didn't replace it at the last clutch job. You'll need a little
puller to pull it out, unless it's one of those rare ones that you can get
the tip of your little finger in there and it comes easy. Don't bet on it,
beg borrow rent or buy a pilot bearing puller and it's easy
squeeeeeeeeeezzzeee. They come in slide hammer variety and the screw drive
species. I like the screw drive type cause it's a controlled pull. Check
the SanFranBay web auction listings and your sure to see them from time to
time. Beware that the Chinese Cheese variety will bend on a tough, stuck
bearing. 

Squirt it periodically for a while with penetrant to dissolve the varnish
that sticks it like glue in the hole. Or, remove and replace the flywheel
nut. (71 T-I motor) They come with new bearings. Then you'll need tools
such as a flywheel lock (very cheap at VWMAG four color ad suppliers
typical of Californicadia Chinese Cheese Vendors) and something better than
Slant-eye fungus infested Blue for a 36mm socket, 3/4&quot; drive to be shur.
Then there's the breaker bar. I can testify that it takes a 12 foot cheater
and a skinny little peckerwood at about 8 feet and a medium hefty
peckerwood at 12 feet to shear off a 3/4&quot; drive S-K cross bar. I was
impressed with both the bar and the axel nut that wouldn't budge. That was
by far the toughest T-II axle nut I ever saw and I've seen a bunch, and it
was on MY T-II. Ask me how I got it off?? Bulley Tech, and a 'coupla
minutes of pouwding from a 1&quot; drive air gun pumped up to 160psi.

You simply must fix the bearing very soon. DO NOT plan to fix it after the
drive to Gramma's for family holidays. They can go real fast on you after
first symptoms appear. If you push it, it will mangle the end of the
mainshaft which then mangles the new bearing which then mangles the
mainshaft some more which then.......so you have to replace the mainshaft.
Park it 'till you can fix it or get it fixed, or it could cost you a tow
bill to TSFH (The Shop From Hell).

&gt;My new 71 Westy has an interesting quirk:  The transmission doesn't seem
to completely disengage while in Neutral.  It is VERY subtle and I didn't
notice it for about a week, but when the motor is running and it's in
neutral if you let the clutch out it will very discretely try to inch
forward. The ebrake holds it fine, and like I said it is not real
noticeable, but definitely there.  So, does this sound like a linkage
(coupling) problem or is the transmission possibly on its way out?  Please
tell me its likely a linkage problem!!!
