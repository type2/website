Subject: Exaust leak found!!(At least the first one)

Well I found out that my exaust is leaking between the tail pipe 
and muffler. My muffler is a '74 that has the dual hole trapaziodial
hook up to the heat exchangers. The tail pipe protrudes to the left 
and has a round inlet hole. I checked at all the local FLAPS,
and called RMMW and no one lists a replacement tail pipe. 
So tomarrow, I am going down to FLAPS to try to match a new
doughnut gasket to it. I also have to have one of the attatchment
flangs welded back on, case it was so rusty it broke. Looks
like I will have to buy a whole new exaust in the near future. :(
