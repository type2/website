All,

Speaking of new and rebuilt engines.  Has anyone bought an engine from
Precision German Imports here in Los Angeles? I'm contemplating buying a
1800cc engine for my 74 Automatic Bus from them.  With new Rings, ect it
costs $750 (with trade in engine).  What
should I be asking them before I buy?


Many thanks
