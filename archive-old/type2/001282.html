Adam, I am assuming here that you have a standard 1.6 engine with a standard
pump.  If this is the case you may well have a fuel pump leak which is going
into the crankcase rather than outside over the engine.
Smell the oil, if it has been changed recently, compare viscosity with the
remainder in the can you used.
Pump leak is the only explanation really.  If it's something else patent it
fast!
As the level is going up quickly, I would attend to it sooner rather than
later.  Gives 'baby boomer' a new potential meaning.

However...this morning I check the level and it was just over
&gt; the first mark on the oil dip stick(pretty low I guess)....so I didn't add
&gt; any oil..drove for about 20 minutes tops...had the bus parked for 5 hours
or
&gt; so...went to check the level before I left work and the oil level was much
&gt; higher..almost to the top line on the dip stick...Any ideas what is going
on
&gt; here?
