Subject: FS: 1973 auto 1700 Westy, spares (in UK.)

The time has come to sell my hideous old Westy, either as a fixer-upper or
as rolling spares.  She's a 1973 Westphalia with a 1700 engine and an auto
tranny.  She's running currently, and passed the last two MoT tests with
little more than a replaced bulb.

The auto tranny has never given me any trouble and although it thumps
changing from forward to reverse, I'm confident that this is down to the CVs
(which are shot) but any test is welcome.  The bearings and discs on the
front are a year old, the calipers rebuilt about 18 months ago.  The
mechanical fuel pump is dead so she's running an electric vane pump (as of
about nine mounths ago.)  The engine's running a home-built Weber single
choke progressive carb conversion (for the last three or four years,) but I
still have all of the original twin carb setup barring the air-filter box.

Cosmetically she looks truly awful.  The glass is all in good condition,
seals are excellent, front windscreen is new.  There's a 3/4 rock and roll
bed that works but could do with re-covering, a cool box, a twin-ring gas
cooker, a water tank, a storage cupboard, an overhead cupboard and a table.
The pop-top has seen better days.

If there's enough interest, I'll break for spares.

Cheers,

Chris (York, UK.)
