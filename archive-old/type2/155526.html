Subject: Don's Trip Report

Didn't actually leave the house until 6pm. (grr...)

So, of course, we got stuck in traffic on C-470. I decided to pull off and
eat dinner, letting the traffic settle down. Left again a little after 7pm.
The goal was Grand Junction by midnight. Made it with 10 minutes to spare.
Crashed in a Motel 6.

The Guac performed beautifully! Got 20mpg between Denver and Vail. Fully
loaded with people and luggage. =) (I didn't record the odo reading at Vail,
so don't know what I got from there.) I out-pulled the semis on the
verticals. Yay! Snow and lots of ice on the roads. In fact, I had people at
the gas station in Vail ask how I did over the ice. &quot;Fine&quot;, I said, and
pointed at the Hakkapeliitta tires. I'm glad I changed my mind and kept them
on. I-70 was a sheet of ice for 20 miles before the Eisenhower Tunnel, and
all the way to Vail.

Today I leave Grand Junction for Las Vegas. It's supposed to be in the 90's
in the desert.
