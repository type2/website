Subject: Re: [T2] After you get the CV's and axles off:

I do the same thing with my CVs but using a large zip lock bag.
Drop the CV in
Drop the grease in
Seal up and squeeze away.
Also works good for storing a set of lubed up and ready to go CVs
Imagine the looks on my neighbors face when he picked up this HEAVY baggie full
of grease.
&quot;What the heck is in that bag&quot;.

&gt;
&gt; &quot;CV grease is the only type of grease that will
&gt; work in this application as it does not migrate like other greases and will
&gt; not get thin under the heat and pressures that are generated.  Force the
&gt; grease all the way throught the CV by hand.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; I haven't done quite as many CV joints as Rick, but I do have a nifty little
&gt; trick for doing the actual greasing of CV joints.  Place your new (or
&gt; absolutely clean old) CV on a piece of plastic wrap.  Just the usual kitchen
&gt; variety plastic wrap (like Saran wrap).  You should have enough plastic wrap
&gt; (about a foot of it) to completly bundle up the CV joint.  Then add a big
&gt; dollop of moly (CV) grease and close up the plastic wrap around the CV joint.
&gt;  Secure with a rubber band.  THEN work the grease through the joint.  You'll
&gt; find that you can actually get &quot;pressure &quot; on the grease and force it into
&gt; all the little cavities between the balls.  It makes for a much better job
&gt; than doing it &quot;freehand&quot;.  What's more you keep your hands clean in the
&gt; process.
