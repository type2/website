To Ron and the List,
   On the subject of the poptop seal, anybody have a solution to the 
vibration you sometimes get at highway speeds? My seal is only a couple of 
years old, in good condition, and the luggage area is firmy attached, not 
missing any hardware. It makes a horrendous sound at 55+ mph. This past 
weekend I went to BBTT, most of the trip on I-81, at 60-65 mph. The only time 
I did'nt hear the vibration was when I had to play &quot;Mulan&quot; and &quot;Mickey Mouse 
Kid Songs&quot; tapes for my daughter, who was riding in the back. I only have 
front speakers, so I had to crank it up in order for her to hear. Rear 
speakers are coming soon...        Jeff S.
