Subject: 75 Fuel Injection on a 78 Engine?

Thanks once again for some excellent advise on this engine swap. I will
be sticking with the 1975 flywheel. The starter that came with the bus
seems healthy enough, besides I have a new disk for the 75.

I did get differing opinions on the flywheels influence on end play
though. I think I'll pick up a shim set before I get that far rebuilding
my engine. All the books recommend checking and adjusting if needed
anyway.

I can't find anyone within 100mi. who has a cleaning tank for aluminum
who does it for the public. What's the recommended cleaning solution for
cleaning out the case and heads? I remember using Berrimans B12 carb
cleaner years ago but it awfully expensive now.
