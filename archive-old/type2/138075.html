Subject: Re: [T2] Yep, it's a PCV valve ... sort of

The problem is, there is no way to determine the condition. It's all 
sealed, most of the gunk can't be seen, and it's impossible to clean 
out.

I don't know what the replacement specs on these were, but I'm pretty 
sure it wasn't every 25 years.

And what if one of those nasty gunk pellets gets dislodged, runs 
through the throttle and plenum, down the runners and into the intake 
port? Do you really want that inside your cylinder?
