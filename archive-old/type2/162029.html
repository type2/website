Hi Kevin,

You have one of two problems to resolve. It's either gonna be low oil  
pressure, or a faulty sensor circuit.

I would suggest putting an oil pressure gauge on it, and changing all  
the oil to 20W50. This will tell you for certain what's going on  
inside the engine and will verify the signal from the sensor circuit.  
In a worst-case scnario (low oil pressure initiates a rebuild) you  
will have the oil pressure gauge available to help break in the new  
engine.

A cheaper way to go would be a new sensor and wiring, but then you  
miss out on the oh-so-handy oil pressure data.

&gt; coolers common?  Bad sensor?  Pump?  I don't feel  comfortable at  
&gt; all driving it as it is.  Please help!   Cheers...KR

Happy Trails,
