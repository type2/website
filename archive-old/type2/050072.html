Subject: [T2] Two Volkswagen camper

These are not mine I found them on the internet

Two (2) 1974 VW Campers... Each has a 2-litre engine, with: hydraulic
valves, sink, ice box, and pop top! Separately - one has a new engine (with
zero miles), plus its original paint (orange with plaid interior); the other
has new paint (white in color), with green plaid interior. Super cool!
PRICE: $4000. (or best offer)
