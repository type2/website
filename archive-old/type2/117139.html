Subject: Re: [T2] cross drilled drums

this wasn't going to be a diy project by any means, i just wanted to see if
any of you have had it done or heard about it.  i think if done right it
wouldn't weaken the drum at all but that said, it is not something i'll
just be jumping into if it is feasable.  i'd be going to  a rod shop in so
cal where they have done it many times before and with good sucess.  i'm
going to a rod show this weekend so i'll see if any of the guys their have
done it.  so happens that this being so cal many of the rods are daily
drivers and also, many weigh much more than our little busses so would have
the same or greater strains placed on the drums.  we'll see, hopefully i
have something good to report on monday.  btw, the rod show is at mayfair
highschool in lakewood on sunday.  if my bus was ready i'd take her.  i
plan on taking her to quite a few rod shows next year after completion as
camper busses get some neat looks from the rod guys.

I'd be a little more than leery about DIY changes to brake
components...Cross
drilled rotors are not a DIY project and I tend to think drilling holes on
a
brake
drum might fail into the same catagory...How many holes? How large? What
would the spacing be before the benefits of cooling are undermined by the
weakening of the drum...That said, I did modify Datsun 240 Z rear drums to
fit my Morgan...Sort of a latter day &quot;Alfin&quot; upgrade... :-)
