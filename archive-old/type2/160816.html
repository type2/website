Subject: Removing heaterboxes, fan and other heater stuff

  I pulled the engine(2.0L IV) out of my 77 westy this past week to  
check some problems I have been having with oil leaks and compression  
problems. Well there was an ugly mess inside of her, so I'm going to  
be calling bus depot in the morning for a new longblock. Anyways my  
heater boxes and all of the related tubing under the rest of the van  
are in horrible shape. I live in San Diego and never need them, so  
I'm thinking about cutting the boxes off and leaving just the  
internal pipes. Will this be ok? Do the heater boxes help divert some  
of the hot exhaust temps away from the engine? What about the  
auxiliary fan in the engine compartment, if I remove my heater  
equipment is that necessary or does that help blow air over the  
cylinders?

  I understand that those old vw dudes put stuff in there for a  
reason, and I don't always see the reason on my first look or even  
seventh and eighth.

Thanks
-Chris
