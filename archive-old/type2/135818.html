Subject: Hippie Fix 1 - Oil Cap 0

Ok, I teased about this in my Denver thread... 

12 miles from the exit I needed to get to my final destination (the
hotel I'll be in for 3 weeks) I stopped for gas and checked the oil. I
opened the engine compartment and EVERYTHING was covered in oil!

The oil cap had blown off, and pieces of it were in the fan.   

There's no way I'll find an oil cap and that's NOT something I brought
a spare of. Grr...

Went into the gas station to see if I could come up with a solution to
my conundrum. I didn't mind doing a Hippie Fix since I was so close to
the hotel. The only thing I could find was a 6-pack of hose clamps
with 3 missing for $3. One looked big enough to get around the filler
opening. So I grabbed that, but couldn't decide on what to use to
actually cover the opening. Duct tape! I've got lots of that with me!

It got me to the hotel. And it's still there! Now I can hunt down a
proper cap...
