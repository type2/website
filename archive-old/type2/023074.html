I agree with everything that Kevin said but wanted to add my own two 
cents.  The most important thing to think about is, &quot;What are you going to 
do with this bus?&quot;  My opinions follow.

If you're primarily going to restore it and drive it to shows, go for a 67 
or earlier split window.
If you're going to drive it frequently, get a post-67 (including Vanagon) 
as visibility and ride quality are vastly improved.
If you're going to camp frequently, get a Vanagon as it has the most 
intelligent interior layout and most interior room.
If you're concerned about long-term reliability, get a fuel-injected model 
(75-later or 74 automatic).

The earlier the model, the more nostalgic it is obviously and the more 
attention it will draw.
As a general rule, the later the model, the more 
powerful/comfortable/reliable it is.
You'll have to balance those last two depeding on what is most important to 
you.

For myself, I primarily wanted a bus to camp in, so I picked one with an 
interior that I liked (Safare highroof).  I ruled out Vanagons because my 
nostalgia-quotient is moderately strong - only a bay or split would be 
acceptable.  I had to rule out splits though because of their harsh ride 
and lack of interior space.  Since I average about 12,000 miles per year in 
my bus, I also wanted reliability and economy.  I had to sacrifice that 
initially as my bus has dual carbs, but I am collecting parts for a FI 
conversion.

If you care more about decent heat, power and a quiet engine than 
nostalgia, consider one of the 2.1l Vanagons (86 and up I believe).  Make 
sure it has been meticulously maintained and pay careful attention to the 
radiator fluid and cylinder heads.  I know many people who are long-term 
owners of this setup and are happy with it.
