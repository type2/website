Subject: Re: acceptable torque wrench tolerances

&gt;It is one of those ones that clicks when you reach the preset torque. Anyway,
&gt;I got it home and read the blurb, and noticed that the tolerance on it was
&gt;plus or minus 4%. The torque ranges from 10 - 150 ft-pounds.
&gt;
&gt;I am wondering if this is acceptable, because (unmechanically inclined as I
&gt;am) I would have thought that was a pretty high error range.

The beam ones aren't calibrated all that finely, either--the little lines
are pretty close together and the line on the indicator is pretty blunt,
etc. Four percent doesn't seem like that much to me.

But there's a lot you can't see with a clicker. A lot of times torque is
not as orderly as you might think. If you're, say, squishing a head gasket
on a monoblock, those bolts can reach a given torque and then hold it even
when you continue turning a half turn or even more. There can be a helluva
lot of rotation between 30 ft/lbs and 31, but you'll never know it if your
think clicks at 30 and you stop right there.

With lighter values, like 15-30 ft/lbs, I take it to mean &quot;one hair less
than 16-31&quot;. A beam can make a substantial difference in a situation like
that.

BUT there are times when it would be very, very nice not to have to have my
face in front of the danged thing, which is an advantage you do have.
