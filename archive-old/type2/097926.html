Subject: Re: [T2] Stored Engine Starup Question

&lt;&lt; So I'm getting ready to install the engine into the 69 westy I've been

restoring. The engine is out of another bus that was crunched up front. As

of six years ago it ran great. So, should I do anything special before

starting it up? I was thinking about pulling the heads off and squirting

some oil around the pistons and rings and whatnot... My partner on the job

just wants to spray some WD-40 in the spark plug holes and fire it up. What

do you all suggest?

Whatever lube you use for the cylinders, the other chronologically-
challenged car lists I'm on recommend pulling the plugs (no com-
pression), no gas to the carb/FI, and spinning the engine on the
starter to pump the oil pressure up to pre lube the motor before
starting it under power.
