Volks -

Even if the entire front end won't fit, you can still install the '71 parts
from the spindles out. You won't have vacuum assist, but it'll still be
better than the drums.

I have a '71 front-end sitting in the garage for just that conversion, but
can't talk myself into having different wheels front and rear (unless
there's a rear conversion nobody has mentioned?).

&gt; He told me that sometime in '69, they switched the
&gt; bolt-pattern (the bolts that hold the beam to the
&gt; body, not lug-studs), and that the later ones fit, but
&gt; not the early. We checked mine and....no go. In order
&gt; to make the change to disks, I'd have to swap-out the
&gt; shafts themselves and have the master-cylinder bracket
&gt; welded onto my existing beam.
