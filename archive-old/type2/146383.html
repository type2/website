&gt;Just had 1.7 liter rebuilt by Boston Bob' s Long block (he did a nice job) .
&gt;Question is , the clutch that was with the engine before it was rebuilt looks
&gt;preety darn good  (total thickness is .350&quot;. Is it a rule of thumb to replace
&gt;clutch when history of existing clutch is not known. Thanks

What is the depth from the surface to the highest rivet?
