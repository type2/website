Subject: exhaust change over

I posted this a couple of days ago but didn't really hear back.  I am
thinking of changing my stock 78 exhaust system to a 72-74 style.  I
want to hear from someone who has actually done this to hear how it
worked out, if all the sheet metal works and the heat channels line up
and connect.
