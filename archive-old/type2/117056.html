Subject: 78' Westy Fridge Question

So I got it all wired up. Aux battery relay reconnected after PO snipped
wires to remove Battery. Got the cooked transformer replaced and turned on
the fridge with the city power selected. Lights lit up and the coils got
hot. Let it run all night. This morning I went out to see if my beer was
cold and the part inside the fridge was still room temperature. The light
was still on and the coils were still hot but no go on the cold. I am
certain the unit has not been run in many years. Is it likely that it it
toast from sitting or does the amonia or what ever just take a day or so to
come back to life? I am sort of guessing the amonia is gone or this unit it
shot for some other reason, but besides the snipped wires in the relay area
everything looked pristine. Did not look like the coils had been messed
with and all the insulation was intact. Any ideas here???
