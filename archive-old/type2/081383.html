Subject: Re: [T2] Shocks

Hey Steve, regarding front shock replacement, reminds me of my 71- the upper
front shock mount is on top of a &quot;tower&quot; on the front beam that rusted on my
bus- I scrounged a four sided road sign that had been run over, cut out a
section (it has a neat row of holes all along the sides) and gas welded it
to the old cutoff tower.  Worked fine; it's still on the retired 71 Westy in
the woods.  The rest of the post got used on my tractor as a crossbar on the
pto lift.
