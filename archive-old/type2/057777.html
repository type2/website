Subject: '76 VW Bus Parting Out in Seattle

Greetings,

	I will be moving house in three weeks and have no place to store the
parts bus that has been supporting my other two.  It is a '76, avacado
colored standard bus.  Before it goes, I am going to pull the engine and
tranny and replace the rims, but the rest of the bus is open to be stripped
of any usable parts.  Price will be whatever you want to offer.  There is a
very good middle seat, and a good rear seat and one of those plastic spare
tire covers.  Or, someone may want to buy the whole bus (minus
engine/tranny) make me an offer.  If anything is left the weekend of the
12th, I will probably be offering it to the &quot;Bug Haus&quot;, up the street from
my house.  

	Call me up and let me know if you are interested:   (206)546-8019,
or email me at my hotmail account:  psmall_at_hotmail_dot_com and include &quot;VW&quot; in
the subject line.

Peter Small
