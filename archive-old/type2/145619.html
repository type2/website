  ok heres where i am finally....

i need to know if i can still use this same arm if i have it tack welded?

this is only a temp thing till i can find another bus or another front end.

reason i ask is i was able to get the ball joint to pop back in with lots of effort of course into the arm again as it was before... now i know the arm has got to be really loose or else it would not have popped out. Si if i have it tack welded and of course i will have to have to towed just to have it tack wedled but can this be done.

i mean all the other three are tack welded correct?

If so then what i will do is when taken to have tack welded i will get all the others tapped up good again also if i can. that way its done....

now again this will be temp until i can get another front end or another bus one.

i am looking everyday and got wanted stuff everywhere and people looking for me.
74-79 camper hopefully FI...... but the most part a front end.

heres the pics

this was not easy to get it all lined back up but i did it and it is not back in the arm again....
