Try the following: (I got the same problem- due to rust, the metal
between the holes tends to &quot;arch&quot; and the hole inside the pipe tends to
enlarge.)- 1. Grind the flanges of the upipes as flat as you can and
still have a bite for the bolts. 2. Use doubled up exhaust gaskets. 3.
If the stock gaskets are too narrow for they sit against (inside edge)
then get some heat proof gasketing sheets from your FLAPS, trace the
location of the holes, and cut the inside hole slightly smaller.  Use
stainless steel bolts to replace the old.  I got 1/4&quot; s.s. ones from
hardware store.  Works for me.  If you need heat exchangers soon, get
the 74 kind with the manifold connections built in, bypass any need for
upipes or manifold.
