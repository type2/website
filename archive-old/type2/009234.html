1974 Westfalia(Orange)

Body in Great Condition. It has a minor dent
in back whre it was rearended. The Interior is in good condition as far
as the back bed and top bed are concerned. The front seats have fuzzy
seat covers over them..very comfortable. It runs great. I just had
a new clutch installed. The sink, stove and frig are
there but not hooked up. I was told they worked but
have'nt tried them out. THIS BUS RUNS GREAT!!!
It needs: Carpet for front and back and Pop Top Canvas.
Also has a new paintjob.

$2500

1976 Westfalia(School Bus yellow)

Great bus..Interior is in excellent condition. All seats are covered
with the original plaid interior. The sink works great. It has an
icebox. Under 10,000 miles
on new breaks, new tires, new engine, and new am/fm cassettee and
speakers. A little rust here and there but nothing major. It could use
some attention under the rear bumper but other than that this is a good
solid bus with a new paintjob. Newly installed: Gas tank, altenator,
batter cable, and sink pump. Runs fantastic!

$5500 OBO

Both buses are located in Georgia. Email me if interested.
