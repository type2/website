&gt;Is it ridiculous to think these emails might be being stored somewhere 
&gt;through Type2 - e.g. archives or the like - so that I don't have to store 
&gt;all this now, in case I need such info later?  I'm obviously not very savvy 
&gt;about the workings of cyberspace...but I don't want to delete things I might 
&gt;want to know about later!

&gt;Also, can anyone explain to me why I just got a failure notice saying I 
&gt;quoted too much, when I didn't quote anyone?  I'm sure I&quot;m misunderstanding 
&gt;the comment, but it's confusing...

Too must quoted text, like the above paragraph lines starting with &quot;&gt;&quot; gets barfed back to you by the list.
