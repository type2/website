Just wanted to post the answer to this question as I received three of them
direct to my mailbox. The next person will be able to search for the answer :)

The combo city water/pump inlet faucet is avail from 3 sources:
Bus Boys _at_ $72.95
Go Westy _at_ $69.95
Bus Depot _at_ $64.95

Never found a source just for parts.
