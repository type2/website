Subject: Introduction

Hello all, my name is Eric I'm new to the list.  I live in Sacramento, 
CA, and drive a bone stock '68 Westy.  (I previously had a '69 camper 
(no poptop) that I cut my teeth on.)  I've had my bus I think since 
1996.  I do all the maintenance and most repairs on it myself, but have 
been taking it in to a mechanic for larger repairs and the few times 
I've been stumped recently due to time getting sucked into a mystery 
vacuum by 2 small children.  This bus has been from Sacramento, CA to 
Guanajuato, Mexico and back, including several side trips to the 
Pacific Ocean (Nayarit and Michoacan) when I was down there.  All of 
which is to say that it has treated me very very well and I in turn try 
to &quot;be kind to my ass for it bears me&quot;.

Current to-dos: (1) fix the accelerator pedal linkage (basically get it 
ship shape because I'm only getting a little more than half throttle, 
which interestingly enough, will let me cruise at 65mph/3000rpm); (2) 
figure out why the interior light by the back bench seat isn't working; 
(3) experiment with electronic ignition gizmo in an 009 distributor 
(I've got the stock vacuum advance distributor in there now, and 
purchased the electronic ignition on a recommendation; had an 009 
laying around in the garage).  I've been enjoying the tech archive and 
library this evening and look forward to more education from the list 
serve and website, in addition to sharing what meager knowledge I have 
myself.

Kind regards, -e
