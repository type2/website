Hey-

Friday subject, here. Anybody see &quot;Law and Order&quot; last
Wednesday? It showed a splittie (sans widows and most
everything else) being pulled from the East river. Sad,
yes...but in a sick and perverse way, still cool to see
as the entire episode revolved around a bus.

Also brought back a few memories of driving my (first)
'69 bus into a lake in central Idaho and sinking it
(mental note: when drinking wine, NEVER listen when
your buddy tells you to drive off the end of the boat
ramp)! 

Remember those old commercials showing a bug floating
for hours in the water??? Ever wonder why they *never*
showed a bus in the same circumstances?! Because busses
DON'T FLOAT!!!!

Ok, a word in my defense...I was young (19) and
dumb(er) and the lake was a crater lake and there was a
STEEP dropoff at the end of the ramp!

Incidentally, that bus was painted canary yellow and
had previously been dubbed &quot;the Yellow Submarine&quot;.
Never let someone tell you words and names don't have
immense power.....just look what happened to my bus! 


Good Friday All!

PS-Woke up to a foot of snow this AM...was great fun
driving around town when only snow plows shared the
road (cowards!).

Jaime
