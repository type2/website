Yes, it is still mechanical, apparently the last few months production of
the 77's went to hydraulic, mine was earlier than that.

 

Take care,

...snip,.................congrats!!

 

Other than less maintenance, is there any real reason to switch this engine

over to hydraulic valves?

....................I thought the 77's had hydraulics....... I have a 76

with solid lifters and thought they went to hydraulics in 77. Are you sure

it doesn't have them already? Doyt
