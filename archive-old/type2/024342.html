&gt; we stopped by and looked at 1970 westy the other day. looked pretty
&gt; clean. . . . wiper motor
&gt; doesn't work . he doesn't know whats on motor rebuild as done by PO but
&gt; says has power loss and gas in oil. 

Any bites on this one, my '70 came with an extra wiper motor/tranny. Free plus shipping, or trade for tin I need. looks like you will need a fuel pump too. I have an extra one, not free but we can talk.
