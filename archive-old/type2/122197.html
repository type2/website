Subject: Re: gas mileage

Steevo,
The 1.8L FI in my '75 Westy has consistently produced 20-21 mpg at an 
average of about 55-60 mph. With a 2.0L FI and unstated mph it is hard to 
know if your 15-16 is reasonable or not. What average mph were you logging? 
Aside from examining the plugs, you might want to check the timing and dwell 
angle, tire pressures, and any signs of dragging brakes to see if you can 
increase it a bit.
Roland
