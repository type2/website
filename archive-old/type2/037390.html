Kool, Jeff...

I did re-wire my radio to an 'always on' bus in my fuse box. Same one that 
runs the emergency flasher.  I am looking to get it to run off the accessory 
bus.

Yes, a buzzer for the parking lights would work!!  But what do I connect it 
to??  I have a 'ding dong' for my key, but I don't know to where/what I 
would connect the new warning alert.

&gt;In a message dated 00-03-21 08:08:40 EST, you write:

&gt;&lt;&lt; And the first guy who says 'wire the radio to the
&gt;  headlights' is going to get his head pushed in  ;-).
&gt;   &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;My, My, a little testy this morning? How are you doing? Wire your radio
&gt;directly to the battery, like mine is. 'Course then you'll leave the radio 
&gt;on
&gt;and run down your battery just like I do! You may want to wire in one of
&gt;those buzzers for the parking lights. Annoying, I know, but it may help to
&gt;remind you that they are on.    Jeff
