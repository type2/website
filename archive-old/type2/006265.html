As an Oz based van list member, the subject of Southern hemisphere transfers
is (of course) close to my heart ;^)

To refresh my memory, does the hubcap exchange have to be in the presence of
the donor and recipient vans? This would, of course, add a degree of
complication, as it would require two vans to &quot;go cruisin' &quot; (shipwise, that
is).

Anyone planning a world tour WITH their nearest &amp; dearest Teutonic(sp?) Time
Machine (&quot;age does not weary them, as we that are left grow old&quot;, you'll
have to come down here to find out what that line means).

Seriously, it would be good to have the rest of the Type 2 community
involved in the Hubcap Odessy(sp?), rather than it just being a North
American thing. I'm sure that I, as an Australian, would not be alone in
that, our Kiwi neighbours, and Asian, Middle Eastern, and European friends
up north would, I'm sure, also be interested in being involved.

Hopefully your's ;^)

Neale

&gt; &gt; There are some very *interesting* items in the tour box now.  Its a riot

&gt; &gt; drive (in my 71 bus - Stella) to meet the next recipients.  I'm sure
&gt;
&gt; Yeah it still is moving, Westward
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Where is this thing going to end up anyways?!  Maybe the History Channel
&gt; &gt; can do a documentary on it...8)
&gt;
&gt; my understanding was that it was going to try and be ended up at the VW
&gt; museum?!?!?!
&gt;  via Australia, NZ, Europe and anywhere inbetween that it could be figured
&gt; out how to get it to, now getting it to and from the Southern Hemisphere
&gt; could be a real trick!
