&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt; broken inlet spacer there seems to be a thin gasket on either side of the

&gt; are where do y'all get them from? Thanks.

they are paper like gaskets and I haven't used em in years don't think
they are avaliable anymore, I have never seen em. don't seem to have an
effect and there are no leaks
