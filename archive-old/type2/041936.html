&gt; I reckon that I need to do a spot of welding to my 73 bus.  Just
&gt; under the accellerator pedal the metal is giving way and I can see
&gt; the road :-(
&gt; 
&gt; But I need to know what type of welder to get.  MIG ??? TIG ???
&gt; etc etc

The easiest welder for someone new to welding is a MIG welder. In the US
there is a nice little wirefeed welder called a Lincoln Weld-Pak 100 that
has an optional MIG gas setup. (Lincoln Electric sells worldwide, so you
should be able to get this welder in Britain.) Get both of those, some MIG
wire, a roll of flux-core wire, some scrap steel and a tank of argon and
start practicing.

Additional things you're going to need: a heavy denim jacket with a button-
up collar, welder's gauntlets (very heavy leather gloves), a decent helmet
because the one that Lincoln gives you with the welder is worth every pence
you paid for it, a slag hammer and a wire brush.

Why both kinds of wire? When you're welding along on a day the welding
stockist is closed and run out of argon, you'll be very happy that you can
change tips on the torch, spools on the wire feeder, and go back to welding.
