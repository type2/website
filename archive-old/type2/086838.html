Subject: Re: [T2] gas tanks

Billy,

If you clean it now, I would clean it, dry it with a hair dryer and then
dump a couple of quarts of oil in it and slosh the oil around real well.

Make sure it is very dry before you do this and then seal it very well.

Might keep rust from forming on the inside before you get gas back in it.

Slosh again every couple of months.

Just an idea, dave

&gt; &gt;Yes, it's biodegradable.
&gt; 
&gt; as I stated, my tank's pretty clean for starters, but the bus it came out of is a year from being roadworthy. will marine clean be all I need to do the tank, and what about the tank sitting for a year, should I do something to it first?
&gt; 
&gt; thanks to all,
