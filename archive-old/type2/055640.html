&gt;  sound like the original or should I hold off till I find a Hella?

Hi Ed

Most of the horns sold by your FLAPS will be positive switched self earthing
gizzmos.

Hella or generic, high or low tone, VW sound or other squeek you will need one
capable 
of cohabiting with the VW horn which is not self earthing and is negative
switched.

Good luck
Bob
