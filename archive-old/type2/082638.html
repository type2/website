Subject: Re: [T2] Re:repair reservoir

Paul, YES! Thank you. This i will try first. Maybe you overkilled by
reinforcing the stuff is damn strong when its not cracked.


&gt; Andy and Listees,
&gt;    You asked....&quot;has anyone ever fixed a cracked brake fluid reservoir.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;    I've got to go against the list wisdom on this one.  When we got our '71
&gt; the brake reservoir was cracked and leaking and I couldn't find one new or
&gt; used.  I decided that I didn't have anything to loose by trying a repair as
&gt; I wouldn't use the reservoir as it was anyway.
&gt;    I used a low wattage(15 watts I think), pencil type soldering iron to
&gt; melt the plastic of the reservoir.  First thing was to thoroughly clean the
&gt; reservoir inside and out with the last step being a water rinse.  After the
&gt; reservoir was completely dry I attempted the repair.
&gt;   I used the soldering iron to melt the plastic at the crack using a
&gt; circular motion, like when you weld.  Make sure the &quot;melt&quot; goes as deep as
&gt; possible and isn't just on the surface.  This left a depression along the
&gt; length of the crack.  Then I used the iron to melt and move plastic from the
&gt; surrounding area to fill in the depression.  Be patient with this as it
&gt; doesn't happen very fast.  Then I let the whole thing cool off.  All of this
&gt; left a very uneven surface on the reservoir.  I used course sandpaper to
&gt; smooth off the high spots so that I could add reinforcement to the outside
&gt; of the reservoir.  As a reinforcement I cut a piece of fiberglass window
&gt; screen the size and shape of that side of the reservoir.  Then I put a layer
&gt; of a product known as proseal on the reservoir and embedded the reinforcing
&gt; screen into it.   I put it aside for a couple of days, giving the proseal a
&gt; chance to thoroughly set. Proseal is a product used in aviation, it's a
&gt; sealant that,when dry, is flexible, and is resistant to a host of solvents
&gt; and chemicals.  You might be able to find a good sealant in a marine store.
&gt;    Anyway, I did that repair over 2 years ago and that reservoir hasn't
&gt; leaked a drop since.  But yes, I do still check on it to make sure it's
&gt; holding up.
&gt;
