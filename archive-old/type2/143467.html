Subject: Question about VW Buses for Sale

I'm selling my VW Bus, and sometime ago, I was directed to a VW Bus Web Site 
where you can post listings of busses for sale, particularly for folks who are 
serious about busses.   Does anyone know about this web site, and if so, 
could you send me their URL address?    Thanks!
