Subject: Re: [T2] Vehicles in Japan and Thailand (Friday)

Well, I edited the links and filenames to make sure all the links in the 
page work...

http://rpalomera.home_dot_comcast_dot_net/vehicles/

Thanks for bringing that to my attention!
If you download the videos (they are in spanish), I want to apologize for 
their big size, but Adobe Premiere
doesn't recognize their coding so I can't edit them to make them smaller...

Regards,

&gt;Rogelio, you need to edit the links to the full-size pictures on this page
&gt;so that the file names are all lowercase.  ComCast's servers are case
&gt;sensitive and the links won't work with the uppercase characters in them.
