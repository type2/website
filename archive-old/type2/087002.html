&gt; Two questions, one email:

&gt; 1. Has anyone tried fabbing an undercarriage storage compartment? There's
&gt; tons of room under there and it would be nice to keep my jack stands, jack,
&gt; tools, spare parts outside of the bus.

I stored my spare tire on my 71 there just used a long bolt with big
flange washers through hole in the floor. used a jack to put it in place,
the one time I needed it came right out
