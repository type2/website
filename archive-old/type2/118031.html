Subject: Death at idle - the answer is..

Hey y'all
The answer was the idle cutout solenoid was missing the big fat washer that
is supposed to be there.  Ed tried unscrewing the idle solenoid instead of
adjusting the idle screw and she started to idle!

I shoulda thought the washer was missing while it was apart, but I arrived to
a partially disassembled carb to begin with, and I don't mess with 34s much
anyhow, though the 30s have the same setup.

Thanks for all the answers folks 2 of 3 replies were the correct answer, Greg
and Mark!

Thanks again, y'all are great!

Mad Uncle Dave
