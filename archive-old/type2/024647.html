Subject: FS sighting in Half Moon Bay, Ca
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

A '69 HT parked in a lot just east of HMB on Hwy 92.
Body looks straight although a quick &quot;thump around&quot; and the homedone primer
grey tells me theres some bondo in there. Underneath looks clean.
Interior looks clean in front but there's nothing in the back. Probably a
good project.
Engine needs some TLC (the note says its a 1600 dp with PIC 28 carb) but
its sporting a type I muffler (gasp..cough..)
Asking price is $1500 Phone number 650-728-7203
Thats as much as I know about it.
Bob
