&gt; Hello All, I've replace master cylinder of 70 Bus and now I am having LOTS
of
&gt; trouble bleeding brakes.  I can't seem to get all of air out of master
&gt; cylinder and brake lines

Been there, done that big time.  Replaced hoses, MC, and wheel cylinders on
my 70, and went thru 3 qts, of brake fluid trying to bleed.  With help from
the almighty list I learned you must:
1. Adjust brakes.
2. Bleed brakes.
3. Adjust brakes again, maybe a tad tight.
4. Bleed brakes again.
5  Back off adjustment if necessary.
Assuming you have no air leaks, that should do it, it worked for me.
