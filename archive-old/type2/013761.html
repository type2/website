Hello List,

If by chance, any one was trying to reach me today or
late last night, my email was down but i am now
receiving emails. 

Has any one ever had a problem with their bus not
starting after the engine was washed. she turns over
but woln't fire. I pluged up the intake and all other
voids. I figured that I got the points wet but it has
been 3 days. any one had this happen. the only thing i
know to do is mark the distributor and take the cap
off and air blow it out. Then I will check to see if
it has spark.
Thanks for all of your help!
