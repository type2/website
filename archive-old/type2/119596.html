&gt;Can anyone in the group give me a good description of what the retard side
&gt;of my dual distributor does - right now it is disconnected

It retards the timing from a number like 7.5 BTDC down to 5 ATDC to reduce the emissions at idle. As the rpms increase of idle the retard quickly goes away and the advance part of the can kicks in.

&gt; I want to know
&gt;if I leave it this way do I still time it too 5 ATDC - Should I reconnect
&gt;it? What does it do ?

If it's not connected you should time it to 7.5 BTDC unless you find a setting between that and zero (TDC) that works better.
