Subject: Re: DIY tent patterns

Some tips on using an old canvas as a pattern to make a new one:

1. Get a device called a seam ripper. It's useful for quickly and 
cleanly taking the old seams apart

2. To start, cut the old canvas exactly in half, along the long axis. 
Why? This gives you all of the pattern parts (once you take the seams 
out of one side). The end pieces will be half-patterns. You will fold 
the new material in half, place the cut edge against the folded edge, 
and cut. The other reason for this cut-in-half strategy is that you'll 
still have an example of all of the seams intact. It's easy to forget 
exactly how the thing should go together.

3. Unless you use a coated fabric (and you probably shouldn't) for the 
new tent, pin the old piece to the new and cut. Be sure to match the 
bias (the direction in which the fabric stretches the most) from old to 
new.

4. Roberto is exactly right about shrinkage, washing, ironing, etc.
