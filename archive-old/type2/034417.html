Subject: Re: diesel

Steve-
          ...The idea is to have a quart or so of diesel at hand, and with 
the engine running
quite fast, pour the quart, slowly through the carb. The process is used to 
remove car-
bon deposits (de-coking, as it is called in my British car manuals), from the 
combustion
chambers. It didn't work that well, as I recall, when the head was finally 
removed. 
          I doubt that a tank-full would be any more beneficial and I 
certainly wouldn't try
it through expensive fuel injectors...
