Subject: Re: [T2] Heat: Atwood Bilge Blower?

From: &quot;Snoopy&quot; &lt;vwsnoopy_at_knology_dot_net&gt;
&gt; But everyone don't forget.... The over the engine fan does nothing at all
above idle!!!  The system is not designed to.  A bilge blower installed here
would just waste your money once the bus is moving.  The engine fan takes
over after idle and that is your source of air.

Does the system cut off the circulating air completely, or can you force air
through the system?  I thought that the fan over the engine ran regardless
of whether you were at idle or road speed, as long as you turned it on.

&gt; I highly recommend a CO detector and have it installed in my bus.  Saved
my puppies lives once already...  And maybe mine one day...

Not a bad idea at that, Snoopy.  Got to get one for our bus.
