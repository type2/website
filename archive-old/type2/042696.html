auto transmission starters are different.  (there has been a lot of
argument on this list as to how interchangable they are) I have switched
em sometimes with good results other have had different experiences

if the gears match up and if the starter sticks far enough out to engage
the flywheel then it &quot;Should&quot; work but as they say
your mileage may vary YMMV
