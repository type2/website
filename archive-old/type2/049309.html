 hay Steve,
 i believe if you have the last owner do a title search through the dmv
 they can find it for you for about $50.00
 but you might also have to pay if the bus has not been on the road for some 
time in cali. 
 this could cost you some bread
 i had a 69 transporter that was off the road for a year and it cost me $85.00
 to renew the tags
 .
 no busses in the barn yet
  rob   weare NH
