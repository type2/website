Subject: carb questions

i thought that it would be easier to just take a picture and let you guys 
see it. then you would know what i was talking about. Also i just got a new 
toy and i had to put it to use. thanks.


oh yeah. one more question. on #1 in the picture... when i unscrew it and 
take it out, how much fuel will come out? thats it for now.
