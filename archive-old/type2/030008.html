&gt; &gt; Why, since bridgestone makes the RD603 in the correct size, did you go

&gt; &gt; opted for the common &quot;replacement&quot; suggestion.  Enquiring minds...

&gt; Because after having run the numbers so many times, the height difference
&gt; between a 'properly' sized 195/75R14 and a 185R14 was negligable enough,
&gt; to me, to justify the extra width.

OK, second question.  Why do you want more width?  

Off-roaders want width
for flotation, and high-performance folk want width to spread the
frictional heat of prolonged high power and high cornering loads, but a
bus presents neither of these problems, unless you're sand-duning in your
bus.  I've done a lot of off-pavement driving in my bus and only been
stuck once (in a sandy riverbed where a Baja bug managed to get stuck as
well).  When you've got 4000 pounds sitting on little wheels you do need
to be conservative when the going gets loose, but an extra inch of tread
width won't do much to help.

Disadvantages of wide tires include increased stress on the bus' rather
fragile steering box and steering linkage when turning the wheels at a
standstill and decreased fenderwell clearance for chains and debris
clearance.

Low profile tires don't last any longer than conventional tires or carry
greater loads.  They aren't any better for traction either, except in the
case of prolonged high power or cornering loads situation that I mentioned
earlier.

I guess the there is a certain &quot;kewl&quot; factor to low profile tires, but 75
series tires just aren't that impressive in a 50 and 40 series world.
