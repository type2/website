Subject: Aux Battery relay...

Hi Guys,

    I have found the original Bosch aux battery relay in the engine 
compartment of my '72 dormobile.. It has 5 terminals - 
http://www.neuro-net.co_dot_uk/relay.jpg...

All the terminals are connected as expected 30 to primary battery positive, 
87 to auxillary battery positive, 86 to regulator and 30 to earth... But I 
do not know where 87b is supposed to connect (someone has severed the cable 
!)... 87 + 87b are both connected when the ignition is on and both 
disconnected when the ignition is off ? Any ideas ?
I think the relay is setup so that when the ignition is on both batterys 
charge.... Then when the ignition is off the relay is open... Does this mean 
that items that I want to run when the ignition is off need to be wired to 
the auxillary battery ?

Cheers

Dave K.
