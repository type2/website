Subject: Burnt Exhaust valve?

 Hello All. I have a 77 auto westy with a 1.8 dual carbed that is having trouble. I have a dead miss on cylinder 2. The plug is a nice brown color, the ign system is up to par. I pulled the ign wires off the cap until I came to the one that had no effect. I pulled the plug out and grounded it and it fired nicely. I adjusted the valves and the exhaist and intake valve on the number 2 cylinder were tight. The other 3 were good to go. I've never had any expierence with burnt valves so I don't know what their symptoms are. I'm asking if this sounds like a possibilty before I go to pulling the head off. I have not done a compression test as of yet but that is next on the list as well. Any ideas? Thanks in Advance.
