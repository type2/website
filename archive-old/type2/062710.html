Subject: Re: Paint it yourself

IMHO, most people are far better off investing their energy and time in doing
the prep work and then letting a cheap shop do the paint. It may be drudge
work but nothing will do more to ensure a satisfactory end product. As with
most things related to vw's, the only way to get your moneys worth and get
the job right is to do much of it yourself. 

I had an experience with Maaco in Omaha years ago with an MG on which I had
done some Bondo work. They painted it for roughly $300 but wanted a premium
for painting over somebody elses work and refused to guarantee their work as
a result. The paint bubbled up in a different area within months.

On another occaision, I pulled a CJ5 fully stripped into Earl Scheib for
their &quot;any car for $149.99&quot; special. Fact is, they don't want to do any car
at that price. They declared it a van/utility vehicle and wanted $300. See
ya!

I think $300 is a general price target and I don't mind paying it but I hate
being bait and switched or otherwise taken for a moron.

Now I've done 4 cars in Atlanta at Econo-Autopaint which I think is a chain
deal. Big difference in attitude with Gary who's been there 20 years. Yeah,
he'd prefer to do the body work but he also recognizes that when I put effort
into it I expect a good job in return. Each time we price one, he always asks
if I'm keeping the car or selling it to determine what level of paint etc.
The jeep we did at $180 and the Vanagon with the highend paint at $300
including some minor bodywork. After 5 years the rust is back in those
ridiculous jeep fenders way before the paint shows any sign of fading. 

My point is that if you invest in prep work and find an experienced shop to
shoot the paint at a price fair to both, I think it is probably difficult to
get better value by attempting it youself. Unless of course you just happen
to have the equipment and want that experience or you really are good with
refrigerator enamel and a brush.
