Subject: Getting the AC working in my '76 (long)

I currently purchased a '79 Bus from a fellow listee. The idea was to use it 
for parts on my '76. A PO (not the fellow listee) removed the FI and 
installed a single carb. Now it doesn't run very well.
Anyways... One part I did not expext to get was a complete AC system, minus 
the compressor. It is the overhead unit shaped like a T. The Bus was 
purchased in Oklahoma and the AC unit has an OK company name on it (can't 
remember the name). In the process of removing the FI, the compressor was 
removed and never returned (the hoses where just cut off at the compressor). 
All other parts seem to be there.

I visited the type2 library and archives to try and get as much info as 
possible. The article by David Schwarze is very helpful.

SO... Here's my questions:
1) (I may regret asking this one)
Is it worth transferring the AC system to my '76. I get varrying opinions 
from the list archive/library. I use the '76 as my daily driver and like it 
to have all the bells and whistles. Would only use it 2 months out of the 
year as I live in Seattle. I think it would be &quot;cool&quot; (no pun intented) to 
have AC in my Bus.

2)Where could I get a compressor? IS I.C.E in San Diego a good place? I have 
sent them a request for info but have not heard back yet. I would also like 
to get all new hoses as the current ones are probably original.

3) Some of the wiring is disconnected. Where could I get a wiring diagram to 
make sure I hook it all back up right?

Thanks in advance for any help,

Ted Browning in Seattle
'76 Bus (purchased new by my Dad)
'79 Bus (recently purchased for parts but has a better body than my '76 so I 
may get it working, or maybe not, or... decisions, decisions) sigh :&gt;)
