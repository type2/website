I'm finishing up rebuilding my 110K engine out of my 83 Westfalia.
I'm running an 8K engine that I took out of an 81 Vanagon right now.
I want to sell the 8K engine and I'm willing to deliver it most anywhere
in the US to the purchaser.
If you want it with the sheet metal and turnkey to drop in as a
conversion I can supply that as well complete with injection system and
good 4 speed tranny.
Drop me a note if you're in the market, I will take your dead engine as a
core as long as it isn't locked up.
I'll send complete details about the 8K engine. I rebuilt it so I've got
all the details. I also rebuilt the 110 K engine that I'm rebuilding
again so I have no doubt that the engine is exceptional. I would consider
leaving the engine in the van and letting you drive before you pay if
you're within 250 miles radius from Dallas. TX.
You are also invited to come to Dallas from wherever and test drive this
engine before I take it out in about ten days.
It all comes down to; I'm going to get out of Dallas for about two to
three weeks and make a roadtrip for myself and break-in the new engine.
If you're located someplace I'd like to go I'll consider that in pricing
the engine.
