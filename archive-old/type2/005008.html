Get new clips.  It's cheap insurance.  I made the mistake of reusing some
and lost a chunk of adornment from my motorcycle.  Worse, it was a pure
unobtainium casting  &lt;:(

&gt; I tried to replace the chrome molding on the 68 a couple days ago and the
&gt; chrome snapped on, but was loose.  Do I need to get new clips or can the
old
&gt; be recycled?
