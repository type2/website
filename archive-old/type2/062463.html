Subject: Re: Oil Cleanup 

&gt;What should I use to clean up the garage floor (cement). I have dripped
&gt;a lot of oil on it.

Use &quot;Oil Dry&quot; or some &quot;cat litter&quot; stuff. They are basically the same stuff.
BTW: you can buy oil dry in 100lb bags way cheaper than cat litter. I've
been told by people who do this, that it works just a s good as cat litter
