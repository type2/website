Subject: accordion tubes

I am having fitment problems with the heater accordion tubes from the
flapper boxes to the Y on the body (74 Westy). The aftermarket
replacements that I got from CIP are at least four inches too long, and
the diameter of the ends is much too narrow - they barely fit over the
flapper boxes WITHOUT the seal. 

I have rubber later seals at the flapper boxes, and the original white
asbestos seal at the Y on the body. It appears that the accordion tubes
need to be, as I mentioned, a few inches shorter, and much wider diameter
at the ends, but it looks like there is only one part listed for this
application for all buses. 

Anyone had this problem before? Or had good success ordering these tubes
from a different vendor? The Bus Depot pictures appear to look closer to
the stock tubes. 

Thanks
