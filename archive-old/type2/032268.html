Subject: What a weekend!

Hello list-

It was a good weekend. The weather cooperated long enough for a head
&quot;retorqing&quot; and valve adjustment, and installation of the Bosch hard start
relay kit that Ron sells at the Bus Depot. (great little kit: designed
specifically for the VW, so all the connectors fit-no need for electrical
tape, etc.) The bus is now starting at the drop of a hat, and I am no
longer looking for clean parking spaces in which to park in case I have to
climb under with a screwdriver...

Went to a &quot;vintage junk shop&quot; on Saturday.. you know, a place that sells
all that old 60's and 70's clothes, toys and stuff. Struck up a
conversation with the owner about busses after I purchased the coolest bus
toy I've ever seen: a splitty record player. It's a little splitty bus
with a speaker on top and a needle on the bottom that literally drives
around your record. Bizzare! So, at some point I asked about a side tent
for a bus. Turns out he had one. At first we were talking a price around
$250. But this guy loves to barter. So after a long bartering session, I
get the tent for $25, and he gets my old VCR and old 486 laptop. Everyone
walked away happy! (I still have a grin on my face.)

It's a Westfalia tent, blue and yellow, with a striped awning. The tent is
in *perfect* shape, probably used once or twice. No mold, mildew or dirt!
Only the tent stakes are dirty. The blue is so blue! And the yellow is
so.... bright! The canvas on the bus used to be that color? Wow.. Just
tried to set the frame up without instructions, no go. Came in and looked
in the archives, found a reference to the Westy manual having the
instructions in it (kinda obvious now I that I think about it..) and dug
out our manual, and voila! Instructions. But now it's dark. I wonder if my
wife will let me set it up in the living room...

One question: in the Westy manual it talks about two tents: one a
&quot;Campertent - available in the USA&quot;. The other is a &quot;Campmobile Tent -
available in Canada and for Tourist Delivery Vehicles&quot;. Does anyone know
what the differences are between the tents? Our Westy is a Tourist
Delivery bus, and I believe the tent is the correct tent for the bus. The
tent comes in a blue bag, the poles in a yellow bag, and the instructions
are in the Westy manual. The manual doesn't have any instructions or
pictures of the &quot;Campertent&quot;, just says it comes in a zippered carrying
case and the instructions are packed with the tent. I'm just curious what
the differences are, if any.
