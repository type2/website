The only place I know of at the moment that hires out campers is
&gt; &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.google_dot_com/search?hl=en&amp;q=+site:www.100percentslow.co_dot_uk+100%25slow&quot;&gt;www.100percentslow.co_dot_uk&lt;/A&gt; there are plenty of vw air cooled garages in London 
&gt; and the south east of the UK . A lot of visitors to the uk would buy a 
&gt; camper for the length of there stay then sell it when it came time for them 
&gt; to leave. There is a &quot;Westy&quot; specialist in London. There are &quot;westys&quot; in 
&gt; the UK but there are a whole lot more home grown versions Devon, Dormobile, 
&gt; Danbury ETC ETC, so they are more commonly known as campers. 

 yours MEL 

Email me direct if I can be of any more help
