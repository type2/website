I was checking out my O2 sensor on my '79 CA bus and noticed
that the green wire from the wire harness is a coax cable. It appears
that the shield has been stripped back out of the way and only
the center conductor goes to a single wire from my O2 sensor.
Am I supposed to have a 2 wire O2 sensor? Is something wrong here?
