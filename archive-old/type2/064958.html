Subject: Subaru engines for $50? 

Dear Mark,

I'm intrigued by your discussion of putting a Subaru motor into a VW bus.
I drove an '86 Subaru GL wagon happily for 125000 miles before compression 
went to zero in one cylinder and I couldn't pass smog. At that time I shopped
around and learned that they are Hell to rebuild and make more sense to replace
outright. I found that many used ones were imported from Japan, but was told 
that by the time we get 'em often seals are dried out and various head gaskets 
and such leak and are Hell to fix. I couldn't find a used one for under $250,
with the above caveats promised. So I sold the car to Strictly Subarus in 
Escondido, CA for $200 and made my VW bus my primary car.

So where do you shop for motors? ANy problems like I was warned of?

Those engines will commonly go over 200,000 miles. 250,000 is not unheard of. I 
must have almost run it out of oil once or something. If I could get one for $50
and put it in my bus someday, I'd be real interested. I saw a similar 
conversion once with a Rabbit motor and radiator in the engine compartment 
venting out through a grill cut in the engine door. Can you tell me more
specifically what it takes to do this? They are a Helluva tight fit under the 
hood of a Subaru, but I guess the bus engine compartment is a bit roomier.
Purist would choke on their spittle in disbelief, but if the goal is reliable,
cost effective transportation and performance, then this could be a good thing.
Makes more sense than the ghastly Chevy 350 conversion I saw on a loaf once, 
with a huge radiator on the front bumper and a hideous cage on the back end to 
make room for the oversized engine.

Respectfully,
Surfer Bob
