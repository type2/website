Subject: Re: New Weber woes ....

Gary,

I have a Weber on my '77 and a buddy of mine had a Weber on his 72. Here are
my opinions:

&gt;I installed a new Weber today on my '72 with a 2.0L bus and I have to say
I'm not impressed &gt;with the setup.
&gt;The intake tubes don't line up with the carb manifold holes by 1/4 to 1/2
inch misalignment &gt;resulting on some stress on the connecting boots I don't
like. The quality of the intake tubes &gt;looks cheap.

The intakes are very thin metal compared to stock. Don't use the thick stock
intake gaskets or the intake tubes will not mesh with the carb manifold. Use
the thin gaskets that come with the carb kit. The thin tubes are easily
manipulated into the manifold - as long as they are long enough! Thin, yes.
Adaquate - also yes.

&gt;The directions require to throttle to be on the right side and the accel
cable ison the left side. I &gt;had to mount the carb backwards to get the
throttle to hook up.

The best solution is to re-route the cable to the other side of the engine.
On an FI engine, the carb/linkage/cable line up perfectly - although the
cable needed lengthening. On carbed engines - like your 72 - the stock
throttle cable does not come out where you would like it. Moving the cable
to the other side requires a bit of screwing around - i.e. making a smooth
entry thru the tin. It can be done! Good luck!

&gt;The plastic fitting supplied that screws into the carb manifold to hook up
the power brake &gt;booster hose was too big and I had to make something work
temporarily.

I used a length of bigger rubber tube - I was able to slip it over the carb
fitting and over the existing rigid plastic power brake tube.

&gt;I drove it about 10 miles to a parts store and back and there's some
pinging that wasn't there &gt;and the thing ran really hot. There's no place to
hook up the distributor vacuum retard. I'm  &gt;hinking the vacuum advance
isn't working.

I am running the stock vacuum dizzy - only one vacuum line for the '77. I
would recommend that you find a single vacuum dizzy. I don't think the carb
is set-up for the dual vacuum lines. My buddy went to a single vacuum dizzy
from a 009 and had good results. We both get around 20 mpg on road trips.

&gt;I'm wondering if they sold me the wrong carb.

Everything sounds consistant with my experiences. Sounds like the correct
carb.

&gt;Should this carb have fit better ?

Probably not. Between us, my buddy and I had all of the same issues. I
considered the carb conversion a rousing success. I've run mine for over 2
years and it works great. I never expected the conversion to be trouble free
and I was supprised at how easily it went for me. It's all in your
expectations I guess!

Best of luck and I hope I was able to provide some help,
