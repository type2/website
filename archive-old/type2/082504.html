Subject: Re: [T2] NOT sad news, but a question

&gt; Should the oil drain plug on a T4 motor have a washer (1977, original

Yes, it should.  I have seen many that do not, but it should.  Ideally, it
should have the rolled copper crush gasket like the late T1 drain kits
come with, but by times, they can be hard to find.  If you have a spare
drain plug (one of the benefits to being a junkyard addict is that you get
to pick up extraneous stuff like this :-), you can take it to a FLAPS and
they usually have a plastic washer that will do the job.  I am still
suspicious of these plastic things, not having entered fully into the
spirit of the second half of the 20th century, but they seem to work.

&gt; I noticed when draining it for the first time yesterday that it didn't
&gt; and I thought I remembered that the T1's did. I have an oil leak and
&gt; it looks like it's from around that plug and from the oil filter (new
&gt; filter didn't help). Note this is not the screen plate, but the oil
&gt; drain plug to the left of the screen plate.

Check!  IMHO, that is *the* place for which to drain oil!  I wish I owned
a 1/4&quot; drive torque wrench that would allow me to pull the screen more
often, but without it, I am leary of pulling the screen.  The torque spec
on the screen is very low and overtorquing it can lead to major problems.

&gt; Oh, and another question: what's that plate at the bottom of the oil
&gt; filler tube for? Looks like it's held on by 2 10mm bolts?

I think it is a &quot;casting artifact.&quot; As someone else mentioned, it is used
to install an oil temp sender (unless you have a friend like David
Schwarze who gives you a porsche plate with the sender installed :-), but
in normal use it need never come off unless it is leaking.

On your oil leak, there is a lot going on around the #4 cylinder corner of
the T4 engine.  The oil cooler is there, the oil pressure sender is there,
there is splash from a leaking rear main seal, and there is splash from
leaking push rod tubes on the 3/4 side of the engine.  My experience has
been that the most common cause of leaks in this corner (other than the
pushrods, which are just a &quot;fact of life&quot;) is the leaking oil pressure
sender, but YMMV... as I said, there is a lot going on there.
