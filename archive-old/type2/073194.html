&gt;supposed to be positioned, and how to adjust the card?

The essential reference on adjusting the single Solex chokes is by Ron Van
Ness and it resides in the Library section of www.type2_dot_com:

Having understood how the thing works (it's really very simple) and having
adjusted it, if you still get the fuel smell then PLEASE do not drive the
bus anymore until you find the gas leak. I find it hard to believe that a
bus could have a choke so maladjusted that you could smell gas fumes in the
driver's seat, and still run. You may have a very dangerous fuel leak and
if you do you need to find it before you fry.
