Subject: Re: [T2] its different for dome lights

&gt; anyways... my front dome light on the 70 deluxe is shot - stays on alla 
&gt; time whether door is open or not. i guess it is so corroded internally 
&gt; that it no longer can tell the difference. all wiring TO the light seems 
&gt; in order.
&gt;
&gt; so i was looking for some online (bustedbus has them, but $35 is out of my 
&gt; league right now), and am talking with a vendor who INSISTS the front and 
&gt; rear dome lights are the same on an early bay. i say nertz; the front has 
&gt; connections for THREE wires, the rear only two. in addition, the front 
&gt; light has a 3-position switch, while the back has just 2 positions.  well, 
&gt; at least the ones on MY bus are like that!

Oh good, something that the less mechanically inclined ( like me ) MAY be 
able to help with.

Firstly, I'd suspect the door switch before the front light internals for 
that problem, door switches play up much of the time, they get knocked out 
of line and/or are more liable to be getting wet etc to form corrosion.

Seconly, Arnaud pointed out the dash switch which controls power to the rear 
light &quot;I have a doubt though because there is also this switch on the dash 
(on the right of the steering wheel. leftmost button) that I believe is 
supposed to turn on one of these domes. My switch is broken and I dunno if 
it was supposed to control dome front or dome back.&quot;, well, if he wasn't 
stuck with the a broken switch he would have, that's why the rear light in 
my '74 Campmobile only has an on/off, I can turn power on/off from the dash 
as well, and it's definitely a factory switch. ( In defense of the Vendor, 
this may only be a Camper thing, maybe the &quot;regular&quot; Kombis &amp; Microbusses 
didn't have the rear power switch? )

FWIW
