It means its time for an alignment!  Your toe and/or camber is off.  
Alignments really aren't that hard to do, and you can even get them 
pretty derned close with just using a tape measure and a string and a 
large open parking lot.  Or take it to a shop and have it lined up.  You 
live in WI, right?  Not sure where, but if you want to make a trip to 
Oshkosh and stop by Penske here in town, I'll cut you a deal on an 
alignment since I haven't touched a VW sine I started working there 
about 4 months ago!!
