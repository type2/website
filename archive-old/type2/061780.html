Subject: paint for 71 transporter

Hello,
Sorry to post this to the list, but I was unable to acess &quot;late model 
paint codes&quot; on the type 2 site. I have a 71 transporter that is in need 
of a new paint job. Currently the color is blue although I dont believe 
it to be the original, which is, what I am looking for. Any help on 
where I can locate the color is appreciated. 
Thanks,
Mari
