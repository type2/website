Subject: Re; No High Sign

John,

The basic reason for the no-return of the wave is elementary Watson-----

Your EV appears to be a some sort of  yuppie mini-van, with no distinct
individual characteristics, and by the time on coming vehicles of the
same marque notices it's a VW, it's too late, they are already gone.

I have also noticed that EV driver's most certainly don't give the
Type-2's or Vanagon's any recognition as a rule----

Their mostly all on Yuppie time, which translates to no time for anyone
but themselves.

I want to see what happens when the new Microbus arrives----- should be
interesting instant recognition phenomena, for the high sign----

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     &quot;In life, it is much better to want
something you cannot have---

Than to have something you can't get rid of&quot;
