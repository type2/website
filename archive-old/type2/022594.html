&lt;&lt;O.K., I've about 4 months before hot weather returns (maybe 5 - and we're

the '73 Westy. Even with a 1.8L (insted of the 1.7L that a '73 should have)
I'm leery of putting all that equipment on the engine. Has anyone installed
an A/C unit like you find in motorhomes (all electric - no engine mounted
compressor)? How much power does one of these puppies take to run?&gt;&gt;

Robin,

I think you're getting 2 different types of air condition mixed up here.
Motorhomes have those all electric top mounted units that work only when you
are parked and hooked up to shore power.  I guess you could install one of
these in a Bus, and then strap a big generator to the roof to run it.  Some
RV's have built in generators, but you don't have room for one of those.

It would be a lot of work to install the original type air conditioning in
your '73 Westy.  My '74 came with air originaly, but the PO removed it because
it hardly worked, robbed power, and he kept hitting his knees on the under
dash unit.

Possibly a newer after market more efficient system could be adapted, but
again, it might be just a lot easier to buy a newer Vanagon westy that already
has air.
