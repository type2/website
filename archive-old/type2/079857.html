Subject: Possum Name Sticks

     After putting Possum, my 78' westy, on the road this past weekend I
was dissappointed because I had no heat. I had wired the heater boxes open
and still nothing, not a bit of heat, even with everything else hooked up.
The bus used to have AC and had this big condenser w/dual fans under the
bus near the middle. I removed that and tried to see if the valve there for
the rear compartment vent was jammed or broken. It moved freely, so I
removed the hose clamp to look down the tube and guess what I found? A
critter nest running from the valve all the way back to the Y section at
the heater boxes. Removed nest and heat works great. My last bus was a 72'
and the heat sucked in that thing. I dont know if it is because my heater
boxes are in really good shape or what but this 78' has really good heat
bone stock. I never thought I would say that about a bus.
     Question though: I would like to hook up the auxillary battery and it
appears that most of the wiring is there. The terminals have been cut off
however the cut out relay is there.
     1. Does anyone have a legible copy of the factory wiring diagram for
the camping equip on a 78' westy?

     2. Is the stock auxillary battery setup acceptable or should I get one
of these aftermarket kits? I like stock myself, but am looking for
experiences here.

     3. Who sells GOOD QUALITY door seals?
