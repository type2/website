Subject: Funny clutch

You know, this has me a little confounded and a lot concerned...
The past few mornings (having been especially cold, FYI) I've driven the Bus
to work. There were three separate instances of when I'd push the clutch in,
and the engine would race, as if I'd hit the gas pedal. WTF is up with that?
