You don't need to do any oil plumbing or use the original sender! There
HAS to be an electrical way. Why not use a switching relay, and wire the
lamp through the contact which is closed when the relay switching side
is open?

RE:	Oil pressure sender - general question

[...]
Problem is, while the gauge works just fine, the dummy light works in
reverse.  It goes off when pressure drops below the threshold level of
the sendor, but stays on the rest of the time.  I re-installed the
original idiot light sender and it works right.

Any ideas (other than spring for the $30 to buy the correct sender)?
Maybe Audi used a relay between the sender and the dummy light instead
of direct-wired like the VWs?
