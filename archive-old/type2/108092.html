Subject: My Kid's New Bus part 2

Hi all,

Thanks for all the helpful suggestions re: my kid's new bus.  We took the bus to Bob's Beetle Shop and he looked it over as per the many safety matters you all brought up.  He felt the bus was in good shape, nothing major, gave me a wish list of things to improve.  He did a tune-up, new wires, distributer cap, plugs, etc.  Adjusted the carboraters, and the things was humming.

Next chapter . . . we were taking the bus out for a spin and we lost 2nd and 4th gears.  Drove home in third.  Spent some time trying to find the lost gears, and had not luck.

We tried to adjust the shifter . . . no luck.  The y shaped coupler in the rear seams to be OK.  Anyway, the situation as it stands is the bus is stuck in either first or third and it seems like something in the linkage is stopping it from finding the other gears.  I am afraid it might be beyond us, however, my kid just got Bentley in the mail and wants to give it a shot himself before another trip to  Bob's Beetle.

Any suggestions?
