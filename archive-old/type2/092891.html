Subject: Re: [T2] What n Where does this go?

Looks like the rpm test lead for the dealer to hook up his computer.

It doesn't hook to anything and was usually clipped out of the way. Many 
folks have cut them off. I left mine in tact but used a wire tire to get it 
out of the way.

Trying to put back together an 82 2.0 that the PO has carb'd
&gt;(many questions to come on this) and am trying to reconnect the electricals.
&gt;I have a round plug with three connectors that appears to be coming from the
&gt;tranny (but I know diddly about any VW engines). Here's a really poor
&gt;picture
&gt;here of the plug propped up on the intake runner:
