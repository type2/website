Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for windshield wiper part...

Can't believe I overlooked that detail. Been a long day... the bus is a '72, 
and the wiper arms on it are '78s. I don't think there's a difference in 
these years; they worked fine until I broke them.

&gt;WHAT YEAR IS YOUR BUS??????
&gt;
&gt; &gt; As I mentioned a while back, the passenger side wiper shaft broke while 
&gt;I
&gt; &gt; was (over-)tightening the bolt. Well, I'm set to replace the broken 
&gt;shaft
&gt; &gt; now. Does anybody know the part number/where I can get one?
