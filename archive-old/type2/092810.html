Spend $100 for an hour of chassis dyno time.  Make sure they have a 
wideband O2 sensor.  Adjust the mixture via whatever means you have 
available to you (fuel pressure, AFM adjustment?  I'm no bus FI expert) 
until you are seeing 12.x at WOT.  Go drive your bus to your heart's content.

&gt;Since that time I have made an effort to understand how FI works on my 
&gt;bus. I have collected literature and test equipment along with a extra 77 
&gt;bus FI system and am assembling a mock-up of the 77 FI system.

If your test equipment includes a gauge that reads your stock O2 sensor, 
don't put any faith in what it tells you.  All it can tell you is whether 
you are north or south of 14.6, nothing more.
