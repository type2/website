&gt;It is bus magic
&gt;
My 18 year old daughter, who drives my bus like a queen astride her horse,
was talking about how much she enjoys just going here and there in the bus,
and said &quot;It's just impossible to be angry while you're driving this thing.&quot;

There's some truth in that, at least for me.
