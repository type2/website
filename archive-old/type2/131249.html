Subject: Re: [T2] Guide to disposable gloves

That explains why the ACDelco branded ones I saw proudly displayed &quot;Nitrile
Gloves&quot;.

Latex works too, but the latex ones that are available cheap are for doing
dishes and have like zero sensitivity.

I have yet to try some of these, but will probably get some the next time
I'm at the FLAPS.

Thanks for the info!
Don

&gt; I came across this tag on a pair of gloves I bought and thought it was
worth
&gt; sharing. It tells how how latex, neoprene, nitrile and vinyl hold up to
&gt; various chemicals:

&gt; I wish I'd seen this before the automotive reducer ate though the gloves I
&gt; was using. Strong stuff.
