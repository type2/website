Subject: 79 Engine Vents and Rain Water

OK, am I missing something?

How is rain water supposed to drain after it enters the rear engine vents
(the ones right behind the back side windows)?  On my 79 bus, it appears to
me that it just drains down to the battery shelf.  Is this correct?  I mean,
rain water and battery acid... what a combination for making rust.  I had
planned to put acid reducing mats under my batteries (I have a camper with
dual batteries), but now I'm thinking this might be a bad idea if rain water
will collect down there... the mat will probably hold the water and make the
problem even worse.  So, am I correct in my observation that the water just
goes down to the battery shelf or am I missing something - or, for that
matter, is my bus missing something?

TIA
