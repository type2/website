Don and All;

Given the attributes of the water-cooled Vanagon, with the unfortunate 
exception of the leaky and expensive powerplant, a Subaru engine retrofit 
would seem to be an interesting option.

The cooling system/radiator/heating system is already integrated into the 
vehicle, so if an adapter were available to mate the Subaru engine to the 
Vanagon transaxle it ought to be a 'relatively' straightforward conversion.

A Sub. mill in a Type 2 with appropriately designed radiator 
installation/plumbing is a neat idea, but a Sub. into a water-cooled Vanagon 
seems like a more &quot;logical&quot; and simple approach.

&gt; I don't know where to get the info, but someone is making a conversion kit 
for Type II's to the Subaru 1800cc engine. &lt;
