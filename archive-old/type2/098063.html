Subject: engine is coming out, advise please

a few weeks ago i was driving my bus around, a 73 westy, 1700cc 1.7L, and it started knocking, to make a long story short, found out i have a stuck intake valve on my #1 cylinder, as well as very worn valve seats, so i got a set of heads off ebay (thanks billy for the lead on those) and am going to put them on this weekend, from the information i have gathered, it sounds like it would be easier to pull the motor to replace the heads, i have the how to keep your volkwagen alive book and a chiltons for reference, just a quick question for you guys, is there a head gasket i need to replace, i havent found any info. stating ther is a head gasket?????? also ANY advice on pulling the motor would be very appriciated.

thanks in advance
