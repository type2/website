I have a 2.0L Vanagon &quot;CV&quot; longblock.  On the front of the case, just under the hole for the oil level dipstick, the capitalized letter &quot;A&quot; is stamped into the case and  two (2) small dots to the right of the letter (looks like this.....   A : )
 
Does anyone know what this means?  Is it common or have any significance?  Haven't been able to find anything in a book or on the web so far.
 
Also the heads don't have any casting/part numbers that I can find.  The only markings on the heads is &quot;AMC&quot;.  Anybody able to enlighten me on this one?
 
BTW.... The case also has a REMANUFACTURED BY VOLKSWAGEN CANADA, INC yellow label on top of the oil separator casting.
 
TIA,
