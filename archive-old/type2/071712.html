Nevada's hot about any way you do it.  You could go up 395 but you 
would have to cut over 80 or 50 to get back to the Idaho side.  I'd 
recommend I15 to St. George (at night if possible) then over utah 9 
through Zion to US 89.  This will take you up cool valleys all the 
way to SLC (actually to SE Idaho).  On your way you could stop at 
Bryce Canyon and I'd recommend the side trip on Utah 12 up to 
Escalante National Monument, Calfs Creek falls, Boulder Hog Back, 
Boulder Mountain, and Capital Reef NP.  GOD'S Country!  A different 
view around every corner.

What Part of Idaho are you heading for?

What Part of Wyoming?  Check out Thermopolis if your close, 
especially if you have kids.

Have fun.  Stop by if you're in the area or need a drive way to camp in.

Subject: [T2] Any SoCal-Idaho trip experiences?

Hi All:

Anyone out there done a summer road trip from Southern California to the
Idaho and Wyoming areas? I'm thinking of a trip next month going up I-15 but
it sure looks hot, like over 100 degrees F., until well into the mountains
of Wyoming and Idaho. Is this as hot as it looks or are there some cooler
areas along the way that I'm not seeing? At those temps it doesn't look like
much fun for me or my poor engine.

Any feedback from someone who's done this is much appreciated.
