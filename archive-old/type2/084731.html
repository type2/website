&gt;Hello again.
&gt;
&gt;I have been considering replacing the air filter box on my fuel injected
&gt;type4 with a more modern &quot;performance&quot; air filter style. The kind you see
&gt;on those K&amp;N intake kits.
&gt;&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;Can anyone think of why this would be a bad idea. I know these L-Jetronic
&gt;systems can be fussy when you alter the way they work (even if very
&gt;slightly).

I can think of a couple of reasons why this would be a bad idea.  First and 
foremost, the airflow pattern going through the air meter is important.  If 
you remove the airbox and replace it with a K&amp;N or other conical filter, 
the airflow pattern will be quite different and may cause rough running 
because of turbulence in your air meter.  You would increase your chances 
of success by adding a length of pipe between the air meter and the filter, 
but you're really playing with a complicated process that you (probably) do 
not have the equipment to measure accurately.  Second reason is that the 
conical filters are more exposed and collect dirt much more quickly than 
the filter in the airbox would.

I think a better course of action would be to find a K&amp;N panel filter that 
fits in the stock airbox.  You get all of the benefits and none of the risk 
of going with the conical filter.  Been There, Done That.  Won't do it again.
