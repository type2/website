&gt; Hey all, I know its been covered before, but what tricks to you all use
&gt; to keep the halfmoon engine bolt from turning? Ever since I rebuilt the
&gt; starter and cleaned up the trans, the bolt wants to turn.
&gt; thanks

The PO of my Bug welded a bolt to the head of the right-hand engine bolt.
The welded-on bolt hits the side of the transmission when you screw a nut
onto it.
