Hello, Volks!

Just a short status report and a serious question.

First, I am in LA, at Nikki Elko's, and more than half way around, having
stopped and visited with Al Brase, Jim Arnott, Scott Solomon, Doktor Tim
and Karl von Salzen.  I will be hanging here thru next Sunday and *will*
be here for the barbeque next Saturday... y'all *are* invited!  Write
Nikki for details/directions (shrike3_at_earthlink_dot_net)

The one problem I am having is in the left rear corner.  When I got to
Tim's place, I had a whisk-whisk-whisk which is classic brake, but could
not tell from the driver's seat which wheel.  Tim identified the wheel and
a short exam turned up a loose 46mm axle nut as the problem.  I tightened
it and it was fine thru slightly before Fresno and Karl's.  I had an
on-and-off something starting up about then, but it would not occur for
Karl :-( I drove here to LA, by which time it was a fairly constant
&quot;ladder on the roof&quot; vibration.  This morning, I checked and sure enough,
the left rear big nut was loose again.  Again I have tightened it, but now
I am concerned.  Any idea WTF is going on?  permanent cure?

We will be junkyarding today and I will be shopping for a complete bearing
carrier/stub axle/hub, just in case, but would love to figure out what has
happened.

Other than that the v'gon is performing well, with only annoyances popping
up here and there.  Baling wire will get it back I am sure :-)
