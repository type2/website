Subject: best bus... and SAFETY POST...

Ok, forgetting that the best bus is the one with the nicest, cleanest
most mechanicly persnickity PO...

some one said:
 Also the small 5 lug 
&gt; wheels with the flatter hubcaps that don't use hubcap clips.

And, with the 5-lug wheels you get composite drums, so you can work on
the rear brakes without removing the &quot;big nut&quot;.

also remember: those &quot;attractive wide five lugs&quot; are hard to find people
who can balance them. he last time I dealt with this issue was in albany
NY and there was one place that could balance the tire and they charged
accordingly (15$/tire!!! just to balance.)

That and having stood on top of many a breaker bar to &quot;break the nut&quot;,
Im all for the later style hubs.

One other thing that a mechanic friend pointed out to me was that in 68
whhen they went to the loaf style, the breaks didnt chang until 71. So
right along with a bigger body you have the old style breaks. Driving
the 70 cross country, I kept that in mind downhill as much as I kept the
1600hp dualport in mind uphill. I had some minor break fade in MT, I
pulled over immeaddetyly to let them cool. (Had a nice conversation with
a MT SP guy, turned out he had a convertable gia as a summer cruiser). 

On an unrelated issue:
For all you in the Portland area, or anyone traveling to Oregon this
summer, be wary of our gas attendents in this no-self-service state. I
went o an ARCO (you portlanders: the one on 26 at the Cornelius OR
junction) and said my usual &quot;fill it it till it goes off once&quot; speech
and went to the bathroom. I almost always get my gas filled at a
different ARCO (the MGR owns a '58), so I somejow made the ernious
connection that these guys would do as I asked.

Came back from the bathroom, paid my 13.10 (hmm, Ida thought it would
anly take 12$, but gas prices have gone up lately....) get back to my
car to find gas POURING out from behind the drivers wheel!! Well, thats
the gas vent tube so I figure IM Ok, as soon as it stops coming out....
but just to make sure I open the engine compartment and low and behold,
gas sis leeking sown opposite the battery tray, out from behind the
firewall and is all over my motor!.... well I have the boys push the bus
over to the side, wait an hour for the gas to quit leaking out (I
removed one of the gas tank cover screws to let the gas get out)
replaced the screws, thouroughly rinsed the inside antside of the back
of my bus off, and left.

moral: watch people fill your tank!!!!!
