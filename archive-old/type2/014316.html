Subject: Re: [T2] Oil cooler lines

I'm dealing with some options here.
First I have an additional oil cooler that is a four pass tube design
with 1/2&quot; tubes, approximately 14 Inches in length, I can get this cooler
mounted within about 18 inches of the sandwich type adapter. I'm leaning
towards trying this cooler before trying the stock type unit.
Originally I was planning on installing a standard type 4 cooler with the
plate design, that I can also mount within 18 inches of the sandwich
adapter.
Both coolers / adapters have threaded inlet  outlet ports so I can test
them both.
I was never trying to get more than about 20 degrees of additional
cooling at 3300 RPM.
I'm currently getting about 266 Degrees oil temp at 70 MPH and 3100 RPM,
outside temp 90 Degrees. Full load in high gear at highway speeds. Local
town driving I'm running about 210 / 220 degrees.
I've tried both the sump plate location and the oil bypass port location
for the oil temp sender and I'm getting the same oil temps at both
locations.
I've currently got about 60 PSI oil at 3000 RPM and 40 PSI at 2200 RPM
with an idle pressure of 20-22 PSI at 800-900 RPMs. I've got an 80 PSI
electronic gauge and it is pegged out upon starting the cold engine.
Cylinder head temp is about 350-360 at 70 MPH and outside temp of 90
Degrees. It just settles in at 330/350 in local town driving.
The engine has less than 2000 miles on it.
The engine has single .030 shims at the cylinder base and AMC heads (no
head gaskets), I'm assuming that I'm running about 7.4 compression ratio
if I've read the tech notes right.
Could a clogged catalytic converter raise engine temperatures?
My converter is seven years old but I've never had it off to see if the
engine runs cooler without it.
I got 110K out of my last engine and replaced it with this newly rebuilt
engine when the old engine got down to 90 PSI Cylinder pressure. 
I have never had any gauges or engine monitoring other than the idiot
light before I installed this new engine.(always had a tach).
I don't want to take this oil cooler thing on as a scientific experiment,
and I'm not trying to prove anything. I'm just looking for reasonable
temperatures on the occasions I get into situations where I want to
maintain 70 MPH going up hills keeping with the traffic flow.
I can't remember any time in the last seven years when I had my engine
RPM over 4000.

&gt; TOTAL  than this oil cooler setup. I really have to question (along 
&gt; with Dr.
&gt; Tim) whether any of this is even necessary unless you are running 
&gt; 103mm big
&gt; bores!
