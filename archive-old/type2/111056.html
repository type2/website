&gt;&gt; for your efforts. I can't afford much because I'm a very broke college 
&gt;&gt; student 
&gt;&gt;  but i can probably afford between $300-$400. Thank you very much for any 
&gt;&gt;  help! Fare thee well-Evan
&gt;&gt;  
&gt;How much would a U-Haul (or Ryder, etc) and a trailer or dolly cost?  That 
&gt;was how I got my '72 Westy from Zanesville, Ohio to here, Burnsville, 
&gt;Minnesota 
&gt;in October 1994 so I know it's gone up quite a bit since then.
