Subject: Loose shifter

More info on my sloppy shifter repairs

I pulled the transmission this AM to pull the shift rod out (motor is
already out for rebuilding) and found a cracked brass bushing on the end of
the nose cone of the tranny, where the shift coupler attaches to.  Grasped
the shaft where broken bushing was, and determined (obviously) that this
bushing being damaged was causing 95% of my slop.  Looked up the part
numbers in ETKA, called my vw dealer, and the part was still available, and
$2 something.

Satisfaction!!!
