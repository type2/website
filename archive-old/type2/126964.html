Subject: re: turn signal problems

Clarification:
 
Turn signals have worked worked fine for 8 years.  This came up out of the blue!  I'm the guy that assembled the electricals (long story).  Thanks for all the help so far - any other ideas?

&gt;
&gt; Fellow listmates and esteemed bus pilots,
&gt; A few days ago someone wrote in about turn signals not working when 
they applied the brakes.  I had a similar problem on my 69 and thought 
that I might find some answers.  My right turn signal would not work 
when my parking lights were on. The left worked just fine.  With the 
lights off the right would blink correctly but the left would blink 
simultaneously,  only faintly.  That was two days ago. I checked grounds, 
cleaned contacts checked bulbs, everything I could think of.  Now  I have NO 
turn signals - with parking lights on or off.  My hazards still 
operate.  If I engage my turn signals, my radio quits working. Turn the switch 
off and the radio comes back on. I pulled the signal switch out to 
check for foreign matter and found a loose wire (white with brown stripe) 
traced it to the headlight relay.  My frustration runs pretty high right 
now.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
