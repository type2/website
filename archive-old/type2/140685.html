Is this 45 min on the hwy,, or around town stop and go.. ?
You didn't mention if this is a 2 liter EFi engine in your 72,, or a stock dual
carb 1.7 liter

assuming it may be a stock dual carb engine... in my case #1....I found the fuel
pressure would drop off ... it seemed to run fine on the top half of the tank...
but didn't run as soon as the tank level was below the top of the carbs... an
hour after gassing up.
Using a fuel pressure gauge... I found there was some wear in the pump drive,
and I was able to compensate by pulling the 2 gaskets out from between the
intermediate mounting block under the fuel pump..... in the end, I sanded a few
thousands off the phenolic block so I could put the gaskets back in.

I would install a fuel pressure gauge and keep an eye on it.. if the pressure
drops off there are a few simple problems which are easy to find once you have
an idea where the problems is.

worn fuel pump drive arm
worm pump drive rod
worn cam shaft
worn pump internals
needle and seat troubles
plugged tank
plugged filter

In my Case #2  ,, I found a hose that was collapsing flat after time on the
highway... the pressure gauge indicated no pressure,, but every time I opened
the fuel system , that hose would return to normal..... it took some real
detective work to understand what the problems was NOT.. and come to the
conclusion it had to be that hose !
