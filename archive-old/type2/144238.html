&gt; &gt;I put a _very_ light smear of hylomar
&gt;
&gt; Hmmmm...Hy-lo-mar. Is there anything it can't do? :)

Darned little!  Sealant, dessert topping, makeup remover...

Actually, it is a dandy sealant for machined surfaces or gaskets.  I
noticed that VW de Mexico uses it on their new engines.  Hylomar
resists oil, is sticky enough to keep gaskets in place, but doesn't
harden.  The trick is to use it very sparingly.  If a bunch is squeezing
out of the joint, you're using too much.

I found out about it years ago from a BMW motorcycle mechanic.  At the
time, the stuff was hard to find (I think it came from Rolls Royce) and
cost $12 per tube!  Now it is on the regular Permatex rack at most FLAPS.
