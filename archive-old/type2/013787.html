i really dont think that this crap has anything to do with buses, it
shouldnot be included, im sorry but if your gonna call someone a
crotchety old mechanic then i think there is no room for someone like
you, this service is free to all who apply and this person was trying to
help you out, i dont care what you think. and if it wernt for the type 2
list where would alot of folks be who dont have anyone to learn
volkswagonese from? think about that. and next no one else wants to see
jibber jabber name calling on this- this is here for you and im not
trying to be an advocate of censorship but somethings need to be kept
private, this was one of those matters, so please in the future dont
write this crap on here, it means that someone else is going to have to
write this crap on here.
Peace 
Screwloose
