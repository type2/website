Subject:  Water based heater in an aircooled

I am the owner of an aircooled 2.0L VW Transporter and all this talk about
heaters as has prompted me to tell the Type2 list about my home made
heater. It uses water to transfere the heat from the engine to the insideof
the van. There was some disscusion about it on the Vanagon list earlier
this year. I have made some improvements since then and I am still very
happy with it. I'll go into more detail about how it works if anyone is
interested.
