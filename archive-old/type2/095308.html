Subject: What to do?



I have a stock 72 westy and planning to do an engine and carb rebuilt in the 
winter to keep me busy. I bought it in cali and the body is solid no rust 
original paint (a little faded with a few dings here and there).

Anyway I have a chance to pick up a 78 westy for pratically nothing (if not 
the owner will send her to the yard). It has been sitting forever. Rusted. 
Not running currently but the engine (2.0 FI) is good. The interior is mint. 
I was thinking of taking the interior (cabinets, sink, etc) and engine out 
of the 78 and putting it into my 72. I know the popups are different. As I 
understand it, the bodys for 72-79 was same. If so, will the interiors swap 
easily? How about an engine swap? More power would be nice but I've heard 
stay away from FI. If I were to swap engines, do I just have to change the 
flywheel and clutch or do I have to change the bell housing as well? How 
hard would an engine swap be?


Sorry to be so longwinded, but the owner is going to junk the 78 here in the 
next week. So any or all input would be grately appreciated.


Thanks,
Mike
