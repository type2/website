&gt; &lt;&lt; In either case, telling someone who wants to help a fellow bus owner out

&gt; finds out from one of her higher ups.

&gt; As reported in this month's R&amp;T...A British survey of both male and
&gt; female drivers had the majority prefer to be left alone - even all
&gt; night if necessary - rather than respond to an offer of help from
&gt; a stranger...;-(

Note that it wasn't the driver telling the good samaritan to get lost, it
was the cop who undoubtedly felt that her turf was being trod upon by an
unwelcome &quot;civilian.&quot;

Also, I think that a survey of british drivers has little applicability to
Americans, particularly VW folks.  I've never had a VW person be less than
delighted when I've stopped to assist them, and I would be delighted to
receive help in my hour of need.
