&gt;Not a pretty sight!

I imagine it hasn't had good compression in quite a while.  Compression 
checks are good.

&gt;Questions are:
&gt;Oil cooler, should I clean and re-use or replace?

I pondered this question also after my first bus engine grenaded many years 
ago.  After asking around I decided to spring for a new cooler.  If there 
has been shredded metal circulating in your engine, it is highly likely 
that some of it is stuck in the cooler.  There is also a good chance that a 
thorough cleaning would not remove all of this metal.  There is a smaller 
(though still significant) chance that this residual metal would come loose 
at some point during the lifespan of your new engine and make it's way to 
the crank journals where it could cause yet another catastrophic engine 
failure.

This is an example of one of those times where rebuilding your engine 
*before* a catastrophic failure saves you some money.  If you're on a 
serious shoestring budget, at least find a used cooler from an engine with 
a known history (i.e. one that did not grenade) for a better chance of success.

&gt;Push-rods and tubes, re-use or replace?

Re-use, with new viton seals ($15 at Bus Depot but they are a week behind 
on filling orders so you'd better not be in a hurry) unless they are deformed.

&gt;please pass along the things that you think everyone should already know.

Please what?  Please read the archives!  It's all in there and I don't have 
time to type it all out again, dig?
