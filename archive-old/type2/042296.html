Subject: Re: Tool question

&gt;  I can't see what 3 of these tools would be used for -
&gt; an 8mm and 10mm allen wrench, and a 27mm combo wrench. Where are these
used on a
&gt; VW?? I have a '71 --

The 27 fits the 2 big bolts holding on the rear trans mount saddle. The one
under the bellhousing.
