I payed an idiot $2500 for bodywork and gave him $800 worth of das bulli sheet
metal and got shoddy work with good parts, and wondered why in the hell didnt
i just do it myself?  if i go and buy a mig welder what am i getting myself
into?  i need to start on my lil bro's 66 westy soon, and have an artistic
hand, can i do it?  how much do they run for?  what are the brands of
preference, etc?  any advice would be appreciated.   ...dan morris...
