Subject: Seat Stand/Pedestal  Mats

Tried to post earier but no luck try again.

Greetings fellow bussers,

I have new replacement seat stand mats made by WCM I think. Problem is that 
they don't fit.  They are not the right shape. They are cut too low in the 
back (vertical surface) behind the seat stand above the large oval 
indentation. Furthermore, the overall design is different than original. The 
repo set is two peices of rubber whereas the original had three I think. 
Missing and somewhat combined in the two peices is the skinny peice that 
totally covers the rear of the top behind the seat (horizontal surface).

They will work for the drivers side, but only because the cabinet and spare 
tire compartment will hide the missing rubber. But what to do about the 
passenger side? At first I thought it was just the Westy seat swivel base 
that had things being different but yesterday in my local junkyard I noticed 
that all the passenger busses had the exact same shape seat stand/pedestal 
as the westy. At least close enough that a set of rubber made for a pass. 
but would work in a Westy.

Are the mats I have for an earier bus that take a dip in the back?I looked 
in WCM online and didn't see any other sets.  Anyone make mats that fit and 
don't leave you 3&quot; short in the back?  Any ideas other than searching for 
the rest of my life in junkyards accross the nation in hopes of finding 
decent non-torn originals?

Thanks,
Brandt
