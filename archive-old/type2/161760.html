Subject: Gas tank cleaning

I found it in the archives somewhere, but a cheap cement mixer with the gas 
tank strapped across the opening of the barrel, spun on a 45 degree plane, 
two gallons of water, 1 pint of muratic acid, and a double fistful of nuts 
and bolts that you want to recycle.  Takes a little trial and error and 
slight modification of the mixer (I think I had to take the handle off the 
pivot and put it on upside down) but you end up with a 'like new' interior 
of the tank and new nuts and bolts to boot.
Next time after I've rinsed the tank and it's dry, I'll put it back on the 
mixer with the POR 15 to make sure it's spread evenly.  Great stuff.
