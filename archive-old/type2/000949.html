&gt;I think you forgot where you are. This is the type 2 list. We must not fail to
&gt;mention
&gt;GD = 76-77 2 liter bus, solid lifters, FI
&gt;GE = 78-79 2 liter bus, hydraulics, FI
&gt;(I know you're a 914 guy!)

The original post was a request to identify a 914 engine
of unknown origin in a vw bus. My post stands.

The other obvious differences would be the dipstick location
and the oil filler. As regards engine codes, please note that
an engine can be rebuilt in a variety of ways. 1.7, 1.8 and 2.0
engine internals will fit in these cases, and big bore kits and
cams, stroker cranks, etc. will make a significant change.
Three bolt intake manifold mounting bolts on the 914 2.0 will not
be a definitive answer there, if the valve specs have been modified.
Vanagon engine swaps are also risky to I.D. It all goes to show
you don't know what you have unless you take it apart and look.
( And , besides, the &quot;porsche&quot; guys call it a volkswagen engine ).
