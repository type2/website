Subject: Re: Bus Depot

Perhaps this is not the forum to be taking this up on but the post and the
follow up really burned me as I have about a month ago, ordered a front
baywindow rubber seal from Bus Depot.
IT NEVER CAME.
A while ago I ordered the MIDDLE window of a transporter bus, which some of
us know it has a slit for the vent wing, which has it's own seal, anyhow, I
got back a very BACK window seal, they sent me two of them.  When I sent
back the first one I also circled ON A PICTURE of my bus WHICH seal I
needed, low and behold, the WRONG seal comes again.
Then I get a call from a woman at Bus Depot telling me how much I owe
them??? WHAT?
I just sent back a rear side marker lens (they sent me the wrong color) and
two seals and she says that there is a &quot;discount&quot; on one seal and how much
it is, I tell her I paid already and she says I have to talk to another
person about that and they would call me back, NOT.

So, to this day, I am still waiting for the '76 bay front windshield seal
for one of my buses.  I need it to continue body work.

So RON, can you look up my name and see why everyone likes to blow me off at
your company?

Peace,
Sunshine

&gt; So, my '72 is waiting on windshield rubber.
&gt; Listees - which mfg is the best?
&gt; Vendors - who's got it in stock?

Mine is both the best, and in stock.  $19.95 gets you a genuine Volkswagen
seal. Everyone else has repro's, and for more money.  Part # 211 845 121D.
