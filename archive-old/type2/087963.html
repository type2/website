Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel warning

&gt; alcohol would not settle out of gasoline.  

Then, what IS this stuff? Do you have any guesses?

to test this yourself get a 
&gt; bottle of everclear from you local medicinal purposes shop and pull a 
&gt; shot of gas from your tank.

We don't have Everclear in California. Have to go out of state to buy it.
