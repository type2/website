Subject: Spark Plugs

Several times when I've purchased spark plugs for my 83 Air Cooled Type
IV engine I've had counter personnel suggest that I run a hotter plug.
I guess I was rude when I never queried *Why should I do that?.
I've been running the specified Bosch Copper plugs and I'm content with
them but it has been suggested that a range or two up on the hot scale
will give me better fuel economy by improving combustion burn.
Any body try a few bumps up on hotter plugs and get better mileage,
performance etc.?

Bill M.
