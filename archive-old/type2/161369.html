Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for an engine- AVP?

You know I was one of the first to warn about slipping quality from Mark Stevens (gone about 2 years after I did so warn) and from AVP in the day (pushing 8-10 years ago now.)  Both were nice folks, the people at AVP are particularly nice, but perhaps as things took off (from our internet business among other things) stuff did become hit and miss.  In retrospect though another thing to consider is that all along, time creeps on and the available core materials become older, more used, the good stuff dissapears, you are rebuilding T4 core heads that have already been once, twice, ???? many times rebuilt, German P&amp;C's become Brazilian, that now become far eastern junk.  German bearing sets dissapear, lifters start being made in who knows where, etc, etc.  I think Bob Donald's said he isn't even rebuilding a lot of heads anymore, there is a reason.  It's hard to make a buck on a well built product and keep your good rep when things coming in become worse and worse.  Anyway
 like I said, I was the first to pan some of these people when their stuff bit me in the day, but you do have to understand the factors at play.  And I agree with Jim, GEX actually had a top notch rep in the early 80's, I had a GEX 2.0 I bought in high school before I started doing my own stuff, that is still running strong for the lady I sold the bus to about 21 years and coming on 120k miles later. YMMV.

  GEX at one time WAS an excellent engine builder. I know, because I use to
hang around their shop as a when I first into VWs professionally (a long
time ago in a galaxy far, far away.....if you can call Baldwin Park, CA that
;-)...). I grew up just a mile or so from their facility and used several
of their engines from the 70s thru early 80s. It was in the mid 80s after
