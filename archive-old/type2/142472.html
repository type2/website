Subject: Re: [T2] wanted: watercooled replacement engine for 1973 bus

If you want to keep it VW go with a 1.8 gas engine or a 1.6 Diesel engine.  I 
have a friend who did the same on a 69 Bus. I'll send his email to you so you 
 can swap notes. I agree with Greg you are better off sticking with the 
original  motor. Do what makes you happy. When you modify you hassle. In my opinion 
it's  more of a hassle to covert that it is to hassle the original aircooled 
motors.
