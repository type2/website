Subject: Re: [VB] visiting Colorado Springs

I would go to OE Vee Dub (ex RMMW buyer/supplier?)above Woodland Park and
there is a couple of Vw shops there in Co Springs but I am unsure of where
or their name!  They used to be associated the RMMW used parts business!
And make sure you drive up Pikes Peak!  No just get in the mountains there!
Check out 11 mile park and the surrounding area!
70 miles to Denver and Painters Grinders and Randy's Stuff ( or whatever it
is called now).  Boulder has tons of busses so there has to some where they
work on them too!

Oh and Coors is close too and they give tours or used too!  But I pissed
upstream so watch out if its yellow!
There are a number of Micro brews in Co so have fun!  I am sure some Co
listies will hook you up.  Call next time in Omaha
Rob
None of that in Omaha though!
