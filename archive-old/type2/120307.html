Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Propane Conversion (More!)

Hmmmm.....

I noticed in reading my previous post that I picked up one apples/oranges
typo.  I entered the btus for gasoline and propane in btu/gal and the btus
for methanol in btu/lb.  methanol should be in btu/gal!  my typo!

I also did a bit more research. As I knew from previous go-rounds on this
subject it is rife with opinions of near-religious fervor.  As with
LINUX/Mac/Windows it is possible to find a congenial web page for every
point of view and getting a coherent set of stats is nigh on to
impossible.  Below are a set of data collected from the web sites listed
in sources.  Make of them what you will.  As I look at it what I see is
that you will get slightly better milage and slightly worse power with
propane and the same power but much worse gas mileage with methanol.

                 Gasoline          Propane          Methanol
BTU/lb
high             20,250            21,000           9,730
low              19,000                             8,640

BTU/gal          124,000           92,000           64,700

stoichiometric
ratio            14.7:1            15.6:1           6.5:1
