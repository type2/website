Subject: Re: Distributor Drive Shaft Position

&gt;&gt;Usually, but it depends.  My engine needed two to bring the drive shaft
height into spec.  You can run any number of washers on a type IV&lt;&lt;

I've got a couple of different opinions on this.  Leonard at AVP says there
is only one size of spacer for distributor drive shaft height on the type
IV.  He also said that they never cut the 'shoulder' on the case where the
spacer rides so it should be no different than when I sent it in.  The Tom
Wilson book infers that there are different sizes available from VW, but it
(Wilson) is talking generically about type I and type IV engines.  BTW, can
distributor drive shaft height be measured without dismantling the engine?
I feel pretty sure I could get enough advance (I need about 4-5 degrees to
get to spec at 5 degrees ATDC) if I could get a thicker spacer, but I don't
know how good that would be for the two gears involved.  The more I think
about this, the more I think the spacer might be the problem here.

&gt;&gt;I'm glad it worked out for you, but I still think it was risky.&lt;&lt;

You're scarin me here!!!

&gt;&gt;I don't see how this could be necessary.  Your distributor must have an
extremely limited range of adjustment.  Are they all that way or is
something preventing yours from turning farther?  I can't believe that a 1
tooth change is too coarse.  Any chance you really moved it more than one
tooth?&lt;&lt;

I do have a very limited range of movement.  The cold start valve (FI
remember) obstructs the vacuum advance preventing any further rotation of
the distributor in the advance direction.  Yes I am sure that I only moved
it one tooth!  I had that shaft in and out on Saturday at least 3 times to
verify this.  When I advance the shaft one tooth, rotation of the
distributor (in the retard direction) results in the vacuum advance hitting
against the fan housing, and the best I can get is around 12 degrees BTDC.
I get a hell of a lot more power that way, but I don't want to run that
way.
