Subject: Re: [T2] Compression check &amp; Valve adjustment

Hi Barry,

Have  you installed new rings? Is there any evidence of blow-by? Those 
low compression numbers might be from bad rings as opposed to leaky 
valves. It might also be a good idea to retorque the heads, just in 
case...

A leak-down test would provide more useful data at this point than a 
retest of compression using a different gauge.

Happy trails,

&gt; OK, I took the  heads off my '72 1.7 liter engine.
&gt;
&gt; After a bit of head work, I buttoned it all back up and just did a 
&gt; compression check.  I  got 1 - 110; 2 - 105; 3 - 90; 4 - 110.  [I am 
&gt; going to buy a better compression checker, so I can get a better 
&gt; reading.]
&gt;
&gt; If I now re-adjust the valves and do another compression check, should 
&gt; I expect to see different  [better] values??
&gt;
&gt; After all, the valves WERE adjusted before I took the heads off and 
&gt; pulled the valves and bead blasted the heads and lapped the valves and 
&gt; swapped out a pair of exhaust valves and put on new head gaskets....  
&gt; But that shouldn't matter, right?!?!?!
