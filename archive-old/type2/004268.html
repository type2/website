    Well time is running out, you west coast guys better leave today if you
want to get here in time for the show! The show is the Buckeye German
Jubilee and its going to be held this weekend July 7&amp;8 in the same spot it
has been held for at least 7 years. Where is that, you ask? About 20 miles
South of Youngstown Ohio in beautiful Columbiana Oh. It is 5 miles South of
Ohio Turnpike exit # 16 on State route 7 or 1 mile North of State Route 14
on State route 7. The address is:
Jim's Custom VW's
219 State Route 7
Columbiana, Ohio 44408
    Admission is only $1 and used part swap spaces are only $25 for both
days ($15 for 1 day). We have a free trophy car show, 50/50 raffles both
days, Games for the kids, a big door prize raffle, a burnout contest, a bug
push, food available from breakfast to dinner, and a charity auction. Last
year we had 175 cars over the weekend and we didn't even advertise the show.
This year we are expecting even more.  If you have a 100 point show car that
you roll out of a trailer, or a candidate for the coveted best use of Duct
tape award you will probably enjoy this show. If you like Judges crawling
under you car and deducting points for not having the proper semi-gloss
black floor pan this show is probably not for you. If you want a laid back
VW fellowship weekend than you need to be here! See you this weekend! If you
need more info E-mail me at volksnut_at_1st_dot_net or call me at (740)765-5580
after 3:00pm please or call Jim's Custom VW's at (330)482-0018

                                                   John W. Morris
                                              President, Tri-State VW Club
