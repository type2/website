Subject: [T2] front brake pads sticking

the old squeak i had brought up a while back was found to be a stuck
pad, so i
replaced the front hoses which were collapsed, and it stopped it for a
while. But now the squeak is back, should i replace the pads? they do
have a lot of wear on them. i'm wondering if this will stop them from
sticking.
thanx
