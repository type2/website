I believe they are Cheng Shin pistons from China. When the topic  
comes up on Samba/STF it's often reported that the piston rings are  
low quality and you would benefit from replacing them before  
installation.

As far as deals go, Steve Houston sells Mahle Brazil 94mm 2L P&amp;C for  
$195 + ship.

I wonder why the prices differ so much from their other website:
