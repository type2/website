Subject: Re: Busses as off-road vehicles

Someone asked:

&gt;How are busses as off road vehicles?

Well, IMHO, buses are pretty awful off-road vehicles (they are NOT off-road
vehicles.

However, having said that, they do have certain features which make them
very good at dealing with poor roads: High ground clearance; rear engine
improves traction of driven wheels; independent suspension (which makes for
low unsprung mass).

The VW bus's biggest failing for off-road (as opposed to poor road) use is
the front overhang -- it simply does not allow the approach angles
necessary for off-road use.

I have taken several of my buses on roads which barely warrant the title
(including some marked &quot;4WD only&quot;) and they did very well, tho a limited
slip diff would have come in handy.

VW buses do need some kind of &quot;road&quot; to drive on. However, they are good on
very uneven surfaces and in deep sand, but without a limited slip diff and
aggressive off-road-type tyres, keep well away from deep mud.
