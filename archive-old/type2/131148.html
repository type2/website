Subject: Frequent Frustration with a Reluctant Relay

On my '69 bus, there is a constant problem making the dash turn signal
indicators flash.  About five years ago, I replaced the original relay (it
caught fire) with a replacement.  That one flashed the interior lights for a
few months, then quit mysteriously.  Ever since, it's gotten stuck on
occasion, will not flash the outside(actual) turn signals, and you have to
thump it to get it to continue relaying.  So I bought a new relay, hoping
that the stickiness and the lack of interior indicators were somehow
related.

This has continued even after installing a new relay.  Argh.

Now before you ask, the dash indicator bulbs do work, they light up their
best when you pull the switch for the hazard lights.  That's what I don't
understand.

I looked at the schematic in Bentley, and my system closely resembles the
one shown as 1970, having a 4-pole relay and the same terminal descriptions
shown there.  What mine does have that is not shown on Bentley is an extra
brown wire lead coming off 31, about 6 inches long, that I have no idea
where it goes... no help given on that.  I tried grounding it out, but this
does not change anything.  Should this be going to a fusebox or something?

If anyone has one of these busses, and wouldn't mind taking a peek under
their dash, I would be very grateful.

Thanks a ton,
