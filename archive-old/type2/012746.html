I'm guilty of attempting all of the stand up testing first.

I did a compression check and had lower than normal compression on
cylinder #3 but the engine was cold so I can't speak for the accuracy. I
just have a pump up type compression tester that holds the highest
reading and not a bleed down type which would probably be more accurate.

But  I've seen decent compression when the seat just happens to be in the
right position when the engine stops.

Both cyliner heads are new at 35,000 miles ago with the complete rebuild
and just long enough to be out of warranty.

I'm going to lay under the engin tomorrow and turn the engine to see if
I've dropped a valve seat.

I've had several different new spark-plugs in it and tried about four ???
good used wires on it.

I'm just having a real hard time believing a valve seat or lifter
problem, I guess it's just too scary!

Do you want to hear the final resolution If I get the problem isolated ?

Thanks
Stan

&gt; &gt; know where to start.
&gt; &gt; In short, I'm having a backfire through number 3 cylinder and the 
&gt; engine
&gt; &gt; just really runs funky.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Any assistance from any source would be appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; check your valves, hyd lifters can get out of adjustment too.  had 
&gt; this
&gt; problem when a valve seat pulled through...somehow me rebuilder got 
&gt; a set
&gt; of valve seats that hadn't been tempered.  he rebuilt em for me 
&gt; without
&gt; any problem. but it was a pain swapping heads again (now gotta take 
&gt; my
&gt; spare set out and put the rebuilt ones back on)
