Subject: injector timing query

To Sean Bartnik &amp; list

Quoting Sean:
&gt;They are supposed to receive 12v constantly all the time the ignition is
on.  When they are to be fired, the ECU grounds them.
&gt;Since all the injectors are grounded (fired) at the same time, it is
perfectly OK to swap the plugs.

?? Hmmm...yues I've read that somewhere...BUT  the distributor points make
contact at the right time, sending the primary voltage to the coil (and to
the ECU input.)   The rotor determines which spark plug gets the secondary
current.  I'd think the injector has to fire it's gas into the incoming air
timed  to compression in its cylinder.   But since the brain only gets a
signal when the points close due to distrib. cam action, how does the ECU
know which cylinder injector to ground?    Since the fuel ring is under
pressure and the injectors fire gas at each grounding, wouldn't
simultaneous injection waste gas???
