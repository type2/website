Subject: Re: [T2] Spokane, Ground Zero Gathering?

Sleep...at the gorge?  no, not gonna happen.  the &quot;camp ground&quot; if that is
what you want to call it, should be re-named to  &quot;party ground&quot;  I am not
sure with a show like the who, but I could only imagine.  You might try
making a reservation at the vantage camp ground.  I think it is about an
hour east of the gorge.  If you have no t been to the gorge before, you are
in for a real treat.  I saw Roger Waters there 2 years ago and man was it a
bitchin show!

&gt; I love good coffee.  Will probably try and stop for taste.  Are you
telling me
&gt; that I won't get much sleep at the gorge

&gt; &gt; Steve,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If you like good coffee, this is the place for you.  It's not a huge
place,
&gt; &gt; but I like to call it home.  We roast our own and it's always fresh!
You
&gt; &gt; could try riverside state park for camping in this area, and there is
&gt; &gt; always
&gt; &gt; the gorge campground.  However, nobody ever really sleeps in that
&gt; &gt; campground.  If you want to stop by the shop on your way through town,
I
&gt; &gt; would be happy to give you directions.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So my son and I will probably in the Spokane area on the 5th of July on
our
&gt; &gt; way to see the Who and Counting Crows at the Gorge at George on the 6th.
&gt; &gt; Think a stop at Ground Zero would be in order.  Any places to camp in
the
&gt; &gt; area?  Maybe this is how other gatherings began?
