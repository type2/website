Folks,

There's a wealth of auxiliary heater info only a couple clicks from the 
Type2_dot_com main page  (click on the Library button and then on Heating).  I 
dare say it's the best single resource for heating an aircooled VW anywhere.

This morning I added to the Library's heater page Caspar de Lint's article 
covering the installation of a BN4 in his '76 Westfalia.   Caspar includes 
some great shots of cutting for ductwork which aren't included in my heater 
articles.  BTW, if anyone out there has a perfect, uncracked padded dash 
for his '76 Westfalia, you can contact him at: casba_at_tip.nl

There's gobs of useful info in Library, but the Heating section is one of 
my pet projects (and tends to generate the most pmail) so I augment that a 
bit more than the other sections.

Coming soon to the Library will be another photo article from Caspar 
covering his front seat re-upholstering project.  I've been meaning to 
re-upholster my seats for the past few years but I've been employing the 
Procrastination Methode (PM) and, for some reason, I just don't seem to be 
making much progress...

While you folks are perusing the Library, if you see a need for a 
technical/photo how to article on a given subject, drop me a line and I'll 
put it on the Library's agenda.  Contributions of detailed repair articles 
(with photos if possible) are also welcome and appreciated.

One Library page I'd like to see built up some more is the Westfalia 
interiors page (http://type2_dot_com/library/camper/westpics.htm).  If you see 
an interior variation missing and you'd like to contribute photos, drop me 
an email. I have yet to include a plain Jane '68-'72 westy interior--and I 
own one!!! (PM)

Stay tuned...

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;In your note below, you mention something about the original Auxillary
&gt;heaters that were available for buses, and I'd like to hear more about
&gt;this......

&gt;Chris...I found this site the other day
&gt;http://www.type2_dot_com/rvanness/accessor.htm Look down towards the bottom of
&gt;the page.
&gt;
&gt;I recently sent for some info on modern versions of these ebersbacher
&gt;heaters. They look great, some can heat water too! VERY expensive though.
&gt;For my VW is was running to around 700 UK quid adout $1000? ish.!!
