Thanks to everybody that responded to my question!  Unfortunately it never
occurred to me to replace these hoses when I went through the fuel and vacuum
lines which were all pretty leaky when I bought the bus (I also had a fast
idle problem which I &quot;solved&quot; by plugging the line to the decell
valve...maybe I can unplug it after this job?) .  I guess I'll try cutting
them off and if I can't replace them that way then I'll take off the manifold
tubes.

Again, thanks
