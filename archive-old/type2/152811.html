Subject: Re: [T2] FI or carb

Not only is the FI superior, especially with the 2.0 T4, a single carb or
even dual carbs wont give you the power and reliability that FI does, it
will give you many more headaches than the FI. The L-jet does have some
common issues, sometimes even expensive, but overall, if you only have a
small issue with it, fix it!

also, just in case you don't have it, this troubleshooting guide is the best
for working with the l-jet systems. I suggest printing it out and putting it
in a 3-ring binder and keeping it in the bus at all times :) I also used
this guide to help me convert my '73 westy (installed a '81 2.0 with the
l-jet) and after i installed it I didn't even touch it until 10k miles later
when i rolled the bus on the drivers side, something went wrong after that,
and never figured it out before i sold it :(

&gt; Hi Shaggy,
&gt;
&gt; Learn to maintain the FI. It's no more prone to leak than carbs. I
&gt; converted my dual-carbed bus over to FI in the spring of 2004 and
&gt; have been quite happy with it since. I drove the same bus with carbs
&gt; for 5 years before that and the FI is definitely superior.
&gt;
&gt; Happy trails,

&gt; &gt; my FI leaks a litle, which I am going to fix, dont
&gt; &gt; want a fire, but thinking of putting a carb on instead
&gt; &gt; of the FI, maybe a single, or a friend of mine has a
&gt; &gt; dual carb laying around that he is not using. this is
&gt; &gt; for the 2.0 on my 77 westy.
