&gt;I only lift the longblock onto my workbench, not the whole engine.
&gt;The longblock weighs around 150 lbs, less without the flywheel which I
&gt;usually remove first.  I only do this if there is nobody available to help,
&gt;and I follow the proper lifting procedures (i.e. legs, not back).

Yeah I do this too. There's usually no one to help, so I remove the engine
from the van in the street, then tear down the motor to the longblock, put it
on a dolley, wheel it to the front steps, then I have to carry it up the stairs, put
it back on the dolley, wheel it into the apartment, then have to lift it again to
get it on the workbench. Its not so bad without the flywheel. I also remove
the valve covers so I can get a good grip.

&gt;Third, working on the engine on the floor is probably okay for minor
&gt;repairs, but I prefer to have the engine on a bench for bigger jobs like
&gt;piston/cylinder removal  and engine rebuilding, as I am in a more
&gt;comfortable position and have better light and a cleaner work area.

Once the longblock is together again I put it back on the dolley and continue
reassembly from that point near the floor, wheel the full motor outside to the
top of the front steps, lay down my greased board over the steps, pull the
engine onto the board, then get under it to prevent it from picking up speed
which is the hardest part, then when it gets down to the sidewalk I dolley it
to the bus, transfer to a floor jack, and its go engine in.
