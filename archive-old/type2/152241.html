Subject: Re: [T2] Hagerty Insurance

I don't know if my local State Farm Agent hooked me up or if it is State
Farm's normal policy but he gave me a great deal on my 1970 Westy. It was
less than Hagerty's quote. I have since sold the van but I I think it was
$70 year. It was less because I had it stored indoors and drive it less than
1000 miles a year. I did provide pictures and odometer readings to him. 

 

Wishing you many miles of smiles in you bus!

&gt; I have to say they where the only company who would give me an agreed 

&gt; policy for my bus that I called anyway. I have been glad to have it 

&gt; even if it is just for a piece of mind after the body restoration. 

&gt; Then I will up the value a bit when the new engine goes in this 

&gt; spring. I called Geico and they have nothing to offer you.

 

the only two folks that I found that would do a full coverage policy on the
bus was Met Life and Farmers. and both required all vehicles with them.  I
have an assigned value policy with Met Life.  Was with Farmers too but they
wouldn't let me put my daughter on the policy when she was old enough and
Met Life would..
