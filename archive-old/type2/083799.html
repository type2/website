&gt; Volks,
&gt; Since putting the new engine in Speedy after having it
&gt; out for 5 weeks, a few things happened.
&gt;
&gt; 1)  The fuel pump quit pumping.  I replaced the fuel
&gt; pump with a super-crappy replacement from the FLAPS,
&gt; but I'd like my old pump back.  The replacement has a
&gt; plastic foot for the rod to actuate against.  Ugh!

If it's a screw-together pump, you can get rebuild kits for it.
Otherwise, it's just a toss and replace proposition.

&gt; 2)  The 'GEN' light doesn't come on anymore.  Not sure
&gt; what wire's not connected anymore, and it still fires,
&gt; I assume because its a fresh battery.  Once it's out
&gt; of charge, I'm afraid I'll be stranded.

I'd be more afraid of cooking your engine.  The &quot;GEN&quot; light also tells you
when your fan belt breaks.  If you aren't warned of that, you will damage
your engine.  Fix the generator light before driving the bus at all!
Start by checking the bulb!
