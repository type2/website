glad it worked out

use the razor blade.
fresh sharp blade, single edge, don't bleed on your new paint

&gt; First off, thanks to everyone that replied to my question, even those who had
&gt; not-so-nice things to say, you shall remain nameless.  I even got a, &quot;
&gt; 
&gt; The general consensus seems to be either incompatible primer/paint combo,
&gt; i.e.. mixing acrylic and enamel (even if both are same brand) ; or oil, grease,
&gt; dirt, whatever under the paint.
&gt; 
&gt; So I re-sanded where I needed and tried again.  Using the same primer, which
&gt; I don't think was the problem, and a Krylon (instead of the Rust-o-leum) top 
&gt; coat and this seems to have worked.  It's not perfect.  It's not a factory new 
&gt; job.  But I can be happy with it.
&gt; 
&gt; BUT, I did get a little carried away with trying difference things and got a bit 
&gt; of over spray on the window.  Now that it's dry, what the best way to remove
&gt; it?  Razor blade?  Some chemical product?
&gt; 
&gt; Again, thanks for all the replies.
