Subject: RE: [T2] Tires,  Bottom Line

&gt; Bridgestone 268917 603V  185R14  TLBL  PS D.
&gt; Is an excellent tire for my 1971 Westfalia Camper.


The Bridgestones were the last tires I used before I bought my first set of
Hankooks many years ago. I really liked them on dry roads. They handled well
and had a comfortable ride, not overly stiff like some tires. I remember
feeling that they were an improvement over the Continentals that I'd been
using previously. My only major criticism about them was that they weren't
so great on wet or icy roads. They hydroplaned much more easily than the
Hankooks. Still, not a bad tire if you can find them at a low price,
especially if you live in a warm, dry climate.
