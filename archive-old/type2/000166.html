I am trying to sell my pop-top canvas one more time ok here it goes

i have a pop-top canvas from a 76 westy with a small tear in it but canvas is 
in good  shape and very useable. I only want 80 bucks for it plus a little 
for shipping is this to much? compared to a brand new one at around 300. Well 
please someone buy it i want to get rid of it i have no use for it right now. 
Thanks
