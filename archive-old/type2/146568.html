Subject: Re: [T2] A really stupid question

Hi Cliff,

I was thinking the same thing about the O2 sensor, but just had a  
look in the vanagon Bentley... On page 24.16 it says that only the  
Californian aircooled engines had an O2 sensor.

&gt; one.  Likewise, your California model has an oxygen
&gt; sensor the federal models were not fitted with (until
&gt; a year later).

Are you and I right, or is mister Bentley wrong?

Happy trails,
