Subject:  '77 to '81 Engine swap

I found a good looking '80-82.5 Westy that needs an engine.  I have a '77 type
4 that runs well.  My research shows that the differences between the two
engines in long block form are the hydraulic valves and the heads with
breathers on the '80 engine and not on the '77.  Can that stuff be swapped
over to the '77?  Anything else I need to consider?

TIA
