I just ran across two Adventure Wagon Camper conversions in Boulder,
CO.  Actually, one isn't for sale, as the guy doesn't have the title and
has no desire to pursue getting the title.  The bus was impounded and
sold to him w/o the title by the police.  So, if anyone is looking for a
high top to put on a late model bus, or an adventure wagon to buy, let
me know and I'll hook you up with the guys phone number.

I'm a bit upset that the guy is going to strip the one bus and send the
carcass off to the crusher a it's in better shape than most busses here.
