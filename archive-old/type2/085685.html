Subject: Engine cutting out.

Hi guys I have a 1976 Wesfalia. I live in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. I have 
been experiencing a problem with my bus. When I am driving it... it will be 
running well and then suddenly the engine will die. It just stops running. I 
have to turn the key off and then restart the bus and continue driving. This 
has been happening almost regularly. Every 10 or 15 minutes. Any ideas? Does 
this sound like an electrical problem?

Thanks,

Matt
