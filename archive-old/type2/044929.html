Subject: Re: [T2] No brake lights!

&gt; My brake light are not working on my 1977 bus. Here's what I've done; found
&gt; brake switch on brake Master cylinder, unhooked the wire harness from one
&gt; switch that has three prongs with ign on wired across, brake lights work? It
&gt; started to rain so haven't tried the other switch. I think this means the
&gt; switch is bad but I'm confused with the two switches? Does this mean both
&gt; are bad(seems unlikely) do both have to be good for the brake lights to
&gt; work? Also not sure what the other prong does on the switch? How hard is it
&gt; to bleed the brakes and any tips if I need to replace the switches.

This happened to me on a Bug--same setup so this applies here.

Brake lights didn't work when brake pedal was depressed.

Disconnected wires from switch and shorted across; lights worked fine.

Hooked ohmmeter to brake light switch and depressed pedal. Resistance went
to zero ohms--exactly what it's supposed to do.

Reconnected wires to switch and depressed pedal. No lights.

Mechanic now depressed. How the hell can this be happening?

Cleaned contacts on switch and push-ons in plug. Reconnected. No lights.

Reshorted the connector. Lights on.

Cut off plug and replaced it with three push-ons. Reconnected. Still no
lights.

Touched the two outside push-ons (the middle one goes to the no-brakes
warning light in the cab) together--lights on.

We're now up to obscenities.

I finally wound up putting a Radio Shack 30-amp foglight relay in...coil
prongs on relay go from hot wire on horn to brake light switch to relay to
ground. Wires to brake lights go to the other two prongs on the relay. I
found a good place to secure the relay and attached it. Turned on key and
depressed pedal. Now the lights work fine.

Depression gone. All well.

If you decide to change the switch itself, bleeding the brakes is not a hard
task if you have two people. I like putting the vehicle on jackstands and
removing the tires, because you don't have to crawl around under the car if
you do. But that's optional.
