&gt;Prior to send by mail my injectors to a shop (thanks for  the link Mark 
&gt;BTW), I am wondering if anyone know a place I can go in the bay area ?

I used Cruzin Performance about a year ago. The results were excellent:

Most injectors don't need cleaning. I let my bus sit for several years and the cleaning helped me increase my top end power.

Too bad the local shops don't frequent the list. They could learn a thing or two.

You could get them done locally in San Jose, but be prepared to pay double vs. mailing them to Cruzin:
