Subject: Re: [T2] help..tranny problems...in santa cruz (digest mode)

&gt; i'm in scott's valley, ca and i'm having tranny
&gt; problems. i just had my automatic tranny rebuilt (all
&gt; but the throttle body) 3 weeks ago and i started
&gt; having problems 4 days ago.
i was going to try to call the old
&gt; volks home (soquel, ca) in the morning.

Old Volks Home has a good reputation locally and judging by the number of
vanagons they service (I drive by every day) I would guess that they have
lots of automatic tranny experience.
