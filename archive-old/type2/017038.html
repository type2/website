Subject: howdy and diagnostic Q 009 dist setting 1700cctypeIV

Hi, Duncan (Ive been off and on the list before) still have a 72 weekend
westy with a 1700 motor. Love that lack of access hatch.

My problem: my distributer finally died (actually as I was regrinding
the distributer cam to make it so that the dwell would be even on all 4
cylanders, I just got fed up). put in a .009. Deffinately an improvement
The duel vaccum beast would harply idle below 30DF, never got warm,
sucked to start on hills when it was new( the idle retard took a brisk
snap of th accelerator to disengage) . I set the 09  at 7 D BTDC, and
its running good at low RPMs, it hesitates at 40MPH and makest at 70MPH
(4k RPMS?) Its idling a little fast.

My Q is, I have the use of a garage (dry work space) but I dont have a
lot of time (employed, getting divorced with toddler visiting every day)
so I have to figure things  out in one day. I plan on adjusting the
valves etc. how do I determine the best setting for the dist w/o going
out on the highway and driving around town.

My .02s worth. if you have to buy a smog-cert dist. spend the big bucks,
get the top brand. My S(ch)ucks dist has cost me more time grief and
points then I care to think about.
