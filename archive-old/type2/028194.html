Hi Folks,

Having read so many great accounts of this year's EveryBus has made me 
envious of all who attended.  I really wanted to go, but couldn't find the 
time or the money to make it from Aspen, Colorado (unlike the gent who made 
it from Texas!).

I've been looking on the various VW Events lists, but have found few 
gatherings close by (within a 9-12hr drive in my '79), so I thought I would 
start my own!  It's just at the Big Idea stage at this point, but I think it 
could work -- if I could just figure out how to make it work.  If anybody 
has any experience with organizing this sort of thing, please contact me 
with suggestions, pitfalls, things to look forward to, things to look out 
for, etc.

Here's what I have so far:  Dates would be around July 4th (perhaps the 1st 
- 4th); location would be in Colorado, in the Aspen/Snowmass area; camping 
would be primitive (no hookups); events would include a caravan to a scenic 
or historic spot, Aspen's July 4th fireworks, and music of some sort; the 
event's Catchy Title could be Buses in the Mountains.

I still have to contact the Town Government to see if they would allow that 
sort of thing.  I also don't know how feasible it is to invite lots of Bus 
owners to drive a long way for a gathering.  But, I have a vision of a cool 
event here in a cool place (have I been looking at the EveryBus site too 
much?).

Thanks for any help,

Jason Upper
