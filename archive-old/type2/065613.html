Subject: Re: Fitting a muffler

Bob Wallace got it started by offering the following suggestion:

&gt;On my 1600 twin-port type 1 engine I found that it was made slightly easier
if
&gt;I slacked off the nuts that hold the input manifold on to the block. This 
&gt;enabled me to jiggle the input manifold a bit and made lining up the bolts 
&gt;for the pre-heat tube easier.



 rvanness_at_neuron.uchc_dot_edu responded with:

&gt;his might not be a good idea since the metal gaskets between the DP
&gt;manifold and head have raised compression areas--you might be setting
&gt;yourself up for future vacuum leaks by loosening and retorquing the
&gt;manifolds (maybe just overcaution here on my part, but I offer it anyway).
&gt;
&gt;I use various size screwdrivers as levers to coax the pre-heat tube on the
&gt;manifold to line up with the flange on the muffler.  Having 3 hands helps,
&gt;but a two handed person cursing profusely also works ;).
&gt;

Which prompted me to offer my two cents worth...

No, loosening the intake manifold is a very good idea... but it assumes new
manifold gaskets are installed.

If you think about it for a moment you'll see that on upright engines the
thickness and fit of the intake manifold gaskets have a critcal role in the
fit of the muffler due to the muffler fitting on the #2 &amp; #4 exhaust ports
providing the attachment for the intake manifold's heat riser.  

Lifting the intake manifold and replacing the gaskets whenever a new muffler
was fitted was standard practive at properly run VW dealerships.  We all
breathed a sigh of relief when the Dual Port engine was introduced since we
no longer had to loosen the end castings, only the center section.  This is
why you often saw a new set of split-type manifold boots come home with your
new muffler.

On the other hand, I have seen several examples of Brazilian mufflers with
the heat-riser flanges welded out of position, making it impossible to
install the muffler without first re-welding the flange.  This only occurs on
the mufflers using the inexpensive tube-type exhaust stacks.  German mufflers
continue to use exhaust stacks which incorporate the heat riser port in a
single casting.
