Subject: Problems with idle

Hi'ya all,
Last week I submitted a few questions concerning my '80 Vanagon's poor
performance, with issues like hesitation and stuttering while driving. Anyway,
I finally figured out the biggest culprit...My coil had gone sour on me. I had
purchased a new coil a few months back from a SLAP. They gave me a Bosch
silver coil that was made in Mexico. After investigating everything but the
coil, I finally noticed that my dwell meter was acting up all of a sudden
which gave me an excuse to test the coil's ohms. The HT (center) plug was not
even close to being in spec. So I walked a few miles to my local auto store
and had them get me a 'blue' coil instead. What a difference in power.

My only concern now is that upon pressing in the clutch to coast to a stop and
then accelerating again, my engine acts like it's flooded. I will admit that
while I was trying to figure out the initial problems, I began messing with
the air flow screw on my AFM. I noticed my idle was smoother when the screw
was practically all the way in. My question is..while I am coasting or
whatever, would my engine act like it is flooded since my air flow is less
with the AFM screw closed almost all the way? I believe it is one full turn
from the bottom. Or, is it something else? I would almost ignore the idea of a
vacuum leak since I have replaced all the hoses and added clamps on
everything. In need of some guidance.

PS. Could it be faulty fuel flow?
