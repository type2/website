Subject: Re: [T2] What's the deal with all the cheap busses FS recently?

From: &quot;Shawn Luft&quot; &lt;shawnagan_at_sympatico_dot_ca&gt;
&gt; &gt;All buses end up costing about $4000 by the end of a year's time

I was basically given our bus for free, for half of what it cost to tow it
to my place ($20.00).  It was out of gas and needed the battery charged.
It's chief problem was a slight oil leak that &quot;transmogrified&quot; into a major
leak in just a few weeks.  I probably should not have driven the bus for 6
months without the trip to the mech to get things straightened out.

It's now in the shop for an engine replacement that's costing $2000.00 with
all of the other things that have cropped up during the original work.
Worth the cost, but it's taking me forever to get the guy paid off.  I'd
really like to get my bus back...
