Subject: alignment done, problems still

I went to an alignment shop after replacing my tie-rods.  I new the adjustment would be off because the old ones were off and I simply counted out the threads on the old adjustable tie-rod in order to help set the new one.

The front toe was off by almost an inch pulling the wheels to the right.  The front camber was fine.  They told me because one tie-rod is non-adjustable my steering wheel is going to be rotated right a little and it is about 30 degrees.

First question: can I take off the steering wheel, re-align it horizontally and re-seat it?

Second question:  They measured the camber in the rear and it was -2 degrees instead of about -50.  They asked me about tire wear but I didn't notice any with my last set of tires.

Anyway, we went through the Bentley and the procedure was to reset the rear torsion bars which they do at their shop.  What should I do?
