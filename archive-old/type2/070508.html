Subject: Re: Split:Ventilation Cover Screws

One of the screws for the overhead ventilation cover plate on my
'67 Deluxe broke off.  I have drilled it out (carefully) and
would like to run a tap through it before replacing the screw.

Problem:  Even the Type 2 _Parts List_ doesn't appear to list
this screw so I can confirm the thread specs.  Illustration A38
has the cover, the flaps, the knobs etc., but not the screw.
Being familiar with the _Parts List_ I even looked for screws
&quot;nearby&quot; the part for the cover but to no avail.

ack-   my faith is once again being battered.  the -Parts List-   missing a
part, even if it is just a lowly screw!    How sad!  How true!  I feel
betrayed!  How could they do this?
