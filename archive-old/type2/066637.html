 &gt; I want to buy her some after market,

So I wrote:

I got retractable seatbelts off some other VW (maybe an Audi?) at
my friendly neighborhood VW junkyard (back when I used to live near one...).
This was a well run FNVWJY, so everything was already off the cars and in a 
giant box of assorted seatbelts.

If fact, I've done this twice: Once for my '79 (may it rest in pieces),
and again for my '78 Westy. The '79 was easy: I found seatbelts that just
bolted in and I was done. Cost me - um- about $30 for a pair.

The '78 took some more doing: I couldn't find any more seatbelts that had the
requisite 90 degree bracket on the retractable end, so I had to manufacture
a bracket. Then I couldn't get old receivers to accept the new -um - thing
that pushes into the receivers because they were a tiny bit too thick.
So I filed one down by hand. Took a long time and was really tedious.
For the other one, I cut the old thing that fits into the receiver off my
stock belt and sewed it into the new one with mondo-thick car upholstery
thread. Took a little bit longer, but works better. My passengers
still sometimes joke that I should keep a razor sharp knife in the glove 
compartment so they can saw their way out of the seatbelt if they need to,
because the receiver can be a little sticky if you are impatient.
The receivers that came with the retractable seatbelts are the limp kind that
fall on the floor when disconnected and I wanted to use the stock receivers 
that are attached to flat metal that stands up straight when disconnected
so you don't have to go fishing every time you want to belt up.
In retrospect, maybe I should have used the floppy receivers and just
MacGiver-ed a way to hold them up in easy reach, like maybe with a strong
plastic tie looped through something or other.

I was once embarrassed because a dear friend of mine who is a little -um- 
*portly* could not fasten the seatbelt! I guess the distance from floor to 
shoulder harness attachment to receiver is a bit larger on the
bus than on the car the belts came off of. It's especially a problem if the 
seat is all the way forward.  So sometimes I wonder if these 
retractable seatbelts are actually worth the trouble. I've seen little
plastic spring-loaded doodads that will fit on the strap of the stock 
belts and roll up the slack pretty well. maybe I should have stayed stock
and shopped for a pair of those instead. I just do not dig the way the stock 
seatbelts fall out of the open door and ding the outside paint at every 
opportunity.

There might be a better way, but I bet it'll cost more.
Let us know if you find a way.

Drive safely,
Surfer Bob
