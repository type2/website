Warren (and Richard :),

Let me answer the question behind the question first.  Pardon me if I am
reading in something that is not there.  *Usually* when I hear this
question, the implication is that the bus owner is pulling the e-brake
handle out to the stop and the e-brakes are still not holding.  That bus
owner is thinking, as a result, of tightening the nuts under the bus to
shorten the cable and get some e-brake function back.  This is the *wrong*
thing to do!!!

The brakes on VW buses are *not* self adjusting.  this self adjustment has
been standard for so long on most cars that we often take it for granted,
but on VWs part of your regular maintainance has to be to get under there
and adjust the brakes.

How to:

When I first buy a bus, I will usually replace the brakes.  that is the
shoes, wheel cylinders, and flex lines.  I inspect the metal lines as
well.  then I do the initial adjustment.

The first step in this is to back the e-brake cable nuts all the way off.
'Til they are at the end of the cable. Slack!!!

Step two is to adjust the shoes.  First, get both rear wheels up in the
air.  Jack stands!!!  (This is usally already true for me, as I have just
done the brakes on both sides).  During installation of the replacement
shoes, I will have freed up the frozen adjusters (they are not *always*
frozen, just 99% of the time :-), put some antisieze on the barrels
of the adjusters and adjuster screws, and backed the adjusters all the
way in.  Then I turn each of the four adjusters out ~10 &quot;clicks&quot;.  Spin
the wheels, see if they turn freely.  If they do, then go around again,
put another 10 clicks on each adjuster.  Once the wheels bind, get up in
the cab and stomp on the brakes 5-6 times and go back under the bus.  You
will find that both wheels turn freely at theis point.  Adjust them
another 5 clicks and they will probably bind again.  Stomp the brakes
again.  they *may* have come unbound, maybe not, but keep adjusting them
out 'til stomping the brakes does not unbind them.

At this point, you are ready to bleed the brakes, if needed.

after the brakes are bled, I back the adjusters off a notch or two, til
the wheel spins with a whisper of scrape.

Lastly, once the brakes are adjusted, I adjust the brake cables up front
to the point where there are less than 10 clicks from off to on.  VW says
6, I have never been that lucky.

Anyhow... the point here is that the brake cable is the *LAST* adjustemnt
to make *AFTER* you have adjusted the shoes at the wheels.  I cannot tell
you how may buses I have seen where one end of the shoe was worn to metal
and the other end was brand spanking new becasue the DPO had *never*
adjusted the brakes, just the e-brake cable!

As a side note, if you adjust the brakes for the first time in 10 years,
be prepared to adjust them again in a month and again in 3 months or so as
they wear quickly while recovering from abuse.
