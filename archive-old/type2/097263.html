Subject: Re: [T2] Air Cooled Vanagon Won't Start in cold weather

Chris:

Keeping your throttle wide open probably doesn't help; that's the technique
to use with a flooded engine when you want to give the engine more air to
burn the excess fuel.  A cold engine needs *more* fuel (i.e. a rich mixture)
to get itself started.

There's 3 devices explicitly involved in the &quot;cold start&quot; situation: the
thermo-time switch/cold start valve setup, the Temp Sensor I and the Temp
Sensor II.  These 3 things would be the first items to check.  Too, if you
have a vacuum leak somewhere the excess air it's providing can lean out your
mixture, causing hard starts in cold situations.

&gt; Here in Toronto it is -4C or -10C with the wind chill, I am
&gt; not sure what that is in degrees F but trust me its cold. I
&gt; have been having this problem for a while and today it
&gt; finally gave up.
&gt;
&gt; I can hear the van turning over but it doesn't &quot;catch&quot;. If I
&gt; keep my foot on the throttle and keek the key turned to
&gt; start the engine almost, but doesn't quite, start. When it
&gt; was slightly warmer the same thing was happening but it
&gt; would eventually start.
