Subject: CA SMOG REPORT (NOT)

Went to &quot;autohause&quot; the vw/porsche/audi place in town that does smog.

Told the guy I had a 76 with a 79 engine. He said &quot;you shouldn't have told me that&quot;

Aren't these guys supposed to check that anyway?

He told me since I didn't have an &quot;engine swap sticker&quot; that he'd have to go by the book and bust me for my lack of egr.

He said the smog ref might let me off because I have factory electronic ignition, though it isn't required.

The ref would give me the sticker which would tell the shop how to smog my bus.

Is this making sense to the CA smog crowd?

Should I go through with this or just walk in to a no-name station and probably fail?

Billy
