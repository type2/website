Subject: Block Sand?

Hi guys,

    Well got all the paint off the car now. Found some more dismal spots
like the left quarter panel  with 1/8 inch of bondo,but nothing that's not
fixable! I'd rather have a car full of bondo then rust. I ended up using a
Chicago Pneumatic 6&quot; dual action orbital sander with 40 grit paper. Started
out using this dumpy 1/2hp compressor with a 5 gallon tank but it couldn't
keep up, so I switched to a 8hp h**da air compressor and that did the trick.
My hands are numb but other than that things went good. Gotta love the
feeling of standing back and looking at  that nice shiny metal like it was
some 38 years ago in wolfsburg! I think a cool effect, but one that would
take sooooo much effort would be to strip a car to bare metal and then clear
coat it. Anyways on to my questions.

    This is going to be a daily driver but I am trying to build it  in such
a way so it will hold its own at a show too, not something to win trophies
with but something I can take and not have people mumble &quot;whats that doing
here&quot;.  Now I've done body work before but it was just on beaters and my
baja so nothing was to critical. The way I've always block sanded before was
to spray it with primer(gray)  and then do a very light dusting of black
over top, and then attack the area with some 120ish grit sand paper using a
sponge as a sanding block on curved pieces like the roof and straight blocks
on spots like the doors and quarter panels. If I am correct the theory goes
that if the panel is straight you should be able to sand off all the black
without taking the gray off, correct? and of course any spots that are left
black are  low, and any that are bare metal are high. Its not that this
stuff is hard it just takes mega time to get things nice and straight
especially on old cars. Oh and if anyone as any other tips on doing body
work pass them  along to!!! well all fer now
