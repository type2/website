Hmmm...

I never feel comfortable getting underneath a car unless I have at least one
tire chocked.

Neutral is a given. Got to turn the pulley without the bus running away.

Brake vs. Chocks. If you're under your bus, and your kids decide to go into
the cab for any reason, which would you feel better with?

As with the &quot;Do not use this blow dryer in the shower&quot; warning, the chocks
instruction might have started AFTER someone's parking brake snapped (or got
disengaged by their loving toddler), causing a head to blow.

Use Chocks.

&gt; Part of the instructions for the valve adjustment is to chock the tires,
&gt; put the vehicle in neutral, and disengage the parking brake. What does
&gt; this accomplish as re: the valves?
