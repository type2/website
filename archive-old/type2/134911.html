Subject: Re: [T2] Bay westie side tent poles

From: &quot;doc ric&quot; &lt;uncleric_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;
&gt; Is anyone reproducing them? I have two good tents and the top corner parts
&gt; are broken on both. I have not yet compared them side by side to see if I
&gt; might be lucky enough to have one good set between the two.

Are these plastic tips on the poles that you're referring to?

I've finally gotten my casting business back into the black.  Now to get all
of my projects back on the front burner.
