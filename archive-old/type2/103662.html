Subject: Re: [T2] Need wiring harness install help

If you are not concerned about what it looks like
under the bus, use the electrical conduic from your
local hardware(Lowes, Ace, Depo). A little paint on it
and it looks good. It can be held up just like in the
houses, cut to length and formed to fit. Phil
