Yes, my RMMW replacement boots started cracking in a few weeks, now one has 
completely torn through, and as you might guess, I aint too happy about it. 
I'm sure they'll live up to the lifetime warranty, but screw that, I'm pissed 
about the Saturday I'll have to give up to do a very nasty job over again 
long before I should have had to. And even after several days and many 
showers, that cv grease smell never seems to go away.       Jeff S.

PS. I think I'll ask for a refund rather than replacements, why would I want 
the same sh*t again? I've heard Rockford makes a good boot. Any suggestions?
