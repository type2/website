Subject: Vanagons in Song

I heard a song recently that included &quot;Vanagon&quot; in the very first 
line.  Song titled &quot;Girls of Boise&quot; by Brian McMahon.  Did a quick 
'net search and came up empty.  Heard it on my local community radio 
station on a show that presents REAL alternative music, not the 
commercialized 'Alternative Rock' stuff.  It may be very difficult to 
locate.  Interesting song overall, but to actually have a VW model
mentioned is nice.
