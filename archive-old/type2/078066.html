Subject: smokey cab

gang,

matty here. i am now under a new email address, just
in case anyone cared. i sold my vanagon to buy my 76
westy, so the vanagonman16 thing just wasn't
appropriate anymore.

at any rate, today i was driving my bus. as it was
cold out, i had the heat all the way up, trying to get
whatever heat i could(not much). all of a sudden smoke
started pouring out of the vents on the dash, filling
the cab with a decent ammount of smoke. remembering
the recent thread about engine fires i geaked, pulled
over and checked for flamage. nothing. the smoking
eventually stopped, and there seems to be no more
problem. does anyone out there have any ideas as to
what may have caused this? 

thanks in advance, and thanks to anyone who has
responded to one of my many cries for help in the
past. i realise that that is the whole idea of this
list, however i still really appreciate it! later.

Matty
76 Westy &quot;Cleopatra 16&quot;
