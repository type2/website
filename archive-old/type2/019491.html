Hi,

When I recently signed on to the A.I.R.S. list I was given several options as to:
coffee and chat, available camping, available room, place to work, can do work,
have parts, what kind of beer I like, I have not made much on the corner with my
&quot;Will work for beer&quot; sign yet.  Seems like the information is already available
and maybe it's time for us to review and edit our A.I.R.S. profiles. The recent
incident has given me pause and reinforced my desire to assist others in more than
just mechanical repairs and advice.  I am fortunate to have the space and the
time.  We can each only offer what we have and no one can ask any more.

Keep smiling,

Mike

&gt; &gt; I think way too many people see the AIRS list as just something to be used
&gt; &gt; when you &quot;break down&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; would really like to entertain this issue and discuss a &quot;host member camping
&gt; &gt; list&quot; for even travelers who aren't having problems with their busses.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Whatta ya say Wade?  Do we make a list of &quot;Campsite Driveways&quot; or simply
&gt; &gt; state it more strongly in the FAQ?
