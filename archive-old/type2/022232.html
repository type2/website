&gt;Was coming up US-131 from Grand Rapids and decided to stop in Rockford for
&gt;lunch.  On the rise a little bit before you get into town, there's a white
&gt;bus for sale.  Sign claims it's a '71; that looks about right to me.  I
&gt;didn't inspect it close, just a quick walk-around, but the body is in
&gt;pretty good shape -- almost no rust.  Amazing, for Michigan.  It's a
&gt;pop-top, but the interior is gone, stripped down to the metal.  The real
&gt;kicker, though, is that someone stuffed a '75 Pinto engine in the back,
&gt;then apparently lost interest in finishing the conversion.  Looks like
&gt;it's just hanging there on an adapter, the body hasn't been cut for a
&gt;radiator or anything.  They wanted what I thought was too much for a
&gt;non-runner ($700) but if you're looking for a straight, mostly rust-free
&gt;body and you can talk them down a bit this might be the ticket.

Sounds like if you put that one and my wrecked bus in eastern Ohio together
you'll have one pretty good camper. I'd do it myself if I had time.
