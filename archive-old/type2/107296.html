&gt; Thanks, George- but you sidesteppped the question whether an airbound
&gt; lifter can ever expand its air due to heat and cause a valve to not
&gt; close completely, as B Bob theorizes?

Hmmm, I _really_ doubt it.  Atmospheric pressure is about 15PSI.  Pressure
is porportional to temperature relative to absolute zero.  Assuming that
the air inside the lifter was at the oil temperature, it might reach an
absolute pressure of 23PSI, or half again as much as atmosphereic.  From
this we have to subtract atmospheric pressure to get 8PSI net pressure
difference.  Multiply this by the area of the lifter piston in square
inches to get the force exerted.  Since the lifter piston is less than a
square inch, the added force would be less than 8 pounds, much less than
the closed force from the valve springs.
