Subject: Gasket replacement for throttle body(This time from me, not Yahoo)

Ok everyone, Im the one that had the airleak where the throttle body
connects to the intake air manifold.  Well, took the throttle body out
and cleaned it all up.  Runs better now, although still has leak.  Got
the new gasket today from Joe and BustedBus  (Thanks Joe!)  I plan on
putting it in tonight, but had a couple questions.  One is that there
are three notches on the outside ring of the gasket.  Does it matter
where these are placed??  And two, should the gasket be prepped with
anything before I install it??  Thanks for the help everyone.
