I did my floor with a roofing tarlike material (two thin
coats). let it set up and then painted it with three coats
of hammerite. No smell. Use a fan when working with
hammerite unless you enjoy that light headed feeling that
comes from sniffing caustic materials.:-) Hammerite is
pretty bullet proof.
