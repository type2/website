Subject: Re: [T2] endpay problem

Craig,
That doesn't make sense.  If your endplay without the shims is .45 and 
two shims is .24, you should still have some endplay.  I would check 
that you don't have something else hitting your flywheel that is locking 
it up.  Also, make sure your crank moves easily in and out when the 
flywheel is not attached.

Did you split the case?

When I was first putting my engine together, it turned out that there 
was a washer on the engine mount that was hitting my flywheel and 
keeping it from going on straight.  Took me a while before I figured it out.
