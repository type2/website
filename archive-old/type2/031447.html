&gt;  I stopped by a local VW parts supplier today and asked what a rebuilt 78

&gt;   This left me wondering why the $1000 difference between that and the
&gt; prices I see for rebuilt 2 liters on the web and in the magazines .

&gt;    So I'm asking you: what kind of luck have you folks had with the &quot;mail
&gt; order&quot; rebuild shops?

don't get me started on GEX crap.

in any case I have a 78, shelled out $1600 for a GEX rebuild, it lasted
2392 miles and siezed.  to make a long story short I won the lawsuit
against GEX but still haven't been able to collect.

 finally broke down and did a local rebuild with a experienced local
machinist, (he did lower end, I did the top half) total when finished was
a little over $2500 but I have a decent 2 liter (I hope) however I did
have to get new heads, the ones from GEX that I rebuilt had soft valve
seats and they pulled through, so had to do it over.

 bite the bullet, get a decent rebuild, you won't regret it, and if anyone
mentions VW and GEX in the same sentence, shoot first and ask questions
later!
