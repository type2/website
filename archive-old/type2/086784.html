Subject: Re: [T2] Adding and Converting AC Systems


A/C info here.  I had passed the earlier a/c question on to a very good
friend of mine who is an refrigeration expert.  We worked at Volkswagen
Products Corporation designing a/c for a lot of v/w products in the early
70's.

Here is his reply...


The best way to update any R-12 A/C  system is
to replace the R-12  with a refrigerant named FREEZE 12.  No need to
change the oil or anything, and can be added right in with the existing
R-12..  The conversion to 134A  in an R-12 system never works right
becuase of the specific heats of the refrigerants is to diverse.  A 134A
system requires 30% more condensor than an R-12 system.  The condensor
conversion is too difficult.  The freeze12 is a blend of several
refrigerants and the blend is designed to deliver almost identical
performance as r12.

Cheers, dave

&gt; &lt;&lt; the condenser will mount between the frame rails under the truck and be

&gt; 
&gt; to get the same cooling you need to double the size of the condenser if you 
&gt; are using R134......
&gt; at least thats what  the Porsche shop in Vegas has found out.....
