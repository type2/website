I would have to agree, with previous post to list,
on stripping parts from vehicles....isn't it great to walk
into the salvage yard..and find the part you want..ripped.
or mangled to an unrecognizable piece of scrap, by some
uncaring people....

They wreck 5 parts to get 1 !!!  

And I guess this goes without saying...but it's  Friday...

..if you have the room...9 times out of 10..you are dollars
and parts ahead.if you can buy the whole vehicle.....

you'll buy the  2 or 3 parts you need  and I'll bet I can but the whole
vehicle for the same price...as your 2 or 3 parts !!

Been there..done that..many times!
