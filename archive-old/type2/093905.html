Subject: VW Trademarks

&lt;snip&gt;Did Andy Warhol have to get a license from Campbell's Soup Company to
do his famous soup can painting and sell it for hundreds of thousands of
dollars? I don't know, anyone have this info?!&lt;/snip&gt;

Hey- I can contribute something! My understanding is that The Campbell's
Soup company actually became AWARE of the idea of what could be done with
their trademark soup labels when Andy Warhol created his painting, and from
that point on they have spent a lot of money protecting their brand image. I
knew all that art history would be useful at some point.  

And I have a bus question... I have been planning on buying a bus for a
while now to be my daily driver... and now that I am very close to doing so
(might own her by this weekend), I am nervous because I have a pretty long
commute (25 miles each way).  Is it obnoxiously stupid for me to consider
using a bus in this way?  Does anyone do this?  Is there any special
maintenance considerations?

Thanks!

Kelly
