Subject: Re: [T2] New top end and low power

Yea Richard, i will. This time, i'm stuck with hydro lifter.... for now.
But i don't have much problem on Vanagon's with them, 1 to 1.5 turn IN 
and we are ok...
I also suspect valve not closing enough.

Thanks, Ben

&gt;&gt; Compression test and leak down tomorrow, but for now, i wouls like 
&gt;&gt; your advice on head VS power VS new piston &amp; sleeve.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
