Subject: BA-6 Gas Heater Part numbers?

Does anyone know where I can locate partnumbers for the BA-6? I was
thinking ETKA or whatever that source is called, but I don't know anything
about it or where to find it? I want to try to get some stuff from my
dealer but would like to try and get numbers first. I specifically need:

Temp Sensor- The thing that looks like an egg beater and goes in the output
duct.
Front Output duct, has hole for above mentioned sensor...
Maybe a new coil?
Recirc fan and duct flap that goes on the back (rear is rear) of the heater
to feed cabin air to the heater.

I know that parts for these things around MD/DC/VA area are rare as Hen's
Teeth but maybe someone out there can help . Another listee sold me the
heater and it is in great shape I just need a few bits to get it installed.
I am trying to do as stock an install as possible. Also if any of you folks
have this heater in your bus I would love to hear from you about it.
Advice, tips, warnings are welcomed.

TIA
