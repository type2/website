Subject: Re: [T2] hub caps

Guys,

I don't get it....if the good stuff isn't available, then get the crappy 
ones, clean them up really good and then:

Spray them with clear sealer
or
Powder coat them clear(inside and out)
or
Use the por-15 product called &quot;glisten&quot;.

Problem solved...hub caps that look good all the time

Next?

Oh, BTW, to make the replating story really good, I was quoted
$300 each to re-chrome my 78 Champagne edition bumpers....and a 6-8 month 
wait as they were so busy they didn't care about more work.  This was 
across the state line in Oklahoma.  I did notice in the Hemmings 
publication that re-chroming in places like Pennsylvania appeared to be 
much more reasonable.

Cheers, dave
