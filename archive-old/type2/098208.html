&gt; The reason why I'm posting is that I was amazed at how much room  there
is 
&gt; in the cab area of the truck. Especially the crew seat. So what  years
were 
&gt; these vanagon trucks in production? This was a watercooled one...but 
did 
&gt; they make aircooled ones? Even though we're down here in Texas and  he 
&gt; bought it here, it was originally delivered to Canada. I've heard 
that's 
&gt; the place to look for one to bring to the states. Did they sell them 
in 
&gt; Mexico as well? I'm thinking one of these might be something I'd be 
&gt; interested in getting.
&gt; 
&gt; Any comments or experiences regarding these vehicles?
