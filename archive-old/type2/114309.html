First, due to DOT regulations, we can't import these to US.  If you are in 
another country, you better check your local regulations before buying.

Second, these guys are charging quite a markup.  6,999 british pounds plus 
shipping.  In USD that is $11,451.  If you buy it direct from VW Brazil, 
the published price is $8,930 USD.  For that $2,500 difference, you could 
fly to Brazil, buy your Kombi over there and even squeeze in a weeks 
vacation before taking the kombi to the docks for shipping.   I'm only 
commenting on the price difference here.  Others, I'm sure, will comment on 
the difficulties or ease of arranging shipping, etc.

Third, read the disclaimers on the site.  Not an authorized reseller of 
VW.  Not someone I'd want to buy a new vehicle from.


If you can figure out how to get them into the US legally, let me know.
