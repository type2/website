even tho the design of the jet is different.  the hole is exactly the same.
i have seen a number of 127.5 mains for example that looked very different
in outer appearance.  which means nothing in main jet size.

&gt; I have a new Mexican Brosol 34-3 carb and I need a bigger
&gt; main jet (at least, mabye an air correction jet as well)
&gt; due to lean running. I have a 125 main right now.
&gt;
&gt; I know that the original 34-Pict-3 carb jets are the same
&gt; as a yamaha motorcycle jet for the Yakumi carb. But,
&gt; the Brosol jets are not the same as the originals. They are
&gt; quite a bit smaller and sit down inside the jet hole instead
&gt; of on top like the originals.
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone know of a source for these kinds of jets?
