Subject: Re: [T2] CHT Temps - Comparisons

Those are the numbers my bus runs.. normally,,,
&gt;at 30 mph I had head temps of 300-325 at 50 mph - 350-375 at 60mph they were
reading 400-425&gt;

abnormally,, it will run cooler if:  there is a tail wind,, it is down hill ,,
ambient temps don't  really change the reading at all..
in fact... I was just thinking that the warmer the weather,, the cooler the
reading on the CHT,, and *I* think that is because of the errors in the hot
junction/ cold junction non-temp compensated VDO CHT

My Westy  will go up to about 70mph on a long run,, and it sits at 415 deg F
till I run uphill or have a side wind or head wind.. then it starts to
increase,, so I let off the gas pedal until it rides at just over the 400 mark
again...

&gt; It was about 90 degrees outside - at 30 mph I had head temps of 300-325 at 50
&gt; mph - 350-375 at 60mph they were reading 400-425
&gt; are these high or inline considering outside air temps and the weight packed
&gt; in
