Subject: Wheels, 100k and it's running!

1) Our blue '72 Bus just turned 100,000 miles!  We bought it with 87,000 or
so 1.5 years ago.

2) I finally got the 'new' '72 Bus, the one we're converting to 
a camper, running today.  Basically the carb (single) fell off the intake
runners because there was no bracket holding the carb up.  $4 for new
intake boots and a new battery and it fired up.

3) A question - will the wheels from a 1990 Vanagon fit our '72 Bus(es)?  I
thought I read that all Vanagon and Bay window Buses
could interchange wheels, but I could not find it in the archives.

Thanks
Dave
