Finally managed to tune the 34.3 &amp; stock carb to a reasonable level of 
driveability with the choke disconnected. After going around the block a 
dozen times decided to head upstate to check the condition of another van 
left in storage. 
Ride up was uneventual, 100 miles of sunday morning, temp 42 degrees outside, 
unknown inside. I watched the windshield movie. Lots of 'Buckle Up' signs I 
noticed as this bus has no front belt mounts, you can catch a view of the 
drivers tire if you lift the mat there, but if you do, you'll crash. First 
thing for my list, what sounds like a brake return spring rubbing on the 
right rear drum. the sound becomes constant. Stayed 55 in the right lane 
naturally. 2 and a half hours later, looking at the remants of what was once 
a nice looking 80 vanagon. Now with advanced rocker rot and a motor that the 
previous owner ruined (Me). depressed realizing it's on the verge and I put 
it there. got back in the 71 to start it right up and feel better, but it 
took a few too many turns before firing, hmmm. hot start prob? I head south 
out of the catskills again and pick up an intermittant half cough-half 
backfire on every other shiftdown from fourth to third. Feel the gnawing 
start in my neck. stop to get gas and had to short the starter to get it 
started again. great power speeds approaching 65 with the pedal only halfway 
down. Get home with mixed feelings though happy that the 71 ran admirably 
while pointing out some areas for improvement. Oil level was good with no 
dripping and the engine wasn't hot. belt wasn't chewed up. naptime.
