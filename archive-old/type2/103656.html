Subject: Re: [T2] Rear wheel bearing re and re

On my 82, removing the bearing housing was the easiest part of replacing the
bearings..... You might want to get the housing off and then take it to a
shop that has a hydraulic press to remove the old bearings because doing it
manually is both time consuming and is destructive of the old bearings.
Those old bearing races are TIGHT and it takes all sorts of pounding to get
them to come out. Of course, the loaf's bearing design might be different
and this may not apply to your situation.
