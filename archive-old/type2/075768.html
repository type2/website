Subject: Free haynes and cheap blaupunkt

Anyone want a haynes manual for 71-79 buses?
It complete with greasy finger marks and faded cover.
But its FREE--you pay shipping or trade me a similar
item for a early bay ('68) or late splittie or 1500
engine.

I also have a Blaupunkt AM-FM radio (no cassette),
circa 60s. It's exactly the same demensions as a
Sapphire and came out of a bone-yard bus. It's in
pretty good shape, all knobs and wires seem to be
there.

If anybody's interested, I'll make sure it works and
part with cheap/trade + shipping. (I'm saving for a
cheap cassette radio.) If it doesn't work, u can have
it for parts.
