&gt; For those of residing in California, I am sending information for the
&gt; Califonia State web site where I found
&gt; email information to express displeasure over SB285 which now makes us
&gt; subject to losing our vehicles if they can't pass Smog Check II.
&gt; Recycling your auto is not an option.  It's paperweight time.
&gt;
&gt; Let's flood the state offices with requests to appeal the bill .

I have read the law and I cannot find anything as you describe.  A post
&gt;from the CARB states the same.

I have found the following in this bill

1. exemptions for vehicles made before 1974.
2. exemptions for 30 yr old vehicles after 2003
3. If the vehicle is detected as a gross polluter by a roadside station,
you are required to have the vehicle tested at a test only facility and if
found to be in violation, you have 30 days to fix it or the fine
(&quot;administrative fee&quot;) starts accumulating at $5/day with a max of $500.
In addition, they can refuse to reregister your car.

I could find nothing about turning your car into a piece of scrap if it
fails testing as you imply.

This would effect the people that &quot;fix&quot; their car to pass smog and then
pull off all the smog equip once they leave the testing station.  I know a
guy that had a Hi-perf engine in his bug and had a spare stock engine with
all the smog stuff on it and when testing time comes around, out goes the
big one and in goes the clean one.

Before this becomes a on going thread on the bus list, please spend a
little more time researching this.

If you look closer to the history of the bill, its having trouble even
getting out of committee.
