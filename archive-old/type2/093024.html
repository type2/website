As it turns out, this one will be solved with just a front bushing and 
cleaning, lubing and adjusting the shifter. When I meet with her and after 
I get paid, cash or no keys, I will then explain to her the risk in trying 
to make it back to Kansas with this machine as is. It is apparent from a 
cursory look at the engine compartment that it has not seen a real mechanic 
since Hermes built a pyramid. Nothing but original failing parts and 
juris-rigous-maximus replacement ideas. Frankly, from the cancer all over 
the chassis, this is just a parts bus that happens to actually still be 
moving under it's own power. It never ceases to amaze me just how much 
abuse these busses will take before they quit, or kill someone.

You might consider moving to Germany, where Tu&quot;v will prevent those types 
of busses from driving legally on public roads.  I think you'd be a lot 
happier.
