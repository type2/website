&gt; From your post, this sounds about right, 8 watts = 0.5 amp draw.

Barry,

8 watts would be more like 0.7 amps.  Still not a lot.

&gt;Number #1 question:  If I had a fully charged battery when I pulled into a 
&gt;camp site, how long could I keep the 8 watt/ 0.5 amp drop light on before 
&gt;I drained the battery too low to start the fuel injected VW?

Assuming a reasonably sized battery in good shape, 12 hours at 0.7 amps 
shouldn't be a problem.  I still prefer a second battery.  :)

&gt;Number #2 question: 'about' how many lumens would a 7 watt 110 volt night 
&gt;light bulb put out, and how many lumens would I expect to get from the 8 
&gt;watt fluorescent drop light.

I don't know the conversion figures but in general an 8 watt flourescent 
light will put out considerably more lumens than a 7 watt incandescent 
night light, and the 8-watt flourescent is already set up to run on 12V.
