Subject: need undercarriage welder for my bus located im located in
  Bridgeport ct

well i went to my mechanic today for a general look under my bus and i found
out why my bus is saggin in the rear on eith side of the bus i guess there is
a torsion bar to raise or lower he rear end and i believe they are inside of a
metal tude correct me if i am wrong well anyway the tube is connected to the
frame or body. To make it short and sweet there rust on either end of the tube
and i believe thats whey she saggin and i thing it will get worse if i dont
