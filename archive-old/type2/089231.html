Subject: Retorque at 300 miles and you don't have to drop the engine

Well just for the record. On my 2L after the 300 mile retorque on the heads.
6 of 16 need tightening.  And some were on the top.  My engine had a stupid
weber progressive and I have to pull it off just to remove the engine anyway
(clearance issues) so after that and the manifolds were off it was just a
matter of a few sheet metal screws and we could get at all the bolts.
Without dropping the engine (73 and up has the upper lid)  I am usre it
would be a major pain on a 72 though.  I do recomend a second person to help
in reassembly of the tin as some of my pieces I had to have someone help
line them up on the bottom.  Also realized that we never tightened the carb
down the first time.... So glad we went thru it.

One problem though.  Stupid weber progressive is having fuel problems.
IDles really high, reset that and she dies at stop lights.  Just to double
check the idle screw on one of these is the one under the end of the
throttle cable facing you in the engine compartment as you look in. (right
side)  Or does that do something else?

Please give me any ideas on adjusting this thing as it is what is stopping
me from leaving town.

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
