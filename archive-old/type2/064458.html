&gt; hey, jonathan, thanks for all your sarcasm. actually, i could probably
&gt; get $7000 for it if i had the time to wait around. let's see: the new
&gt; engine was $3500, the brakes $800, the oil cooler, $300 the tires $150,
&gt; the kenwood system $600. that's $5350 right there, assuming that the rest
&gt; of the vehicle has no value. i never gave it any thought, but i suppose
&gt; these vans are in much greater demand out here. they are EXTREMELY
&gt; popular all along the west coast: SF, Boulder, Santa Cruz, Seattle...

Maybe I've been spoiled doing my own work, but $3500 for an engine????
$800 for the brakes???
and holy cow, $300 for an oil cooler that I can get for like $50????
Do these prices seem incredibly high to anyone else? For $800, I hope every
single component of the brake system was replaced.
This is not intended as a personal attack at all, I am just amazed at the level
of expense....
Sheesh, I could rebuild my engine at least 3 times from scratch for that
amount.
Just another reason to stay with my trusty '67....
  I rebuilt the entire brake system, paid for the bus itself, put in a new
engine, then rebuilt the bottom end, put in new carb, distributor, and all that
stuff, completely rebuilt the interior, paneling, curtains, etc.. new drag
link, and a bunch of other stuff I don't recall off the top of my head for
right about $2500. I could probably actually sell my bus for more than that, if
it didn't have that lovely red, white, and blue paint job.
Anyway, I'd love to hear other's bus costs...
