&gt;Went to see a bus today. Mid 60's split. Been inside over 30 years. No rust.
&gt;10,000 on the odm.  Original paint very shiney! Belongs to a old eccentric
&gt;who said he bought it to play his old movies?? The guy bought it in germany
&gt;and thinks VW made a &quot;movie&quot; model. Give me a break.
&gt;
&gt;He has had in the family room of his very large (mansion) house all these
&gt;years and wifey making him get rid of it. He says he starts it every once in
&gt;a while to see if it runs and does fine. Who knows? The guy is pretty old.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, I bought it for cheap and gonna make a camper out of it. Anybody want
&gt;the insides? He says it all works. I will like the extra headroom.

DON'T DO IT!!!  Keep it original!!  Busses in that kind of condition are
extremly rare.  I'm sure if you ask, someone would trade you straight
across for a RESTORED camper bus!!

There are enough old butchered busses out there, you would have a bus that
would stand out at the car shows and across the country.

Please keep this bus origial, or trade it for something that you can use.

(or have we just been suckered into another April fool's joke?)
