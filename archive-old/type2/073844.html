Subject: Re: [T2] 78 2.0L

Should not be doing that.  The L-Jet system in our buses has no
functionality to support that type of behavior.  The pump will not run
unless the starter is cranking.  Then once the engine has started there is a
set of contacts in the AFM that close to keep the pump running.

As far as I know this is correct for all years of Bus FI (L-Jet).  Please
verify with your Bentley wiring diagrams.  MY '79 works properly, i.e. as
described above.  So did the '78 I had and so did the '81 Vanagon I had.

Now on some D-Jet systems (older FI systems, used on the VW Type 3/Type 4
but not VW Buses), it worked differently.  In the '74 Volvo with D-Jet that
I used to have, when the ignition was turned on, the control unit itself
would send a signal to the double relay to turn on the fuel pump for 2
seconds in order to bring pressure up in the system.  Then after that the
fuel pump would only come on again when the starter was cranking.  Still,
this system had no way to tell what the fuel pressure was and to shut off
the fuel pump when that pressure was reached, just as our Buses do not have
such a system.  It was just a timed signal.

In the L-Jet FI as used in our Buses, the ECU has no control whatsoever over
the fuel pump.

I have never seen a Bus FI system behave as described below.  I have seen
improperly wired Bus FI systems run the fuel pump anytime the key is on, but
this is not stock and indicates a wiring problem.

&gt; Karl,
&gt; My friends 79 runs up to pressure when the ignition is turned on, and
&gt; shuts off when that pressure is met.
&gt;
&gt; My Vanagon does the same thing---is a 78 that much different?
