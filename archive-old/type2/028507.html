Here's an easy way to adjust the valves for *any* engine with an even number
of cylinders and stock or near stock cam ramps.

1. Split the firing order in half and write one set below the other as:

1,4
3,2

2. As you rotate the engine, somewhere a pair of valves (intake and exhaust)
on the same cylinder will both be rocking at the same time.  At the exact
point of *coincident* movement of say #1 cylinder's valves in this case, you
adjust the valves of #3.  This method works for 6's and 8's exactly the
same, you just have to know the firing order (except on opposed cylinder
engines where it's obvious that the opposing cylinder gets adjusted as the
opposite cylinder's valves rock).

Now if you have a radical camshaft, you can adjust an opposing cylinder's
valves one at a time, when the opposite cylinder's valve is fully open.
That way you are on the heel of the cam for the valve being adjusted.

Wink, others:
I often wonder if the valve adjustment procedure IS understood by all who
attempt it.
(And I'm sure it is NOT, judging from what some people have written.)
Understand that each cylinder has TWO TDC's per cycle! That is, it takes TWO
complete revolutions to complete a cycle in a four-stroke cycle engine. (720
degrees)
When you want to adjust the valves the engine MUST be at IGNITION TDC for
that
cylinder. In other words, at the end of the compression- beginning of the
power
strokes.
The other TDC is at the end of the exhaust- beginning  of the intake
strokes.
Are we all together on this?
Any questions? Class?
