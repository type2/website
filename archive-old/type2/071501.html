Subject: 72 weekender for sale
Message-ID: &lt;de6a601d.252977c5_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I have a 72 weekender that I want to trade or sale. The body is in great 
shape and the floors are solid. The body is very strait an has very little 
rust. 
There is some rot in the lower doglegs but it is very fixable. All four 
corners are dent free as is the nose, As usual , under the front window will 
need repair but it isnt that bad and there is a dent on the driver side in 
the corner of the rocker and the rear pillar that has some plastic in it but 
it isnt that bad.
The cab floor is solid but has some swiss cheese in the normal corner areas, 
The cargo floor is super solid and almost perfect with no holes. The battery 
tray is there but looks like swiss cheese. 

It doesnt have a motor but i know where one is that could be purchaced.
This is a good solid van perfect for a resto.   I would like to trade it for 
Bug,ghia,thing,T-3 or other VW in similar condition or get $600 for it. 
Located in St Pete Florida
thanks------------Bryan
