&gt; used the coil-over shocks, and how many have experienced unsuccessful

The first thing I had to replace on my '70 Camper when I bought it in '84 
were the shocks.  I was enroute in my &quot;new&quot; bus to the Beartooth Mtns in 
Montana for a summer's worth of fieldwork hauling many 100's of lbs. of 
rocks and camping supplies up and down pretty rough terrain.  When the guy 
at the Speedy Muffler in Minneapolis suggested I get the heavy duty 
coil-overs for the back it seemed appropriate given what I was about to put 
this Bus through.  Plus, I think I remember him saying something about the 
ones that were on there were bottoming out.  I have to say, the coil-over 
shocks (and the suspension) survived another 2 summer's worth of abuse 
before I had to replace 'em (again, I went with the coil-overs).
