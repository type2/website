&gt; emoved all the wheels to start on brake reconditioning and discovered rot 
in 
&gt;  the front suspension.
&gt;  
&gt;  I'm looking into the underside of the front driver's side wheel well, and 
&gt;  what grins at me but rust...rot...rust-through. It is on the large plate 
&gt; that 
&gt;  holds the trailing arms, the shock, and the post that sticks out with the 
&gt;  rubber snubbers on it.
&gt;  
&gt;  The rust is in an S-shape, starting in front of that post, running down 
&gt; under 
&gt;  it and then curving around and under the lower torsion tube &quot;mouth&quot;. Only 
&gt;  about 15% of the lower tube has solid metal around it.
&gt;  
&gt;  Is this something that can be repaired with weld while in place? What is 
the 
&gt; 
&gt;  best fix?
&gt;  
&gt;  I'd like to hear about the entire range of available fixes. I usually end 
up 
&gt; 
&gt;  using the &quot;best&quot; fix, but I do like to hear about the groups experiences 
&gt; with 
&gt;  different techniques.
&gt;  
&gt;  As always, your fine answers are appreciated.

Well the 'best' repair would be a replacement good condition front axel.

It may be possible to weld up - it depends on your local vehicle inspection 
rules. You don't say were you live but in the UK as this would be covered by 
our annual inspection I would take the bus to the inspection station and ask 
them the feasibility of repair, it would be a shame to spend time and money 
on a repair which they would still fail.

It is quite possible that the condition of the tube it self is such that 
there is no good metal left in the tube to which a new plate can be welded.

When the idler pin box on my previous bus separated from the front axle and 
the axle was removed (to fit a replacement) the condition of the inner faces 
of the shock absorber towers was in far worse condition to the outer face; 
and this face cannot be seen unless the axle is removed.

So if you have serious rust in the section of the front axle which secures 
the two tubes in place I would seriously dought if any where would want to 
repair it with the axle in the van. If they did I think I would question the 
judgement of the shop and take the work elsewhere.

Remember they are putting their reputation and livelihood on the repair.
You may not sue if you die due to them doing a half of a repair but your life 
insurance company would almost certainly want to recover on the payout.

Good luck
