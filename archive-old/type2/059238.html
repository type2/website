Hi everyone,
   I would like to invite everyone to attend the 5th Annual VW Fest in
Mineola, MO this weekend. This is a campout only. No car show, although
there is a trophy for Best of Show. There is also no event fee. We take a
caravan to the German town of Herman, MO for Octoberfest. Camping is only
$10 per night / per unit.
   This is a Missouri Micros / NEATO sponsored event. For more details or
any questions p-mail me.

Hope to see you there,

Rick
65 EZ
NEATO
