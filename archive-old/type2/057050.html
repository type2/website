Just so no one gets too confused, this 23-window posting took place on
vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com not type2_at_type_dot_com ... I never posted to this list (I
figured anyone looking for 23-window would be on vintagebus).

Just happens that this one is only 10 minutes from me... Right on I405 in
Seattle.  I'm getting some photos for Rex in the morning, I'll put them up
if Rex OK's it.

BTW:  I'll use the opportunity -- I haven't posted on type2_at_type2_dot_com -- I'm
looking for a '67 or earlier Double Cab.  Best possible body for $3000 --
engine of no concern.  Will pay $4000 if engine is right.  On West Coast.
Any and all leads appreciated...

Thanks to Steve G.  his hot lead on the '61 23w he shared with the list has
turned into my latest old bus with a sunroof hole up top.
THANKS Steve and list.

ps (Clara, I'm coming to OLy the 22nd to get it, you home?)
