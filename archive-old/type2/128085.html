&gt; The general consensus on this list is that GEX is sure death and anyone

&gt; but they are not known for their longetivity.  See the original comments 
&gt; that you quoted below....had we known it was GEX...welll....

the one possible saving grace for the motor is it's a type 1 engine.
GEX seemed to be (IIRC) better at those style engines than the type 4
(which they seemed to have perfected the self destruction feature on).
I sure wouldn't count on it, but who knows.
