Dear Mike,

No kidding? That was our first bus's name way back when I was 4 years old
(had to watch for dinosaurs then). Dad thought he was being real cute naming
it that. You do know that there really is an omnibus (a really long bus for
passengers). Kind of silly to call ours that though since it's not *that*
long or all inclusive (omnibus trade bill, omnibus strategy session). It's
better than &quot;beetle bus&quot; which term I have always found distasteful for some
reason.

Chris and Gus the &quot;What do you mean by not that &quot;all inclusive&quot; since when
were we exclusive...&quot; Bus
