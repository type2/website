This does not really apply to several of the lists I am sending this to but 
I beg your patience and any help you might be able to give.

A little background. I am finishing up a '78 Westy and I am tired of the 
squirmy 14&quot; tires. I'm also tired of the tiny OEM tire look.

These buses are famous for wandering around in the wind and also because 
the 14&quot; passenger car-like wheels often get shod with passenger car 
strength tires. Mine was when I bought it.

I know there are appropriate tires of higher strength to help this, but 
again I want to spend my money on 15&quot; wheels and tires. I want about the 
same gear ratio as stock so no mondo mudder tires or rubber band tires.

What I have found is that the VW van shares it's 5x112mm lug pattern with 
almost nothing and absolutely nothing (found in the US commonly) with the 
same offset.

There are plenty of fancy wheels to be had but I'm interested in plain 
steel wheels for reasons of cost, care, and simplicity (so no one wants to 
steal them).

I do have a set of 15x6 cookie cutter wheels but they offer different but 
equally difficult problems in fitting them to this bus but if I was running 
944 hubs...

I can buy OEM steel Passat wheels from the Tire Rack for $25 a piece. In 
theory I should be able to buy them from a local Pick-a-part but the locals 
don't even know what a Passat is... I'm stuck in rusty Monte Carlo Hell. &lt;grin&gt;

In order to correct the Passat offset problem, I have to run spacers of 
about 13/16&quot;(21mm) by my math. The van requires hub centric wheels and the 
hub lip is only about 1/4&quot; of an inch thick. I see in a Porsche catalog 
cheap (that's a relative term!) spacers with no arrangement for hub centric 
support. This has left me wondering -- the Porsche cars are hub centric 
also I believe. This is bad though right, leaving the studs to support the 
weight of the vehicle --- right?

The other difference is that the Passat wheel has a smaller hub opening - a 
57.06mm center bore versus a 66.55mm for the VW bus wheel. If I can find 
ready made spacers I figure I can open the spacer opening (on the side that 
fits the VW) to the VW hub size and leave the front of the hub to fit the 
Passat wheel.

Okay I guess my questions are - spacers without arrangements for a hub 
centric fitting wheel is bad right?

Can anyone lead me to an Audi performance supplier? They use this same stud 
pattern and might use spacers more commonly.

Longer studs would still be safe I hope. The bus uses 14mm studs and will 
be say 13/16&quot; longer now. Should I bore everything out for the next larger 
diameter stud that I can find?

I know the extreme air cooled Beetle guys use 944 Porsche hubs and rotors 
and calipers on both ends of the cars. They use the 944 stub axle, hubs, 
axle nuts, and rotors and calipers. Has anyone given any thought to trying 
this on a bus? I don't have any more chance of finding 944 parts locally 
than I do Passats but I suppose I could use mail order. Mondo vented brakes 
on my bus wouldn't hurt my feelings!

Any idea what the necessary 944 parts would cost? (I ain't rich...but I 
would eat beans for a while to get this thing done right the first time...)

Any alternative solutions anyone might suggest?

Of course, this is probably handled best by p-mail where appropriate since 
on some lists VW Bus, Passat, and Audi are words of the devil &lt;grin&gt;.

I guess it is time to get myself into the University machine shop and start 
renewing acquaintances with the shop supervisor... &lt;grin&gt;

Thanks for any help any of you might be able to offer.
