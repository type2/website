On my 71, there is a somewhat elastic cord at the bottom, and you can tuck the
curtains behind it.

&gt; Hi Volks,

&gt; an aluminum curtain rod.  Well it's not really shaped like a rod, but what
&gt; else would I call it?  The rear hatch window has this same type of curtain
&gt; rod both above and below the window.  Is that what the side windows should
&gt; have, or was there something else at the bottom?  It seems like a lower
&gt; curtain rod would  hit the top of the table, but I'm not sure....
