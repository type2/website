Subject: Our new Adventurewagen! pics!! high-top

Hello,

Our house acquired a new 74 adventurewagen recently from a church going 
fella from Oregon. He ran a retreat or something like that along the coast. 
My roommates parents and her bought it there, and she drove it back here to 
SF after Xmas.

It was one of the cleanest busses I have seen, and was very impressed with 
its exterior right away. When she drove up, I did notice that it was 
backfiring a bit and made the suggestion to take it in to have the once-over 
(the one she should have had before making the purchase, but oh well). She 
took it to a place in Berkeley, Grifin motorwork, and they called back 
asking her how much she really loves this bus, because it was going to cost 
more in their opinion to fix it than its worth.

Wha? I even drove it around the block for a sec, and it seemed to run fine 
but they did a compression test on it, all four came up around 80. It has 
duel webber carbs from what I can see, and the oil breather tube that on 
mine goes to the fuel injection and on the other carbed bus we have seems to 
connect to the single carb on that one, doesn't go anywhere. There is 
noplace on those two carbs where you could even connecet it.
I am hoping that is what is causing all of the extra oil on the ground, but 
probably not. It has a lot of accessories, most of which are not currently 
hooked up, and a lot of stuff that we aren't sure what it was supposed to do 
in the first place.

Visit the above URL to see all sorts of pics of this new bus of ours... it 
will be sitting till we know what next to do with it, I guess it needs to 
have the motor rebuilt, and while I am enjoying learning how to work on 
these things I really don't think I am ready to take that project on myself 
just yet.

take a look , and let me know if you can identify some of the stuff I posted 
pics on. I ran out of camera juice when I was taking them, so I'll get some 
more of the interior tomorrow or so. I compressed the files, so they should 
load fairly quickly.
