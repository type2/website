Subject: Re: Re: [T2] Emissions Stuff / Fuel Lines

I have a rare factory 73 VW Bus with an 1800 in it!!!

Hehe. The previous owner of my Bus purchased a GEX (yeah, I know) rebuilt 1800, and a rebuilt 4-Speed manual for the Bus. It was really quite a buy...

for $1,200 bucks, I got a shell of a Bus that had just had all it's body work done to it, and had just gotten a paint job. It's not the best paint job in the world, but it's still decent. Since it has a permanent spot in the garage though, I never have to worry about rust or fading.

But, it also came with a rebuilt motor and a rebuilt transmission. 

The one thing I hate is body work... so all I really had to do with this Bus is buy stuff and install it.

&gt; 
&gt; Why do you say you have an 1800? Stock they came with 1700's, though my 73
&gt; had been upgraded to a 2.0 at some point...
