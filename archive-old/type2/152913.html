&gt; Several weeks ago, there was a thread on wheel balancing.  My 1969 Bay is
&gt; about
&gt; to get new tires... problem is, nobody around here has the adapter that
&gt; allows
&gt; the older &quot;drop centre&quot; wheel pattern -- large opening in the middle, 5
&gt; bolts
&gt; widely spaced -- to be used on their balancer.  The best suggestion is/was
&gt; to
&gt; find an old VW front brake drum and use this as an adapter.  The rear drum
&gt; (with small splined hole) will not fit.  This is my Friday post:

You might be able to find a shop that does &quot;on car wheel balancing&quot;...
That balances the entire assembly as a unit...But if it's not the shop
where you're buyin' your tires, you'll hafta pay for it...Also, if you go
this route, be sure to paint mark the rim and drum so if you have a
flat, you can return the wheel in its correct position... ;-)
