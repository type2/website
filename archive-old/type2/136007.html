Subject: Re: [T2] Generator pedestal breather tube question

&gt; On my '71 stock DP upright engine, there is a breather tube that goes from the
&gt; top of the generator pedestal (next to the oil filler) downward through the
&gt; tin to the underside of the engine. Originally there was a rubber thingy that
&gt; slips over the bottom opening of this tube. Does anyone know purpose of this
&gt; rubber piece and is it important?

this is just speculation, but the piece is kinda a fish mouth shape
that only opens when something goes through it one way (kinda like a
one way valve but not that perfect of a job). I suspect it keeps the
vacuum that is in the crankcase from sucking road muck and such into
the engine while providing a way for oil overflow to exit.
