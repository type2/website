Subject: 78 camper faucet
Message-ID: &lt;7jjp19$9hmt_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

I searched both archives for info, and though I saw this question asked, never saw an answer. Where can I find the 2 way faucet used in the late campers? The seat part of the city water side of the faucet has holes in it that I have soldered up twice, but the solder doesn't stick very well to the pot metal it is made out of. This is the lower half of the valve assembly.

I have replaced my regular pump with an on-demand pressurized RV pump and accumulator. My wife and I both like the controllability of using the valve instead of turning the switch and having the water shoot out. I will be adding a very small hot water heater as well (actually an instant hot water dispenser you would have at the kitchen sink).

Any sources for parts or replacements? 
Thanks Jeff
