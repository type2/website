&gt;Here's the problem with that theory--

It's not a theory.

&gt;Your asking a shock absorber to do the work of the suspension unit,
&gt;which is not only unsafe, it's not the long term solution.

Not true, the shock is only doing the job it was designed for.  If you read my message again, I was talking about gas-charged shocks, NOT coilover shocks (although I did compare them to coilovers).

&gt;A load leveller devise was intended to supplement the factory suspension
&gt;unit--not be the main carrier of the load.

Although this is a completely different subject, coilovers do not &quot;carry the main load&quot;.  They supplement the factory torsion bars!!!  But again, I was comparing stock shocks to gas-charged.  I did not tell anyone to go out and get coilovers.

&gt;The correct way to do this would be to first adjust the suspension unit
&gt;back to it's stock ride height, and then add the shock of your choice.

Gas shocks will raise the rear end vs. oil shocks.  Fact, not theory.

&gt;A shock absorber was designed to control the rebounding of the vehicle
&gt;after it wallows into a dip or hole--not be the vehicles main suspension
&gt;unit, or spring.

I didn't know you were a suspension expert.  But read my reply again - it is all factual and accurate.  If you disagree, please point out the specific inaccuracies so I may learn from your vast knowledge of suspension design. 

&gt;Not 100% correct----

Yes, it is.
Here is my 100% accurate post again:

&gt;Can't agree with you 100% Joel. When I swapped out my dead rear shocks
&gt;for KYB Gas-Adjusts a few years ago, the rear of the bus did come up a
&gt;little. I think it was 1/2&quot;, or about half the amount that the Monroe
&gt;coilover shocks raised it. Oil filled shocks will not affect ride height
&gt;but gas charged shocks do have a bit of lift associated with them. And
&gt;1/2&quot; is more than you think.
