Happy Wednesday all,

        I am just dropping a quick note for newbies or folks that just
plain never have visited www.Type2_dot_com on the net.  Our previous List Admin
guy, Ken Hooper, challenged me to taking on the task of dredging the
Internet for all online resources that were Type 2 related, old and new and
bind them into one online resource.  After about a year, the resource has
grown to almost 200 articles and locations.  

        In the last couple of days, I have heard people post questions to
the list like, &quot;Where do I find M-code decoders?&quot;, &quot;Where do I find
production numbers?&quot;  &quot;Where do I find pictures of a '65 Westy interior?&quot; 
I just bite my tongue when I hear questions like these because I have
hunted up this stuff for you and if the info wasnt online, I have html'ized
it and put it online.

        This &quot;Resource Library Online&quot; is even put into an &quot;easy to find
what you are looking for&quot; format similar to Muir's &quot;Idiot Guide&quot;.  No
complicated search programs here.  Also, images and backgrounds are used
sparingly, so load times are maximized.  It is located at:
http://ourworld_dot_compuserve_dot_com/homepages/JJRodgers1/library/library.htm or
there is a link to it from www.type2_dot_com.

         Some of the highlights include the &quot;Campers&quot; section which
includes pix and desciptions of every early Westfalia interior offered as
well as any info I have aquired on American conversion campers.  There is a
&quot;Members&quot; section that includes a listing of a majority of fellow Listees
and their respective websites and email addresses.  This allows you to get
a little background info on a fellow listee before maybe....sending them
some money for something...and the like.  And finally, the &quot;Identification&quot;
area has decoding m-codes, model year changes, part interchangeability and
so on.

        Your input is greatly invited.  And, keep in mind, this is OUR
resource so if you run accross any articles that you feel are pertinent to
OUR &quot;Library&quot;, let me know.  And vice-versa...if you find anything that you
think is plain &quot;crap&quot;, I wanna know.  This resource is only as good as WE
make it.

Thanks,

Josh Rodgers
