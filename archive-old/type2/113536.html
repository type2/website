If you actually take this stuff apart and inspect it, it is obviously make 
of cheese whiz. If you use it 3 weekends per year, it might last a few 
years. Most of it wouldn't last a week of all day service without giving 
up. I would much rather buy an old cast iron something at a garage sale and 
put $500 worth of my time/money in it restoring it than spend a dime for 
any current consumer item pretending to do the same work.

What is really sad is that there is no longer a large enough market for 
quality goods to be produced, so no one produces quality goods. Cheap is 
God to the masses. Just talked with a T-2 type today and he told me how he 
is on his 3rd rebuilt motor in 3 years. Four years ago I was too expensive 
for him. He's driving all over the western US and breaking down perpetually 
on the road. He's coming in tomorrow morning so I can try to sort out why 
it still doesn't run right. He has been to at least 3 different shops since 
the last motor install and it still is not right. What is sad about that?? 
It's TYPICAL, THE NORM. Cheap is as cheap does, and it's why they are 
perpetually poor and ever will be until they realize how much time/money 
they have wasted with an attitude that insures failure.
