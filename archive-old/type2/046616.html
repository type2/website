Subject: [T2] Remvoing fuel tank

I'm taking the fuel tank out of the 69 for a good cleaning before I install
engine/trans. I've got the nuts off the holding straps, the venting tube
comes off easily, but the filler hose is being very stubborn even with the
clamp's screw backed all the way out.

Anybody know any tricks got get this thing off, or do I need to just brute
strength it?
