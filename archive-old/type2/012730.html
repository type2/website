Subject: Few things I need
To: wetwesties_at_yahoogroups_dot_com, type2_at_type2_dot_com,
        vanagon list &lt;vanagon_at_GERRY.VANAGON.COM&gt;

Now that I am back on track with my Vanagon running well, I am looking for a
few things.
  I still need a Vanagon Diesel Oil pan and pump/pick up tube. 
I would also like to find a sliding door panel, tan with cordoroy inset for an
85 Wolfsburg Ed.
And, I am looking for a Sink/cabinet from a 68-75ish Westy. I would like to
find one that is beat up or rotten. All I need is the sink and the box for a
pattern. I plan to add an electric pump and make a new cabinet out of tan
Melamean to match the interior of the Westy. This will be a set up just like
the 68-73 Westy, but removable so I do not have to haul it around for daily
driving. My Westy is a pop top weekender, no sink, stove or fridge.
I could also use a cheap 1.8l or 2.0l Golf/Jetta/Rabbit GTI engine(or whole
car). 
Thanks
