check your idle control valve little cylindrical object screwed into the
carb wire running to the coil. to test pull and havce someone turn over the
vehicle while you watch the control valve should be moving up and down if
not it is bad and needs to be replaced cost $14.95 at BAP, the symptoms you
give where the same ones I was having with PADME and it ended up being the
control. hope it helps some. safe traveling

&gt; Thus spoke Ontrees M of ontrees_at_hotmail_dot_com on 5/6/01 2:35 PM:
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Symptoms (hmmm?): always starts immediately and idles high if cold -
choke
&gt; &gt; working fine,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; if you let it sit for a few minutes starts immediately when warm and
idles
&gt; &gt; fine at regular low idle speed - for about 30 seconds! then dies,
subsequent
&gt; &gt; immediate starts have the smae problem - until you let it sit for a few
&gt; &gt; minutes - then if idles fine
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; the only way to get it to idle and not stall is either revving the
engine OR
&gt; &gt; (INTERESTING PART HERE!) barely tap the accelerator OR back at the carb
&gt; &gt; barely jiggle (a couple millimeters, just barely or more) on the thrott
&gt;
&gt; Is the carb on the manifold tight (don't forget the bolt at the front of
the
&gt; flange)? How about the gasket?
