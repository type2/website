Subject: Q: What kind of trailer hitch for my '72 camper?

I know, I know.  You might think I'm nuts for towing ANYTHING with my
bus!  Don't worry.  It's a lightweight and small boat on a small trailer
and I'll only be towing it 1.5 miles once in the Spring and then again
in the Fall.

Having said that, does anyone know about any kind of hitch that will
mount to my bus without replacing the stock '72 bumper?
