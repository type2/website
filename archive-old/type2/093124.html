&gt;I want to change my oil in this engine, what do I clean the O'berg filter
&gt;with?  Is it cleanable?

The instructions that came with my Oberg read thusly:

Start by brushing and flushing the screen with cleaning solvent.  As a 
substitute
cleaning solution you may use carburetor cleaner, engine degreaser, brake and
electric motor cleaner, soap and hot water or virtually ANY degreasing type 
cleaner.
Gasoline may be used but is NOT RECOMMENDED due to its extreme flammability.
Finish the cleaning process by reverse flushing the screen with 
compressed-air or
pressurized cleaner.  Finally, check your cleaning job by holding the 
screen up to
a bright light.  By doing this you will be able to easily see if the screen 
is thoroughly
clean.  Do not be alarmed if the cleaning interval is frequent at first.

&gt;I have a (don't know what it's called) the extra oil reservoir...

The &quot;sump.&quot;

&gt;.....do I take the traditional screen out as well and clean it, or heck is 
&gt;that screen
&gt;still there with the extra oil thingy.

You'll have to look.  I removed the oil screen, when I installed the Oberg 
filter on
my bus.  That leaves room for a cow magnet to be hose clamped to the 
pick-up tube.

&gt;I love this bus stuff, new bus, new engine, new learning experiences!!

With a sump and an Oberg filter, you may have stumbled onto quite an engine.
