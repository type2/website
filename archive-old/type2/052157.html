Subject: [T2] Oil Leak

Hey Guys,

First, I'd like to thank everyone for their help in solving my Rubber Boot
problem.  I can't believe how much stuff I had to take off just to replace
the little Rubber Boot that goes between the oil dipstick guide and where it
actually goes in the crankcase.  Anyway, that is replaced and working fine.

However, now that I have refilled the Buss with oil and have her running, it
is doing something different.  When I first cranked it up, oil was coming
out of the exhaust.  Now, the exhaust is fairly smoky (white) and it sounds
like she is running a little rough.  Also, the oil light comes on when I
have the engine idling but goes off as soon as you press the accelerator.

Any ideas?

Thanks,

Darrin K. Pierce
