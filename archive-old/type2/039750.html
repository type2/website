Subject: MSHP Is going out of business

This is a friendly warning...stop any business dealings with Mark Stephens
High Performance. They are days away from closing their doors. Mark
Stephens has run up huge debts that he can't pay (He owes me over $9,000 in
website hosting/design). Mark's a good engine builder...just a horrible
business man.
