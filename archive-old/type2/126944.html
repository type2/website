Subject: RE: [T2] CDI question - Spark PLug Gap

&gt; The pointless ignition module is only half of a high output ignition
&gt; system. The other half is the coil.  You should only open your gap up if
&gt; you are running a hotter coil or using a CDI system. You need a higher
&gt; voltage to jump a bigger gap.

true but it is also the bigger gap that allows a higher voltage before
discharge. kind of the chicken and egg.

If you have a standard coil, keep the
&gt; standard gap. Yes, you may increase the gap a little with a standard
&gt; coil, but if you open it up too much, you run the risk of poor or no
&gt; spark. The original coil may not have the ability to create a good spark
&gt; across that increased gap.

right. leave it standard.


&gt; The original coil's voltage is/was limited by the mechanical points. A
&gt; pointless trigger mechanism (such as a pertronics unit) now allows you
&gt; to run a hotter (higher voltage) coil.

not quite right. the points are just a trigger system. you can run a
hotter coil or cdi with points just fine. the advantages of a pointless
system are. a) no dwell adjust b) they dont wear out (but they do break :)
) c) pretty immune to mechanical faults in the disributor like sloppy
shaft etc.


&gt; A better question to ask is what ignition upgrades (points, coil, CDI)
&gt; do people have installed? What spark plugs and associated gap are they
&gt; running. And where are they located? (Local atmospheric conditions make
&gt; a difference.)

for the record. ive run points and pertronix. cdi and not. and every
combination thereof. currently im back to points and bupassed cdi.
ive never opened the plug gap. i have bypassed the rotor resistor when
running the cdi. ive run standard bosch wires and not had a problem (maybe
due to not opening the plugs)

my feeling is that with the pertronix and cdi i always started a bit
easier and had just that feel of better response.
