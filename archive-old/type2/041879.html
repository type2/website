Subject: Re: pilot bearing removal

I just removed my pilot bearing yesterday. I ended up having to grind it down 
one side with a carbide bit, then getting at it with a chisel. Check the 
thread for &quot;Pilot bearing... what's left anyway...&quot; You'll have to go back a 
few pages. There are a few good suggestions there.
