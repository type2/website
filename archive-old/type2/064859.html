Subject: Strange Splitty dream

Well, folks....The list has finally driven me over the brink.  Last night I had
a rather bizarre dream involving a lot of volkswagens.  Not to tell the whole
dream (I couldn't anyway) the setting was Morgan City Louisiana.  I was there in
my vanagon, but somehow it got stolen.  As I looked around  for it I kept
encountering Split window VW vans.  They were multiplying like rabbits !  There
were endless variations of custom jobs, including one that had a big headlight
in the middle like a diesel locomotive.  There was a greyhound bus with a
splitty front clip welded on.  I even saw my old ghia driving around (rusty and
running like s**t) with the same guy I sold to driving it.  Eventually I broke
into tears as I was unable to find my Vanagon.   

Maybe I should unsubscribe!  John Jensen in Annapolis.
