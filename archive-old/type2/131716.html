Subject: Re: [T2] Fan Shroud Flaps and the HE Covers

Rob &quot;Hotdog&quot; Henley brought these to me as a loaner until I can get him some 
more. Pics 5-8 are of the covers. The rest are of my GEX clean up. One of 
the pics I put a scale next to them for refference.

Good luck,

&gt;From: John I need 'em too, but since I don't drive my bus in the winter, 
&gt;they aren't high
&gt;on my priority list. I might just make some up from some scrap metal.
