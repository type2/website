Subject: Camping Anyone?

Hey Folks,
       My plans this summer had included Buses Of The Corn, but for a variety of reasons (not the least of which is the price of gas!) I'm not going to make it. Instead, I'm going camping that weekend in Luray, Virginia, August 18-20. Anyone else out there interested in coming? There is at least one other bus, maybe two, coming along so far. The campground is kinda pricey at $38.00/night with water and electric, but it has 2 pools, water slide, and mini golf (all at extra cost though). The campground was voted &quot;Camping Resort of the Year&quot; in 2001, and &quot;Facility of the Year&quot; in 2003, for whatever that's worth. Here is the link to the campground:   http://www_dot_campluray_dot_com/

It's about 5 miles from Luray Caverns and close to Skyline Drive. Also, they DO NOT allow sharing sites. If you need any more info, please pmail me.    Thanks,    Jeff
