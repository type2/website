Subject: Re: Coupling Disc Safety Alert

&gt;Hello All,
&gt;Found a pretty obscure part this weekend on my bus
&gt;that could fail in a catastrophic way.  I checked
&gt;the archives and I could not see that it had been
&gt;brought up before.  Anyway, skip the rest of this
&gt;if you already know about the =93coupling disc=94, and
&gt;are sure yours is ok.  Recent  posts last week on
&gt;checking for rust where your steering box meets
&gt;the frame got me under the bus this weekend
&gt;(thanks, really appreciate the info this list
&gt;provides).  No rust but I did find my =93coupling
&gt;disc=94 cracked all the way thru around the bolt
&gt;holes.  This is a rubber, square shaped disc about
&gt;=BC inch thick.  If this broke completely I would
&gt;not be able to steer my bus.  

This is a very important part, and due to its location it's one of those 
gotchas that will bite you in the ass if you don't check it out every 
once in a while.  I had a coupling disc fail on my old '75 Beetle.  The 
symptom was that when turning the steering wheel, the wheel would not 
return to center on its own -- it would just stick there wherever I 
turned it.  When I got the front wheels off to see what was going on I 
saw the rubber coupling disc torn all the way through and literally 
being held together by a couple threads.  I was *this close* to losing 
all steering ability.  Nothing sucks worse than losing your steering :-(

So get out there and check that sucker out, it may save your ass.
