hello,

I cant explain the bug bashing, but the engine blow, there are certain
scenarios where it doesnt do much harm...

i could build an engine that wouldnt be a shame to blow up... out of
rejects in my garage.

warped case (with thrust surface ruined, line bored to .80 , bad crank,
cracked heads, cam with flat lobes, worn out oil pump etc.  Every part in
a vw engine has a finite lifespan.... and can be ruined to the point where
it will still function but no-one in their right mind would build it into
a new engine. And this is where the engine blow engines (hopefully) come
from.  If people are blowing up perfectly good used engines, shame on
them...

take care,

Steve
