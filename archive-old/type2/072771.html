&gt;This is Ken's wife, Erin, aka the cruise director. Steve Dolan just called
&gt;and said he's in Clines Corner, New Mexico headed very slowly toward
&gt;Albuquerque. He seems to be having a lot of trouble overheating and would
&gt;like to know if there is anyone in the area he could stay with tonight. He
&gt;will call back here for any responses at 11:30 cst when Ken is due home.
&gt;Please e-mail Ken asap so we can let him know something then.


Ken:  Please tell Steve(n) that I'll be in the four corners area (border
area of Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona)  Wednesday, Thursday, and
Friday.  Have him call me if he needs me to drop down and get him or
caravan to another destination.  I'll be leaving SLC Wednesday AM.

Home 801-295-0970  (I'll be checking my box while I'm gone)

Mobile (when there's an active cell)  801 726-1070

You had your &quot;greasey fingers&quot; in his engine last, what's causing his problems?


Have fun (or try too)
