Subject: Dyno test


They had a dyno day in town, so I had our 76 2000cc FI checked just for heck 
of it.
The graph print out shows 54HP at 4200RPM and 71 ft-lbs of torque at 3000RPM 
at the rear wheels.
The Bentley shows the GD engine to develop 67HP at 4200RPM and 101.0 ft-lbs 
of torque at 3000RPM.
Are these numbers acceptable for a rebuilt engine with 30,000 miles on it?
Thanks
Bucket
