Subject: Air Correction Jet

Couple quick questions about air correction jets:

1) Despite the name, the air correction jet injects fuel into the=20
carburator as opposed to air.
      I.E. It sprays fuel to correct the volume of air.  Is this =
correct?

2) As a result of (1), and the fact that as air correction jet numbers=20=

INCREASE as the size of the
	jet DECREASES, a 120z jet allows more fuel to pass through than =
a=20
150z jet.
	Correct?

3) Listmembers have posted a Mikuni (motorcycle carb) part number for=20
the mikuni jet which can be used to replace main jets in 34 Pict 3's=20
(N100/604-XXX where XXX is the jet size, IIRC) -- does anyone have a=20
mikuni part number which corresponds to the air correction=A0jet?
