    As a former resident of Boulder I would say you shouldn't have any
problems with the way she drives in the summer, just don't be in any
hurry  going up and down the hills. Boulder Canyon will put the fear of
God in you during some stretches of the ride down just don't race down
and it will be ok. If you are comfortable with deep snow, high winds and
temperatures cold enough to break Jeep steering wheels and plastic
windows then just insulate and buy a gas heater.
    I drove for two winters with my 68 Bug until I bought a 55 Willys
because I needed the room.
