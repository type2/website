&lt;&lt; so yes, there are teenagers who treat cars like schtuff, but there are 
others who
 are proud of them and treat them as best they can.  I think that was what you
 were trying to say, but not sure.
 I know Dan (from IL) has his hands full and enjoys working on his V-dubs 
too.  We
 both plan on making a career out of this stuff eventually.
 
 hope I'm not rambling too much ;-)
 
 adios

Isaiah:  

If my brush was too wide, I apologize.  Guys like you give me hope.  I had a 
neighbor who had two boys that could drive a gazillion miles, and fix 
everything if it broke.  But, I did say &quot;GIVE.&quot;  I believe that's the key.  

Anyhow, have a good Holiday season.

Frank
