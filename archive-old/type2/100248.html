Subject: Re: [T2] Stereo upgrade

I have an older Sony 10-disc changer in my bus, 4x40 watt, and it's plenty. 
You don't need a monster sound system in a bus, because the engine and road 
noise distort it enough that it'll sound pretty bad no matter what you do. 
(Unless you really crank it, but I don't want to go deaf just yet.) I got 
$10 5&quot; Optimus speakers at radio shack and installed them in the wood 
cabinet over the back seat, and they sound great. The 3&quot; speakers the PO 
installed in the door panels sound terrible, so whatever you do, put them 
someplace you can find room for reasonably large speakers. I've seen them on 
the kick panels, which seems like a good solution to me. I've also thought 
about adding a hanging speaker box to the dash, but that seemed like too 
much work for too little return. I'd rather just cut out a door panel or 
kick panel.

As for the unit itself, I've never had trouble with it skipping except on 
particularly bad roads at excessive speeds - it needs a real whollop to 
affect it. It's in the glove box now, but I plan to mount it on the floor in 
front eventually... when I get around to building a cabinet/console in 
between the seats. I've left it on the floor as a test, and it doesn't skip 
any more down there. As long as you get a reasonably good system, it should 
be fine for you as well.

&gt;I am almost finished with my restoration, the body and interior are done, 
&gt;now
&gt;just a few comforts.  Does anyone have experience with a multi disk CD
&gt;changer and additional front speakers?  I want to add both, but don't want 
&gt;to
&gt;cut into the panels if I can help it.  Is an amplifier needed to get better
&gt;sound quality?  I don't want to thump the neighbors, just hear quality
&gt;sounds.
