my clutch is slipping terribly right now....i have to replace it, my van is a 
72 manual 1700.
do i have to pull the engine out to replace this? all i am planning on is to 
replace the pp,bearing, disk. or can i do it by unbolting the trans....none 
of my manuals give a good explanation on this and i cant find too much online.

ALso, what do yall think about the pacesetter dual exaust with the 
glasspacked tips for my bus, looks cool. how does it perform?

and how does the timing advance with electronic ignition? i want the crane 
cams or petronix ignition, but i have a 009 dizzy...it bucks like hell coming 
right off of idle, but runs fine at all other speeds. how do the other 
ignition's control the advance? willl the new ignition maybe cure my 
'bucking'?
thanks all for my long questions...
Adam
