Subject: Re: [T2] hyd. valve adjst.

Wasn't Bob Donalds gonna post his hyd valve update to Bentley?  I sure
would like to see that.  Anyone know?

&gt; &gt;Fellow Vanagon types:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I have been reading the posts on adjusting lifters with interest, as I am
&gt; &gt;currently putting together an article on my experience with vanagon hydraulic
&gt; &gt;lifters. The vanagon book published by Bentley is about to be reprinted.
&gt; For &gt;years, Bentley Publishing has worked hard to review comments from the
&gt; those &gt;that have taken the time to write or phone things in that they felt
&gt; needed to &gt;be corrected or clarified every time the book is reprinted. The
&gt; next printing
&gt; &gt;will include some 50 changes. One of these changes will be about bleeding
&gt; &gt;and adjusting the hydraulic lifters. There were 2 versions of how to bleed
&gt; &gt;the air out of the hydraulic lifter before installation. They where on pages
&gt; &gt;15.7 and 15.24. both where confusing and vague. Bentley also has in the
&gt; &gt;vanagon CD (released last year) added what they call an &quot;editors note&quot;.
&gt; This &gt;note says, in part, that there is a problem with hydraulic lifters
&gt; becoming &gt;air bound and that preloading hydraulic valves should be
&gt; considered optional. &gt;This editors note will also be in the newest printing
&gt; of the big green book.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  With the help of Erin at AVP, plus the constant feedback from my
&gt; &gt;customers and the nice people of this list, I have come up with a simple
&gt; &gt;method for removing all the air from the hydraulic lifters prior to
&gt; &gt;installation. This method does not solve or prevent the lifters from pulling
&gt; &gt;in air after the engine has been sitting and it is not a solution for air
&gt; &gt;bound lifters that DO expand when the engine heats up. Air bound lifters DO
&gt; &gt;hold the valves when the engine warms up. The 006.ths clearance cold is
&gt; &gt;needed when air is present in the lifters 0 lash will not do. The most
&gt; common &gt;symptoms of air bound lifters are poor performance running rich and
&gt; low &gt;manifold vacuum. It has been my observation that preloading properly
&gt; bled &gt;lifters will self-adjust in as little as 10 minutes. It has been my
&gt; experience  &gt;that air bound lifters will NEVER self-adjust when preloaded
&gt; or bleed because &gt;of the air that is trapped above the check valve. The
&gt; extent of the problem &gt;varies widely. I know there will be those that
&gt; disagree with me. My completed &gt;article will be posted on my web site in
&gt; the very near future.
