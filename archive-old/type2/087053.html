&gt; Alway check your rear view mirror when slowing to a stop, especially when you are driving your recently restored and freshly painted 78 westy.

well I waited til Friday to answer 

&gt; I had literally had just gotten it back from the paint shop two weeks ago and the interior was just put back in.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope nobody else will have to go through this, but I'm probably not the only one that something like this has happened to.
&gt; But if you have a similar story, I might feel better if I heard it.

unfortunately I do,  some years ago when I first got my current 78 I had
did all the body work myself then painted it also myself...metalic Blue
lower bright white upper not VW stock colors but I liked it....not a month
later on I-81 near Wilkes-Barre PA at cruising speed I was passing a
tractor trailer on a steep upgrade when suddenly he started drifting
towards me.  I tried to slow down and moved left, and left onto the
shoulder and still he kept coming,  taking out my right side front and
rear corners...driver fell asleep at the wheel....state police said I was
lucky to be alive.    didn't even break my windshield but sure did a
number on the quarter panels and paint job.   ;8*{
