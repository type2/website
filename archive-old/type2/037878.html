&gt; Wierd theft story:
&gt; 
&gt; A friend i know had a nice 69 westy that became non-functional for whatever
&gt; reason.  
&gt; He parked it in the parking lot of the subshop he worked at.
&gt; The van was completely immobile - would not start.  
&gt; It sat there for several months until one day he came to work and it was gone
&gt; - just plain-old 'gone'. It had never been 'stickered' or anything.
&gt; 
&gt; He checked with everyone; boss, cops, landowner, family, friends etc -
&gt; nothing.
&gt; 
&gt; Somebody had to have hooked onto it and towed it off!

Pro car thieves commonly use tow trucks, even flatbeds, to do their dirty
work.  People don't pay any attention to tow trucks loading up, even with
alarms blaring.  It gets around all of the possible anti-theft strategies.
Only anti-tow thing I've learned is to park between two other cars and
turn the wheels as far as they will go.  If the tow truck cannot pull the
car from the space without hitting other cars then the thief might move
on.
&gt; 
&gt; Remember that Adam12 episode where the dudes stole the engine out of a
&gt; beetle?

It's pretty easy out of a baja bug.  They sell locking engine-tranny
bolts!
