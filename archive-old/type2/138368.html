Subject: Grounding the Engine.

Ok, my starter is turning too SLOW to start. I'm about to pop in a new
battery and new cables. Somewhere I read that the ground strap on the
Tranny may be loose. I'm wondering if it would be advantagous to get a
negitive battery cable with two leads. One lead to the chasis where
it's at by factory default, and one line to the engine/tranny for
direct ground to the battery.

TIA
Chris
