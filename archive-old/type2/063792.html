Subject: Possible Splittie purchase..have ?s 4 u

hey now,

well, while on vacation in an area of nc that shall remain unamed for obvious
reasons...i looked at a westy...all i know is that it's between 64-67. white,
square poptop. inspection sticker reads 2/96. no front seats. looks like
threw a rock through the front window. :-( body looks remarkably good, at least
one hole in the rocker panel...couldn't look under because of my fear of large
copperheads which are prevalent in this area of nc. engine looks like it's been
dismantled a bit, no carb. then again i don't know much about a splittie engine
so i don't know what was really missing. don't know if it runs. i like the
uprightness of the engine as compared to my pancake engine. interior looks
GREAT. it has several small lourve windows.

how much do seats cost? windows? assuming the engine does not run, how much
to rebuild if it needs it and how much should i offer? the body looks good
for an almost 30 year old van.

i'd like to say this van would be for me, but it's going to my fiancee if i
buy it and get it running. instead of an expensive engagement ring, i asked
if she would like a bus...and she said YES! a splittie no doubt!

thanks,

jonathan '74 RetroWestie (Rumba...son to have a sister?)
