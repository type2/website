Subject: Re: [T2] Help me get this nut off!!!

Tom,

Are you sure that the nut is stripped and not the stud?

Probably be easier to go down to the local &quot;ace&quot; hardware store and see if 
they have a stud of the right dimensions...or your local vwflaps.

Yes, you can cut and grind all day long on the nut, but if you hurt the 
threads on the stud, you are back in the same place....and if the stud is 
really stripped rather than the nit...same place again.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi all:
&gt; 
&gt; Wilson's book on rebuilding the air-cooled VW engine states that the torque
&gt; for the nut that holds the rocker arms to the stud is 18 ft.-lbs. which sure
&gt; *seemed* like a lot given the small size of the nut, but I didn't question
&gt; it until.....  the second of the nuts I snugged down began to &quot;stop
&gt; tightening&quot; even though I continued to crank on it.  (Looking at the Bentley
&gt; manual - too late! - revealed that it's really supposed to be tightened to
&gt; 11 ft.-lbs.)  When I reversed the nuts holding this particular rocker down
&gt; the nuts didn't come out - the studs did!
&gt; 
&gt; So, I went down and got the M10 nuts I needed, double-nutted the stud, and
&gt; succeeded in getting one of rocker arm nuts off.  But the other nut is
&gt; stripped and just spins.  I know there's &quot;nut-cracker&quot; tools you can use in
&gt; this case, but I'd rather not go buy this for a one-time deal.  I've got
&gt; cold chisels and hack saws and all kind of implements of destruction; how do
&gt; I use these items to get this nut off?
&gt; 
&gt; TIA.
