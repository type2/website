Subject: wide 5 14 inch wheels... 5 or 5.5?
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.21.0011080914170.16153-100000_at_zarf_dot_org&gt;

hello,

I had always thought that splitty wide 5 wheels were 5 inches wide and bay
wide 5 wheels were 5.5 inches wide...

But a friend of mine recently told me they are all 5 inches wide... i am
wanting to put bigger tires on a bus so the extra half inch would be
good... anyone know for sure which way this is or how to tell the
difference?

thanks,

Steve
