Subject: RE: [T2] kudos to one of our online vendors

&gt; A while back, I ordered a carpet set for Foster from Bus 
&gt; Depot.  ... A few weeks later, I got a carpet set from TMI, 
&gt; but they delivered a set for a '73 - '74 AT squareback, with
&gt; a note that they did not take returns since each set was 
&gt; custom made.  I called Bus Depot about this, and they 
&gt; said to just send it to them, and they would take care of 
&gt; the rest.
&gt; 
&gt; After another few weeks, I got the correct carpet set.  I 
&gt; don't know if Bus Depot was able to work anything out with 
&gt; TMI (I rather doubt it), but by golly, they were able to work 
&gt; things out with me.....they will continue to get my business. 
&gt; 
&gt; They probably have a '73 - '74 AT carpet in stock and ready 
&gt; to ship if anyone needs it.   :-)



Thanks so much for the positive words, Chris; they're really appreciated!
As you suspected, we're stuck with the AT one.  So if anyone can use it,
it's yours for half price.  Just p-mail me. (And please feel free to forward
this to the ACVW list, since I'm not a subscriber.)
