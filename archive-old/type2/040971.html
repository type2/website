Mine was off by 3 (from side to side; avg. of 1.5) Not too bad for
free:).

Maybe you could find an aluminum plate to start with.  Would be soft on
the P&amp;C's and is  commonly available in metric sizes.  BTW, the estimate
for surfacing sounds way expensive.  If you showed up with the plate cut
to size and marked for the holes they would probably drill and surface
the plate pretty cheap. My neighbor's son has a NICE machine shop behind
his house. If you get me some measurements I could check with him on a
price.
