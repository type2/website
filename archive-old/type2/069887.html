&gt;&gt; 1954 Ambulance bus. #20-072014. Very nice canidate for restoration or
&gt;&gt;    daily driver. Very little rust. Rust free nice original dog legs.

&gt;&gt;etc etc

&gt;Yep,
&gt;
&gt;Mark Merz was the man with the $10000 61 23 window (pretty clean but
&gt;unrestored - looks like he must have sold it though I haven't seen it
&gt;advertised for a while)......
&gt;
&gt;Given his top-of-the range asking prices I wouldn't  expect a lot of ambulance
&gt;for $5000.

I've seen this bus twice, and while it looks good from a distance, I
remember that it looked totally unrestored, and did have some cancerous
rust.  Still, busses like this don't come around every day (do they??).
