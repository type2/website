Subject: Re: [T2] 1971 Type 2 Engine Recommendations

Hi Martin,

Quick options: If you have the $$$, buy new. This investment will  
last a long long time.  If $$$ is a factor, you will get on the road  
quickest buying a known good used engine.

Cheap option: Rebuild it yourself. This will take longer, but since  
YOU are doing the job then you have control over the quality of  
components. You can then consider the option to build up to a 1776cc,  
1904cc or whatever strikes your fancy. Note that the cost of a  
rebuild can sometimes get right up there with the cost of a budget  
longblock.

No matter what you do, stay away from ANYTHING that has a GEX label  
on it.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
