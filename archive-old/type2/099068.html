&gt; how does the thermostat cable connect to the thermostat itself?
 
 I finally figured out what was causing my bus to run so hot. the
thermostat
 cable is GONE.
 
Take the little lever the cable clamps to and wiggle it forward and
back- (it's on the right side of the rod that connects the flappers on
both sides.  There is a locknut (8mm wrench) that holds the cable.  You
should notice it's spring loaded and with no cable, it keeps the flaps
wide open.  Verfy there is no friction as you work the flaps.  I ran my
78 bus to 150,000 mi this way (bought at 68 K, don't know when
thermostat developed a crack, which will relax it and never pull on the
cable.  It will affect warmup time and little else.
     The bus thermostat has a threaded collar that holds a cable which
is &quot;identical&quot; to a shifter cable you can get at a bike shop; you may
have to file the thickened end a bit to fit.  It's a pain to push the
cable through the tin from below, and in the past I pushed a cable or
wire through from above and glued/taped it to the real cable so it could
be &quot;fished&quot; through from above.
   Setting the cable adjustment is listed in Bentley; the thermostat is
fully relaxed at a certain hot temp and could be set that way, or set
the flaps shut when it's zero outside and verify they are fully open
when thermostat is fully stretched.
