I'd second that.  Unless you are lucky or are into backpacking to the back
country, Yellowstone is way crowded, and getting worse as the NPS
&quot;improves&quot; things.  We usually bypass it in favor of
Themopolis and Grand Teton.  Of course, if you haven't seen it, you should
probably check it out just to say you did!

Glacier is beautiful.  Stay in East Glacier (Sears Motel is reasonable and
bus-friendly) and go over the pass early in the day for the best lighting
on the Going-to-the-Sun road.
