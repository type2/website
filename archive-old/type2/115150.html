Subject: help finding part for sliding door

I've got sliding door problems on my '78. If I recall, there are two rollers 
on the bottom of the sliding door: one vertical to roll along the track, the 
other horizontal that rolls inside of the guide that sticks down from the 
top of the track.

I either lost or broke that horizontal roller. There's still a pin sticking 
up there, but no roller. Anyone know where I can get one, or the dimensions 
so I could get one made? I also can't remember if it was nylon or metal.

Also - the track itself is starting to sag, and the guide lip seems bent and 
worn. Anyone have luck fixing or replacing these parts?

Thanks
Mat
