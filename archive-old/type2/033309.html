Subject: Re: what defines bus sag ^&amp; torsion bar color

fwiw,
I have an original 76 westy (not an aftermarket/private conversion)
I re-set the torsion bars this summer.  When i pulled them out, sure
enough, they were red.
Not what Bentley said.  I compared them to another red set from a std
bus and they are the same diameter etc.
was VW out of the correct part that day?  Did they change their design?
Has anyone else w/ a &gt;76 done the torsion bars and found the &quot;non-red&quot;
bars (green?)

you wrote:
According to legend, there are actually two torsion bars for 68-79...
ones
w/ red paint on em for normal kombis, sedans, etc; one with brown or
green
(forget) to signify beefier camper torsies. Or were the colors reversed?

Anyways, as every bus I have ever stripped was a hard-top camper or a
sedan, all I've ever seen are the red ones.
