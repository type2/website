Sounds like VW trends has some space they couldn't sell to advertizers.
If you want to see genuine performance increase, research Vellum Chambers
and build an exhaust system that actually sucks the air-fuel mixture
through your engine. Kirker did a fair job on motorcycle mufflers with
the vellum effect and achieved some real performance increases, but with
low RPM engines it hasn't produced much of an increase.
