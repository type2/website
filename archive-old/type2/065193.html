Subject: Fuel filter upgrade

Hi everyone

I've asked a lot  of questions lately, so I thought it was time to repay with
a little story, if it helps anyone.

I had a persistent problem with my 78 westy when I first bought it.  The
previous po's were the proverbial little old Lady (&amp; man) and they only used
the bus to camp in the summer.  They were farmers, immigrants from germany,
and were very good about their cars.  They only drove german cars, and they
had about 9 different flavors on the farm.  The old man wasn't driving
anymore, and the old woman didn't want to be driving a stick, so they bought
an 86 Vanagon camper.  This is all just background.

When I bought the bus, it had been in their barn for over a year, and as I
said, only driven in summers.  In 8 years they had only put 16,000 miles on
it.  Unfortunately, with all of its storage, the fuel tank was rusting out on
the inside, and I was going through fuel filters at a high rate.  I was also
getting water in the tank.  So here's what I did.

I knew i would have to replace or recondition the tank at some point, but I
didnt want to drop the engine until I was ready.  In the meantime, I replaced
the fuel filter with a marine filter which I mounted (It's the size of an oil
filter) on the frame in front of the fuel filter.  I used brass fittings and
put a fuel shutoff petcock on the inlet.  The filter has a replacement
element that screws in, and on the bottom has a clear water trap with a
drain.  When I need to change the filter, i turn off the petcock,drain the
fuel from the filter into a can and remove it.  Very little mess.  I had been
taking the &quot;petrol shower&quot; for too long, and this cured it.

But, in order to cure the real problem, I knew I would have to fix the tank.
 I looked around but couldnt find a new one (at least not at a reasonable
price), so I dropped the engine (another story), and pulled the tank.  I
cleaned it using a kit from restomotive technologies (POR-15 people, no I
dont work for them etc.etc.) and used ther rust remover 'stuff' and their gas
tank sealer kit.  I also had some pinholes in the tank which i fixed with
some of that epoxy plumbers putty (but supposedly the sealer cures these as
well).  I put some of the sealer out to dry to see what it looks like, and
it's pretty cool.  Really thin, but really strong (I thought for sure it
would be too thin) and really slippery.  But it seems to have worked really
well.

I also replaced all the steel fuel lines with new, and painted them black to
avert rust.  I am now in the process of replacing all the FI hoses and such,
and repainting all the FI metal lines.  It looks much better.

I still have to finish up, but I expect the problem to be cured.  I do
recommend getting a marine fuel filter though.  It's very nice how it mounts
in, and very convenient.  The cost is a little high, (about $35 for the
filter, and $20 more for brass petcock etc.) but the convenience and
protection are worth it.  I also read the recent posts about the $90 filler
hose link (I read those after I had cut it out) and went and bought a new
piece today.  About $ 18  for a foot, and I only need 4 inches, so if anybody
needs a piece, maybe we can make a small trade.

I hope this has helped someone. ( I know it's wrong, but what I'm trying to
do is build up my internet Karma, so that some of you will answer my previous
questions from today.  At least those of you still reading.)
