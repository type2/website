Well, I finished helping friend clean out his dad's old shop today.
Brought home four early cases, besides the four boxes of &quot;stuff&quot; I got
earlier.  Also ended up stripping an old 67 beetle for extra &quot;stuff&quot; for
my 67.  I'll let everyone know what the cases are for as soon as I
decode them.  Two of them have no letters, just numbers.  There's one
late model sunroof bus left to go to the shredder Monday, not much to it
but rust, but a complete sunroof unit and some seats.  Have a great
weekend!

Of all the things I've lost, I miss my mind the most.
