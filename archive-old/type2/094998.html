Subject: Re: [T2] Sunroof question

&gt;I have a 1970 Bus with a sunroof.
&gt;
&gt;The sunroof does work off of the crank anymore...the crank is busted.
&gt;

&gt;My question:  where can I get all of the parts (seal, new crank, &gt;cables) 
&gt;in
&gt;one package?

&gt;JC



JC,

One of the reasons I bought my 77 bus was the sunroof. But I found that 
lifting it off and on the bus was almost too much for one person (me). When 
I replaced the seal I removed it and repainted it. I tried other non VW 
sealing materials but finaly caved in and paid large for the VW seal.

The only new parts that seem to be easy to find are the seal and the crank 
handle (Rocky Mountain). Other parts like the mechanical turn 
counter/limiter, the cables, the two rear lifters and other hardware may 
require considerable searching.


Chuck
