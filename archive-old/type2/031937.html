I've heard of this problem, though I haven't experienced it myself.  
&quot;Crud&quot; (scientific name) in the tank (most likely rust flakes) clog up 
filter, shutting off flow of gas.  After a while the flakes settle off 
the filter, at which time you can start up again.

Probably the best cure is removal of the tank and a thourough cleaning.

&gt; start, usually for about 20 to 30 minutes, then it starts right up.  my
&gt; first thought is that their is something in the tank that is getting suck to
&gt; the fuel outlet, then held by pressure from the line and after sitting and
&gt; the pressure releases, it floats away.
