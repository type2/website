Subject: Re: [T2] parts from dealers

Just an example of what is possible. A friend is a parts man at an Audi 
dealer, but is a VW nut as well and has always been and used to work parts 
at a VW dealer. Deeply knowledgeable in the dealer/factory parts world. He 
did a 67 bug absolutely stock in all but a very few details. He was able to 
find eventually new bolts for bolting the body to the pan. They are a very 
special bolt you will not find anywhere but a VW inventory. The washers as 
well are absolutely unique. This was but a few years ago. As it is a stock 
new beetle, at the first show he showed it at he turned down $14,000. It 
wasn't for sale, but he got that offer anyway. Stock ist beste again for 
highest value. He was about $10,000 out of pocket on the project and at 
least that much worth of time finding all the parts and actually doing all 
the work. It is black on black, stunning in person but impossible to get a 
good exposure on film without Ansel Adams behind the shutter.

You just wouldn't believe some of the OEM excess inventory he's got. You 
never saw so many little VW do-dad parts in little VW boxes in your life. 
Big boxes full of little VW bags and boxes. We always have a shot with a 
toast when the boxes come out for display and oogling. It is the most 
incredible stash of NOS VW parts I ever saw. He's got more good stuff than 
whole swap meets I've been to.
