Subject: Re: Bad Boot.  Bad, bad boot.

Just the other day I was reading Muir's take on axle boots. If I recall
correctly, he sez to install them seam up. I'm not saying that he is right,
I'm just saying that may partially explain why so many people install them
seam up. BTW, my boots are installed seam side down (not by me). Can I
twist them while they are mounted on the axle so the seams are horizontal,
or should I just let sleeping dogs lie? They don't leak _much_ (sometimes I
see a drop forming on the seam, but I rarely see a drop on the ground under
them). Just my 2 cents.

P. S. In reply to numerous requests, I will state that leaded gas can be
purchased at the intersection of I-15 and Miramar Road in San Diego, CA at
the &quot;no-frills&quot; gas station. Its cost is the same as 87 unleaded.

If there's a pair of boots in your future, a word to the wise:  The seam goes
horizontal.  About half the split-boots I see are installed with the seam up,
apparently on the assumption they will leak less.  And maybe they will, but
the seam is supposed to be on the neutral axis, where the flexure of the boot
is least.  The only torn urethane boots I've seen, the seam was on the top.
