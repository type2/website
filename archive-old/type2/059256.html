Adam,

I think what they are talking about is a blower fan that sits on the top 
of the engine compartment.  It has two tubes on either side that run to 
the top of the heat exchangers.  The blower sucks air from the engine 
compartment and blows it through the heat exchangers all the way to the 
front of the bus.

When I bought my '79 camper, the blower was not in there, so I bought a 
used one and tubes.  The amount of heat before was nil, but now there is 
what I would call a slight draft of warm air at idle, and a gentle blowing at 
speed.  Nothing close to the amount of heat from a water-cooled car, however.

Alternatives/modifications include putting in-line fans at the middle and 
front of the ducting (JC Whitney sells these kits for Beetles, but 
they could be modified to suit a bus).  Also I have heard a marine bilge fan 
is better at forcing the hot air to the front of the bus than the 
standard VW fan.

Another alternative is a gas heater.  I have one but I rarely use it.
