Greetings...

I'm curious if anyone has a copy or knows where I can find some information
on oil performance over a range of temps and where certain types of oils
start to break down..

The Oil FAQ that was posted a while back rates several brands and types of
oil, but doesn't really talk about oil performance at various
temperatures....

Any thoughts or ideas?

Tom
