Howdy all:
Haven't yet got around to writing up my Wisconsin to Florida trip, basically
because I'm still trying to figure out what the hell went wrong between just
south of Douglas, GA. One bit of bad news: three cylinders running at 110
psi, one at 75. Bad, bad, bad. I don't think the rings ever sealed correctly
in this engine as I was screwing around with it endlessly when I first tried
to fire it. Out and apart it comes again.

Low compression in one cylinder, however, would not cause the oil pressure
to shoot up and the engine to die. So I'm still stumped.

On to the purpose of this post. I wanted to put in a plug for Charlie Ford.
I spent a day with him canoeing the Ocmulgee river, and enjoyed it
thorougly. Very scenic, quiet and meandering. Charlie found some kind of
petrified bone on the sand bank (did you ever get it ID'd?) A fine, quiet
ride. I loved the sound of the wind in those southern pine trees, and the
old swing train bridge was from another era.

The day after paddling with Charlie I got a good, early start, and broke
down 50 miles from Hazlehurst on Highway 441. There ain't much in the way of
people out in those parts, and I refuse to own a cell phone, so I took to my
heels. Flagged down a kind gentlemen on his way to church who turned around
and drove me back to his house to let me use the phone, even though it made
him late for services. I'm sure the lord understood.

I called Charlie who gathered his friend Ken and came out to get me. After
lunch at the Waffle House back in Douglas, we managed to find a U-Haul place
that was open on Sunday. I rented a truck and the three of us went back and
hooked up the bus to the truck. I was off (as it turns out not too far
before trouble struck again but that's another story) thanks to the kind
help of an AIRS founding member.

It's a big damn world out there and one can feel pretty small tooling
through it in a VW. That's why AIRS is such a beautiful thing.

Thanks Charlie, Happy paddling and good luck with the biz
Bob W.
