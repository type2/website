Hi Volks,
   I'm making new curtains for our 71 westy and am wondering about the one 
one for the sliding door.  I have the track with the plastic sliders still 
installed, but need to know about the curtain itself.  Is it one piece that 
gets strapped forward ,next to the sink vent pipe, while driving?  Or is 
there some other arraignment?
   Thanks in advance for the help.
