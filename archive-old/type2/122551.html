&gt; I would really appreciated information about this air cooled VW head

&gt; I am real sure that those are the numbers but the last number/letter may be
&gt; numeral eight

Tom Wilson does not list any heads starting with 029 and this is the only
data I have.  Are you certain the 3rd digit is a 9?  If it was a 1, it would
be a '79 head with the square exhaust ports or a Vanagon head.  If the 2nd
digit was a 3, it could be off a 914.

The last one will be a letter, not a number.
