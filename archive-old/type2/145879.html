Subject: Re: [T2] Koni availability (last last last chance)

NEWS FLASH !!
I just talked to Tim at Classic Garage and he told me he has ONE COMPLETE SET 
left of Koni shocks in stock.  I ordered a set of the fronts and when he was 
filling my order he found some others that were not in the computer.I bought 
one set, and he said he has one more left.  Better hurry while supplies last!!!
