Subject: RE: [T2] It is Friday where I am

I would like to add a couple things to this post but I totally agree with
you David being a part of this family is pretty amazing it is not something
that can be explained either, i guess vws just attract the cool volks. First
of all David that is pretty impressive 3 yrs w/o drivin your bus, I must say
i prolly wouldn't have made it that far if not for drivin my bus b/c just
driving it and seein the smiles on ppls faces when they see the funny shaped
white toaster comin towards them proudly bearing the license plate  &quot;PHAT
VW&quot;, and all the waves i get from motorists air cooled or not. Keep workin
David you think you love your bus now .......just wait :)

Secondly I would like to send a special thankyou to a specific list member
David Schwarze [sde_at_home_dot_com]. The reason for this is recently I had been
lookin for a digital thermometer like the ones discussed in recent threads
on the list. I had absolutely no luck at all finding one in my city (230,000
ppl so not a small city) Then David posted about seein one at costco so i
raced to grab one only to find out that costco in canada doesn't sell the
same stuff as the U.S. So half expecting to be turned down I emailed David
Schwarze and asked him if he would mind picking one up for me and shipping
it to me, well this morning i recieved a package from texas and the
thermometer was exactly what i had been looking for.

So in closing David thank you VERY much for your time spent running around
helping me out. People like you are one of the reasons being a type 2 owner
is so enjoyable.

Subject: [T2] It is Friday where I am


Hello List

Well friday has finially come where I live on the East
coast. It is 1:11 in the morning. I am going to get
mushy and alittle weird on y'all for a second, but I
want to say it. This is an definitely a Friday only
topic.Here it goes.

I am so proud to be a part of such a diverse and
friendly group of people. I know that every group has
it disagreements and this group is no exception, but
the bond that air cooled VW owners have is special and
unique. How many other groups of car owners have a
list of people settup that are willing to drive miles
out of their way, in the middle of the night to help
out a fellow member in need? What other group has some
members that will take the risk of letting a complete
stranger camp out in their yard and join them for
breakfast in the morning all because they both
appreciate the same car and the life that goes along
with it? VW owners are the only ones that come to my
mind.

Another thing about these VW owners is they are made
up of such a dirverse group of people. This group is
made up of people from all over the world with
different backgrounds and lifestyles. You will not
find many other cars that have such an international
appeal and charm.

I guess what I am trying to say is if you ever find
your self frusterated, depressed, angry, or
disappointed with your bus,Vanagon,single or double
cabs,ect..., stop and take a moment to think about the
good times you have had and the feeling of
accomplishment and joy that you have had because of
your vehicle. That is what keeps me going. I have had
my bus for 3 years. I have never driven it on the
road, seen it in new paint or enjoyed the feel of new
uphulstery but I keep working on it, and If I enjoy
driving  it half as much as I have enjoyed working on
it, than I think it will have all been worth it. I
want to thank everyone on the type 2 list for all of
the things that I have learned from you!! I would have
given up on my bus long ago if it hadn't been for this
list. Because of you, one day my bus will live again.
Thanks for all of you that have read this far! (sorry
for the length of it.) I wish all of you good luck
with your VWs!!!

Have a great day!!!
and thanks for bearing with me!
