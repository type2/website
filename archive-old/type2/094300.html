Subject: re: Hooking up brake servo w/ Dual Webers

&gt; I have a '72 Westy and I recently upgraded the carbs
&gt; from stock to a set of Weber 40 IDFs.  After hooking
&gt; everything up, I noticed that there wasn't any way to
&gt; connect the brake servo vacuum hoses.  Oddly, I've never
&gt; heard this problem come up before.  But now that I'm
&gt; faced with it, I'm stumped.
&gt; Am I looking at having to drill and tap my new manifolds
&gt; for the new hookup?  If so, I'd like to know the proper
&gt; placing of it on this new style manifold.

I recently added dual 44 IDFs to my 2.0 L and had to drill and tap a port
for the brakes.  It made a huge difference unless you really want to get a
good leg workout!  :-)
