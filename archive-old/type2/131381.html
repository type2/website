Subject: Strange thoughts when bored at work...

So I've been sitting here since 6am. It's now noon. Taken like 8 calls all 
day so far. Started off thinking about working on the bus tomorrow, but my 
thoughts started skating off in really odd directions (nothing I'd ever 
really try, but piqued my curiousity):

Assuming it could be perfectly sealed, how well would keeping the cylinders 
and heads in a waterflow work?

I'm imagining a cylindrical tank that seals against the engine case and 
keeps the cylinders and heads submerged in coolant. The water is pumped to a 
radiator either mounted up front or in the air intakes of my 73. I know I'd 
then have to have a cold air intake forward of the engine to feed the carbs. 
But the cooling tin can all be removed. I'd have to somehow vent the air 
from the &quot;Mickey's Ears&quot; out... Possibly by louvering the engine hatch.

Seems to me it would be more efficient at cooling than air. Of course, the 
gaskets would have to be absolutely PERFECT to keep the water out, and an 
anti-corrosion coolant mixture must also be perfect to keep the thin steel 
cylinders from rusting.

Aside from the near-impossible task of sealing the tanks against the engine 
case, I'm thinking this would actually work...

Man, I come up with wierd stuff when I'm bored. I'd rather be working on the 
bus. :(
