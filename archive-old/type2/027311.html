Hello All:
Well, at long last the bugs are worked out but one for Lilli-Marlene.
She runs well, and the new clutch makes driving a dream! The last hurdle is 
the Air Intake Sensor which is in need of replacement. If anyone has one out 
there for sale let me know. I'll gladly pay shipping if the part is 
certified as working (i.e.&quot;good&quot;)
Howard
