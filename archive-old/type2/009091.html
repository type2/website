&gt; First the seal is in 3 parts. Two of the seals are the same length
and are
&gt; split. The other is shorter and without the split. I took a look at
what is
&gt; left the seal(s) that are in situ (man they are shot) and It appears
that
&gt; one of the long ones goes around the rear tin(front is front of bus
) and
&gt; the other goes around the front tin. Where does the short piece go? 

It goes across the front (FIF) of the engine bay.  The engine has to
be out to replace it unless you employ black magic.

The other one goes around the sides and back of the engine.  The split
is placed above and below the engine tin,  You will get wrinkles in
the seal at the left and right rear corners.  I take a razor blade and
slit the rubber at this location to get it to lay down properly and
minimize air leaks.
