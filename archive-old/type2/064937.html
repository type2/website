Subject: Re: Warming it up

&gt; 
&gt; John Muir was convinced that the installation of an automatic choke
&gt; was a Volkswagen plot to make your engine wear out sooner so they
&gt; could sell you a new one. Muir was also a great believer in warming up
&gt; your VW engine before driving off claiming that it cut engine wear by at
&gt; least a third. Well, folks, I've just come across another fiendish
&gt; Volkswagen plot to make engines wear out before their time. From my 1971
&gt; KG Owner's Manual:
&gt; 
&gt;       &quot;As soon as the engine starts, release the ignition key
&gt;        so that the starter is switched off. Do not try to warm
&gt;        the engine up by letting it idle with the vehicle
&gt;        stationary - drive off immediately. Do not race the
&gt;        engine while it is cold....&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; ... after all, who're ya gonna believe - John Muir or Volkswagenwerk
&gt; Aktiengesellschaft?
&gt; 
My '78 bus manual says the same thing about warming it up not being
necessary, it justs wastes gas (I swear it says that).  Sometimes, you
don't have much of a choice if you have to wait for the windshield to
defrost somewhat.  Moderate driving really will warm it up faster than
sitting (I know, my oil temp gauge told me).

John Muir mostly knew what he was talking about, but somehow I think the
automatic choke isn't all that bad.  I'd believe Volkswagen, those
engineers knew what they were talking about.
