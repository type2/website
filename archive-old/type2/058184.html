Harmon Seaver asked me:

&lt;&lt;      So if I decided to get another nose cone for 
my '73 002 tranny to  fix my shifting problems, I 
could stick in the ring and pinion from a  dead 090 
I've got and get the higher gear ratios with little 
problem?  And I could use the bellhousing as well, 
giving me back the ability to  use non-automatic 
starters too.  &gt;&gt;

Yes, all 1969-1983 AIRCOOLED transaxle cases
can be interchanged.  (lets not forget the Diesel
Vanagon either!)  Take a look at the Diesel Van's
gearbox.  Its a 002 case with a 091 bellhousing,
intermediate housing (gear carrier housing) and
nose cone.  The 091's input shaft is longer so make
sure that you use a 091 bellhousing.  Also, if you
are using a 215 or 228mm flywheel then you'll need
the 091 bellhousing.  And also the 091 bellhousings
require the 091 starter.  The later aircooled 091 ring 
and pinion sets will work in a 002 case but you must
use the 091 gear carrier housing from a '76-'79 Bus.
Remember the '80-'83 091s are a nosecone sideshift
and take a different intermediate housing than the
earlier true nosecone shift 091s and 002s.
