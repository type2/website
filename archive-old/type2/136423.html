Subject: Portland Oregon Area T2 Clubs?

Ques of Portland Oregon T2 &amp; VB list members.  I'm not
a member of any local T2 club.  I am aware of several,
but don't know which to visit or join.  Webfoot
feedback requested.  Columbia Gorge?  Eugene? 
Kdfwagen in Salem?  Willmette Valley Neato/Limbo
Corvallis?  Any more local?
   
[By-the-way, this T2 List membership is meaty in
content.  What a help.  Have learned more in the last
1.5 months than in the prior 4.5 years of Bus
ownership!  For instance, I've learned that my
mechanic frequently makes the wrong repair
recommendations.]
