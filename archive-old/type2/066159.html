Subject: Re: cv's and circlips 

David Goldberg responded to Randolph Shaner:
Go to your local FALPS, and get some Circlip pliers.  Shouldn't
run you more than 10 clams.  The 2 screwdriver method described in the
Idiot book, as at best a pain in the ass.

So I wrote:
You know, I bought a pair or circlip pliers for about $10 from Chief Auto Parts, 
a local pretty weak FLAPS chain. The pliers have never worked that well,
although they are DEFINITELY better than 2 screwdrivers. I don't quite know what
they lack, but the $%&amp;_at_!! clips very often slip off the tool when I've about 
halfway lifted them off. For your own safety ane peace of mind, spend a little
more and get yourself a high quality pair that actually does the job.

And be SURE to wear eye protection whenever dealing with circlips. I've had those
things jump off in every possible direction at very high speed. They sting
when they hit naked flesh. I hate to think of what they'd do to an eyeball...

Drive safely,
Surfer Bob
