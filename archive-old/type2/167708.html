&gt; This happened to me too. I live in Wilmington, NC.
&gt; Last year, My girlfriend and I decided to go on a week
&gt; long trip from Wilmington to Linville Falls, NC and to
&gt; Grandfather Mountain in my 1968 bus. I could write a
&gt; book about that one trip. I broke down about 10 times
&gt; through out this maiden voyage.

&gt; times. That's whats great about owning an old VW. You
&gt; can fix just about anything on the side of the road!


bus survived, what about relationship with girlfriend????
