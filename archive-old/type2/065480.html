Subject: Jack stands

&gt;I don't even trust jack stands.  Then again I have a gravel driveway 
&gt;as a work space, and getting those things properly seated in the 
&gt;gravel is almost impossible.  I leave the floor jack in position, use jack 
&gt;stands and add some hefty wood pieces under there also.  Thinking 
&gt;about building a wooden elevated ramp to raise the entire vehicle 
&gt;about 8&quot;.  (two 2x6's vertical under a 2x8, full length of vehicle)

I just drive two wheels up on the curb. My street has such a berm
in the middle that it makes the bus level. Plus, the bus is high
enough to squirm under there without getting it high up. My biggest
problem is finding a jack that will lift high enough to reach
the edge of the bus, or the tortion tubes, and still have enough
lift to get it up high. The stupid jack I have has the lift,
but runs out of jack oil, maing me add more to get it up that
high, and then the oil runs out when it comes back down. Cheapo!
