Subject: Re: [T2] oil froth / question

  I was thinking maybe it picked up some
moisture in the air
through the airbox and simply pushed it up to the top or something.
It's about 1 degree
celcius outside (driving it in the nice fresh air) and everything is
good.

I hate to do it...but, what type of oil are you using, and is your 
thermostat installed and intact?
I have only had one brand of oil 'foam' on me, and it did so regardless of 
temps.

Eron
