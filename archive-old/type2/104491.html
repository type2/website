Subject: Re: [T2] Catch-22 / Can't open Slider

&gt; &lt;snicker&gt;
&gt; This will work, but it will be messy, and it may release fluorocarbons
&gt; into the environment. Follow these instructions at your own risk.
&gt; &lt;/snicker&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Puncture the can with a sharp stick. Once the contents are no longer
&gt; under pressure the soft metal of the can will be a lot easier to
&gt; compress. Now use a blunt stick to smash the can flat until the
&gt; diameter is reduced enough to get the door open.

Why not unbolt the fridge / sink and move it out of the way?
