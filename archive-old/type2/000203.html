Importance: Normal

I bought a bus with a blown engine, so I have decided to build a stock
engine (1600) with the following modifications to an AH case (first line
bore)
1.Counter-weighted crank
2.Pistons, rods, crank,flywheel and clutch assembly balanced.
3.Stock heads, match-ported and polished runners,and a three-angle valve
job.
4.Extractor exhaust (S&amp;S header)
5.Stock dizzy (vacuum) and carb (undecided)
6.Full-flow oil filter system

I am soliciting opinions, criticisms, suggestions,etc. Undecided as to make
of oil pump and whether to use swivel feet rocker arms. I already received a
suggestion to use a &quot;new&quot; beetlemex engine but I was already committed to
the rebuild. As always, any information will be greatly appreciated. TBear
