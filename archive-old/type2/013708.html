I tried to get a job as a wrecker driver but was rejected because I
didn't have the required two fellony convictions.
The guy put a lot of weight on your heater boxes and your cylinders are
probably leaking. Thats if he pulled it from the rear.
If the guy has a roll on/off carrier then you've probably just got a
short.
The price isn't bad considering the new parts required.
But it sounds like a long term case of neglect that reached critical
mass.

 and told me what he was doing and what needed to be done:
 
 new front rotors (new)
 new calipers     (new)
 rear drums       (used)
 rear back plates (used)
 and about 5 hours of labour at $35 / hour
 
 total in the ballpark of $600
 that was somewhat expected....
 
 but...
 he also told me that the engine was only running on 2 cyls (1 &amp; 
 2)...
