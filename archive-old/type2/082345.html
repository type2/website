Subject: heater fuel pump

I have recently acquired a bn4 heater but the fuel pump doesn't sound like it 
runs when I connect a battery source, also I would like to bench test this 
before installing it. What kind of fuel pump can I get for it, I looked at 
the aftermarket electrics at napa for about 20 bucks they said they are low 
pressure. thanks and  keep vdubbing
