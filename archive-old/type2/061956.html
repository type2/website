On the other hand, in Phoenix (September through Mother's Day) we assume
that you are Canadian if you drive ten miles (km) per hour slower than the
posted speed limits and make sudden right hand turns from the left most lane
with no signal. Most folks in Phoenix are guilty of five to ten MPH over the
posted &quot;to make up for the lack of freeways.&quot; It's that hair on fire thing
again. As far as accents, mispronunciations, and noncomprehension are
concerned, lets check to see how many names of Arizona locations are
butchered. Yuma, Ajo, Gila Bend, Agua Fria, Casa Grande, Tucson, and
especially No Parking.
Phoenicians (known as 'Zonies) make up for it by haunting San Diego all
Summer. It's the same thing but different. (un-huh, right)

Actually, the Canadian folks that I have encountered have (most) always been
friendly and polite. In light of how hot it is in AZ right now I would love
to be in Banff.
