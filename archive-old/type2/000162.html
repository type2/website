&gt;have done everything right, plus if it were just PR tube leaks, that would

&gt;a bit.  You ain't gonna like what I am gonna say... fortunately it is just
&gt;a personal theory and I am not expert.  Altho it mostly applies to older
&gt;engines, I will state it here because it may be applicable (did you put on
&gt;new heads? where did the new heads come from?  did they get new guides?)

I only thought the rear main seal was leaking and replaced it in desperation 
trying to fix the leaks. I think the fan was sucking all the oil from the 
leaking pushrod tubes making the rear seal appear to be leaking.

I sent my uncracked original heads to Mark Stephens and waited 10 weeks for 
the rebuild and turnaround since they looked to be in great shape. So I 
should have new seats, guides, valves--the works. The heads looked great when 
I unpacked them. I agree I have high case pressure and have tried to vent the 
engine as much as possible.

I first ran the new engine with the oil breather plumbed to the carb. Then I 
siamased a second line from the fitting on the left rear corner of the engine 
that I think goes to the charcoal filter thinking it also should be vented. 
The engine seemed to leak worse with the new line vented. I even checked the 
oil pressure relief valve thinking is was upside down or something (sorry I 
already wrote that). It wasn't.

I must be missing something, or is this a phenomeon that will cure itself 
with run-in? The engine already has about 600 miles on it. I am skeptical 
that it will. All the help is certainly appreciated. Somebody out there must 
have the answer.
