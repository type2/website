Kevin,

Just another quick note, have you ever contacted Tom Briolette of NEATO.  He
has a business where he rents out later model VW campers to the public.
He's always asking me to find him some nice campers for his business.  You
might try him in New Mexico at: 505-268-2220.

Regarding sending pictures... Would I first scan the picture, save as a JPEG
or other file and then attach it to Eurdora email?

Regards,
