Subject: Re: [T2] hard to get clean in hard water..

I've found that with hard water deposits that a good fine cut cleaner first
works the best before waxing. I always use Maguires fine cut or medium cut
depending on how heavy the oxidation or scratches etc. are. Then apply a
thin coat of Maguires carnuba #26 wax to finish off. It will leave a very
smooth glassy finish.

Subject: [T2] hard to get clean in hard water..


&gt; I finally gave my bus a much needed wash tonight. No wonder she seems
slow,
&gt; she's got an extra 40 lbs. of hard water deposits on her!!  Can anyone
&gt; recommend a god wax or polish to remove this crap. Elbow grease and Turtle
wax
&gt; didn't cut it. Hopefully whatever is suggested won't cost me an arm and a
&gt; leg...hint hint.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
