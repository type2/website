&gt; You will need to get a mounting  bracket. The bracket is just a sheet metal

can anyone suggest a good source for metric pop-nuts?

i have a 68 westy bed and it requires about 4 of these or so to be mounted
properly to the rear deck over the engine and no hardware stores i have
been to seems to have these... (and if you know what size the westy bed
takes, that would help too...)

peas,

Steve
