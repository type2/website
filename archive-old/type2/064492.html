&gt; Subject: Push rod tube seals.
&gt; 
&gt; The push rod tube seals on my 2litre type4 engine are leaking
&gt; badly and need replacing. I have been informed this is an easy
&gt; job only taking a few hours, ie rocker assembly off, rods out,
&gt; tubes out, new seals, reassemble, reset valve clearances.
&gt; 
&gt; I am new to type4 engines as in the UK the 1600 was standard
&gt; on all baywindows, and thats what I'm use to.  I would be very
&gt; gratefull of any advice, I am sceptical about pulling the tubes
&gt; through the cylinder head.
&gt; 
&gt; It is a 'CJ' series engine (2litre, twin solex, no hydraulic cam
&gt; followers etc), fitted to a 1979 baywindow Viking camper.
&gt; 
&gt; Yours gratefully

Mick,

honestly it is as easy as that.  Only concern is that when you replace 
the pushrod tubes, and seals, make sure, and make sure again, that the 
bores are clean.  The cleaner they are, the less likely they are to leak.

BTW, what carbs are you using (other than the just the name Solex) on 
your engine. The PO removed my fuel injection, and the carb that I am 
running is about worn out.  I would like to go to a dual carb setup, 
rather than a single, but I do not know what carbs will be sufficient, 
without weeks of test, and tweak, test and tweak.  I have been fiddling 
with my single since October, and I still cannot get it just right, if 
you know what I mean.

Thanks in advance,

David
