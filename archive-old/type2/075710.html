&gt; In my 71 Westy, I had installed a progressive Pinto carb and ran a

&gt; the choke valve.  No problem starting it.

years ago when I had a 71 I would go out to the carb and manually set
it. DON'T touch the accelerator and it would usually stay and start right
up.

of course a little starting fluid probably wouldn't hurt anything either
