Subject: Installation woes -Advice needed!

Hi all,

I am in the final stages of getting my restored Westy back on the road =
in time for some summer fun and it is of course now that the %*=A4/ hits =
the fan- That is if I could install the darn thing....

The situation is this: 1972 euro westy 1600 upright (AS case, original =
replacement from early in it's life) DC generator, upright oil cooler =
(stock installation). Anyway after paint interior seals and all the =
other replacement items, I didn't have enough spare cash to do carry out =
plan 1 (a new turnkey fuel injected 1600), so I decided to just do a =
couple of minor things on the original engine. These were: Replacement =
of the DC generator with an alternator to provide better charging for =
the dual batteries and power my accessories and addition of a Weber =
progressive 2 barrel carb (empi intake).

The problem is that I have clearance problems with the carb and the =
alternator and the fan shroud. When installing the alternator I find =
that it is about 1.5 inches shorter than the generator and that it sits =
a bit higher as well. As for the carb it will just fit in there but with =
the choke solenoid directly against the shroud.=20

I assume I will need to change out the shroud to get this to work but =
I'm not sure what to change to and/or what other complications may be =
included. I would expect a different shroud would also require me to =
move/ relocate the oil cooler???  Advice and any suggestions are very =
welcome.

TIA,

John B.
