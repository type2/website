&gt; For $4,000 you could buy a bus here and then a RHD front beam from the

This is not really a viable option as virtually all our RHD beams are
rotten, even the late ones.  It is very common over here to replace beams
with imported used ones from the U.S. and convert to RHD.  I am doing this
at the moment.
