Hi Nick,

Simple-- You may have a cracked fitting somewhere.



Would you guys say that this performance is generally symptomatic of a va=

leak in the assisted brake system?

I ask because every car i have ever owned (including the bus) has perform=

like this to some degree.  Some - the old toyota tercel - you could sit a=
t a
light and pump the brakes and damn near kill the engine...

TIA,
