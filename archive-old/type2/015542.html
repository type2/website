&gt;I've been using STP brand DOT3 brake fluid.
&gt;
&gt;My local parts source V-DUB Folks in Irving / Dallas TX, sells ATE and
&gt;the current cylinder is an ATE and has the VW symbol with 4 little
&gt;olympic circles overlapped on one side.

Now the question is, are these parts still manufactured in Germany?? I
haven't yet seen anything ATE marked Mexico or Brazil, but I'm holding my
breath. Did these cylinders come in the dark blue ATE box??? If not, you
might be getting rejected parts bought at liquidation for the value of the
steel in recycling. That is rare, but it does happen. If it comes unboxed
or white/brown boxed do look elsewhere for a genuine parts supplier. The
shop next to me has no end of problems with FLAPS parts for US and Asian
cars. He more and more is learning the value of genuine parts in stopping
the time sink of comebacks.

Use nothing but DOT 4 fluid as specified. ATE is good stuff, but ANY DOT 4
fluid, even NAPA, is better than ANY DOT 3 or 5 by any manufacturer.
Castrol LMA DOT 4 is available at most FLAPS and is used in my shop for all
Euro systems. 

&gt;
&gt;When I change to DOT 4, do i need to bleed the entire Brake / Clutch
&gt;system? 

Indeed, the brake fluid should be flushed through the whole system as a
matter of periodic maintenance, not just when you do brake repair from
failure due to lack of maintenance. How do you know the period??? By
INSPECTION. If the fluid has changed beyond yellow to brown, your a bit too
late. Yearly is the rule of thumb, however inspection might show a longer
interval in very arid climes. 

What you may have is recontamination of the new cylinders by the crud in
the fluid reservoir. If the reservoir is filthy it must be cleaned before
progressing. Remove it, put a handfull of BB's or small metal
parts/nuts/screws in it and shake it with water to remove all the crud.
Then do a final cleaning/flushing with alchohol or brake cleaner and blow
dry. Reinstall. Fill/flush/bleed.

Know if inspection shows a contaminated reservoir, the whole system is
contaminated. The new fluid will act as a solvent for the crud throughout
the system, brakes and clutch. Flushing a system that has not been serviced
for many years can sometimes lead to further failures when the new fluid
loosens gum and varnish. More seals can start to leak within a few weeks of
service. Hoses get swollen and blocked. Calipers bind and won't release. 

One of the very first things I look at before proceeding with further
inspection of a vehicle of unknown history is the brake/clutch fluid
reservoir. If it's nasty, I always assume full parts replacement will be
required to ensure safety and reliability for the long term.

At this point it seems to be self bleeding from the topmost part
&gt;of the clutch master cylinder. Fluid comming up through the bubber
&gt;bellows that the actuator rod passes down through.

That's the typical evidence of the seal not sealing. The only thing I can
think of is recontamination of the seals with chunks of yuk from the
reservoir. Further inspection of these failed cylinders could be very
enlightening. Do we have excess wear of seals or surfaces?? Maybe just a
varnish residue problem?? The one year life must be explained by something
unusual as this is not just rare, but unheard of in my experience with
hundreds of ATE systems serviced yearly.
