I am about ot put my engine back in tonite and something occurred to me that I am not sure about.  I have installed many v8s and when stabbing the engine, it is simply a matter of turning the output shaft on the trans by hand to get the teeth to line up on hte input shaft of the trans &amp; clutch disk.  But with the rear engine mount on the bus, it seems that you would be unable to rotate the shaft w/ the axles installed.  Again, on the engines i have installed, if driveshaft were connected, you could always rotate the engine by the crank/balancer/whatever by wrench, but with the vw, doesn't seem to be anything to turn (safely).  Im not sure if this will be a problem, as I ahve not even tried to install it yet and am currently at work unable ot look at the van, but I wanted to doublecheck if there was an easier way than simply rocking the engine/trnasmission until the shaft lines up ((this doesn't sound very appealing as I am on dirt w/ shitty jacks)  any help appreciated 
THnaks
