Ken:
Good advice, but ONE more thing: It seems like a few times I've run into
problems, I've found one or more completely plugged (collapsed?) rubber
brake hoses. These are maybe 20-30 years old, so maybe they don't owe me
anything...(I shoulda bought 4 with the M/C). I think they were
marginally working with brake fluid, but with only air in the M/C they
just won't pass anything.
