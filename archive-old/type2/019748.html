I don't know if you can do this, but can you put one edge of the grommet
on the metal, and then use a screwdriver to push the rest of the grommet
on?  I had to do some major prying to get that AFM grommet out..

&gt; Darn it, how do you get the darn thing through the hole?
&gt; 
&gt; Right, so I've purchased a new metal fuel line to replace the one
&gt; that goes from the engine compartment through the firewall to the fuel
&gt; tank, and I've purchased a new rubber bushing/gasket (part 111-189a) that goes
&gt; around the fuel line where it goes through the firewall, to keep the tin
&gt; from cutting through the metal line.  Unfortunately, I can't get the bushing
&gt; through the hole in the firewall!  I've greased it up, tugged on it, pushed
&gt; on it, everything I can think of and still it won't go through.
&gt; 
&gt; I've noticed that http://www.type2_dot_com/library/fuel/fireprev.htm
&gt; mentions just using tubing wrapped around the metal line as opposed
&gt; to the bushing -- is this a sensible thing to do given that I've tried
&gt; about all I could to get the bushing through that hole and failed?
&gt; Is an alternative to this to just put 2-3&quot; of the cloth-braided fuel
&gt; line around the metal line where it passes through, wrapped in duct
&gt; tape to make it a snug fit, and with a clamp on either side of the
&gt; firewall to keep it from moving or pulling through either way?  It
&gt; sounds like a hack, and I'm concerned that the metal clamps against the
&gt; tin might vibrate a bit, but i can't see that having any real adverse
&gt; effects.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, just looking for methodology or alternatives.  I guess whatever
&gt; I do, I'll keep a good eye on the line there, I'd just love to use
&gt; someone else's hard work and experience instead of beating my head
&gt; against the wall and/or losing my lovely bus to a hasty decision to use
&gt; an unsafe fuel-line method.
&gt; 
&gt; many thanks,
&gt;         t
