Subject: Casper has new Tin

Today .........
I received a right rear corner section from Bryan Mitchell of North 
Carolina today.
It came off of Bryan's bus that got wrecked last year.

The tin I received from Bryan is perfect.
Cut just right.
All rust free.
Shipped nicely.
Looks to me like a piece of cake to cut the smooshed piece out and weld the 
new piece in.

As I walked past Casper to take the package back to my work area I could 
feel Casper shiver with delight.
I just told him to be patient.
Casper said it was a good day to be patched.

Then Casper saw the piece to be installed was red.

I told him to chill out.
I would take care of that.

The big guy is really excited,
and I must admit I am just as excited.

Thanks Bryan.
Thanks List.
