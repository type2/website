Subject: Strange sound deadening material.

I went to the local police auction this week and found a sweet 71 camper
there. I bought it for $500.00! It was confiscated from a DUI and never
claimed. It has TX tags and is very rust free. My question is about the
strange sound deadening material in the pop-top. They stuck bags and bags of
the stuff all along the edges of the roof to deaden sound and seal up the air
leaks. It works just fine, but makes lifting the pop top kinda heavy, (they
used a LOT of tape). Would anything else be better?



Funny thing is I have had a couple of calls from a guy trying to buy the bus,
and I have not even advertised it yet! The guy offered me $5000.00! I guess
rust free campers are rare around here, and news travels fast!



Oh well, I thought I would share. The bus is great and I have a very happy
feeling driving it. Talk about good Karma, I seem energized in some way when I
drive it. I went to the Wal-Mart three times today just to shop, and I never
shop. The last time the greeters said &quot;you again?&quot;. Very cute, those guys are
so nice.
