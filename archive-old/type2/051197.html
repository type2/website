Safelite, I'll still make the plug, installed under $100.  Nice tinted glass,
well done, fit in new WCM rubber like a champ.  $130 total with my rubber.
I did the install mostly myself while the guy watched as I've pulled at least
7-8 bay windshields and he had never done one.  Safelite dealers are
most everywhere I think.

Now I'll also note Chris (ncbus) had loads of trouble with one from them
so YMMV big on this.  This may have been due in part or a lot to the
installer.  Funny as it seems installing rubber like this is getting to be
a real thing of the past, and the bay window bus is about as bad a seal
and glass as you can possibly try to do.  To not leak you got to get it
perfectly centered with the perfect amount of  rubber bunched up in
the corners.  The WCM style seal doesn't do that great a job at this, real
VW seals had formed corners, maybe Ron's south america VW seals
do now, I don't know.

This all bears out another fact, unless you got real big (ahem) or incredible
luck you CAN NOT remove a bay windshield to preserve the rubber.
I've come damn close, Dolan muttered something about having done
it.  But, rubber $30, windshield at LEAST $100, cut the seal volks,
all the way round, all the way back till you see the edge of the glass
all the way round.  Then pound real gently.
