I picked up my first type 2 on Sunday, a 1978 1600cc Holdsworth (uk)
conversion with twin sliding doors, its very solid but the cab doors will
need skining and it'll need a respray before next winter. I have two
questions, firstly I need to replace the engine bay seal, I would presume
this is easy enough to do but not sure, any pointers? Secondly my pop top is
sagging slightly in the middle and is gathering water, is there anything I
can do about this or will I just have to make sure the skylight seal is
extra waterproof? thats all for now, thanks for any help,
