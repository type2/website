 positive battery cable.  Could a loose connection be the cause of this?  Let
 me know what you think.  I always appreciate the help I get from the list.
 There is NO WAY I could keep my baby running without the list.  I will stop

It definitely could be a poor connection.  I always recommend that for a 
first place to check any time there is a starter problem.  When a battery 
first starts to crank it draws a whole bunch of current, so a very small 
resistance can cause a huge voltage drop and the starting motor won't go.

Good luck.
