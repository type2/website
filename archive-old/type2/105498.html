&gt; &gt; yeah but you can't get a 4X8 sheet of plywood in the back with the tire

&gt; 
&gt; Just remove the spare from the tire well and let it sit flat on the floor.
&gt; Not a big deal, and it helps you get the plywood into the bus (that is a
&gt; really tight fit!)

yup REAL tight fit

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; the real reason my tire is on the front!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; besides I &quot;Like&quot; it there kinda neat looking IMO, first option I did to my
&gt; &gt; bus when I got it.   (it didn't have the VW emblem either)
&gt; 
&gt; I don't like front tire mounts because I've never seen one that hasn't
&gt; damaged the front of the bus in some way.  There are few pristine front
&gt; ends out there and a front tire mount just about guarantees that someone
&gt; is going to moosh in your front end while parking by braille.

the moosh is under the tire and it is the least of my worries, don't plan
on getting rid of this bus anyway
&gt; 
&gt; BTW, if you carry sheet goods a lot, you can make hooks that slide into
&gt; the jack points.  These hold the sheet goods upright against the side of
&gt; the bus.  Tie-down straps attach to the hooks and extend up to hook over
&gt; the drip rail to secure the load.  Much more convenient than trying to fit
&gt; the sheets inside.
&gt;
hmmmmmm   never seen these, sounds like a slick idea...not sure what kind
of shape my jack points are in either since I never use em.
