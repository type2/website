Looks like I will be joining my wife for a few days in Austin next week.
She has a high mucky muck business conference to attend all week long, 
and I will just tag along, lay by the pool, read a bit, drink lunch, 
whatever.
We arrive August 8, and will probably depart Saturday or Sunday (12th 
or 13th)..... Most likely depart on the 13th.

We are going over in NewBus.
I may pack up an go tubeing one day or to Gruene Hall.
Anyone in that area up for a beer or interested to get together just to 
&quot;hang out&quot;.
My cell # where I can be reached during that time frame is 832-443-5780.

We may take off Friday afternoon and go to Luckenbach, but pretty much 
everything is up to what direction the wind blows.
Let me know,
Bob Perring
