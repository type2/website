Subject: Oil pressure gauge readings...

Good morning Y'all,
Yesterday I completed the install of a VDO oil
pressure gauge in my 71 westy, 1600 DP.  I am just
curious as to what I should consider &quot;normal&quot; PSI
readings on the gauge.  On  my way to work this
morning I got a reading of just over 20 PSI at idle
and then at 55MPH I got a reading of just over 40 PSI.
 Its all backroads to work and it was a cool morning,
so oil temps stayed about 180 degrees with the
previously mentioned pressure readings.
Anyway, what reading is considered &quot;too low&quot; what
reading is considered &quot;too high&quot;.  
Just curious about what I should expect the gauge to say.

Peace, John Baker
