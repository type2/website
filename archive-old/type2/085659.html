&gt; &gt; Kyle,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Welcome. I almost advised you to quit while you are ahead but your 
&gt;comment
&gt; &gt; that you had fixed the horn gave me pause. If you can fix the horn on a 
&gt;VW
&gt; &gt; you show real promise. Smog can be a challenge.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Just as a start you must pass SMOG to register the bus in California.
&gt;
&gt;At what age do they give up on smog? 30 years?

This is what I understand. This does not keep the DMV from sniffing you out 
as a gross polluter as you drive by.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; If your bus hasn't had to meet very strict smog specifications up to now
&gt; &gt; you may have to replace some rather hard to find and expensive parts.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Step 1 is to determine if your bus is 49 State(Fed) model or a 
&gt;California
&gt; &gt; model. The engine door should have the info written inside the lid.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Step 2 get a look at service manual (Robert Bentley is good) and compare
&gt; &gt; your exhaust and fuel injection components to those in the manual.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My last time thu smog with a 1977 bus I did the work. I had to:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1. Replace the Egr Filter $138
&gt; &gt; 2. Replace the Cat Converter $125
&gt; &gt; 3. Replace The Egr Valve (1979 may not have one) $200 (rebuilt)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; 4. Replace the Fuel Filler Restrictor $150 (long story)
&gt;
&gt;I'd like to hear this story.

Here is the story. You can't pass CAL smog with a &quot;tampered&quot; fuel filler 
neck. Now if you or the PO drive away from a pump without removing the fuel 
nozzle the filler restrictor can be torn and fall under the &quot;tampered&quot; 
category. This is a eyeball test. Heck technically they could fine you I 
guess.
The restrictor is to keep you from using leaded gas and poisoning the CAT 
converter ( required for my 77 bus but not required for FED 49 state 77 
models).
My restrictor was torn and only the FED version was available at a 
reasonable price ~$20. I was quoted $150 if they could find one at SMOG HELP 
(1-800-544-4357 Darron I believe was his name).

I put in the FED version 211 201 199 I think the CAL version is 211 201 
199B. Replacing this part CAL or FED is not fun. The smog tech looked into 
my filler and marked me down for a tampered fuel restrictor (FED version).

So here's what I did. I cut the hood off the damaged CAL filler neck, closed 
the torn restrictor hole by tightening a wire tie around it (it looked 
good). I left the opening lip attached to the trimmed and closed restrictor. 
I removed the metal flange from the fuel opening, applied a coat of Vas to 
the trimmed CAL neck and shoved it into the FED neck. I replaced the flange 
(4 screws) and passed smog.

I warned you it was a long story.

Chuck




&gt;
&gt; &gt; 5. Pull and clean the air distribution manifold. (not fun)
&gt; &gt; 6. Fix a wiring problem so the erg light would work
&gt; &gt; 7. New plugs, points
&gt; &gt; 8. Set the C0 level with a exhaust analyzer
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I would guess that you will face a similar fate unless you have a close
&gt; &gt; relative that runs a smog test station.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Good luck
&gt;
