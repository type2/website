Subject: Re: Wiper Motor Gear/Shaft

Ernie (re wiper motor repair)- I also transplanted the gear shaft only from
spare wiper motor when I noticed wire harness plug didn't match.  As per
Bentley, my arms also parked in UP position- you have to align the arm with
the plane of the motor 180 deg. opposite what Bentley said (ie, have arm
END pointing away from motor end, not at it); then they run in the right
direction to allow a park at the bottom- fine tune it by noting where shaft
parks and THEN attach the wiper arm.      MB in NJ
