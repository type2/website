Subject: Re: [T2] Possum Name Sticks and Aux Battery 


Thanks for the help. I'snt there some sort of battery charger in this
system? Is it just that the transformer [T] steps the current down to 12V,
and if so would'nt it be possible to cook (overcharge) the battery?

Looks to me like the red wire goes to the Battery + thence to relay 87
while the white wire goes to Battery - thence to relay 85. What I'd do
is trace the wires back and see if they connect to the timer/switch and
the battery guage respectively.
