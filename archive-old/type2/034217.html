&gt;  and a locking  push-button handle for a cabinet.

Greets -

I have a handle with a push button. It does not include the locking
mechanism on the &quot;other&quot; side of the door/cabinet, though. If this is what
you need, let me know where you want it shipped, and give a few days to
finally get a &quot;round tuit&quot;.
