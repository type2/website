Subject: I get &quot;idiot of the year&quot; award

Yes, I am the biggest idiot. 
Discovered today (as I was installing my remote oil 
cooler) that I had somehow swapped the lines going
to my full flow oil filter. This is why I was getting
oil out of my crank/pulley area and why I was overheating
at freeway speeds (my Berg idot temp light would flicker until I slowed
down to 50mph).

What I want to know is...have I caused any damage by 
having driven the bus for 3,000mi with the oil not
being pumped through the filter and back into the engine?
