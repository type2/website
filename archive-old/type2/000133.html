Subject: alignment needed?
Message-ID: &lt;0.adaf4a6.25454314_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Hello everyone,
  I recently checked my brakes and found that i dod indeed ne new ones soon, 
but also found that i have really bad wear on the inside of my front tires. I 
guess this is bad toe out. It doesnt pull to either side while driving or 
breaking, so i figured that the alignment is fine. 
  I have very little experience working with the front end of my bus other 
than lubrication. I usually find myself laying under the rear. I know that 
Muir speakes of adjustments to make, but is this for alignment, or somethin 
else. Will my local Sears automotive have the computers to check it for me 
and adjust it so, or is this a manual adjustment that i can do in my 
driveway.  I really dont want to let some kid drive my bus, even if its only 
for fifty feet to find that they cant do anything with it.
