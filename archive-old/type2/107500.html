Subject: Re: Steering Box upgrade from early to late Bay Bus

George- I received my new TRW steering box today from CIP.  It looks
beautiful. I called Bus Boys and talked to Walter. He was kind enough to
mike the big through-the-frame shaft on a 70 box and on a new TRW box. The
good news is, the diameter differs by only 10 thou, the 70 shaft is 2.11&quot;,
the TRW is 2.12&quot;. Most likely it will go through the frame, but if not, a
light touch with a Dremel on the hole should ease it through.
I'll be pulling my steering box soon.
I have a late Pitman arm on the way from Busted VW.  I'll have to get an
M24-1.5  nylok nut for the output shaft from a local fastener house.
The new box calls for EP90 gear oil on a card included with it.

&lt;Have you completed this swap?  I was under the impression that the large
hole through the frame on the early bus was too small for the later box.
I hope that I am wrong on this, since the late boxes are so much better.

On the mounting bolts, you do need to add the tubes to prevent the frame
from being crushed, but you also have to make sure that the tubes are
firmly held to the frame metal on both ends, either by being bolted or by
being welded to the frame metal.  You can't just drill a big hole, slide
the tube in, and bolt things up, since the big hole will not properly
transmit the steering box loads to the frame unless the tube is securely
welded to the frame on the big hole end.

I've never seen a late model box wear out, so this might be a attractive
junkyard swap.
