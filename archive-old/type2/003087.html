My 77 (rebuilt like a 78 with hydraulics) has been parked for months. It has
12K since AVP rebuild. Do I need to do anything to the valves or lifters
maintenance-wise, or just start her up and wait for them to quiet down as
usual.  New gas, oil, filters, plugs, battery, etc and I'd like to put a
fire in the beast. Pmail if you can advise as I'm in digest mode.  Thanks.
BCN ya!  Jay
