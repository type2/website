Message-ID: &lt;7i30qa$u8sj_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

While I've got the engine out of my 72 type2, I decided to install an oil pressure sender so I can easily add the guage when I get more money.  My problem is, with the type4 engine, the sender and the distributer hit each other.  What is the best way to seperate the two?  Thanks for any comments or suggestions.
