Subject: Re: EFI sputtering

I had the exact same problem with my 76 bus with EFI when I bought it in 88. 
Only, it wouldn't sputter, it would just die in mid-second. And always in the 
most inconvenient places. I happpened to mention it to an elderly gent who 
asked me about my bus, [after my mechanic told me he didn' t have a clue] and 
he said, &quot;it's the box on your firewall with all the wires comin' out of it.&quot; 
I asked him if he'd owned a bus, and he said, no he never had. A bug? No. 
Then how do you know? He said, &quot;I don't know how I know, I just know.&quot;  So, I 
looked , and sure enough there was a little metal box on the firewall with a 
multiwire harness hanging on it, and the parts guys at the local vw dealer 
said it was the controller for the injectors. I bought a new one,[$80.00 in 
88-no idea now] and threw it into the glovebox, cause they said once used, no 
returns. Ouch. Few days later, on the interstate, blam, stopped dead again, 
and I said, what the hey- I put the new box in, threw the old one in the 
glovebox, and IT NEVER PULLED THAT STOPPING STUNT AGAIN. NEVER. NOT ONCE. Go 
figure. Never saw the old guy to thank him either. But I aint forgot him. 
So maybe it's the box on your firewall with all the wires coming out of it.
