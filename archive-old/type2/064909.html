Subject: re: Audi 5 cyl to 68 &amp; newer TII Trannies

I have converted my TII to water cooled and am very pleased with the
results.  My 64 Double Cab is driven 300-400 miles a week (a fair share on
mountain roads).  I have 18,000 miles on the retrofit.

The Subaru 4 cyl is an excellant choice.  Same shape as a VW (opposed),
smaller in all dimensions, more horses, reliability.  The engines are easy
to find &amp; cheap.  I now have 4, 2 good runners and 2 for parts.  Top dollar
paid was $50.  No cutting is required on vehicle, and a radiator will fit
back there with the door closed.

Retrofit involves modifying the Subaru bell housing (which unbolts from
engine)(I will be glad to provide anyone with the actual procedure), and
modifying a VW flywheel by adding the Subaru 8 bolt pattern and opening up
Center hole a bit.  Some rigging and plumbing of the radiator.  I started
with a VW generator mounted on a curved bracket, but have since switched to
an alternator.  Electronic ignition is built on to the coil or in the
distributor.

By using this method of conversion, a VW engine can be re-installed in
minutes if needed.

I am currently building a 1800cc Turbo, Efi (115 horses), which will free up
my current engine for use in my 63 bug.
