Subject: FW: [T2] Burning rubber smell?

Did the smell appear at the same time as the adjustment? If so maybe try
backing it off a little bit and see if that makes the difference.
My 2 cents,

Subject: [T2] Burning rubber smell?

Let me describe the situation and get some feedback. I've driven my Westy
twice now where I smell what smells like burning rubber. No idiot lights
come
on, it runs great, there's just this smell. Here's what I'm wondering. I'm a
newbie. Took my bus to a guy in our VW Club who is supposedly very
knowledgeable who taught me how to adjust my valves. When we finished he
checked my generator belt and said &quot;it's a little loose. Let me show you how
to tighten it&quot;. I knew how to do this, but thought I'd
observe anyway. I'd never moved the shims, so this was good practice. I felt
that there was only a 1/2 inch play beforehand however, and when he was
finished I thought if a 1/2 inch is what we need, then this is too tight,
but
this guy is light years ahead of me, so what do I know? Do you think the
belt
is too tight and this is what I'm smelling? If so, should I loosen it? Can
this hurt anything? My gut feeling is that it won't hurt anything, but it
might wear the belt out at a quicker rate, but then again, I'm a
&quot;non-mechanically inclined newbie&quot;
