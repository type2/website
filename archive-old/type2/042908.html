Subject: Re: Still runnin way hot!

&gt;at top right side of engine just in front of the cooling blower there
&gt;should be a rod with a little lever on it. move that lever if it springs
&gt;back then your probably in full open position.  we are talking a rod that
&gt;runs into the black tin and runs most of the width of the engine, about
&gt;1/4 inch. the lever is actually the clamp for the cable from the
&gt;thermostat and is maybe an inch long.

Ok I located the rod, I can rotate it but it's real sluggish and does not 
spring either way. Which is the open position? It's currently pulled back, 
that's the way I found it.

Thanks!
Marvin
