&gt; Hi one and all,
&gt; Today I got a message on my machine from a damsel in distress.  She lives
in
&gt; or near San Diego, is a single mom, a student, and her '73 is broke down.
&gt; She is looking for someone to help her out.  Please P-mail me and I can
give
&gt; you her phone number.  She sounds pretty desperate, I hope someone down
there
&gt; can help her.
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Gary Morgan (CA)
&gt;
&gt; PS can someone forward this to the 68-up list?
