Subject: RE: [T2] cleaning gasoline tank

I am assuming of course that in this extensive process of removing the tank,
having it cleaned, putting entirely new fuel lines throughout the complete
fuel system, and new filters, that the person should also replace the fuel
pump?  wouldn't that have varnish in it as well?  And what of the vapor
reclamation system?  could there be fouling in there as well?  I understand
that doing it all would qualify as thorough, but have the folks that have
done this process also had to replace their pumps and vapor reclamation due
to the varnish issue?

Curious in Oregon,
