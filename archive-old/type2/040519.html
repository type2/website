Subject: Exhaust gasket trouble

Goldie, my '71 Westy with 1600 DP and extractor exhaust is having exhaust
gasket problems- she keeps blowing them out. Have replaced 2 header to
muffler gaskets in as many days and now find the heat exchanger gaskets to
be gone also. The archives suggest installing a flange to permanently
correct the problem; however, I can't do that now. Does anyone have any tip,
tricks, or unique solutions to solve this problem?  Will high temp gasket
sealer help? As always, any help or direction will be GREATLY appreciated.
TIA TBear
