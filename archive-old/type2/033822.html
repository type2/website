Whaaa hey it was 80 today and this is winter in miami

&gt; &gt; Sounds like the opinion of someone who doesn't have to deal with 100+
&gt; &gt; degree temperatures all sumer long.  :)
&gt; 
&gt; far from it, im from chicago it gets in the 80's in the summer, oh sure
&gt; some days it hits 100+ but i perfir to ride with the window's open.

This is the season when we remember that the Three Wise Men brought the
magic pumpkin to the Feral Chocolate Bunny so there would be Peace On
Earth and six more weeks of winter.
