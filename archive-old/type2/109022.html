&gt; for 70 dollars you can get a Bently dealer manual....It's got everything
you'll need and it will last a lifetime...

I found some on-line owner's manual scans that helped a bit, but I'm
probably going to have to pick up a used housing from Darrell's this week to
be sure of what I'm doing design-wise.

I'm still waiting on my Bentley &amp; Muir.  Things are tight at the moment and
I'm having to put off buying the manuals for a bit.

Thanks.
