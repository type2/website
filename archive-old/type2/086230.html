Subject: Re: [T2] carbs, FI and BN4's

Hi Rob,

On my stock 2.0L FI engine, the right (passenger) side is pretty cluttered 
with air filter, AFM, vacuum hoses, etc. (makes jumping or replacing the 
battery a little tough)  However, the left side of my engine room is pretty 
sparse.  Really the only thing sticking into the left side is the spare tire 
well, and I imagine a BN4 will fit OK in there.  Also, you're in the right 
place for the Eberspacher duct to go thru the firewall and into the 
passenger compartment.

Be careful!  Carbs are pretty easy to deal with, but FI is more complicated. 
  However, if you get it dialed in right, it's WAY better than carbs, 
especially if you're traveling in the mountains.

Good luck!
