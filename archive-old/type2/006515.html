That sounds like a Hunter balancing system.  Does it use a fixture that
mounts on the wheel rather like a strange wheel cover, with some shiny knobs
sticking out of the center?  And is the wheel spun with a powered roller
that looks something like a clunky floor polisher?

The Hunter system takes a little training to operate correctly, but done
right it gives a balance job that is unsurpassed.  The entire rotating mass
at each wheel is balanced, at speeds equivalent to 100MPH+.  The machine not
only indicates the amount and position of weights on the outside periphery
of the wheel/tire assembly, it also indicates weight to be added to the
inside rim so the wheel is balanced in both planes.

If you want to be super precise, next time you have a balance job at this
place take along a flashlight with a strong magnetic base.  Before starting
the balancing attach the flashlight to the bumper or some place close to the
wheel being serviced, and watch the beam of light against the wall, etc., as
the balancing proceeds.  A good operator can make that light absolutely
steady [i.e. no vibration at that wheel/hub] at _all_ rotation speeds, and
will re-check after installing the weights.

By the way, I've dealt with the local Les Schwab store for over 10 years,
and they have never had a problem computer balancing the wheels on
Buses/transporters including early style 15&quot; rims.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  The only game I can find here in Great Falls Montana is an ol boy who
spin
balances the wheels mounted on your car.  The machine looks like it's from
the 50's, it spins the wheel and uses a strobe to detect the true-ness.
I've asked around at other tire stores and am told it's a great system since
the brake drum, lugs and nuts are all balanced in place.  It's just an old
time consuming process and the high volume guys don't want to mess with it.
