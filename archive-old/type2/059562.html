Subject: wiper squeaks..

Greetings..

Does anyone have a solution for squeaky wiper blades?  My other wise good
right blade has a terrible squeak on the upstroke and I wondered if there
were any clever solutions to this annoyance...

Cheers,

P.S.  I plan on being in Puyallup this Sunday, so I'll keep my eyes open.
Is there a preconceived meeting place for any listees?
