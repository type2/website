Subject: Ads on Samba

Just a quick note/warning:  I placed my 73 Westy ad on The Samba about 2
weeks ago and, along with several legitimate inqiries, have received 3
separate inquiries with the old scam of, &quot;I'll pay you with a cashiers check
drawn on a US bank, but the check is for $8000 so you'll need to
Western-Union the difference back to me right away.&quot;  Yeah right.  Obviously
someone is trolling The Samba looking for saps.
