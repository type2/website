Hello;  In the early 80's I cut the roof off a 63 21 window from the belt
line, and welded it on to the cut off top of my 69 van.  My  family is
tall, and we enjoyed the van for one summer before a neighbour offered me
so much money for it that I had to sell it to him.  He then moved to
Victoria and I never saw the van again.  It was an idea I had since high
school, and even though it required a lot of work, I was very proud of it. 
I left the wipers on and regularly used the roof ventilation system.  That
was about the same time I built a side car for my motorcycle, and had to
argue with the motor vehicle branch for a full year to get it approved.  I
finally gave up and cut it up when it seemed to me that the hard part of
inventing things is to get government approval for road-worthy-ness.
