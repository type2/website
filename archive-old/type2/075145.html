&gt; Now I love giving advice and helping everyone out and getting help.  But when
&gt; someone tells you after writing how to fix a problem, please at least
&gt; entertain me by going outside and trying the troubleshot yourself.  If the
&gt; problem is not solved on your Westy or bus then, continue to ask for help but
&gt; at least let us know you tried our advice.
