&gt;Since I started this thread (and it originally had nothing to with
&gt;what it evolved into) and since it's Friday, and since SURPRISINGLY
&gt;the Admins have not yet killed it,

Well, I was the guy that first responded with the comments on the
TV.  I meant it to provoke debate, but the debate got large pretty
quick.  The way I handled that problem was to simply stop posting on
the thread.  I mailed you privately on Wednesday, ferinstance.

&gt;Bad parents who are un-invloved in their childrens lives is what is
&gt;harmful to kids,

Agreed.

&gt;As a matter of fact, the TV in the bus is just something that makes
&gt;it easier to take our children on these far away bus campouts.

I think there is an underlying assumption here that having kids should
not change one's life-style at all - that if one drove all day to get
to a campout without kids, then one should still be able to drive all
day to the campout _with_ kids, by doing whatever it takes to keep
the kids happy during the drive.  I disagree with this premise.

&gt;So, if the options are: 1) Leave the kids with the babysitter for the
&gt;weekend so I can go to a campout OR 2)Put a boob-tube in the bus to
&gt;make the trip tolerable for everyone, then I am choosing #2.

There are at least two more options that I can think of.  3) Don't go
on the trip.  4) Go on shorter trips.

&gt;So, Admins, before any one else has some &quot;helpful&quot; advice to give,
&gt;PLEASE KILL THIS THREAD!!

It doesn't work that way.  The thread doesn't get killed after you have
the last word.

&gt;Now for bus content:  I have gotten the Aux battery hooked up in the
&gt;Westy, it works and charges as it should when the gen is cranking.

Good deal!  Were either of the Library links helpful, or did you find
another write-up that was better?
