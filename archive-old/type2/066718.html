Anton,

that stuff didn't work for me. I applied it to a brand new Dansk exhaust
pipe that I had sanded down to bare metal. The stuff was let dry for a few
days, then installed. Didn't take long for the paint to bubble up and come
off in flakes. Btw, unlike the name would suggest, POR-20 should *not* be
painted over rust.

Maybe I did something wrong in the prep work and it's my fault, but I
don't know what. 

Meine 2 Groschen :)
