The subject of heating our busses has filled many pages lately.  I also
submitted a post with a few questions and also asked if anyone had a source of
the steel sleeves and gaskets that fit into the accordions tubes that fit to
the heater control boxes.  As in most cases list members offered advice.

One member, Karl von Salzen replied saying he was trying to locate a set for
me and had visited one wreaking yard without luck but would try another
tomorrow.  I replied to Karl thanking him, and told him just let me know what
he wanted for them and I would send the money.

A day or so later, another e-mail from Karl asking for my address and saying
he had found a set and they will be in the mail.  Again I asked what he wanted
for them.  I had expected to pay for the parts and a little extra for his
trouble

Karl's reply   Marry Christmas

I have to admit, I was surprised somewhat touched.  Most people wont go out of
their way for the guy next door, let alone a person they have never spoken to
or met.  

Someday I may cross paths with Karl and thank him in person.  Southern
California is in the middle of a cold spell so I am thanking him each morning
for the improved heat my bus now has.

I just wanted the list to know the type of person I have found Karl to be. 

Marry Christmas and a Happy New Year to list members and their family's

Don Miller
