&gt;Her '71 DP bus is basically bucking between gears. She says when she
&gt;shifts, she feels like the bus is pulling back on her. She said the bus has
&gt;basically no power, but she also told me that she's able to make speeds of
&lt;50-60...so there's *some* power there.

Sounds like the 34.3 that the 2nd mechanic put on is not adjusted properly.
It also sounds like the gas cable linkage is screwed up. Either the return
spring on the carb or the cable adjust at carb is off.The Fuel pump could
certainly be bad. There could be a leak in the servo hose, or at the base
of the gasket. try to adjust the 34.3, then I'd be tempted to return to the
30pict, adjust the gas cable and see if that changes anything. Next I would
check and/or swap on your fuel
pump, check the clutch pedal free-play and the point gap, easy things. Then
maybe the servo hose and tightness of the intakes etc. Last thing you want it
to be is problems in the bell housing - but it could certainly be clutch
related.
