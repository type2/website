BuySell at www.type2_dot_com is working again, thanks to its author Yvan
Rodriguez. Before it went out of service a few weeks ago this classified ad
board was doing around 35 ads per day, all aircooled VWs, probably the most
high-traffic aircooled classifieds in existence. Check it out if you want
to buy or sell.

Go to http://www.type2_dot_com and click the Buy &amp; Sell button.
