Subject: [T2]age old question(OIL)

 76 bus newly rebuilt 1800 maybe 10,000 miles on it maybe...?
 
i have been using Castrol SAE40 for a good long while now and change oil every 3000 miles.....with oil filter...and regular valve adjustment etc etc....
 
i need to change my oil grade as i dont think that the oil i am using happens to be thick enough.
my oil temp gauge has slightly went up from the temps outside and i really would like to change my oil next week to a thicker oil preferably(time for a cgange within 500 miles bnow) (Castrol) but there again just want to use the best thing i can for the engine i love so; not to ruin it and also want to make sure that the oil isnt to thick so it dont do whatever will happen when using to thick of a oil.
 
imagine might blow off oil filter or something maybe...?if to thick??? or mess up rings or something?
i dont know....
i have read over the libary articles and archives but wanted to maybe touch base with someone on the list of the best oil i should use given the engine i have....
friend of mine suggested synthetic oil but i cant however afford that type of oil and dont really know enough about it to buy it if i could afford 6 bucks a qaurt shhheeesh it must be good hmmm maybe???...
 
so i guess raise of hands here maybe would help...
those with or have had a 1800 rebuilt engine what oil did you use.... how were your temps...
and on another note...
 
winter is approaching temps will be getting down there within next month to month in a half so please take that into consideration also for whatever oil i should use...still warm during day but cool at night closer to halloween will have to break out a coat possibly for night.
 
my friend that rebuilt the engine for me lives off of 10 w 40 would this be ok for me or would 20 w 50 be just to much...?  is 10 w 40 strong enough for everday driving and sometimes extreme temps etc. or is 20 w 50 to strong
 
or am i safe at sae 40 even though i think its what is causing my high temps on the hotter days maybe? oil is just to thin...possibly in my thoughts here.
 
thanks for any and all help or advice

Peace,Love&amp;Earth
