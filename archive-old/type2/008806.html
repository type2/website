Hi Everybody!

The time is drawing near for Everybus! The campout will take place on April
16,17,18 in Pleasant Garden, NC at Hagan-Stone Park. We have reserved 30
campsites in the &quot;A&quot; RV loop and each site has hookups and a picnic table.
There is room for lots more buses in the adjacent RV and tent loops. The fee
is $12.00 per night per campsite which includes use of the bath house!

Here is a link to the site that has all the info you need:including maps and
directions!

There will most likely be a lot of kids at this campout so if you got 'em
bring 'em. There is a great playground at the campground for the kids and 
lotsa room for them to run around and do what they do best:)
