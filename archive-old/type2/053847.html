Subject: Too much advance   HELP!

HELP!

What could make my spark advance run on out to 50 degrees?

It seemed to happen slowly, and at first I thought it was the points, so I put
in new ones but no change. I started using premium and retarded the dist until I
could find a dist, and just put in a rebuilt one today. I did not replace the
dual vac advance because it seemed fine, moving the plate and holding vaccume.

All of the vaccume lines and elec. plugs look great.

The book says 7.5 degrees BTDC, but I have it set now at 8 degrees ATDC to bring
the advance to 32 at 3000 rpms.

computer? (how?)  EGR?

It is a '73 engine in a '76 with FI.

Thanks
