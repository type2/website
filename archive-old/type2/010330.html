Subject: Fast Idle Still a Mystery

Hi Again VWbussers--
I wrote recently about my mysterious high idle, which reared its head
following the replacement of my alternator/voltage regulator.  I'm now
noticing more symptoms that I thought I'd pass along in hopes of some help.
 (I can't bear to do another archive search on yet another variation of
this theme.)  First of all, I'm still convinced this is vacuum leak-related
because the idle is more erratic now.  The idle seems fine when the engine
is cold -- although somewhat higher than when normally warm, I attribute
that to the cold start and aux. air valves doing their thing -- but now
when it warms up the idle stays at the higher level and even creeps up; it
also seems to alternate between being within RPM specs at one stop light to
being obviously too high at the next.  And the idle tends to stay up in the
higher ranges as the engine gets hotter -- as when in stop &amp; go traffic,
for example.  Another symptom I also noticed tonight: when I got home and
pulled into the driveway, the idle was really up there.  I turned the
engine off, and then started it right up again -- and the idle immediately
seemed to back down within the normal RPM range.  Huh?  The engine runs
great, has no trouble starting and although high, the idle is smooth.

Let me add that I have triple-checked all vacuum hoses as best I can
(finding no disconnects or evident leaks), and have tested both the aux.
air regulator and decel valve -- both checked out OK.  I have not given in
and touched the FI idle adj. screw yet.

Do any of the above symptoms sound familiar to anybody -- familiar enough
for someone to steer me in the right direction for hopefull
narrowing/tracking this one down?  Thanks for your continued help...
