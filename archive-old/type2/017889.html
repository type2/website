Subject: Alternator backing plate Q and need Type IV oil cooler mounting studs
Message-Id: &lt;37309E3D.F4D5.0290.000_at_MHS&gt;

Listees,

	As a small part of my more comprehensive efforts to cure a
persistent overheating problem and maximize the efficiency of my cooling
system, I have encountered two issues.  I*d appreciate any assistance
y*all could offer.  The van is a 1970 Westfalia with a 1600 cc dual port
motor.

	Alternator Backing Plate:  Some time ago, I switched from a
generator to an alternator.  I have a dog house fan shroud.  I have heard
of alternator and generator backing plates (i.e. the plate that holds the
alternator to the fan shroud).  To be honest, I am not really sure of the
origin of my backing plate. It could be from the source of the dog house
shroud (1974 bug) or from the single port bug motor (?? origin) that
provided the generator.  Does it make a difference?  Why?  How can I tell
which one I have?  [I do have the 34mm fan which is correct for the dog
house shroud.]

	Studs for conversion to Type IV oil cooler:  I am planning to
convert to a Type IV oil cooler (40% larger cooler, installs in stock location
w/ modifications to fan housing).  I have all the parts for the conversion
except the longer studs required to hold the larger Type IV cooler in
place.  There are three studs used to bolt the oil cooler in place (on both a
Type I and Type IV engine).  One is short and the other two are longer
and of equal length.  If anyone has access to two of the longer studs
&gt;from a Type IV motor (either new or *recycled* from an old motor), I*d be
interested in talking to you.  For those who might comment, I do not
imagine that the Type IV cooler will solve my overheating problem.  I do
hope that once the underlying problem is cured, this will help the motor
stay cool in the hot weather we have here in the Washington, D.C. area
and on summer journeys in even more southerly climes.

	All of this is part of a larger effort to identify the real cause of my
overheating problem and fix it.  If my efforts don*t succeed, I suspect
you*ll get all the details, but for now I am omitting the details in the
interests of brevity.

	Thanks in advance for all your help!
