In theory it can accelerate wear in the hinges and opening/closing
mechanism.

Regardless. I've been doing it for nearly 23 years and have never had a
problem.  Best to have screens in place, though, to stop flying debris and
errant bug-type critters.

The 1970 Campmobile manual doesn't address the issue - I don't know about
other years.

&gt;From my perspective the main drawback is that the corners of the window
frames can be very sharp.  Accidentally brushing or bumping them when
they're extended can cause a nasty wound [and I have the scars to prove it].

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Is there any problems asociated with driving a Westy with the long side
louver windows open?  &lt;&lt;
