Subject: Re: [T2] Which SVDA Distributor????

 Hello friends, I was wonder what you all thought
 about this....   Im looking
 at getting an SVDA but there are a few to choose
 from....   The one from
 Aircooled_dot_net I heard was supposed to be good as
 they tune the vacuum can for
 your engine type....   BusDepot_dot_com has the Bosch
 German SVDA for the same
 price...  Ive also seen one at partsamerica_dot_com for
 48 dollars!!!!   The first
 two mentioned are both 129 dollars....
 Has anyone had any experiences with any of
 these?????
 Any input is appreciated...
 
 I have a 78 type 2 camper with a 2 litre and stock
 FI...

Unless someone did you a 'favor' by replacing your
original distributor with a 009, you ALREADY have a
SVDA!!!

Why do you want to buy another one??

There is NOTHING wrong with the curve of the dist you have.
