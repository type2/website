Subject: Advice on bus '71 Westy restoration need

Greetings all....

Well I'm finally able to start getting my '71 hard top Westy back on the 
road. little history.... two years ago bought a '68 pop-top Westy with the 
hope of restoring it. The interior was in excellent condition, motor &quot;still 
running last time I started it&quot;, and the body so-so. The interior I took out 
and stored (it was in really really excellent condition), the engine turned 
out to be in no where near to &quot;running&quot; condition (the sellers memories were 
a bit clouded), and the body was in far far worse condition than I could have 
imagined (never buy a bus on a New England winter night... a foot of snow hid 
the bottom of the bus when I looked at it). I assumed that the better than 
excellent interior would be indicative of the frame and body condition... not 
so... rust, rust, holes and more rust... oh well. So took out the Westy 
interior and anything else that I could possibly use in the future. About 
that time I followed up on a bus FS that was posted in the type2-digest 
Digest. Turned out to be a '71 hardtop Westy with a spent engine just an hour 
north of where I was living. Bought it and now I;m about to get it back on 
the road.

INTERIOR: am going to put in the Westy interior from former '68 bus. Have 98% 
of the parts I need, a copy of a Westy interior &quot;manual&quot; (really parts 
catalog), and the experience of totally redoing the interior of my '74 bug. 
Should be quite a difference with all that room to work in. The '74 is a 
Super Beetle and accessing the wiring from beneath the dash is impossible 
without taking the seats out, take the seats out and then it's just a 
plain pain.... This seem like the easiest part of the whole project.

ENGINE: Well as of now either rebuilding it with the help of a friend or 
buying one to put in. All boils down to $$$.$$. I would like to know if 
anyone were to put a &quot;new&quot; engine in a '71 bus what you would advise me to do.
Stock? or ???, reliability is my prime concern.

BODY: Here's where I'm stuck. The body is all original, very oxidized but 
original off-white top and green bottom paint. Only maybe 4 quarter size 
surface rust eruptions to redo above the bumper level...no problem there, All 
window rubber is original but not a leak to be found. Now below bumper level 
is the rust in forms of maybe a half dozen rust thru holes maybe 2-4 inches 
in diameter in all the usual places. The metal around the holes is amazingly 
still solid. The panel below the sliding door will have to be replaced. 
Fortunately the door's sliding mechanism is still very solid. Advice on 
fixing these rust holes is needed. To me it would seem that I should just cut 
these areas out, weld in replacement metal, and finish off. Carefully done 
with minimal Bondo should work, but I keep hearing and seeing examples of 
doing just this and having rust come thru the new paint 2 to 3 years down the 
line. HELP..... I'm not looking for a 100% show bus but one which will look 
really nice that I can use several times a year for trips and maybe once a 
week around town. Because of the salt they use around here in the winter I 
think I'll keep the bus inside then. After restoring the '74 Bug, I had to 
use it for 3 winters and that was one winter too much. Fortunately there are 
only three border areas of paint &quot;bubbling&quot; that I have to redo. Am thinking 
of doing the body work myself.... just taking the time till I'm satisfied 
with the work... figuring on x10 times the time a body shop would take and 
then adding a few more hours for mistake corrections. Advice? Does that seem 
feasible?

Wish I won the lottery and could just send the '71 bus out to be redone.. 
then I could look into the mid 60's camper that is hiding behing this old 
house... but then that's another story.

Thanks for listening,

Greg
