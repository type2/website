	[Crick, Bill ]  Mike seemed to ask
&gt;  &gt;And when I buy that long block 2.0L rebuilt, or used, engine do I have
&gt; to
&gt; find
&gt; &gt;the specific fuel injection system for the CA manual trans, auto trans,
&gt; 49
&gt; &gt;state manual trans, auto trans, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, GD or GD, hyd
&gt; or
&gt; &gt;mech lifter engine?
&gt; 
	[Crick, Bill ]  NOTE: THIS IS ONLY AN OPINION!
	 IT SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A FACT!

	I don't think that you need to have everything exactly from the same
year, unless you are worried about 
	meeting a particular emission spec.  A lot of the stuff is basically
the same across at least a few years:
	Aux air valve, throttle body, thermo switch, temp sensor, ballast
resistors, injectors, the basic engine itself, and all the plumbing... IF
you get a compatible kit together, your van should run fine, but maybe not 
	absolutely optimum WRT emissions.

	The things  I think do need to match are: the ECU, and AirFlow meter
should be from the
	same year, and match the engine displacement, and the transmission
type. Mixing ECU, and AFM years
	will probably work but maybe not optimally.

	I think it is a good idea to get a distributor that has the same
vacuum advance can as the ECU was meant for, 
	but there seem to be zillions of variations, and my van is running
just fine on one selected from
	a junkyard with the sole criteria being it had the right number of
vacuum hoses (2). The wrong number
	of hoses on your distributor is probably a way bigger problem than
mixed FI parts. See the endless 009
	distributor discussions, and apparent issues -&gt; Please don't start
up  the 009 thread again!

	Note that in late 76 they number of wires on the AFM changed, and
they changed from, or to
	a mechanical  Exhaust gas recirculation valve: this affects the
throttle body, AFM, EGR, and wiring harness.

	Also  there are zillions of vans running fine out there with broken,
or no EGR valves, so its not
	critical to reasonable operation.  I fiddled to get the EGR valve
working on mine when I restored the FI system
	only to find out after that on the other side of the bukhead, it was
an open pipe that did not connect to the
	 exhaust system in any way! It still doesn't 5 years later!

	Just my opinion as a practical mechanic rather than a purist
