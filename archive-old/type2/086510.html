Subject: fuel sender replacement

------=_NextPart_001_0001_01C1E92F.33549340

Hey,
has anybody done the replacement without pulling the engine, like the arc=
hives suggest.
The guy says to cut a hole in the body to access it and re cover it with =
a plastic screw on boat hatch.
sounds risky to me, but I'd like to know for sure how much gas I have, th=
e needle drops to R after I have a half tank or less.


Also does anybody know a good replacement for the rear table leg on 76-79=
 westys? =20
I'm considering buying a peice of conduit and bending it, but don't know =
the diameter or height to bend at.
