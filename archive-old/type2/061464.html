Subject: Sad News--Josh Rodgers

I got a phone call from Chad Cantwell of Ponca City, Oklahoma, who is a
good friend of Josh Rodgers.

Josh died last night. I was told he took his own life. I don't know much
more than that, probably never will. Chad was very upset and I didn't press
for details.

I have Josh's home address but no permission to spread it. If you feel like
memorializing him somehow, all I can think of to do is put in on your web
page.

I'm very sad right now. Goodbye, Josh, I'm gonna miss you.
