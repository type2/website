Subject: Re: [T2] Oil cooler leaks?

I would look real close at the oil pressure sending unit... it is above the
cooler, leaks under pressure when the engine is running, and fools you into
thinking the cooler is leaking......


&gt; How can I tell if an oil leak is coming from the oil cooler, or something
&gt; else?
&gt; It only leaks while running, or right after being shut down. Engine is an
&gt; 1800 type 4.
&gt; The oil seems to be coming from above the oil filter which makes me think
&gt; it is the cooler. I put a new one on before putting the engine in. Maybe
&gt; i didnt tighten it up?
&gt; Does it sound like this could be my problem?
