Subject: RE: [T2] Torquing Heads

Years ago in conversations with folks at Rimco, I asked about their case
savers, 10mm studs and torque.  I have followed their suggestions and use 30
ft lbs of torque on T1 engines with their case savers only. The heads on my
Bus haven't ever lost torque and I almost never need to adjust the
valves...I'm talking 18,000 miles and maybe a couple valves need a .001&quot;
adjustment.  I still check out of habit anyway at 6K intervals.  It's almost
spooky.

I also use 5/76 and earlier Ford Courier rocker buttons, Part # is
D27Z-6549-C...great modification for more stability.  Use shims and make
sure you have parallel stem/adjuster geometry at half lift.

&gt; Well, he called me back about 15 minutes later and
&gt; says that he just talked to the engine rebuilder
&gt; he got the engine from, who said something along the
&gt; lines of &quot;the heads that are on that engine are Aluminum
&gt; and shouldn't need to be torqued&quot;, in addition to that,
&gt; they are apparently torqued to 28 ft. lbs (as opposed
&gt; to the spec 22-23 ft. lbs specified by Bentley).

Maybe he is using that 'rolling' torque spec that came up on the list a week
or
so ago........[or whatever name was given to compensate for friction or
whatever]
