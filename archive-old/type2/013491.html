Good luck with the seatbelts - i have no idea.  Surprised they have belts in

want to make sure they'll be safe.


I have found numerous posts about replacing the front driver and passenger 
seats on '68-'71 bus with seats out of a '73-'75 bus.  Does anyone have any 
experience with replacing one or both of the rear benches?  I've seen 
benches with headrests in a '78 bus.  Anyone know if they'll fit in a '71?

Thanks again for this great resource.

If anyone's interested, the bus I've found is listed here:
