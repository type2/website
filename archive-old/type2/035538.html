Subject: clutch fork\lever dropped to the bottom...

i put a new clutch cable and bowden tube into my '64 bus today.  when i 
finished this i got in to take a quick test drive, but the clutch pedal fell 
to the ground with a snap sound.  i crawled under and checked the wing nut 
thinking that it stripped or something, but to my dismay, the clutch lever 
was no longer vertical but was now houizontal.  can anyone tell me what it 
will take to fix this inconvenience on my daily driver?   thank you.    ben
