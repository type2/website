Subject: its alive!

Sorry I felt the need to use that as my subject.
Well it runs! Never noticed how I missed the sweet
sound of a air cooled engine, ooo its GREAT!!

Well I got a problem, the exhaust is leaking fairly bad.
It seems its leaking at the heads, where I put on new
exhaust seals. I am thinking maybe the seals have
heat up and expand and they take shape and close of the leaks?
I tighten down the nuts pretty well but I don't want to
mess up the studs, knowing that would be more work :(
So what to do?

Another question
I put in new piston rings and in the &quot;Wilson&quot; book it said
to bring idle up to 2000 rpms and hold it for 20 mins.
Any thing else I should do?
also well I be burning oil until the rings -seat-
(don't know if thats the correct term)?

any ways thanks guys and gals, without this list I wound
have NEVER gotten this far, seriously!
I cant wait to take it for a spin, once I get the
all the bugs worked out i'll let you know how the
rebuild went.
