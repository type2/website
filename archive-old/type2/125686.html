Subject: RE: [T2] Head Question

&gt; I have in my hands a head that was presumably rebuilt at one 
&gt; time. SIR is the stamp on the inside. 
&gt; Anyone ever seen this before or know the origin?


SIR was a VW engine rebuilder, somewhere in the southwest if memory
serves me correctly. If I'm not mistaken they went out of business a
couple of years ago. I don't know much about the quality of their work.
