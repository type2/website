Yow!  If you junkyard in California or other lawyer-infested state don't
leave good parts on the ground!  Put them inside the vehicle!  The yards,
having been sued too many times for &quot;trip and fall&quot; injuries have
employees who discard any loose parts laying on the ground, much to the
detriment of those of us who collect heat exchangers, tin, etc.
