Subject: Re: [T2] rebuilt dist.

Tony and all other Volks,

&gt; Can't seem to find the web site with the listings of rebuilt dist. for
&gt; VW's...IIRC, it was buried amongst a ford site...?

Check this place.  You have to drop down a few layers, and it is by engine
manufacture/displacement.

www.philbingroup_dot_com

Hope this is the one.
