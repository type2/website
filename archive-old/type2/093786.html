&lt;&lt; You might consider moving to Germany, where Tu&quot;v will revent those types of busses from driving legally on public roads.  &gt;&gt;

Fortunately, you don't have to go that far.  When I lived in western New York, all vehicles there had to pass at least a rudimentary safety inspection.  

It caught a lot of the kind of vehicles that Dr. Tim describes but unfortunately, many people with the &quot;attitude&quot; he also described were able to find unscrupulous garages who would pass anything for the right price.
