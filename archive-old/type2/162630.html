&gt; Every year the pump in my BA6 stops working.  Every year I give it a wack
&gt; with a screwdriver, windshield scraper, or whatever's convenient and it
&gt; starts working again.  It's pretty easy to tell if it's going or not, I can
&gt; almost hear it from inside the bus.  If I feel it, I can definitely tell if
&gt; it's going or not - the pump pulsates in time with the pulses from the
&gt; combustion blower.  I don't even have to take the bottom cover late off
&gt; anymore.

I've had to whack my BA4 pump occasionally too.
