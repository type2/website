Subject: hydraulic lifters


I tried looking through the archives, but couldn't find the exact answers I
was looking for...  Is it worth getting hydraulic lifters, and have you had
any problems with them?  I'm considering getting a longblock (with
hydraulic lifters if it's worth getting them) from Mofoco. Also, is Mofoco
a good place to buy from, or is there a better company?

Thank you,
Keri
