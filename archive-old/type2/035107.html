&lt;&lt;&lt;If I work the heads (add 2cc's to 2 of the head
chambers) I can get CR's to 7.22,7.20,7.21,7.21.  Is this the type of
balance Bob is talking about.&gt;&gt;&gt;

you do NOT ADD to the head chamber unless you are a very good
machinist/welder.  you can take away/grind out some of the head
chamber area to equal the others.

ccing the heads and compression ratio are similar, but two different
things.  and  different steps are involved to achieve this.

1- cc the heads.  balance all as close as humanely possible.  

2-set piston deck height.  find out if all pistons come up exactly the
same distance in each cylinder at EACH pistons tdc!!  

3-then calculate deck height chamber volume.  do the same way as you
did when cc'ing the heads.  add the two figures together (head cc, and
piston tdc cc)  this is total combustion volume.  

4-must also calculate swept volume (from tdc to bdc) of each piston.

for example add:
head chamber volume+  (cv)
deck volume+          (dv)
swept volume= total cylinder volume  (tcv)

do this 4 times (one for each cylinder)  

so:

compres. ratio =    tcv
                  _______
                  cv + dv

this is the only actual way of calculating compression.  after finding
comp ratio, then add barrel (cylinder) shims to adjust deck height
according to your needs of raising or lowering the compression ratio.

now to add another wrench into it....if you want more cc's in the
heads, send them to g.berg to get hemi-cut.  it adds a good amount of
cc volume, helps lower compression ratio without (usually) needing
barrel shims.  

putting on cylinder heads (balanced ones ) is by far the most time
consuming job.  having smooth heads is a mind blowing lesson in
smooth/strong power.  you have to try it to believe it.  

every engine build i do now, is always balanced.  it is worth it, many
many many times over.
