Subject: Re: [T2] bucket seats


&gt;over the years, why not take advantage.  If you have a charging system in 
&gt;good shape, I'd look for something with heat, air adjustable support, and 
&gt;maybe even electric adjustment

I grabbed the motors, gears, and tracks from an Audi.  I plan on adding 
electric adjustments to my seats in just such a manner!
