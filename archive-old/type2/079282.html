Subject: southern NH and MA listees another FYI

Hi ma and nh listees one more heads up. Holland used auto parts has a 79
brown westy deluxe, engine still there stove and some mystery heater i
have never seen before good glass ok canvas and lots of other bits, also
80-83 vanagon, engine and fi still there. we all know how hard it is to
find buses in junkyards around here, also had a splittie, id say early
60s but it was ontop of a pile 3 cars high still has engine but they
trashed it with the forklift, i HATE holland parts, the employees are
jerks and they treat the cars like crap even if you find the car you
want THEY most likely trashed it, also had a virtually rust free super
bee but they had mangled it with the lift grr i was one unhappy buser.
pmail for more details.
