&gt; wow, that's a ton of carb for a 1600!!  I have dual 36's on my 1776

After driving it, I would say not really. Mine have 28mm venturis
install so that helps also. Besides if you think about it. Whether you
have one venturi (i.e. single carb), or four (dual carbs w/ dual
throats) in a 4 cyl engine only one cylinder will be sucking air into
the combustion chamber at any one time.

Thanks Will (and everyone else) for the insights, I'll be trying all the
suggestions over the next few mornings.
