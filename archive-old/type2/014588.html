Hi all.
I am in need of some of the white plastic parts that are in  interior of
my Westy.
I am looking for the threshold plastic strip, the upper door strip, the
divider on the rear part of the headliner, just below where the upper
bunk hinges, and the hinge cover for the folding table.
Does anyone know if this stuff is available new?
If so where?
Also there is a white plastic box, on the ceiling, in front of the rear
hatch, that I would like to replace with a wood grained storage
compartment, like the 77, 78's have.
It offers a little more storage area.
Is this alteration possible?
Does anyone have one that they would sell? 

Thanks Much,
