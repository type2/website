Subject: Re: [T2] Yikes - Paint is Expensive

The teacher in my autobody repair (an experienced professional painter teaching a night class) class thought highly about Transtar: 

http://www.tat-co_dot_com 

They are a newer, more economical paint manufacturer and their prices are probably lower than any others, but.  We used their stuff, BASF and the PPG stuff in class, and it was no different, really.  They manufacture paint guns also.  I would explore Transtar if price was a major factor with me.  It is available at Finishmasters stores.  I still need to buy my base/clear.  I may just buy Transtar yet.

I am also glad to learn more about Dupont Nason,  I did not like my one experience so far, and I lucked out and ended up with Chroma One for interior single stage, which seems to be just fine.  The Nason reducer makes for a good cleaner for my guns, though.
