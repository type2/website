I've got  the Bosch manuals, is it the same thing? Or do you have a VW 
specific manual?  I'd love a copy of that. =)



hey Don  This is a blue book with AFC(air flow controlled)  fuel  injection  
VW  troubleshooting   type 2 model  1976   on the front cover   doesn't say 
anything about  bosch  See if you can find Hot Dogs site then you could down 
load it from  there.  later  Mark Dearing
