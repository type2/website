Subject: Re: V joint 1/2shaft compatible with 76

I was talking about the stub axle.  My apologizes!!!
Kinda what I get for jumping in the middle of the thread.  The stub axles
did change but I do not know about the inner and outer CV axle shaft?

&gt; I wrote &quot;*think*&quot; for '68-72 half shafts because I have owned a '73, a
&gt; '76, a '78, and a '79 and all those half shafts were interchangable, but I
&gt; have not owned a '68-72. so I don't *know* if they are the same.
&gt;
&gt; In reading Mr. Lafoon's experience it sounds like his problem was with the
&gt; stub axle, which carries the rear brake drum and the rear wheel bearings.
&gt; The stub axle is a different part. VW changed from a solid to a composite
&gt; rear brake drum in the '71-'72 range, and I would bet that the stub axle
&gt; length changed at that time. This does not mean that the half shaft length
&gt; changed, tho.  If I am mistaken, Rob, and you were talking about the half
&gt; shaft, which extends from the transmission to the stub axle, tho, please
&gt; let me know.

&gt; I hate to disagree (or it could be the dyslexia) with the
Co-administrator,
&gt; Mr. Dolan, but I must.  The 68-72 shaft is a different length than the
&gt; 73-79.  The 68-72 is about a 1/2 inch shorter than the 73-79.  Last year I
&gt; stripped the stub axle on my 72 and ordered one through Ronnie of
&gt; Type2parts_dot_com and the one he sent was the 73-79 and I did not notice the
&gt; length difference till after I tried to tighten the nut down and would not
&gt; tighten anymore and still had a gap so I pulled it off and laid it next to
&gt; the stripped axle and it was longer so I called Ronnie and he sent another
&gt; (the right one) no charge
