&gt; MAYBE just MAYBE you will get one.

Well if as conjectured the 3-5 color photocopied sheets are the catalog,
I must admit sheepishly that I recieved the &quot;catalog&quot; back with my very
first order near a year ago, though have not recieved the whopping
6-7 page new version.  If this is indeed it, I got news for them, come
on guys, shit just list every damn part you sell with a price beside
it from the freakin spreasheet you must run inventory on, print it
out photocopy and send out.  Thats basically all the Parts Place
listings for buses and vans were 2-3 catalog back and would surely
satisfy me, just a part number, years of applicability, and price list.
