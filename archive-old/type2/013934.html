Subject: Re: [T2] Electrical

Most of the time this is a battery problem.
See if the sides of your battery are bulged out, this is a sign that you
have plates that are shorting out.
The bttery shows a full charge but just can't maintain a charge than a
few starts.
Crusty battery terminals are also a problem. You could have  a
combination of bad connections that are causing resistance and making the
starter overheat.
The next thing to check is to see if the starter is draging (the armature
touching the field coils) or very short starter brushes that are not
contacting or may be greasy.

Take your time and check the wiring for very thin connections (not full
set of wires going to connectors).
