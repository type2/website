Subject: Re: [T2] auxiliary air regulator help

Sorry to hear that, Mark. The only service I have done to those is flushing
them out and picking loose any crud with a small screwdriver or dental
scraper, without taking them apart. I haven't a clue as to how you would
put one back together. They just aren't designed to be taken apart. Unless
you can figure out how, best get a replacement.

&gt;Thanks for the info.  I stuck it in the fridge and it opened up a little
&gt;more; not *all* the way, but more.  But, I'm guessing a little can go a
&gt;long way with the amount of rpm changes the idle speed screw can make.
&gt;
&gt;Now, I pulled out the element to clean the housing out.  What should I
&gt;use to glue it back in.  It seems like a pretty tight fit, but I don't
&gt;want the element to spin within the regulator housing..
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Mike

&gt;&gt; Put it in you freezer for 10 minutes. At 0=B0F it should be fully open.=
 As it
&gt;&gt; warms up it will slowly close. Hook it to 12v and it should close in 2 or=
 3
&gt;&gt; minutes. Flush it out with carb cleaner if it's sticky.

&gt;&gt; &gt;So, I was wondering why my idle was low at startup, and I probably
&gt;&gt; &gt;should have checked the regulator way back when..
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;I tried blowing through it and it didn't let anything through, even
&gt;&gt; &gt;though the engine was cold.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;So, I took it off and took it apart and got the little flap moving
&gt;&gt; &gt;descently.  I'd like to take it apart and regrease it, but it looks like
&gt;&gt; &gt;it's pressed shut, so there isn't much I can do.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;One thing I'm trying to figure out is if the opening is wide enough.  I
&gt;&gt; &gt;took two pictures:
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;This pic with the smaller opening is how it is when the metallic strip
&gt;&gt; &gt;is holding the flap open.
&gt;&gt; &gt;http://www.csulb_dot_edu/~msoultan/slightly-open.jpg
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;This pic with the bigger opening is me holding it even wider with a
&gt;&gt; &gt;screwdriver.
&gt;&gt; &gt;http://www.csulb_dot_edu/~msoultan/open.jpg
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Does it need to open as much as it is in the second pic, or is the first
&gt;&gt; &gt;opening ok?  Does someone have a cold one that they can compare to?
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Thanks,
&gt;&gt; &gt;Mike
