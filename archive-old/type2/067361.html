&gt;original blue paint down to bare metal and,

SOUND LIKE AN AXE JOB TO ME (gas axe- heat gun,shouldnt warp body, but be
careful)

&gt;now has bits missing and finally

TRY UNCLE THOMS BUS PAGE - there are some very nice wiring diags there. i
think there are some size plans there as well  =20

&gt;3 - finding enough spare parts as is necessary to complete the job!

LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU NEED i might be able to help you and i need to make
some space


&gt;5 - Does anyone know where I can get a kind of &quot;plan&quot; of a bus showing
&gt;lengths, widths, floorspace etc as I'm going to design a new kind of=
 interior
&gt;for her, money permitting?

I SORT OF DESIGNED MY OWN INTERIOR- i needed more seating, i found the
original Devon 4 rear seats a bit cramped with a 2 year old, an old english
sheep dog (dulux dog) and wife=20
ended up having the complete interior at back as seats with equipment under
seats. using the originals plus home made.i can put it back if i like later
i had all the seat squabs (12 in total) + front seats and all panels
proffesionally re-upholstered in Indian Rug. Cost me a total =A3130.00=
 (about
$200)
i considered this very cheap for the finish. i'll let you all in on this guy
if you want.
