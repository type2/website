I'm posting this for a friend (John Larson) who has been an active member on
the 914 list for years.  I've never seen this bus, but I know John well
enough through his contributions to the list to trust his assessment of the
bus' condition.  Any questions, please reply to him at
jdlarson_at_ix_dot_netcom_dot_com    Also, although he didn't mention it in his post, I
believe this bus has a 5 speed Porsche 901 transmission in it.

There comes a time when things change, and this is that time for me.
I've decided to sell my 1973 2.4 911 Avant. Some Bay Area listers have
seen it. It's rough looking, but is mechanically sound and is
unbelievably reliable. I've put around 25K miles or less on the top end
overhaul, and put a ton of effort into making it right. Body is rough,
and the interior is tattered, but it goes like stink, and climbs hills
like they weren't even there. Every part used in the conversion, except
the voltage regulator, is available from either Porsche or VW. I made it
easy to service, and have used it for vacations, towing, swap meet
weekends, and moving. It gets reasonable mileage (sure, like I can keep
my foot out of it) and uses no oil other than a little leakage. I'm
selling it for far less than it would cost to do over again. Pix
available this weekend. $5.5K. Less than that, I'll keep it. John
