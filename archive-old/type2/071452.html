Can't say as I've ever heard of that, either. Just put a rear right window 
in. Took forever to get the rubber on the window, but once I (WE!) got that 
done, the window zipped in the bus frame in less than 5 mins with a helper 
(My So's cousin). Doing the string trick, I pulled on the string from the 
inside, he did CPR type motions on the outside of the window where it met the 
rubber as we went around. Got a storm the next day and no leaks at all. Much 
admired by both of us... especially after neither one of us had done it 
before.
