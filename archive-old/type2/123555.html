Subject: hightail it down to mexico

we got on the road 12/04/03 in the 75 FI westfalia with no definate plans,
except a destination for baja sur, where jingle bells takes a back seat to
high water temps and good surf. along with my wife, three children ages 7,
4, and 11 months, and our 9 year old border collie we left from eugene. we
stopped off in mt. shasta and spent the night at the caswell state park
between tracy and modesto. the following morning  we essentially cut from
99 back onto 5 using 165 through los banos. then, about thirty miles before
grapevine i got two or three tugs reminiscent of the ones felt during the
trip last summer to port townsend. on that trip i learned what a cracked
rubber elbow on the aux air regulator can do. had one spare and i pulled
into a rest stop at the north base of grapevine to install it. too hot to
work on, i melted an ice cube in 30 seconds on the regulator and still had
to wait a half hour. i put the elbow on just so the tip of the elbow
covered the regulator. i think being too agressive and shoving the whole
sleeve thing on may have made it crack - dunno, need more data. made it
over that 4000' mountain and parked at the doheny state beach in san juan
capistrano. both parks are neat clean and well organized, but we didn't
stay long enough to enjoy them: just sleeping time with a d.i.l.d.o.e.
(duck in late duck out early). two days mostly on interstate 5 put us in
shooting distance of the mexican border. in the morning we took time for
two stops.

first i hit up the extremely fancy SJC dealership for a spare elbow or
three. no dice, but they did provide an immaculate throne fit for a king,
coffee, the new vw calendar, and a tip to head to unique auto in mission
viejo for aftermarket parts. great place, supply, service. i bought six
elbows for the trip (dint use any of them) for twelve dollars, no tax. the
replacement i had on board was from bow wow in seatlle and it cost four
bucks, same manufacturer, part number, go figure. listening to my engine
run, the fellers around back thought i probably wouldn't make it far with
the tapping sound. like the mechanics in eugene, and listees here, they
reminded me the cam rivets were the weak component in this engine. i was
glad to find they were in the process of tearing down a low mileage 1800
that had just sucked a valve, and offered me the sweet-looking camgear,
already bolted to its shaft, as travel insurance. second, we stopped at bob
greenup's in leucadia just before he headed off to the pomona swap. at
midday we crossed at tijuana with the wave of a hand.

by this point i realized that our timing was off, and some things had
gotten out of control which isn't an altogether terrible thing before
heading to mexico. in retrospect its probably to be encouraged. but at the
time it wasn't so funny. we left eugene at 10 am, roughly six hours late.
we left caswell around 10am, so we caught friday night rush hour in LA.
this was a notable problem since shifting into first gear, and downshifting
into second was becomming difficult. in capistrano i adjusted the plate at
the shifter, and it seemed all was well enough again. however, once again
on the interstate saturday morning i realized i was just an aircooled loaf
in a lexus-suv-world and late starts chunked badly into my sleeping time.
it was clear the vacation hadn't begun.

the early afternoon held me in tijuana while having the rear facing seat
recovered and exchanging into pesos. have you ever driven tijuana on a
saturday afternoon? DO NOT. 15 minutes to go one block on the main drag.
around 4pm we hit the toll road and the rest of highway 1. slept off the
side of the road near santa ynez. in the afternoon i ran outta gas 5km
short of guerrero negro and sat on my bumper to beg on the side of the road
with an empty gas can. three pemex stations closed in a row! first car
stopped and three mexican fullbacks got out and swarmed both sides of the
road looking for a makeshift tow rope. while that was going on, a farmer
from idaho stopped by a moment later. he hit me up quick with a gallon so
we could all continue. i knew gas mileage was gonna be an issue.

with the exception of my birthday dinner feast in san ignacio,
http://www.efn_dot_org/~stevo/sanignaciolarge.jpg i drove all next day to a
trailer park south of mulege, that i found the next morning was called el
coyote, for another quick duck in. drove all the next day to la paz but
immediately got a sense the city wasn't in the cards this trip. with the
shifter getting worse, coupler i imagine, and a stronger desire to see the
children in the ocean rather than the sea of cortez, i decided to bolt
across the tip of the peninsula to todos santos. we arrived at nightfall.
from tijuana to todos santos i drove nearly a thousand miles and spent
about two hundred in gas, no oil burned or leaked. by the time we arrived
in todos santos it was too dark to find a dirt road to a beach. i stopped
in at the muerto pescado (restaurant, yup) asking for a lead on some
internet-researched campgrounds on beaches, but instead took an invitation
to camp behind the restaurant.  the restaurant was adjacent to an arroyo,
and firewood washes down with the rains. my four year old and i gathered
enough wood for a long fire while my wife heated thanksgiving leftovers
(?curried turkey in mexico?). having no business that evening, the owners
of the place joined us and we watched shooting stars until 10pm. five days
driving - we had arrived.

at this point we still hadn't gotten mexican insurance, nor paid for five
tourist cards issued in guererro negro, the baja sur border. we visited
federal checkpoints three times, each having sunbaked kids with a seemingly
silly seriousness. going down with a family is altogether different... &quot;a
donde va...si, luego&quot;. whatever they're looking for on the way south it is
not in an orange bus with three kids.

the next real town south of todos santos is pescadero. we spent the next
ten days on a beach on the site of the former campground called los
cerritos. same name as the beach. seems the latest hurricanes wiped out the
services, but hasn't held back the recreational vehicles and surfers from
free camping and playing musical dig-the-hole in the nearby arroyo. people
still flock there for perfect sunsets
http://www.efn_dot_org/~stevo/sunsetsculpture.jpg and nearly consistant waves
for those of all skill levels, long or trick boards. the rv crowd mostly
hangs back off the beach 100 yards. they're older snowbirds from british
columbia, playing recorded bagpipes of amazing grace each sunset.
http://www.efn_dot_org/~stevo/sunsetcerritosbeach.jpg though not live pipes, i
got to re-live my father's funeral every night. younger folks stradled the
berm between hard and soft sand opting to be right-on the beach, with views
of the nightly over-stocked bonfire and hit sounds of the 70's. who'da
thunk firewood was so plentiful where all you see is cactus, cactus,
cactus. mexican fences up in smoke.

pescadero has everything except a bank: an agua mineral plant (reverse
osmosis) where you can fill up your 5 gallon jugs, or rent each one for 5
dollars each, around the corner from; surf rentals and supplies at surf
camp (along with luxury acapulco-style camping in gourmet palapas, stools
anchored in the swimming pool and dish tv. only place for a hot shower too.
i pulled my bus in there for one night - right upto the community kitchen
nobody used except us. the guests were talking low brow about los cerritos.
couldn't wait to get there). down on hwy 19 are a full service grocery
store;  beer and purified ice shops; laundry; and the town is getting pemex
soon, the building is up. all this about a mile long bumpy dirt road
ride/walk from the beach. in the late mornings lovely women come by the
beach with empinadas, burritos, and tomales. fisherman come around in the
afternoon with giganticist shrimp. one day for a change we bought fish at
point lobos when the boats came in after 2:30. like my four year old said,
why should we ever leave? well after 10 days we left.

on the morning of 12/23/03 we returned our bottles and got our deposits,
and arrived a few miles south of loreto for the night at a beach called
juancalito. the next morning i noticed a spit of land connecting a
relatively pint-sized island. it separated a cove which i found later was
called el requeson. intending to rest there a few hours we spent all
afternoon pullling and shucking foot-long scallops out of the sand during
low tide. http://www.efn_dot_org/~stevo/scallop.jpg we had them over pasta and
left the following morning. a kilo of hot tortillas and exploring in
mulege, and then it happened. i could hardly stop driving. except for lunch
and a french bakery stop (yep, since 1901) in santa rosalita, i drove
straight to eugene on a total of three hours sleep. i really enjoyed this
hopping town, i never saw so many old, wooden marvelously crafted buildings
in all of mexico combined. turn of the century too, i read it was a french
mining town until a few decades ago. its a much bigger scene than what
appears from the highway. this town is a must stop going either direction
on baja. sorry i missed it during previous trips, but glad i found it now.
so yah, two days from bahia concepcion to eugene and the bus wouldn't let
go of me. 1800 miles with one set of 18 hours and another 22 hours filled
inbetween with three hours sleep among the dozens of vert new beetles at
the SJC vw dealership. we got home chrismas eve morning. couldn't
completely skip the holiday away from grandmaul afterall.

however, on the northbound there were no less than nine pit stops with
federales, each taking time to marvel at the children and their crayon
drawlings. they never noticed the dead guy in the front seat. when it came
time to settle at the border we put the tourist cards away and told the
feller we had been in tijuana for the day getting upholstery done, saving
us a hundred bucks. 'course this was 2:30am, none of it made sense. wound
up panning insurance which i don't recommend - nuts. too much stress
without it. haven't calculated mileage, but enjoyed the ending of the gas
mileage thread when i returned. now i'm looking forward to tearing down the
engine to fix the tapping noise that all think is worn cam rivets, but what
i cannot understand is why the noise wasn't there before teardown last
year, and why it arrived upon startup this year. anyway, i'll have peace of
mind with NOS lifters, and a better crank where the woodruff key is more
stable, not loctited.

on the road south i didn't see but one acvw - a beetle in socal, and then
bob's 70 hardtop westy in leucadia. in baja i saw surprisingly few buses
and beetles as if acvw's were from another era long goneby which i didn't
expect at all. mostly vanagon wassers, save for one minty split bus heading
south on my northbound. pescadero beach had one 72 pop top from vancouver,
b.c., and on my last day a champagne edition westy appeared with montana
plates who'd been to costa rica in it. wish we'd chatted more.

all-in-all a good trip with all new sights and much gained confidence in
the westy. the road through baja is much improved. though still narrow, and
dangerous at night, it has been mostly resurfaced, and construction is
ongoing. semi-trucks regularly take both sides of the yellow lines. buses
are loose cannons on the curves. can't wait for the next ride down. let's
all go next winter.  - steve
