Um, no.  You mean in that tiny (3-4 mm?) opening?  I've got three of them here
on my desk (in addition to the apparently bad one in the bus), and I think they
re the original style, since they match the pictures in the Bentley (fig. 6-5,
p. 29, ch. 10), and do not resemble the one pictured in the RMMW catalog.  And
on page eleven, it says &quot;The pressure regulator cannot be adjusted or repaired
and must, therefore, be replaced if it is faulty.&quot;  Is this a big lie?  and I a
dupe?  I seem to recall the pressure regulator for the D-Jet FI (e.g. type3)
being adjustable, but I don't think I've seen one like that on a bus before.

&gt; When resetting after smog check, try for 2 - 2.5% CO at 2500 RPM.

Sounds good.

&gt; Idle should take care of itself.  Disconnect the charcoal cannister to intake
&gt; air hose or your Idle will be rich.

They don't test me at idle, so I'm not worried about the cannister.

&gt; I have not noticed as much fuel pressure flutter as you describe.  I'll have
&gt; to check mine again and let you know.

Thanks much.
