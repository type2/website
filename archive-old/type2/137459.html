Harbor Freight has a decent lightweight temporary electric winch that I've used/own. DOES NOT have an internal brake so make sure your brakes work well. 

We also use our other car and tow rope ALOT for these manuvers. Getting ready to do it again (tow dolly this time) b/c I found out an hour ago that we just got approved on a house we have been trying to buy. The important features are 2nd bathroom and 2 car garage.
