Subject: Re: sliding door latch

Would someone who actually has the early bay Westy inside sliding door
handle be so kind as to write down the part number for me/us? Or maybe
someone has a photo of one on their web site?

I'm searching high and low on the web, and if I can find a supplier for
these things (crossing fingers) I'll let you know. I'm not feeling
optimistic, though -- I noticed Ron has the standard door handles for
$35.95 (ouch). Although I'd save at least that much in chiropractor
bills if I can find this grail.

TIA,

Nikki

&gt; There originally was a two-ended inside door handle on the Westy, I'm
&gt; told through 74.

&gt; &gt; I have that too! I have to skinny my hand between the ice box &amp; the
&gt; &gt; door to reach the handle.. are you saying there IS an easier way to
&gt; &gt; do this???
