Subject: Re: VW Trends Sucks!!!

Haven't seen a post since Christmas  thought your X-mas post was great even
changed it to write in my X-mas cards.  It does look as if they are going to
coffee can mufflers and saggy kacki drivers.  Kind of a how to make your
German car Japanese!!   Love to see your writings and hope to see more than
2 a year.  Always looking for the person that can write so that you feel the
emotion and Charlie you do so.   Keep writing not just when your pi$$ed
Also have you seen the new VW Custom magazine as it is full of Air cooled
and one of the best mags for our VW's
