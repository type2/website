One thing to check is the condition of the piston's SEAT (the case). These
get corroded, and even new cases have this area pooly machined sometimes.
You have to look at them, and if there's a problem, machine them smooth
again, then shim the spring the same amount you removed to keep correct
tension. While this sounds complicated, it's actually pretty easy, even if
the engine is assembled.

With the right tool. :-)

We rent it and sell it (if you do a lot of em'), if you need one.

we have the tools custom made just for this task!
