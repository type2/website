Subject: Re: [T2] hissing sounds / charcoal canister and HEAT!!!

Hiya Christopher,

I'm not all that familiar with the Type 4 setup in a 76 Bus, but I believe 
that your Emissions Canister (the charcoal filter) should  have the following 
connections....the first would be a 9 mm hose connected to the fan shroud.  
The fan will create a &quot;positive flow/pressure&quot; in this hose.  2.  Another 9 
mm which leads to the air filter.  The draw of the carburetor will create a &quot; 
negative flow/pressure&quot; in this hose.  3. Finally a much smaller hose leading 
to the gas tank through which loose hydocarbons travel.

The flow through the E-Can created by the positive pressure of the fan AND 
the negative pressure of the carb draw those loose hydrocarbons from the 
tank, through the E-Can, into the hose leading to the air filter and 
carburetor where they are burned.  When the engine is not operating the 
hydrocarbons are &quot;stored&quot; in the charcoal inside the E-Can until this cycle 
is begun once more when the engine is started.

At least, that's the way it works in my 1600.  Hope this helps you figure out 
the routing for the hoses!
