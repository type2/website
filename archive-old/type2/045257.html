Subject: [T2] Re: 914 oil plate (baffle)

That oil baffle that goes over the oil sump might be of some use.  I've
watched the oil pressure drop when cornering hard in a '71 I used to
have.  I think I have a spare one, if you are interested.

I have one of those oil temp plates that you refer to; I think it came
out of a 914, but honestly I don't recall.  It works nicely in a bus
with a VDO sender.  I don't have a spare, but it shouldn't be hard to
fabricate one.
