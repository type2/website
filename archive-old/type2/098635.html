  *UPDATE* - *CANCELLATION*

Dear List,
I just talked to Todd. With the difficulty in reaching anyone on the eve of a holiday weekend he has decided to rent a U-Haul &amp; trailer.

Frustration level rose quickly when trying to call people on the list only to reach lots and lots of numbers that had been disconnected.

Thank you to the list members that gave me advice and kind words.

Peace,
Maui Haui
