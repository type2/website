Does anyone know of a lubricant or something that can prevent the turn
signal lever from freezing up. I have been spraying electrical cleaner into
the switch and that allows me to move the lever for about a day, but then
the turn signal lever freezes up again and I have to use the trusty arm
signals (which btw most other drivers have no idea what they mean!)

It also causes the signal relay to click repeatedly for a little bit while
you're driving, but not activating the lights. The clicking isn't annoying
because the engine noise drowns it out.

Just wondering if there is something to put into it instead of replacing
the switch? Looks like that would be a major chore. Thanks for the input.
