&gt; Look at the Napa #75598 coil-over shocks for the rear.  They fit perfectly
&gt; (on my '72) with a top bolt about 1/2 inch longer than the factory
&gt; bolt.  The ride is much improved and I am very pleased.
&gt;
&gt; Every time this coil-over subject comes up, it provokes several responses
&gt; so I will summarize the results of the last discussion: a half dozen or so
&gt; list members responded that they had used the coil-over shocks and were
&gt; very pleased, 8-10 list members with no first-hand experience whatsoever
&gt; weighed in that they though using coil-overs was a bad idea, only one list
&gt; member with real first-hand experience responded in the negative.

And one listee responded that VW shows a coil-over shock in their parts
book!
