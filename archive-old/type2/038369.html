Subject: Re: Vanagon Connection - Fast German Auto

When I went to Fast German with an oil leak problem they
just shook their heads and chuckled and said that I should
know that all air cooled engines leak oil.

The 2.4L is the best for your bus. Powerful yet very reliable.
And it won't leak oil. Any problems... he will fix them at cost.
