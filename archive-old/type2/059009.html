Subject: Re: Oil Temp. Sender Install?

&gt;Can anyone direct me towards info on installing an Oil Temp. sender in a
&gt; '78 2.0L FI T4 engine?

VDO makes a sender specifically for type4 engines.  I got mine at CarCustom but I'm sure most VDO dealers will have it.  You drill a 1/2&quot; hole in what Bentley calls the 'oil pan cover.'  It's not the sump plate but the one held on with two bolts and has the funny oblong bump in the middle.  You have to drill this hole extremely accurately or it will leak profusely.  VDO includes a template with the sender but it still ain't easy.  I learned this the hard way!  Not only that, but that plate in not a part I just have spares lying around.  Mr. Schrecongost got some of my business that day, God bless him.  With the new plate and a correctly drilled hole, I put the sender in and snugged up the skinny little bolt on the inside.  With the hole in the right spot my sender has been leak free without any additional gunk.

While you are running a wire from your engine compartment to the dash, put in an extra one or two.  Who knows when you will want an oil pressure guage, tach, etc.  With the extra wire/s there, it sure makes it easy.

Good luck,
Clark
