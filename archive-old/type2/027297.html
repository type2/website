Subject: Torque on mixed back of head studs?

On 70ish 1600SP, on which I slew a head, the head studs are not all the 
same. Inner 4 are 10 MM. and outer ones are 8 MM. Do I torque them all to 
23, or do the smaller at 18 and larger at 23, OR all at 18? Does someone 
know..or can point me correctly in the archives?

Thanks, Marv Krupp
