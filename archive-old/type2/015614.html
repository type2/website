&gt;
&gt;Right.
&gt;
&gt;Scenario:
&gt;
&gt;My new, 1600DP, H30/31 carb, vacuum dizzy, alternator engine is still 
&gt;running hotter than I like when I get on the highway:  218-228 while 
&gt;cruising between 50-57 mph.  Timing is on, carb is adjusted (AFAICT).
&gt;All vacuum hoses are new, valves are adjusted.
&gt;
&gt;Things I have observed:
&gt;
&gt;- idle fluctuates +/- 25-50 rpm after warmed up

Sounds lean. Check your intake nuts for tight and runner seals/hoses.

&gt;
&gt;- inline fuel filter is consistently empty (is this indicative of
&gt;	anything, perhaps that there's an issue with the fuel pump?)

Verify pressure and volume from pump.

&gt;
&gt;- engine advances normally (roughly 20-28 degrees of total advance)
&gt;
&gt;- seemingly a little low on power, compared to previous engine running
&gt;	H30/31 Carb 


&gt;
&gt;Things I've tested:
&gt;
&gt;- i have sprayed wd40 on all the potential vacuum leak areas I can think of:
&gt;	- port/head connections
&gt;	- carb base
&gt;	- O-ring gaskets that connect the carb stand to the intake manifolds
&gt;		(is that terminology right?)
&gt;
&gt;	and have not seen/heard/felt a change in idle after dousing those
&gt;	areas with more WD40 than I can think of
&gt;
&gt;- bought a cheap-o vacuum gauge (just for testing) and connected
&gt;	it (with a t-connector) to:
&gt;		- vacuum advance port of the carb: &lt; 5 cm3 vacuum _at_ full throttle
&gt;		- vacuum retard port of the carb: &lt; 5 cm3 vacuum
&gt;
&gt;Thoughts:
&gt;
&gt;Hypothesis #1: 
&gt;
&gt;H30/31 is not the correct carb for the 1600DP and is too lean _at_50-57 mph, 
&gt;resulting in higher temperatures at speed. 

Like I said, sounds lean. Verify float level. Then reset mixture. 
 
&gt;
&gt;Likelyhood:  High
&gt;
&gt;The only thing keeping me from throwing my 34-Pict-3 back on right
&gt;away is that it seems like there's a loss of power that's not associated
&gt;with the carb ( previously had more power with the same carb, previous
engine)
&gt;and/or the fluctuating idle leads me to believe that I have other problems
&gt;to solve before i worry about the carb.

Compression test. Verify that always before ignition or fuel systems, just
to be sure.

&gt;
&gt;Hypothesis #2:
&gt;
&gt;Fuel Pump not pushing enough fuel and the engine is running lean as a result.

Verify pressure and volume, but I already said that.

&gt;
&gt;Likelyhood: Medium
&gt;
&gt;I don't think the fuel filter being &quot;empty&quot; while the engine is running is
&gt;really indicative of anything, but everytime I look at it, I wonder...
&gt;Is this indicative of anything?

Not necessarily, but verify volume and pressure, then float level. Did this
carb come off a 1300?? Verify jet sizes while your in there verifying the
float level.

&gt;
&gt;Hypothesis #3:
&gt;
&gt;I have a vacuum leak somewhere.
&gt;
&gt;Likelyhood: Highest
&gt;
&gt;I really figure the fluctuating idle means i have an idle leak
&gt;somewhere, but the only hose i haven't replaced (and which i should be
&gt;replacing this weekend) is the last 1' booster hose (between the metal
&gt;tubing and the brake booster itself).

Just a lean idle mix can cause this symtom, but rule out air leaks before
the fuel system is ruled guilty.

This could even be as simple as just adjusting richer. Does standard
mixture adjustment respond properly. Idle drops when turned in and rises
when turned out??? Turn the mixture screw out half a turn and see if things
cool down and power comes back.
