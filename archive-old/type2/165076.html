Subject: Re: [T2] tires/speedo

I also have 185R14 Hancook RA-08 tires.  I could have sworn that my
speedometer  read fast, so I took the GPS with me to work today.  The
result is kind of interesting.

At lower speeds (around 30mph), the speedometer is relatively
accurate, if anything it reads low.  40km/h was 40km/h, 50km/h was
actually 53km/h, 60 km/h was actually 62 km/h.

At highway speeds, it starts to go off the other way.  100km/h was
actually 95km/h, 110 km/h was actually 103km/h.  That matched what I
remembered, that the speedometer read fast.

Moral of the story, if you run stock tires 185/R14, the speedo is
accurate.  I'm running Hancook
