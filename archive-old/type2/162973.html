Subject: Re: [T2] Blowing Blue

&gt;From experience with Chev v/8s, the first puff of blue was an indicator that
&gt;something in the valve stem &quot;sealing&quot; system was worn, and when motor was off,
&gt;fluid crept down valve shaft to burn at next ignition phase, and escape out
&gt;the tailpipe. FFT

	Sure Sid; but how much does it matter?  I reckon that, if 
anything, it's good (so long as it doesn't foul the plugs).
