Earlier buses, perhaps up to '59 or '60 (opening myself up for
a numeric attack form Clara) had cloth headliners.  It was kind
of a soft, slightly fuzzy kind of material.  I've been told
its supposed to be mohair, but I haven't been able to substantiate
that.  Its the same type of material that you'll find in early
bugs; I've seen it as late as an all original '60 at Vallejo.
