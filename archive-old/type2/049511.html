Subject: [T2] Re:  [VB] to repair original upholstry seams?

h e w r o t e :

It is time to put the seats back in the '67. The upper part of the rearmost

seat has split at the seam between the  the front where your back rests and

the top (sides). A better way to explain this might be that the mesh part

has seperated from the solid colored part at the piping.. Upon examing this

it appears that the thread has simply crumbled into oblivian. The seat

material is not in the greatest of condition but is usuable.

=  == = = = = 
 The horsehair should survive.   I would remove the covers, turn them outside 
in, and by had sew them with upholstery thread approxomating the originally 
use colour.  resew through the holes already there.   Also soak seat covrs 
with glycerin, it revitalised that real vinyl leatherette.   
If it ripped the material by the seams rather than just the threads breaking, 
its a little trickier.

Grease, roofing tar and glycerin- the three food groups -  your bus will love 
you for them.
