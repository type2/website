Subject: Re: [T2] What gives???

&gt; Last week I went to fill the gas tank on my 1973 bus, (the gauge showed
empty) when lo and behold, the tank filled with only 8.5 gallons!! When I came
back from the cashier with the change, there was a MAJOR gas &quot;waterfall&quot; on
the left side of the engine!!! The filling is done on the right side of the
bus, but the leak was on the left side!!! Did anyone have this happen to them
before??

First off stop driving the bus.  The part that is leaking is part of the
venting system.  Reach up on the drivers side beside the engine up into the
vent towards the top of the bus.  If you can't feel it go higher it is a good
reach up. There will be two metal tubes up there connected by a very short
rubber fuel line (about 3 inches). The rubber line is falling apart I bet.
Just remove the rubber line and replace with a new line available at your
flaps.

This happened to me also.  Not many people even know this line is up there but
it is the usual culprit for driver side gas leaks.

PLEASE every one else, check this line if you never have.  Odds are if you
haven't changed it, no one else has either.

Peace Brother,
