The top on &quot;Itch&quot; is the normal Westfalia top. It is the same as every other
68-73 Top I have ever seen. Are you sure you have a Westfalia and not
another conversion? There were several camper companies making top during
the 60s and 70s, yours could be a replacement or one of those other brands
of camper. Send pictures if you can and we will take a look.

I was looking at these pix of listmember Mike's &quot;Itch,&quot; a '69 CA Westy:

My '68 CA Westy has a different shape lid.  Mine is smooth with no step half
way up the side and no ribs.  Do I have an odd-ball?  Is Itch's top a
replacement?  Did Westfalia change the lid in '69?  Inquiring minds want to
know.
