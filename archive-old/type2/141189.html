Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Depot doesn't carry it but I need it!

I just came across this thread on the Bentley site:
http://tech.bentleypublishers_dot_com/thread.jspa?forumID=89&amp;threadID=4622&amp;messa
geID=16914#16914

I seem to remember that the original poster to our thread mentioned that his
tranny was leaking out of the cover for the second gear brake piston. The
Bentley thread suggests that this may be a tricky leak to fix to due
alignment issues - scroll towards the end of the Bentley thread.
