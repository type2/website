Whoa whoa whoa!

Do I see that in the UK they have German Heat Exchangers for US$165 a pair?
I thought these were NLA.

I'm in for 2 pairs if we want to do a group import purchase.  Anyone know
how we can get these in the USA for US$200 pair with shipping?

  Who hates rusty heat exchangers, and all of them here in the PNW are this
way!

Several of the British have proudly informed me that the pound is BIGGER
than the dollar so these carbs are more like $165. I thought maybe I
smelled blood there for a minute but never mind. 8)
