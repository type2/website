X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

Being 18 and fairly imature i dont know why i disagree here. They should have 
the bus for a year driveing around town. It took me 6 months of working on my 
bus to get an understanding of how it works, now when im on a trip i know 
what tools to carry, i feel confident that i can handle all but the most 
serious problems. I.E. my clutch going. I just took my bus back to the 
origional owner, He said he never replaced it, my clutch made it 100k miles.

 I would say you need to allow for at least 2 to 4 weeks running the car
 around town before sending them off. You have to realise that with older
 cars problems can always occur so make sure these kids know what to do in
 case of a breakdown. In these circumstances a working mobile phone is
 probably the most important 'gadget'.
