Subject: do we have low milage engines?
Mime-Version: 1.0

Quoth Harmon Seaver:
 &quot;VW's are a high wear, low milage engine compared to water
coolers. They run hotter, therefore rings wear quicker.&quot;
   My 78 Westy has 197,600mi on its stock never rebuilt engine- 138lbs
average compression; oil squirted in brings compression over 160.  Passes
NJ inspection and gets 20mpg....It's possible that the TUFOIL (a friction
reducer) I used since I got the bus (60K on it) was a factor?  I know of
one owner who got 206K before wobbling a rod.  I'm curious as to take a
poll of the maximum milage you've had an engine go for.  The 64 beetle I
sold to a friend went 135K before blowing- but then it didn't have an oil
filter and had about 90-100 lbs when I sold it!
