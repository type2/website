&gt;     &quot;Oktan min. 91 ROZ/RON&quot;
&gt;
&gt;The minimum rating applies to stock compression ratios.
&gt;
&gt;Offered for information, not to add fuel to the fire.

Someone else put a better explanation on the list. I think I mixed up the

US ratings are different and 91 European is equivalent to 87 US.
