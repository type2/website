Subject: 75 Bug Hood Vent

HI listees
This is an FYI for those of you who need it:

We have been dealing with a wet floor in our 75 bug for years now and never 
got around to fixing the problem.  Well we went a replaced the antenna 
figuring that the water was leaking through there into the hood, then into 
the bug.  So we fixed that and it stopped it slightly.  but then we would 
pull the mats up periodically and there would be water.  Well finally this 
weekend we decided to go at it again.  Well there is that vent in the hood.  
There is supposed to be a black container with a rubber seal and a hose 
attaches to that and you run it outside the vehicle.  Then the rain goes 
into the black container through the tube and outside the car.  not in the 
passenger compartment floor.

Just wanted to let you know for those who are missing that container.

Nothin left to do but smile, smile, smile!!
