Subject: RE: [T2] Bricks, Vandels, and a Clutch...

&gt;From: &quot;daniel nelson&quot;

&gt;Some punk kids threw a brick against my poor helpless 82 Westy with orginal 
&gt;paint in good shape. People keep saying it's good they didn't get a window, 
&gt;but I wish they did get a window instead, that would be an easy cheap fix, 
&gt;now I have to figure out how to save my paint and such. What's the best 
&gt;thing to do with it now, I want to stop the orginal paint from flaking 
&gt;anymore. Can a body man pop this out or do I only have the bondo *shudders* 
&gt;option. My westy isn't pristine or anything but it's all orginal metal and 
&gt;paint and there are only 3 microscopic rust spots on the body.

Sorry to hear it, that really sucks. Before I got mine some punk kids had 
gotten to it with rocks. They got windows and body panels.

&gt;Next, I'm going to have my mechanic fix my engine problems. (Yea I know I 
&gt;could do it myself but I don't really have the time or know how to drop a 
&gt;Type 4 engine and I'm a Type 1 sissy). First I'm going to do a compression 
&gt;check and hopefully that is good and then I'm going to replace the oil 
&gt;cooler, oil cooler seal, push rod tube seals, rear seal. What else can I do 
&gt;at the same time.

That is a good start. I can say that I used to be a sissy, too. It really is 
not that hard. I use my same jack and stands.

http://homepage.mac_dot_com/ratwell/EngineRemoval.html this is for earlier 
models but same basic principles.

Your poor '82 needs some TLC. Take a day to get to know her. Even if you 
drop the engine take a peak and some pics of the clutch, etc. Then just 
throw it back in and let your mech. do it again later. Then you will have 
gained a little experience, seen your clutch, spent some quality time with 
your bus and most of all you will not be a &quot;sissy&quot; anymore.

&gt;I really want to save the money up to fix everything it needs when I drop 
&gt;the engine even though I plan on selling it. I want to do it right and 
&gt;welcome any suggestions on what needs to be done. I really don't want to 
&gt;shell out bucks for rebuilt heads though if I don't have to.

If you are going to sell it do it yourself.

&gt;PS: Thanks to all that helped with my injector questions, I will have them 
&gt;rebuilt as soon as I get the engine 100%.

Good Luck and don't be a &quot;S.I.S.S.Y.&quot; Seriously Inexperienced Scared 
Shitless Youngin&quot;
