But does this really seal to the door frame?  You're right, this does
protect the panel very nicely.  Maybe that's all that's required?  Will
heavy rain still get inside the cabin between the panel and the door since
it's only those little clips that are holding the plastic to the door frame?
I thought the vapor barrier was glued to the door frame and then the panel
clips to the door frame.

&gt; Hi there, I just used clear plastic laid it on the backside of my door
&gt; panel and
&gt; trimmed it out with an exacto knife, used a glue stick to glue it up and
&gt; oula vapor barrier :-)
