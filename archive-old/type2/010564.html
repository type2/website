Subject: Why does my bus pull to the right?
Message-ID: &lt;19991108230050.87715.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

Hello people,

I've noticed that my '76 bus pulls to the right a little bit as I drive.  If 
I let go of the wheel it will veer right. To keep it straight the position 
of the steering wheel that should be at 12 o'clock is at around 11 o'clock.  
My tire are wearing unevenly of course.  What to do?  I read up that you can 
adjust toe in and camber.  What should I do? How do I do it?

Thanks,

Jeffrey
