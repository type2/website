Subject: RE: [T2] &quot;They Said You Were Hung!&quot; (Front Axle Beam Installation Update)

Thanks, Steven, for the update, and for being the first to try one of these
new beams!

I have five available at this point, at the special price of $299.95.  Part
# 211 401 061N .  These include new bearings and are genuine VW stock -
identical to the one Steven installed.  They were about $1200 when last
available about 20 years ago.

I have 12 more, but a buyer in Europe has expressed interest in taking all
12 at an even higher price.  (Actually, he wanted all I had, but I do want
to keep some for listmembers and US buyers, rather than selling all of them
to someone who will certainly jack the price up dramatically, particularly
after covering transatlantic shipping costs plus his own profit margins.)
If he does indeed follow through (which I don't consider a definate until I
have the $$$ in my hot little hands :-), the remaining 12 will go to Europe,
leaving only the original 5 for sale to listmembers.

There will be no more where theyse came from, as near as I can tell.  This
was a very lucky N.O.S. find, and these beams have been discontinued for the
better part of 20 years.  For that long, nobody (including myself) could
find new beams anywhere, until I lucked into this source and took all they
had.  I would love to find more, but I'm not estimating my chances as being
very good at all.

Do yourself a favor and go look at your front axle beam in the morning.
You're crazy not to.  As many of you know, this is a weak point on the Bus,
so you may be surprised at what you find.  If yours has signs of rust, this
is very possibly your only chance to get a brand new beam (as opposed to a
junkyard beam with 25 years of wear and tear).  These are an absolute steal
at $299 (which is a listmember promo; regular price to be $349).  If I were
the greedy sort I'd price them at twice that, bide my time, and still
eventually sell them all, as when you need one, you need one, and I've got a
monopoly on these.  Supply and demand, you know.  But my policy is that I
pretty much work at a fixed markup, so my retail prices are directly tied to
wholesale cost.  In this case, the wholesale supplier frankly let them go
for much less than he could have, so I'm passing it on. I only wish he'd had
more.

Toll-Free for Orders by Part #    1-866-BUS-DEPOT



&gt; And they were right!!!! :-)  A while back, Ron posted that Bus Depot
&gt; (www.busdepot_dot_com) was now carrying new front axle beams.  I ordered one
&gt; of them in late December since the beam on the '73 was showing rust at a
&gt; couple spots and I was worried about it.  Well, finally this weekend it
&gt; was warm enough and I was free so I have spent the weekend removing the
&gt; old beam and installing the new one.  The process has gone more slowly
&gt; than ever before, as (a) this is the first time I have attempted to do
&gt; this alone and (b) I have stopped every couple minutes to take a picture.
&gt;
&gt; The good and very pertinent news is that the new beam is on and it fits
&gt; damn near perfectly!!!!  It is a hair wider than the frame and will need a
&gt; shim or so, but that is fine and not totally unexpected.  Bentley, in the
&gt; section on front axle beam replacement, says,
&gt;
&gt;          &quot;NOTE ----
&gt;           If there is a gap between the axle end plates
&gt;           and the frame sidemembers, take up the gap
&gt;           with spacers, which are available in thick-
&gt;           nesses of 0.50 and 1.00 mm (.020 and .040
&gt;           in.)&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Apparently VW expected this and it is not a problem. Actually, in a
&gt; replacement, I would far rather that the beam was made to the widest
&gt; tolerances, as the frames apparently are allowed to vary a bit and having
&gt; a beam that is too narrow would be very bad.  More important is that the
&gt; bolt pattern and spacing were spot on.  The welding and finish look good.
&gt; I am very happy!
&gt;
&gt; This beam is installed on a '73 and is the second beam I have put on this
&gt; bus. The donor for the old beam was a '79, so I feel confident saying that
&gt; Ron's new beams *will* fit buses from '73-79.  I thing they will go back a
&gt; couple years as well, but I know the bolt pattern changes a couple years
&gt; before my bus.  In '71 or '72?
&gt;
&gt; I have put copies of the raw pictures I took (all 153 of them!) at:
&gt;
&gt; http://www.everybus_dot_com/dworkin/axle_beam/index.htm
&gt;
&gt; I will be playing with them and writing text to go with them (and
&gt; deleting the really fuzzy and duplicative ones :)  But I want everyone to
&gt; see the last one right away!
&gt;
&gt; http://www.everybus_dot_com/dworkin/axle_beam/pages/P1270013.htm
&gt;
&gt; Isn't it *pretty*??? :-)  I am *so* happy!!!! (did I say that already?
&gt; Well, I am :-)
&gt;
&gt; On &quot;going it alone&quot;, well, it is *possible* but I would never do it this
&gt; way again if I had any choice.  The beam is not super heavy, but it is in
&gt; the neighborhood of 75 pounds, even stripped to the bone and the position
&gt; is *very awkward.  But I did manage it and didn't damage anything, even
&gt; me! :-)
