Subject: How do I put South African Big Brakes on an 80 Vanagon

Apart from the obvious 15&quot; wheels, does anyone know what you 
need in order to fit the SA Big Brake kit to a 1980 Westy?

The 2WD SA kits include:
2 vented rotors
2 replacement hubs
l&amp;r complete calipers
2 brake hoses
4 3.5mm spacer washers (3.5 mm thick) to position calipers
2 metal brake pipe extensions (to locate hoses behind the 
strut). 

For 1986 to 1991 2WDs you only have to replace your wheel's 
hub plus wheel lugnuts (to fit over the studs in the new 
hub). Is there more to a pre-86 instalation? Has anyone done 
this on an 80? 

Thanks,
Chris
