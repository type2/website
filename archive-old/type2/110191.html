Subject: moody fuel injection

Hello,  My engine has been running rich and overall badly (speeding up and 
slowing down, almost dying and then coming back up).  Checked all vacuum lines.  
Next we checked the fuel system:

       We tested for voltage on the fuel injection wires, and we didn't get 
any voltage, only on one injection wire. Thats a problem.  So we did some 
tests.       

       We tested for continuity in the wiring harness from the Control Unit 
to the injecters, and thats okay.
       We jumped the injecters, they are all working fine.       
       We did Bentley's electrical test on the double relay and it checked 
out fine.
       During this we cleaned and wire brushed the double relay, the ECU, the 
fuel injecters, etc.
       
But get this:  Afterwards we tested for voltage again and we got voltage on 
all four fuel injection wires!!!

Put everything back together, did THE SAME TEST and only got voltage on one 
of the four wires.  Weird.

Turned the engine over, same ol' thing, fuel in the exhaust, etc.  So we 
unplugged one by one each fuel injection wire, and we found that nothing in the 
idle changed.  All fuel injecters were unplugged and it was still running.  Then 
we plugged them back in and it started to run much better cleaner and faster. 
 So the injecters must be getting voltage.  Weird.

Anybody have any clue as to why the fuel injecters sometimes get voltage, 
other times don't?  From experience, is it a problem with the Control Unit (ECU), 
or the double relay (which we tested already and worked)?  Any other tests I 
should do or things I need to consider?

Fondly,
Kevin
