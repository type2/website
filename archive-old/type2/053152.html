this is the picture and here is the description
     this bus is a workhorse, its runs great. the rebuilt has 40k. the interior was all redone by the previous owner &amp; all the cabinetry is mint, very clean for a '72. the dual carbs have been replaced by a weber
progressive carb. i am the 3rd owner. originally from arizona, this bus has never seen snow, i store it every winter as did the previous owner. in the spring/summer it is my daily driver. i have receipts for all the mechanical work and the original owners manual. Has new brakes/tires &amp; brand new cv joints. the pop-top is a ASI/Riviera, pops straight up. (pretty rare) i replaced the screens on the pop-top. the exterior color was repainted by the previous owner in a dull metallic green color. the only rust is a small area under the windshield (typical bus rust area).

How much is this car worth? Please help me
