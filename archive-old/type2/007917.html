Subject: Strange Conversion Idea...
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

OK... before everyone thinks i'm nuts.....  The Bus isn't ever going
to be usable as a bus again!

After *smacking* a doe with the front end (along with all the other
body work the P.O. neglected...) I'm considering converting the '77
Bus into a drag behind camper after gutting it.

My plans call for using the engine compartment as a generator/battery
hold, keeping the fuel tank and elect. fuel pump to carry spare fuel,
placing a &quot;chuck-wagon&quot; type kitchen inside the back hatch with a
console for TV/stereo/etc. behind the 'kitchen' on the ledge above the
engine compartment facing the inside of the bus.

I'm thinking of cutting the body at the post behind the drivers
compartment (cab) and adding a new sheetmetal 'nose'.  

Now that I've divulged my evil plan......  Any ideas about how to add
the tow-tongue?  What about brakes? etc...  I've never attempted
anything like this before, but, what the hey!

Let me know if you have any ideas.....

Rev. Dave
'77 Bus - for now...
'79 Bus - soon to be drivable
