Lucky dog!  Brand new type 2! Drool, Drool!

My '71 has a towing eye on the right hand bumper guard, but I wouldn't
trust it for anything but light-duty use.

For heavy towing, I would tie to the lower right hand tube of the
front beam, as close as the frame attachement as possible

But, your bus is RHD, correct?  In that case you'd want to tie to the
left hand side of the beam.  In any case, make sure that the tow rope
won't interfere with steering or brake components.
