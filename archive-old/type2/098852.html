Subject: Pictures of my refurbished engine compartment and my rebuilt
  914 engine

Hello List,

The subject says it all. I finilly got the computer to
work with my digital camera again and I uploaded the
pics. that I took of my 914 engine and engine
compartment. Since these were taken, I have installed
the engine but I still have several things to hook up
before it will run. Anyway, here is the link.

Please let me know if this link is bad. It should work
but I am notorious for giving out bad links. This is
how the POR 15 whitecote turned out in the engine
compartment. My bigest problem with it was I used
POR15 black as a base coat so I had to use several
coats of the Whitecote to cover it! It is hard as a
rock and definitely waterproof!!! Yes, the exterior of
my bus is covered with primer and unfinished body
work. It is quite ulgy right now but it does not have
much rust at all now. I guess you could call it
Volknstein's Monster. (pun intended)
 
Oh well,
  Have a great day!

David Kelly
