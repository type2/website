Subject: RE: [T2] Shredded Westy Canvas - How to replace?

Yeah, I need to do that too...last major step in my
refresh project. Based on the effort required to
remove the old one, I think a couple hours and a good
staple gun would suffice.  A helper would probably be
good, but I suspect you could probably use a few
staples and 2x4's to hold things up during assembly.


I had heard that the vanagon tent is slightly larger
and much easier to fit...anyone have experience with
this?

Thanks,  

Rick
