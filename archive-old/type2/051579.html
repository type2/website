Subject: [T2] Vanagon fan

Last week my wife informed me that the fan in the 82 Westy was u/s.  &quot;No
problem&quot; I replied.  &quot;You only need it when you run the furnace, and you're
afraid of it and I'm too cheap to use it, so who cares?&quot;  Well, it turns
out she cares, so I went out and tried it.  Worked fine.  Two days later
she complained that it wasn't working.  Tried it again.  It wasn't.  This
week I'm driving the van and it works fine.  Any guesses?

Ian Cameron in Victoria where it never gets cold enough to need the furnace.
