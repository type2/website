Drew,

It's a TDC sensor, supposedely used for electronic shop test equipment.  I
don't know how usefull it is.  You can drive it out towards the flywheel.

When I was manteling my AVP rebuilt engine, I broke the plastic part of my
TDC sensor while trying to get it out of the old engine, so I didn't
reinstall it on the rebuilt engine.  I stuck a plug into the hole to keep
crap away from my clutch and flywheel.  I used a 1/2&quot; (I think) copper pipe
cap.

Good luck,

Ray
