Subject: Re: [T2] FI fuel pump options?


You need the correct fuel pump fo FI. Pressure is critical. $200 is
probably not too far from what you may have to pay. Now if you are running
the single carb you dont need tha much fuel PSI and can use any aftermarket
pump that delivers 2-3 PSI.

I've installed my used 2.0 liter FI engine in my 79, the PO had a 1700
single carb in it.  I need to get
a new fuel pump for the FI, my FLAPS can get one but it's $200.  Is there
any other fuel pump available at a reasonable price that will work?  Seems
like a lot for a fuel pump, but I'll pay it if I must.

Thanks,

Rob
