Subject: Stickers on VW as Probable Cause, Part 2

There was a thread on the list (I hope - or was it the Vanagon 
list?) a couple of weeks ago, about whether Grateful Dead or other 
stickers on the back of a bus are sufficient to get your VW pulled 
over and/or searched.

Today, a friend of mine had an interesting experience that relates 
to this.  She was having her Splittie transported from Sacramento 
to New Jersey, where she had moved.  When the car hauler carrying 
her bus stopped at a weigh station in Nebraska, a Department of 
Transportation officer noticed a bumper sticker on the back of the 
bus that referred to pot.  The D.O.T. used this sticker as probable 
cause to pry open her bus (while on the car carrier) and tear it 
apart looking for drugs (which they did not find).  She will 
receive her bus on Thursday and then will know the extent of the 
damage.  The D.O.T. has not ruled out the possibility of 
reimbursing her for the damages, but this may have to do with the 
fact that her stepmother, an FBI agent, put an angry call into the 
D.O.T. office.  According to her stepmother, stickers that in any 
way refer to or depict illegal drugs may be considered probable 
cause for a search in some states.
