&lt;&lt;Hey all,
I by pure accident found a way to get my dingy grey/brown mottled with
mold pop top bright white without chemicals and little effort!  On my
trip back from MN to Atlanta, I stopped at one of those self service car
washes. The reason was to spray the mass of dead bugs off the front of
the bus before we got back into the high heat of the south.  After
getting the bugs off and washing down the sides I aimed the spray wand
at the pop top. And much to my surprise it created a nice white strip
where I had sprayed.  &gt;&gt;

Yes this will clean your top to brilliant white, but it can also damage it as
well.  The high pressure water can eat away at the fiberglass.  I have a few
gouges in my top from where I pressure washed it.  I still do on occasionally
spray my top off, but I no longer get that wand right up on the top.
