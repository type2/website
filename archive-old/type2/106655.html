Well, you're not COMPLETELY in the clear.  The pressurized system 
(pressurized meaning bilge blower before h-xgr) is still probably at a 
lower pressure than your exhaust coming out of the head, so if there's an 
exhaust leak, you still may get some leakage into your heater air -- just 
not nearly as much.
