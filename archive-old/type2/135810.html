Subject: Re: Yet another tire thread... Kelly Pathfinder Tires?

Ok, I went ahead and bought them. The guy at the shop who recommended
them said they're load range C.

Kelly Pathfinder AP's in my size are NOT load range C. They *are* LT
tires however. But the load rating is 95Q. 2 ply sidewalls.

Of course I didn't notice until I got back to the office and really looked. 

However, they are WAY stiffer than the tires that were on there. One
was a C rated tire but old and bald. The other was a crappy no-name
passenger tire. The handling of the bus did suffer because of them.
The improvement with these tires was huge.

I'm going to go ahead and run them to Colorado, taking it easy on
curves and turns. (I was going to do that anyway, so it's all good!)
If I notice any mushing out I'm stopping at the first Discount Tire
(or America's Tire... same place) and making them swap them out.

The price of $95 installed was pretty reasonable though. And the tread
is reasonably aggressive... Appears good for light snow use. I'll let
ya'll know...
