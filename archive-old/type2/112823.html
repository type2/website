&gt; K so to recap Either way i turn my turn signal switch both sides of 
&gt; the extorior lights blink at the same time instead of just the left or 
&gt; just the right.  There were 2 wires previously cut off, when i 
&gt; recieved the bus, a brown which i traced back to a bolt in the back, 
&gt; obviously a ground.  and a brown and white which goes back to the E 
&gt; flasher relay. Whenever i try to connect either one, and then turn on 
&gt; the turn signal a fuse blows. All the connections have been cleaned, 
&gt; and i traced all the wires and they seem to be where they need to be. 
&gt; Also right under the front of the bus all the wires that go to the 
&gt; back of the bus have been hand reconnected, looking like someone tried 
&gt; to replace the switch before and had to cut and splice the wires back 
&gt; together, and I double checked that that section was connected right. 
&gt; So please I want to get this street legal ASAP help me!
&gt;

what I think happened here is your p.o. rewired the lights wrong.  keep 
in mind your turn signal lights serve two functions 1.  parking light 
(when head lights are on) 2.  blinking.  A grey wire should connect 
those lights.  make sure they're not wired into any of your black/colred 
wires down there.

also it seems like a good a good idea  to rule out the turn signal 
switch and a volt/ohmmeter will be necassary. if you don't have one get 
one.  cheap from radio shack.  take off the surn signal switch to where 
you can see all the wires and where they're held down.  the black/white 
wire is the left blinker and the black/green is the right, black/yellow 
is left rear and black/red is right rear .  we know that the left and 
right should act independetly of eachother (other except when flasher 
switch is on).  with the car off test the for continuity between left 
wires and right wires when the switch is flipped on.  try it again  by 
removing those wires from the fuse panel.  if there is than the switch 
is faulty.

see if this gets you anywhere.
