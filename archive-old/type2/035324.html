Subject: Re: Starter.

Dan, we had same experience, my dad's got a 73 bus.  The &quot;shorter circuit&quot; or
solenoid booster method that is so successful on old 6-volt cars was working for
a two years, then went unreliable and finally quit.  I resisted the need to
replace the starter until I convinced myself there was no other way, no weakness
in the current supply.  When we replaced the starter, we found the only available
new replacement part for the 73 starter (and likely the 74) was very different
looking, it was redesigned and doesn't even use the bushing in the trans as
support for the starter pinion shaft anymore.  When you replace your starter
(just check those battery cables one more time to be sure, boost it with another
car and booster cables to convince yourself there's no hope it's only a weak
battery connection), be sure to get a new redesigned new one instead of a used or
rebuilt old design.
Our original starter just failed last year, you seem to have the same age for
this being the failed part.  Meanwhile, I've never had to replace a starter for
failure of this kind in my pre-72 vw's, there the booster circuit makes them last
much longer.  PS the key in the dash was already replaced by a PO in our bus and
we knew that was ok when it clicked the booster relay we wired in, and gave a
good circuit to the failed starter solenoid).

&gt; I have a not so new problem.  I have a 74 bus and the switch at the key
&gt; quit working to engage the starter.  I di all the usuall tests and
&gt; comfirmed that the key switch was indeed my problem.  Next I hooked up a
&gt; starter button from the battery to the button and then to the statrte
&gt; seliond.(bad spelling).  It works about 87% of th etime.  The other times I
&gt; get a small click from the starter.  The dash lights dim like it pulling
&gt; juice but the starter does not engage.
