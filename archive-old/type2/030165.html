Christopher,

Yes, you can get to the oil cooler with the engine in the vanagon, but, 
no, it isn't a whole lot of fun :-( You need to remove the fan shroud,
which means removing the tin behind the engine, the alternator, the oil
fill tube (at the block), the fan, and then the shroud.

Before you go to all that trouble, tho... check you oil pressure sender!
They do spring leaks, they do drip in the same spot, and they are much 
easier to replace.  Cheaper too!
