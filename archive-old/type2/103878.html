Subject: Re: [T2] Propane stuff and tips

I agree that a carbon monoxide alarm is a smart thing to have if you are
heating your bus for comfort using propane. I have one that is attached to
the burner cover so it stays with the heater.

As far as horror stories of people badly burned go.... you can bet I've seen
some nasty things happen to people. I've treated  people burned badly from
gasoline, propane and kerosene as well as wood fires. I've had to intubate
and ventilate a fully conscious man who was squirting gas into his
carburator to get his vehicle going.... backfired into his face and burned
his entire upper body (he was wearing no shirt). Stuff happens. We all make
our decisions and live with the consequences.

Sometimes people get injured because of some bad decision they made...
sometimes it's just bad luck. In my medical practice I don't concern myself
with that. The outcome is the same regardless of whether &quot;it was his/her own
fault&quot; or not and I just do what I can to help.

Interestingly, I have never seen a case of carbon monoxide poisoning brought
in to the ER in this rural town that is popular as a camping area. I suspect
it's because they don't bother to bring in people found dead; they just call
the coronor and take them to the morgue or funeral home.
