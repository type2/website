Subject: Re: [T2] No compression, weird valve

Dave
1st, you don't have to remove the engine to remove a head. Remove the tin 
from the affected side, along with the intake stuff, and the head will come 
out...its a tight fit, but have done it several times.  Check out closely the 
valve seat and guide.
