   I've been getting some weirdness in my brakes lately that I can't
quite figure out. Maybe my servo is dying. My pads and rear shoes are
good, and I don't think that the brake servo hose is leaking, or my FI
would do the &quot;too lean&quot; thing. Anyway, what happens is that sometimes
the brake pedal gets really hard, like it is when you disconnect the
servo vacuum hose. Maybe not quite that bad, but definitely different
feeling than normal. Then other days, it's normal again.
