Greetings list -

I just wanted to say &quot;hey&quot;. I've been in digest mode for a while - ever
since the email went down and the SysAdmin at work had to manually
distribute everybody's email (all 200 of mine from the type2 list alone!).

The Bus Names list is still up, growing very slowly now. I think we have
captured every bus name on mother earth. I've even seen links to it here and
there. Thanks!

Itch is running great. I *almost* got up the northbound Grapevine (CA folks
know what this hill is) in fourth with a full camping load and gas tank. Had
to shift to 3rd once to make it past the air pocket a semi created. Got back
up the southbound side in 4th gear all the way. Yahoo!

Anyway. I'm still with you in the shadows, reading and learning. See y'all
later.
