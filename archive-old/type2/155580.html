Subject: Got a lot done today...

Fixed the oil leak I caused when I did my valves (reusing the gaskets 3
times was once too many it seems... heh.)
Took an old rubber cargo mat and cut it to fit in the back deck over the
engine.
Took the splash pan off and inspected for rust (it's fine).
Lubed the throttle and brake linkage hidden under there.
Found my new fuel filter wasn't jacked after all. I had set the dwell waaaay
too low Friday (it was at 30*! Now it's at 45. Close enough...)
Pulled off the sliding door covers (whatever they're called... Under the
rear windows.) Hit the rust with a wire wheel, then sanded it. Sprayed them
with crappy rustoleum primer with a HorribleFreight HVLP gun. (HF Item
number 91772. $50, no compressor needed. Works great!)
Greased up the sliding door in all the channels. Much smoother and quieter.
Inspected the nylon blocks too. Looking good.
Inspected the metal under the rear windows with those rusty covers gone. No
rust! How did the rust only get to the covers?

Tomorrow I'll sand the primer and paint with white rustoleum (notice a
trend?) I'm using crap paint for $$ reasons. But I don't want the rust to
get any worse. When I can afford real paint I'll strip them down to the
metal...
