I've been waiting two months for that 100 degree day to work on the ongoing
'72 camper project. This morning I removed the side window and quarter light
&gt;from the drivers side and prepped the frame with some POR 15. Retrived the
Jals from the parts room and took a good look at them. I bought these from
another listee and although they looked like they had been stored at the
bottom of a damp compost heap they cleaned up with some soap and water on
the glass and some 0000 steel wool on the frames. I would say they almost
look spiffy! 

I grabbed the new seals that I bought from Bus Depot (not sure of the real
origon) and fitted them on the frame. The fit was a bit loose. I went to do
a dry fit before I got out the drill to do the holes ( these are going where
no jalousie has gone before.) Damn, they wont fit. I took the seal off and
dry fitted the window in the bus. It was tight but allowed a small anount of
room to accomidate the seal. I carefully put the seal back on. Did a quick
self check for signs of heat stroke and took another stab at it. It went in
a little better but the seal rolled of the sides. More cursing. 

At this point I am stuck. Either I am doing this incorrectly (fair chance)
or the seal is making life tough. Seemed easier to bang the windsheild in
the do these Jals. Even thoigh the seal does not seat around the frame
should I use a cord on the slot that is thereto help set it in the frame?
Could the heat have caused some expansion in the Jals? Is this really harder
than it looks? I thought drilling the holes was gonna be the real problem
not installing the window. Any advice at this point is welcomed!!
