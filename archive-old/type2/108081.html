&gt; &gt;From what I can tell you, they use the exact same window seal that the SOLID piece of glass window would

&gt; From what I've read, NO bus was ever sold (in North America at least) that didn't have some type of window
opening in the middle section.
 There were no solid glass middle windows.
If you're talking about the back windows, they are a completely different shape, so no go there.

Sorry Billy, I have seen more than a handful of USA buses with solid middle side glass. Part # 221 845 301A [I
believe]. I even have two pieces of the original glass.....waiting for the person that wants to do away with
the vent windows..... shipping may be prohibitive however.
