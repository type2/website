Sean,

If it's been a while since you changed your
fuel-filter, I'd start there. What you describe is a
classic sign of a clogged filter.

Otherwise, I'd say the usual.....points, condenser,
rotor, plugs/wires, coil, even fuel pump.

If you had a single carb, I'd suggest you *might* have
some crud in it....but I'd check the others first.

My money says fuel filter, though. If you live where
they &quot;oxygenate&quot; fuel (by adding ethanol) during the
winter months, fuel filters clog *very* quickly....
The ethanol acts as an emmulsifier between gasoline
and water; combining the two dissimilar substances
into one. 

That means that all the condensation in the bottom of
your tank (as well as at the gas station) is picking
up all the crud from the bottom, and trying to shove
it through your fuel system. If you use paper filters,
this can be especially troublesome; when the paper
comes into contact with water, it expands and cuts off
the flow (as it is designed to to).


Good luck!
