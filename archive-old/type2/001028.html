Subject: Blue Wire (again)

As I mentioned I just replaced my alternator in my '78 Bus. It worked well
for the year I've owned the Bus and charged my battery fine, till the
bearing went out yesterday.  Thanks to members on the list I was told to
connect the blue wire to the D+ connector in the regulator.

Problem is the regulator has only room for the 3 prong connector , the wires
are green, red and brown. The red wire is going to the D+ connector.

Because my dash board light for the alternator doesn't work I ASSUMED it was
this blue wire that has been cut (It comes from the wire cluster on the
pass. side engine compartment). When I had my dash apart I saw the
alternator light was blue as well. That's how I made the assumption. Is this
blue wire responsible for my dash light? I should mention that all FI system
is gone and I'm running with a Weber.

Even if you don't know, I'd appreciate members with '78 Busses to go out and
look in their engine compartments. On the right side there are 2 holes for
wires, one is the + battery lead to the starter and the other a wire cluster
that has a blue wire in it.  Mine has been cut. Where does yours go?
Thanks,
