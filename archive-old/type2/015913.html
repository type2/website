&gt;Running a 2.0L with 10W-40 dino oil, I noticed that as the oil temp.
&gt;increased to the 210 degree mark while pulling 11,000 foot passes, the
&gt;oil pressure would drop to 20 psi.  As the oil temp would cool to 180
&gt;degrees, the oil pressure increases.  1st question.  Does this indicate
&gt;I'm using to thin an oil?  (I'm trying to make a direct correlation, not
&gt;asking for oil weight opinions or start another FART.)

I would say yes.  Not because of the change in pressure, but because of the
low readings when hot.  A switch to 20-50 would probably raise the 210 and
180 degree readings by 5-10 psi each.

&gt;Secondly, I did a little investigating yesterday and noticed two
&gt;things.  First, I have an oil leak from either a pushrod tube or valve
&gt;cover (cylinder #4 and/or the rear most pushrod tube where it connects
&gt;to the head, not the block).  It's hard to say were the leak is as there
&gt;is oil on each.  Could this be the cause of my loss of oil pressure?  

No.

&gt;Is
&gt;this a detrimental oil leak, or can I continue to drive it for another
&gt;200-1000 miles?  The heads, P&amp;C are less than 4k miles old.

As long as it's not a gusher, it won't hurt the engine, but of course you
should attend to it as soon as possible since it will make a mess, waste
oil, harm the environment, etc....

&gt;Also, I noticed there was a lot of grime around the oil pump/oil filler
&gt;point of contact b/t the block and the cooling shroud.  Should this be
&gt;cleaner than it looks.  I intend to pull the cooling shround and
&gt;investigate when I get the time...

It should be clean, but this is another problem area with respect to oil
leaks.  I suggest you consult Chris Sheridan, whos engine has no oil leaks,
and ask him how he solved the problem.  I am still fighting leaks in this
area myself - possible candidates are the dipstick tube bellows and the
clamp holding the plastic part of the filler neck to the lower metal part
of the filler neck.  I'm going to try permatexing the filler tube clamp
area like someone (Harmon?) suggested here recently.
