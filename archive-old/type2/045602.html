I'm still amazed at how people can afford to wander the country aimlessly.
Where does the cash for grub and gas come from?  And rent/mortgage for the
pad back home?  And parts, etc?  I realize there are ways to economize,  but
this stuff still costs *something*.  Heck, a day's gas with a lightly laden
bus from Sacramento to LA costs better than $50!  So let's say you're in no
hurry, and only travel half that distance in a day - that's still $25/day 
just to keep rolling!  And that's without putting food in da belly.
