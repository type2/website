Hello again

I know this is a topic that has been covered many times in the past, but I
have deleted the links I was supposed to be keeping.  I need to change the
shift rod bushing in a 68 bay.  I have changed the one in my  72 Beetle
before, but I remember reading that the bus is a whole different ball
game....engine out etc...or are there any other ways to do it? Either way,
where can I find the lowdown on what I need to do? Pictures would be a
bonus! Don't want much do I?  Thanks in advance

Tammy
