Subject: Recent thread on homemade exhaust analyzers?

Hi all:

Wasn't there a recent (in the last week or so) thread on homemade exhaust 
analyzers on one or the other of the lists?

I didn't pay much attention at the time, but I remember a comment 
somebody posted regarding using the spring in the AFM to adjust the fuel 
mixture at 3,000 rpm and the mixture screw to adjust the mixture at idle.

I thought I'd go into the archives and re-read that post, but now I'm not 
finding it in either the Vanagon or Type2 archives.

Was it all a dream?
