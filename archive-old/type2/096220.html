&gt; if anyone know the beest place to buy a 2liter longblock please tell me.

the best place is in your own garage
2nd best would be a known and trusted local machinist.
3rd would be one of the reccomended rebuilders on this list
4th would be one of the rebuilders in S Calf
5th the hunk of metal you have now
37th would be GEX
