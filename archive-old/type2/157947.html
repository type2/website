Subject: Re: [T2] Shipping costs

&lt;&lt;No sir, do a little research. Priority is 2-3 days, 1st class is 4-6
days.&gt;&gt;

No Sir.
Go ask the tootsie's behind the counter at any USPS office.
No guaranteed delivery times via Priority Mail.

Take two envelops.
Put a first class stamp on one.
Put a $4.05 stamp on the other.
Mail them both to Bangor Maine.
They'll both get there at the same time--or the first class will get
there first.

Here's another case of believing what you read on the internet Karl---
Don't.
It's all Propaganda

I've been there, done it, and seen it all.

I oughta file a class action suit on the PO for false advertising.

Priority Mail isn't what it used to be.
Only guaranteed  next day, or overnight gets there on as advertised.

Go talk a trip to the PO and ask some questions of your PO
personel---talk to your postmaster---set the record straight .
