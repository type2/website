Steve,

Whoa!

Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you are
castrating the wrong horse here!


In your own words, you say &quot;Facts is Facts&quot;, but you
don't offer any pertinent facts, just opinions.

Further, you state: [paraphrased, here] &quot;while I have
never been a customer, there are too many people on
this list who support him &lt;Ron at Bus Depot&gt;
religiously for his company to be undiligent in trying
to serve his customers.....maybe his success is
starting to catch up with him, I don't know...&quot;

Hmmmm, who are you trying to piss-off, Ron, or the
&quot;many people on this list who support him
religiously&quot;?

Both, I assume. Seriously. If he was the crack-pot
that you infer, then all of his happy customers must
be just as crack-pot as he.


After all, when was the last time you went to the
dealership for *ANYTHING*? Did you get it?! If so,
what was the price? If not, where *DID* you get the
part you so dearly needed?!

Probably some place like Bus Depot, BusBoys, etc. and
they sold you a part that was &lt;what you needed FAR
cheaper than the dealership price EVEN IF the part WAS
available....&gt;. 

If you were not an ungrateful bag of snot, you were
also thankful that these die-hards were even WILLING
to wager *EVERYTHING* in their personal lives so that
they could not only save *YOU* money, but go into
business to offer you &lt;the ungrateful bag of snot, in
this case&gt; this part you so desperately need.

Some of them actually went to EUROPE &lt;ok, only Ron
that I know of&gt; to get parts for busses that haven't
been available in the U.S. for DECADES. 

STILL, the guy's obviously a jerk. I mean, the guy's
*obviously* out to gouge me on shipping parts he
doesn't have, right?!


GIMME A BREAK!!!!!


If it wasn't for people like these, most of us
wouldn't/couldn't even own, much less drive a bus!

You later said in your post &quot;I would tell him &lt;Ron at
BD&gt; not to bite the hand that feeds him....&quot; well sir,
I offer YOU the same advice!!!....

If enough of us bitch about what a jerk he is, he
might just realize that he'd be better off selling
shoes or household appliances and leave us all with
one less source for parts....


PS-I've never met or dealt with Ron Salmon &lt;cool last
name, though&gt;, but I think it's sad that so many
people feel the need to crucify someone because of
their own frustrations. Pretty petty.

Maybe we should all just drive Hondas....that'd REALLY
teach Ron a lesson.......

&gt; 
&gt; I (as well as many other list users) spend a few
&gt; thousand dollars a year on
&gt; VW parts, so this subject is quite interesting to
&gt; me.  I want to know who
&gt; the good suppliers are and who are there just
&gt; siphoning off your hard
&gt; earned money with no service at all.
&gt; 
&gt; I have not used Bus Depot as of yet (because of his
&gt; now changed credit card
&gt; policy), but there are too many people on this list
&gt; who support him
&gt; religiously for his company to be undiligent in
&gt; trying to serve his
&gt; customers.  Maybe his success is starting to catch
&gt; up with him, I don't
&gt; know, but I'd remind him to be careful and remember
&gt; &quot;not to bite the hand
&gt; that feeds you&quot;.  As for RMMW, until this month I
&gt; have had very good
&gt; service.  Early this month, though they sent me crap
&gt; and called it a set of
&gt; main bearings.  They said they were having weather
&gt; problems, but I'm
&gt; wondering if they've just become to arrogant for me
&gt; to continue to trade
&gt; with them?
&gt; 
&gt; Price is important, but my first criterion is
&gt; service and followthrough.
&gt; 
&gt; I've been trying to get parts and machine work done
&gt; for 9 weeks now for a
&gt; spare engine I'm building and everybody seems to be
&gt; screwing up.  What is
&gt; it....Y2K...The Millenium? I don't know, but nobody
&gt; is getting it right!
&gt; 
&gt; Everybody!...  Take three breaths,  mellow out and
&gt; try harder to do it right.
&gt; 
&gt; Please excuse the ramblings of a frustrated VW Bus
&gt; spare time mechanic,
&gt; 
&gt; Have fun
