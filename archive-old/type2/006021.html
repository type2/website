Hi bussers,

This morning (Sat Nov 13) SE Pennsylvania enjoyed
wonderful fall weather and a local group of bus enthusiasts
enjoyed a casual social gathering to kick tires, swap 
tales,
and get acquainted.

We agreed that it was a good plan and to be the model for
more gatherings in the future.

Our plan at this point is to advertise a standing 
invitation
to all interested bussers (and friends) to congregate
once a month (the second Saturday of each month)
at the Pennsburg Diner in Pennsburg, PA
for breakfast and general in-person kabitzing.
(I hope I used that word right..)

Any interested participants should look for others in the
parking lot of the diner between 9:00 an 9:30am, after 
which,
we'll go inside and commandeer an appropriately sized 
table.
(The diner is SW of the intersection of Rt 633 and Rt29 on 
Rt663
in Pennsburg, PA - note that the PA turnpike has an exit 
for
Rt 633 near Quakertown.)

We could change the site in the future, but there is some
benefit to having a predicable place to meet with no need 
for
advance notice or planning.

We also discussed a great idea for the summer; we would
circle-up the busses in the big area behind Ron Salmon's
Bus Depot. (Since most of us bring our own kitchen on 
board,
coffee and breakfast treats should be easy to provide and 
share).

This morning's roster was:
   1.  Karl Bloss
   2.  Ed (CRS) Henckel
   3.  Bryan &amp; Joan Feddish
   4.  Leslie &amp; John Fleischen
   5.  Chris Turner
   6.  Doug Prescott
   7.  Eric Hennig
   8.  Ron Salmon
   9.  Matt Oldham
  10. ( I think I'm missing someone)
  11. and me; Mike Dulany

    Thanks everyone, I enjoyed meeting all of you
and look forward to the next time.
(Let me know if I forgot someone or butchered
the spelling of your name. - sorry)

Mike Dulany
Chalfont, PA
