Subject: Retorque heads?

I Just finished putting new pistons, sleeves and rebuilt heads on my 76 westy 
ran it for about 800 miles (it ran kinda crappy ). went back rechecked 
eveything. Found 0ne air leak a couple of Exhaust leaks and the head bolts 
inside the valve cover where about 3/4 of a turn loose i retorque them . I'm 
going to remove the upper tin this weekend and do the rest of the bolts. I 
would like to know if this is normal of did I F something up?
ps I runs really good right now
