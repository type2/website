Subject: vapor barrier and speakers?
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

hello list,

i'm about to install some speakers into the front door
panels and figured it would be a good time to insulate
the doors. after studying the library posting on sound
proofing and reading the various emails, i haven't
quite figured out how to create an effective vapor
barrier with the back of the speaker jutting into the
door.  has anybody dealt with this issue? any other
suggestions on where to mount front speakers will be
appreciated as well.

have a nice day,

tesa
