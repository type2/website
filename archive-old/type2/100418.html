Subject: decorating the bus for Xmas

Hey everyone.  Well, I installed a new fuel pump, and changed my oil.  After 
going on a 25 mile run, the bus seems ok.  (no fuel in oil)
  Anyway,  I just bought a winter beater, and the bus is going in the side 
yard for now.  I am hoping it will snow a little more for a snowman, next to 
it.  Anyone ever string lights on their bus?  It will be dormant and have 
access to 120v.  Figure I might as well decorate something in the yard.  
Everyone always decorates their house.  What bout the bus?  Anyone drive 
with a wreath?   Merry Christmas everyone!!!!!           Bus Gypsy &amp; Cass
