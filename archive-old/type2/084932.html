Subject: Re: [T2] Couple of air circulation questions

Vent system drainage. Spray water in the vents and it drains here.

Sounds like your flaps need adjustment or the foam weatherstripping is dead.

Take a trip to the hardware store and look at soft foam pipe wrapping.

&gt;I am getting a wind noise from the defost vents. Not all the time, but it 
&gt;seems most prominent around
&gt;60 mph and when there is a cross wind. Is a flap that is supposed be 
&gt;closed opening ???
&gt;
&gt;When doing some other work, I pulled off the pan under the pedals. I 
&gt;noticed a plastic tube about
&gt;1.5 -2 inches diameter that does not go anywhere it just ends there. Is 
&gt;this some sort of recirculation?
&gt;Is this hose/tube related to my first question? TIA
