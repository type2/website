Hey all-
I've located my temp sensor (remeber the choking '77 FI Westy?) and it's not 
loose like someone mentioned it should be if that's what my problem is.  In 
fact, I can't get the bast*#d off!  I'm planning on a new dist 
cap/rotor/points as well (thanks, Sean B.), which could also be the culprit, 
right?  If anyone has a suggestions about this please let me know.  Thanks!
                                                  Chet Needham
                                         '77 Westy &quot;The Monkey Nugget&quot;
