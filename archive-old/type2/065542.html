Since I haven't seen this answered publically yet, I'll take a stab at it.
60 psi is not abnormal.  My own engine sits at 70 psi when cold, and will
go a little higher if I rev the motor up (but I try not to do that).
Anyway, the pressure relief valves limit oil pressure to 28 psi at the
bearings.  60 psi is great - don't worry about it.

&gt;Is it possible for engine to leak oil as a result of the pressure cut
&gt;off valve failing?

Don't know the answer to that one, but I've never heard of one fail on a
properly maintained engine.
