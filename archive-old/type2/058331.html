Subject: Re: Weber and vac dizzy

Bob,
You sure can run a Weber progressive 2 bbl with a stock vacuum advance
distributor. Both myself and a buddy of mine have just that
configuration. We use the dizzy that has only 1 vacuum line. (typically
engines with these dizzys are timed at 7.5 BTDC). 

My buddy was running a 009, and when he changed to the vac advance model
his mileage jumped from 15 mpg to 19 mpg. (The 009 does not advance
enough under light load, it's made for full-throttle applications only -
AKA racing).

Best of luck,

TBone - 77 Westy Deluxe w/tent.
