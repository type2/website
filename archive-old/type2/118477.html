Subject: longterm windscreen storage

I worked in spare parts awhile in another life. They were in boxes and
internally supported with foam blocks so that the screens own weight was not
placing stress on it. They sat for years horiz. And Vertically too. If you can
find a box to suit  I would get it and do that. If you cant find one paint it
with fiberglass release agent, build a box to suit and support it with that
gooshie stuff that builders use. It expands as foam and then sets like a
brick. Don't surround it, support it. When you need it it should lift away
easily. Barry wright
