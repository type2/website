&gt;Hey- I have a '72 Westy with an orignal pancake 1700cc engine.  My head

&gt;get a new 1800cc or 2100cc.  
&gt;First question? Will the 2100cc fit in my engine compartment? or even 
&gt;the 1800cc for that matter?

I think your friend meant 2000, not 2100.  Both the 2000 and the 1800 will
fit in your engine compartment - there is no significant difference between
them from the outside. 

&gt;Second question?  Has anyone done this?  Will the cost be not worth it?  
&gt;what is the avg cost to replace the engine?

Around $2,000 - $1500-ish for the engine and $500-ish for the labor.  I
have a 2000cc in my '73, and so do several others on the list.  Consider
either AVP or Mark Stephens for purchasing your engine, and I'd recommend
avoiding GEX.  You could also have your original engine made into an 1800
fairly cheaply - the only difference is the cylinders and pistons, and you
would have to have the 1700 heads flycut, but if you're replacing the heads
anyway, just get 1800 heads and you're all set.
