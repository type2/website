&gt;As far as I know these are the only new heads available (especially
&gt;for a 76-78 bay). They are warranteed plus with proper CR ing I think
&gt;seat problems can be eliminated.  Did Mark Stephens ever actually
&gt;deliver a 100,000 mile head?  I don't think so.

Nope but has anyone ever seen better than 60k on a set of AMC
heads?  I don't think so either, not square port AMC's least ways.

Not to knock Steve's price on these, it is quite fair, real damn fair
actually, just saying the Spanish heads don't really have that great
a rep either.

And of course new German 1.7 heads that can be cut for a 2.0 are
still available from FAT or Reichert if you can ever get in touch with
them.  Not for Vanagons unfortunately, sigh...
