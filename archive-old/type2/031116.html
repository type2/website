&gt; I just replaced the engine in my 79 Camper (2L FI). The engine I put in leaks oil when running. The oil is dripping down from the oil filter. I have changed the oil filter (and oil ...) and made sure that the oil filter is screwed on tight. 
&gt; 
&gt; This raises two questions:
&gt; 1. What is the likely source of my leak - oil cooler, oil pressure sensor, or something else ?
&gt; 2. Can I take off the fan housing with the engine still in the car?

yes, it is a PITA as far as I'm concerned, but I've done it on my 78

&gt; Also, I just parted out a 79 bus. I have everything except engine, bumpers, steering box, and wiper motor, including a rust and dent free nose panel (including windshield frame), a 5-rail tranny and a solid front axle beam. If you need any parts let me know. I am located in Maryland.

how much for the front Axle beam. (is it the same as 78??)

I'm also in Maryland (Baltimore)

I don't have any of the parts your looking for, sorry

Bob
