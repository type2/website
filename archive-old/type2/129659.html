Subject: RE: [T2] mattress

It will be in an RV. The mattress will not be folded, but it will have to be a
custom size and a good fit. I am not sure that futon will work for this
situation . I am either going to have one really big one or three smaller
ones. The smallest being a filler between to twin beds. It would be about 24
inches wide. I am thinking some kind of solid lightweight foam used for
houses. They make it in 2 inch size. Then cover this with some form of soft
foam as the actual mattress covering.

&gt;I am trying to figure out a way to make a custom size mattress for a non VW
&gt;vehicle...

What kind of vehicle?  And are you looking to have it work in conjunction
with a fold-down bench seat or something similar?  Futon mattresses may work
well in that they tend to be light, comfortable, pliable  and not overly
thick...
