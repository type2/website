Subject: Re: [T2] gas tank resto  varnish/sludge

Ronnie,

Had one that sat for 8 years.

http://www.shockwaverider_dot_com/78bustankjob/

Picture #12 shows what happened to the gas.  1/4 of rock hard
residue all in the bottom of the tank...and that was after letting
paint thinner sit in it for 3 weeks.

Take it out and *look*.  Then take it to a radiator shop that will &quot;boil&quot;
it out.  Trust me, don't bother with any other chemicals on the inside.

Go back after it is done, but don't delay as it will start rusting almost 
immediately.  

Clean the inside after that with por-15 marine clean and then decide 
whether to coat the inside or not.  I did not as I have an FI tank with 
lots of protrusions inside.

Paint it outside with por-15.

Reinstall.

Cheers ,dave

&gt; Finally made time to work on getting the 57 on the road. It's been sitting
&gt; since 88 when it was driven down to one of the so cal shows and back and
&gt; had been parked for an unknown amount of time prior to 88. You can smell the
&gt; varnish when you open the tank. fuel resevrve switch was completely clogged
&gt; and gummed up to the point that I had to remove it to drain the tank.
&gt; Looking at the por-15 kit they claim their chemicals will clean this out but
&gt; the hot rod guys I've talked to say nothing will and I should have it sand
&gt; blasted inside. Anyone have hands on experience with cleaning out a tank
&gt; with 10-15 years of varnish build up? Using this product or any
&gt; other?http://www.por15_dot_com/tankseal_fuelpreserve.html
