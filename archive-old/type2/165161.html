Hi Kevin,

On the trip from Buffalo-Bedford I was testing a new route heading  
basically due south straight out of Buffalo. In theory it would cut  
an hour off the trip. In practice it added an extra hour and a half,  
because the grades on the secondary roads were a LOT steeper than the  
interstate. And a lot of the hills had no passing lanes, so I wasn't  
a really popular guy by the time I crested the hill in second gear.

Coming back I used the interstate, and stayed well to the right at  
all times. It was a lot less stress, because the grades were much  
more gradual.

Either way, I didn't get any nasty looks that I can recall. My bus  
looks far too friendly for that. ;-P

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; then, though.
