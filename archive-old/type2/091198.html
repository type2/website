&gt; 1) At what location do I connect a vacuum gage and what should the vacuum
&gt; be?

Assuming you have a stock 75 w/ FI it's similar in design to my 79.
While I'm not sure this is the best place I usually attach it to the
vacuum line that goes from the manifold to the decel valve. OK I
confess, I hook it up this way b/c I lost the little tee fitting for
my gauge :) 

&gt; 2) My compression gage is the screw in type with a hose 12&quot; attached to the
&gt; gage.  The problem is the fitting goes all the way into the motor sheet
&gt; metal and I am afraid that if I screw it in by turning the hose, I will not
&gt; be able to get it back out.  Is there a trick to this or a better type gage
&gt; to use?

I have the same type of fitting &amp; havent had any problems using the
hose to loosen it after checking the cyl.

&gt;  
&gt; 3) I want to be able to listen to the radio when the motor is off but have
&gt; read on the list that the points may weld together if they happen to be in
&gt; the wrong position.  How can I avoid this, I have a 0231 181 012
&gt; distributor.  Can I use a breakerless system in this distributor, if so is
&gt; there more than one brand and which is best and why?
 
I think you are actually wanting an ignition w/ accessory position. I
have seen these at RMMW but cannot say how good they are or even if
they fit in our busses. 

&gt; 4) For the first ten minutes of driving or so when I come to a stop the bus
&gt; doesn't want to idle and dies.  It starts right back up but why wont it
&gt; idle?

I would check two things first. Look for a vacuum leak &amp; test the cold
start valve per bentley.
