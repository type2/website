Subject: [T2] Whats this about my Yak?

Hi Steve,

    I guess I've been lucky over the years, as I was taught in a Volkswagen
school to use lube, and have always used some kind, silicone lube, soap,
even plane water in a pinch. I have never had much trouble with leakage.
Although when we do have a leak, a little silicone sealer from the outside
seems to do the job ok, in the perfect world no sealer at all would be the
answer, but------------.
    Your right about silicone and paint, that is why before we paint, we
spend several, several days on prep work, before the paint gun comes out.
You never know what's been on a car, lots of nasties out there, never know
what someone has done installing a windshield. Ha! :-) :-)
    Now I want to know what your intentions are with my Yak? You know I have
a shotgun, Son!

See ya!
