Terry:

Been there, heard that.  Try this.  Disarm the ignition system in some way
such as removing the high voltage wire from the coil to the center of the
distributor so your engine will crank freely, but won't start.  Crank your
engine through several cycles.  Do you hear the same sound??  Does it sound
like the compression stroke on one cylinder is faster than the other
three???  Like maybe one cylinder has less compression than the other
three??  Follow up with a compression test.

I've heard this sound three times in my life.  Each time it mean't a valve job.

Hope this helps.
