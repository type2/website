+AD4- after reading the posts for the last several months, I've noticed
+AD4- there seems to be a thread developing over the issue of parts..
+AD4- Is there a parts scarcity for our beloved buses, or
+AD4- can we go on driving them well into the next millennium?
+AD4-
+AD4- There are alot of newcomers to this list, that are contemplating
+AD4- purchasing a bus, westy kombi, call it what you will.
+AD4- They hear of the trials and tribulations of list members trying
+AD4- to fix up their buses..unable to find the right part they need...
+AD4- Then someone will cross the big pond, visit the elves in the
+AD4- Black Forest, return with a motherlode of +ACI-original VW parts+ACI-
+AD4- With the usual comment of, +ACI-lookie here, found these parts that
+AD4- haven+ADs-t been available for last decade on North American soil'+ACI-
+AD4- and  +ACI- when they're gone, thats it forever+ACI-  and then a year
+AD4- later...guess what...wonder of wonders the elves in the Black Forest
+AD4- have come thru again...more parts???
+AD4- Now..don't get me wrong....I'm not trying to slam
+AD4- retail/wholesale sellers of bus parts..
+AD4- Will the parts supply ever really end..??  I can't help but feel
+AD4- that alot of the newcomers to this list and indeed to the VW scene
+AD4- in general..are going to be discouraged about the parts scarcity
+AD4- that seems to be eminating from the list..the last few months...
+AD4- I for one would hope and like to think we will be able to keep
+AD4- our buses running indefinitely.
+AD4- So...parts scare...myth or reality??


As far as I am concerned, with rare exception, there isn't a scarcity of
parts for '68-79 Type 2's (at least for now).  There are glaring exceptions
(axle beams, fuel filler tubes, and certain '76-78 heat/exhaust parts
immediately come to mind), but for the most part, the manufacture of Type
2's in South America (and the resulting supply of aftermarket parts as well,
to support both these and the German busses) has resulted in a reasonably
good supply of parts (considering the age and relatively scarcity of the
vehicles).  The fact that most parts are interchangeable year-to-year has
only improved this situation.  What is scarce is outlets for these parts -
i.e. you can't grab a '68 master cylinder off of the shelf of a local FLAPS+ADs-
you may have to order it- but if you have the right sources, most parts can
be found (and typically rather inexpensively).

Now, in some cases, quality and price may be a different question.  While
many parts are still available from aftermarket sources, in some cases these
parts are not equal in quality to the original parts.  Thus the excitement
when a stash of original-equipment parts is found, particularly when they
are found for below the going rate for lesser aftermarket ones.  A savy bus
owner will take advantage of these limited opportunities and stock up on
those things that make sense when a good deal comes around.  The N.O.S. heat
exchangers I imported are a good example. Yes, replacement heat exchangers
will be available in a year, or two, or three, but they are highly unlikely
to be the N.O.S. VW ones that are presently available. So some people will
opt to stick a pair of N.O.S. ones in their garage for safe-keeping, while
others will just settle for the somewhat thinner aftermarket ones when the
time comes that they need them.  It's mostly a matter of how far ahead you
are thinking and how your financial situation is right now.  Other items,
like those fog lights or retractable steps, are exciting to find new after
so many years of unavailability, but let's face it, your bus is not exactly
going to be relegated to a junkyard if you don't have them.

Are you likely to find yourself in a position where your bus is +ACI-grounded+ACI-
for a long time due to unavailability of parts?  It's not likely, but it is
certainly possible.  If your front axle beam rusts out (something that is
increasingly common these days), you will find that new beams are
unavailable and good used ones harder and harder to come by. This is a
situation that will eventually take a huge number of busses off the road+ADs- it
has already begun.  If your fuel filler neck is shot, it may take many
junkyard attempts or some fabrication to solve the problem.  But in other
cases, a little good-old jury-rigging can do wonders.  I doubt that before I
found those brake pedal return springs, for example, people were parking
their busses because their brake pedals didn't return.  They were modifying
other springs to work, or finding junkyard parts.  So the availability of
new springs for +ACQ-1.99 didn't save anyone's bus, it just saved someone a bit
of hassle for +ACQ-1.99.  And more common parts like brakes, front end parts,
engine parts, etc. are readily available at reasonable prices.

Are you likely to find yourself in a position where your bus is +ACI-grounded+ACI-
for a +AF8-short+AF8- time due to unavailability of parts?  Much more likely.  As I
said, you can't buy many parts for an old bus off-the-shelf, so you may have
to mail-order a part that would have been readily available if you were
driving a 1990 Ford Taurus.  This may mean that a nuisence repair will keep
your bus off the road for a week, whereas it could have been remedied within
hours on a more common/modern vehicle (albeit perhaps at significant cost,
both for the part and for the labor to install it given the complexity of
many modern vehicles).

Driving/owning a Bus is a unique experience and a consious decision.  It is
not the same thing as driving/owning a similar vintage Chevy Nova, say.
Busses have their personalities and quirks.  It takes a certain kind of
person to want a Bus, and to be willing to mail-order for certain parts, put
up with no heat in the winter, and go to five tire places to find one that
has sidewall-reinforced tires.  Is parts availability an issue?  Yes, but
not compared to many other vehicles of a similar age.  For 20-40 year old
vehicles, parts availability for busses is, in my opinion, excellent.  But
they are 20-40 year old vehicles and must be considered within that context.
If you want a vehicle where every part will be easily available, and is
likely to be for some time, don't buy a bus.  These vehicles are old and
have 200k, 300k, 800k miles on them.  They will need more parts than a five
year old Ford with 40k on the odometer does, and when they do, the parts
will be harder to find. And yes, as the busses continue to age, yes, the
situation will worsen.  On the other hand, many commonly-needed parts are
much cheaper for a bus than for most other cars (older or newer).  Try
buying a complete exhaust system for that 5-year-old Ford for +ACQ-79.  Try
working on that Ford in your backyard, using only hand tools.

So from my point of view, I guess my feeling is that no, there is not enough
of a parts problem to warrant not driving a bus - if you are the sort of
person who should be driving a bus in the first place.  Jerry Garcia once
compared Deadheads (fans of his band, the Grateful Dead) to people who like
licorice.  Licorice is not for everyone, he said, but those people who like
it +AF8-really+AF8- like it.  I guess the same could be said about VW bus
enthusiasts.
