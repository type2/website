&gt; 1.   I know from owning beetles that the shifter is supposed to be sloppy.
&gt; Nearly hits dash for 1st, hits emerg brake handle for 3rd, lots and lots of
&gt; play.  How do you tell whether to replace shifter or tighten at tranny?  

Get under the bus, have someone move the shifter and see where the play is occurring. Most likely at the very front (shifting rod end slides in clear plastic bushing) and very end (shifter coupling, where the linkage mounts onto the Tanny.

&gt; I have seen devices for beetles to tighten shifting, will they work for bus,
&gt; are they worth the trouble?  

They work but do not rely on them to compensate for bad bushings, finding the right gear gets even harder. But after replacing the bushings, go for one, the make shifting a lot easier and faster.

There are two bushings you can replace only with engine and Tanny replaced (inside the shifting rod rube). If you pull the Tanny at some point, replace them; if you don't just replacing the front bushing and rear coupling should help a lot. Get a Poly Urethane coupling (I think Empi makes them), they last longer than the stock rubber ones. And remember to reuse the wire to secure the coupling screws.

Cheers,
Marcus
