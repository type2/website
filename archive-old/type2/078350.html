&gt; It's not what it sounds like! Just a hypothetical question for the list:

&gt; Would it be possible to convert an air-cooled VW engine to run on 100%
&gt; ethanol? If it is possible, what would be involved? Would it work on carbs
&gt; or fuel injection, or both maybe? Change valve sizes, material,
&gt; lift/duartion, CR?  Hotter spark plugs? Anything else come to mind? Let's
&gt; assume that the supply of ethanol isn't a problem and that we're talking
&gt; about a small fleet, not a single vehicle.

I wouldn't be surprised if Volkswagen do Brasil has done just this.  They
have a big alcohol fuel push there.

Bascially, you need to richen fuel mixture.  You may also increase
compression ratio as alcohol is higher octane.
