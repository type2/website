I wouldn't use oven cleaner on aluminum either. I watched a thing several
years ago on TV where Mr. Wizard was was demonstrating exothermisity by
spraying oven cleaner, mostly sodium hydroxide or lye, onto a sheet of
aluminum foil and then having the kid wad up the foil and wait a few
minutes to see what happened. Of course, the foil got hot and to make the
point even clearer, he had the poor bugger unfold the foil. Needless to say
it was much hotter inside and the smoke coming off damned near asphixiated
the kid. There's also a very active catalyst called raney nickel which is a
mixture of nickel and aluminum. To activate it, you soak it in sodium
hydroxide to leach out the aluminum and leave behind a very high surface
area nickel. Long expanation for a short answer....don't spray oven cleaner
on aluminum either. Not a good thing.
