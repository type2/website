.
&gt;   It's nice, because in California, there's no smog for up to '73, and so I
 can unscrupulously modify if I like,

NO NO NO! You are totally mistaken. You LEGALLY cannot modify any 66-73 vehicle in California. There is a BIG
difference between having to do the biennial smog check and the smog law.

Here is Section 27156 of the California Vehicle Code:

27156.  (a) No person shall operate or leave standing upon any
highway any motor vehicle which is a gross polluter, as defined in
Section 39032.5 of the Health and Safety Code.
   (b) No person shall operate or leave standing upon any highway any
motor vehicle which is required to be equipped with a motor vehicle
pollution control device under Part 5 (commencing with Section 43000)
of Division 26 of the Health and Safety Code or any other certified
motor vehicle pollution control device required by any other state
law or any rule or regulation adopted pursuant to that law, or
required to be equipped with a motor vehicle pollution control device
pursuant to the National Emission Standards Act (42 U.S.C. Secs.
1857f-1 to 1857f-7, inclusive) and the standards and regulations
adopted pursuant to that federal act, unless the motor vehicle is
equipped with the required motor vehicle pollution control device
which is correctly installed and in operating condition.  No person
shall disconnect, modify, or alter any such required device.
   (c) No person shall install, sell, offer for sale, or advertise
any device, apparatus, or mechanism intended for use with, or as a
part of, any required motor vehicle pollution control device or
system which alters or modifies the original design or performance of
any such motor vehicle pollution control device or system.
   (d) If the court finds that a person has willfully violated this
section, the court shall impose the maximum fine that may be imposed
in the case, and no part of the fine may be suspended.
   (e) &quot;Willfully,&quot; as used in this section, has the same meaning as
the meaning of that word prescribed in Section 7 of the Penal Code.
   (f) No person shall operate a vehicle after notice by a traffic
officer that the vehicle is not equipped with the required certified
motor vehicle pollution control device correctly installed in
operating condition, except as may be necessary to return the vehicle
to the residence or place of business of the owner or driver or to a
garage, until the vehicle has been properly equipped with such a
device.
   (g) The notice to appear issued or complaint filed for a violation
of this section shall require that the person to whom the notice to
appear is issued or against whom the complaint is filed produce proof
of correction pursuant to Section 40150 or proof of exemption
pursuant to Section 4000.1 or 4000.2.
   (h) This section shall not apply to an alteration, modification,
or modifying device, apparatus, or mechanism found by resolution of
the State Air Resources Board to do either of the following:
   (1) Not to reduce the effectiveness of any required motor vehicle
pollution control device.
   (2) To result in emissions from any such modified or altered
vehicle which are at levels which comply with existing state or
federal standards for that model year of the vehicle being modified
or converted.
   (i) This section applies to motor vehicles of the United States or
its agencies, to the extent authorized by federal law.

Here is Section 44080 of the Health and Safety Code [read paragraph e and f]:

44080.  The Legislature finds and declares as follows:
   (a) California's air is the most polluted in the nation and the
largest source of that pollution is automobiles.
   (b) California has the most stringent new car emission standards
in the nation as well as a vehicle inspection (smog check) program
that result in most cars producing very little pollution.
   (c) A small percentage of automobiles cause a disproportionate and
significant amount of the air pollution in California.
   (d) These gross polluters are primarily vehicles in which the
emission control equipment has been disconnected or which are very
poorly maintained.
   (e) New technologies, such as remote sensing, can identify gross
polluters on the roads, enabling law enforcement authorities to stop,
inspect, and cite vehicles with disconnected emission control
equipment, and can promote the development of incentives for the
repair of other high-emitting vehicles.
   (f) Requiring owners to reconnect emission control  equipment and
developing incentives for needed maintenance on high-emitting
vehicles may be cost-effective methods to reduce emissions and help
achieve air quality standards in many districts.

Yes, Remote Sensing is coming.....

And if an idiot named Senato Florez gets his way, all vehicles from 1960 will require a smog check!!
