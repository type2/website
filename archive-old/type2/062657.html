&gt;&gt;Course it may be gone by now anyway, just thought I'd mention
&gt;&gt;it anyway.
&gt;
&gt;It wasn't gone the last day of the show, and I don't think anyone 
&gt;was looking seriously at it.  It was a diamond in the rough, tho-

It sold to someone in St. Louis sight-unseen for $4000.  It was an 
interesting bus and almost complete, but I thought it was worth 
more like $2000 or a little more.  It was a 1960 and not a 1959.
