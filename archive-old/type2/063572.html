Subject: Re: Confused! 20w50? 15w40? 10w30? ACK!

&gt;
&gt;i've been told 20w50 is too heavy for this climate. i'm told folks round
&gt;here run this weight all the time. i'm told 10w30 is for colder climates.
&gt;i'm told 10w30 is good for this climate. i'm told 15w40 is a good alternative.
&gt;ack! ack! ack! ack! ack!
&gt;
&gt;opinions?

        When all else fails, go with Bentley. It may be overkill, but what
the hell, oil is cheap. I don't have Bentley here at school, but email me
if you want the oil info, and I'll look it up at home.

Peace,
