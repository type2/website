Subject: Smog specifics for 68-79 busses

The CA smog referee let me take a photocopy of the info from the Mitchell
Repair Information manual (Emission Control Applications Guide) they use to
smog 68-79 air cooled VWs.  I'm sure any mechanic on the list who orders
Mitchell books can get this manual.

Their copier was having troubles and it's too poor a copy to scan so I'll
reproduce the bay window items from the page here.  This is what they are
looking for on each particular model year of bay window bus:

1968-1969 Type 2 Carb -- PCV, ACL, TP
1970 Type 2 Carb -- PCV, ACL, 2 EVAP, 3 EVAP-VC, 1 TP
1971 Type 2 Carb -- PCV, ACL, EVAP, SPK, EVAP-VC, SPK-DDD, 1 TP
1972 Type 2 Dual Carb -- PCV, ACL, EVAP, SPK, EVAP-VC, SPK-TCS
1973 Type 2 Carb -- 5 PCV, ACL, EVAP, EGR, SPK, AP, EVAP-VC, SPK-DDD
1974 All -- PCV, ACL, EVAP, 9 EGR, SPK, 8 AIS, EVAP-VC, 14 SPK-DDD
1975 Type 2 MFI -- PCV, ACL, EVAP, 2 15 OC, 2 FR, EGR, SPK, EVAP-VC, SPK-DDD
1976 Type 2 MFI -- PCV, ACL, 16 EVAP, 2 15 OC, 2 FR, EGR
1977 Type 2 MFI -- PCV, ACL, 16 EVAP, 2 OC, 2 FR, EGR
1978 All -- PCV, ACL, 16 EVAP, 2 10 OC, 2 10 FR, EGR, 12 AIS
1979 Type 2 MFI -- PCV, 16 EVAP, OC, FR, 13 EGR, 2 O2S, 2 CEC

Legend:

PCV - Positive Crankcase Ventilation
ACL - Thermostatic Air Cleaner
EVAP- Fuel Evaporative System
SPK - Spark Ignition Control (all advance, retard hardware and hoses)
EGR - Exhaust Gar Recirculation System
AP  - Air Pump Injection System
OC  - Oxidation Catalytic Converter (vs. TWC 3-way cat)
FR  - Fill Pipe Restrictor
AIS - Air Injection system
O2S - Oxygen sensor
CEC - Computerized Engine Controls
TP  - Throttle Positioner
EVAP-VC - EVAP Vapor Canister
SPK-DDD - Spark Dual Diaphragm Distributor
SPK-TCS - Transmission Controlled Spark

Exception codes for legend:

01 - M/T only
02 - California Models only
03 - Some models
05 - Some Type 2
08 - Type 2, Dasher(CA) &amp; Type 4
09 - Except 410 A/T
10 - Carb only
12 - Except Type 1 &amp; 2
13 - Federal only
14 - Except Type 1
15 - EPA authorized removal on some models. Check for door label.
16 - Vapor canister type

I think there are some discrepancies above but that's what the book says.

After the visual inspection the first thing they check is the timing.  It
can be at most +/- 3 degrees.  Anything outside of the range and they fail
it right away.

The RPM has to be within the correct idle range as well or it will fail
right away.

Take a good gas cap with you with a good rubber seal.  They hook it up to a
pressure tester on the last test with a dark blue adapter to see if it
seals.

The emission test is not done on the dyno for some reason.  They leave it in
neutral the whole time.  At least for 1978, they test %CO2, %02, HC(PPM) and
%CO but not NO(PPM).
