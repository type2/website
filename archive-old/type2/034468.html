Subject: egr valves???

They are EGR valves. At the same level on the back of each manifold is
a
bolted on pipe. Follow it from the left carb and it has a tee where it
goes
forward thru the front upper tin and then down to the EGR filter. This
is
exhaust. The balance tube also goes to the intake manifolds, but it is
just
mounted to the front upper tin and has rubber elbows on each end.


i read and re-read this and i simply do not follow.   i do not see any
bolted on pipe??  and second where do the vac lines connect to if this
*dashpot* thing is an egr valve??  

or point me to the correct book to read up on the subject.

thanks
zzz
