Subject: re: [T2] cut off hose

Hi Christopher,

Ohh..... That hose!!!!   :^)

I have a 1.8L 1974 VW 412 engine that has two of those (one per
side)... they are connected to the case breather box.

Since your engine has one head that doesn't have the smog port plugs,
(and one that does) it tells me that something must have come from
somewhere else.... and in this case I would expect that the somewhere
else was from a 412.

If it's capped off properly, you've got nothing to worry about.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; I do have a hose coming off the carb- intake manifold (it's a Solex
&gt; progressive actually) that goes up front.  I'm assuming this is to the
&gt; brake booster.  The hose I'm asking about comes off the engine right
&gt; next to where the intake runner goes in.  It's just cut off and there
&gt; is no vaccum or pressure coming out of it.  Totally weird.  Now that I
&gt; think about it, it's not off the tin if it's right next to the intake,
&gt; it's just off the head.. Weird..maybe I'll get some response from some
&gt; auto trans. owners since this is an auto trans. engine, I'm starting
&gt; to assume it has something to do with that.
&gt; Thanks for your time!  -Chris
