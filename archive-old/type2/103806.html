Subject: Re: [T2] Optima Batteries

Hey there-

The AGMs have lower self discharge, don't gas (when properly charged), and
maintain higher voltage throughout their discharge cycle, which is important
for voltage sensitive items like computers, act.

It is hard to beat the economy and simplicity of a basic wet cell. Just make
sure that it is a deep cycle battery, NOT a starting battery if your
intention is to run loads from the battery without the engine running.

Cheers,
Matthew

&gt; I'm still trying to figure out the advantage of the $130 Optima over a $50
&gt; Pep Boys battery in a $10 plastic battery box.  The optima is nicely
&gt; sealed (not totally though, as it still can vent), but that completely
&gt; removes any chance to revive it if it gets overcharged.  One stuck voltage
&gt; regulator and that expensive battery is toast.
