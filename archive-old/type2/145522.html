Subject: exhaust manifold gaskets

hey folks. I'm looking to swap out my little non-bus heater boxes with
some 72-74 style ones. In reviewing RAtwell's site
(http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/Exhaust.html) for getting the right
parts together, I need new copper gaskets and a few other things.
Fellow listmember Hal has seen my frankenmotor and believes I have 2L
(roundport) heads. Dandy. I go a-looking for copper gaskets and BD has
1700 and 1800-2000 gaskets. So, now I'm a little concerned. First, if
the gaskets between the 2 types of heads are different enough that they
have a different pricepoint ($0.79 -v- $1) and a different part number
(021256251A -v- 039256251) will the heater boxes fit right? I got the
heater boxes a year ago and can't remember if they are 72-74 or 78.
They do have the trapezoidal ends, so I at least know they are one of
those 2 types. They are in great shape (thanks &quot;theBusCo&quot; Ken) with
almost no rust. I've only performed a quickie check to see that the
mating points are flat and even across the pipes. I have yet to take
the necessary measurements to insure a fit, though. Regardless, I'm
optomistic about these exchangers increasing the heat coming through
the defrost enough so that I don't have to drive with a squeegie
anymore :)

Questions:
which gaskets are right? (gut says 1800-2000 ones)
is there a meaningful difference betwen the 72-74 and 78 heater boxes
that would make this install problematic?
Any advice that goes beyond Richard's site, or the linked comments from
Jamie Rivers?

thanks!
