Subject: Sparkling clean pop-top!

Whoever suggested using X-14 to clean a Westy pop-top on this list was 
right on the money.  I gave my top a good scrubbing today.  3 normal 
size bottles of X-14 &quot;Maximum strength&quot; and about an hour and a half of 
elbow grease with a stiff bristle brush on a broom handle later, my top 
looks like almost brand-new!

My top was dark-grey with years of &quot;parked under trees&quot; build-up, and 
now it just sparkles.  Now I just need a little naval jelly on the 
rusty bolts, and some new stainless steel tie-downs...
