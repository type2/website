Subject: RE: Brake booster rebuild

The brakes still function, a bit on the stiff side, but they still work.  Is
this pretty normal?


It's the status quo on my bus. I've often thought I'd like to get the brake 
booster fixed ... but it stops quite well so I don't mind that much. 
Ultimately, the fluid, lines and pads have much more to do with stopping 
power than the booster. But I too have thought about rebuilding it myself 
(there is a kit, at least there used to be). Well, someday ...
