&gt; Good tool for low lying filter removal, and you won't puncture the side
&gt; of the can using large channel locks, and have the oil running down your
&gt; arm in the process.
&gt;  
&gt; &lt;&lt;I heard there was a longer filter avail..&gt;&gt;

The Mann filter for an early VW diesel works fine, and is longer. It does
hang down as Jamie mentioned. I have used them at times because they are the
same as another vehicle I drive, and once I changed the oil and noticed the
x-long filter had a big dent in it.

The only thing about the tools people are suggesting, is that none of them
work properly with the Mann 920/17, which is the best filter for a Bus. The
Mann has a serrated or splined base with 45 flutes, not 14 flutes like the
tools in the links. The Mahle OC28 is the same serrated base. The 14-flute
tool will &quot;sort of&quot; work on a serrated base filter, but not really well. The
45-flute tool is available but I have only ever seen them in a big toolkit
full of filter wrenches, never on their won.

I recommend the three-jaw on 2-jaw clamping style wrenches. The two-jaw in
particular works well on the serrated base.
