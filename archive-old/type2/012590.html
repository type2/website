Dear Doktor,

Please re-read my post.
I have done quite a lot of business with the Nuevo
Laredo dealer and will continue to do so and recomend
them to others. I just didn't order the fans. I didn't
complain about the price, I just didn't order them.
New fans are probably worth $450+ a piece that I was
quoted. I just couldn't justify the expense at the
time.
You make me sound like a cheapskate. My suppliers know
otherwise.

Seth

&gt; &gt;I have never even considered going into a VW
&gt; &gt;dealership in the US because of some of the
&gt; comments I
&gt; &gt;have heard on the list.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I have been to the dealership across the river in
&gt; &gt;Nuevo Laredo and they have always been nice and
&gt; &gt;helpful. They even gave me a partsbook! 
&gt; &gt;On one occasion they looked up ambulance fans for
&gt; me
&gt; &gt;and they were still available. The cost kept me
&gt; from
&gt; &gt;placing and order, though. I could buy another bus
&gt; for
&gt; &gt;that kind of money!
