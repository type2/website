Subject: friday commentary on helpfulness

hey volks, 
happy friday!  this happened to me earlier this week,
but it is low on bus content, so i waited till today. 
 i dont know if its because of all the weirdos in
society or a lack of caring on peoples parts, but no
one wants to help anyone out anymore.   im just
thankful of the vehicles i drive,  and the people who
drive them.   one of course is the bus, and the other
is my J**P CJ.   both vehicles have owners who are
happy to see another and give a happy wave, and will
always help out another in need.   as i was driving
home earlier this week in my CJ (bus engine out) i ran
out of gas, (gauge and odometer don't work!) so i was
walking down a main road in 95 degree freakin heat,
with at least a mile walk in either direction to a
store/gas station etc. and no one will even stop to
see if i need help!   and its not like i looked like
your typical hippy or grungy scary guy at the time.  
i have to dress up for work so i had on khakis and was
down to a t-shirt because of the heat but come on
people, i bet at least a dozen or more cars drove buy,
until finally another jeep, bound by unwritten law,
stopped and picked me up, no questions asked.   thats
one of the reasons i drive what i do, i usually like
fellow drivers of said vehicles and can always count
on them to help me out, and i in turn do the same.  
so i just wish that everyone could be a bit more like
us bus owners and lend a helping hand.   im glad ive
found such a great community in the air cooled vw
scene and its people like you guys who help me keep
lizzy on the road.   so a big friday thank you for
anyone whos ever stopped to help someone in need, be
it another bus owner or someone else.
have a good weekend!
