&gt; Massachusetts by the 4th and Burlington on the 6th. I'll be taking scenic
&gt; (slow) routes as much as possible, starting with the Blue Ridge Parkway.

the Blue Ridge is a lot of long steep pulls and also long steep
downgrades. and few if any services.  make sure your brakes are in good
shape
 &gt; 

&gt; (thoughts of hitting NYC to see the WTC site being delayed
&gt; until the trip back).

take the subway or train into Mannhattan, nearest parking space is New
Jersey!

&gt; Any recommendations on routes through Maryland, Pennsylvania, NJ, NY? I'll
&gt; be staying with family in Massachusetts and friends in Burlington. I'd love

come up US 15 Va/MD/into PA spend the night in Harrisburg area, Follow 11
out of Harrisburg up the Susquehanna river to Mifflinville, jump onto I-80
east for about 30 miles to rt 93 South to Hazelton, Near Jim Thorpe PA
grab US 209 North through the Delaware Water Gap into New York.

this is an absolutely beautiful trip and it is also long, slow and hilly,
if you are having any trouble though there is usually a decent size city
or Interstate not too far away.

&gt; the speed my oil temp breaks 220 degrees. I'm not comfortable with that -

230-235 is when I begin to get nervous, at 240 I slow down and at 250 I
pull over

enjoy
