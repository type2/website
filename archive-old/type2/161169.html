Subject: RE: [T2] Running rich when warm issue is back (On my knees 
  begging for  help)

Hmmm. Grounding the CHT circuit did nothing? That's
not encouraging. It's hard to make anything fit the
&quot;only when warmed up&quot; scenario you have set for us,
except for two things: CHT sensor or cracked head
that's bad enough it opens up when hot and closes when
cold. If that were it though, it would run fine at
high rpm but not idle at all. It generally takes a
couple hours to cool down enough to restart when the
heads cracked. 

If there is some randomness to it, it could be a bad
wire on the CHT circuit. To check, you need a
continuity tester or a buzzer with long test leads &amp;
alligator clips, making the wire between the clips the
&quot;switch&quot; for the buzzer. Using your Bentley manual,
find the wire connector corresponding to the CHT wire
in the big plug that plugs into the analog computer
for the FI. Clip one lead to each end and wiggle and
pull at the wires until you are satisfied that it is /
isn't the problem.

Something nobody has hit on yet (I think) is the other
temp sensor in the AFM / air cleaner housing. With an
ohmmeter you can check it from the AFM plug
connectors.

Your throttle body doesn't have a throttle position
switch attached to it, does it? A '77 might...

Should not be heat related though.

Did you ever check your old CHT sensor? You can check
them with an ohmmeter in or out of the vehicle. Check
the resistance from the body of the unit to the wire
end. At room temperature, it should be 2400 ohms. Put
the hair dryer to it and watch the resistance drop.
Put it in the fridge and then check it later -
resistance should be up significantly. Ratwell's site
has excellent details of all this.

Carefully inspect the wires around the double relays
and the resistor pack. Be sure the ground wire that
attaches to the mounting screw is secure. Unplug /
plug all connectors multiple times, watching for wires
that don't stay in step with the others - a loose
connector in a plug is sometimes a culprit. Still not
heat related though.

Unplug the thermo-time switch. It's tough to get to,
but try it anyway. Just leave it unplugged for now -
you have the air bypass and the coldstart injector
disabled anyway.

Can it be not heat related, but related to something
you do differently when it is warmed up? For instance,
you never get ove X-rpms until it gets warmed up? Are
the flaps opening causing something else to occur,
like shorting a misplaced wire? Is it possible that
the fuel return line (the right side of the engine -
to the pressure regulator - and from the forward side
of the regulator to the tank) could be kinking or that
it could have a flap inside that doesn't close off
until after it's run a bit - thus causing fuel
pressure to go sky-high until the engine's been shut
down for half an hour and the flap un-does itself?  (A
flap inside a deteriorating hose is common.) 

It may be a good time to mention replacing all
flexible lines in the fuel supply and return. You have
4,000mi on a rebuilt engine. Did the hoses all get
replaced when the engine was out? That is what causes
our buses to burn. A crack develops and when fuel
pressure is up, it sprays high pressure fuel into
engine compartment where a bad spark plug wire or even
a distributor in normal working condition can ignite
it. Pump keeps feeding...  It may not be a good time
to mention it, cuz you've got that frustrating problem
- but it could be related and it could be a danger to
you &amp; family. Still not heat related but could be
run-time related.

I'm really running out of material here! Somebody has
to come up with something we've all overlooked!

You really need to stick a fuel pressure gauge on
there to see what the pressure is when the problem
occurs. They aren't expensive and they just attach to
the nipple between #3&amp;#4 cylinders with a short hose
and a couple hose clamps. Drive with it on there and
when the prob happens, as soon as you safely can do
so, go back and check. You don't need to keep it
running although that would be a plus.

If you want to send me a personal e-mail with a
mailing address, I'll loan you mine.

A multitester with ohmmeter and continuity tester /
buzzer can be had for under $20 usually at auto parts
stores or electrnics stores. The expensive ones are
more accurate, but for this work all you need to know
is if you're in the ballpark.

I won't be driving to Iowa soon unless the big
earthquake hits Seattle and I ride the wave east! -BaH
