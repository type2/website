&gt; Hey all,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm looking at the Bently manual for adjusting the valves.  They say
&gt; adjust number 1, roll the engine to number 2 and adjust it, roll the
&gt; engine to number 3, etc,etc.
&gt; 
&gt; My question is, can I roll number 1 to TDC and adjust 1 AND 3 at
&gt; the same time then rull up number 2 and adjust 2 and 4 at the same time?
&gt; 
&gt; Seems like I SHOULD be able to do this.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Mark

Mark:
Does your engine fire number 1 and 3 at the same time? Mine doesn't.
Bear in mind that it takes 2 complete turns to complete a cycle- the
camshaft turns at 1/2 crank speed.
The book also says back up to #2, back up to #3, Etc.
