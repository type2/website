Subject: Re: [T2] CDI / Distributor Selection

Well, I'm pretty much sold on the CDI, but I need to get the puchase 
approval from my S.O.  I'm just trying to figure out

1.  What are all of the parts I will need
2.  Which distributor should I use.

The engine is otherwise stock (well, it has a free flow exhaust but 
I'm not sure how long that's going to last) and I don't plan any 
performance enhancements (carbs, cams, etc).

As far as the Universal Corp. CDI, the Mallory is pretty much the 
same price _at_ aircooled_dot_net.  It appears to be a newer version, but 
I'm not sure exactly when they started production.

&gt;
&gt;$125 Universal Corp. CDI box on all my aircooled rides ('72 bus 
&gt;w/2260 T4, '73 bus w/2055 T4, '73 914 w/1.7L, and the wife's '69 KG 
&gt;with 1776).  Worth every penny - the buses in general went from 
&gt;using the better part of 3/4 tank per week on the M-F slog to only 
&gt;using around 1/2 tank, the 914 (w/ dual 36 Dells) used to score 35 
&gt;mpg on L.A. to El Paso runs, and the KG gets better mileage with a 
&gt;hipo 1776 + 36 Dells than it did with a bone stock 1600 SP 
&gt;motor...  You need to regap the plugs from stock to &quot;about&quot; .045&quot;, 
&gt;else you NEVER see the improvment and that's the critical step the 
&gt;luddites commonly miss, so you will hear stories about CDI not doing 
&gt;cr*p for some...  Dig deeper and you'll find out why ;-)
