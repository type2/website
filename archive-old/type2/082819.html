Subject: Re: [VB] pit

I think a lift would be more cost effective and useful.  There are lifts
as cheap as $1800 - you probably ca't do a proper pit for that, and you can't
take your drivetrain and suspenion out with a pit.  I'm researching lift
options right now for the 2nd garage I want to build.

Just my .02

&gt; I am thinking about building a barn to put my VW stuff and a couple of
&gt; busses in. It seems to me this would be a good time to dig a &quot;pit&quot; to be
&gt; able to stand and work rather than work on my back on the floor. Anyone know
&gt; how deep to dig the thing or have any other input?
