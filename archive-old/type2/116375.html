Subject: Donations

Hi Volks, and a word about donations. My name is Ted Finesman (TBear or
the &quot;cherry guy&quot;) and I am the list treasurer.  The monthly ISP fees for
type2_dot_com are paid strictly through donations from all of you.  The
donations have ranged from $1.00 to $200.00, the average being about
$20.00. The list expenses are $160.00 per month.

I got this brilliant (?) idea (actually my wife did) that I clean out the
garage and get rid of all the treasures buried there.  I decided that she
was right and since I'm not a real good salesman, I decided to donate all
the money _I_ made to the list.  I found that people thought _they_ had to
donate to the list to take advantage of some of the stuff I was getting
rid of.  That is not the case and I am sorry if it appeared like that.

To be clear, the list donation policy is:

    DONATIONS ARE NEVER REQUIRED TO BELONG TO THE LIST

The list is FREE and the information shared freely. It is true that the
list is supported by your generosity.

BTW, the type2 list raised $78.00 and the FMBC gets $46.00 from the stuff
I sold.  (And my wife is pissed that I had to bring a box home.)

Ted
