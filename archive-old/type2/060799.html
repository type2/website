&gt; Another thing to think about: California has the strictest

&gt; off, no headlights, wipers, bald tires, no turn signals, cracked

Not precisely true.  We don't have inspections, but it is still
illegal to drive with the unsafe conditions listed above.  Cops write
quite a few tickets for equipment violations.

Personally, I like it this way.  It goes back to the concept of being
innocent until proven guilty.  I'd resent having to go in every year
to prove to someone that my bus is &quot;innocent&quot; and is in good repair.

I'd be really PO'd if some inspector dinged me for having a 1/4 inch
rock chip in my windshield.  No safety problem by any stretch of the
imagination, but technically it would require replacement in states
that require perfect windshields.

Seems to me that the safety inspection laws could be called the &quot;Auto
Mechanics Relief Act!&quot;
