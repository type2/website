Subject: RE: [T2] Seats from Vanagon in Late Bay

&gt; Anyone have experience putting vanagon (or any other) seats with
&gt; armrests in their late bay? What modifications if any are required?
&gt;I have a 76 westy with the swivel passenger seat.


The Bus seat tracks were changed sometime in '76, if my memory serves me
correctly (which it doesn't always do... could be '75...).  The Vanagon
seats will fit directly into a Bus with the later style seat tracks.
However, if you use a Vanagon GL seat (which has armrests), you may have
trouble getting the outside armrest to clear the door (certainly on a Westy,
not sure about a passenger bus). Fortunately the armrest can be removed if
desired.
