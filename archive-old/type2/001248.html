Hey Everybody,

There is a gentleman who is considering buying my 71 Weekender. He wants to
tow it behind his motor home when he and his wife travel. He says he needs
to know the weight of the bus without passengers and cargo. He also needs to
know, and he is researching this too, if the tow bar is capable of towing
the bus. He checked the tire size (195 R14) to see if it will fit the tow
bar. Has anyone trailed a bus before? Has weight been a factor? Is a
hardtop Westy even capable of being towed long distances? Is the frame and
front end strong enough? What other things should be taken into
consideration? Any help in this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Bill
