&gt; I really do try not to be negative - especially in a public forum but I
&gt; think this needs to be said about Ron and Old volks home.
&gt;
&gt; Perhaps things have changed since this happened to us over a year or so
&gt; ago but just  be forewarned.
&gt;
&gt; Sorry for the negativity on this really positive and helpful list but I
&gt; though Nikki and others considering doing business with Ron should know
&gt; this.  I had done business prior to this incident with him without any
&gt; problems.   Ut now, I would think twice before working with him again.

Adam and other listmembers,
I think it should be clarified who we are all talking about when we talk
about Old Volks Home.  Not so long ago there was a gentleman on the list
named Jim Thompson who had a VW parts business called the Old Volks Home and
a web site at http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com  This is who I believe Nikki was
speaking of.  Last I heard Jim took his business on the road and you may see
him at various shows.  Jim also put up some good tech information,
especially a nice list of just about every air-cooled VW distributor and its
specs.

More recently Ronnie has set up a business under the Old Volks Home name
with the web site http://www.oldvolks_dot_com.  As far as I can tell, this
business is in no way associated with the original Old Volks Home run by Jim
Thompson.  Someone correct me if I am wrong.
