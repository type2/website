Whats the easiest way to determine when to adjust the valves. I've put a
mark 180 degrees from tdc and followed his proceedure to the letter, but the
valves arent open to adjust.
Help please

Matthew~~
Matt,
  I'm a little unclear about what is amiss for you here, by your description. 
  First, your valves should be adjusted right along with all the other tune-up
ditties, every 3,000 miles.
  Second, did you have a friend helping you? Did you line up your rotor, TDC,
et all? You got to where you oughtta be firing at #1 cylinder, yes? And you
say the valves didn't open? Do it again, from the beginning, and lay under
that right side and *watch* your #1 valves move as the engine is hand-cranked
COUNTERCLOCKWISE. You'll see it move with the engine.
  Now, if you mean that you did all that and couldn't get your feeler gauge in
there, then it's just too tight! Did ya try the .004 blade? Try that and
you'll *know* it's too tight! Then just get your 13mm (or 14mm) and loosen
that locking nut (go easy, knuckles beware), and then with your screwdriver,
turn the slot to the left to widen that gap until you can get your .006 in
there.
  Be mindful: if you aren't able to turn the slot there because the locking
nut is turning with it, then you need to work those two apart first by holding
still the locking nut and turning the slot w/ your screwdriver the loose way,
like that, until they both do their job.
  Again, have help there, reading the procedure to you. I think Muir covers
all these possibilities. Don't skip any parts and he'll talk you through.
  I just did my valve adj. for the first time last w/e, so it's fresh still
and I'd be happy to help you out s'more if you need it still!
  Good luck, and savor that self-empowered feeling when your done! Oh! Hey,
and do *not* forget to say &quot;OLE!!&quot; when you're done!!
  By the by, check your gaskets there. I thought mine were fine and they were
NOT!
Good luck,
