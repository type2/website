Subject: Re: [T2] Putting a 1600cc into a 73

Even with a type 4 engine, a
&gt;bus is no rocket.
&gt;

Heh. Mine will be. I had a drag bug I am going to sell, but I will keep the 
engine. By my calculations I will have a 250 hp bus by spring. Yes its a 
racing bus. On the other hand, I have noticed that the more power I put into 
the bus, the less I enjoy just driving. The many (and its many) buses I have 
owned, I enjoyed the 1600 the best, you will get there, maybe a little 
slower, and maybe a bit safer, and you watch the scenery and enjoy the ride.

Sure you climb the hills in third gear but its just good fun. I find myself 
taking pleasure in enjoying the journey, rather then trying to get to the 
destination. My 63 was a great example of &quot;enjoying the ride&quot;.
