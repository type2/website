Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Timing TDC

I had an engine that had the timing gear installed incorrectly.  This 
meant that the rotor was pointing in the opposite direction of the 
marking on the distributor when it was supposed to fire #1.  I had to 
swap the wires on the cap to make it run correctly.  Not *that* big of a 
deal, but it'll throw you if you don't remember that it's flipped.

&gt; Good call mike. But wether the drive is off or 180 backward, wouldn't it 
&gt; still point to the #1 wire?
&gt; Granted I would say only use this if your bus is running decently and 
&gt; you are just doing a valve adjustment.
