Subject: O2 Sensor Problem, 1980 Westfalia Vanagon.

My mechanic and I have been working on my engine temp problem which I 
didn't have by the way until I installed my CHT gauge.  Oil temp appears to 
be running high also at 230 to 300 at 70 Fahrenheit and about 240 cruising 
at 60mph.

Suspecting that maybe my engine was running too lean and therefore hot we 
started checking.  We found with the o2 sensor connected the system, it was 
too lean at 2000 plus rpm but correct at idle.  Disconnected it is much 
richer and almost out of spec at high rpm's, but in spec at idle.  We have 
tried a new O2 sensor with no change and checked everything else according 
to Bentley with all parts checking out in spec.  Here is my mechanics 
explanation.  He is by the way a very reputable, knowledgeable mechanic in 
my opinion here in Santa Barbara County, and has been extremely pro-active 
in solving this mystery:

When co is set to factory spec. by the book you disconnect o2 sensor with 
engine off, start engine and adjust as necessary then shut off reconnect o2 
restart engine and recheck co, it should stay with in spec.  If not other 
causes of this problem could be a vac leak, timing, fuel psi, fuel 
injector, and head sensor, which all check good. Your co goes too lean at 
cruise speeds, I have herd of other shops installing a resister in the o2 
wire connector to bring the co back to spec with all systems operating. We 
need some leads on the resister or if this is due to something in the 
electronics we may be missing. Note this is a California version with 
electronic ignition and o2 sensor system. most other models have points and 
no o2.

1980 Westfalia Vanagon FI all stock engine.

Any idea's list?

FYI: I posted a similar message to the Vanagon list last evening and am 
getting no help so far.
