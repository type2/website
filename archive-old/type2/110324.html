Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch cable

&lt;&lt; Man- Look at CIP's website. They only list 2 sizes, one for early and one

for late, and they don't correlate to those sizes. Maybe that's why you hear

so many complaints about cables being too long. They've cut it down to 2

generic lengths that aren't really right for anything? Tom

From the pre-internet it'll get you home but no further files:
A too long cable can be shortened enough to get you home...
You need a &quot;brake cable shortener&quot; (and don't ask if they're
still available)...Years ago my cable snapped and I really didn't
want to drive through NYC without a clutch (too many stops).
I had another with me that I thought was the right one but was
too long...I found a small auto parts joint with the aforementioned
&quot;brake cable shortener&quot; a metal &quot;Y&quot; with a threaded hook that puts
a tensioned kink in the cable to shorten it. It was just enough to
use the wing nut to adjust the clutch...
