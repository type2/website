Subject: Qu re hard shifting after tranny rebuild

Got 78 Westy back today- all good except shifting with rebuilt Tranny , 
new bushings in shift rod end, shift lever left alone.
Pull it to the left and up from neutral to go to first and it &quot;hangs&quot; 
(never wants to go to first- almost like it's overturning the rod 
towards reverse?).  3/4 gears OK, further right than I am used to, and 
it takes more &quot;ummph&quot; as though a spring is resisting.
1st you feel is very close to 3 (in fact going to 3 I clashed the gears 
sometimes as it was trying to go to first). Goes to second from 1st with 
a reluctant give as though it is hanging before it goes.  The mechanic 
said it was due to a very tight tranny and a sloppy (worn) front 
shifter, and an EMPI would fix it all, as it is a much better shifter. 
(old one had bushing gone in nose cone, but it shifted OK!)  We cleaned 
up and greased the shifter end and socket, reset the plate- slightly 
better but I would not want to be stuck in traffic with it- any 
suggestions- IE, will an EMPI shifter make such a differernce?
