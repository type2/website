&gt;So there seems to be no shortage of disreputable vendors out 
&gt;there, I would like to know who people have been happy with for 
&gt;rebuilt engines and specifically transaxles for pre 67' busses.
&gt;I would like to hear people's recommendations.
&gt;
&gt;m.
&gt;
I have personally had good luck with AVP in Sacramento for motors 
and heads, and am curious whether others have had any experience 
with them.  I have heard good things about Transform and Carters 
Gearbox Shop(?) for transaxles, but have not used them personally.
