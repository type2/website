Subject: oil spewing on a 1600 
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.LNX.3.91.981225085836.7706A-100000-100000_at_bigkitty.azaccess_dot_com&gt;

Howdy all - while batting along like, well... a bat, i stopped at a gas
station and checked the engine room. all was fine tempwise, but there were
spots of oil on various bits. spots seemed heaviest on right side (fif),
small puddle under the pulley, LOTS of oil near and under the pressure
sender. i THINK that i have a small crack in the case (too much torque w
hile screwing in sender), and it is shooting out a highpressure jet of
oil, some of which is striking the pulley and being flung across the
engine compartment. i'm asking the list if there is anything else i should
check, just to be sure... oil cooler is not leaking; pulley seal MIGHT be
suspect, but seems unlikely; mebbe the gaspump or distro are not set
firmly, blahblahblah. whatever it is, it doesn't seem to be affecting much
- bus runs at 3600 rpm, 65 mph, 350 head temp, 180 oil. 

PLEASE respond to soundex_at_eden_dot_com, and have a happy holiday!
