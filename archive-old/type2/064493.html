Subject: re: FS: '75 Westy Poptop, $5885

Sheesh, i had no idea i'd create such a stir.

Anyway, in part FYI and part to help make myself not look like such a 
moron, i thought i might share this solid fact:

In TODAY'S Rocky Mountain News there are 19 VW buses for sale (not 
including Eurovans). There is only one van under $2000. It's $995 and 
sounds like a heap. There are a few in the $2000 and $3000 range. Most of 
the vans are in the high $4000 and low $5000. However, there are a few at 
$6000, $7000, and $8000. The most expensive one is going for $10,050. The 
years on these range from '62 to '85.

And yes, i've had a mechanic do all my work. It ain't cheap! But i do not 
have the time to make this into a hobby like a lot of people seem to. 
There's no way i can waste entire days driving from junkyard to junkyard 
looking for parts and such. And i won't even tell you what i had to pay 
for the new door hinge (shipped from Germany). It's embarrassing, and 
you'd all laugh me right off the net.

Anyway, i've decided that i'll take the best offer on the 73 westfalia. 
At this point that would appear to be $4500. Let me know if you're 
interested.
