Subject: Type4 distributor question:

I have finally gotten around to troubleshooting the old 77 bus that quit 
a couple of months back while the kid was driving it. The bus had been 
acquired a couple weeks before and hadn't yet done a tune-up, oil change 
or other mandatory servicing prior to him drive it.

The symptoms, when it gave up the ghost:  Shifting from 2nd to 3rd, it 
backfired (it blew the muffler apart from the clamp and pipe), let out  
a huge puff of black smoke, quit and persistently refusad to restart. I 
had at the time assumed an eaten valve or such, but didnt have time 
until now to get into it.

While recharging the battery out of the rig, (I read in Idiots that one 
should not jump start a fuel injected motor) I started with the basics 
of troubleshooting I checked the points, cap and rotor. Satisfactory 
gap. However, and now I'll finally get to the question.....

The distributor rotor shaft turns around by hand. In fact, it lightly 
&quot;snaps&quot; into &quot;place&quot; every 180 degrees. This does not happen with my T1 
motor's distributor - the shaft only turns when the starter turns it.

Is this normal, and if not, what is wrong?? bad Dist? broken cam? 
stripped distributor gear???

Tomorrow the battery should be up to full charge and can tell if it 
turns over and the rotor  turns when the motor turns over.

help..

Joe
