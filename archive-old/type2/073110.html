The mysterious 'Silver Socket'

The 'silver socket' is a European-style auto accessory outlet. It was
installed in all '74 - '84 Westfalia campers imported into the U.S.
According to Ronald Turner, the '74 and '75 Westies came with a small air
compressor that used this socket. (The spare in those years came deflated!)

A plug which fits this socket is available from Hella (for about $12.) You
can wire this plug into 12 volt accessories that you wish to use with the
socket. You can also get a plug for these sockets from BMW motorcycle
dealers (for between $10 and $35 - shop around!) They're used on BMW
motorcycles to power heated vests.

The Trim Shop (which specializes in selling stuff for type 181 VW Things)
has a herd of accessories which plug in to this socket. They're located in
Phoenix, Arizona, and their phone number is 800.966.7791.

&gt;Hi Listees,
&gt;
&gt;In searching the 1980 westy archives I have repeatedly stumbled upon the
&gt;mystery of the brushed aluminum ring located on the dash to the left of the
&gt;heater controls...does anyone know the meaning of this?  Its beginning to
&gt;keep me up at night.


HTH Karl.
