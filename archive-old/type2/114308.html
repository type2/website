Bob,
We have to work on your sentence structure. :-)
In your statement above, you put a comma after GEX rather than a 
period.  Thereby lumping the relatively small handful of excellent 
rebuilders in with GEX.

The paragraph should have read

Stay away from GEX!

The ones that have the best references on this list are Boston Bob, AVP, 
and Seattle something or other (Doc Tim?) .

I would extend my complete recommendation for Boston Bob  (Bob Donalds) of 
Boston Engine Exchange.
Very fair, very knowledgeble and excellent work.
