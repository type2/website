Subject: Weld wire q's

Hi list, 

Trying to learn to weld and need help. I cannot buy weld wire locally that
is flux less, i.e. MIG wire that you use with gas. I can only get the flux
core stuff. Don't ask.... I live in weirdsville :0)
Anyway, if I use flux core wire *and* argon/co2 shielding gas will I get
any benefit from the gas?

Also, should I get a weld puddle on both sides of the work, or is my
setting too hot?

Cheers

Darren
