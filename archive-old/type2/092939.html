Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Cooler Cleaning?

And blow the gunk back out of the oil cooler - not forcing it through the 
cooler.

On a Type IV I mean blow it upwards not down.

Certainly worth the .50 cents or buck that the car wash charges.

&gt;I doubt that cleaning out the oil cooler will provide you with lower oil
&gt;temps. Your temps are most likely rising due to engine wear.
&gt;------------------------------------
&gt;Get with the program, they all collect cotton wood seeds, lint and
&gt;general crap on the topside. Might blow some of this away with high
&gt;pressure air or water.
&gt;If you got a small problem today its going to be bigger tomorrow.

Chris
