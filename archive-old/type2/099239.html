&gt; I can't speak specifically to a '77 but I'm assuming it is similar to my
&gt; '70. If so you should find a hose running from the air intake area to a
&gt; drain toward the left. This hose is flimsy and can crack over time allowing
&gt; water into the trough area. This may be the source of your problem.
&gt; I replaced mine with a radiator hose from a local FLAPS.

My '73 has one of those drain hoses.  It's a two-part assembly,
which may become two separate pieces and a puddle of water. :-(
To access this hose, remove the left side kick panel in the
cockpit.  One end's in front of the heater duct 'stove pipe'
and the other end is below the left headlamp bucket... IIRC.
Good luck,
