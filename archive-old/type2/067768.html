&gt;                 The Ultimate Urban Legend
&gt; 
&gt; Craig Shergold is a 10 year old boy who is dying of cancer.  Before he
&gt; dies, he would like to set the world record for receiving the most
&gt; Neiman-Marcus Cookie Recipes.  You can help Craig by sending an irate
&gt; fax to LEXIS-NEXIS demanding that they remove all traces of your
&gt; mother's maiden name from their executive washroom wall.  They will
&gt; respond by sending e-mail labeled &quot;goodtimes&quot; to the computer
&gt; controlling Craig's life support equipment.  When Felippe Linz, the
&gt; technician operating the computer opens this mail, his hard drive will
&gt; be overwritten with thousands of credit card invoices for $250.00,
&gt; erasing the last bit of evidence that Hillary was seen on the grassy
&gt; knoll when JFK was shot, thus allowing world domination by Bill Gates
&gt; and his tri-lateral commission cronies who are eating fried peanut
&gt; butter and banana sandwiches in the black VW Bus with Elvis.
&gt; 
Wait, that bus needs to be in Arizona with a JATO unit on it!
