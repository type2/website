 Found this bus on Broadway at the Cat Hospital. The new paint drew me to take a close look.

No price or year info, but I'm betting 74. Campmobile interior complete,
vinyl mustard upholstery is sliced up (cat claws?) The marker light hole
gave me some access to the battery tray and it seems to not yet be rusted
through. Couldn't tell much more. The bus was backed against a short wall and I couldn't open the engine
compartment.
Looks decent. The paint job is adequate. Not super shiny, but appears to be ok. No bubbles or runs that I
could see in the snow.

I'd dig into it myself but I'm too broke. It would make a good soul-swap for the GWB I think. =)

Well..... the 3rd digit of the vin on top of the dash will tell you the year :)

I am puzzled by the 'vinyl mustard upholstery'.  That was last used by Westfalia in USA buses in the 1972
model year. But the bus you took pics of has square bumpers so it is a 73+. 73 was one-year-only mustard
cloth. 74 was the beginning of the plaids.
