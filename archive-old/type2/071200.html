&gt;  hi all. i'm having an annoying problem with my '77 westy.
&gt;  it is really difficult to get the transmission into first
&gt;  gear. it requires a lot of feeling around and a fair amount
&gt;  of force to get it in. this is sometimes embarrasing at
&gt;  stop signs when i'm sitting there wrestiling with the
&gt;  shifter. i have this problem regardless of whether i'm
&gt;  stopped or rolling. second gear is also a little difficult
&gt;  to get into, but it &quot;snaps&quot; into place much easier than
&gt;  first. third and fourth have no problems at all. does
&gt;  anyone know what these symptoms indicate? since it's both
&gt;  first and second, might there be a problem with one of the
&gt;  synchros? or could this be an issue with the shift rods
&gt;  being out of whack? please don't tell me i have to have the
&gt;  tranny rebuilt.
&gt;  
&gt;  cheers,
&gt;  ben

Hi Ben,

First check the coupler at the rear of the shift rod where it connects to the 
shaft into the gearbox. This looks like half of a universal joint and has two 
rubber blocks in it which cause all sorts of shift problems when they fail.

If that isn't your problem then check for wear on the stop plate at the base 
of the gear stick - access obvious just undo the bolts at the base of the 
gear stick. If its worn it will be obvious with deep gouges in the faces. 
Either replace with a new one or apply a bead of weld and file down to shape.

Good luck
