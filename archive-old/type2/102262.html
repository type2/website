Subject: Re: [T2] I fried 2 starters WHY?

Sounds like you have a dead battery, try starting it
with a big charger connected to the battery, make sure
the battery is fully charged before trying to start
it. I start mine with a booster with no battery, as
long as you keep 12V. to the coil it should keep
running. Watch out for sparks and keep a fire bottle
handy. Phil
