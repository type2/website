Subject: rusto ration

Anybody got an easy solution to preserving the rockers in their
Bus...My driver's side rocker had a bit in the front but the ice 
pick test reveals solid metal on the outside surfaces...I've blown
a lot of rust convertor into the rocker ('til it was dripping out the
weep holes and seams but still...Any off the shelf gadgets to en-
sure that the interior of the rocker is sealed against rust...A four
foot wand to shoot (what ?) into the rocker... ??

What have others done that they've been satisfied with over time...?-)
