You can use sandpaper to rub a washer to adjust it's thickness. You should 
always verify float level with an actual test assembly. Assemble the carb, 
rig a gravity feed of fuel to fill the bowl, remove the top and measure the 
fuel level. Use thinner or thicker washer to adjust if necessary. Float 
level is critical, as are the number of adjustments called for in the 
Bentley. The carburetor sections in Bentley are very thorough.

&gt;The only gasket supplied in the kit however is 1.0 MM thick. Does this really
&gt;make enough difference that I should try to locate a 0.5 MM gasket? When I
&gt;took the carb apart, I noticed that there was no gasket used.
