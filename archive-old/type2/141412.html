Subject: Re: [VB] oil coolers, heat and etc

----- Original Message ----- 
&gt;   lowering the CR is fairly easy - take off the cylinders, and put in
&gt; the appropriate spacers.

You can end up with a motor that runs hotter this way too, believe it or
not.

If you raise your deckheight more than .060&quot;, you start loosing the benefit
of the squish factor. After your deckheight is much over .100&quot;, it's all but
gone.

The ideal way to do it is to keep the deck height between .040&quot; and .060&quot;
and open the combustion chamber a bit to gain the extra cc's IMHO.

My 63 drag bug (12.2:1 CR)  has a deck height of .043&quot; and can run on 91
octane without pinging. If I did nothing more than open the deckheight up
with some spacers to lower the compression, it would start pinging like a
mad-man.
