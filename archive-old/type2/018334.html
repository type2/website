Subject: TGIF: VW Bus in Popular Music?
Message-ID: &lt;375795AE.5F9F4FAC_at_gmx_dot_de&gt;

Hi Volks,

I'm on the quest for pop music that somehow relates to
the VW Bus.  This is out of interest, but also for use
in the VW Bus Museum I'm a member of.

There are four &quot;categories&quot; into which such music might
fall:

1. A VW Bus is featured in both lyrics and video.

Naturally the most desirable category.  One example is
Men at Work's &quot;Down Under&quot;, which starts with the line
&quot;Travelling in a fired-out Kombi&quot;, and features the
Kombi in question in the video clip too.

2. A VW Bus is featured in the video.

I know no examples... yet.  But these would be very
interesting to know.

3. A VW Bus is featured in the lyrics, unambiguously.

This would mean that the lyrics contain &quot;VW Bus&quot;,
&quot;Splitty&quot;, &quot;Westy&quot; or any other of those VW Bus 
specific terms.

4. The lyrics can be understood as referring to a 
   VW Bus, even if they really don't.

An example would be Paul Simon's &quot;Ace in the Hole&quot;,
containing the following: &quot;Riding on this rolling Bus /
Beneath a stony sky&quot;; even though we know from the
&quot;One-trick Pony&quot; movie that the &quot;Bus&quot; referred to was 
a Detroit product, the song doesn't say so.

Please reply via p-mail, unless you have a vague
recollection that other listees might be able to 
clarify.  But even then, let's keep it limited to
Friday!

I'll post a results digest next week on Friday.

Airhowlingly yours,
    Erik.
