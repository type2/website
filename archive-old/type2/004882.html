Subject: Re: [T2] type2 price question



&gt; im curious....am i likely to find a type 2 camper in good shape (minimal/no
&gt; rust, no rot, mechanically sound, reasonably non-dented, heater works, etc)
&gt; for under $2000? is $2500 more like it? im particularly interested in 78 and
&gt; 79 models w/ poptop.
&gt;
&gt; my first foray into the land of camper classifieds online has not turned up
&gt; much in the way of bargains. what i have found are vague ads without pix.

It would REALLY help if you would say where you are.
Here in Calif. I can get you a decent no-rust deluxe 79 Westy in the 2000 to
2500 range but if you lived on the East coast, transportation will cost as much
if not more.
Where are you??
