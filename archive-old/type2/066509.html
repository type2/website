&gt;could have been used again and again, ala the Fitzpatrick method, learned
&gt;what I could and simply enjoy the camper to the degree of perfection that I
&gt;was to achieve. Thom on the other hand is totally outta control IMHO ;-).

I won't rise to the occasion, but I'll slide over to it...

I never intended the '56 to be a show winner; I set out to create a bus to
drive to work every day and to take surfing on the weekends (Arizona: lotta
beach, no water)  I made a lot of mistakes along the way, putting the
project way over budget, but even with its flaws, I get a lot of
compliments, mostly from the &quot;unsophisticated&quot; bus lovers.  The Charlie
Hamills and such pan my bus as being &quot;custom&quot; and &quot;non-original.&quot;  Screw-em.

The '54, on the other hand, is going to be somewhat closer to the RFH, but
even then lines will be drawn in the sand.  I think one of them already is
the $3k+ this guy in LA wants to do the interior...
