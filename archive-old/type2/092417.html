Subject: Charging problems?

Hi,

Today I installed the ammeter and I observed the following right after 
installation:

1) Everything off, the needle was right on 0
2) Lights on with engine off, the needle deflected to the negative side
3) Engine running with all electrical loads off, the needles is on 0, went 
positive when
I reved-up the engine. I turned on the lights and radio and it went to the 
negative side

Then I start to drive and the needle was on the negative side, deflecting 
more when
accelerating, until I stop at a red light. The needle went to the positive 
side and suddenly
jumped to +60Amps! Like there is a short circuit but charging! I depress 
the accelerator
and the needle went back to 0 on the negative side.

Does anybody have an idea what might be wrong?

Thanks a lot,
Rogelio
