Subject: Zapppppppp!!! electric clothes

Hello,
Re: BMW motorcycle clothing

Yes, you can use electric motorcycle clothing to TRY to keep warm in a van.  I did it on a very cold trip from northern Pennsylvania to Daytona some years ago during February.  Unfortunately I only had two vests and not a vest and pants. This made for some cold spots!  It did help because I'm sure I would have frozen to death otherwise.

I can't help but believe that there are other 12v. warming devices out there that can be adapted.  The whole business was cumbersome.  It was ok for suiting up and driving out tankfulls of gas but not so good for around town.  The alternators on the newer type 2s should be more than adequate for the task.

Good luck.
Drew
