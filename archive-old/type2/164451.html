Grrrrrrhhhh



The thing is still leaking like crazy. Turns out the main seal at the front
of the engine is gone.



I could do it tonight, but the wife would question it.



Thanks all for the advice.



You are all amazing at your responses, it is like having a mechanic right

Again, thanks to all.



Alan
