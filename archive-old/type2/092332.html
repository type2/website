Subject: Bad intake valve

Can one cylinder be made in-operative?

I know Vw engine have been made to run on 2 cylinders......

I have a  2.0L fuel inj. hydraulic lifter engine in a '76 Camper here,,, he
wants to drive it a few thousand miles before he drops the engine to repair it.

So, I thought I'd ask the list for positive comments about disabling one
cylinder

I know the bad things about driving with a dropped valve seat, burned valve,,
but I have personal experience that says it is possible to drive a few thousand
miles home to a place you can repair it and save money, and time.  

Presently....
This engine has ZERO compression on #3 ,,  130 psi on the other 4,  my gauge is
working fine now thanks! :p
leak down indicates intake valve, with ZERO back pressure,
Not low,, but ZERO compression psi, and zero leakdown back pressure in #3 only.
It must be BAD!

The valve stem at the rocker adjuster is the same height as the other 3 in the
head,, telling me that it must *not* be a sunken seat 
I am guessing that it is a burned valve/seat....   sound right?

in the past I have had discussions about making the bad cylinder in-operative,,,
and I have always said,,, it is a waste of time.  Just drive it and adjust the
valve lash every morning!  
I have heard some good points about trying to disable the one cylinder,, but
have never thought it would make any difference.  
This problem causes the entire intake system to be out of whack!

I propose to remove the intake pushrod so it does not move and the intake valve
will stay closed,,
tighten the exhaust valve rocker so it does not allow the exhaust valve to close
remove the injector wires so it does not get fuel, 
and ground the spark plug wire so it does not spark.
No fuel, no spark,, therefore no heat , and hopefully no reason for the valve
head to pop off. Or the seat to disintegrate

I hoped to stop the entire intake system from being disrupted from the
compression blowing back past the intake valve,,, by allowing it an easier path
out the exhaust system past the open exhaust valve.

I was thinking of making both valves inoperative,, and leaving the spark plug
out of the head to vent the compression out of the engine rather than back into
the intake,,, but I am afraid it will draw dirt in and damage the piston and
cylinder,, 
I thought of using a fitting screwed into the spark plug hole and a short hose
with a crankcase style of filter like a chev, on it to allow the cylinder to
vent, but not draw in dirt.
Keeping the exhaust valve from seating will allow the air to escape there, and
the only air drawn in the cylinder will have to come past that intake valve that
is closed,, and leaking,, and I assume it will also get air from the exhaust
system,,,

Well,,, is this a silly Idea?  Could it work?  

Should I try it? is the big question,,, and the only bad reason I could come up
with is the clearance between the top of the piston, and the exhaust valve that
I jury rig to stay open.

Life is an experiment!
