Subject: [T2] Mexican rear hatch &amp; sliding door seals

Anybody tried any of these out?  I saw them in the Bus Depot catalog for 
about 1/2 the cost of the German seals.  Just wondering about the quality, 
as I tend to drive on gravel roads quite often and get an inordinate amount 
of dust coming thru the back seal (not to say that any seal will completely 
prevent dust coming in, but one could be better than another).

Thanks.
