Subject: evaporative cooling

&gt; Around the same time I got ahold of some information from the
&gt;National Renewable Resources Lab (URL at my home page) about using
&gt;evaporative cooling in humid environments. If someone has time, desire, and
&gt;a little manufacturing know-how, a workable system might be designed. I
&gt;have all but time... A company already markets these type of systems, but
&gt;they make them for *real* busses, not our little ol VW's. Someday I may
&gt;have the time, but if someone else wanted to do the hard work, I wouldn't
&gt;complain...   ;-)

FWIW, our '71, which was modified for camping by a PO, came outfitted with
something called a Pla-Cool, which was an evaporative or &quot;swamp&quot; cooler. As
air was sucked in through a fan cut in the roof, it was cooled by water
pumped up from a five gal. plastic bottle under the sink.

It looked a little kludgey to me -- the system required another fuse,
installed in the engine compt. --  and I didn't trust the plastic water
lines, so I never used it. But I bet a Camping-World type place would have
info on whether Pla-Cools are still made and installable in buses. I've
occasionally seen them on other vans.

In fact, the fan is still there in the roof (giving our bus a homely but
dignified aspect), and I may try to revive it some day...
