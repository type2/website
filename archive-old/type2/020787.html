Subject: Why would radio go off when brakes go on?

Why would the radio blink off and then back on when I apply the brakes?

Is it a voltage regulator problem? My charging system seems to be working
otherwise--at least the battery never dies and the gen light stays off.

The same thing happens when I turn on the wipers when I'm idling. And I
can prevent it if I rev-up the engine just before applying the brakes
(which usually isn't a very good idea :)

Thanks,
Ted '71 Bus
