Hi Volks,

Mark Hineline suggested:
&gt; Following the lead of the indefatiguable George Lyle, I would be willing 
&gt; to compile a list of 10 or 20 &quot;must&quot; maintenances checks for baywindows, 
&gt; and post it once a week, as George had kindly done with usefuls URLs. 
&gt; Old hands could just delete on sight. Anyone interested?

GOOD idea... but wouldn't monthly or biweekly do for those repeated 
postings?  Or maybe putting them on the type2_dot_com web site 
additionally?  It doesn't matter that much to me though.  But I'd 
love to see that maintenance list.

Yours,
    Erik.
