&lt;&lt; I wonder if this is the guy I saw at the energy fair
 in Madison, Wis in June this year.  I think the bus
 was brown, maybe two tone, and he was from Michigan.
 He gave me a business card from Henderson Bros
 Rustproofing in Midland, Michigan, with his phone
 number penciled on the back (517-879-7330),  I don't
 have his name or any other details, as I lost the
 piece of paper I wrote stuff on, I guess.
 That's all I know about it.
 
 Jim (in Wis)

 75 bus &gt;&gt;

Sounds like the same bus if not the same guy.

I have his card somewhere.  As I recall it was just a thin piece of paper 
with a poor photocopy.

This guy and his bus may be genuine, but as I said, it didn't look like a 
conversion.  So he either does very good work, or he's trying to pull a fast 
one.
