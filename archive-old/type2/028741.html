&gt; I have a 1979 2.0 litre motor in the 1972 bus and it does not have a
&gt; timing scale. I am assuming 1979 motors had them. I have heard
&gt; nothing but bad things about the cheap plastic aftermarket ones so if
&gt; anyone has a stock one sitting around let me know.


I have never heard of a cheap plastic aftermarket timing scale. The genuine
Volkswagen ones are cheap plastic, though, so perhaps that's what you're
thinking of.
