I took out my starter solenoid unit on my 70 westy bus yesterday and found
a screw was out at the end of the solenoid, and that the wire &quot;mesh&quot; at the
bottom end of the solenoid going to the starter was quite frayed.  I am
wondering itf it's worth it, easy, or difficult to work on these things, or
should I invest in another starter solenoid unit for about $65. from the
local auto parts store?
Any one have suggestions? thanks_at_!
