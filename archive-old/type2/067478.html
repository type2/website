Gee, I'm 52, still hearty, don't know about hale though..- only thing is,
I'm more reluctant to slide under the bus; use a creeper more now and drive
the Westy up on those ramps in rear- ever try to drive up TWO sets of ramps
at once (front and back)?  Wouldn't work- I still have to jack up the front
to level the whole thing out....Another thin is, I'd rather drive them than
restore them- patience gets shorter as life does too??
