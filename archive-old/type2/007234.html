Subject: new thermostat needed, advice requested

Hello all,
I need to replace the thermostat in my '78 bus.  Having been underneath with that tin off and the engine cold, I said to myself &quot;Hmm, it shouldn't be fully expanded when the engine is cold, should it?&quot;  Then having seen the picture of a contracted thermostat in Tom Wilson's rebuilding book, I said &quot;No, it shouldn't be like that.&quot;

A lot of folks say &quot;screw the thermostat&quot; (this post is quotation mark friendly) but before anyone writes to me saying that, I want to say that I feel that leaving the thermostat out, while not completely stupid, isn't very smart and I don't need to have my mailbox filled up with BS like that.

So, I will buy and install a new thermostat.  What I'm concerned about is how the cable fits into the thermostat.  Does it thread in?  What exactly goes on there?  Is this a fairly easy procedure (looks like it is -- famous last words)?  Any advice will be appreciated.  Well, almost any advice ;)

Thanks,
Sean

Well, it depends.  Are the sidewalls cracked/checked badly?  Any chunks
missing from the tread?  If no on both, they're *probably* OK, but why
bother?  Are you going to drive *that* much this summer that you're going to
trash your good tires?  Remember, these old nylon pups probably won't handle
all that hot.  Unless I had to use these, I'd leave 'em or give 'em to
somebody who's tires are bald. 

As for the blowout, I'd rather have one on the rear than on the front--you
steer with the front, right?  On Mrs. M. (who is getting a new set of Summit
Trail Climber LT 195/75/14's as I write this) the better tires have been on
the front, not the rear.

&gt;I purchased a parts bus last Feb which has tires on it that are in decent 
&gt;shape as far a tread goes and seem to hold air fine, but they are old.
&gt;I don't know how long they have been sitting (in a field) on this bus but
&gt;I suspect for several years.  They are the old nylon belted type I believe.
&gt;I would like to use them for the rest of the summer and save my &quot;good&quot;
&gt;tire for the winter when I really need them.  I this a totally stupid idea.
&gt;Has anyone had a blow out a 60 mph.  Does the bus handle that OK (like a car)?
&gt;Also is it more important to have good tires on the back or the front as far
&gt;as blow outs go?  
&gt;Thanks,  I will certainly take your responses seriously especially if I am 
&gt;putting myself or others in danger.

I don't believe I said we were going to fabricate such a hose for the filler.
 I did say that we're attempting to bring them in ourselves from either
Germany (expensive, I'm sure) or try to see if the Mexican Buses use the same
hose and get them from there (if they're made there) to see if they're more
reasonable in price.  No news yet, but I'll keep the list posted when it

Hi-
With all this discussion of rust conversion products, thought I'd put 
some of my $.01 in.  Checked with auto paint stores.  They described 
two types of rust conversion products.  One type requires flushing 
with lots of water after a period of time.  The other type one applies 
thin and let dry and then paint over.
2 years ago I used the let-dry type and the rust is coming back in 
some places.  Other places I used the same stuff and it worked well. 
Probably my technique.  However the worst rust location I need to 
work on is in the vertical panel joints in my '80 Westi.  
Any proven techniques for this location?

I've had a 1970 bus for 5 months, and have dealt with the Rabbit Hutch in

They've been in business since the mid-1970s.  They haven't done lots of
work for me, but I was satisfied with what they did.  And when things
aren't too hectic they seem willing to stop and answer questions, trade

Hope this helps.  And if you find a good junkyard, let me know too.

&gt;Right on!  Hopefully other places pick up on this.  I think smog testing is 
&gt;ineffective if you can plan on getting tested.  Here in BC everyone has to 
&gt;get checked every year.

Glen,

I agree. The gentleman on the radio indicated (like you) that the current 
method of testing, in effect, creates a system that makes everyone get 
their car up to spec. every 2 years here in CA. Then from the testing 
point on the car's smog spec. degrades until the next  inspection.

&gt;But you always see cars on the road (not just old vehicles like ours but a 
&gt;fair share of 90's cars too) spewing smoke like they got a guy in the back 
&gt;seat shoveling coal into a furnace.

The funny thing was, as I was listening to the original report on the 
radio and inching along in traffic, some guy in a 3 year old Detroit-iron 
truck (not a diesel) started spewing plumes of smoke right into my 
window. Hmmm, says I. I'll bet that when I get my '76 running to spec. 
it'll beat that guy by a mile. So, I guess what it comes down to is 
personal responsibility, but it takes that goverment impetus to kick our 
butt's in the right direction.

cheers,

Bren

In Calif back in the mid-70's then used to do smog spot checks. The CHP
would set up a road side stand and invite you in. They checked your lites,

tailpipe. What fun.

Hey now,
     Crossed over into OR yesterday, in a rainstorm. A happy note-my hard
work at sealing the engine compartment paid off.  2 hours into driving in the
rain, I popped the back lid, and the engine was still dry and dusty from
yesterday's off road adventures. 
     I forgot to mention in my last trip report that we had our first
mechanical failure of the trip in Fort Bragg. When I got into the bus at
Payless drugs and shut the door, the driver's side rearveiw mirror fell down
and broke. 
     Anyway, the rain continued. And continued. And continued. We checked out
the mailboat rides at Gold Beach, but at $30/ea they were out of our budget
for this trip. We'll do it next time. We got to go through Brookings OR,
where my great grandmother lived, and through Bandon, where my quasi-step-dad
was stationed in the Coast Guard. And of course the scenery was wonderful.
Much like that of PCH in northern CA, where the forests dip down to the
cliffs and the shore, and rocks stick out in defiance of the unrelenting
Pacific surf, to be engulfed at hightide. Beautiful it was, but too wet to
camp. So we headed inland at highway 38, and found a motel just off I5 in
Cottage Grove. It was cheap, and they let us fire up the BBQ in back, so we
could cook up our campfood. And send all my email...   ;-)
     We are now on I5 just north of Eugene, heading for Portland and my
step-sister's residence. From there I will establish a home base to find a
new rearview mirror, and perhaps a few westy knick-nacks from a local
junkyard. Our next stop after Portland should be Tobin &amp; Christa's in
Vancouver, to start off the Crazy  VW Top of the World Tour... Northaward
Ho!!

NO NO NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I have blown a rear tire, on my folks' pickup truck, and didn't even swerve.
However, I know a couple people that have blown front tires, and gone swerving
madly across several lanes of traffic. One was lucky, and didn't hit anything,
the other person lost control completely. Think about it this way- when you
lose a front tire, one wheel slows down VERY quickly, which really pulls hard.
If it's a rear tire, all the momentum will continue to drag it forward, as the
center of mass is in front of the tires. the wheel with the blown tire will
slow down drastically, which can't spin the rear of the vehicle.Also, rear
wheels are fixed facing forward, while front wheels are free to turn. I would
heartily recommend not using questionable tires at all, but if you must, I
would say definately on the rear.

&gt;I believe that naval jelly is some kind of acid  (oxalic???) it causs a
&gt;chemical reaction that converts the ferrous oxide into ferric oxide, this is
&gt;nert. You must have a rusty surface for it to work and as long as the
&gt;reaction goes down to the bare metal you will have no problems.

Naval Jelly contains phosphoric acid, the same acid used in Coca Cola. 
Coke is probably cheaper, and I expect the syrup has a concentration 
pretty close to Naval Jelly.

Christa and I have washed the curtains in our westy twice in as many 
years, with very good results.  It sounds like we have the same curtains 
as you, right down to the colour.

To answer your questions:
1) We machine washed using Woolite (tm) in cold water, and tumbled dry at 
   the lowest heat setting, adding Bounce (tm) for that &quot;Spring-fresh&quot; 
   (tm) scent.
2) We did not notice any shrinkage, but then we didn't do pre- and post-
   wash measurements either.
3) We did not notice any fading.  In fact, they were remarkably brighter 
   afterwards.  Apparently, there was a *lot* of dust and junk in them when 
   we started!

As a footnote, we did notice some very heavy fading of the fabric in a 
vertical &quot;stripe&quot; pattern, suggesting sun fading over the years where the 
folds from the curtain rods exposed/shaded the material from sunlight 
coming through the windows.

In my experience washing the curtains is safe and beneficial.

surely there is a FAQ about rust somewhere.

i tried altavista.digital_dot_com, and got 84 hits for

        FAQ and &quot;rust repair&quot; and auto

and got one extraneous hit.  

        FAQ and rust and repair and auto

got 84 hits.

i'll keep looking, but does one of you have the true pointer?

Subject: 50's Repro vinyl seats.

Howdy all!

I'm just about to lay out a few hundred to redo the seats in my 
'57 bus and '59 singlecab and want to get some input from hopefully a 
few past WCM customers.

They advertise vinyl repros that cover from like '50 to '67.  I don't 
know for sure, but I thought the style of vinyl changed during those 
years from a move solid textured (like is in the back seat of my '57) 
to a more open weaved style (like in a buddy's '64).

I want an accurate repro since this is going to cost quite a bit.  
Maybe Clara or Thom have some advice?  I've heard good things about 
WCM's products.

Thanks!

&gt; And now to my squeak. This one is really puzzling me! It is a high pitched

Ben,

We need more info on the sqeak.  What does it sound like (be 
descriptive).  Is it always present, or do you hear it just over bumps 
(how big?), around corners(how hard?), or when you back on the engine 
feathering the brakes pointing downhill around a left turn on gravel 
roads?  When you're stopped it is there?  What about when you turn the 
steering wheel?  Jump up and down on the front, then the back 
bumper--hear it?  Where does it appear to be coming from?  It it a 
shreik, a squeal, a grinding, a clunk, a whistling, or what?  Is there a 
rhythm to it?  You get the idea.

Tell us the whole story and maybe we can help you.

Tobin

Subject: RE: silver socket on dash

I guess I was lucky (sic) to have owned a '75, since the pump is the one thing I
still use from that Westy.  I learned to hate early fuel injection on The Clone
(it was an orange pop-top, just like jillions of other ones, hence it was dubbed
The Clone by my next-door-camper at the 1982 US Festival in San Bernadino, and
the name stuck).  I really despised that fuel injection when the darn thing
wouldn't start every morning, but when The Clone met its fiery death, that was
the end of my fleeting romance with fuel injection and Bay Windows.  I bought
Sushine, my spartan '64 Westy with a hatch (in 1983) and have had a blissful bus
life since.  I just went and looked at my pump, and the one end plate that is
still on has a VW emblem (the plastic flex hinge gave up the ghost on the other
end), but on further inspection, it is actually a Coleman, though I didn't
notice if it is American or German made, but the cheap construction leads me to
believe that it is American origin.  The Clone also had the full size spare on
the nose, so at the time I owned it the purpose of the pump escaped me, since it
doesn't move enough air for anything but bicycle tires, or topping up full size
tires (its most common use).  Since the plug fits both the silver socket and a
standard cigarette, I can use it on Sunshine and on the Detroit junk my wife is
cursed with ('86 Mustang).

Happy trails,
terry

Subject: Re: Old Tires

I dis agree with both Bill Kennedy and Mike Wright.
Put the bad tires on the rack and get at least good used rubber!

I spun a Toyota 2WD truck into the center wall of westbound Hwy 360 during a
rain storm. Silly me, I thought I'd save a buck or two by not replacing the
rags on the back of the truck. I got caught in one of our semi-decade
downpours. When it rains in the desert it really RAINS! All of a sudden the
rear end flipped out in *front* of me. Hydroplane city! I don't need no new
tires because it NEVER rains in Phoenix. 
Famous last words, I thought as I slid BACKWARDS down about 300 feet of the
center wall with on coming traffic blinking lights and honking at me. What a
helpless feeling trying to perform all of the proper &quot;skid&quot; procedures as
your butt is puckering and time is slowing to a crawl. Somehow, all sound
ceased to exist as well untill the rasping sound of a D A grinder as the
truck ground against the concrete divider. The experience was not due to
&quot;they dont know how to drive in the rain&quot; but in this instance to the
inferior (nearly bald) tires. 
I will never again tempt fate with cheap tires. I advise that others value
their health (and the health of others) enough to do the same. Put the
things on credit or sell furniture before being a tire cheapskate!
