Subject: Re: [T2] [Fwd: headlight &quot;shades&quot;]

According to whipme:

&quot;These headlight accents allow you to use your high beams without
blinding oncoming motorists for safer nighttime or bad-weather driving.
Easy installation. 

Note: Check local laws regarding use.&quot;

Hm...  Wunner why it would draw cop attention.  I mean, it't not like a
&quot;Bad Cop, No Donut&quot; sticker.  Hehe.  I would think the lowrider factor
would be negated on a bus.

Tony, I just MAY have to get the cat eye things, they be pretty kewl,
too.

Well, whipme sez &quot;Choose from stainless steel or chrome-plated (for
67-78 VW Beetles) visors&quot;, but only the chrome appear to be there.

Thanks all, this was fun!  And I learned something.  Snort.
