Subject: Re: warming up the engine ...

        Modern water cooled engines make very little heat at idle, 
electronic fuel injection keeps 'em running hot or cold, so I have
always just started and gone after a second for oil pressure to come
up. Don't do anything exciting until temp rises, but don't sit
and warm up either.
        At idle, a cold engine is having lousy sparks and gasoline
is condensing on the cylinder walls, thinning the oil.

        I start my aircooled, and the choke makes it idle high, and I
let it run maybe 20-30 seconds before driving off. Enough that it
doesn't die, usually, at the first stop sign with is not far
usually. I figure gentle driving raises the oil temperature
and engine temperature more quickly and evenly than sitting at
idle, and it probably better for the engine.

        Your milage may vary :)
