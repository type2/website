Subject: [T2] Stub axle

From: &quot;TR Gesell&quot; &lt;trgesell_at_compuserve_dot_com&gt;

&gt;Sorry to say, but if the brake drum splines actually &gt;stripped, I'd have trouble believing that the stub &gt;axle splines could be in decent shape.

My own experience recently causes me to disagree.

When the stub axles from my passenger side RGB's (splitbus only) ground the inside of my drum velvety smooth it made noises that I assumed could only come from a transmission. Thor's hammer pounding sounds, one after another as each spline in the brake drum was permanently removed. No traces were found.

While begining the teardown, I found the actual culprit as described above. Stub axle splines? 

Beautiful.

They must be harder than hell.
