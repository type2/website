Subject: Re[2]: [T2] Engine/tranny install advice

This is where I'm at now:

No heat exchangers to put the 2x10 under as the engine is sitting in the
cargo bay.

You are correct about the transmission. I can remove that without raising
the bus at all. The tranny that's in there is unknow and has a busted bell
housing. The one pictured lying in my truck is known good so I'm swapping
them out. 

(By the way, when using the pressure wand at the car wash to clean a tranny
you should wear disposable clothing -- a removeable outer layer of skin
comes in handy too. Old CV grease goes wild when hit with a high pressure
stream! http://www.sysmatrix_dot_net/~gvl2/Rivi/DSCF0061b.jpg The photo doesn't
do it justice -- I look like a connect the dots puzzle up close). 

The plan is to bolt the replacement engine and tranny together and install
them as a single unit. Straight up lift.

Someone on the Buskatiers list reminded me of the method I use when working
on my bug. I spaced it out completely when asking the original question.

Get both sides up a &quot;safe&quot; height and on jackstands (&quot;safe&quot; may not be
quite high enough to roll the engine under -- I'm taking off the air
cleaners but not the carbs).  Then, take one rear wheel off and roll the
engine in through the opening.

I probably will go next door (lumber yard) and buy 6' of 4&quot;x4&quot; so I can
span the bus and use the jack just forward of the rear wheels to get up on
stands.
