&gt; I do not understand the mechanics behind the system, obviously the heat

on the front wall?

&gt; Can somebody please give me a couple things to look at to get me
started on this, or maybe explain how it works so I can start unraveling
its mystery in my head?


The mechanics depends upon the year of your bus.  On the '71, the
defrost/foot setting is controlled by a little lever under the dash, but
later models used cables, IIRC.  It's not complicated.  You just have to
trace the cables and figure out which one does what.

It's pretty easy to tell that VW didn't put their best engineers on their
heating system!
