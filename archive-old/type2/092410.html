Subject: water tank removal 

While we're on the subject of water tanks. I'm thinking of refurbishing the 
tank in my '71 Riviera.

Originally it had an electric pump. The pump is not working. I was thinking 
of switching to a hand pump out of a Westy. Not sure if I can find a 
suitable replacement electric pump.

The tank on the Riviera has a funky little clamp on the bottom side to 
drain the tank. Is there some sort of a valve fitting on Westphalias or are 
they the same way? I want to find some sort of inline fitting to drain the 
tank. The clamp thing on there now has made a permanent crease in the hose.

What's the best thing to use for this?
