Subject: Badly Needed - Fuel Pump Cover Seal - Where??

Bummer !
After allowing NewBus to sit at home lonely for 6 months while Casper 
hauled us all over North America, we came home to a fuel pump in NewBus 
that had it's internal filter all varnished up.
This, despite my having put fuel preservative in NewBus prior to our departure.

So, I pulled the lid off of the fuel pump, cleaned the fuel pump's internal 
filter screen, and reassembled same.
Of course, I had to re-use the original cover seal gasket, expecting full 
well that it was beyond it's ability to properly compress and perform a 
sealing function.

I now have the expected small seepage of fuel past the cover seal gasket 
that is noticeable when I rub my finger across the top of the fuel pump cover.

For reference:
Bus: 1970 Westy
Item: Original fuel Pump
Detail of Item: Bentley Book Section 3 on Fuel System, Page 9, Drawing 
Figure 4-3, Item 4 - &quot;Cover Seal&quot;
also, A picture of my bus engine _at_
http://freeweb.pdq_dot_net/perring/newbus2/Engine%20Left%20View.JPG
showing the fuel pump and  the bolt on top that you loosen to gain filter 
access.

Push to shove, I guess I try making a sting gasket out of dental floss or 
something of the such,,,,,,,,,,, duh !?

Can I find this gasket somewhere.
Please let it be available !!
