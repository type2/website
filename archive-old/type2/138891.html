&gt;&gt; i do not think this would ever be a drawback in the real world. It may look
&gt;&gt; this way on paper, but in reality the Mallory will do pretty much anything
&gt;&gt; you need or want it to do as far as the advance curve. The only real
&gt;&gt; shortcoming is that the vacuum advance is only tunable for amount of
&gt;&gt; advance, not when it comes in. but again, there is so much adjustability
&gt;&gt; built in to the Mallory that you will always be able to make it work near
&gt;&gt; perfect for your application.
&gt; 
&gt; What steps did you perform to setup the Mallory for your own bus?


I'll try to remember... It was over 2 years ago.

First of all, my Mallory is a bit odd, it is a dual points model which I
have converted to use a crane optical pickup. It is not the Mallory unilite
model, but is is similar inside, if not identical. The conversion involved
some machine work, but that is another story. I did the crane conversion
because I had the crane setup and it is a very good triggering system,
reliable and robust.

Ok, first of all was to get the total mechanical advance in line. This is
done by moving a stop screw on advance mechanism. The only test for this is
to install the distributor in the vehicle and check for total mechanical
advance. If it is not correct, move the stop screw and recheck. If you wish
to, at this point you can play with the advance springs in the spring kit.
The springs come in a bunch of weights and by using weaker on stringer
springs in various combinations, many types of advance curve is possible.
If one had a distributor test bed machine, it would be easier to finesse
this part. Pulling the distributor and changing the springs is not a big
deal, but it takes time and effort, for sure. I did not experiment with
spring selections at all, frankly I lack the patience for that sort of
thing. I just used the springs that were recommended by people in the know,
which are the grey ones I think. Once I got the right amount of mechanical
advance, I stopped tinkering.

Then I attached the vacuum hose to the canister and added the correct amount
of vacuum advance. Adjusting the vac advance is easy, just insert the allen
key into the nipple and turn it one way or the other. Run the engine, check
advance amount at given rpm, then re-adjust as needed. I probably spent a
half-day or so getting it all sorted out. Installing the crane optical
pickup actually took a lot longer, because I had to manufacture some parts
to make it work.

Hope that helps,
