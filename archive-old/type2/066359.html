Subject: No lights, engine seal and break problems '72 bus

        I have a '72 bus with a '72 bug engine.  The &quot;real&quot; engine was 
replaced by the PO because of a fire.  In the fire repair, the PO put a 
by-pass toggle switch to turn the van on.  My problem now is that I can't get 
the headlights to work right.  When I turn the key, and the alternate start 
switch, Willy (my bus) starts right up, but I can't get the lights on.  After 
several minutes of messing with the key, pushing and pulling and twisting and 
turning and praying, the lights eventually come on, but it is very difficult 
to keep them on.   
        How can I bypass the ignition switch to allow me to run in the early 
dark, without replacing the ignition switch.  I have a 12 point fuse block (12 
fuses).  I do plan to replace the switch, but I need a quick fix.  It gets 
very frustrating just sitting in a running bus, but having no lights.  BTW, 
the running lights work fine, and the windshield wipers will not work unless 
the headlights work. 
        Please help me with this. 
 
Another question -- 
 
        Does anyone have any suggestions on building some kind of whatever to 
make a air seal around my engine.  The '72 bus engine is much smaller than the 
hole for the '72 bus.  I understand the importance of this seal, and I want to 
get it fixed.  BYW, my engine does NOT get overly hot (judging by being able 
to pull out the dipstick after driving it) 
 
One more question (for now) 
 
        Any suggestions on attaching the vacuum assist break line to this bug 
engine.  I don't know what kind of carb I have, but I do have a vacuum advance 
on the distributor, and there is a small unused vacuum attachment point, but 
it is MUCH smaller than the huge vacuum line to the breaks. 
 
 
 
                                                Thank You,
