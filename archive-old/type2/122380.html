&gt; I really wanted glossy black; that way the oil cleanup is easier.
&gt; However, they didn't have the high temp in glossy.

I hope you don't get as much oil as you're expecting. Mine just need a wipe
every now and then to remove the layer of dust and dirt.

&gt; I could probably switch to another paint other than the high temp stuff,
&gt; but ahh, whatever.  Next time I'm just going to send it all off to be
&gt; powder-coated.  

For the visible stuff, normal paint works just fine. For the deflectors by
the cylinders I'd probably use hi-temp.
