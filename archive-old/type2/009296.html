(It's not Friday here in Oz either)

I am a government disability service manager, and have been a policy worker
and administrator in this area for 25 years.

A Volvo gets me to work, but an 82 Vanagon 'Sopru' pop-top camper gets me
away from it.  My last VW van was a 62 pop-top camper, and the 82 still
feels like something designed  by a mechanical engineer not a marketing
program (my favourite put-down of all other cars hah).
