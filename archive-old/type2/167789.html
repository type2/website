Subject: Re: [T2] TGiFGram: chopped splittie

Heather asked:
&gt;when you say water-injection are you referring to
&gt;CIS?  Its a gret conversion, what do you recommend for this conversion?

	Sorry Heather, I'm not familiar with this system.  It 
certainly can't be as cheap as mine, and I make so bold as to hazard 
a guess that it doesn't work any better.  The proprietary WI systems 
I do know something of, J C Whitney &amp; Holley, are IMHO inferior as 
they use transducers &amp; pumps to push water in before the air-cleaner.


Heather then added:
&gt;&quot;Well-behaved women seldom make history.&quot; - Laurel Thatcher Ulrich

	Being as how it's still Friday in backward time-zones, let me 
mention that huge numbers of them have always done so  -  in the way 
lately resented by wimminsLibbers, viz. making possible the work 
visible in public life of famous men e.g  Churchill.
