Subject: My Kid's New 74 Bus

My son bought a 74 Bus off of e-bay.  He has been driving it for about a week.  Apart from some backfiring when it first starts up and cosmetics, its appears to be in good running order.  It came with new carbs, new tires and a year old battery.

Immediate needs to buy or schnore are a passenger side rear view mirror, a rim for the spare tire, and an antenna.

He says he is going to restore it, which will be cool if he does.  I was wondering what you guys would recommend as the top ten list of things to check out and make sure are in working order for an old bus like this.
