Subject: Rear Hatch Adjustment?

Got a 71 Westy , the rear door is not that aligned (about 1/4 space on the
right side, the left that is almost touching the bus) the striker plate on
the door left side is really compressed compared to the right side one, that
one looks almost new. 

Thinking this might be a source for water coming in. Help....Anyone ever
adjusted one to get in more evenly aligned on both sides? 

The Bentley doesn't really explain this.

Thanks,
