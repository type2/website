Dear Christian.

Further to my e-mail, dated 6th July 2001, I have had some further thoughts 
regarding your impending expedition.

A few books and publications which you might it useful to read, are as 
follows :-

Anthony Greenbank, &quot;The Book of Survival&quot;, Wolfe Publishing Ltd., London, 
1967.

Theresa &amp; Jonathan Hewat, &quot;Overland and Beyond&quot;, 5th Edition, ISBN 0 903909 
13 9, Roger Lascelles, London, September 1981.

Expedition Medicine&quot;, Edited by Bent Juel-Jensen, Expedition Advisory 
Centre, 1 Kensington Gore, London, SW6 2AR,  Tel. 01-581 2057 (the code and 
number have changed slightly, so it might now be either 020 7581 2057 or 020 
8581 2057), 1st Revised Edition 1987.

Theresa &amp; Jonathan Hewat, wrote a book of advice and suggestions for 
independent travellers, having circumnavigated the Globe in their 1972 VW 
1700 Type 2 Devon motorcaravan, during the mid-1970s; travelling a total of 
143,305km, over a 3.5 year period; including part of the route, you are 
likely to follow through East Africa.

The medical aspects of expeditions, are often overlooked, but planning for 
the possible medical and dental emergencies, is an important factor. There 
are many viral, bacterial and parasitic deseases, which are endemic in 
Africa. Don't forget the various venomous spiders, arthropods, insects, 
snakes and other reptiles. If you are interested, I can recount details of 
some of them.

Travellers diorhea is also well documented, which may be trivial, but can 
also be deadly. There are many potential causes; most of which can be 
avoided by boiling all drinking water, fully cooking all food, washing fruit 
and vegetables in boiled water, scrupulous hygeine, etc.

My parents (my father is a retired General Medical Practitioner) and I have 
travelled in more than 40 countries, over the past 40+ years and have 
encountered some of these things; mostly in other travellers.

One of our British VW Type 2 Owners' Club members, who sadly died of old age 
about 5 years ago (Arthur Barraclough), corresponded with me and wrote about 
his extensive travels, in the club magazine. Over a period of about 25 
years, he toured 57 countries and 10 deserts, in his modified 1970 VW 1600 
Type 2. After his experiences with a standard 1600 engine, a specially 
prepared, large bore 1600 engine (i.e. 1700cc), he finally upgraded to a 
1976~79 VW 2000 Type 2, engine, which thereafter provided reliable service; 
albeit with enhanced air-filtration and oil cooling. You might be surprised 
at what equipment, Arthur regarded as essential for survival!

On his journeys through Africa, he observed several abandoned and 
canabalised VW Type 2s, plus one Frenchman who had vainly been waiting with 
his van, for 2.5 months, in anticipation of a replacement engine. Abandoned 
vehicles are habitually stripped for spares!

You said you would not need a starting handle, but have you ever suffered 
charging system failure, leading to engine misfire whilst climbing a hill? I 
have! Fortunately, by switching off the headlights (daytime use is 
compulsory in Sweden), I had enough reserve electical voltage, to get to the 
next town, but the battery was almost dead and I had to perform a rolling 
start, in reverse gear, down quite a steep hill. On a quiet, metalled road 
in Sweden, this was possible, but far from ideal. Had the same thing 
happened to me when touring the rutted, hill dirt tracks, near Mbane, in 
Swaziland, in April 1980, I hate to think what the outcome would have been.

Thank you for your reply e-mail, dated, Friday 6th July 2001, acknowledging 
my suggestion regarding the starting handle and kindly consenting to aid me 
in my VW parts quest.

Another suggestion that I would make, is to carry one or more tyre inner 
tubes, tyre levers and a puncture repair outfit, plus a decent jack which 
will not distort or collapse.

From what I have both personally seen and heard of the non-metalled roads of 
Africa, punctured tyres are commonplace. Tubeless tyres may still be 
relatively rare in the hinterland. I would also be inclined to carry two 
spare wheels, rather than only one.

What instrumentation do you have for monitoring  your engine? I would 
recommend as an ABSOLUTE MINIMUM, oil-pressure and oil-temperature gauges. I 
have just written a comprehensive article for the VW Type 2 Owners' Club 
(which may get published eventually!), entitled &quot;Air-cooled Volkswagens: The 
case for supplementary instrumentation&quot;, prompted by my own and other VW 
Type 2 owners' experiences. My own vehicle, presently has 9 supplementary 
gauges.

For hilly, dirt-road conditions, an inclinometer, might also be useful. How 
do you intend to avoid getting lost. Navigating in the wilderness, is often 
far from straight forward. Ethiopia, is very mountainous and most of the 
roads outside the main towns and cities, are merely donkey tracks, which may 
be steep and heavily rutted. Watch out for punctures from thorn bushes! 
Sudan is probably not much better. Mozambique, I'm not sure of!

One thing of which you must be wary, is fuel identity and octane rating, the 
labelling of which can be quite dubious, in some countries. Theresa &amp; 
Joathan Hewat required an immediate engine rebuild, following a single 
fill-up, with low-octane petrol (i.e. gasoline), in South America.

Carry plenty of water in numerous separate 5 or 10 litre containers. You may 
get stranded in hot ( &gt;45 degC in the shade), dry, dusty regions, where 
drinkable water is several days walk away.

You may have been inspired by the Espen Svensen, who managed to complete his 
journey, but there are many foolhardy people who didn't, whose bones are 
still bleaching in the sun. Take care and ensure that you are properly 
equipped to survive a vehicle breakdown or accident and summon help by 
two-way radio, if you cannot repair it yourself.

Which route do you intend to take? There are some countries in Africa, which 
are regarded as dangerous, for white-skinned travelers!

The parts I seek, for my right-hand drive, 1973 VW Type 2, which might be 
available (those I can recall for the moment!) in South Africa, are as 
follows :-

Air-conditioning system for 1972~79 VW 17/18/2000 Type 2.

Left-hand, Sliding door actuated, automatically retracting passenger step, 
complete with all fittings.

Left-hand sliding door, rear, interior, sliding-door lock handle and 
associated mechanism. On the Westfalia Continental, the front lock handle, 
is obstructed by furniture, past which it is awkward to reach.

Extending, rear-view, cab-door mirrors, as fitted to the Jurgens Auto Villa, 
coachbuilt campervan.

White nylon spacers, with 6.3mm riveted brass spade connector, for the 
red-knobbed, dashboard heater control levers (one per vehicle are found on 
the heater-lever pivot shaft, behind the dashboard instrument panel).

Two-speed, electric ventilation booster fans (fit inside steel ventilation 
ducts, above the kickboards in the cab), complete with dashboard switch and 
wiring.

Regards.

&gt;Hello Nigel
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for your email and your suggestions.
&gt;
&gt;A spare starter is one item I don't plan to bring, because it is so heavy
&gt;and a starter failure will not stop us in our tracks, just cause a bit of
&gt;inconvenience.
&gt;
&gt;When I planned this trip in my dreams, I built in my head the ultimate
&gt;go-anywhere VW bus. I planned all sorts of mods to make the bus stronger 
&gt;and
&gt;more reliable, as well as better able to handle bad roads. A crankstart
&gt;handle was definitely on the plan. However, when I realised that I can live
&gt;this dream *NOW*, it was immediately apparent that I had neither the time
&gt;nor the money to make extensive mods to my bus. This would have been a
&gt;problem had I not met Espen Svensen a year ago. He is a young Norwegian who
&gt;drove a completely stock 1959 Kombi from Cape Agulhas to North Cape
&gt;(southernmost point of Africa to northernmost point in Europe). He left 
&gt;with
&gt;almost no tools or parts, very little money, and ordinary passenger car
&gt;tyres on his bus.
&gt;
&gt;Espen inspired me to just trust my bus as it is, which I would not have 
&gt;done
&gt;without his example. While your idea of the crankstart is a great one, time
&gt;and money preclude me from doing it now.
&gt;
&gt;So hold thumbs for us that our starter motor doesn't play up in the next 
&gt;six
&gt;months!
&gt;
&gt;Re your search for bus accessories from around the world, I will gladly 
&gt;give
&gt;you any assistance you need. I intend to return to SA next January, so will
&gt;be able to keep an eye out for anything you want then.  And, if there's
&gt;anything specific you want right now, let me know ... you never know what I
&gt;might find in darkest Afrika!
&gt;
&gt;Meanwhile, I will be updating the vintagebus list regularly on our 
&gt;progress,
&gt;and our website should be online Monday at www.liondreamer_dot_com.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers
&gt;fig
