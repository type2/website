Bob,

There is a body Shutz gun with a wand extension available--just for this
very problem--

The hose can be shoved in anywhere--and just about any product can be
blown in where you want it to go---

Another body shop supply house item--

Later,

TK

not being dense I hope but I have the lowered floor and it has some
2inch square tubes about 6 ft long as part of the floor. they have been
