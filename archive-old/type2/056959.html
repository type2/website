Subject: F.I. conversion to '73 bus

   I put a '81 vanagon engine w/F.I. in my '73 bus (formally had carb),
and have it *almost* running. I was very careful to follow out the wiring
schmatics in both the Hayne's manual for the '81 and the Bentley for the
'73, and am very sure I have the wiring hooked up right. If I turn on the
ignition and manually open the air sensor gate, the fuel pump runs as it
should.
   But, the car won't start. If I pull off the lead that goes to the coil
from the ECU (#1 terminal on ECU), the engine will actually start and run,
more or less. But putting that wire back on the coil and it won't fire up. 
  Anybody got a clue on this.
