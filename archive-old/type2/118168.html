Subject: Re: [T2] a timing versus carburetor dilemma -- dead at idle

Hi,

Do the timing first. Actually, do the valves first. Make sure they 
are correct. During the valve adjustment process you will have 
discovered/learned where top dead center is. Next make sure the 
points are .016. Now turn to motor by hand and watch the dizzy with 
cap off until you are at top dead center for #1 cylinder.  Now turn 
the dizzy so that the #1 cylinder mark lines up with the rotor. If 
everything is done correctly you are not timed for 0 degrees top dead 
center. You may (after the bus is running) have to adjust a few 
degrees depending on what dizzy you are using but the bus should 
start and idle.  Dial in the timing and then look at the carb.

The carb should be last.
