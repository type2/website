Subject: Re: [T2] fall/winter North Carolina oil

It does not appear that we will have a fall or winter. It was almost 
90 degrees here today.

I use Castrol or Penzoil 30w in the winter. Also you are ok with 
20/50 if you like multigrade oil. In the summer I would suggest 
straight 40 or 50 if you can find it.

Happy Lubricating

PS. Are you coming to Oktoberbus next weekend? Great chance to meet 
the NC bus crowd.
