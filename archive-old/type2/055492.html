&gt; .... if i go and buy a mig welder what am i getting myself
&gt; into?  i need to start on my lil bro's 66 westy soon, and have an artistic
&gt; hand, can i do it?  how much do they run for?  what are the brands of
&gt; preference, etc?  any advice would be appreciated.   ...dan morris...

I don't have time to go into details but,

If you have an artistic hand you'll probably be able to learn how to weld.
You might try some classes (day/night) at the local campus metal shop. Some
welding supply places can even help out if you buy your welder there. I highly
reccommend Miller welders. Get one that can use gas for shielding - your welds
will be much better. The place you buy your welder can certainly recommend the
correct type - they usually also sell autobody supplies.
Price - there's cheap $180, and spendy $1200. Depends on how you want to use it. -
maybe build a roof rack too?

You can do it.
