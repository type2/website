Hi,

&gt;   the humble Vanagon never
&gt; likely to attain such status so these are the &quot;last&quot; of the VW buses. 

 Sure they will. Give it another 5-10 years and they'll be collectable.
 Well built, practical, distinctive, maintainable- they are even attractive in a functional, kinda-macho way... All the ingredients for a classic.

Cheers,
              W.
