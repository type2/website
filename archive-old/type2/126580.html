&gt; there is a new solex 35mm dual carburetor kit with electric chokes
&gt; available from SCAT.  Has anyone tried these?  I was thinking about
&gt; buying the kit and replacing my old, worn out  single progressive weber
&gt; on my 74 Westy (2.0L).   Any info would be greatly appreciated.

At least one person on the list has purchased them, but I haven't
heard how that went.

I'm interested as well. Not that I could afford them, but still curious. =D
