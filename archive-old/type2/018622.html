hey.... is anyone in the Springfield Missouri area?  I might be flying
down there in 2 or so weeks and staying with relatives.  I don't want to
stay with them all of the time and I would like to see some busses and
go to junkyards and what not...  if anyone would like a visitor for a
few hours on a couple of days let me know....I don't need to stay with
you.... I just want to see your bus and go to some junkyards and talk VW
in general...

Let me know...
