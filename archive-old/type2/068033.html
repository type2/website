Subject: RPM vs. Torque Specs on 1800cc Pancake Engine?

Bussers,

Getting ready to install new VDO tach in the up-to-now void opening to the
right of the speedo in my 74 Westy.  My main question at this point is the 
specifications for the rpm vs torque for my 1800cc type IV engine.  So far
I
have shifted by ear with no quantitative value to place on the shift
points.
So I'm looking for the point at which increasing RPMs results in a
diminishing
return in torque.

I guess the basic question is:  What RPM do you set the shift pointer to?
