Subject: Re: [T2] I've had it up to my fuel filler neck with gas
  smell....

&gt;&gt;More likely it's leaking from the short hose that connects the pipe to the
tank behind the firewall. Either that, or its coming out the breather system
behind the spare tire well on the driver's side.&lt;&lt;

Is that another thing that requires the firewall to be out? I've seen your 
postings on the breather system, but not sure how to get at those hoses.
