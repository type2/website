Subject: Cutting out

 
        Here it is, my final question, or maybe not....

Sometimes when I am driving along, my van sort of &quot;shuts down&quot;.  It will
idle fine, but under any kind of load, it sort of shuts off.
 
        I was going to try and check fuel pressure, but when we hooked
up the gauge, all the problems went away.  I am guessing its either ignition
or fuel related (no duh, eh?) in that its done this with two different computers
and airflow meters.
 
        My inclination is to make sure its getting fuel, and then maybe
check to see that the injectors are opening, or have someone look
and see if the coil is going haywire.

        Its something of a major problem.  I've been living out of my Van
for the past month, and it kind of really needs to work or I am scrrrwed.
(I really am looking for a place)
 
        I can offer more details privately.  The intermittent nature
is befuddling....

Thanks
MAtt
