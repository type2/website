&gt;What to do?

You trade of course! '70 is a good year. 4 wheel drums are the same 
as 64 to 70, it is a crew cab,
  wiring is simple, it is a crew cab, taillights are the same as 64 to 
70, it is a crew cab and it is a crew cab.

Big issues for trucks are, gates in good shape, rear corners are 
truck only so they should be in good shape, window rubber might be 
tough on the rear cab quarterlights but maybe they are being repopped 
now.

Go trade now!
