+AD4-Hey everybody, I've got a '77 Westie and its getting some water under the
+AD4-carpet just inside the sliding door.
Hi Marcus

My Devon has a vinyl floor over hardboard which started to bubble up
recently. I found the damp was getting in via a rust hole next to the side
window on the other side to the sliding door.

In my case this is on the opposite side to your problem. I think the water
drips down behind the cabinets and tracks across under the vinyl. Anyway
check those windows and seals.
