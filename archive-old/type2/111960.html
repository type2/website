&gt; seeing how its a group cluster and not individual is
&gt; it easier to remove from the front of dash or remove
&gt; just the cluster (not the glass) from under the dash??

Remove the whole thing from the dash.

Remove plastic rivets from heater and vent levers pull levers out, catch
the spring clips!

Unscrew speedo cable

Remove four screws, pull panel out, flip face down, mark and disconnect
wires, remove whole works from bus.
