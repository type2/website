Subject: Dankas all round, engine woes and the smell

This is more or less a repeat from from a previous message, but since I got
bounced from the list I never saw any replies.  Apologies.

The other day, I went to go scavenge a bus (a 79 Auto) I had bought as a
parts bus.  As I went down into the beast and started getting dirty, I
started to wax sentimental and decided maybe this bus wasn't quite ready
for salvaging and I should try to put it back together.

yeah, yeah, whatever, I hear you saying.  Well here's the scenario:  The
engine will start, but idles very badly, oscillating between about 1500 rpm
and almost dying.  Pushing on the gas produces a more consistent, but still
oscillating and very rough idle.  No power at all.  By revving it up in a
very unconventional manner (popping the cap of the air intake sensor and
moving that little contact around) I was able to check a few things out.
Namely, it's missing in #'s 1 and 3.  Pulled plug, turned engine over
w/starter, fine spark on plug.  Pulled injectors.  Nice, fine mist.  Pulled
valve covers, turned it over, rockers are rocking just fine.

What's left to cause a miss Iask myself and you?  My guess: valves.
Another question to yous: If it is valves, is it worth it to save this bus?
How much expense is involved in repairing the valves?  What else could this
problem be?

Thanks so much in advance

P.S.  Muffler installation on a 76 is a serious pain in the ass!
