Hey all-
=20
I have a few questions about my engine which I hope can be easily
answered.  Since I got my bus it=92s never run too well.  That said my
setup is this: dual port 1600, engine code AH., 009 distributor and a 34
pict 3 carb.  And some noisy 4 tip empi exhaust.  My real question(s) is
what would run best =96 should I find a stock distributor (and what =
would
that be=85), a different carb, a stock exhaust?.... I=92m just tired of =
my
bus running like crap.  My main beef is that the carb seems really hard
to tune and I just never can get it right.  Any advice would help=85
Before the archives went down I remember seeing that more than a couple
of people had trouble with a 009 and a 34.3.
