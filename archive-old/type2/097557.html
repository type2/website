Subject: Re: [VB] Full-length rack for sale

What's really funny about this comment is I was at a campout in my Panel bus
the last weekend in July.  I have that exact same rack by the way(happen to
know anything about it?).  Anyway, this couple was camped next to me, and
the guy looks at my bus and said &quot;nice rack.&quot;  His girlfriend of course
turned and said &quot;thank you.&quot;

&gt; Then when someone says &quot;nice rack&quot; you can point to the top of
&gt; your bus and say &quot;Why, thank you!&quot;
