Have made a succesful motor change?? Not just a replacement VW motor into a VW bus, but for example a Porsche motor into an aircooled bus?? Or a watercooled VW, Mercedes, or Subaru, Toyota motor into an aircooled VW bus? Diesel conversion??  If so, how much did it cost, and how satisfied were you with the completed project?? Was it worth it, and would you do it again??
