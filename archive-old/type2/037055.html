Subject: Fwd:  Re: MPG of a 74 Bus

Hi volks,

&gt; &gt; I looked in the archives and it seems that a 74
&gt; &gt; bus should get 17-19mpg. Is this true? I had a 77
&gt; &gt; FI and it sucked, 10-12mpg. Was it just not tuned

&gt; VW says it should get around 15MPG.

 I think the 15mpg figure is realistic. When I compiled the statistics
listed in the library I was struck by how high some of the numbers
were: I still suspect that some of the numbers are a little selective.

&gt; my 78 FI gets 15 or so in all big city stop and go driving, on the
road
&gt; (with a good tailwind) I can almost get to 20mpg.

 Bear in mind that highway fuel usage in a bus depends a LOT on your 
cruising speed. When I had a '71 I used to get 20mpg out of it on
open roads because I used to drive at 50-55mph to preserve the engine.
 Now that I have a '77, with a nice chunky 2.0l type-4 I drive at
70-75mph (or more) when conditions allow: This saves me a lot of time
but costs a lot of fuel. I'm sure I could get 20mpg out of it if I
wanted to, but it's not worth the time.

 That said, the efficiency of the aircooled engines isn't going to 
vary much. At a steady 55mph you're going to be using pretty much the
same amount of power in a '77 as in a '71 (a little more uphill or
accelerating because of the extra weight). Either should get about
18mpg or more for this sort of driving, and if it doesn't then it
would be worth finding out why not.

Cheers,
	W.
