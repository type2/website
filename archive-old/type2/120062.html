Hey Steve. Is this a linux system? I have had little success putting my linux 
laptop &quot;to sleep&quot;. I think I'm actually suspending to RAM. When it comes back 
up I lose the use of the keyboard and need to reboot. Maybe it's just my 
laptop. I'm using Mandrake 9.2.


&gt; Being in software development I am also in the process of designing 
&gt; a unified player for dvds, mp3s, mpgs, avi's etc based on an opensource
&gt; linux player with a clean touchscreen interface.

I've used noatun with shortcut keys in the past to play mp3s in a vehicle. It 
worked OK. MDK 9.2 came with the Totem player which seems to do a good job of 
playing everthing...


&gt; I was previously using a wireless keyboard and mouse.

Yeah, sounds to me like touch screen is indeed the way to go in a vehicle. 
Where did you get your screen from?


&gt; I've built 5 of these units for myself and others and I've always used
&gt; linux.

Got any pics? BTW, noticed your telus_dot_net domain. Where abouts are you 
located?
