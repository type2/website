Subject: i might have a problem?(bug in a westy)

volks,

i'm just a 17 yr old guy. today i dopped the engine out of the 69 bug that 
i'm putting in my 72 westy. when i was sliding the engine off the 
transmission pin( the little thing that the engine sits on, on the tranny) 
anyways i ws pulling the engine off the pin when all of the sudden i heard a 
little crack. i looked behind the engine, where the tranny and the engine 
mesh, and on the tranny pin was this little triangular plate. this plate 
must have got jammed in between the engine and the pin when i was pulling it 
off and the corner broke off it. will this be a problem? or was it just a 
part of the tranny?

keep in mind i'm extremely inexperienced, but i feel there is only one way 
to learn, and i'm enjoying it. so far everything is going awsome. except the 
broken plate.
any help would be much appreciated.
