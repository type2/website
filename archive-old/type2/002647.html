Subject: Tailgate annexe or the incredibly fast growing  #1 son
Date: Thu, 26 Jun 2003 18:21:39 +0100
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I've seen on a couple of vans a tailgate annexe which makes the sleeping
area above the engine bigger,i have a growing son who is happy to sleep over
the engine at the moment but the day is fast approaching that he won't fit
there anymore the options are to :1.have a pop-top fitted(  which i don't
want)
     2.Get a smaller son!!
     or 3. Find a source for the above conversion.
Does any one know of this type of annexe-was it a westy thing or can you
still get them or has anyone any homebrewed plans for one ?  Help! Martin
