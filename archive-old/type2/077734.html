Subject: Re: [T2] Gas fill elbows COOL FIND

&gt;Is this the elbow you are looking for?

No its not actually, and of course I paid quite a bit less for the
upper elbows when I last bought the couple I have.  Seems to me
Bus Depot wants a bit less right now in fact.  I'm looking for the lower
elbow of course.  Replacing one without the other is sort of a foolhardy
waste of effort.

Good to see things never change the list profiteering goes on.
Hmmn I wonder if I'll ever get my Bus Boys catalog, I've been waiting
on that now for like maybe 7-8 years or so?  Even sent you guys cash
one time, let alone quite a few orders years ago....

On a more serious note, I'm sorry folks actually I can't even find the
web site I ordered the buna elbow from, I've got no darn clue what I
was looking for at the time.  When it comes, I'll figure out who it was
and post about it.  I am beginning to worry if the diameter is 2 1/4 though
or 2 1/8, I went looking for the last bit of the old Gates stuff I had then
realized I gave it away with the '70 single cab.  Regardless you can get
the silicone ones right now off of ebay, if you search for turbocharger you
will see a company selling them in 2, 2 1/4, 2 1/2 for $28 each, which is
a pretty average price.
