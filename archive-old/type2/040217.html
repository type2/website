Subject: High Country Bus Festival

This is an informational email about the 4th Annual High Country Bus 
Festival, held July 28-30 near Boone, NC.  For all info, including 
directions, ect check our web page:
http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~contecmidwest

T-shirts will be handled on an advanced basis again this year, and Orders 
are due by July 1st.  There is an order form on the web page, but it is not 
an e-form, you must print a copy and send it to me via  snail mail.  There 
will not be extra shirts available at the Festival, so be sure to reserve 
yours.

If anyone would like to head-up a CaraBus to the HCBF, drop me an email.  I 
know some of the Full Moon Guys are planning a carabus from the Charleston, 
SC area and Jeff and the Roanoke buses will be carabusing up the mountain.  
Let me know if you want to start a carabus from your area and I will post 
that information on the web page.

If anyone would like to donate a Door Prize for the ceremony Saturday Night 
please let me know - thanks in advance for your generosity.

Please let me know if you have any questions, and I look forward to seeing 
you all in July!
