Subject: clutch cable again!

David, Karl, Ted, all,
 
More thoughts on my clutch cable. I didn't pull it yet, tonight.

&gt;Where is it breaking?  If in the bowden tube area, &gt;replace the bowden tube.  If damaged, it can cause &gt;the clutch cable to fail

The bowden tube is the first thing it runs thru in the front (fif) of the bus correct? Then the cable is exposed, then it enters that flexible tube that has a special name in the bentley that I read yesterday and don't remember. I assume damage to the bowden tube would mean crimped/cut in some way, rubbing on the cable.

&gt;Which end broke?
&gt;Do you always replace the pin on the front end? Hope &gt;so! Always put grease on the wing nut? Hope so, it &gt;pivots on the ball of the wing nut. If it binds on &gt;the ball it will snap the cable.

Apparently it's important where it broke. No I've not replaced the pin, guess I will now. No, I didn't grease the wing nut.

I guess I haven't been a good clutch cable installer.

Billy
