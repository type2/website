-&gt;cold, but sometimes not in between. I had to do the
-&gt;crawl-under-the-bus-with-big-screwdriver thing about 5 times. The most
-&gt;embarrassing moment came in Tensleep, WY, during which I not only had to
-&gt;crawl under the bus several times while taking up one of the four gas bays
-&gt;at the local gas station, but also quickly rereading the section in Muir
-&gt;about solenoid jumping. The bus only started when I jumped the ignition
-&gt;terminal on the solenoid to the main connection on it.
-&gt;

Howdy,
        I am not sure what happens when other's try this &quot;jump across the
terminals&quot; trick, but for me I got LOTS OF SPARKS!!!!!! (and no start:)

        In my opinion it would be wise not to do anything that produces FIRE
while laying under a bus next to the pumps at a gas station.  Sounds like a
good way to make the 11 o'clock news.

take care,
        brandy
