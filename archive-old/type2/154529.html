Subject: RE: Missing third (?) cylinder

Thanks for everyone's suggestions! Turned out to be the
balance-tube-to-manifold elbow on the opposite side. First I did not check
that side since it seemed to be a #3 issue. The strange thing is that the
cylinder closest to the vacuum leak ran fine while the one on the other end
of the balance tube was causing me trouble ...

Thanks,
Marcus
