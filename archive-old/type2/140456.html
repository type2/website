Subject: [T2] water tank end cap


&gt; Hi guys ,
&gt;
&gt; Is it that obvious that I can't find any info either on google or type2 
&gt; archives about the end cap spec of my water tank ?
&gt; Is anyone has an idea where to find them , I've seen a 1&quot; end cap at Home 
&gt; depot , do you think it could  fit, that's the closest I found taking 
&gt; measurement with a caliper ?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt;
&gt; Have a great WE
&gt;
