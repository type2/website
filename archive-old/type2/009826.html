Hello all,

	I've got a type IV, 1974 Bus that I will soon use for a month long
trip to Alaska.  Originally I was planning on rebuilding the engine with
my father, but recently we have wondered if it would be better to simply
purchase a rebuilt engine from GEX and install it ourselves.  I have heard
few negative remarks about the company on this list already, and I was
wondering what the lists opinion on this engine rebuilder is.

	Any and all responses are appreciated.  Thanks in advance.

	   Wade
	   1974, Type IV Bus
