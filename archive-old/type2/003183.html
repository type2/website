hello all well as i mentioned earlier i got my bus back yesterday. well
today i let my brother drive it. it was doing o.k. until we were about one
minute from home it started to race very fast and wouldn't excelerate,we
pulled over and it was pretty hot we had only been driving for about 15
minutes. i thought it night be the choke or carb but i'm not sure as i am
not to mechanically inclined.  after about five or so minutes of cool down
we cranked it up and it sounded fine i really doon't want a relapse so could
someone give me some suggestions? thank you very much...
