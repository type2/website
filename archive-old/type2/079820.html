Subject: Re: [T2] Re: sticky oil piston

I just rebuilt a TypeIV 2000cc and I had the same oil pressure problem of
*Excessive*. Found a bur on my plunger, checked it with a micrometer,
filed it down and reinstalled it. Oil pressure now at 70 PSI at 3300
RPMs, 20-22 Psi at 8-900 RPMs about 40-50 Psi normal driving around town
at operating oil temps around 210-220.
You just never know what the last owner did to an engine until you've
fixed all the things he screwed up.

&gt; took out the relief piston today; had a few microscopic slivers of 
&gt; engine
&gt; in there from the infamous shim-in-gears event. sigh.
&gt; anyways, the piston was a little scored, and was also the short 
&gt; kind,
------------
&gt; drove it around - would go to 65-70, stay there, no wobbles. dropped 
&gt; back
&gt; to 20-30 at idle.  didn't go above 70 no matter what the rev, but it 
&gt; is 70
&gt; degrees out today. i'll try first thing in cold am.
