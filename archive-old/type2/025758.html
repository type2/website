&gt; for example, in Model Railroading, all those toy trains have logo's from
&gt; various companies plastered on the sides,   The Model Hobby Dealers Assoc
&gt; have worked out a token $1 fee for a 25 year license on the use of the
&gt; logo's from the various Railroads.  This protects the logo but allows
&gt; hobbiest to also get the accuracy they desire

And then again...no one's going to suspect that a 1:87 locomotive that says
Great Northern on the side was made by or endorsed by the Great Northern
Railway (which merged with the Burlington Road many, many, many years ago)
or that the little train is somehow infringing on the trademarks of that
road. (Besides, I would imagine that a lot of guys who work for the railroad
have at least a couple model train cars on the mantle, and they'd want the
cars to represent the line they work for.) Volkswagen's a different story.

I wonder if VWoA would accept applications for a &quot;free advertising manager&quot;?
I could do that, people are more than willing to display VW's trade dress on
everything from their cars to their websites to their ears, and so far, VWoA
hasn't figured this out.
