Subject: [T2]Dim Battery light

went on a trip yesterday and on my way back home 2 hour ride.... there and rested and 2 hour back home....
 
on the way back home the battery light started coming on faintly and worried me so i pulled over and checked the fan belt and all and let the engine rest a bit was 1pm and the hottest part of the day trying to get back home...
 
what could cause the battery light to glow faintly...? is it from the hot engine ?????
also my oil level seems ot have been about a half qaurt to a qaurt low.....  
even though i put some in when i did stop its still a half qaurt low now that i am home and the bus has sat overnight for a specific and accurate check....
 
what would cause this battery light to glow like this./././././? could it have been just becuase the engine was that hot or cause i was a little low on oil...? i know that sounds strange LOL 
 
made me worry though
 
 i am fixing to take a hour trip today also so my concerns are up....
anyone got a clue on this/////////
 
??????? i think my oil breather for some reason is acting up again to cause the use in oil though,.,.,, its blowing out the dipstick again....small amounts but still doing so....
 
my oil temp gauge never went past 220 but once and i slowed down to 50-55 from 60-65......
it dropped back down to 220......
 
question is still over the dim battery light though...
 
76 bus

Thanks Kyndly
