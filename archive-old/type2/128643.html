Subject: Re: [T2] Gasoline coming out of tailpipe

Hello Phil    Was this a brand new carb or a reman carb???  Either way the 
check valves in either os them have gotten to be junk.  It has gotten to the 
point where with a brand new carb you still are better off using the old check 
val;ve if it checks out good. If it is sticking it will usually pump gas out the 
intake vent that is visible at the top of the carb. You might also consider 
changing your oil after you solve your problem  Later and have fun  Mark
