Subject: Re: [T2] Need an Honest Bus Mechanic

&gt;I am a bondo magician, but when it comes to engines I am a deer in the head
lights.  I found out for myself that if you can turn a wrench, then you can
replace your exhaust yourself.  I wish I had a cutting torch to use, but I
ended up borrowing a Saws-All from work, and used it to cut the bolts off.
Actually, I ended up cutting the bolts only 1/2 way through, and using my
biggest badest vicegrips I snapped off the heads. It took a few hours
(between beers), but I got it all off.  Lucky for me, my manifold tubes are
healthy, so I didn't have to go that far.

Kevin:  I'll second this.  There are no adjustments and such to make on the
exhaust, and it really is something that you can do yourself.  It's more or
less remove-old-attach-new.

I pulled the entire system at one shot, using a floor jack and a piece of
plywood to support muffler &amp; exchangers.  The jack goes at the center of
mass, which is farther back than you might think.  Took a lot of wiggling to
get it off.  Time consuming but not really hard.  If the muffler will come
off by itself, do it that way; prolly easier.  I tried but succeeded only in
turnin rusty hex nuts into rusty round nuts.

&gt;I ordered used heater boxes and pipes from Jim's VW salvage in Alabama
(http://www.skybusiness_dot_com/jimsvw/ ) at $35 for each heater box.  I got an
email from them today saying they sent them out today, so I can't say how
good they are yet.  But they are also sending me heater controllers for
$35/pair with connecting tubes.  I also ordered the $99 special at
California Imports (p/n#vwc-071-251-053-ps) with new gaskets.  This part
replaces the muffler, cross over pipe, and elbow.  I figure I'll have to go
to Home Depot and get bolts, but in All I will spend about $260 in all.

Thanks for the source, Snoop.  AL isn't far from here, I'll have to check it
out.  Kevin, be sure you get the right parts.  Maureen's PO kindly threw in
a set of extra heater boxes, but Maureen's 78 engine doesn't take 79 boxes...

Use copper nuts on the muffler.  Liberal application of anti-sieze on
studs/bolts before installing the new.  My muffler was from Bus Depot.  It's
German, tailpipe is Brazilian.  Eight months later the tailpipe is covered
with surface rust while the muffler is clean as the proverbial whistle.

When replacing the system, I installed exchangers, then tried to install
muffler.  No go; bent pipes and such meant that only one side of the muffler
would bolt up.  I had to loosen the nuts at the head, then install muffler
loosely, then go round and tighten everything in turn.

Give it a shot, Kevin.  Get in touch with yer bus.
