&gt; Heat Exchanger, left only,'72-74 Bus, as above, Part # 021 256
&gt; 091M  $139.95

My above post was incorrect.  The genuine German heat exchangers I have for
the '72-74 are RIGHT side only, 021 256 092AC.  Left side is available in
Danish Dansk only, for $189.95.  By the way, if ordering this from the
websitem, you must specify that you are a list member in the comments
section of the order form, in order to get the $139.95 price.  It will come
up at $10 more, but if you specify your list membership in the comments
section of the order form $10 will be deducted from the price when we fill
the order.
