Subject: LP Regulator

Hello everyone!

 I finally got to take my 82 Westy on a camping trip last weekend and I sure
enjoyed it!! One of the neat surprises I got was a leaking regulator for the
LP system. I went to a local farm and ranch store (no FLAPS within 50 miles)
and got a barbecue grill regulator. The regulator on the bus was a two stage
and the one I got is a single stage. My question is, is this going to hurt
the LP system in my bus?? Any answer will be appreciated!!
