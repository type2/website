Subject: hand cranking a VW

though a fair number of people have emailed about hand cranking, it seems
that over half have been referring to MGs or Model Ts, NOT VWs, which are
what I am interesteed in.   The only report of kicking back on a VW was with
a custom modified motor used for some industrial purpose, none on stock
industrial VWs or VW installed in buses.    A couple mentions were made of
cranking over 1600s, but without any problems.   BTW, The crank nut will fit
a 1600, and I had played with the idea of doing that, but never did.  Maybe
I'll take the crank nut and pulley off Nellie, paint the pulley (I painted
all the other tin), and put it back on with a crank nut.

unless I hear otherwise, I will assume that a stock, well tuned 36hp motor
does not  kick back.  But as I am already in the habit of not using the
thumb, that will continue.

And I think we should try to get some of these 50s buses up and running with
crank gear.
Who's are they, other than mine and Thom's?   Anyone else actually have
 running 36hp motor in a VW?
