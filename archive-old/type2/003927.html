Subject: Removal of BA6! &amp; Q's

Back to bus work,

How many of you have your mechanics yard behind your house? And if you do,
how many of you have keys for that yard? And how many have use of all
equipment at any time, even book a day on a ramp for free?

Hope your all green with envy, I have to say my mechanic is the best, when
it come to working on my bus, to have a 4 post ramp to put it on is
fantastic!

Today I could get on the ramp a day early, so having no idea how long it
would take to remove the heater, I got stuck in.

I labelled all the plugs &amp; removed the loom which was separate to the main
loom (phew!). Then I removed the heater it's self, my only concern is that
my bus is a converted factory high-top panel van so has no mounts for the
heater, or the vent for re-cycling, but I prefer fresh air &amp; as I am also
putting new GENUINE heat exchangers in, the system should be Very warm.

 All the ancillary bits came out &amp; have been boxed up. Since I am not
re-cycling air from the interior, do I need the large fan at the rear?

I left the Fuel line in &amp; capped it off, as the thought of pulling &amp;
stretching an oldish fuel line (it did look fine, or I would have replaced
it) did not appeal to me. The exhaust for this heater exits at the side of
the bus just in front of the rear wheel, but is rusted through &amp; will be
replaced.

As for condition of the heater it worked well in the original bus, but was
smelly. But if the heater was off &amp; just the heat exchanger working it was
just as smelly, so I think this is just the old heat exchangers sitting in
the flow of a minor oil leak.

As they say &quot;VW's don't leak, they just mark their spot&quot;
