Subject: Re; head leak

Just to clarify;

The shims that go between the cylinder and the block are used to adjust 
for proper compression once you've cc'd the heads.  You must select 
ones with the appropriate thickness to achieve the desired compression 
ratio.  There should be no gasket or shim between the heads and the 
tops of the cylinders, per VW's recommendation.  You may get a gasket 
kit that contains head gaskets however you shouldn't use them.  AFAIK, 
the head gaskets and the cylinder barrel/case shims are not 
interchangeable.  They are different diameters.
