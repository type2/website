Subject: broken ring = broken bank ?

Having recently returned from my mechanic, a leakdown test diagnosed a
broken ring on #4 ( compressed air leaking down into crankcase and blowing
out through pushrod tubes )....explained the odd engine note, occasional
backfire, and general sluggish behaviour.
Most of this is due the fact that the people who I purchased the 1641cc from
did a crap job  (they, Volkspares, shall remain nameless !)......not
bothering to compensate high compression by bevelling piston
heads.....something I didn't know till now, amongst other laughable
additions and omissions on my engine.
( I will gladly defend my position on this company off-list or in court
should anyone wish to take this up.)
anyway, the ball-park figure to sort this mess out is in the region of
£700.00, £400 of which is labour......two kids, I can think of better places
to put this £400 !
so.....given the fact that I can buy the parts, does one have to be a rocket
scientist to replace all pistons, barrels and heads (1971 upright
engine ).....and, given the fact that even VW abandonned the idea of a
1600cc pushing a loaf, are there any other pitfalls to going for a bigger
bore, given that the pistons have been dished, and how big can you go ?
also, how long would this operation take, ie: how long would I be without a
bus ?
I, as ever, appreciate your help.
