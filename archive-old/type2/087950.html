Subject: Bus Sighting

Did anybody else catch 'Farscape' on the SciFi channel tonight? In a couple
of scenes there was a RHD baywindow bus with front mounted spare and brush
guard. It was painted up in full &quot;hippie&quot; style with big flowers and peace
signs. It lost a little authenticity when the driver squealed the tires.

Regards,
Dave
