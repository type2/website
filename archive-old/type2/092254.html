Subject: Re: [T2] How to wire stove for 1978 Westy ?

As I recall, the wire is for the water pump.  It needs a ground (brown)
and red (positive wire).  Under the dash on mine was an inline vw fuse
holder that fed this red wire.  I teed into this wire and put a cig.
ligher outlet into the hole in the grill under the stove holding the
knobs; it is the exact size for a FLAPS outlet that has the screwing
metal collar!  Not sure what the black wires are for......
 I have a 1978 Westy deluxe that was missing the sink / stove cabinet
 when I purchased it. I found a new cabinet in good shape and want to
 install it. I see a long red wire with a push on connector, and a short
brown
 wire with push on connector (I take it to be ground ?).
