&gt; Richard et al:
&gt; 
&gt; I posted the following on the 10th of April... FYI:
&gt; 
&gt; Folks, for what it's worth:
&gt; 
&gt; I recently bought a gorgeous Volvo 765 with nary a problem but a
&gt; sagging
&gt; headliner. I took it to a local Headliners Plus! guy, and was
&gt; consequently so
&gt; 
&gt; impressed with his work and rates, I went home, drove my 78 Westy
&gt; back
&gt; 
&gt; to him, and asked what he could do about that godforsaken mildew
&gt; stain
&gt; 
&gt; on the &quot;fuzzy&quot; crap that lines the inside of the poptop. (I had,
&gt; by that point,
&gt; 
&gt; spent egregious amounts of money on surely every
&gt; commercially-available
&gt; 
&gt; product... and nearly killed myself in the process a number of
&gt; times:
&gt; 
&gt; fumes tend to congregate up there!)
&gt; 
&gt; Well, he takes a gander, and in the end, for a mere $250, he
&gt; installed a
&gt; &quot;marine-grade&quot; headliner, a nice comfy kinda stuff, PADDED mind
&gt; you,
&gt; 
&gt; and (here's the kicker) applied 3/4&quot; oak strips all the way
&gt; around
&gt; 
&gt; the inside of the poptop - to which he re-stapled the canvas
&gt; (which was
&gt; sagging on one side) and screwed them into the fiberglass.
&gt; 
&gt; It looks incredible - and is surely the
&gt; one-thing-I-didn't-do-myself of
&gt; which I am the proudest! I highly encourage other folks to
&gt; investigate
&gt; 
&gt; similar options, if $250 is reasonable for them.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers!
&gt; 
&gt; Justin L. Smith
