Subject: Bay Window Value (was a $10.5k westy)
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

&gt;I guess David and I are the only ones that think
&gt;this may be reasonable. When I first started looking
&gt;for a Westy, I found several rust buckets (Oh, they


&gt;, and trashed interiors. They all wanted between 3
&gt;3.5K!! I ended up buying the &quot;best&quot; one I could find


Well I've been meaning to get in on this.  $10,500 is quite ludicrous IMHO
but I'm not saying it isn't worth it, just I wouldn't.  Some have seen the
'77 I
purchased maybe 3 years back.  It is an anally maintained, garaged, 1.5
owners (2nd didn't really own it long enough) van with 78k when I bought it.
It brings to light the interesting question regarding the origional van of
being
&quot;restored.&quot;  My '77 would require ZERO restoration, I purchased the worlds
supply of interior fabric just to be sure but even that was far from worn.
Any
van asking over $7500 should be clean origional with no &quot;restoration&quot; work
done, normal maintainence, perhaps a new engine, but no metal work, and
largely no paint in my opinion.  I paid $3500 or $3800 don't recall,  I
would
never part with it but if I had to (to survive) today I would sell for $6000
or so,
probably would ask $7500.
      BUT all this said, bay windows are beginning to climb to
collectibility, soon
to be just like splits crazy as that seems, the humble Vanagon never
likely to attain such status so these are the &quot;last&quot; of the VW buses.  Clean
(I
hope and surmise) bays, campers particularly '77-'79, go asking in approach
of $5-10k all the time in Hemmings Motor News, and seldom do the adds run
more than a month (whether from sale or simply they quit running I do not
know.)

Some recent examples.

September:

'70 Westy, side tent, new paint, rebuilt engine, $4000 Dallas TX
(512)847-3890

'71 station wagon, 2nd owner, no salt, no rust, garaged, jalousie windows,
sleeps 2 perfect interior, origional paint, A/C, $9500 IA (319)588-4058

'73 camper, non poptop, rust free, sleeps 2, solid undercarraige, no
sink/fridge, 7k on pro trans/engine rebuild, single Weber, $5500 CT
(203)270-8881

'73 transporter, 58,300 miles, orange/white, 4 spd, no rust, no fade,
mint with origional bill of sale and window sticker $9000 PA (717)687-9500

'77 Deluxe bus, 91,000 mile, sunroof, all works, records, $6000 NC

'78 Champagne camper (cool) rebuilt engine, auto, exc cond, $5500
PA (717)764-6695

'79 camper, excellent running cond, $6000 CT (203)387-1817
(back in Nov)

October:

'74 bus, 4 spd, all orgional AZ car, engine at 42k, 87k miles total, driven
summer
only, no rust, $3500 MI (248)474-0016 (back in Nov)

'79 camper near mint origional (should be mint origional for this $$$$)
$14000
IL (708)448-2885

And the undoubted most ridiculous bay asking price (depending on your POV)
in this month.

'68 Campmobile, as new, 53k mile, 100% origional, complete with all
acessories
and manual, near showroom.  $15900 ???  you all go for it (314)524-6000

The take home message here, they are worth whatever YOU think they are
worth.  Buses in the south, or from the south with owners who realize they
are still available
for a relative pitiance in the dry areas seem to be more reasonable, hell in
the last
Hot VW's there was what looked like a gorgeous '75 Westy in TX with easily
the
asking price ($4000) just in the 2.4L engine, dual Webers, etc.  I looked at
what
could easily have been advertised as the above '68 2 years back in Baltimore
and
decided $4500 was too much, this one was from the neat origional owners who
had accepted European delivery, had all the documents from new for service
and
the import, a slew of advertising, the installation manuals for the VW
dealer installed
(in Scandanvia somewhere) topedo heater, an English made aux refrigerator
that seamlessly replaced the origional icebox, and the killer for me a brand
new never
erected tent (the real reason I went to see it) all with about 75k loving
miles.  It had
10 small (1/4&quot; diameter) rust holes in one rocker and a dent on the left
rear quarter,  good work and a tiny respray and it would have been new.  I
passed as I had just bought the '77 in better conditions and even with the
tent seemed unreasonable at
the time.  I think another list member may have bought it at my suggestion.

Anyway a long ramble, if you think a bay is worth $10k good luck to you
getting
such for it or paying that much for one.  I'd stake my life on being able to
replace
the '77 today for under $5500 if I kept my eyes open.
