Subject: Very Interesting Bus--VW Place

Hi Everyone.  Have not posted in a while but today I had to.  My 
office relocated to a new building 5 months ago very close to LA 
Airport and I have been driving by an Industrial lot since we moved 
where just over the top of the fence I can see the tops of a bunch of 
old busses.

Well....today I drove by and they were open so I stopped.  Turns out 
this place does VW restoration only.  In the Lot were about 6-8 
busses waiting to be worked on---Crew cabs, split windows and even in 
the shop currently being worked on a 1959 23 window.  Very Very cool. 
Also---various Ghias, bugs, square and fast backs.(couple of Porsches 
as well)

The other thing they do there is they bring up NEW  bugs from mexico, 
remove the fenders...change them, shave the mirrors and make them 
looks like 1966's.  They then ship these to Japan.  

I got to check out a 1996 Mexican bug...pretty weired...Fuel injected 
1600 motor with AIR CONDITIONING!!!  Disc Brakes  etc.
Very nice interior...looked great!

The guy was very nice and said that I could post the company name 
number etc.  Don't know much more that what I saw but what I saw 
looked nice.  Very organized place and nice people.  He must be well 
known because the sign says nothing about what they do there.
