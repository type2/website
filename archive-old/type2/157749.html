&gt; I put an amp in the closet in the back of my 1977 Westy and need an RCA
cable about 25 feet long  to get from my head unit to the amp.

&gt; I don't want to spend a lot, I am thinking $65.00 maximum

How about $3.50?

I've done a lot of business with this outfit.  If you think finding a 25'
RCA cable is tough, try finding a 25' VGA cable!  Yep, they have those
too.

Monster cable is horribly overpriced.  For head to amp you don't need a
huge piece of wire.
