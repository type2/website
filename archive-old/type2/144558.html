I disagree.  Manufacturers have been going to oils of _less_ viscosity
in search of improved fuel mileage, not because of any deficiency with
10W40.  They've gone to 5W30 and even 0W20 (yes, zero!).  Following their
lead for our VWs would not be a good idea, since our engines are designed
to use the higher viscosity stuff.  For a relatively fresh VW, 10W40
is a good choice.  After a while, when the bearings get a bit looser,
20W50 will get you a few more miles.
