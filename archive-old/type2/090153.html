Subject: Re: [T2] EGR vacuum line &amp; oil pump blueprinting questions (fwd)

Tom,

This is what we call &quot;a screw up&quot;  I screwed up!  I don't know why, but i
had my mind set on a type1 engine and when I looked at your pump I didn't
make the mental switch to type4.  It's a type4 oil pump, it's *obviously*
a type4 oil pump, I just didn't make the switch... looked at it thinking
&quot;type1&quot; and went, &quot;Whoa!  Never seen one of these!&quot;

That being said, while I *have* actually seen some of those, I don't know
the answer to your original question :-( Long ago, I priced the parts for
a type4 rebuild and priced rebuilt engines, and stopped rebuilding my own.
I've never tried to rehab a type4 oil pump, and I don't know how I would
approach it, I am sorry to say.
