&gt; Just another comment on cooling flaps, and engine warm up time.
&gt; After the fire, becasue the flap bushings were melted, I wired my flaps
&gt; open, disabling the thermostat. On my short runs of about 4 miles to work,
&gt; I found that the gas milage sucked. It got worse as the weather got cooler
&gt;

       I would really doubt the correlation. Gauges show pretty clearly what
the engine temps are, and really the only purpose of the flaps is to get
engine heat to the cabin quicker. The engine is going to be fully warmed up
within 5 minutes, flaps or no flaps. Oil temps take longer to rise, and won't
go all the way up until you spend some time on the interstate, but the flaps
don't influence oil temps all that much. When they are fully open, in fact,
they're more blocking the oil cooler than anything.
      Of course, if you're making primarily short trips in cold weather and
*don't* do the warm up thing before driving off, the flaps might influence
gas milage, but by short I mean 2-3 miles or less.
      For me it's irrelevant, since either way I would still sit there until
the head temp read 100. And the head temp is usually up to 250-300 within a
block or so anyway, at which point the flaps would be open.
