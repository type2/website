Hey Folks,

Just had something intersting happen to me this weekend and thought I'd
share it with you.

Coming home Friday night, I spotted a car stalled on the side of the road.
As I drove by I could see a woman sitting inside.  So, I turned the bus
around and stopped to see if I could help.  As I approached the driver's
side window, I could see that the woman inside had her face buried in her
arms and was in mid sigh.  I asked if she was ok.  She replied &quot;No, I'm not
ok.  It is late, I'm out of gas, I don't have any money, and I don't know
anyone to call.&quot;  So, I drove to the gas station, bought a small gas
container, and filled it up with gas.  After pouring the gas in the woman's
car, giving her a jump-start (battery was dead from her trying to start it),
and adding a little fuel directly into the carb, she was once again on her
way.

Well, as you can imagine, I went home feeling pretty good about myself and
my good deed.  But here is where it gets good.  This morning I'm out running
errands and running late with tons of stuff that I have to do when my Bus
runs out gas in the middle of nowhere (Like most buses, my fuel guage
doesn't work).  Of course, I'm furious and thinking how long it is going to
take me to fix this.  Then, I look back and see the gas can that I bought to
help the lady out on Friday night.  And with good Karma it is still 1/2 full
of gas.  Poured the gas in the bus, turned the key, and went on my way.
Besides keeping me from being stranded, the little episode quickly put a lot
of things into a lot clearer focus with much improved perspective.

Until Later,

Darrin K. Pierce
