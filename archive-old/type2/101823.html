&gt; Hey folks,
 Speeding I can go along with but
&gt; the seatbelt is a joke to me. For one I have Nissan
&gt; seats in my bus which are higher than the stock ones
&gt; and make it hard to shift. Adding a seatbelt to that
&gt; would restrict my shoulder movement and make shifting
&gt; all but impossible. Just wondering if there is any
&gt; hard evidence out there showing the value of wearing a
&gt; seatbelt in a '78 T2.

Giles-

Your question may be interesting but it is completely irrelevent. Seat belt
usage is the law just about everwhere, so wear them or save up to pay the
tickets. You could argue it in front a judge all day, but The Law makes no
allowance for your seating modifications.

Sorry pal,
