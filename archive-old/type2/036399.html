Subject: Re: 009 dist in a 1700

the 009's have a fairly inconsistent advance curve.  it has been my
experience that setting the 009 on a 1700/1800 is best done by setting total
advance.  buy an advance timing light from sears ($60) and set your timing
to 28 degrees total advance.  this will give you a great running engine. 
and without fears of pinging from the timing being advanced to far.  

this advice applies to all dizzys.  they all wear out.  check total advance.
this is the ONLY way to be sure of 1-not to much advance and 2- getting the
most advance without ping.

&gt;  I've read on a couple of lists about the hesitation that the 009 dist
gives 
&gt;  you on take off. The 72 bus I just got and had tuned up by a 30+ year
vetran 
&gt;  of VWs, has this hesitation. It also has the aftermarket Weber
progressive 
&gt;  2brl carb. Does anyone have a better setup for this engine or know what
the 
&gt;  original dist should be? Also, could it be used with the weber setup. Im 
&gt;  also thinking about going to the electronic setup, but would this be ok
in 
&gt;  the 009 or better to go with the orginal dist. The mechanic also said
that 
&gt;  some of the webers he has seen is the cause of this hesitation and some
run 
&gt;  like a champ. Has anyone ever tried several webers and had this problem
with 
&gt;  one and not the other ?
