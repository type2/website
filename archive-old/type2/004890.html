   hey, this is David, Rick McGuirt's son, for all those who have been
reading up on my science fair project. Below is my Abstract, which is just a
brief overveiw of the whole expirement. Sorry to disappoint some of you but
I'm only 14 and the cars were 1:32 scale models. I built a wind tunnel out
of a 12x12x48 cardboard box like you would get at Mailboxes Etc., put a
wooden frame on it for support and the drag apparatus, and a fan at the end.
I only measured the Bus and Lamborghini, but  I'll probably test the Beetle
for next years science fair. Actually, the Bus didn't have to have that much
more weight than the Lambo (you'll read about it further down). I'll have a
much more discriptive explanation of the project out later. If anyone has
any tips I'd be glad to here them. Lata.

Note: the formula below is supposed be to V= 8.1 x square root of tangent
theta.

   I did my science project on the aerodynamics of cars as tested with a
wind tunnel. What I’m attempting to show is as the wind passes over a
vehicle a vacuum is created behind the vehicle where the wind has not met
yet. The vacuum behind a vehicle creates turbulence, which slows the car
down. To prove this I built a wind tunnel. First I had to test the wind
tunnel itself to see if it was airtight. This being so, I moved on to see
which type of smoke I was to use. Since air is invisible, I used dry ice to
show the air flowing over the cars. I had everything set except for the fan
needed to pull the air through the tunnel. First I tried a shop fan, which
even set on low dissipated the vapors so much that I could not even see it
moving through the test region! I then decided to switch to a smaller
household fan. The wind was just right at the very lowest setting. I set out
to find how fast the wind was actually traveling. To find the wind speed I
used a ping-pong ball and a protractor for the wind speed apparatus and the
formula:

                              V = 8.1   tan

   That gave me meters per second. Since we use the English system I
converted that to miles per hour..
I chose to use ‘60s era Volkswagen Bus (Van), Beetle, and a current
Lamborghini Diablo for my test vehicles. The reason being because I decided
where there isn’t structure a vacuum may be formed. For example, on the bus
there’s a straight drop off at the rear. When the air hits the end, it takes
it a long time to meet with the air flowing from the other sides of the van
and the vacuum is created here. I also made a device to measure drag using
various weights, a pivot, and a pully. After I cut the slot in the
plexi-glass window on the tunnel, I measured how much weight it took to get
the Lambo and Bus to the center of the slot and how much it took to keep it
at the center point. I found that it took .2 oz. to get the Lamborghini to
the center and .4 oz. to keep it there, whereas it took .4 to get the Bus to
the center and .6 to get it there.
   I concluded that much less turbulence is created behind a streamlined
object like the Lamborghini, which is fully structured and very aerodynamic,
rather than a bluff, flat object like the Bus.
