Subject: [T2] RE: ** Dead Westy ** (diagnostic help)

I think I've got the hesitation problems sorted out on my '82 gas     
Westy. ** Thanks to Tom, Bill, Bob, Bill and Peter for your help. **  
Here's what I did as per their suggestions. I started with the easiest
items, and it fixed the problem so I didn't have to go on to anything 
major.                                                                
                                                                      
- Replaced the fuel filter                                            
                                                                      
- Bypassed (grounded) the temp sensor in the cylinder head (when warm 
it read 1.7 ohms. I've got a new one on order)                        
                                                                      
- Checked for air leaks. Found a small leak in the hose going from the
AFM to the aux air sensor.                                            
                                                                      
Everything seems to by groovy! I haven't measured the CO yet, but it  
seems to be running much cleaner and using less gas. I had a great    
long weekend camping.                                                 
                                                                      
Cheers and thanks. Type2 is a great resource and community!!
