Subject: Alternator belt length

Hi Volks- I read with interest the thread on using a 356 Porsche pulley on
the alternator to improve cooling. I am going to Natural Bus and I have the
pulley and shims. I am going to change it at NB and note any differences on
the drive back as I am going the same way both directions. The problem is
that I lost the information on the proper belt length that I need. It is
somewhere in a post but I can't find it. Can anyone supply this length so
that I can pick one up today before I leave tomorrow? TIA TBear 

Don't take life to seriously -- you'll never live throught it....
