Yeah! Sounds fun. I get my kicks below 100 mph these days. Not as &quot;brave&quot; as I used to. I stormed across Chattanooga at 105 mph in the Cabrio the other day to scare my sister in law but did not feel as secure as I did 15 years (single man back then) ago running 100 mph for hours on the Autostrada in my '84 Rabbit 'vert. Maybe it was the traffic, maybe it is because I'm older and have responsibilites. Mostly it's prob b/c my wife would have killed me if I got a ticket! &lt;griN!&gt;
