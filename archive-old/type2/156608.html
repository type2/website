&gt; Isn't it different to point out a cool VW find that you are not

&gt; What say ye oh list-Meister(s)?

This question seems to come up periodically.

The problem is separating fish from fowl.  Some ebay sellers have no
compunction against using multiple identities to sidestep &quot;own auction&quot;
restrictions, so it was decided by a list majority to prohibit all
auction advertisements.  That way there is no questions about what is
allowed or not.

OTOH, if a listee has something he would like to sell, he is welcome
to sell it directly on the list.
