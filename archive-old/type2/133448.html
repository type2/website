&gt; Hmm... I was browsing the archive and came across this message:

&gt; While my math skills are REALLY rusty, I get the impression that I
&gt; would NOT be helping things by stripping my heat exchangers down to
&gt; the tubes. I've already removed the sheetmetal boxes from them, and
&gt; was considering cutting off the fins to reduce weight.
&gt;
&gt; So is my impression correct? Would head temps actually go up if the
&gt; exhaust didn't have a way to release heat other than through the
&gt; tailpipe?

just my opinion and experience, I have had the heat exchangers completely
removed along with the fins etc for about 10 years now and have noticed no
difference or change of any measurable amount either way.  just remember
to seal up the fan ducts near the intake blower and keep the little piece
of tin above the push rod tubes in place, the ones below the push rods are
arguable, I have had mine off since the beginning.. exhaust cooling air
just blows straight down into the slipstream..
