Hi Tim and All,

Contrary to Bentley, the air flow meter/sensor can definitely cause the
bucking bus/paint shaker effect.

Bentley does have an easy procedure to check.  Resistance between terminals 6
and 9 should be between 100 and 300 ohms.  Reading through 7 and 8 should be
between 20 and 100 (if I recall correctly).  Mine was way off.

If I had the whole thing to do over, I'd still buy the rebuilt sensor for
$166, AND I'd pay the $35 core charge, use one of the fixes on it, and have a
serviceable spare.  Thirty five for a spare sensor ain't bad.

Also, replacing the front shift rod bushing was the best cheap fix I've ever
done (thanks Steve from Utah Parts Pool).

Good Luck,

Fred Brittain
