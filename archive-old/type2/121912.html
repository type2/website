&gt; Is there any good reason to keep the plastic hose clamps on the 
&gt; booster vacuum tube joints?  I'm thinking of cleaning the joints and 
&gt; switching them to metal hose clamps.  Should I chop the joints and use 
&gt; rubber hose with metal clamps instead?

I recently installed a booster check valve that I got from Richard 
Atwell.  I took the check valve off of the plastic tube completely, and 
instead spliced it directly into the rubber booster hose already hooked 
up to my plenum, using metal hose clamps.  Works perfectly.
