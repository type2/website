Just got back from tire shopping. Was all set to order Yokohama 370's when
the salesman, who seemed to know what he was talking about, suggested I
consider the Cooper Model SRM11. The tire specifications are 185R14, load
range D, max load 1875, inflation pressure 65. As I have not seen this tire
mentioned on the list, has anyone ever used or have an opinion about it. The
salesperson said it has a slightly softer ride and better traction in wet
weather than the Yoko's (meaning he may get a higher commission as I doubt
he has ever used either) Anyhow, anyone have an opinion? I value the list
opinion very highly. TIA TBear

Don't take life too seriously- you'll never live through it.
