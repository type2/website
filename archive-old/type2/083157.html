Subject: Re: [T2] Oil substance leaking at rapid rate ---UPDATE

sound like an engine pull just might happen if your up to it. I know I
can at least pitch in several hours &amp; I'm sure others can as well.
here is a list of sime things you will need.

o-ring for flywheel, bus/Vanagon $1.50  021 105 279  
flywheel mounting washer 72-83 bus/Vanagon $0.95  021 105 275  
Rear Main Seal, Viton, 17-2000 $6.95 $28.00  029 105 245B 
assorted shims (there might be a shim kit out there I don't know)

I pulled these from Ron's site (busdepot_dot_com) so these should be
pretty good $ figures. I would hurry and jump on the ordering if you
are really going to try.

You also should look into replacing the flywheel bolts. These bolts
have a flange on the shread side which will &quot;dig&quot; into the washer in
order to help it hold better &amp; not back out. I'm not sure what the
part number is but I believe it's a M12x1x22 bolt.

&gt; Ok,
&gt; 	Looks like its engine oil. Don't know if I should allow a sigh
&gt; of relief or not.  But somethings tells me that this will be easier to
&gt; keep going than if it were tranny oil.  So, from what I have read, I
&gt; most likely will still have to drop the engine.  After reading the
&gt; archive and such on this, I thought that I may actually be able to
&gt; handle this.  But, a few more sips of coffee tells me that I have hardly
&gt; any of the tools needed to do this.  And not enough money to go and buy
&gt; them.  Looks like the engine oil went down about a half a quart or less.
&gt; 	The list never fails to amaze me.  **questioning myselft--&gt;
&gt; &quot;Would bussers really be willing to spend their weekend at Everybus
&gt; helping me drop my engine?&quot;   This is truly amazing.  I would love to do
&gt; this, but almost feel bad about asking.  Please let me know if there is
&gt; a way that this could be done.  I really have no other option.  I would
&gt; be willing to spend any extra money I have to get tools if needed
&gt; (Granted that's not much $)  Also, what seal is it that I would need to
&gt; get?  Should I get other seals to replace while I am at it?  I can't
&gt; thank the list enough and truly appreciate what you have all done.
&gt; 
&gt; Sincerely
