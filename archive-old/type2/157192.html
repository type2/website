Subject: Re: [T2] Starting troubles in San Diego

First, thanks for the responses.

After todays adventures, I am left knowing two things. 1 Kragen does not have the ability to properly test the unit it sold me. and 2 I don't think the Starter/Solenoid is the issue. 

I'll skip the frustrating part of my day and get to the point.  With a new rebuilt replacement Starter/Solenoid (whichs theoretically works properly) Sunshine still won't start.  Ok.  So it has to be something else.  Back to the computer to check for responses from you guys.

Two things stand out.  1 Go back to the start.  The issue began with the engine stopping.  2 Is the engine spinning freely?

So I go back out.  I double check the stick shift, run it through the gears and back to neutral.  I grab a wrench, put it on the Alternator Pulley and try to hand turn the engine.  The Alternator pulley slips under the fan belt (I suppose I could tighten that up but not the point) otherwise nothing moves.  I go the other direction and everything turns normally, fan belt does not slip, but I can't go very far before it tightens up.Back in the original direction, free at first then tight where it was before I started.  So The ENGINE IS NOT SPINNING FREELY.  Crap!  We've just crossed into an area where I know nearly nothing.  Bolt on/Plug in part I'm good with; Internal engine stuff not so much.

So can someone break it to me gently?

Thanks again
PM
