Subject: What's the practical low end for the endplay spec?

The endplay spec is 0.07mm to 0.13mm which is 0.003&quot; to 0.005&quot; according to the book specs. If you do the actual conversion it's closer to 0.00276&quot; to 0.0051&quot;. What concerned me for a while was that the rounding of the units have produced one value at the lower limit that is smaller than the other. I checked without guesswork and the metric values seem to be the baseline...

It was 0.15mm before I removed the flywheel to replace the seal and I suspect that was probably the cause of the tapping noise I used to here at startup and possibly the cause of my flywheel seal leak (got pounded by the crank).

Reseting it to 0.09mm seems a better choice to me. What do you think? I don't want to end up going too tight in practice even though it would be ok going by the book.
