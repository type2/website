You may be right. Too much advance causes pre-ignition. I have been 
told by a few mechanics that retarding advance slightly below what it 
should be will buy a few degrees in head temp readings. If you go too 
low than that could cause incomplete combustion resulting the gases 
burning in the exhaust manifold which could heat the head.

Perhaps one of men of science of the professional mechanics on the 
list can weigh in on this.
