Subject: Front door hinge differences

    I took advantage of the BB posting about buses for parts in Ft. Pierce,
Florida. I got 2 front doors without rust to replace the very rusty ones on my
'77 Westy.
    The acquired doors have the old style door locks by the inside handle,
that I liked so much on my old '72. I live in South Florida and like to leave
the jalousies open to cool the camper, but always worry about someone pushing
in a screen and pulling up a lock button on a front door window ledge of my
'77.
    The doors' hinges are different, however. I really want to use these newly
gotten doors. What can I do to make them work?

Thanks,
            Mike
P.S.: Sorry to refer to coping with the heat, while so many of you are still
shivering.
