&gt; VW should have understood the American market better than they did

VWoA were/are dopes. Their idea of improvement is re-badging an  
existing car. e.g. Rabbit.

&gt; It would not have had to be the highly developed Porsche 911 flat- 
&gt; six, but something more along the lines of a flat 6 Type IV engine  
&gt; based on 2.0L pistons and cylinders. That would be a 3.0L engine  
&gt; that would have been much less stressed and would have prob lasted  
&gt; forever. Add a 5 speed tranny rather than a 4 speed.

In the 80s, Oettinger did this with the Vanagon albeit with an  
automatic and turned a 2.1L into a 3.2L.

As I understand it, VW cancelled the program they codeveloped, so  
Oettinger bought the tooling and sold it themselves.

&gt; Am wondering if it was a lack of understanding (maybe the Germans  
&gt; basically designed these vans as city vehicles whose 110 kph  
&gt; abilities were rarely needed), a bean counter's decision to save  
&gt; some cash by using their car parts in the vans too, or  what?

  As far as I know the Europeans are still only exporting a subset  
the models they build in Europe. It appears to be a mentality.
