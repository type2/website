Subject: 1970 Westphalia Pop-top

Thinking of making a commitment to an additional Westy.  My current version is
a 1970 stock westy without the pop-top.  I've been looking at another 1970
Westy that has got the pop-top but the canvas is shot.  Any ideas on the cost
and labor associated with replacing?  Are replacement pieces readily
available?  How practical is the sleeping area up there for an 8 and 10 year
old?

Appreciate any input,

Juan
