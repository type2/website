&gt; 10 or 12 sets of points later, and you could have had yourself a new

&gt; original.  Anybody care to expand on why you would want to keep your
&gt; points(beyond the need out of necessity)?

Well, I've never really had any problem with them!  I gap them with dwell
(yes, it's a hassle) and they stay pretty much stable for many thousands
of miles.  If I have a problem, I can probably fix it with materials at
hand without re-engineering my ignition system.

I tried a pointless conversion (Per-Lux) on another vehicle and went
through two units before I gave up and went back to points.  the
aggrivation was not worth the lack of point adjustment.  I probably
had bad luck, but I've just never seen the need to try again
