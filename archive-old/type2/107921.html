Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Servo 1973 - Problems

&gt; I was installing a new master cylindar on my bus and I noticed that brake
 fluid was coming out of the rear of the master cylinder and leaking into the
 servo.  Is this normal?

NO, you have a bad master cylinder.

&gt; I know the servo works on vacume  [VACUUM] {and NOT}
 pressure and though it was strange to have fluid inside it.  The level is
 about 1 inch below where the hole for the master cylinder mounts to.  Any
 ideas? or anyone run into this before?  Will the brake fuild damage the
 servo?

Any brake fluid in the booster means a bad master cylinder. Replace it.
Brake fluid above a certain mm level will destroy the valves in the booster. If yours is an inch below the big
hole, I would NOT use it. How did you even get the bus to stop?? That much fluid will cause a hydraulic lock
and the master will not move before the pedal travel locks up.
Replace the booster now.
