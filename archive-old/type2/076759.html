Subject: Type4/Deutsch oil filter..read this if you have one on your bus. :)


Hey folks..I've got two filters sitting on the shelf here, a D404 and a
D336...Both Deutsch.

Anyone who has a Deutsch on their bus or vanagon wanna tell me which one
you have?  These are all short-n-fat so i know they had to be bought for
either the '72 or the '82...And i need to go change the oil on moms
vanagon this weekend.

Anyway.  Or if anyone has a Deutsch reference book on hand...heh.

thanks guys.

...david
