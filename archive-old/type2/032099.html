Subject: Re: Canvas Install

&gt;      I found one of your posts about installing pop top canvas in the
&gt; type2 archives. I just bought new canvas from Bus Depot, same as you
&gt; did. I am told by some folks it can't be installed like the original
&gt; at the top, with the plastic strips folded up under, just staple the
&gt; canvas then the plastic strips on top, where they will be visible. Is
&gt; this how you installed yours?

Dear Jeff,

I could have installed mine more elegantly. I did not make a careful study
of the way the original was installed before I removed it (duh...). I
think the original is probably like this: C = canvas, P = plastic strip, #
= poptop

Staples pass through the plastic strip, one layer of canvas and into the
poptop. The innermost fold of canvas thus hides all staples from view
inside. It is obviously true that a canvas could be installed like this if
someone wanted to, since the original Westfalia factory turned out
hundreds of thousands of these. It might be the case that this style would
be more trouble than it's worth for a one time do-it-yourself project.

I installed mine like this:

Carpet tacks pass through plastic and two layers of canvas into the
poptop. Nails are clearly visible from inside the poptop. No stapler I
owned or could borrow was strong enough to punch through the old and stiff
plastic strip, so I used carpet tacks.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

I gather that you are talking about an installation that looks like this?
No folds in the canvas. Or maybe just like I did it?

If you installed like the last illustrated example, you'd probably have a
little too much canvas to deal with at the bottom. As I understand it, the
only reason to fold at the top at all is to adjust the length so the thing
fits well. It's easier to take in extra fabric at the top than at the
bottom, seems to me. Your actual mileage may vary.

Hope this helps.

Good luck,
