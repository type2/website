Bulley's post gave me an idea (although someone must have already thought 
of it).

Soundblaster diagnostics.

If there were a web page that had soundblaster wave charts of VW engines 
in various conditions and states of tune, each could be labeled according 
to characteristic patterns: peaks for rod knock, lifters, etc. 

Then, with a fairly inexpensive cassette recorder, one could tape the 
sound of one's engine, play it back into the sound program, and compare 
the strips.

What would be important, I think, would be to select the ideal (inexpensive) 
microphone or pickup, and to standardize the location for placing the 
pickup.

(The Muir sounds webpage would be a good place to begin).

There has *got* to be someone on the list who ran/runs sound for 
musicians. Audio engineers?
