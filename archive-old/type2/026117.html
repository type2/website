Something to note if you are using a cheap torque wrench - make sure it
is calibrated, not just at one setting but throughout the range.  If
it's not calibrated, make a note of what setting you need to get the
actual torque and put it on a sticker or something.  I used a spring
balance to calibrate mine but there are probably lots of more accurate
methods.
