Sounds dangerous to me Dave.  I'd have the complete front end looked at by
someone who does that for a living.  Or you might not be...  (Ball joints,
tie rod ends, axle beam (rot), loose wheels, my guess there's something
loose in there that takes up the slack when enough lateral force kicks in.)
Good luck.
