Message-ID: &lt;37024b3871 Westfalia progress (longish)*_at_m400gw.wiley_dot_com&gt;

What seems to be a finished and tuned motor turned out to be NOT. brakes when 
bled just dribbled some black puss-like substance from the back bleeders, the 
fronts gave a blast of air followed by a lighter brown rust colored fluid. 
Resevoir level did not drop appreciably after going around the wheels twice. 
looks like a major clog in there. was able to adjust one back set of shoes 
but second rear backing plate access holes are chewed beyond recognition, 
also I can hear some springs making noise in there. did successfully R&amp;R the 
servo though, so have something to work with. 

Another issue will be seat belts, both anchor plates are rusted through and 
the seatbelts are of course not operational. Not a good situation for women 
and children and other living things or whatever that poster used to say.

 34.3 combined with the stock distributor with all new tuneup parts has yet 
to perform adequately. The 34.3 is probably the problem, as the timing, valve 
settings &amp; compression are all on the money.  I've run through the series of 
moves one can perform on a used carb, cleaning and replacing the diaphrams 
etc. 2.5 hours of tuning behind a running motor last night with the tach 
hooked up trying to adjust carb per procedure design for a rebuilt version 
produces no appreciable changes. Still have a major dead spot similar to 009 
but slightly more mid-range on the advance curve with a little intermittant 
backfireage.

Disabled the choke as it wasn't opening possibly due to excess play in the 
step down cam. Once it warmed up a test ride of 10 minutes produced the red 
light and stalling at stops. many people have sworn by the 34.3/stock 
distrib. combination, where I have always taken a position antithetical to 
that which is mostly personal. Regardless, I continue to try to make it work, 
but slowly think about the alternatives, my trusty 009 combined with a 30pict 
carb 1 or 2 carb on an adaptor plate, with perhaps some drilling of the 
accel. pump hole, or a new 34.3, which I could not bring myself to buy to buy 
due to an unnatural aversion involving historical issues in my personal 
history, ie, they've never worked right for me, and I refuse to sucker for a 
new one.
