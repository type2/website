! I used bowl wax that is made to seal
&gt; your toilet to the plumbing in the floor. Available at any hardware store for
&gt; about $1.00. Highly recommended. Warning - is flammable (like a candle) and
&gt; messy to clean up.

Actually, bowl wax is allegedly beeswax, if the label is to be believed.
