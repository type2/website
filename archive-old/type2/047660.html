Subject: [T2] Correct Tires

Please p-mail me if you have recently (last couple months) purchased
185R14 or 185/70R14 tires for your bus.  I'm looking for particular
brand and model information.

I have spoken with the tire dealer I normally deal with, he hasn't tried
to sell me something in stock or persuade me to use a different size,
but he is having trouble finding something in this size to order.  I
figured if I could point him to a specific brand/model, he might be able
to help me.

The problem with some of the tires mentinoned in the archives is that
they are no longer available, or so I'm being told.

TIA,
