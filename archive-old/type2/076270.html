Subject: Re: [T2] Which meter to buy

I have that RS digital meter. I doesn't shut itself
off and if you aren't careful to turn it off between
uses, you'll be replacing the button batteries
everytime just to read 12v dc. Call me ol' fashioned,
but I like the analog models better for bus work. (It
is nice and compact tho.)


I have another one from radio shack that's a tiny
little 
thing..
wallet sized.. you might want to check if they have
them.  It uses
button cells and tests resistance and continuity
(beeps).
