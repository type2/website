&gt; &lt;&lt; he only drawback I can identify is the very high cost of the gel-cell
&gt;  batteries... &gt;&gt;
&gt; thing is mine has a 6 year warrenty, haven't seen a standard battery that 
&gt; promised to last that long. It also has 800cca. but is is just an average 
&gt; size battery, unlike the giant lead-acid batteries with an 800cca rating. it 
&gt; did cost me $100 though.

The ordinary battery I bought at Pep Boys had a 75 month warranty, which
is a bit more than 6 years.  It cost about $45 or so.

Also, I'm fairly sure that Pep Boys will still be around in 5 years or so
to honor their warranty, should the need arise.  I'm not so sure about the
&quot;boutique&quot; battery makers surviving.

As far as huge CCA numbers, unless you're cranking a big Diesel or live in
the Yukon, your bus just isn't all that demanding.
