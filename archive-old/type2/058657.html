Subject: Valve Seat

All, my hesitation and stuttering was due to a lack of a intake valve seat
on #1.  It is becoming recessed into the head.  Tom Wilson noted that valve
seats were difficult to do and that a local machinist would probably have a
hard time...

I am real low on cash and can't really afford to do the right thing and
order a new head.  Does anyone know of someone in the central Florida area
with a decent used one?  I have made several phone calls to no avail.  It
seems the local FLAPS want around $150 for a new head and $90 for a rebuilt!!!

I really need to get on the road.  Thanks to all for their advice, and I
was wondering if this is a common occurrence?  

Thanks again,

Brian Allen
