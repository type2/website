My 1970 Bus is for sale, it is green with an extremely solid body for living
in NE OH.  It has a few tiny rust spots which I have dabbed some Por15 on to
&quot;buy some time&quot;.  It has a 1600cc DP with dual kadron carbs and  runs great.
Transaxel was rebuilt 2/00 and all shift rod bushings were replaced, it
shifts smooth and doesn't pop out of gear anymore.  The front seats need to
be reupholstered but the others seats look great, headliner has a small
tear.   New brakes all the way around including master cylinder.  This bus
is ready to go anywhere day or night, it's been garaged since 10/00. This
Bus is very clean and solid for the Midwest.  It's only been in the snow
once since I've owned it and wouldn't you know that I got behind a salt
truck that day and almost cried as I drove to the nearest carwash.  I'm
letting this one go due to my other projects which need my attention.  I'm
asking $3,800 obo, I have a digital camera so if anyone is interested in
pics just give me a shout and I'll take some and send them off.  Thanks,
Marcus
