Subject: Interchanging instrument clusters?

I have the chance to get the deluxe9 Vanagon dash cluster with the tach.
Currently I have the basic model with the blank space where the clock/tach
should be.  Question is how easy would it be to switch in the upgrade .
Mine9s an 80 (air cooled T IV) and the donor9s a 84 or 85 (Wasser), but I
see no differences in the cluster.  My buddy thinks I may even have the tach
wire already, since VW didn9t want to waste time in rewiring every other bus
for the special feature.  If not, what is involved with setting that up?
Also can I roll back the mileage to be accurate?  Mine has 90K and donor has
120K.  Thanks, Nik
