I would strongly distrust any price less that $1500 for a pancake. But
that isn't what you asked. So ask them:

The source of the pistons and cylinders
Did MSHP do the heads? If not, who did?
New oil cooler?
Balanced to what tolerances?

And

What warrantee?
Would they give you the names of some clients that you could call for
references (ideally, people who have had their engines for more than a year)?
