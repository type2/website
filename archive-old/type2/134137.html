Subject: water injection was Re: Strange thoughts when bored at work...

Hi Don

On 05/15/04, you wrote:

&gt; So I've been sitting here since 6am. It's now noon. Taken like 8
&gt; calls all day so far. Started off thinking about working on the bus
&gt; tomorrow, but my thoughts started skating off in really odd
&gt; directions (nothing I'd ever really try, but piqued my curiousity):

&gt; Assuming it could be perfectly sealed, how well would keeping the
&gt; cylinders and heads in a waterflow work?

It occurs to me that this is a much more elaborate idea than a
watercooled engine with the waterjacket incorporated.

Another thought might be something like a mechanic I knew once did
with his Triumph TR-7, way back when, to increase fuel economy.

He mounted a bottle under the hood and ran a piece of tubing to a
vacuum port on his carborator.  He used an aquarium like tubing valve
to control the flow.  He put water with a bit of alcohol in it
(alcohol keeps things clean).  He varied the amount the valve was opened.
Of course, you need to add more water mixture when you fill your tank.

The water minimized ping and without ping the engine ran cooler, with
a bit more hp and better mpg.  I imagine it would help reduce engine
deposits too.  Even if you don't hear ping you may have some
pre-ignition.

I can think of a few places I might route a similar water injection
into my 2.0 L fi and may try it to see if it improves things any.


(BTW, put an aquarium airator stone (not sure if that will work) 
or some other filtration method on
the end of the tubing in the bottle to keep crud from getting in the
line.)


Sincerely,
