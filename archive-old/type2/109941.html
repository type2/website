Subject: Re: [T2] Oil breather questions

&gt; In one sense this is normal but just because it is normal does not mean
&gt; that it is good.  You should put a leak-down test on your todo list 
&gt; with
&gt; the expectation that your engine will not fare well.  I believe that 
&gt; you
&gt; are correct that your leaking oil cooler gaskets and oil-soaked hose 
&gt; are
&gt; related.  As the blow-by gets worse sealing the breather only increses
&gt; pressure inside the case and forces oil past seals.  These include the 
&gt; oil
&gt; cooler seals, the front and rear main seals, and the pushrod tube 
&gt; seals.

So, my leak-down test results came in today.  My engine, in fact, did 
not fare well:

#1 - 30% at intake valve
#2 - 40% at rings
#3 - 40% at rings
#4 - 40% at rings

So, I'm going to bite the bullet and just get a new engine:

	- Why spend the $$ fixing the oil leaks in this one when
	  it still has all the underlying problems.

	- New engine is not that much more than a top-end rebuild,
	  so might as well go all the way (and get the warranty on
	  top of it all).

Buslab (who is doing the work for me) uses JCS (apparently just north 
of LA); they swear by 'em.  Anyone have pointers to JCS on the web so I 
can read up about them?

In any case, by mid next week, my engine troubles should be a thing of 
the past (lemme give the wooden desk 3 knocks, just to be safe :-)
