Subject: [T2] Lifetime warranty rant (was RMMW)

&gt; Prices may be steep, but everything comes with a lifetime
&gt; warranty, which I am unable to find elsewhere....


And how much are you really paying for that lifetime warranty?

A &quot;lifetime warranty&quot; can be an effective marketing tool that obscures the
real issues of price and quality.
But it is no substitute for parts quality.  And neither is it free.

The price you pay must be significantly higher to fund that &quot;lifetime
warranty.&quot;  Essentially, you are buying &quot;insurance&quot; or an &quot;extended
warranty&quot; with your part, built right into the price that you pay.  If you
are getting a like quality part, and actually make use of the lifetime
warranty, then maybe it was worth it.  (Consider the limitations and costs
of using it, though: see below.)  If not, then it wasn't.  Are you the type
who always says &quot;yes&quot; to the &quot;extended warranty&quot; at Circuit City on every
piece of electronics, computer gear, appliance, etc. that you buy?  Then
maybe paying a lot more for a &quot;lifetime warranty&quot; is worth it to you.  This
is exactly the same thing, except that rather than being broken out as a
separate charge as it is at an electronics store, it is hidden in the price
so you don't know what it is costing you.

But wait, some prices do not appear to be significantly higher?  Why?

Because rather than fund your &quot;free warranty&quot; by charging a lot more for
that part, the vendor has simply substituted a lower quality part for about
the same price.  This is what happens much of the time, and is the real risk
in my opinion.  U.S. made resurfaced brake shoes for the same price you
could have paid for brand new German ones.  Aftermarket Brazilian body
rubber for the same price as genuine VW seals.  Brazilian or Mexican
mufflers for the same price as German ones.  And so on.

So for the same money, you have received a part that will very possibly wear
out notably sooner (and perhaps not fit as well either).  But wait, you have
a lifetime warranty!  When that inferior part fails, you can simply get it
replaced for free, right?

Okay, say the Brand-X wheel bearing that you bought wears out (much sooner
than an OEM one might have, of course).  You now have to take the time and
hassle (or pay someone $50/hour) to remove the bad $10 part, and then pay
shipping _both directions_ to have it replaced (since the lifetime warranty
does not include shipping).  Then you have to hope that the vendor will give
you a break, because technically the lifetime warranty does not cover wear
and tear, just manufacturing defects; that is, if the cheaper part just
plain wears out, that's not covered..  Since this $10 Chinese wheel bearing
probably wholesaled for $1.50, the vendor probably will give you the benefit
of the doubt and replace it for you, given that the biggest expense was the
shipping cost both ways, which you paid.  So you'll get another Chinese
wheel bearing, which may do the same thing.

More likely, when the bearing fails you won't have the luxury of being able
to wait for a replacement, or will simply decide that the time/hassle of
returning it isn't worth it.  So you'll go pick one up at Napa for more
money, and never even use the &quot;lifetime warranty.&quot;  This is part of what
they're expecting.  It's sort of like how companies that offer mail-in
rebates know that a certain percentage of people will never claim it, which
is why they run a $10 mail-in rebate rather than just taking $10 off the
price.

The same scenario could apply to many of the other parts - i.e. the
time/hassle of removing your window to send back a seal that is starting to
develop cracks (whereas if you'd used the genuine VW seal it probably
wouldn't have cracked in the first place).  Or the time/hassle of removing
and reinstalling your exhaust system each time the Taiwanese or Mexican
muffler rusts through. I have a couple of customers who exchanged a
&quot;lifetime warranted&quot; Taiwanese exhaust system three times in three years,
before giving up, throwing it out, and plunking down $100 for my German one,
which they should have done in the first place.

Of course, this doesn't take into account the possibility that the part may
fail at a very inconvenient time, such as when you're on your way to work,
or when you're 500 miles away on vacation.   And it doesn't take into
account the issue of safety, depending on what the part is and what could
happen if it failed catostrophically.

What I'm trying to say is that a lifetime warranty is a good thing IF ALL
OTHER THINGS ARE EQUAL.  But you will rarely find that such is the case.  In
the vast majority of cases, you will either get lower-end parts for the same
price, or pay notably more for like-quality parts.  Nothing is free.  So you
need to consider how much you are really paying for that warranty, plus the
time/hassle/expense of availing yourself of it, versus what it would cost
you to simply buy a premium quality part with the standard factory warranty.
No decision is fool-proof. You could buy the proper German part with the
factory warranty, and you could just happen to get the one in a million that
fails just out of warranty. But what are your odds, versus your costs?

By the way, please don't construe this as an attack on Motorworks. I changed
the subject of the thread to avoid this implication. My comments are generic
in nature and apply to any number of retailers.  I am also not saying that
Motorworks or anyone else sells bad parts, etc. I am simply not a fan of
&quot;lifetime warranties&quot; in general, for the reasons I outlined above.  To me
it's all about price and quality, not gimmicks.

It's your money and your decision.  Be an informed consumer.
