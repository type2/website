Dear Shockless in CO,

Normally, there is no coil around the shock, so your old setup is not stock.
Some listmembers have had good luck with coil-over shocks, but others have
not as it ended up breaking the attachment points.

Shocks just act as dampeners, whereas coils lift the vehicle. Coil-overs are
often used to cure a sagging rear end, although the proper way would be to
adjust the torsion bars (or replace them if broken).

&gt; I purchased new shocks all the way around and started to install rears.
&gt; Mine are , like most I assume, spring over the shock. I compressed the spring
&gt; , removed spring attachment holder on shock and then noticed the other shock
&gt; has no place to attach the device that holds the spring in place to the
&gt; shock.  I assume I have the wrong shocks or are these superstar shocks and
&gt; you dont need the spring???
