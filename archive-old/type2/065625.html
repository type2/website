Subject: installing a tach

Hi All,
I'm planning on installing a tachometer in my bus pretty soon, and i'm
wondering how to do it.  I figure that it probably isn't very tough because i
think all it requires is running some wires, but i could be totally wrong.
 In fact, i probably am totally wrong,  so i'm lookin' for a little guidance.
 Thanks a lot.
also, would any tach work, like one out of an old ghia?
thanks in advance
