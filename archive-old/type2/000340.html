Just wanted to say thanks to all the folks that responded to my plea for
help concerning an odd power loss.. it was the air flow meter! I had an
extra (although not the correct one) and swapped them out. Ran fine. I then
cleaned all the contacts on the correct AFM and put it back in. It has run
fine ever since. Now I know for next time!

Thanks again,

Jeff
