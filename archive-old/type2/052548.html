&gt; Does anyone know where I could find a 71 DP intake manifold? I tried the Bus

&gt; it to fit. It previously had the stock 70 carb in it with the original

Any dual port manifold will work if you add the 1/2 inch vacuum port for
the brakes.  It would be a quick braze job and probably even could be done
with JB Weld in a pinch.
