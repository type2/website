Subject: Rear stub axle removal - stuck?

Howdy gang,

Nice to be working on a bus again and posing Qs to the list.  I feel 
like a real person.

Work is progressing on the 71 Westy 
(http://www.supernet_dot_net/~jclark/vw/71westy/index.html).  Since the 
photos and description on that page, I've:

- yanked the tranny and shift rod assembly all the way to the front 
of the car.  The shift lever base keeps popping out of the socket up 
front, and I think I've traced it to a bent front pin and worn-out 
pin socket bushing on the shift rod front end.  New parts on the way.

- cleaned up the engine compartment and prepped the area around the 
torn wheel well (see 
http://www.supernet_dot_net/~jclark/vw/71westy/71westy2.jpg for a 
&quot;before&quot; shot).  I am probably going to put a temp patch on that hole 
until my welding skills get up to speed.  The battery tray is 
long-gong, with an ugly but pretty sound fiberglass PO repair that 
should last a while.

- pulled the windshield, repainted the dash top, and am in the 
process of patching holes before I reinstall the glass with new 
rubber.

Since I have the engine, axles, and tranny out, now seems the ideal 
time to inspect and repack the rear bearings.  I have slacked the 
46mm nuts and pulled the drums, but the stub axles don't seem to want 
to come out.  What have I missed?  I did this job on my 68 westy a 
few years ago and although a major dirty PITA (especially those 
widowmaker inner circlips), it was pretty straightforward.

Also, my references tell me the '71 &amp; later uses a different outer 
bearing with a non-reusable race (not so on '70 and down).  Comments? 
 Experiences?

Thanks,
Joe
