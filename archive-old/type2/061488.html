Subject: Josh Rodgers

 I never got the opportunity to meet Josh, but have comunicated with him
via e-mail on several occasions. I feel that the Type 2 community has just
lost one of the most giving people. I had asked him about several thing
associated with my bus, and he always came through with genuine interest in
the problems. 

 Josh had invited me to join in his camping trips in and around Oklahoma
and also invited me to caravan with him and Rod Delgren to BBTA, but
misfortune prevented that from happening. 

 My heart felt wishes goes to his family and if someone would post when and
where a memorial/funeral will be held, I would greatly appriciate it.
