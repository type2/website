Subject: Re: [T2] swivel foot adjusters?

The point of rotating the valve is to even out its lubrication and to
even out the seat/valve edge wear due to hot spots.  In nonhydraulic
engines it is supposed to even out the wear on the valves stem/tip also.
    As to longevity, I am one of the few whose seats are outlasting the
guides; for that matter, my heads are working fine, but the bearings and
rings are wearing out based on lower oil pressure and some blowby. At
225K miles (my last compression check) adding oil got it from 135 to
160!
