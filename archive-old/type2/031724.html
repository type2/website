&gt; I understand the load rating d is better.
&gt; So my question?  71 westy, load d, but what size.  I believe I am
&gt; running 195R14 now.

ok tire class 101


size,  a bay van is able to use 185, 195, 205 tires without problems.
the number is the width of the tire in  mm

\70 or \75 is the height to width relationship in %

R -indicates that it is a radial tire

14 is the rim size in inches


so a 205/70R-14  is a 205 mm wide tire that is 70% as high as it is wide,
it is a radial and fits a 14 inch rim.


now on a tire are other ratings, most notably the weight rating which is
usually  number letter  such as 93P  or 99S  the number indicates the
weight capacity and the letter the service for which it is intended.

unfortunately the numbers vary by tire size as to weight rating

but a tire of 97+ rating would be adequate for most vans

so as an example I have been running 205/70R14 Michelin radials with a 99S
rating on my 78 bus for many years without problems

YMMV
