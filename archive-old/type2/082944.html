Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Valve covers - removal and replacement

Get yourself a brake adjusting tool.  It makes dealing with the valve
cover bails much easier.  As a bonus, you can use it to adjust your
brakes!  :)

&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt;
&gt; I agree with the &quot;Stock is God&quot; idea for the most part, especially when it
&gt; comes to my engine (T4 GD 2.0 FI).  However, since I replaced my hydraulic
&gt; lifters with solids, I've been dealing with issues of removing and replacing
&gt; my valve covers when adjusting my valves.  The larger T4 heat exchangers and
&gt; engine carrier make for a very tight spot, and prying the bail down and off
&gt; with a screwdriver (a la Muir) is pretty tough.  I would think that a pair
&gt; of bolt-on valve covers would be much easier, and the aluminum ones with
&gt; fins would seem to improve on VW's flat-black crinkle-finish steel.
&gt;
&gt; Do any solid-lifter T4 owners have any tricks for getting those stubborn
&gt; bails off and on when adjusting valves?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks and take care,
