Subject: Odd engine config and brake woes....

Friends,
I've seen plenty of T2 engine configs, from barndoors to '79's, but never
one like mine.  I don't even know where the cleaner came from.  I recently
purchased my '72 Westy from a dude in Jacksonville, Fl, about 6 hours away.
The engine is a Type-4 FI (obviously not original).  The odd thing is the
air cleaner:  It is an oil bath (round) mounted to brackets suspending it
above the center of the case.  the air is going in one SIDE and out the
opposite SIDE, where it connects to a normal-looking airflow-sensor setup
and then back under the cleaner to the intake manifold.  There is no aux
heater blower (the cleaner is in that general space) and the heater box
openings are loosely covered by aluminum foil.

I haven't really messed with the cleaner too much as I want to know more
before making a damn mess with the oil-bath (yes, I hated the one on my Bug)
Does ANYBODY know where this set-up came from????  Is this not as effective
as the paper-element setup?

Also- After having the master cylinder, brake lines, and the rear cylinders
replaced, my brakes seem to work fine.  However, when I have to press hard,
the brake warning light shines.  I know the fluid is good, I can't find any
leaks, what gives???

Thanks again,
Wade
