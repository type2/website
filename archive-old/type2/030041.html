&gt; Well, got around to doing a compression test on Wunder today - Between

&gt; WERE leftover from the '93 rebuild.  I'm very relieved!
&gt; 
&gt; Thought it would be a good idea to check the lifters, and lo - broken
&gt; valve spring.
&gt; 
&gt; My new mechanic pal sez he thinks the thing to do is to fill the
&gt; cylinder with compressed air to hold the valve in place so's it don't
&gt; fall into the cylinder.  Anyone done this?  How much pressure would you
&gt; need to make sure that valve didn't go anywhere?  

Oh, 50PSI or so.  You have to have a continuous supply of air as the air
will leak past the rings.

The poor man's way to do this is to take out the plug, feed in a few feet
of 1/4 inch nylon rope, and then turn the engine until the piston traps
the rope between the head and valves, holding the valves in place.
