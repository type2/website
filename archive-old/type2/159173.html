Subject: Re: [T2] DIY heated seats

Hi James,

I used a 12V seat heater this winter in the westfakia on the way to  
the True Canadian Winter Bus Campout... it kept my butt toasty warm.  
The one I used was a seat pad that was bought at Canadian Tire for  
about $20 or so.

For some reason I forgot to take it to EveryBus last weekend. DUMB  
MOVE on my part. Crossing the Allegheny and Blue Ridge mountain  
ranges we had wind and snow, both on the way down and on the way back.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; I know the weather is turning nice but nobody has anything to say  
&gt; about putting a heated seat kit in your type 2?
&gt;
&gt; I was thinking that maybe it all got missed at the end of my email  
&gt; from this morning on acount of the ADD.
&gt;
&gt; Check out the IPD website for some cool car accessories, including  
&gt; the DIY heated seats.
&gt;
&gt; Has anybody tried taking seat heaters out of a car at the wrecking  
&gt; yard and stuffing them in their stock Type 2 seats?
