&gt; &gt; What is the difference between and arc welder and mig welder?
&gt; 
&gt; arc welder takes skill, even I can use a mig welder  ;8*}

If you have to ask the question, you should run, not walk, to your 
local community college and take an introductory welding course!  Make 
your mistakes on their equipment and figure out what you want before 
you drop big bucks!

George, who can gas weld OK, but hasn't tried any of the new-fangled 
stuff.
