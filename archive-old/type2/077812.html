Subject: RE: [T2] Emissions parts vs. non-Emissions

&gt; &gt; I have a '78 camper and was wondering what was added to
&gt; California models
&gt; &gt; for emissions control.  I've seen a part for a catalytic
&gt; converter and I've
&gt; &gt; heard that the gas tank is different.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Two questions:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1) Can the converter be bolted onto the non-emissions exhaust?
&gt;
&gt; Yes, it takes the place of the straight pipe between the U pipe
&gt; and the muffler.
&gt; Ron at Bus Depot has a drawing of it:
&gt; http://www.busdepot_dot_com/partsimages/exhaust27578.JPG
&gt; You should have #5. The cat takes it's place.


Yes, as the aforementioned diagram shows, you can add a catalytic converter
to the 49-state setup, simply by putting it in place of the straight pipe.

However, while this would add a cat, it would not in fact make the setup
identical to that used in California.  There was a different layout in
California for '75-78, which used a smaller drivers-side heat exchanger with
the cat converter tucked along side of it (facing front to rear). The
crossover pipe was also different to accommodate this setup. The actual
California setup would require using that unique left side heat exchanger
(which we do carry but it isn't cheap) and the California-only crossover
pipe (which is no longer available).   I can't see any reason to switch to
that particular setup on a non-California bus, though.
