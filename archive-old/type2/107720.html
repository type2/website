 &gt;From 73 to 79, the front side marker bulb is in the upper turn signal unit. The turn signal has 2 bulbs in
it. A little bulb on the outside edge and a large bulb for the turn signal/flasher. Most are burned out and
people never knew they were there. #2 in this pic:

&gt; not in the USA, here the only thing in the housing is a dual filiment
 light bulb, one is the marker/running light and the other the turn
 flasher.  the little bulbs are the &quot;city&quot; lights never used in the USA

Sorry Bob, you have it backwards. You need to remove the lens from any USA bus and look. You will see the
little bulb for the side marker. Federal law required the side marker light. It is in EVERY USA front 73-79
light. Euro lights did not have the little bulb.
Yes, the large bulb is a dual dual filament; it is the park light and the turn signal.
Look at the 77/78 wiring diagram in the Bentley. M11 at location 31 and 32. The wires for them come from M1
and M3.

Like I said, MOST are burned out and people don't even know they are there!
