Subject: RE: [T2] Replacing Generator

&gt;From: &quot;Michael Hillier&quot; &gt;I have a 1970 Bus with a 1600cc engine.  I am an 
&gt;armature mechanic.   I know computers more than cars.  I love my bus and 
&gt;have done several easier projects like the tie rods,  CV boots, and basic 
&gt;wire trouble shooting and so on.

&gt;Recently the battery has not been charging so I replaced the batter, then 
&gt;the regulator with no positive outcome. So I now have a new generator ready 
&gt;to install.  Problem - Today when I finally got the generator loose, ready 
&gt;to pull it out, I discovered that there is a large bold holding the 
&gt;generator to the Fan.   I can see it but itbs larger than any wrench or 
&gt;socket in my tool kit.
&gt;1.  What size is that screw/bolt?


I think it is either a 32mm or 36mm. I can't remember off hand. But I can 
let you know soon.

&gt;2.  Will getting that screw/bolt off enable me to get the generator out?

Yes.

3.  Are there any other things I need to know about on this project?

Make sure you have the piece of tin cover plate that bolts to the shroud 
oriented correctly when you reinstall it on the Gen.

Good Luck,
