David had just finished restoring his bug and on the 5th day being on the
road he had a problem on the interstate and the engine quit.  Being unable
to get over as traffic was in his right lane he pulled it over to the left
side inside of a construction zone that had no shoulders anyway  Just big
concrete dividers on both sides of the road.
    A dual trailer semi came upon David's bug and the driver swerved and
missed the bug but the last set  of duals on the last triler ran over the
bug.  David was in a coma for a few days and things did not look good but
has since woke and now undergoing rehab at Immanual Hospital here in Omaha.
He is going to have some ongoing problems so keep praying for him.

Any info on helping Davids Lawyer determine the true value would be apprecia
