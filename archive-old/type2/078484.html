Subject: thanks, and a few more

fellas,

thanks to evryone who responded to my previous email,
a little reassurance every now and then is neccesary
for even keel. if it's quite alright, i have a few
questions.

first, a few weeks ago i posted an email regarding the
sanding and painting of my currently only primered 76
westy. to which i got some good replys, thank you
grant and terry. now, im wondering what is the
&quot;proper&quot; procedure for cleaning up all that primer and
rust dust. i would imagine it could booger up your
paint work pretty well if not properly handled.

also, just out of curiosity, how much horsepower does
a 2.0 FI 2000cc Type IV engine put out?

is there any power difference between one fron 76 and
one from 79? 

Thanks in advance. and all the best!

Matty
76 Westy &quot;Cleopatra&quot;
