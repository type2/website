Subject: Bus sighting: '72 bay w/Oregon plates in Washington, DC

So I am on my way to lunch today and there is a '72 passenger bay with
a home-made bed in the back parked along Vermont Ave near K street.  The
bus was white over primer with a nice sun painting on the sliding door.
Anyone we know?

This weekend, I plan on installing a new floor and some cabinets in the
1967.  It's going to be slow, I am thinking seriously of ordering the
plywood panels from Clara, and it will take some time to get them ordered
and shipped (I am *very* slow at considering and mail-ordering :-(

Anyone have anny suggestions on insulation to replace the stuff I pulled
out?  I am actually considering using the cheap acoustic ceiling tiles
with the &quot;surface&quot; stripped off.  It's stiffer than the bats and should
maintain shape better.  I do want some insulation, but want to make dead
sure that I maintain airflow and drainage.  I've seen the bulley-hewitt
bus project, but I also saw the pictures of what happened to that bus so I
will sacrifice the soundproofing for having the bus last.
