Hey folks,

I just want to say that Tom Wilson's book &quot;How to Rebuild Your Air Cooled
Volkswagen Engine&quot; was indespensible in my rebuild. Clear pictures of just
about everything you'd need a picture of.

Bentley had all of the info - but was dispersed throughout the manual.
Wilson's book is an absolute step-by-step on identification, diagnosis (should
you rebuild?), removal, tear down, reconditioning, reassembling and
reinstallation for ALL stock air-cooled VW engines.
Muir was there for me, but Wilson was clearer.

my .02,
clark

&gt; &gt;4.  Forget Bentley, the procedure is not complete.  Don't have a Hayes,
&gt; &gt;maybe it's better.
&gt; 
&gt; Bentley is great for clear photos and some info.  I had both Muir and
&gt; Bentley open on the floor of the bus, pretty much followed Muir.
