Good post. On the 73, I found that a quilt was all I needed to keep 
things comfortable. The fabric stores sell a material for inside quilts 
w/ one side shiny. I made a front curtain (just behind the front seat), 
with the silver side towards the front. It was light weight and could be 
tied up with some extra strips of material. The difference was amazing, 
even before the heater started blowing warm air. Cutting down the rear 
draft made driving much more enjoyable.

BTW, I also put some velcro on the bottom of the curtain, and some self 
adhesive pieces on the back of the seat, so it could be &quot;sealed&quot;. If I 
did it again, I'd put in some transparent plastic in the top/middle of 
the curtain, so I could see out the rear view mirror.
