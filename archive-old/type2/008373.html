&gt; ola,
&gt; 
&gt; 	i just bought a 71 westy and was just wondering about some things. 
i'm
&gt; pretty new to the whole vw thing so any help would be appreciated. 
first
&gt; off, does the 71 have any know problems with it ?

Yes, they're entirely too much fun to drive!

  also, should i be
&gt; changing anything right away ?  someone told me i should change all
the
&gt; fuel lines immediately which i thought made sense, anything else ?

Fuel hoses are good advice.  Be sure to get all the pieces, the really
critical one is the one from the fuel tank to the tubing coming out of
the front of the engine.

If any of the tubes come out of the fuel pump or carb while changing
the fuel hoses, be sure to fix them properly before driving.  I rough
the tubes up, clean everything to get rid of gas residue, then drive
the tubes back into the casting with a small quantity of fuel-proof
epoxy (JB Weld).  There are more sophisticated fixes available, see
the archives.

If your bus has any rust, be sure to take steps to fix or at least
stabilize the rust now.  Also, take care of any steering or brake
problems right away.  '71s tend to go through front brake pads
quickly, so keep an eye on those.

In the engine bay, be sure that all the tin is present and in good
shape.  Also be sure that the rubber seals around the engine are doing
their job.  You don't want to overheat come summer.

Congrats on your purchase, you now own what many volks consider the
&quot;best bus&quot;!
