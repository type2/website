&gt;The true shear bolts hold the column to the body. They are part # 211 415
&gt;549 and were used from vin #214 2164 060.
&gt;The bolt Brad removed is a tamper proof bolt to hold the steering lock to
&gt;the column to slow down thieves and has nothing to do with collapsing in an
&gt;accident.
&gt;When you get in an accident and you run into something in front of you, your
&gt;momentum and your body pushes the column forward. The shear bolts holding
&gt;the column to the body shear and the column moves forward.

Whoops, Karl may be correct on this one, having just chastised Steve,
this is Vanagon information.  The column is supported with 2 hourglass
torque to shear bolts, and the ignition switch uses a regular hex head
in the later years.

Sorry for the misinformation, but in a vanagon you definitely want to use
the correct bolts and not for anti-tamper reasons.  Those are not shear bolts
BTW in a strict sense they just clamp correctly and slip.
