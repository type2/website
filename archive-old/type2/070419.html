&gt;       This is an easy one [complements of Grandpa...I mean Bob
&gt;Hoover], take a four to six foot cheater and your bathroom scales [or those
&gt;of your neighbour ;)].  Put your socket and breaker on the nut so that
&gt;you are pulling up to tighten it.  Snug it up.  Now get on the scales,
&gt;and slide the cheater in place.  Grab the cheater precisely 4' out from
&gt;the centre of the socket.  Now pull that sucker up until your weight on
&gt;the scales increases by 67.5 lbs.  This will give you 270 ftp/lb of
&gt;torque on the nut which is close enough [a weight increase of 54.75
&gt;lbs will give you 271...if your bathroom scales are that precise ;)]
&gt;
&gt;All done, and you don't need no stinking big torque wrench.
When I have to do this on mine, this is the technique I plan to use.  I just
wanted to add that another technique that will at least get you pretty close
is to put a mark on the nut and spindle BEFORE you take the nut off, then
when you're putting the nut back on, just tighten until the marks line up.
This would be useful if you were on a budget and ONLY had the whack-it
tool.  (Sorry James; looks like it's too late for you in this case since
it's already apart.)
