Subject: Re: bus boat

&gt; Does anyone know anything about these? I want one.

I don't know tones about those &quot;boats&quot; that fir on top of the bus but I recall that for 
you NEATO members out there, there was a story about such a bus about 4 years 
ago in OBR. I seem to recall that the guy went up to Wash. state to buy it off of 
some retired Military officer (original owner) and that the bus was is very nice 
shape.
