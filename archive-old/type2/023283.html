Subject: Re: [T2] #3 cyl not pulling its weight

Do a compression test. Probably a broken (burnt) valve or a damaged piston 
(or rings).

&gt;I discovered a disturbing fact the other day.  My #3 cyllinder is not
&gt;contributing to the engine's power.  When I pulled the spark plug wire off,
&gt;the rpms did not change, whereas doing this for the other cyllinders slows
&gt;it down and makes it rough.  Engine does not run rough when the other three
&gt;are firing, although there is a little backfiring on decel.
&gt;
&gt;I ran the engine with the #3 plug out, and it appeared to be sparking ok.
&gt;plug was not fouled.  I smelled gas in the air coming out the spark plug
&gt;hole.  Any guesses as to what the matter is?
&gt;
