Subject: Re: [T2] Heater Flapper Boxes

&gt;You know, I have some flapper boxes from a 76 and they have the mushroom 
&gt;vent like you &gt;describe.  Are there supposed to be ducts that attach to my 
&gt;flapper boxes?

Hi Mike,

The ducts I saw were about 1.5&quot; in diameter, and they ran outboard of the 
heat exchangers.  They were metal, and they looked like little tailpipes -- 
kinda like the exhaust pipe from a gas heater.  When I asked the owner, he 
said they go to the heater flapper boxes, and they were there when he bought 
it.  They looked stock, and he had a 79 Camper.  I imagine these ducts allow 
waste heat from the exchangers to get dumped out into the slipstream when 
the heater is off.

The area where the flapper boxes live is a relatively large volume that's 
near the transmission, the fuel tank, the starter, and the front engine tin. 
  The mushroom-style vents allow waste heat to get dumped into this area, 
while the (I'm guessing) later-style vents allow waste heat to be removed 
from this area.  Blowing exhaust-temperature air into this area might 
contribute to hot-start problems, heat-stressing of rubber fuel lines and 
plastic fuel filters, and generally heating the front of the engine tin.  
Given that all of these are good things to avoid, it makes sense to me to 
get the heat down and away.

Again, this is just conjecture on my part.  Perhaps my thinking has a fatal 
flaw somewhere, but if I can drop a few degrees off my oil temperature on a 
hot August run, I'm willing to give it a try.

Since so much of the VW heating system has been regarded as a waste of time, 
I imagine these stock parts are pretty hard to find, especially if they're a 
1-year-only '79 part.  However, I'm sure you can fabricate a Kustom Waste 
Heat Transfer System from some flexible exhaust pipe. :-D

Good Luck!
