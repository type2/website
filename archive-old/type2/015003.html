I've always used a dual-circuit sending unit (2 posts). One side goes to
oil light; other side goes to pressure gauge. Saved me an engine about 2
weeks ago. Light on and I noticed immediately. Probably wouldn't have with
the pressure gauge going down. Turns out I blew out an oil galley plug; the
one kinda between the fan hub and the oil filter. Fix pending; think I'm
gonna tap it, but I'm a little nervous about that.

Don't fool yourself into doubling the wires on the same side. I think that
will give you bad readings and I certainly wouldn't risk that on oil pressure.

Thanks! Joe
