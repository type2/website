I'd like to extend an invitation to you one and all to
come and participate in a new website dedicated to
building an international VW community on the web.

We just opened the site on 12 April, 1999.

It's a members only site - BUT - membership is free!

We have several technical forums, a classified
section, Owners Showcase, and within the next few
weeks we'll be offering free e-mail accounts to
members.

We'll also be posting feature stories and photo
layouts of REAL VW drivers - Real Cars owned and
driven by Real People!

Our site is designed to be a user-friendly one-stop
site for VW lovers.

Come by and see us at http://www.bluebus_dot_org/

The bluebus is calling.......
