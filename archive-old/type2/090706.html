&gt; Not to defuse a brewing flame war, but Auto Zone will take just about

&gt; There are now smallish generators built for the sole purpose of taking
&gt; the offal from car maintenance, heating it up, and turning it into
&gt; electricity. Co-generation; the utilities are required to buy the
&gt; electricity back.

A lot of waste oil is sold for bunker fuel for ships.  Neat trick.  The
&quot;hazardous waste&quot; people get paid to haul it away (by an oil surcharge in
Cal) and then sell the stuff as fuel oil.  They get money from both ends!
