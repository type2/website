&gt; Following up my own post with more info.  The affected tires are the
&gt; following sizes:
&gt;
&gt; Sizes to be recalled include: LT235/75R15 (CR861 and CR857); LT225/75R16
&gt; (CR861); LT235/85R16 (CR860,CR861 and CR857); LT245/75R16 (CR861 and
&gt; CR857); LT265/75R16 (CR860, CR861 and CR857); and LT31x10.5-15 (CR857 and
&gt; CR861).
&gt;
&gt; The size they sell for the bus is 185R14C (H160)
&gt;

   FWIW, FTS, the NJ company that brokered the tires, has stated that it has
enough
money to replace &quot;about ten percent&quot; of the tires. After that it will declare
bank-
ruptcy... ;-(
