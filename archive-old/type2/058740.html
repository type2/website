Subject: Worms and Rollers

Dave and George, 

Not too sure of the years in which this applies but on page 23 in the Front
Axle section 9.2 of my Bentley states:

9.2 Adjusting Worm and Roller Steering

And then proceeds to discuss how to do it (including lifting the vehicle).
I think the free wheels in the air helps to better feel the resistance of
the roller or peg...

Hope this helps and best of luck.  Let us know how she works out.

&gt;&gt; David, my 71 had the adjusting screw on the drivers side near the middle of
&gt;&gt; the box towards the front of the bus.  I would think it would be the same
&gt;&gt; as in your 74...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Best of luck and I hope that works for you it was pretty easy for me and
&gt;&gt; did help.  You know you do have to raise both the front wheels right...
