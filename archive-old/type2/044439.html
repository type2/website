&gt; OK just put a new motor it went in while. Everything hooked back up. It

&gt; I have checked all of them. If i am doing something wrong let me know. I need 
&gt; my bus back running by monday since this is my first day of college and i 
&gt; need transporation. If anyone wants to give me a hand this weekend and they 
&gt; are in the Northern, IL area that would be great. Thanks alot

OK, no  spark on any plug.  Is there spark from the high voltage wire from
the coil?  If so, the problem is with the dist. cap or (less likely) plug
wires

Is the coil getting voltage?  Put a voltmeter across the low voltage
terminals of the coil, turn on the key, and turn the engine by hand.  If
you get a voltage that goes on and off then the points are OK and the coil
is probably bad.

If you don't get the varying voltage, then the points or their
connections are bad or there's an electrical fault in the wire from the
igniton switch to the coil.  Make sure that there's a voltage there before
proceeding.
