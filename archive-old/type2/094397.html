Subject: Re: [T2] Thermostat- to fit or not to fit?

That's a new one on me.  Never heard of anyone's flaps sticking shut before.

&gt; I called VEGE who advised me to fit the thermostat for all of the above
&gt; reasons and that if I check the stat and that the flaps are clean and not
&gt; covered in dirt and grime from the roads then they should always work and
&gt; not cause any great problems.  The cynic in me says that VEGE would tell me

If you want your engine to last a long time and function as it should, build
it to spec.  I'm with VEGE here.  You are building your engine now so you
can take the time to make sure the mechanism is moving freely and the return
spring is good.  After that, you should have no worries.  You don't say
which engine you have, but with the type 4 engines it's easy to check that
the thermostat is working properly by looking at the operating arm, and
giving it a wiggle every now and then.
