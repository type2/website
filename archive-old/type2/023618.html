To further add to the confusion, about 4 months ago a guy stopped by my house 
with a '78 Champagne Edition Westy he had just bought, wanted me to look over 
it. I was surprised when I looked underneath to find what looked like skid 
plates you'd find on a 4 wheel drive vehicle covering most of the underside. 
I'd never seen this before, and I've seen other CE's that did'nt have these 
plates. BTW, this was another case of someone finding a CE that had NO CLUE 
as to what it was! Damn that makes me made! And he only paid $1,600.00 for 
it!      Jeff S.
