Subject: Re: Double Cab Snorkel?

Karmonic generator.  You have a karmonic generator attatched to your 
double cab.  Since double cab vehicles are just WAY to cool for 
normal folk, they have an excess of good karma exuding from their 
inner being.  The snorkel is just VW's way of distributing the excess 
karma to others who partake in it's presence.  For who can help but 
feel enlightened, uplifted, and raised in consciousness upon seeing
a double cab vehicle.  Place your hands upon the metal, feel the 
essence, can you FEEL it, say YES . . . 

Karmonically Generating yours, though in a different language, the 
language of Detroit with the Ford dialect.
