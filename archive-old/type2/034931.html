Subject: Breakerless, electronic  ignition

Fellow listee,

Would you be so kind as to offer me the benefit of your knowledge? I have a
question regarding upgrading to electronic ignition.

As I understand it, CDI stands for capacitance discharge ignition and that
means that you no longer use a coil to fire off a spark but instead the CD
module has a healthy reserve of power that it sends, on cue from the points,
to the spark plug. The benefit being that spark strength does not weaken at
high rpm. But... my points are still mechanical.

I once had a Pertronix ignition in a bus, which I understand replaces points
with some form of a magnetic mechanism. In two years the timing never
changed. What I want is capacitance discharge ignition AND breakerless
points but I have never heard them discussed together. I assume it is done,
right? What brands work and what should I be aware of if I am planning to
purchase and install a breakerless CDI system.

Thanks,
Bob
