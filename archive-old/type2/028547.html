Hi all, renoir here.

75 tranny in a 71 bus.
On the way up to 5000' in third gear, i heard a &quot;ting&quot;, so i figured to slow
down to second
(i was going maybe 35 or 49mph). Could not shift to second, stopped and
shifted to first to get me off the freeway. Tranny was hot, first time ever.
I have taken many hard and long trips. After cooling drove a few miles and
could not shift into second. Stopped could not get it out of gear, then got
lucky and put it in neutral. Towed back to San Diego, thank god for triple
AAA.
Tow driver put it in first for stability. When we got home could not get it
out of gear to roll in driveway. Dropped motor. Now it goes in gears but not
fourth.

Pulled tranny, clutch housing, and nose cone. It looks like it is missing
ball bearings in front, only about eight of them and the bearing cage is
gone.

I hate going to a rebuilder but it seems i have no choice, do I?
When you take it to a rebuilder, you give them cash and then they say done,
you never know what is really going on for your dollars.

Suggestions are appreciated.
Renoir-a little depressed.
