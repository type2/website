Subject: Re: Whirring noise in back

&gt;Well, I found the source of the noise. It was the fuel pump. Imagine 
&gt;that?  Now for the real questions
&gt;1. should it run with the key in ACC

There is NOT an ACC position on a bus ignition!  Read that again, there is
NOT an ACC position on a bus ignition.  That is the RUN position and should
not be used for anything except running the bus or short-term use during
tune-ups.  Reason being that when in that postion, there is current running
through your coil and points and depending on whether the points are open or
closed at the time, you can ruin them in pretty short order.  If you like to
listen to your radio when the bus isn't running, move the hot-wire for the
radio to one of the fuses that has power all the time (and remember to turn
off you radio when you get out of the bus!).

&gt;2. is this original equipment? (cant find it in my manual but then again 
&gt;I never heard of a CLYMER shop manual)

A 76 should have been fuel-injected originally so would have come with a
high-pressure electric fuel pump (and should NOT be the same one you are
using now!!!).  When the FI was replaced with the carb, a low pressure
electric fuel pump would have been added.  BTW, Clymer is not the best
manual, but is much better than no manual.

&gt;3.and the $64 question do I need it?

Yes!  You need it.  That's what pumps the gas into the carburetor.  Without
it, you're not going anywhere.  As previous messages have stated, you
probably can't hear it with the bus running and as I stated before, you
should not be sitting around with the key in the RUN position.
