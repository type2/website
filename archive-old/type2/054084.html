Subject: reconsiderations for carb rebuild, coments please

Dear All,

A couple of days ago I asked for some advice on rebuilding my twin 
carbs on a 1979 2L engine.
Most responses were that I should get a gasket set and do it myself 
but I also looked at the possibility of having it done and was 
shocked at the price. then I realised what else is involved apart 
&gt;from cleaning and gasket changes.

Please correct me on any of the below:
Why should I rebuild my carbs in the first place?
1.) Fuel consuption should improve since it would finally allow me to 
properly balance the carbs.
2.) the thread to the electromagnetic shut of valve is gone when the 
jerk that changed the clutch ripped it off.. should it done it my 
self so this will need an insert. Cuold this explain why I am running 
too rich since then?
3.) the carbs leak a nit and I will need to get my brassbushes 
rebuild. ( is this true?)

4.) please add further..


If these are my reasons then a a clean and reassemble would solve 1) 
but not the others this would cost 15 pounds in gaskets.

I found acompany that will rebuild the carbs at 108 pounds a pice 
including the bushes or will sell me the kit inculding the bushes for 
80 pounds. sound good but are the bushes just a replacemtn job or do 
they have to ge ground out?

I also found a guy who is willign to do both carbs and an new insert 
for the cut off valve for 150 pounds.

I don't want to be throwing money out of the window, but id I touch 
teh cars I want them
sorted since the bus is now rust free had a paint job, a new 
Eberspacher heater and new self build interior. i.e. I am not going 
to scrp in the next forseeable future.

Now waht should I do and what is the harm in running as I am at the 
moment hoping that I can dodge my way through the geramn emissions 
tests?

Are the new solex carbs anywhere?


Any comments more than welcome.


Please reply also my pmail since I am on digest at the mo.
