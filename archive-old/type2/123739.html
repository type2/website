Subject: RE: [T2] Valves and TDC

When I put my pencil (actually the other end of my &quot;magnet on a stick&quot;
thingie&quot; and turn the engine, it gets crushed. I don't turn it enough to
actually crush it, but theirs clear and STRONG force coming from the
head side. Is that a valve opening, or what? Am I doing something wrong
or am I supposed to wait for whatever that is to pass by and re-insert
my &quot;pencil&quot;? 

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  try this. pull off both valve covers. Turn the crank to where the
#1 piston is near it's top. You can use a pencil in the spark plug hole
to help make sure. This is TDC. Now look at the valves of #1, while
moving the crank forward/backward about 20 degrees. Do the valve move?
if not look over at #3. If #3 move &amp; #1 don't you are at TDC of the #1
compression stroke. However if the valves on #1 move &amp; #3 remain in
place just rotate the crank 360 degrees.
