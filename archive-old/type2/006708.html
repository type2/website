John,

The replacement rear shift coupler kit that I installed was a piece of
junk, too. The long sheet metal screw that retains the roll pin is softer
than the pin so the threads stripped off, just like yours did. I wound up
reusing the original tube and screw. I think the idea of using a bolt and
lock nut is probably better.

BTW, when I asked for stainless steel safety wire at the FLAPS, all I got
was a blank stare. I used bailing wire and loctite.

&gt;I just had to replace this and used the kit... the pin that holds the
cage,
&gt;bushings to the shift rod came with a lag bolt to keep it in place.  For
the
&gt;life of me I couldn't get the bolt to &quot;catch&quot; in the pin, and just wasted
&gt;the first of the coarse threads on the bolt.
