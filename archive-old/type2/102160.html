Subject: Re: [T2] spilling gas

&gt;I've gotten into the habit of filling my gas tank to only about 3/4 
&gt;capacity because otherwise fuel spills out as I drive.  I have a 
&gt;permanent stain on the rear quarter panel below the fill tube access 
&gt;door 

I'd have to say it's because your gas cap isn't sealing.  I bought a new
replacement cap for my 73 several years ago and it has a rubber gasket that
seals to the filler tube.  This past Summer the seal split and now I spill
gas just like you do.

Anyone know if I can get a replacement gasket or will I have to buy another
cap?
