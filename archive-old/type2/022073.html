&lt;&lt;Are those the furnaces that cost about $1500 and are owner installed?
later&gt;&gt;

I offer these at a special discount to list members.  I have a couple left at
$625.00, which is $50 off my current web price.

The next shipment may cost  more depending upon exchange rates.

I have actually had e-mail from Europe requesting that I sell them the P4.
The retail price on the P4 and installation kit is over $900.00.  The dealers
in Europe do not discount this unit.

I have photos of my installation and the instructions posted to the web pages.
