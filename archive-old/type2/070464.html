Subject: Re: Help with replacing Westy top in 68...

wouldn't call myself an expert or anything but...

ht, all the tiny screws. But when we get to the top:
&gt; 
&gt; (1) It appears I have to take the rear braces loose in order to get the
&gt; canvas out intact, or install new canvas. But if I take the rear braces
&gt; loose I can't hold the roof up, so I can't remove or install anything at
&gt; all.

hold the roof up w/ a big piece o' 2&quot; x 4&quot; that's what i did


&gt; 
&gt; I'm reckoning the rear corners are the last thing you do, and it's done
&gt; with two people, one holding the roof up. Is this correct?

see above 2&quot; x 4&quot; recommendation..


&gt; 
&gt; (2) How do other people take all these damnable staples out? Just
&gt; screwdrives and pliers and patience, or is there a better way?

I used a flat screwdriver myself but a pair o' pliers would prolly work just as 
well can't think of any faster sol'n??
