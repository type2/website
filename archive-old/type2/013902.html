Subject: Heat Exchanger Question

Hello, I just purchased a 73 Bus that needs to have a new exhaust
system along with new heat exchangers replaced.  Not wanting to spend
several hundred dollars on new heat exchangers I was wondering if
there is on the market tubes to install instead of heat exchangers. 
The tubes would be like the &quot;J&quot; tubes for the type 1 engines but of
course would work on the type 2 engine.  Any help in this manner or if
you have a fairly good set of heat exchangers that fit the 1700 cc
engine I would like to hear from you.  I am not so much interested in
the heat portion but more for the exhaust so I can drive my bus.  The
heat exchangers that came on the bus have the ends rusted off were a
muffler is suppose to bolt to it so can't be used.

Thanks,

Kevin
