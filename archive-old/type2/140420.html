Subject: Re: [T2] Digital calipers

Mine came with a 2nd battery but turned out it was also low. A 3rd battery 
from ACE fixed the problem,

Phil

&gt; &lt;I had the same sort of problem with a wonky display and a new battery
&gt; fixed it up fine.&gt;

 Mine got a new beattery and then got put away for several months.

 Do these digital calipers draw power even when off? Mine says it is ready 
for a new battery again...

Otherwise good caliper for my needs. Checks out well against really good 
ones at work.

Chris
