Subject: Right rear side window installation (not)

We spent the afternoon trying (there is no trying only doing or not doing
yeahyeahyeah) to install my newly tinted right rear side window. It seems
like the durned seal is too thick (it's a Cal-look Wolfsburg West seal).
We'd get one side in and t'other side would just pop out. Really has us
hedgehogged. We did the string thing, but we couldn't get the window far
enough into the opening to get the gasket lip to pull over the flange. It's
a nice warm day in SoCal, so the seal should've been soft enough.

Any suggestions? We tried bein' nice, and nasty, and nothing seemed to
work. It's like the seal on the window as a package was just a tad too big
for the windowframe.
