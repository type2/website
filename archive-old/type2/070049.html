Subject: plug threads blowing out

&gt; could you just drive with 3 cylinders firing?  i.e. just remove the 
&gt; offending plug and limp home.

&gt; i have driven on 3 cylinders in my triumph; i have not tried it in my 
&gt; bus...it may not have enough power with only 3 cyl.  it could also 
&gt; unbalance the engine and cause wear...

Hi Volks,

I stripped a thread on my Subaru GL wagon once and drove it down town
to a shop (about 5 miles fairly flat) with the plug out. It was noisy as
Hell, but it got me there.

I recently drove my '78 Westy up a steep hill (about 1.5 miles and several
hundred feet) with one spark plug unplugged. Sounded like Hell and had 
very puny power, but made it.

Before my last rebuild, I drove Westy around for a while with almost zero
compression in one cylinder. Only 3/4 power, but it got me places.
And just before it died, my Subaru was running on 3 out of 4 with zero
compression in one due to bad rings. Hardly noticed the power loss then.
Sounded fine.

Can't speak to the dangers of wear and tear from being unbalanced. Can't
be real good for the engine, but you could probably limp quite a ways home
if you had to. Maybe one of our opinionated mechanic/gurus would share an
opinion?

My two cents,
Surfer Bob
