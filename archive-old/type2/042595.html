Go with the moly grease - it's what the &quot;bibles&quot; say to use.  When my cable
gave up last March, I tried some lithium grease I had on hand, but nixed that
idea pronto (gummy), so I bought a tub of moly for a few bucks but only needed
a small amount to get the job done.  Also a good idea to replace the flexible
Bowden (sp?) tube at the end of the metal conduit at the same time (Bus Depot
has 'em).
