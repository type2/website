Hiya All,

First off, I need to thank Joe over at Busted VW for his information 
concerning the Slider Hinge Link Assembly.

But now another question has popped up.  In talking to a boneyard mechanic 
about removing the sliding door hinge link assembly, he told me 
this.......................

&quot;Don't follow the procedure in Bentley (remove door, remove body track cover, 
remove old and install new hinge) for replacing the hinge link.  Taking off 
the body track cover (the screws will be all rusted, etc, etc,) will just 
result in a ruined track cover.  And then I'll be left with hours of 
adjusting the door.  Instead, just jack up the slider slightly, undo the 
hinge bolts from the inside and slip the hinge link assembly back down the 
track and (manuevering it around a bit) take it out of the track at the track 
slot.&quot;

Whaddyathink guys?  This is my first time at this particular job.  I don't 
want to mess this up.

Mike
