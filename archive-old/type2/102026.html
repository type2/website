Subject: Re: [T2] steering box

Hi all,
As Jim has so eloquently suggested.
Check your drag link ect.
Have a buddy jog the steering wheel left and right just far enough to 
demonstrate the slop in the system, meanwhile you shimmy under the beast and 
observe the linkages (belly pan removed).
You will see where the joints are sloppy.
I replaced my draglink and improved the steerability 95% it only took 30 Min.
Always check the cheap and easy stuff first.
Regards,
Tom
