Subject: Re: [T2]Blowby From Dipstick *(saga continues)

thanks john and everyone else that has shot me a reply and tried to give me some advice here..
i think i have tangled with this thing enough..
it caused blowby on my longblock and now is trying to do the same on this one....
we almost put another one(oil breather) like youre talking about on there the other day when we rebuilt it butttttttt i said naw i think i got my clean but hell how is a person suppose to know when you can blow through it its clean right ?? WRONG it seems,.,. maybe with a regualr one but yep mine use to be 76 fuel injected from PO so i guess thats what i still got on there... for now.. till saturday anyways and will have me another one one i know will be clean...
may have found a way to cheat till then though but will have to see how that goes tomorrow...?
 
now to get these darn points right? i know thats what has got to be causing the sputtering and loss of power until reaching cruise...? everything else is either new or rebuilt..?
 
once again thank you all..
peace and love
Chris

Hi Chris,

I think I wrote you when you were struggling with this last time. The
breather with the canister on top is good for fuel injection, but with
your weber you should be able to use the older breather that has the
straight through sheet metal work. Also hope your weber is jetted
right so you don't burn your new engine.

John
