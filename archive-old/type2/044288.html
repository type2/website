OK.  Time for the annual safety checkup.  Some of my previous encounters 
from just FOUR previous inspections

-  Failed  -  The light bulb over the license plate was burned out

-  Failed  -  I had 'cat's eyes' covers over my headlights

-  Failed  -  No light bulbs in the reflectors on the front door.

-  Failed  -  No EGR filter (Yes, failed safety because the emission 
equipment was not stock.)

-  Failed  -  Muffler looked like it might be leaking

-  Almost failed  -  Safety inspector needed help to find the EGR 'valve'.  
(He said it was on his checklist, and he needed to see it.  Obviously he 
should have been looking for the EGR filter, because the EGR valve is a 
little difficult to see/find.)

-  Almost failed  -  Safety inspector needed to feel the air flow coming out 
of my windshield defroster vents.  (Give me a brake!!)

Oh well.  It keeps things interesting.  I can't wait to hear the NEXT bad 
news!!

(I hope my windshield washer is not on the inspection list.  I might blow 
the inspectors mind as I pull the air hose into the passengers compartment 
to compress my windshield washer reservoir.)
