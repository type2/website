Subject: Re: Exhaust Wrap Good Idea?

This wrap(thermal barrier) works so well at keeping heat in, that when your
engine is shut off the inside of the muffler/header/manifold(whatever is
wrapped) stays hot for quit some time. During this time condensation rears
it's ugly head and since it stays warmer longer more water is produced. In
short any of the &quot;thermal wraped&quot; exhaust pieces RUST from the inside out!

&gt;Sorry.
