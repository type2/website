Subject: Hoover's bulkhead fitting

        I've searched the archives for the details of Bob Hoover's 
bulkhead fitting. What I remember (no doubt incorrectly) is that
you take a threaded lamp fitting and seat it on the cover plate with
a fender washer and a nut on either side. Then you pass a short piece
of steel fuel line through this and clamp hose at either end of the
steel line.

        Is that right? Is the idea to cinch the hose up close to the
lamp fitting so that the the steel line doesn't rub back and forth in
the fitting?

        I read that sermon long before I had a bus -- this is what I
remember. The archives have some discussion of whether it was an
original idea of Hoover's, but darned if I can find the meat.

Thanks
