Subject: Re: [T2] torsion arm install

&gt;&gt;for the top arm should I remove the torsion bar and put the 
arm on that then install that&lt;&lt;

remove the torsion bar?
just for clarification, are you asking should you remove the torsion leaves
that are inside the beam? if that is what you are asking, then no.

this is a recurring question/situation/problem.  i'm going to guess that there
were spot welds on the ends of the torsion leaves that popped off
when you removed the arm.  those welds need to be replaced before that arm
will go back on, else the grooves inside the arm won't match up to
the leaves. (AMHIK)

happy friday everyone,
