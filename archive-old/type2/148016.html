&gt;Greetings. I bought a 78 or 79 deluxe interior last Summer (can't
&gt;remember which) that I'm slowly getting installed into my '72. It
&gt;didn't have a table :( I hadn't really thought through how I was going
&gt;to resolve that. I figured I'd get the dimensions from somewhere and
&gt;cut a table top from plywood and lamitate it. Since I don't have the
&gt;table, nor have I had the opportunity to see one firsthand, what does
&gt;the mechanical connection to the swivel look like?

&gt;How does it connect
&gt;with the underside of the table? Could this be reproduced through the
&gt;local pipe/plumber supply or are these parts very specific that need to
&gt;be Westvalia parts to function properly.

I'll take a photo of the stand tomorrow...
