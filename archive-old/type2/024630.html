&gt;  How exactly does a new FI 1600 Beetlemex engine control its temperature
&gt;  electronically?

&gt;  

To start with theres the cold start injector to deliver extra fuel when the
engine is cold.

And in common with most modern FI systems the engine temp and air temp are two
of the inputs to the engine management system. As a lean mixture runs hot and
a rich mixture runs cool I assume it adjusts the mixture as appropriate - of
course this is within the limits of the emmissions control side of the FI.


Good luck
Bob
