&gt; I am in the process of redoing the fuel system on a 2.0 FI engine.  Maybe you
&gt; all can answer some qestions, please.
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  How do I clean my fuel injectors?  Do I soak them, wipe them down, or
&gt; just leave them alone?  if I soak them, in what?  There pretty grungy on the
&gt; outside, but do they even need cleaning?

        My fuel injection experience is with the Type III D-Jetronic, but
there are many similarities.  I presume that you have the AFC/L-Jetronic
on your bus.  D- &amp; L-Jet are similar in many ways, as both are pulsed
(not continuous) injection.  The primary difference is how each measures
(or guesses) the amount of air flowing into the engine.

        You should handle your injectors with care, particularly the business end.
There is a little needle valve controlled by a solenoid.  Don't mess with
the needle valve.  On the back end, where the gas enters the injector,
there should be a mesh screen filter designed to catch crud.  You could
look for gunk there.  I would only clean the inside of them by running
a name-brand fuel injector cleaner through the gas tank.  Is the business
end around the needle valve dirty?  That hangs out in the intake port
&amp; shouldn't really be dirty.  As for the rest of the injector, I would
clean it to my satisfaction with rags &amp; a light solvent.  Keep the crud
out of the needle end &amp; the gas entry port!  I've also had the electrical
contacts become corroded on an injector; you might want to clean the
connector with electrical contact cleaner.

&gt; 2.Anyone know what material the intake manifolds are made of?  Can I repaint
&gt; them? after cleaning them, a lot of paint came off.  Some of the metal looks
[snip]

        I repainted the intake runners on my Type III.  (Coral, yellow &amp; mauve, if
you must know.:)  My impression was that they got a bit hot for the cheapo
enamel Krylon paint.  Then again, I don't really know beans about
painting; that might have something to do with it.  You can get sort-of-high-
temperature-paint in several colors.  Think it's usually called &quot;engine paint&quot;
as opposed to &quot;exhaust paint.&quot;  YMMV.

&gt; thingy area) had a light film of oil or some such in them.  Is this
&gt; indicative of anything?

        Could it be gasoline?  Perhaps you have a leaky cold-start valve.  Hmmm,
guess this is *after* the flow meter, though.  Does your bus have an oil-
bath air cleaner or a paper filter?

&gt; 3.Do the injectors need to go back in the same cylinders?

        Nope!

&gt; Do I need to replace the little rubber gaskets?  Where can I find these?

        The gaskets are cheap (a couple of bucks).  A friend picked them up at a
FLAPS.  Perhaps RMMW has them???  If you've got the injectors out, you might
as well replace the seals IMHO.

        Hope this helps!  Perhaps a real busser could help out.  (Hey, at least I
drove a Splittie once!  Thanks Mark!:)
