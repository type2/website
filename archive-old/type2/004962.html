Is there any one on this likst in Eureka, CA.?  I have a daughter there taking an extended trip this summer.  It is her first time in California and she is having problems (minor) with her car.  Yes....... car...... it is not a VW,  she has not found her one yet....... although, she wants mine.(78 Westy)....we think all she needs is her battery terminals and posts cleaned.  She is having an intermittent problems with it starting...... sometimes it will........ then again......... not........ We were just wondering if ther was someone in the immediate area that would not mind, even though it is not a type2, possibly checking on this.  Or at least let her know there are people around for when she does find her dream ride... 
If so.... please e-mail me and I will let you know where she is staying.... 
thanks in advance,
