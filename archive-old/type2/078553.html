&gt; what does one use to conduct a compression test? you
&gt; gotta have the engine in the vehicle to do this huh?
&gt; any way to do it when engine is out? thanks in
&gt; advance.

well you need a compression tester.
few bucks at your FLAPS

you could probably do it without the engine in the bus, it is usually done
with the engine off and spinning it with the starter.

so by using a starter to spin it, or even possibly spinning the engine by
hand would give you some reading.
