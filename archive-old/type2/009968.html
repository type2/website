&gt; Cameron is much better (having had the cord wrapped around his neck
twice).
&gt; He has his Mothers glare &amp; his Fathers snarl! I can't say I blame
him, one
&gt; of the operations left his little willy black &amp; blue! (yow!).

Snarl is good.  Hope that you and Denise saved up a lot of sleep
during her pregnancy, as you won't be getting any now!

&gt; As for Denise, her blood pressure is better but heart rate is rapid &amp;
&gt; thready. We will not accept a Blood transfusion so she is on 8
litres of
&gt; 'Ringer's solution'. As it turns out most of the complications are
due to
&gt; the state of the Hospital. The first delivery room they gave us was
infested
&gt; with ants taking old blood from the delivery trolley &amp; all the
instruments.

GAD!  I'll remember that the next time someone mentions the UK as a
model of socialized medicine!  I don't even like to have ants around
when I'm working on my bus!

&gt; I'll give more news when I have it.

Our thoughts are with you!
