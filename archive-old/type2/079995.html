Subject: Wiring a spare (camping) battery in to a ’78 bus

O.K., I tried posting a similar question to the
Vanagon site some time ago when I had a Vanagon and
got majorly flamed as a moron etc. This list seems to
be a little more tolerant so I will try it here now
that I own a ’78. I saw a similar post a couple weeks
back but no one  (that I can tell) answered the
question so here goes…

I bought the Hella second battery kit from Ron (about
$20) but the directions are vague enough as to leave
me clueless on how to successfully wire a second
battery (Deep Cycle)into the bus for use while camping
(so not to kill the primary battery). I have read many
comments on these including this one,
http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/200104230337.UAA20751_at_lenti.type2_dot_com.html
,from Ron on the plus &amp; minus of them but can’t find a
thread on how (exactly) to hook it up. So… if anyone
out there would be kind enough to send me some
instructions, that would be really great. I am fairly
competent mechanically and can figure most of this
stuff out but reading the instructions that came with
the Hella – I am just to clear on how to hook it up,
gauge of wire, etc.  Please hold the flames, I am
already well done :-)
Al
