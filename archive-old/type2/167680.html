&gt; Well my excitment has turned to frustration.  Yesterday after replacing left

&gt; one at a time, but didn't notice any worse than the others  I had a new AFM
&gt; around (from another problem I misdiagnosed) and since the tracks looked worn
&gt; and the bus died when I moved the dial I figured I would put the new one in so
&gt; I could at least rule that out as the cause.  New AFM in bus starts and

haven't forgotten to plug in the AFM, sounds exactly what happens when
the AFM plug is out?!?!?
