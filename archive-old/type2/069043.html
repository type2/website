Subject: Tools for Rescue Missions (Compiled Lists)

Here's the original list and the additions. I just tacked them on at the end
of the file. Good ideas, guys! Thanks! Joe

&gt;-1 case Castrol
&gt;-90 wt ?hypoid? gear oil - what's the right tranny fluid for a '67 bus?
&gt;?where                            do you get it?
&gt;-jerry can + gas
&gt;+8-10' fuel line (what's the right size(s)?) - my idea here is to have
&gt;enough to  replace any old lines and to run up to the jerry can if I find my
&gt;fuel tank is  too crudded up to supply the gas.

&gt;-thick sitting pillow to minimize spring effect on my butt
&gt;-1x6x12 or 1x8x12 to make temporary battery tray
&gt;-bungee cords of assorted sizes

&gt;-coffee cans with misc. nuts, bolts, washers, etc. (the nuts &amp; bolts are
&gt;obvious, but the coffee cans double as a source of sheet metal if needed)

&gt;
&gt;Another indespensible object for pulling vehicles is a 
&gt;Come-a-Long, especially if it is wet or muddy.  Can be hitched to 
&gt;rescuer vehicle or other suitably fixed object.
&gt;
&gt;The gear oil, 90 weight, can be obtained with a self contained pump 
&gt;included, in the gallon size.  Check at your 'merican FLAPS type 
&gt;place.
&gt;
&gt;Rope, for tying things down.  There is one type (polypropylene maybe) 
&gt;that is resistant to battery acid.
&gt;
&gt;Platform for the floorjack, stout enough to support vehicle.  3/4&quot; 
&gt;minimum thickness plywood.
&gt;
&gt;Ice pick and misc crud pickers such as dental tools for cleaning out 
&gt;hex head bolts. Also a small paint scraper comes in hand.
&gt;
&gt;Spray carb cleaner for cleaning out hex heads, and cleaning off 
&gt;regular hex bolt heads.  Not only does the solvent clean, but the 
&gt;pressure blasts stuff out of the way.
&gt;
&gt;Cardboard is a cheap substitute for carpet for laying upon.
&gt;
&gt;Supply of those cardboard *trays* that are used to deliver 24 cans of 
&gt;ones favorite beverage.  Great for containing tools and parts, get 
&gt;greasy then recycle them.  Can be stocked WITH favorite beverage too.
&gt;
&gt;As for fuel lines, get a variety of small sizes, no telling what PO 
&gt;has in there, along with SMALL hose clamps for when the fitting is 
&gt;smaller that your smallest hose.

&gt;
&gt;--electrical connector kit (assortment of connectors, mostly female spade
&gt;connectors accomodating smaller and larger gauge wires; crimping tool; cable
&gt;ties; spools of assorted gauge wires, emory boards, contact cleaner spray)
&gt;
&gt;--VW specialty tools:  flywheel lock, oil seal intallation tool, 46 mm
&gt;socket, 36 mm socket
&gt;
&gt;--liquid wrench, anti-sieze
&gt;
&gt;--spare voltage regulator, fuel pump, fuel pump pushrod, fuel line clamps,
&gt;valve cover gaskets, points, condensor, cap, rotor, distributor, plugs, plug
&gt;wires
&gt;
&gt;--6 or 8mm (? I forget which) allen wrench for front spindle locking nut
&gt;
&gt;--steel wool
&gt;
&gt;--rags and hand cleaner (a lot of this!)
&gt;
&gt;--prayer book
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;       No CVs or boots- swing axle if its a Splittie, unless hopped up.
&gt;
&gt;       If its really running regularly, then you don't need a can
&gt;to dump the bad gas into, but a real salvage operation you'd want one.
&gt;
&gt;       I'd bring a hose, sponges, squeegee, bucket &amp; soap, and
&gt;a scrub-brush. I dunno, maybe some people would prefer it to be
&gt;dusty when first fired up... but driving home clean is fun too.
&gt;
&gt;       Battery postive and ground straps and a new tranny ground braid?
&gt;
&gt;       I'd bring a brake bleeding tool like the one I've described
&gt;too many times AND a vaccuum pump. Use the vaccuum pump to draw
&gt;fluid out of the system, rather than pumping, unless you already
&gt;plan to replace the master cylinder or its seals- old master
&gt;cylinders tend to tear when pumped vigorously after a lot of
&gt;crud has settled in the bore... if the system's solid but the
&gt;fluid's filthy, this would make a difference.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Don't forget a come-along - pull it out, get it moving, and get it on
&gt;the trailer.
&gt;
&gt;Berryman's B-12 - lots of naptha and keytones -will clean gunk off of
&gt;anything, but I like it to clean up and out old carbs.  Might not have
&gt;to replace your carb with the spare.
&gt;
&gt;Spare distributor - complete - to go with your coil.
&gt;
&gt;package of fuses or .22 long rifle cartridges.  :'o  &lt;&lt;&lt; ONLY ON FRIDAYS!!!


Thanks! Joe
