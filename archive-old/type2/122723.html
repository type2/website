Subject: Re: [T2] Pictures of my T2

See if you can track down Guerin in Lisboa. I don't know Portuguese and all
I could find on Google was a Guerin auto  rental agency. The name plate on
your bus suggests the camper conversion was done by a company called Guerin
though. You may be able to find more info on a localized search engine.

Doesn't look like much room for a bed up there. The top appears to
basically &quot;just cover the hole&quot;. A decent sized sleep area would need a
pop-top that covered some of the solid roof area as well, like the Riviera
conversion I just bought http://www.phorce1_dot_com/bbb8/DSCF0139.htm.

Joaquim Carvalho said something about RE: [T2] Pictures of my T2:

&gt; The top pops straight up but it's missing
&gt; two lifters and a canvas. I would also like
&gt; to fit a bed platform but I don't even know
&gt; where the top was made and where to get parts.
