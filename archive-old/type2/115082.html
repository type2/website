&gt; Get yourself a fuel line clamp.  Bob at VWTech was kind enough to sell

I also have real fuel line clamps which are great for changing the filter
but when you've got metal line all the way it's not helpful for changing the
hose coming form it. You need to plug it with something.

If you only have a little gas in the tank, I would try to jack up the rear
wheel on the passenger side to push the gas away from the pickups on the
bottom of the tank.

I used rubber gloves for years and got the filter changes down to an art
where I didn't get any gas on me. My dad refused to use them and one time it
ran down both his arms and they both turned red for a week.

&gt; Also - anyone attach an in-line valve  next to the filter so you could stop
&gt; the gas next time you wanted to change the filter? what kind of valve would
&gt; you use?

I had one from the plumbing store and the o-ring inside reacted with the
gas. I'm still looking for a real fuel line cut-off. Search the archives for
suggestions.
