Subject: Re: [T2] RE: '77 Manual tranny and engine into a '73 Bus

I mounted a 78 tranny in my 73 and had to get a new starter (you got that,
so good)

You will not be able to shift.  You will have to adjust the shifter linkage
at the front of bus.  IT is under the cab section towards middle of bus in
center.  Untie the safety wire (hopefully it is still there)  undo the bolt.
adjust linkage, drill new hole and install screw.  See if it works.  Adjust
moe if neccesary until shifting is right.  Saftey wire it back on.

I had to drill about 4 holes to get it right.

Good luck,
Snoopy
