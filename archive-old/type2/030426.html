Subject: Administrivia II- Going on Vacation

Volks,

On a separate topic, I am going on vacation soon, and will be gone for a
month, at least.  I will be leaving on June 28th for points west, and am
planning to return on July 5th.  While I intend to take a computer along,
I have done that before and my success at getting internet access from the
road has been marginal at best, so adminstering the list from the road is
not really practical.

So...  During my absence, George Lyle and John Anderson will be
administering the list.  To preserve continuity, they will actually begin
before I leave and will (I hope) stay on and continue to help after I get
back. Eternal optimist that I am, I would like to spread the load around
a bit :-) (Yeah, I know, management by committee :-)

                           H Steven Dolan
