The time has come to sell my bus.  I'll offer it to the list before
it goes in the paper.

THE GOOD
new tires, alternator, starter, front shocks
compression between 105 and 110 in all cylinders
body in fair shape with original red/white paint
original engine and tranny still very strong
all glass is orginal, so still has all molding
almost zero rust under windshield
no rust in sliding door area.  New mechanism, so it slides real well
sony radio/tape deck with 2 speakers

THE NOT SO GOOD
the body has only 3 holes, all in rocker area
one of the doors is different color red
the engine/tranny have 206K.  Still *very* strong, though

Oil has been changed every 2K.  New fuel lines.  Battery tray has small
hole.  Overall a very decent bus which could use cosmetic fixups.

Let me know if interested
Take Care
