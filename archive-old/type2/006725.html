Subject: TowBar

Just a note to prevent anyone from making the same mistake that
I made.  The tow bar from All Bug in Phoenix does not just slip on
the front axel of the 71 and later bus.  The brake booster is in 
the way on the drivers side and the steering damper on the passenger
side.  Several listee's responded to my earlier post, verifying that
the tow bar does indeed, just slip on the 70 and earlier, but not on
the 71 and later for the reasons mentioned above.  When I called to
order the tow bar, the man who makes them, assured me that it was a
'slip over the axel and put in the bolt' job, even when I told him
that I have a '71.  When I called him about my problem he still assured
me that it would work and that someone must have put a different axel beam
or brake booster on my '71 (not true).  He did agree to take the tow bar
back and credit my charge account, but it cost me $36 in UPS shipping 
charges to send it back to him.  Just wanted to let you know so you are
aware.

'71 Hardtop (not a pop-top) camper.  Kind of like shaken, not stirred.
