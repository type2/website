Subject: [T2] cheap buses down south

Hello,
I'm looking for the guy who was selling his buses super crazy cheap down
south (in Alabama I think) and needed to get rid of them really soon.
There was a double cab in there...along with some others.. A friend of
mine is very interested.

Please get back to me, or him at  jgbntr_at_super-highway_dot_net .. his name
is Jim.

Thank you!
