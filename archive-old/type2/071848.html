List:

I have what appears to be the remnants of an aftermarket z-bed on my '73 bus. 
The mechanism that allows the seatback to fold flat and even with the area 
above the engine is intact...but the seat bottom is not on any track and is 
anchored with the stock anchors...and when pulled out is about three inches 
lower than the seatback and engine area...so I'm missing something...anybody 
have one of these and can tell me what I am missing, or has a mechanism, or 
photos...I don't have the $ to buy a new one from Z- Products at $279...I 
believe mine is a Z-Products one.

Thanks much,
Rod
