Bob,
Thanks for the reply. Were the prices you quoted for one ball joint? Where did
you locate the torsion arm w/ ball joints already in them?
I'll check my sources and see if I can locate the bushings and get back to you.

Thanks Again!

&gt;I'm kinda going through this myself and have decided to take the torsion 
&gt;the ball joints can be pressed out while the arms are on the bus, but my 
&gt;local VW mechanic wanted $400 for the job. I can do the swap thing for about 
&gt;$125. I hope my bushings are good because I can't find anyplace on earth 
&gt;that sells replacements for my 70.
&gt;Good luck.

&gt;&gt;Has anyone any experience replacing ball joints on a loaf?
&gt;&gt;Must the torsion arms be removed fron the van as outlined
&gt;&gt;in Bently, or can the joints be replacedwhile they're on the
&gt;&gt;van using a ball joint press tool? How likely is it that I'll find
&gt;&gt;that the bearing surfaces/bearings on the torsion arm will be 
&gt;&gt;worn?

&gt;&gt;TIA, any help very much appreciated.
