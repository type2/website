Subject: Re: [VB] Camper Interiors

I'm pretty sure they make them for left and right hand drive buses - at 
least some of them do.  I know a lot of the interiors are getting put into 
Brazilian buses and I assume those are left hand drive - I assumed the only 
right hand drive buses are those built for either the U.K. market or the Aus 
market - if you look at a few of the U.K. mags you'll see a lot of ads for 
buses for sale - whole pages of buses exported into the U.K. from the U.S. - 
I assume (without knowing) that a left hand drive bus is as common in the 
U.K. as is a right hand drive bus - but .... I could be wrong. Its just that 
the U.K. mags show pages and pages of U.S. bus imports.

There is a company in Que

but I'm thinking about the vw specific stuff ...

&gt; for
&gt; left hand drive ?  later  mark  Dearing
