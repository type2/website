Subject: Re: '74 camper - rusty muffler fasteners

Hi everyone,

I have called a local VW shop and was told that they use 
copper exhaust nuts, so I'll go pick up a bunch from there. 
Also, I called an auto parts shop and discovered that they 
sell an anti-sieze compound called 'Copper Ease', which, from 
their description, sounds perfect for the job. So now I'm set, 
just have to repair the studs on the muffler, (I'm currently 
using another muffler I had spare).

Thanks very much to everyone who responded to my questions.

Cheers.
