Subject: RE: Rear Disc Brake Conversion?

I have often thought about upgrading my 71's front disks to 73+. As I
understand the procedure it would involve a change of spindles along
with backing plates, calipers and disks and would get you a whole bunch
better braking system. The front brakes provide a large majority of the
braking force - weight transfer, etc.. The last car that I did rear
disks for had pretty small pads when compared to the front. I would
think that increasing the braking power up front would be more
beneficial than rear disks.

My $.02

Excuse the band width if this is a dumb question but...  I was wondering
if
anyone has upgraded to discs on the rear. I see a lot of busses with
smashed
front ends, and a recent posting by unfortunate Jamey got me interested
again.
I know the emergency brake is a bit of a challenge with after market
conversion
kits. I am lucky to have front discs, I know, but would like all four if
possible.  Maybe I could snag a pair off a later model vanogan?
