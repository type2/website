Subject: a good mechanic in Montreal

I plan to drive my '72 bus from Montreal, Canada to Yellowknife,
Northwest Territories next spring. Yellowknife is closer to home, but
still 3 hours by airplane from where I live (Gjoa Haven, on a small
central arctic island thousands of miles from a road... I'm not
kidding). The bus is in excellent shape, in and out, and ready to go
except for the heating system and the traditional gasoline smell that I
want to fix before this long journey. Thanks to this list, I have a
pretty good idea of what should be done. I would love working on my bus
on my spare time if I was there but I obviously can't. All VW
enthusiasts with their loved bus in the backyard will understand how I
feel being deprived of the joys of riding (and fixing!) my bus. Does
anyone know a very good and imaginative and not too greedy mechanic down
there?
Oh yes...if you want a (long) ride across Canada next spring, and if you
enjoy pushing a bus occasionally and get your hands greasy, you're
welcome to join me.
