Make sure you use GL 4.
Not GL 5. Not GL 3-4-5.
Real GL 4.

&gt; I've been catching up on Willemina's annual maintanance, and am shocked
and
&gt; confused regarding the transmission fluid. My Bentley manual says &quot;It is
&gt; unnecessary to change the hypoid oil on 1970 and later vehicles, unless
the
&gt; oil has become contaminated.....&quot; Willemina is a 75. I'm tempted to ignore
&gt; this advice and go with my better judgment. Does anyone have an opinion
&gt; either way?
