&gt;Maybe Bob could get some more of those cans of expanding foam insulation
&gt;and report back how many it takes to fill up a split, baywindow and vanagon?
&gt;The units would then just be &quot;cans&quot; and eliminate the need for conversion
&gt;factors.  :-) :-)

I expect he would rather fill them up with flammable liquids, explosive
gasses, sidearms, ordnances and ammunition. While smoking. Or else with
randy stoutish Canadian farm girls. One objective volumetric measurement is
as good as the next, eh?
