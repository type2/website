Forget the convertible, my 2000 jetta for example- took it in for a bunch of
broken sh!t last month and the dealership didnt have ANY OF THE PARTS. had
to backorder everything. Im talking door handles, ashtrays, drink holders,
cheap plastic garbage that breaks in the first year after being used a
couple times??? What DO they carry, air filters and oil? I was told a
dealership had to have X amount of parts always on hand. Guess that aint
true.

&gt;When customers admire the convertible on the showroom floor, just point out
&gt;that you can't get most of the parts needed for that car at the same dealer
&gt;the car is sitting in.
