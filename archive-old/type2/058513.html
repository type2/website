Subject: 1776 or 1600

Go with George's advice stick with 1600 if possible, once you oversize the
crankcase there's no going back. I'm happier with the stock 1600dp I've got
in now than the 1835 sitting on the bench that came with the bus.
I will probably try and rebuild the 1835 as 1776 as a compromise,
reliability is my main priority.
I was once told that a stock carb on the 1835 would be starving it for
juice and after recent threads about various jet sizes and engine temps I
now wonder if this could have contributed to it's short life (more so than
that crusty engine bay seal the PO apparently ignored).
Any list comment on whether the 34PICT3 would need rejetting for a 1776 ?,
I don't really want to fork out for a single Weber setup.
