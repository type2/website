Subject: Re: [T2] Quad CHT gauges / OOPS!!!

In my posting on QUAD CHT gauges, the temp symbol
(Alt+0176) did not translate! Thus, everywhere I typed
a degree sign, it came through as a &quot;0&quot;. Sorry about
that! SO... 750 means 75 degrees, 1000 means 100
degrees, 500 means 50 degrees and so on and so on....
(!)

I guess I should have checked first. Here it is,
hopefully fully functional:

My Westach Quad CHT gauge came with 4- 48&quot; stainless
wrapped sensor leads. Whether it was supposed to, I
don't know. It is best to call a salesman at Aircraft
Spruce and talk it through. For some reason, they have
salesmen who are actually knowledgable and helpful!

My priorities regarding wiring were to get the
connector ends of the sensor leads away from the
engine compartment heat(the hotter the engine
compartment gets, the lower the reading on the gauge!)
Other was lowest possible loss of already very low
voltage in completing the trip forward to dashboard. I
bought a trailer towing multi-wire and some plastic
&quot;loom&quot; to wrap it in. I used 18 gauge wire and had no
perceivable loss (Yes, I did check it both with &amp;
without.) 5 wires are required - 4 individual (+)
leads from sensors and 1 common. You'll need to build
a small harness to adapt them all together. MAKE
NOTES!!!

My concept of the use of a QUAD CHT gauge is to track
tendencies and watch relative performance... That
said, if you have a VDO gauge on #3 cylinder because
it is hottest: Intake runner boot, Valve problem,
Rocker shaft / arm/ adjuster problem, head loose,
spark plug loose, no spark, loose injector, bad
injector ON ANY OF THE OTHER 3 CYLINDERS will not be
caught! With the quad gauge, FORGET THE NUMBERS! Watch
for the needles on the 4 faces to align. If #2 is way
hot compared to #1,3&amp;4, there is a problem on #2 (mine
was a loose injector!) If all shoot up rapidly, you
have a rag or the neighbors' new cat wrapped around
the cooling fan.

What do the numbers mean? Until you have established
your engines tendencies, they mean little. Watch for
deviant behavior of one member of the group. After you
have used the gauge for a while, the numbers will
start to mean something. The gauge is calibrated for
75degF cabin temperature. That is the temp that the
connector ends of the sensor leads need to be in order
for the numbers on the gauge to be accurate on a
Fahrenheit scale. If the conn ends are at 50deg, the
reading will be 25deg higher than actual; if the conn
ends are at 100deg, the reading will be 25deg lower
than actual. The temp of the gauge head doesn't
matter.

I do 99% of my driving between Seattle and Oregon
coast with a bit of winter mountain driving thrown in.
Seldom does it stay above 80deg for more than a few
days in a row, nor dip below 50deg for more than short
periods in winter. I placed all my connector ends in
the space above the tranny housing. I also added a
digital thermometer to check my thinking. The temp
stayed between 60deg and 80deg almost unwavering.
Exceptions were parking on a blacktopped parking lot
on a 90deg day, the thermometer showed 250deg but soon
dropped to 80deg once under way. In winter, it takes
forever for the engine / tranny combined heatsink to
get up to temp, so at 10deg outside temp parked at the
ski resort, it took all the way down the mountain
before the temp got up to 60deg! So what - head temps
weren't gonna go wild downhill in below freezing
ambient temp and I still had the relative needle
position to indicate a failure.


The late Joe Locicero taught me the trick shown in my
album - of notching the side of the spark plug well.
If you have ever used a VDO CHT gauge, you know what a
PITA it is to change spark plugs with the loop
connector bent up beside the plug body and the sensor
lead exiting through the spark plug hole in the
cooling tin. I was able to route my leads in nice
graceful arcs inside the cooling tin and exit at a
convenient place with a nice grommet. I added the wire
retainer clips to hold the loop connector in position
while the sprk plug is out. That required a tiny hole
to be drilled in the highest cooling fin (refer to
pix). I left the opening open but overlapped - just in
case I ever needed to change a sensor lead - and the
grommet hole is big enough for the loop connector to
pass through. (Aircraft Spruce is an excellent source
for grommets, also.)

At the gauge head, using the stock connectors required
way too much space behind the gauge (to fit on top of
dashboard.) I took a piece of 1-sided copper-clad
board (printed circuit board) and cut it to the shape
od the gauge. (Don't breathe the dust!) I used a piece
of paper shoved down over the pin connectors to
transfer hole locations to the circuit board. I used a
dremel to grind away copper in between sections for
each circuit. That is, I isolated each (+) lead area
with enough extra space to solder my wire to. All the
remainin area is ground and all the common pins to the
gauge are joined along with your single common wire
soldered in place. Only enough copper to isolate
&quot;islands&quot; need be removed!
I used a piece of 6mm SINTRA (an extruded foam PVC
board used in the sign industry) to make my holder for
on top of the dashboard. This material can be cut and
drilled with common wood tools - just don't go to fast
as it will melt and clog the tool bit as well as
re-freeze behind the saw blade! Use a heat gun or even
a gas stove element to heat-bend the base. (When I use
the stove, I hold the piece with long handled pliers,
well above the flame. Catching it on fire could make
for a messy house real quick.

Any other questions? Try a Google advanced search of
newsgroup = rec.autos.makers.vw.aircooled and use
parameters of busahaulic for sender and CHT for
content. Go waaaayyyy back for time span! 

If you want to monitor with a single gauge, but see if
something is going wrong on any of the cylinders, add
a EGT gauge. A single CHT is useless.

Also, T4 motors seldom lose bottom ends. T-1 motors
often do. Oil temp gauges such as the dipstick type
will indicate a failure in the oiling system. If
something goes wrong in the bottom end, it will show
on an oil temp gauge almost immediately. The headtemp
gauge will probably never show it until too late.
Likewise if a top end problem occurs, the CHT or EGT
gauge will show it instantly whereas the oil temp
gauge will only verify that you cooked your engine ten
miles ago!

Hope all this helps! -BaH
