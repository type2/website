Subject: RE: [T2] Question: Removing tail light cluster in 1977 VW Van

&gt; On this topic, a question for Ron at BD: why are the Hella
&gt; units so costly now? When I bought them 2 years ago I
&gt; paid much less.


Good question, but you'd have to ask Hella. (Not that they'd give you an
answer.) The wholesale cost from Hella has roughly doubled, and they're hard
to get even at that price. Maybe the situation will improve again, but it's
at least as likely that this signals a phase out of the product (leaving my
aftermarket ones, which are not as good but are of course much cheaper, as
the only alternative).
