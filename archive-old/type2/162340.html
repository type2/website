&gt; I hauled an extremely heavy load of lumber last month and I felt the
&gt; transmission slip a little while I was driving. This little slip turned
&gt; into a pretty annoying high rev between gears. Starting out was slow,
&gt; but once the gear caught everything was fine.
&gt;
&gt; that and decided it would not go backwards anymore. The friend didn't
&gt; like that and I refunded his down payment.
&gt;
&gt; Now, the van shifts perfectly between 1,2 and 3. However, it goes
&gt; forward in neutral and reverse. In park it idles fine, but jumps forward
&gt; when you rev it up.

sounds like it is the forward clutch seizing..could be the forward clutch
servo piston...

&gt; I took her to a transmission guy last week and he said that is needs
&gt; new clutch plates because a leakage caused the plates to bind.

????  I don't buy it but maybe he is right, after all he could drive and
hear it.
&gt;
&gt; I know nothing about this tranny. I don't know if those plates are in
&gt; the gearbox or the final drive. I also don't know if a mortal human can

it is in the gearbox

&gt; make this repair or if I must call upon the VW gods whom I most likely

you must be semi immortal to fix this tranny,  it is not impossible but
takes special tools and a very very clean work enviornement.

&gt; can't afford.

should be able to grab a vanagon auto tranny for about $200 or so.

good luck

also check your tranny fluid, does it smell burned?/  is there enough?
