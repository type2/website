Subject: Re: [T2] Disconnect Battery while running

And if the Voltage Regulator does not blow right away, the Diode Rectifier
Pack in the alternator that turns AC to DC will certainly become damaged or
totally burn out.  It's a very common occurrence when the battery cable
becomes disconnected on alternator charging systems, regardless if it's a
Cheby or VW.

&gt; &gt; The battery acts like a power conditioner. It buffers spikes and
&gt; &gt; brownouts to provide relatively clean power to the computer, stereo,
&gt; &gt; etc. The act of disconnecting and connecting the battery will also
&gt; &gt; cause power spikes. The ECU is too expensive to risk.
&gt; the battery is also part of the charging circuit and if disconected it
&gt; will blow the voltage regulator.
