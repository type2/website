Subject: 82 westy with excess Carbon Monoxide emissions

Hi Volks,

My Dad's Air-cooled 1982 California-spec Vanagon westy went for it's final
emissions check (after this it's old enough not to need another), and it
failed due to high Carbon Monoxide emissions. Here's the score:

HC ppm    Limit 136   Score 84
CO%                 1.28          1.62
NOppm               1784         952


Notice that the HC and NO are better than 30% below the limit, but the CO %
is almost 30% over the limit.  When the westy was tested 2 years ago it
passed with flying colours, so Dad was really surprised when it failed this
time around.

When we had the clutch replaced recently, Denmeister noticed that the O2
sensor was disconnected, so he hooked it back up. Dad seemed to think the
Bus got a bit more powerful (or perhaps just a bit less hesitant) since.
Could this have had an impact on the CO reading, or should we be looking at
something else. I don't think it's running rich, if it was then the HC would
be higher, wouldn't it?

Dad's pretty bummed out (Mom's term) about this, it's just the kind of
Birthday present you don't need, ya know?. I checked the archives and saw
that this problem has been seen before, but I didn't see a solution posted,
at least not one that matched these details.

Thanks for listening, Looking forward to your replies. Please cc your
responses to Dad at gpwdw_at_hotmail_dot_com if it's not too much trouble.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
