Subject: Re: [T2] Just installed new Westy canvas on a 78 and have a
  question

I got the bus depot canvas for my 78 and on careful measuring, found the
height of the canvas shorter than the stock- and for that reason,
fastened it to the bottom first, then stapled it along the top without
doing the fold over the plastic edge piece.  Actually much easier this
way, the staples are covered with trim from a fabric shop.  It is still
tight with the arms extended.

 &quot;He installed the new canvas from Bus Depot (looks nice) but on the
front,
 where the metal supports push forward at the &quot;elbow&quot; it rubs the canvas
and
 he is afraid it will rub thru.&quot;
