Subject: [T2] vw ny festivals?

Hey fellow valve adjusters,
    My 71 Westy and I are in Albany, NY. I've never been to a VW 
gathering....well other than zillions of buses in a Dead show parking lot) 
and would love to go. Where is the list of events and isn't there a gathering 
around Woodstock in Sept?

Ps Dennis from Phoenix, NY are you out here?
