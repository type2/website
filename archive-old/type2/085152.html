Subject: Re: [T2] Re-wiring

John
Why re-invent the wheel? The wires are much easier to run under the bus and 
you don't have to mess with anything to do with gas. Unless, of course you 
have one of those busses that has that undercarriage plate along the 
bottom...in that case, please disregard this msg :-)
