Subject: Clutch Size

Volks,

I just have a quick question that I couldn't seem to find a direct answer to 
in the archives. I took apart my clutch last night and am going to order a 
new pressure plate/assembly today. When determining the size of the assembly 
do I just mesure the diameter of the clutch plate where it fits inside the 
flywheel?? I mesured 210mm diamter across the clutch plate and 275mm (give 
or take) diameter across the flywheel. It makes sense to me but I just 
wanted to make sure before I order the parts.

Thanks,
