Subject: Re: [T2] Alternator belt

Not sure why.......
Every original allen headed adjusting bolt on a 72 to 79 bus has been 6mm. I
have never seen a triple-square there...
This is the one behind the oval plastic cover.



&gt; Bentley says I need a 12-pt driver to adjust the slack in the alternator
&gt; belt to 15mm of deflection.  I understand this is also called a serrated
&gt; wrench.
&gt;
&gt; What size 12-pt tool is this in mm?
