&gt; Actually water cools better because of the higher thermal transfer

&gt; additional internal energy degrees of freedom since it is trimolecular (H20)
&gt; vs bimolecular (N2).  The O-H vibrational modes are especially good at
&gt; energy transfer due to the very low mass of hydrogen.  Helium is also a very

Good to know :)
