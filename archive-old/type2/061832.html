Subject: Interior light

Merry Christmas Volks,
I'm new around here, but the first question I have is:  I tried putting in
a new interior light in my '68 from one taken from a '69
 everything looks the same but, seems like the '68 had a continous wire
going thru the bulb,(just one wire) and no ground wire.  Now the '69 light
has two prongs with connections, I hooked one end to &quot;hot&quot; and made another
wire for the other end and stuck it to the frame,
~ POW~  goes the 8amp fuse.  Thinking now&gt; tried it again and blew out the
new 8amp fuse again.  My question: How do you 
hook up the interior light on the ceiling, where do the wire (wires?)
connect?  
gone,
