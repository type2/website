Subject: Country Homes Camper?

I was first inclined to post for this reason alone:
QUOTE:  &quot;All it needs is a motor, other than that she runs
great.&quot;
(source:

0210723)
Say again?  Does it have legs?

But I found a way to keep my post legitimate... WHAT is a Country
Homes Camper?  I've never heard of the beast.  It sure looks
interesting,
though the &quot;detail&quot; pics don't enlarge.

Just wondering.  $800 is a good deal, even w/o a motor.  But
hey -
she runs great!
