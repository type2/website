Shelby,

The hinge change occurred in 1974.  They cut out the entire rear roof section 
and replaced the narrow cot with a real bed up above that sleeps two.  Prior 
to this, I think a westy was a modified sunroof bus.  

After a lot of years with a 71, the bed upgrade was one of the main reasons I 
&quot;upgraded&quot; to a 74.  Its a nice arrangement.
