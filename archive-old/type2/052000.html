Subject: [T2] Clever home made front bikerack spotted

Hi Volks,

I spotted a very clean, green late '70's Westy on the street this morning.
It had a clever homemade front bike rack that impressed me so much I
thought I'd describe it to you all.

It is attached to the top two bolts for the spare tire mount. The tire is
there too, but where the top two lugnuts should be there are two big fat
washers, and a big nut that somehow has a pipe threaded onto it. There's a
15&quot; or so pipe covered with black rubber hose and capped with a PCV elbow
that makes a neat bike hook. The tip of the PVC elbow is capped with a PVC
plug. There's a bike cable locked to one of the front tow loops under the
bumper. This reaches up to the bike mount and can be used to lock the
bike. I presume you would hold the bike on the rack with bungie cords.
Bike was not on it at the time.

The whole thing was very neat and clean. Apparently home made. Pretty
cool.

Drive safely,
