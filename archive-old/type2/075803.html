Subject: engine stand from Bus Depot!!  Rant

hello,

how ironic that this thread happens to be current at
the time of my &quot;experiences&quot; with this product.

i ordered the floor standing engine stand from bus
depot, picked up friday and tryed to assemble it this
morning. only to discover that that middle bracket
(observable in bill monk's pics) didnt match up. as
in, the holes do not line up!!!!!! what the !!??? this
is very disappointing. apparently bill's lined up, or
not, bill? 

am i missing something? input please. i seem to
remember someone on this list saying that they had
&quot;never been impressed by EMPI Products&quot; and i am now
beginning to see why!
 Have Fun (if possible)

Matty
