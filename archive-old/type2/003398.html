Subject: Air-Cooled 2 liter noise--throwout bearing?

Volks,
My 2 liter just started a new (scary sound) I started hearing a rattling
(loud) sound that goes along with engine RPMS.  Sort of sounds like someone
rattling a bolt or two in a coffee can.  This sound occurs in neutral or in
a gear...stopped or rolling.   Can feel vibration.....sort of a weird
feeling thru the clutch pedal when I press it in.  Other than the strange
vibration feeling, the pressure of the clutch pedal feels the same.

It is quite loud, amd the motor appears to behave normally..........I am
thinking something in the arena of the clutch.


Any ideas what this could be?  TIA





Noticed no difference in oil temperature, maybe slight increase in head
temps up hills.
