&gt; &gt;There's gotta be a better way to keep these wheels on the busses. 
&gt; &gt;I've heard story after story of wheels coming off VW's and had one do 
&gt; &gt;the same to me.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Is it the fact that they use lug bolts instead of studs and lugnuts? 
&gt; &gt;What are some recomendations for keeping the wheels on ....other than 
&gt; &gt;&quot;torque to the specs as per the bentley&quot;. We all know that. Sometimes 

well torque to spec, but one thing that does need to be done is to make
sure the wheel is seated fully, I have seen many that the wheel nut is not
fully down into the recess and it is hung up on a slight imperfection in
the wheel, so after a while the imperfection lets go and the lug nut gets
loose...

&gt; &gt;doesn't seem to work though. 4000 miles isn't that much.

no it isn't.... I wonder if the lug nuts comming off was the only
thing.  only time I had the experience the car made a horrible racket for
quite a while before we discovered the loose lug nuts.
