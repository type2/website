 &gt;Hi Everyone,
 &gt;Last Thursday, when I was driving &quot;Bess the Bus&quot;, a sound .....snip........
 &gt;The $2900 repair bill states that the shop
 &gt;replaced the heads but not the valve assemblies. Does that sound
 &gt;right? Maybe this is the problem.

.............&quot;Maybe...&quot;   And a dropped valve seat is very likely.  That is 
why the engine MIGHT need to come out....to see what the problem really is. 
Having an expensive mechanic pulling the engine _assumes_ you have had an 
expert on type 4 engines look over the engine as it is running in the 
vehicle, and that you and the expert have rationally eliminate OTHER 
possible causes that are NOT inside the engine.

 &gt;I have about $450 dollars to start fixing Bess and pull the engine.

...........Again, it sounds like you are assuming the engine has to come 
out, before you really have looked at everything else.

 &gt;Can anyone guess if that will be enough money? I would hate to pull the 
engine
 &gt;and discover I am going to need more money then I have, I would rather
 &gt;leave her in the garage until I raise the funds.

.............Right, and I am _guessing_ that $450 US dollars is only about 
enough to have someone else (working at $50 an hour) pull the engine and 
tear it apart and diagnose the problem, if indeed it is INSIDE the engine. 
But remember, we are ASSUMING it is a problem inside the engine.  It might 
not be.

.....................Once out of the chassis, Having a highly paid mechanic 
fix the (currently unknown) problem and getting the engine back together 
and back in the chassis will probably cost ANOTHER $450, and possibly two 
or three times that much. Nobody knows yet. But the guy is getting $50 an 
hour. And you already have evidence that it cost $2,900 the last time.

....................Before pulling that engine, please try to eliminate the 
several OTHER possible causes of the noise, such as a loose object being in 
contact with the spinning fan assembly, or the rotating alternator....or 
some other rotating engine part.....(something like a piece of cardboard 
hitting the spokes of a kid's bicycle wheel).   You don't want to spend 
your very limited funds getting the engine out if the noise is due to a 
frayed alternator belt or some other fairly simple explanation.

................the fact that your engine runs fine demands that all the 
possible external causes be considered and eliminated before deciding to 
pull the engine and tear it down. From reading your post, I don't get the 
impression you are certain that you have eliminated those possible external 
causes of the noise. Other listers will have ideas about those other 
possible explanations. And _then_ you may end up with having to pull the 
engine anyhow, eventually.

Your budget sounds like you are going to have to become an expert on fixing 
and overhauling your own engine, or you are going to have to park the bus 
and save lots of money to have someone else take care of it for you.

 &gt;Other notes that might help.
 &gt;78 2.0 manual transmission
 &gt;no smoke when the noise started, no apparent loss of power, but I drive it
 &gt;like a baby.
 &gt;there was plenty of oil in it when I got home
 &gt;no red/green or other lights went on when the noise started.
 &gt;Bess made the noise all the way home unless I was at midrange RPM's
 &gt;Thanks very much in advance,
 &gt;Don Manzano
