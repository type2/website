Subject: RE:Welding your VW

I agree with George Lyle, 100%. Go take a course you never regret it.  I
get way to much rework from people trying to use a stick welder to do the
thin stuff. I'm 41 and have been welding since i was 11 soi  been doing this
almost 31 years (come July).  I have 4 wire welders, 3 110v and 1 220 v and
1 Craftsman stick welder ac/dc reverse polarity. In the last 15 years i have
never tried to weld anything under 12 gauge with a stick. Just recently i
had to blow the dust outta  mine to weld up a back hoe bucket. IF it wasn't
handed down to me from my dad i'd probably sell it.,,later
