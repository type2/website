Subject: Re: [T2] rear axle fell off (!)

My half shaft had loosened bolts when I inspected them the first time too.

May just be the nature of the beast.

Your CV joint may be fine and require a simple reinstall.

Lock-tite anyone?


&gt;The Right Rear axle was completely free of the rear wheel, bolts and all.
&gt;The bolts all looked ok... as if it had just been removed from the
&gt;wheel......as did the threads they go into..
&gt;
&gt;The boom was the joint breaking(for lack of a better word) free and the
&gt;banging was the free axle whacking the torsion arm (as well as everything
&gt;in reach i would imagine)
