&gt;does anyone know how to decipher vin #s?  her is what is on my tag:
&gt; p4r177d51227246734

I have NO idea what all the letters and numbers are in front of the real vin
#.  The real vin # is 2272466734. This number should be on a aluminum plate
riveted to the left front corner of the dash and stamped in the body in the
left rear corner of the engine compartment.
The first 2 tells you it is a type2.
The second 2 tells you it is a station wagon.
The 7 tells you it is a 77!!  NOT a 76.
The next 2 tells you it is a 70's bus, otherwise 227 also means 67.
The last six numbers are the serial number.

&gt;  and it also has 4757209ub221861 on the tag behind the
&gt; driver seat.

No idea what these numbers are...not VW numbers.

&gt; the engine has this on it: gd009167.

GD means it is a 76-77 2.0L with solid lifters. This is the correct engine.
But did you read this number off the left side of the fan housing? If yes,
it may or may not be the real engine number. Fan housings get swapped
around. The real number will be stamped in the case between the fan housing
and the square crankcase vent.
