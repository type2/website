Here it's Friday and I havn't been up on the soap box at all yet today so I
guess it's my turn to take a whack at this rapidly developing FART. Anyway,
I have ordered from Bus Depot (BD) on several occasions. They have been
helpful at times, and exasperating at others. Do they answer their e-mail?
Couldn't prove it by me. Does it sound like I've had some problems with BD
in the past? All minor problems that weren't worth mentioning. Even now
they aren't really worth mentioning except to make a point. Does anybody
our there in list land feel that Ron and his guys aren't trying to do the
right thing? I get the feeling that they are doing the right thing for all
us list members and all their other customers as well.

I've never talked to Ron personally, when I order I use the web site and
only had to call once about a core deposit that was MIA. I originally
wanted to apply the core deposit on a flywheel towards another order that I
was putting together and take advantage of the 10% bonus for doing that. I
talked to Dan and he told me he would call AVP to see if the core was
accounted for and rebuildable. I didn't hear back from Dan but a few days
later I got a check in the mail for the $75.00 core charge. So I lost out
on $7.50 worth of parts, boo hoo. Woe is me! If thats all I ever lost out
on I'd be a very happy man. 

I guess the point is that BD is trying to make people happy and stay in
business. That's not easy for anyone these days. BD also, in my opinion,
tries very hard to provide outstanding customer service. If you think you
got shafted, let him know. Give him the benefit of the doubt. Maybe
somebody had a bad day, somebody dropped the ball, it slipped through the
cracks, or something beyond his control happened. If you don't get
satisfaction, THEN tell us (the List).

Everyone has the right to decide who they want to do business with. If you
can't see your way clear to deal with BD use someone else. We're all adults
here, let's try to be objective about it. Some people are never happy,
others are never upset. That's life! Lets try to find some middle ground.
In the immortal words of Rodney King... &quot;Can't we all just get along&quot;. Well
I guess I'll go put the soap box up for now. Just my $.02
