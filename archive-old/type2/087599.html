Subject: won't idle. again.

I have a feeling this subject is only slightly less annoying than choice of
oils.   But I'm desperate.

The engine is a 1600DP that I bought sight unseen from a non list member.
Out of the crate, it ran but would not idle. It's now on my test stand.

After discovering that one spark plug hole was stripped, I bought new heads
and stole top-end parts from a running engine in the garage and installed
these on the DP.  So heads, carb, distributor, coil, oil pump, and DP
manifold are all either new or known to work on another engine.
Essentially, all but the case and its contents are known quantities.
Compression is 110 all around.

It won't idle. No amount of tweaking the 34PICT-3 will help.  Very little
change in rpm as the bypass and mixture screws are turned.

I've ordered a fuel pressure gauge so I can check pump pressure.


So ............ A classic symptom of a vacuum leak, eh?  But no amount of
squirting various fluids such as WD-40 all over the carb and manifold have
deteced one.

I have access to a small vacuum pump from work. I plan to block off the
carb port and pump on the manifold with the valves closed in a last attempt
to look for a leak.

Can anyone suggest an idle-killer that I've not checked?

Thanks, Jack
