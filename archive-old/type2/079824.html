Subject: 68 to 71 tail light MADNESS, need help

The situation is that everything works normally - rear parking 
lights, turn signals, e-flashers and brake lights. The problem is the 
left front turn signal operates as a brake light when the pedal is 
pushed. Otherwise this light fixture works normally for all other 
functions as does the right front.

At the advice of a list member I double checked the ground to the 
left rear tail light and it was good. Just to triple check I tested 
everything with the ground to the left rear disconnected and 
everything mysteriously still worked. I then removed the ground from 
the right rear and everything on bother worked just fine. The front 
left is still acting as a brake light.

What gives?

Have the rear tail lights found a path to ground through the front 
left turn signal circuit? The left and right housing have no common 
connections in the engine room. Perhaps at the flasher relay which is 
tied into the brake wiring circuit.......

Are left and right tail light housings the same or mirror images of 
each other? The Bentley makes it look like mirror images. The ones in 
the bus are not. Looking from the rear of the bus or from above the 
ground tab is on the left. Is this correct?

If the ground is not hooked up should the tail lights work at all. ?

Finally, the heavier or thicker filament is for the brakes and 
flashers , right , and the parking lights are the thinner and 
subsequently less bright?


Thanks
Chris
