&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; Assuming your distributor is constructed the same as those for VW flat 4s
I have dealt with...
&gt;
&gt; At the bottom of the distributor there is a ring with teeth offset to one
side that mesh with the gear inside of the crank case. They should be offset
in the same direction as the rotor arm points.
&gt; The ring is held on by a split pin that goes right through the shaft - so
if the pin were removed the ring could be rotated 180 degrees and the pin
replaced. thus rotating the distributor 180 degrees.
&gt; You would have two self canceling errors and the vacuum canister could be
aligned to a position were it does not foul anything.
&gt;
&gt; I must emphasize that I have not done this,  so do not know of any
problems with the setup; any insights from others welcome.
&gt;
&gt; Good luck

I have just been informed that the 050 is not vacuum advance ( I have not
seen it yet) So that problem is solved..
Just down to one question now....

Thanks for replying...

Peace Brother,
Snoopy
