Hmmm, sounds like Safelite windshields aren't shaped quite right!  This
description sounds like the first and last time I will ever install a
Mexican muffler on a VW.  I'd pay a lot more for a part that actually fit
right!

How about other aftermarket windsheld manufacturers?  Any experiences,
folks?
