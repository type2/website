Subject: Bus Depot Again

Hey -
Ron and the Bus Depot totally ROCKS. There is no other way to describe the
fact that he provides what so many of us need. For those of you who choose
to criticize at the drop of a hat, think again. Would you rather drive to
U-Pull-It or the VW dealership or make that fruitless call to someone who
claims to have what you need but never does? Anyone who cliams the service
is bad is the same as someone who sends their Big Mac back because there
aren't enough pickles. This is a valuable service - not Burger King - and
it could go away.  Wise the f*ck up. We have a good thing here...
