Subject: runs rough when cold, won't start when warm

Hey folks! I have an 80 air cooled vanagon. When I first start it up it
runs rough. It will only run about 1 or 2 mintues ad then it dies. It
cranks and won't start again. If it sits a couple hours it starts again,
but only runs a few minutes. I changed the fuel filter- no help. I'm
kinda a novice, but can you give me some places to look. I figure the
fuel pump is my next stop. Thanks for the help.
Mike
