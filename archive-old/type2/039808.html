They pretty much do. I exchanged a timing light yesterday. The guy asked
for a receipt -- huh? It was a gift, and I said so. So he pointed me at
the timing lights and told me to get one. Not real helpful, but at least
he didn't give me the &quot;are you sure you hooked it up right?&quot; line I was
expecting. He lives to see another day.... ;-)

&gt; Electric tools might not work that way, but &quot;hand&quot;
&gt; tools do.
