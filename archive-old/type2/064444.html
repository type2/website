I've heard from a couple of sources that overtorquing this bolt can also
seriously damage the camshaft assembly. The bolt onto which the sump plate 
fastens is attached to the case in close proximatey to the centre camshaft 
bearing housing.  Overtorquing this bolt can distort the centre camshaft 
bearing housing, damaging the bearing and camshaft. Nine foot pounds is the 
spec re Bentley.
