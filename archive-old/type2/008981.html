&gt; Type IV -- Variant

I have seen some literature that pictures T II/T1 (spilt-screen bus) with a
T III(1500) Squareback on the same spec chart and in that case the
squareback  is listed as a &quot;Variant.&quot; I've got the book in the bus somewhere
but you can prolly find on www.vintagebus_dot_cam.  Perhaps &quot;variant&quot; has a
generic translation from German that goes some like &quot;little station wagon&quot;
:) 

The Bentley refers to the 72 and up bus engine as the &quot;dual carb&quot; engine
which is also casually refered to by the masses as the type IV engine
because of its introduction in the TypeIV(411/412) ar the pancake because of
its flat stature.

I was always curious about what the difference between the Type IV 411 and
412 was. If you know p-mail.
