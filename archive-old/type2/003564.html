&gt;GTI, Scirocco) were excellent.  However, the Vanagon manual is covering
&gt;air cooled, diesel, and the water boxer motors - perhaps they just
&gt;couldn't allot enough space.  I regret paying the big bucks for that


John is right but he misses a bit of it, although the early A1 manuals are
great too, frankly no Bentley manual published for VW cars after about '84
or so is worth anything compared to the older.  Once they dumped the old
step by step text format with the spec sections at the ends, and went to the
all picture cause we're printing it right off the new dealer service fiche
format(CD now I guess) it all went to hell.  About that time they probably
started thinking the average American dealer service tech needed pictures
only (mostly true from mid 80's on as well around me)  What you end up with
are frustrating useless manuals that you are constantly scouring every
picture for an obscure assembly note or torque value or whatever, no clear
procedures.  Now some of it is better, some of the flowcharting is nice if
complex and there is a pile of info in those books, but it is hard as hell
to get to, I mean they don't even have what I call a useable index, even if
some of it doesn't appear in any other text.  A good illustration is that I
use an early Rabbit Bentley to tear down a Vanagon auto tranny, the Rabbit
book is step by step, look at the auto section in the Vanagon book some day
if you dare.  Still hands down particularly for the air cooled Vanagon, buy
the Haynes, incredible book even if you do have to sort out the odd Euro
1600 stuff.  As long as you don't have specific interior questions, camper
questions, auto tranny, etc, you'll be OK for near all run of the mill
mechanical procedures, save the $60 and borrow a Bentley if you really need
it for something.  The bus Haynes is good but a bit more vague as too much
of the 2.0 liter engine stuff is randomly mixed here and there.  Like he
also says the Vanagon Bentley covers a lot of ground, but hell it gets
worse, my Quantum manual covers like 5 transmissions, as many powerplants,
4wd, and on and on.  And actually Bentley has at least partially returned to
the old style, the last we bought, the early Passat book, was much more text
based like manuals of old.  Now if they would only start rewriting the
Vanagon book.
