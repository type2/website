Subject: Re: [T2] Tell me what you think of this bus....

Rob,

I wouldn't touch it if I were you. It sounds like they have no clear paperwork
(or at least not a title). And it doesn't sound like it's worth $500.00 (unless
both the tranny/motor really ARE in decent shape).

If you're close I would go have a look at it and see what's what. And you could
prolly negioate not to take it if it doesn't drive well.

my $0.02

Harry

*&gt; Hey, I'm thinking of buying this bus on ebay.  It
*&gt; looks kind of shady though.  I was wondering if anyone
*&gt; with knowledge of buses could take a look at it and
*&gt; let me know what they think:
