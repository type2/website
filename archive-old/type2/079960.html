Subject: Re: [T2] missing, solution!

John,

I don't know what the interaction may have been, only, like lots of other
stuff on the list, what the solution &quot;seemed&quot; to be.

We put the new plugs in and that was the end of the problem...my Dad drove
the truck with the new plugs in it for probably another 25,000 miles
before he traded it in on a new one....never did have the problem again.

as always&lt;grin&gt; you mileage may vary, dave

&gt; &gt;It's just what the counterman told me....Turns out, that was the only
&gt; &gt;thing my Dad had done to his car in months and started having a problem
&gt; &gt;right after he did it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;In the three weeks before we fixed it, we did *every* check I could
&gt; &gt;imagine on his engine and ignition system.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&lt;grin&gt; you are quite welcome to try it on *your* plugs&lt;grin&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I don't want to dispute but frankly I've used WD40 on several occasions
&gt; as a water displacement device to hose down entire ignition systems
&gt; including the plugs.  My old '85 had an annoying habit in this sort of
&gt; weather with salt spray on the roads of beginning to miss horribly, the
&gt; WD-40 was always a sure cure if I was in the middle of nowhere, and I
&gt; know I didn't change those plugs in the 40k or so it was in my posession.
&gt; The real cure was to take the plugs, cap, wires, coil scrub em all down
&gt; in distilled water every so often and dry em in the oven, but that was a bit
&gt; hard to do in the parking lot on the average 20 degree day after work.  This
&gt; is in fact I believe a sort of standard use for WD-40, used to even proclaim
&gt; it as such on the can.  Never got why it happened on the '85, didn't on the
&gt; '86, '87, or '90 maybe the 1.9 engine was prone to contrariness or maybe
&gt; the ignition system was weak, never did figure it out.
&gt; 
&gt; Just saying.  Still your results sort of speak to it mattering, perhaps it
&gt; depends on how hot the plugs get, etc.  I can't imagine oil and kerosene
&gt; being conductive on the ceramic but who knows.
