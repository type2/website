Subject: &quot;Hooverizing&quot;  my new jugs

Today I started work prepping my 94 mm jug set per the Bob Hoover &quot;sermon&quot;
about the value of such measures adding perhaps a year to the life of the
pistons.

I was unable to locate any Bon Ami cleanser ... I experimented with TSP
(TriSodium Phosphate) briefly, but it started to discolor the surface of the
jugs ... indicating that it was oxidizing the metal ...so I rinsed it off.

Then I got a bar of soap from the bathroom and a scotchbright sponge and
this worked beautifully to remove the small amount of oxidation and to
restore a bright clean surface. So, I guess it's going to be scotchbright
and soap for the rest of the cylinders too.

After scrubbing, I sprayed down the cylinder with WD40 and put the cylinder
in the oven at 250 degrees (F) for a half hour to drive off any remaining
moisture.

Then I carefully masked off the machined areas and sprayed down the fins
with carb cleaner and mineral spirits and painted the fins lightly with 50%
Rustoleum Flat Black mixed with mineral spirits.

Right now, it's a bit damp and cold outside so I removed the masking tape
and baked the painted cylinder at 120 degrees for  a half hour.

I figure, at this rate, I'll have the whole set completed by Monday :-)
