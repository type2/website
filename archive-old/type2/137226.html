Subject: Re: [T2] Propane fuel conversion on 1977?

So how come when I turn my propane bbq on, I get gas out of it, and not a
liquid? Why is this heating necessary? I'm just wondering how it would be
different in a vehicle? We use a LOT of propane powered vehicles up here in
B.C., and for quite awhile, you could buy the new Russian Lada jeeps and
cars up here with the dual fuel as a factory option. 

Regards,

Courtney

Look here for info: http://www.impco.ws/

 

The problem is you need to convert the propane fuel from a liquid (it is a
liquid in the tank) to a gas (LPG carbs are gas/gas). In a watercooled
system, this is accomnplished by heat exchanging with the coolant. Not
possible in an aircooled system. However, one could just as easily use the
air-cooled coolants (the air or better, the oil). One just cannot buy a
ready made heat exchanger like this, thus this needs to be engineered. Not
that big a deal, really.

 

I plan to do a LPG conversion at some point. I am probably dreaming, but I
see a future where I pay Jake Raby to rebuild my engine specifically for LPG
(higher compression that gas is optimal for LPG) and I use the Megasquirt
system for either liquid LPG injection, or a LPG carb, and really work this
out properly. To me, the biggest challenge is obtaining a good fuel tank.
Optimally, one that will fit where the existing one is and will also hold a
reasonable quantity.

 

Bogged down right now with rust repair/painting/interior resto.
