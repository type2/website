Subject: Fwd: Crooked rear wheel?

Did anybody get this? I'm going to be under there this weekend and
want to know what I can look for... It's only one wheel affected. :(

The driver's side rear wheel is crooked... Like if the rear end was
jacked up, the top is tipped out. But it's not jacked up.

The passenger side ISN'T crooked. There's nothing obviously wrong that
I could see other than some torn CV boots (joint and boot replacement
is scheduled for a few weeks from now along with new shocks).

What exactly should I be looking for? Could it just be a screwy adjustment?
