Subject: electric die grinder

Thanks to all who responded to my electric die grinder post. I have found a 
few possibilities for a decent die grinder to grind down the miles of weld 
beads and spot welds on my '73 bus.  They are not as cheap as I would have 
thought compared to the air powered alternative.  Here is what I found.

Chicago Electric 4.5 amps - $50 at Harbor Frieght
Dewalt                  3.0 amps - $150
Milwaukee            4.5 amps -$230

The Harbor Frieght grinder  seems awfully tempting, and sounds so American.  
I called them for more info and they would only tell me, it was made 
&quot;overseas&quot;, but would not tell me exactly where, so in spite of it's name, 
it is about as American as chairman Mao's little red book.  I am not above 
buying cheap tools made overseas, but I usually reserve these purchases for 
throwaways, like my Campbell Hausfeld air chisel , made in Taiwan a whopping 
$15 (which is still going, by the way).  Call me cheap, but $50 is starting 
to be a lot of $$ for a potential throw-away.   The USA alternatives are all 
available locally.

So my questions:  Is the quality of Dewalt, Miwaukee etc. significantly 
better?  Is a 3 amp grinder sufficient for grinding hard-to -reach spotwelds 
or do I need the 4.5 model?  Is the more powerful model worth the price 
difference?  I am looking for a long term alternative to an air powered die 
grinder.  I don't have the space for a compressor large enough to power air 
tools efficiently.  I am looking for good value and durability.  I know it's 
nit-picky for a one item purchase, but I try to select tools carefully and 
keep them for a long time.  Feel free to e-mail me off line if you feel I am 
straying too far from bus content.  Any help is always appreciated.  - 
James.
