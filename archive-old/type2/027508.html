Again, my '78 got caught in a parking lot, and would not kick over when I 
turned the ignition key on.

I had this problem last year, now I have it again.

I do have a Ford solenoid switch at my starter solenoid, so I was really 
surprised to see this 'hot start' problem today, in 35 degree weather (USA).

My theory is that my wires are corroded, and when I hit the solenoid, I am 
actually jostling the wires just enough to get back the extra amps of 
current to get the starter solenoid to react.

The problem is in the corroded wire(s) and connections, not the starter 
solenoid.

(And the world is not really round, but it is made up of many, many flat 
spaces, like my back yard and yours...)

(And if you go far enough and fast enough, you will actually fall off the 
edge, but you will find another flat space just before you go careening off 
into space...)

(And I wonder why it is that no one visits me??  )
