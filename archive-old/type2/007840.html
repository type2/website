A listee wrote about a t2 motor that dropped all its oil.  

Last time I had a major service on my a/c vanagon, the mechanic noticed oil
weeping round the edges of a push-in plug in the block, that opens in to
the oil gallery.  (I understand this is like the welch-plug in a
watercooled motor, that is where the casting was poured).

Anyway, he removed the plug, which he said was about 1/2&quot; diameter, cut
threads in the hole and screwed in a replacement threaded plug.  He does
this as a matter of course when re-building engines, as sudden loss of the
plug under pressure when the motor is running results in all your oil being
pumped out in seconds.

Hope this helps someone.
