Subject: Torque settings

can someone list a full set of torque settings??  Ft/lbs

I lost the one I made up, and I can't find either Bentley and my Haynes says 
the rocker studs are torqued at 10 ft/lbs - 11 mm nuts-  which I question as 
being too light a setting.  this is the nuts on the studs of the rocker arms 
that I am asking about...

But can someone post these settings on the type 2 library, like under the 
setting TORQUE so we can print them out...
