Subject: RE: [T2] More Merc Wheel Info

Hi All,

I went looking for the right Mercedes wheels for my bus but gave up in the
end,  I ended up getting some custom wheels made instead, although I can't
remeber offsets etc I could possibly track them down but suffice to say I
was running 235/75/15's on the rear and 205/75/15's on the front with no
clearance problems.  The Bus was setup for offroad work and these tires
along with the V8 transplant were awesome.  I've since switched to
205/65/15's allround as I run the Bus on the road a lot more now and it's
easier to carry a spare (ever seen how big a 235/75/15 is compared to
standard)

My guards weren't cut, I still had full suspension travel and steering lock
with no problem and for the two years I ran these tires in extreme
conditions no noticable bearing wear etc etc although because of the
extreeme conditions, 2 1/2ft of water, Mud sand etc I did pay carefull
attention to bearings and CVs.  Anyway just wanted to add that it might be a
better proposition to get some wheels made.  Mine cost $110AUD (Australian)
each which was cheaper than any off the rack wheel I could get.  You can go
to eithier of my sites below to see them.

Cheers
Steve
