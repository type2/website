we are having a top quality setup custom made, and they should be done
within 2 weeks time. No more of this erroneous or &quot;not working at all&quot;
units.

&gt; I have bought two fuel/air gauges from CB Performance. First the more
&gt; expensive 3wire which would not work and then the cheaper one wire that
&gt; won't work either. I followed the instructions to the letter. The only
&gt; difference is that I &quot;C&quot; clamped the sensor to a vice grip which I
inserted
&gt; in my tail pipe. I drove 20min on the freeway today and the meter did one
&gt; swing to 12 then went back to rest on 17 and stayed there. I have a good
&gt; ground
&gt; wire and I've tested the meter for power.
&gt;
&gt; Soooo...does anyone have an idea where I can get a good fuel/air meter?
&gt; Or maybe some idea as to what I might be doing wrong.
