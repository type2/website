Subject: Re: [T2] 79 Transporter FI having trouble starting and idling -
  need  help

From: Chris 
&gt; I recently rebuilt the top end of my 79 2000cc FI (California) engine.
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; The dwell is set at 42 degrees and the timing is at 7.5 BTDC.  
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

I am puzzled..... you have a 79 Calif engine WITH points and timing set at 7.5 before and NO O2 sensor??

Are you sure you have a 79 Calif bus/engine?
Sounds like you do not. Sounds like a 78 engine or a mis-matched mumbo jumbo of parts.

79 Calif has electronic ignition with a dual vacuum unit that times at 5 after.
