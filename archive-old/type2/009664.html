John, other listees

I am converting a panel van (93 model Eurovan) at the moment, into a camper. I also
have a Bay Window Camper which started life as a Devon Caravette and has been
retrimmed, the furniture rearranged, etc. so I feel I've almost converted that -
but without the hassles of the roof and windows. I'm doin my own camper now for a
few reasons: a) I reckon I can do it, b) I want it done my way, with a different/
original layout and equipment, c) Because it's fun and I like doing that kind of
thing.

Its a different question if you're doing an old van, especially if you're considering
fitting an elevating roof as well. My new van isn't getting one but if it was, I'd
have it fitted for me (its not that expensive, compared to the price of the roof!!!)
I am planning on spending in the region of £10,000 all done, obviously you'd not spend
that on a Bay Window (unless you were making it really nice). When you say &quot;converting
into a Westy&quot; do you mean into a camper, or into an actual Westfalia with all the
fittings, trimming, etc. that they have in particular?

I've done a lot of searching around for DIY conversion bits, there are UK companies
who supply the leading brands of major equipment, plus their own lines of the odds and
sods. A lot of the stuff I'm getting is Scandanavian and German though (through a UK
distributor). If you want specific details pmail me and I can give you a list.

As for &quot;how to do it&quot; I don't actually possess a single book on this! I've read many
articles from MMM (Motorcaravan Motorhome Monthly), which has an avid DIY section,
but I've found better ways of doing most things, ie. 2nd battery wiring, trimming,
etc. I just seem to have sat down and worked out how to do everything - this is where
the other camper helped.

If its a home conversion and you need specific help, ask away cos I've probably crossed
the bridge you're traversing!

RE:	To convert or not to convert...
[...]
I have a '79 7 pass. and am interested in converting it into a Westy.
Actually, I am not as interested in the conversion process as I am in the
end result. Would I be better off just saving my nickels and dimes and
buying a Westy or would there be some value in converting it myself? The
main reason that I would want to convert it myself is the whole &quot;parable of
the boiled frog&quot; thing. It is easier to push smaller purchases past the
committee (my wife) until I finally have a Westy than to spring the whole
thing on her at once.
If I were to do it myself, where could I find the necessary information (web
sites, books, people that have already done it, etc)?

I have browsed through the archives for related posts but was unable to find
any. If there are some then just let me know where to find them.
