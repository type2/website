Subject: RE: [T2] pop-up tent replacement

Ron's instructions for how to put poptop canvas on a bus was exactly 
right. I write not to add to his comments, but to emphasize one of them. 

This is the most tedious task you'll ever do on your bus. Flat sanding 
body panels to prep for paint comes close. But this is the dull one. Set 
aside more time than you can imagine. There are three trillion screws to 
put it, some of them in tight spaces, and getting the fit correct does 
require the trial and error that Ron talks about. Plus, it will 
inevitably be the hottest day of the year.
