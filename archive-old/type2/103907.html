Subject: Re: [T2] Overhead net

&lt;snip&gt;Which reminds me, the 68 and 69 overhead net in
the BACK of the bus
(FIF)
&gt;was so cool. The idead of putting the headbanger in
was just stupid.
&gt;It's a lot easier to mount speakers in the
&quot;headbanger&quot; than in a cargo
net.&lt;snip&gt;

While both are true, the PO of my 68 Westy had a neat
idea of mounting speakers in the back without the
&quot;headbanger&quot;.   It took a little bit of extra
woodworking, but the pay off was great.  The speakers
were mounted at an angle on either side of the roof
area just in front of the net and above the closet. 
When the weather gets warmer I will post pics on my
website of the setup for those interested.  P-mail me
if you are.
Besides I personally prefer the net setup myself as I
have whacked myself plenty of times in my former 70
Westy and my current 71 Westy.
