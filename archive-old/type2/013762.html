&gt;&gt; Bahh. Suck it in. This is your golden excuse to go buy a compressor and
&gt;&gt; impact wrench. C'mon, you KNOW you want to... EVERYBODY's getting one.
&gt;&gt; They're COOL...   ;-P

&gt; You betcha!  You can pick up a used compressor for $100 or less if you 
&gt; look around and the house brand tools sold by Lowes (Devilbiss) are 
&gt; cheap and of good quality.
&gt;
&gt; My favorite compressor tools are:
&gt;
&gt; Vacuum box (for evacuating A/C systems before charging) $7
&gt; Impact wrench (sounds cool) $46
&gt; Air hose (for tires) $12
&gt; Blow gun (for cleaning just about everything including the garage 
&gt; floor) $5
&gt; Cutoff tool (cuts through just about anything and makes showers of 
&gt; sparks!) $25

(!) Compared to a slugging wrench, this is one helluva lot of stuff to 
carry around under the Z-bed, sez I.
