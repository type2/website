No I haven't noticed this.  I'm just as likely to be ignored by an air 
cooled driver as a water cooled driver.  Since I do drive one of those 
&quot;front engine Volks&quot; I guess I get tired of hearing this.

So take your &quot;new&quot; Chevy out and see how many other Chevy drivers wave... 
None?  Not surprising.

Now take you old &quot;classic&quot; Chevy out and see how many other &quot;classic&quot; 
Chevy drivers wave...  More huh?

Its another way of seeing the enthusiasts vs. &quot;average&quot; driver issue.  
More old VW drivers drive them because they are &quot;special&quot;.  More new VW 
drivers drive them because it is a nice automobile.  Back in 1974 would 
you expect every beetle driver to wave to you?  I wouldn't.  Beetles were 
&quot;just&quot; cars to many people back then.  Now the &quot;just&quot; car drivers are 
more likely to be in a Toyota or a Golf III or a Neon.

It doesn't make water cooled vw drivers any more or less or their cars as 
any more or less than an air cooled driver.

In case folks don't know  (most probably fdon't remember or care) I drive 
a '93 Eurovan almost daily and am slowly trying to revive at least some 
of my three '73 Things...  I've been into VWs for almost my entire life.

&gt; &gt;Yes, VWoA is lame but lets not compare VW's to the Saturn. Apples to
&gt; &gt;Oranges.
&gt; Has anynoe noticed how hard it is to catch the eye of a front engine Volks 
&gt; driver. All Aircooleds wave. Many other car brand names take at least a look.
&gt; But most front engine Volks avert their eyes like they are embarassed to 
&gt; be seen near one of those old noisy monstrosities, in case someone notices
&gt; it was made by the same company that made their car. I notice this especially
&gt; at stop lights. They sort of shrink down, hoping no one will make the
&gt; connection before the light changes. Of course this doesn't apply to teh old 
&gt; rusty front engines with a group of kids in it who invariably follow you 
&gt; hooting, and honking the horn asking if your van is for sale?
