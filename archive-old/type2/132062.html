Subject: Re: [T2] Tips on getting ball joints done - 1973

&gt; Cost?
&gt; Swing lever shaft: $100 installed

Get him to do that if he sticks to him quote even though the job is easier
than a split window.

&gt; Tie rod ends: $250 installed

This is unreasonable even for quality repair work. Buy the $40 tie-rod tool
and DIY. It's a 15 minutes job with the tool. Measure carefully and you
won't have any change in wheel toe.

pm me for details on where to buy the tool.

&gt; Ball Joints: $470 installed

Buy this from Bus Boys instead:

I.  211-498-101BX  Front Torsion Arm, Rebuilt With New German Ball Joints -
Set of 4 Bus/Pickup 1970 to 1979  $174.95
