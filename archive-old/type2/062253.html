Subject: Towing split window bus w/'82 Vanagon

I once bought a vehicle in Denver (a 181/Thing) and considered doing a
marathon &quot;roadwarrior&quot; weekend to drive from Phoenix and back in order to
drag it home. Ultimately, I found that it was cheaper and **safer** to hire
an 18 wheeler transport to drag it on its trailer. Seriously, you might wish
to at least investigate this option. Denver to Phoenix cost me $300. The
rental on the vehicle ($75.00 per day) plus gas ($whatever) and food
($whatever) and possible lodging ($whatever) or sleeping in the vehicle
($whatever) plus possible break downs($whateverX?) or accidents
($whateverX?) plus wear and tear on my aging body ($whateverX?) made the
$300.00 a true bargain. I got to spend the time saved making the money to
pay for the transporter plus got a good two nights sleep and time spent with
my family. I was rested and ready for work the following Monday.
Investment in your own health and saftey is a wise investment...
Just my $.02
