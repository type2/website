Subject: Re: [T2] Painting a Bus

thats cool to but i am takeing off like 40 lbs of spray paint right now..though..... not that it doesnt look good but i really need a laquer there...
i am planning on painting it with a spray gun ........going to use gloss and such also..
want it to look like it just rolled off the show room floor like that......
if you see the link on fullmoonbusclub .. i painted her red and she looked great people thought that she had been pained at a garage...
i just thought she needed a real paint job... the spray paint isnt doing her metal any good,,...
she is beeing tottaly restored...
peace

&gt;&gt;for all those that paint how do you paint a bus Tye Dye....
&gt;
&gt;I saw one bus that was tye dyed and it looked great, the owner said he just 
&gt;used spray cans from Wally World.
&gt;
&gt;I was thinking though that you could use a sponge for a tyedye effect.
