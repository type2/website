Subject: Re: Reattaching oil pickup in a 1600cc engine

You can do it but it's hard. Screw the stud back into
the case and through the bracket on the pick-up. Start
the self-locking nut, with washer, on the top of the
stud. This part is hard but it can be done. Then bend
a wrench to reach up into the case and around the
bracket to tighten the nut. It's hard to make this
wrench. It has to be bent in several places and curved
around to reach behind the bracket. I've had one of
these in my tool box for years. It's seldom used but I
don't know how you could tighten the nut without it.
Oh yeah, don't forget to fish the old nut and washer
out of the case. It might cause nasty things to happen
if it got in the wrong place while the engine was
running.

&gt;Last time I changed oil (1600cc engine) the longer
&gt;stud that holds the oil pickup down came out and left
&gt;the oil pickup loose. I would like to reattach it
&gt;before any serious damage is done. Anyone have any
&gt;tips?

&gt;Thanks,
