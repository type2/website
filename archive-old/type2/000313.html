Do you have a wire from the harness hooked up to temp sensor II, the
cylinder head temp sender next to front (front being front) of the intake on
cylinder number 3? The connector which comes from the harness should have a
clearish plastic sleave over a male spade lug close to the area where the
double relay would be mounted. It should be connected to pin 13 of the ECU
though. Maybe someone moved the pin if they replaced the end, or miscount?
This would explain a lot...

The only other 'free' wire might be the one that goes to pin 1 of the
ignition coil, but it should go to pin 1 of the ECU harness as well. This
wire gets trigger information from the coil/distributor to fire the
injectors. Solid Light--don't flicker??? Don't see a way to get continuity
on pin 9 though.

&gt;Well, I found two wires not connected to anything. Hmmmm....maybe
&gt;there's a connection between these and why my bus will only start
&gt;briefly. Using an ohm meter, I was able to get 0 resistance
&gt;between one wire and pin 9 of the ECU plug...which maps to pin 9
&gt;of the intake air sensor. The other wire shows 0 resistance to pin
&gt;12 of the ECU. Problem is, I can't figure out where/how to hook these up.
&gt;
&gt;I have a '77 engine/FI system. From what I can tell in Bentley,
&gt;pin 12 is a dead end. It's probably for some option I don't have,
&gt;like smooth running engine (M-code 777). ;-)
&gt;
&gt;The wire to/from pin 9, however, probably ought to connect to
&gt;something. I'll be indebted to anyone who can help me figure this
&gt;out. These wires both come off the FI harness. They have female
&gt;ends encased in thin protective plastic shells...not thin like
&gt;M&amp;M; just thin if you think of normal VW connectors.
