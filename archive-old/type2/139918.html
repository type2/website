Subject: weight distribution

i was wondering if anyone knew the front to rear weight distribution of a 
bay window?  often on the vanagon list the discussion arises that the 
vanagon has pretty close to a 50-50 front to rear weight distribution and 
that fact causes poor wet and snow driving performance.  it is often said 
that bay window vans perform much better because of their rearward weight 
bias.  so i have been wondering what the bay windows weight distribution 
is.
