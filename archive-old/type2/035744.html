Subject: FI: idles, but dies on acceleration

I'm trying to get my AVP running. I found a bad double relay, but I'm still
not out of the woods. The problem I'm having is that a little acceleration
causes the engine to stall. Ironically, when I first start up, I can
accelerate with no trouble. After about 10 seconds, though, I can't. The
best description I can give is that she bogs down on acceleration.

Could this have to do with the #2 temp sensor inside the AFM? The #1 sensor
is brand new and I think that'll test out fine, though I haven't tried yet.

Thanks! Joe
