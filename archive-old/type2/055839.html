&gt;I have a '73 with dual carbs on and this bus hasn't run under my care yet.
&gt;The PO unhooked everything and didn't label.  Anyway I have dual manifolds
&gt;that each have one bolt on connection that runs a pipe between them and
&gt;also two push on connections, one near the top and one on the opposite
&gt;side facing bottom.  Can anyone tell what these push on connections run
&gt;to?  I assume one of these run to my brake booster but I am not even sure
&gt;where that it is.  Any help would be appreciated.
***********************************************

The Bolt-on Connections for the Pipe is for the EGR that is connected to
the EGR Filter.  73's had individual EGR valves on each manifold BTW, the
only year to do that.

The Push On connections at the Top are for the &quot;Mixture/Balance&quot; Spider
Tube assembly which runs along the top of the engine case.

The Push-on Connections at the Bottom are for the Balance Pipe that is
attached to the firewall AND the Brake Booster Hose Connection, usually
branching through the Firewall Tin on the left side (72's did it on the
right side).
