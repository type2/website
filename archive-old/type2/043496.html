Subject: Re: propane safety

The small bottles can be stored just about anywhere.  A propane torch with
one of these bottles lives in my tool box and has never vented any propane
even in LHC in summer.

Larger bottles should really go outside on a roof rack or such.  It isn't
legal to carry them inside a vehicle and some fill stations will even
refuse to fill them if you unload them from inside a vehicle. (solution:
park around the corner)  Campers store the bottle in a compartment vented
to the outside, motorhomes store them underneath, as do Westys.

You might want to stick with the small bottles.  They certainly cost more,
but the convenience might be worth it.  Many propane sellers have a
minimum purchase which makes the smaller refillable containers really
expensive to fill.

While cooking, you can put the bottles anywhere they are convenient using 
common sense, You do have a fire extinguisher, right?

&gt; you store them?  Both for driving &amp; while in camp?
