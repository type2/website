I know the reputation is well known. There is a section of I-15 here in Utah
that you WILL get pulled over if you drive a VW bus on, PERIOD. It may be a
3 minute stop, but you will be pulled over.

&gt;
&gt; this thread i cannot pass up.
&gt; i sent in a letter to (ahem) a certian Hot &amp;&amp;'s magazine about this same
&gt; topic, as they were saying that grateful dead stickers equal more police
&gt; interest on the roads. I came to the vw scene from the dead scene and
found
&gt; that i was in a wierd middle ground. first of all, i can say deadheads
love
&gt; the busses for the utility they provide. i slept 7 people in my 77 bus and
&gt; drove 14 people to a show in my 71 bus, for the music. you cant do that in
a
&gt; cavalier, or even a jetta for that matter. so, i started to feel funny
when
&gt; i was bringing my &quot;nearly show quality&quot; bus to dead shows and parking next
&gt; to busses that, due to all physical laws, should not work. there was a
&gt; tremendous amount of Muir knowledge in those dead show parking lots, so i
&gt; saw a lot of funky aberations. for example, an international harvester
&gt; school bus with a splitty top half and a super B top half both welded on
the
&gt; top. i actually got to crawl in there and see the sleeping setup, it was
&gt; much live being in a VW submarine. So, the short version of the story is
&gt; that the dead started touring in 1965 and the busses probably seemed ideal
&gt; for the purpose of following the tour. they are a natural fit and all the
&gt; vw/dead bumper stickers help to put the two together in everyone's
&gt; subconscious. i admit i feel a little like a stereotype when i have the
dead
&gt; on in my bus and i pull into a rest area. on the other hand, mabye my
button
&gt; up shirt and clean shaven face negates the image. one last thought, the
last
&gt; dead show i went to in 1995, i got a ride home from a 20 year deadhead,
&gt; several hundred concert veteran, in his LEXUS! So, there is my friday
&gt; morning sermon.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;what is interesting about the greatful dead, and what is their
connection
&gt; &gt;&gt;to
&gt; &gt;&gt;busses?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I can't explain a single other thing about those guys, but this one's
easy:
&gt; &gt;it was a hippie thing. The Dead had a lot to do with drugs and hippies,
and
&gt; &gt;buses did have a big part in the hippie movement.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I don't get it, personally. I do love the way it shocks people when they
&gt; &gt;pull up alongside a big old &quot;hippie van&quot; which is blaring the Sex
Pistols,
&gt; &gt;though.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;Pardon my pedantry.  I have only come here seeking knowledge; things
they
&gt; &gt;&gt;would not teach me of in college.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Good quoting job!
