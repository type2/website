Subject: Re: [T2] Location of 80 Westy Brake Fluid Reservoir ???

Lift the cover off over the cluster.....

&gt;Title pretty much says it all. I can't for the life of me find the brake
fluid reservoir....anywhere? Any help would be greatly appreciated. It's a
1980 air-cooled 2.0 L Westy. Thanks in advance.
