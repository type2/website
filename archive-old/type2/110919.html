Subject: can i get a starter by tomorrow?

I am going to check around today and see if i can find a starter somewheres..
i want a bosch starter rebuilt/new doesnt matter...
going to check on brushes for the one i have which isnt a bosch.
if it is the brushes that it burned up not sire cause of the wores touching what damage was done besides it is seized up.

Does anyone know where i could get one and have it sent to me by tomorrow or at least go and pick it up tomorrow in the buick....
Was really hopeing to have her up and running this weekend....
set the timing and be on my way....
well that was all before i accidentally fried the starter when i crossed 2 wires...
