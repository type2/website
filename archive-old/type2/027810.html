On holiday trip from Fla to Ala to see grandkids, ran across a really nice 
boneyard about 25 miles east of Tuscaloosa, right on US 82. Also had 
complete, and really messy shop, specializing in off-road stuff. Real 
surprise was running across a 78 7 passenger I used to own, right beside the 
shop! (my grandson-in-law..who lives in Georgia..had left it there for 
repairs).

Place is owned by a nice enough..well...mellow enough bunch of guys..who 
took the time to break apart &quot;Mickey&quot; while I watched, so I could report his 
status to the current owner.

Boneyard is about 3 acres, and has a little of everything, including KG, 
Thing, Notch, etc, but bugs and busses are there in-mass. &quot;Keiths&quot; is name 
of shop..but the Tuscaloosa pennysaver carries a different name. Anyone in 
that area who doesn't know of it, and needs a phone number..p-mail me.
