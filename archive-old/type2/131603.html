Subject: Re: [T2] 1700 upgrade to 2000, difficulties

Thanks Karl. Sounds like there would be a complete tear down in order to 
achieve the 2.0L. So if the stroke is different then the cranks are, too 
correct? Cam and lifters are they different as well?

Thanks,

&gt;From: &quot;Karl&quot;

&gt; &gt; Is the bottom end, ie short block of a 1700 suitable or interchangable 
&gt;with
&gt; &gt; P/C and heads for a 2.0L?
&gt; &gt; If I strip down the engine to a short block and replace the P/C and 
&gt;Heads
&gt; &gt; from the 1700 with the 2.0L  P/C and Heads, would this be a direct bolt 
&gt;on
&gt; &gt; application?
&gt; &gt; Would the rods, crank and cam be suitable for use without modification?
&gt;NO!

&gt; &gt; Is there a difference in stroke fom the 1700 to the 2000?
&gt;Yes, the stroke and rod length are different.
