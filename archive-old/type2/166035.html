Subject: Re: [T2] Transition from Gas to Diesel

You would think that with diesel now cheaper than regular unleaded that 
I would have progressed beyond what is described on page 4, but you'd be 
wrong.  :-(

I still think it's a good idea.  :-)

&gt; Hi Skyboy,

&gt; David Scharze is converting a bus to turbo diesel.  There is a lot of  
&gt; fabrication required, including motor mounts, transmission adapter,  
&gt; cooling system, and exhaust system. It is not a job for the  squeamish, 
&gt; or for those on a tight budget.
