Subject: Re: Stub axles - are '68-79 and 80-- the same?

&gt;Are the 'loaf (68-79) and brick (80-&gt;) stub axles the same?  on the one
&gt;hand, of course VW changed everything when they went to the vanagon; on
&gt;the other, a lot of things stayed the same.   I really can't think of a
&gt;reason to change the stub axle.  As a result, at least in theory, a 
'68-79
&gt;axle might do the job, and, if so, I can fix him up.

Steve,
Assuming that the stub axle is the same '68-'79 and not '72-'79 (maybe a 
Type 4 thing?) I don't think there is any difference between the Bus and 
Vanagon stub axle.  It doesn't seem like they would change it since the 
rear brakes are pretty much the same (at least from about '76 up) as are 
the tranny, CVs, etc.  It would probably work.
