Hey everyone,

	I have a question where does everyone get their parts.  I have been
getting some stuff through Rocky Mountain Motor Works and the stuff i can
get locally from a local parts shop.  I have come to realize that Rocky
Mountain Motor Works never has the parts i want in stock and that their
prices seem higher than many others.  I would just like to know if anyone
recommends a specific place i can get parts from.  

Also i have another question i am going to redo my exhaust.  I already have
a new muffler but i need new heat exchangers I was wondering if i can put
anything else on the bus besides heater boxes (like J tubes for the upright
engines).  I have a 74 Sportsmobile bus with a 1800 engine.  Thanks
