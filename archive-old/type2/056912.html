 Just got the bus today. Had a safety check done and now the engine
runs great.
The carb throttle valves were too far open causing the timing to be retarded
way too much at idle.
Hans the mechanic found and reset this.
He also found the end of #3 exhaust valve was hammered up a bit so removed
the rockers and stoned the end smooth.
I wasn't getting a very accurate adjustment.
2 new rear wheel cylinders and repairing the stuck rh front caliper piston
was also accomplished.
Had a run around with the MOT as some where in the last 25 years a digit was
lost on the registration so the serial # didn't jive. Hans also found this!
Had to go to the VW dealer with the bus and have them write a letter
stating the serial # was correct.
The dealer saw the vehicle and said he didn't have time!!!!!!!!
Bet if I was buying a new VW he would.
Drove back to the MOT in Strathroy and had a letter drawn up then faxed to
VW and refaxed back to MOT.
All this took from 8 am till 3pm.
Oh well got to drive 80miles today:)

Man I love this Bus!!!!!!!

Just thought you'd like to hear how the Contraption and I are.
