&gt;Haynes has volumes in litres and real pints/gallons. Bentley uses litres
and
&gt; the smaller USA pints/gallons.


Uh, oh, them sound like fighting words.  Next he'll be bragging about his
great Imperial gas mileage and how many &quot;real&quot; pints he can down at the
local pub and how Brit beer is real beer and how us lily livered tree
huggers can only drink water with bad taste that looks the same going in or
out.  I think it's &quot;go time&quot; (Hey what can I say the Mandelbaum re-run was
on Seinfeld the other night 8-)

Oh to keep this on topic, I'm wondering this must mean Haynes prints a
different late bay manual no?  Cause our late bay book covers no 1600 cars,
and our early bay book covers though '71 only.  Sort of neat, but makes me
wonder about the duplication when the Vanagon air cooled manual is the same
world wide (though for a much shorter production run.)  Also makes me wonder
if very late UK bays ever recieved the &quot;super&quot; late 1600 case with built in
full flow oiling and the like.  I've seen a German '76 which made it here
with only a regular T1 case.
