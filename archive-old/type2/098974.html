Actually, 19AA is kinda available, but it has to be modified to install
onto the window.  Looks like they increased the width slightly on the Late
87 Vanagon Sliding Window Tracks ever so slightly in the middle of 1987
(Vin 25-H-118681), then VW promptly discontinued any and all of these
slider pieces for the Bus and Vanagons up to Early 87 (real stupid I say).
I got a few of these several years ago for an Ex-80 Vanagon and my 84
Westy.  They're a pain to install with the window assembly in place, but it
can be done.  Once done, the window slides beautifully :-)  A buddy who
worked a Dealer parts counter told me about it way back when

VAG # 281-847-723 B - Last I looked they're about $1.10 from the VW Dealer.
 Pick a couple up and try them out.
