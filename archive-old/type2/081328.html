Subject: Re: [T2] Found a vacuum leak but...

&gt; Replaced the clamp and gained
&gt; 2.5 PSI on the vacuum gauge.

Vacuum is measured in Inches of Mercury, NOT psi. PSI is pressure.

&gt; Tonight's question is what should my manifold vacuum be at idle? I am
&gt; getting 14 PSI on my gauge connected with a T into the vacuum port that
&gt; supplies the fuel regulator.

14 inches of HG sounds like you have retarded timing.

&gt; Question 2 is my distributor vacuum connected to the correct port on the
&gt; throttle? It's connected to the port facing the rear of the bus on the
&gt; throttle body.

Is the nipple pointing to the rear bumper?
You say you have the 75 set-up. That means you are using the 75/early 76 dual
vacuum unit distributor?
The rear facing nipple is manifold vacuum for the retard side.

&gt; There is another facing the front that is capped off.

Pointing to the front of the bus? This is ported vacuum for the advance side.
If you are using the mid-76 and up single vacuum unit dist., it goes to this
port. Cap the rear facing nipple.
With no vacuum lines connected, set timing at 7.5 before at idle.
If you have the dual vacuum dist, connect manifold vacuum to the retard side
[inboard nipple pointing to the dist] and timing should go to 5 after.
At idle, you should have zero vacuum at the ported nipple. Connected to the
advance side [outboard nipple pointing away from the dist] your timing should
not change at idle.

&gt; This is a 75 FI setup

Just the FI? Or the whole engine/bus?
