For Sale:
1973 Westie.

Exterior:
Body is in excellent shape (pronounced &quot;as solid a bus as you could hope to find&quot; by another bus owner).  Very little surface rust on the vehicle, until summer of last year, it spent all its time in Arizona and Nevada.  Body is white over yellow.  The poptop functions fine, the canvas is in good shape.  

Interior:
As you open the sliding door, the little step-stool slides out and locks in place.  In the right side of the door, behind the passenger seat, is the sink and icebox.  Behind the drivers seat is a linen closet of sorts with a small (1 person) bench next to it (the person sitting on this bench faces out the door).  The attachment for the table is there in front of the bench.  To the left of the door is a cabinet that runs from the edge of the door to the back of the bus.  There is a front-facing bench between that cabinet and the far wall of the bus.  This bench folds down into a bed.  I have all the cushions for the fold down bed.  There is another shelf over the back of the interior, seemingly suspended from the ceiling and running from side to side.  The curtains are present.  There are also snap attachments for the mosquito netting.  I have what appears to be the original mosquito netting, rolled up and stored.  The passenger and driver's seats are old and in need of repadding.  The dash is in good shape.

Mechanical:
Engine was rebuilt nine years ago, ran a few times then and has not run since.  A ton of spare parts, including 3 engine cases (not counting the one installed), a spare carb, a lot of engine tin (I believe).  There is a good handful of spare parts, core parts and other parts.  

Why:
The bus belonged to my mother-in-law.  I used to always harass her with &quot;When can I haul that away?  When can I take that off your hands?&quot;  It was a pretty high price to pay for the bus when I inherited it from her when she passed away.  I was going to build a bus to be proud of, something to take the kids camping in on the weekends, something they could sleep in on Friday night if the mood struck them.  Now it turns out that I don't have the spirit in me.  As much as I loved my mother-in-law, this is one thing that I cannot do.  I want someone out there to buy it, take it off my hands, and use it for what it was intended.  

Where, how much, when:
It's located in Clinton, Tennessee.  I'd give GPS coordinates if I had them.  You can E-mail me at RHEARN_at_ICX.NET, or at work at Robert_Hearn_at_orcc.centrobe.eds_dot_com (maybe you should do both, just to make sure).  

I'm asking $1500 for the vehicle.
