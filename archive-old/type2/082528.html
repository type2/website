Dear List;

Both my rear wheel cylinders were shot, so ordered up 
new cylinders and shoes from Bob at VWTech (Thanks, 
Bob!), pulled all the old filthy stuff, no problems 
there, cleaned up all nice 'n squeaky &amp; put it all back 
together...  That was the ez part.  Actually, amazingly 
straightforward, all parts in good condition.

Then I go to adjust 'em.  With the adjusters backed off 
all the way, I can feel some rubbin' for about 1/4 of 
the revolution, but I go to it anyway, 3 clicks at a 
time, forever.  I got to where it's more difficult 
to turn, but the place of more resistance doesn't go 
away.  Not comfortable with this, I'm pretty sure 
they're not centered, even tho' I did a prelim bleed and 
stomped the pedal a bunch to try and get 'em centered.

I've read thru the archives, and here's my new plan:

1)  Pull the drums back off and kinda pre-adjust to make 
sure they are as centered as I can get 'em, just backed 
off enuf to get the drum back on.  Hopefully no fluid 
got in there from the messy bleeding.  (Should I have 
put a rag or something protecting the backing plate from 
lotsa fluid running over it?  Doh.)

2)  Then just a few turns of the adjusters SHOULD result 
in correct adjustment, right?  Adjust 'em up tight and 
back 'em off.

3)  The prelim bleed resulted in no bubbles, which I 
thought was odd.  Bently sez 1/2 turn on the valve, but 
I had to go like a turn and a half to get enuf fluid 
coming out to feel like it was doing something...  
Wrong?  It just didn't seem that any air was escaping 
anywhere.  I DID pop a dust cover over the lines asap as 
I removed 'em.  Maybe no air got in?

3)  Adjust first, bleed later, right?

What year did the spring cups and retaining pins go 
away?  Bentley sez they're 71 on, but my '79 has no 
sign.  Did the retaining pins make centering a 
non-issue?  Any other brake tips for a newbie?  I'm 
paranoid I'll screw this up, but then I always am.  ;-) 
 Is it true you'll blow the cylinders if you stomp the 
pedal with the drum removed?

Thanks again!

Teri
