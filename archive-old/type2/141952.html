&gt;I am looking for diagrams of distrubutor
&gt;advance/retard lines.

Here's the 72 version which should be the same:

&gt;I would also like to
&gt;see a good description of the ignition
&gt;circuit.

The wiring diagram is a good source:

http://66.34.72.138/wiring/bus-73-75.jpg

Follow terminal 15 on D (ignition switch) to N (ignition coil).

&gt;I see there is a ?thermostat?
&gt;on the right side of the engine compartment,

There is a thermostatically controlled preheater by the aircleaner intake.

&gt;several controls on the carbs,

&gt;and a vacuum
&gt;switch on the roof of the engine compartment.

The unit on the roof is the vacuum advance cutoff:

http://homepage.mac_dot_com/ratwell/VacuumHosesCarb/VacAdvCutoff.jpg

It's described in Bentley as disabling the vacuum advance while in the lower 3 gears. It was an emission device and hurts the engine in my opinion.

&gt;Also, there is a vacuum &quot;biscuit&quot; on each of
&gt;the intake manifolds.  What are these for?

I think those are the vacuum based temperature controls for the EGR pipes. See Bentley. If you don't have one, you should get one asap as it's much better than any other VW bus repair manual.
