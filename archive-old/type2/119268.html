Subject: Re: [T2] vacuum advance:  theory

flamefront burn speed (oxydation is the correct term) is dependent upon

mixture
Temperature (hotter is faster)
and how full the cylinder is with air and fuel.

The more full it is, the faster it oxidizes (burns). so,  mostly empty
cylinder burns slower, so it needs more spark advance to give the burn
enough time to produce pressure on the crank at the correct time.

That's all.

since centrifugal only distributors only &quot;sense&quot; RPM, that's why they are so
horrible at varying loads! You can only time it for RPM, so you have to time
them for &quot;worst case&quot;, which is full load (full throttle). you could time
them for light loads, but as soon as the engine is hot and you are more then
1/2 throttle, it would ping like made.

No street engine should be missing vacuum advance IMO, unless you love the
dark ages. Vac advance give better throttle response, 3-4 MPG improvement,
and a 15 degree drop in oil temps, compared to centrifugal only
distributors.
