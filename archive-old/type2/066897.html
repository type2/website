Subject: Where would you go in your VW? &lt;a friday question&gt;

&gt;Where would *you* go in *your* VW?

        I bit the bullet and went about $2K in debt this summer to do
Inuvik and the scenic route north and back... I still like the idea of Baja
next summer though... And the Texas-San Diego-Inuvik-Yellowstone-Texas loop
was really a great time, I wouldn't mind doing it again. But if I do, I
want a better equipped and less loaded bus, 3 months instead of 2, a wad of
cash to show Canadian Customs, and Light Truck tires...  ;-)

Peace,
