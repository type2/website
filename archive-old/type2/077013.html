Subject: Re: [T2] oil psi

If the engine is a recent rebuild or a good engine it can produce 100 PSI
with 20/50 Motor oil at 30 degrees.
My gauge is 6 BAR (approx 108 PSI) and it stays pegged out for the first
ten minutes, them settles in at 55/65  PSI at highway speeds, 35/40 PSI
normal city driving and 20-25 PSI at idle of 800/900 RPM.
The same engine can easily run at 60-70 PSI at highway speeds, at 200/250
degrees temp. 
The sending units for the idiot lights seldom cost more than $7.00 and
the VDO Gauge senders are about $29.00.
I just seal mine with non-hardening permatex, however I've got a grease
gun hose and a T setup to run both the idiot light and the gauge.
It is also not uncommon to see new idiot light senders that leak.

&gt; VW afficianados,
&gt; A friend of mine recently took her 78 westy to the shop and they 
&gt; attributed 
&gt; the majority of her oil leaks to the oil pressure switch not being 
&gt; torqued 
&gt; in enough. what kind of oil pressure does a 2.0 L generate? this is 
&gt; not 
&gt; urgent, i am just curious how much pressure would be pushing upwards 
&gt; towards 
&gt; that switch and the threads that hold it in?
