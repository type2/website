Subject: bus stopped in a bad place

i know it's impossible to diagnose via email and my
problem could be a result of a myriad of things.
But i'm in a bit of a bind.

my bus was running great. Then SUDDENLY started
missing badly and lost virtually all power. (In the
middle of downtown, of course)

I thot I had run outta gas (erratic gas gauge) and put
in a gallon, but it didn't help.

I was able to creep it out of a buzy street into a
parking lot--it was like one cyl. was firing. had to
tickle the gas pedal and ride the clutch.

THE parking lot owners says I GOTTA MOVE it ASAP. 

Just put a new fuel pump in Monday and did a tune up a
few weeks ago--points and condenser are fairly old.
Checked the wiring to the coil and nothing seems to be
shorting and all the sparkplug connections are solid
at both ends. Coil is bright.
Haven't been able to check dwell because I can't keep
the engine running long enough and don't have an
assistant.

Does anything leap to mind?
