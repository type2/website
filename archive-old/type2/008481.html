&gt; talking about rockers *and* lifters.  In other words, the lifters have
&gt; wheels on the cam end which &quot;ride&quot; over the lobes.  Roller rockers are nice
&gt; but they don't do much for cam wear - the roller lifters are what saves the
&gt; cam.  Because of the wheels on the ends, the lifters must not turn in the
&gt; bores so the engineering required would be more than just a simple lifter
&gt; swap.


This is done in the watercooled world all of the time, but
they dont use one lobe to work two lifters.

What I always thought would make a nice design would
be a spherical ball stamped into the end of the lifter, but
free to move around. Drill an oil passage through to the 
center, same as the pushrod lube path. A ball about the same
size as a CV ball should be about right. Being asymmetrical,
it could rotate any way it wanted, but could still rotate to
lessen friction. (Not as much as a roller would, though.)

First the lifters, then the WORLD! (Mad scientist laugh...)
