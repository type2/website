    What is a &quot;Penthouse&quot; pop-top...??
Penthouse is mfg by the sportsmobile company here inthe USA mine is an earlier version
of the one pictured at &quot;www.sportsmobile_dot_com&quot; I owned a '76 Kombi that a po had
taken to them for conversion, when it was wrecked, I mounted the penthouse on my '73
It's spring loaded &amp; pops straight up, sturdy &amp; roomy at the cost of being heavier 
than the stock westy top.
    when you say you have &quot;holes&quot; in the roof up front, are you talking
about the captured nuts for the hinges...??
Holes are from the bolts that held the plastic luggage carrier on the roof,
in front of the westy pop top.
    if this is the case, I would fabricate a thin (1/16&quot; plate) over the
holes and fasten it down using the correct size allen head countersunk
flathead bolts... makes a relatively unobtrusive repair that can be
reversed... using epoxy or welding them closed is WAY too permanent for
my taste...

    Just my $.02....
