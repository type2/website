&lt;&lt; A quick question first.  Everyone I have talked to says that I do not
 need to remove the 
 flyweel to break open the case.  Is this true?
 
 If the answer is yes, than I have a non-rebuildable case and i am looking
 to buy a short block.
 
 Either a good used or rebuilt.
 
 I have a 1.8L, will the heads work on a 1.7L or 2.0L. &gt;&gt;

you do.  the flywheel must come off to be able to get at one of the smaller
case bolts, which is directly behind the flywheel.  the case doesnt split
without removing that bolt, which doesnt come off without removing the f-
wheel....the few i have done they have ALL been that way.
