If you are determined to be &quot;correct&quot;, go ahead and buy the &quot;VW&quot; battery
they are probably trying to sell you.  It's the same battery designed for
and used in Beetles.

If you want reliable starting in Winter weather, and some reserve to handle
the camper's added electrical demands, buy a good quality Group 24 battery.
You can even install a Group 27 battery if you want.

Installing a non-standard battery sometimes requires a little ingenuity to
hold it in place, as often the stock
hold-down clamp won't work.  A very common arrangement is to install a Grp.
24 in a plastic marine/RV battery box for corrosion protection, then
stabilize it with blocks of wood cut to fit snugly around the base of the
box.  You can also use the hold-down brackets and strap that often comes
with the battery boxes, but that requires drilling some holes to bolt down
the brackets.

Some will complain that not using the stock hold-down isn't safe, but the
stock clamp is so flimsy it usually fails in any collision anyway.

FWIW.....

I know this has been talked about before but I couldn't
find a good answer.  I am looking for a new battery and wonder
if it mattered what one I buy. I asked a guy at Autozone to check
the price on a battery for my bus and he said the only one that
would work is $50.  After looking through the archive I saw some people
saying get a group 24 battery. The bently says I need a 54
amp hours battery.
Anyone got any suggestions on what kind to buy?
As in specs not brands, what works?

Thanks in advance

PS. Went camping last weekend and it rained most of the time
but we still had a wonderful time. We loved watching the
other people with tents scramble to pickup there tents
after it started pouring. Guess it got a little to wet for them ;)
