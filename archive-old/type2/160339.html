&gt; so i plan on pulling both heads on my 75 FI auto tranny.  i'm looking _at_ the

If you are paying a mechanic, I would do it for sure because of the labor cost to drop the engine twice. Otherwise, it's a matter of the health of the other head. You had 105-115psi compression on the good head right?

I'd do a leakdown test before deciding what to do with the head, but with those above compression figures your new head might just be in ballpark anyway and end up somewhat of a match. If your new head is exceptional (135psi) then I think you should put two new heads on if you can afford it.

&gt;do i need to replace the head studs or bolts?

No.

&gt;and finally what is lapping?

The use of a grinding paste to improve the seal between the valve head and valve seat. There are pros and cons to doing it.
