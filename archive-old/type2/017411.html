While it's still Friday.....

My band (Dr. Bombay) played a small club here in Richmond, Virginia,
USA, tonight... the first thing I saw when I walked in the door was a
splittie front end (from the doors forward) that had been &quot;Greatful
Deadisized&quot; and made into the sound booth for the club...don't know what
year, being a loaf guy, but it was very solid, all the lights were in
great shape, nice bumper with overriders, etc...what a waste (regardless
of how cool it looked)...oh well.
