Just a little humor to my day.  My daughter's 86 Sentra broke a alternator
bracket.  I was fixing that when she calls.  Says that the battery light in
my 96 Grand Am has come on.  I tell her to bring it home &amp; while on the way
the ABS light also comes on.  The dealer says it is probably the alternator
&amp; to bring it in.  The only thing working is my good old 79 Std. bus.  Thank
God for my VW.  Think I will sell the Grand Am &amp; the Sentra &amp; buy here a
Bug.
