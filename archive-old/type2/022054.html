&gt;  Sorry to dice with starting another FART, but I've got to get some 
&gt; comments on
&gt;  what happened the other night:
&gt;  
&gt;  I was looking over a rusty bus for a friend (He has an LHD late bay - no 
&gt; sills
&gt;  or interior - and had been offered a rusty, engineless, RHD '73 camper in 
&gt; lieu
&gt;  of some cash for a computer deal). The owner of the camper has put 300k 
&gt; miles on
&gt;  it, and gone through 3 engines. He still has the last engine which he has 
&gt; pulled
&gt;  to put into a '63? &quot;American model&quot;? Beetle. We talk about where he has 
been,
&gt; 
&gt;  and I comment that it must have been expensive on petrol for his regular 
&gt; trips
&gt;  to London, Scotland, etc. This is where he drops his bombshell: 28-30 mpg 
&gt; around
&gt;  town, 32-35 mpg on a long run. I am politely sceptical about this, so he 
&gt; takes
&gt;  me into his garage where he is &quot;tarting up&quot; the engine, and says &quot;What you 
&gt; need
&gt;  is that set-up&quot;. 
&gt;  
&gt;  He has a 1600DP with an extractor exhaust (EMPI), a dual choke progressive
&gt;  Webber on a trick manifold (looks like the stock centre portion without the
&gt;  heater pipes, except there is a square alloy casting where the upright tube
&gt;  would be, which mates up with the Webber carb. He says he also has bigger 
&gt; valves
&gt;  in the heads, and a mild cam, but the carb / exhaust were the magic. 
Claims 
&gt; he
&gt;  could get the bus upto 80mph with this set-up. He's an intelligent bloke, I
&gt;  don't think he's BSing, he's obviously had the bus long enough to know it 
&gt; inside
&gt;  out, but 35 mpg!! Imperial gallons, that is -  more than 40 mp(US)g ?
&gt;  
&gt;  Can there be any truth in this? :O
&gt;  
&gt;  I asked him what carb it was, and he couldn't remember, but guessed at 
&gt; DCOE35.
&gt;  
&gt;  For those of you across the pond, we pay the equivalent of $4.50 per US 
&gt; gallon
&gt;  for petrol, so this is very dear to my heart, and is the only serious 
threat 
&gt; to
&gt;  a lifetime's partnership with my bus. I've seen the mileage figures on the 
&gt; web
&gt;  page, and mine currently tally with some of the better ones there (20 
mp(UK)
&gt; g).
&gt;  
&gt;  If there is any truth in this, where can I get hold of the correct carb? (
&gt; His
&gt;  carb isn't for sale). I've seen oblique references to using progressive 
&gt; carbs
&gt;  from other makes of car - is there any proven combination?
&gt;  
&gt;  If there isn't, then it's back to trying to source a Bosch CIS injection 
set-
&gt; up.
&gt;  (I get what I assume to be the normal, poor, part-throttle response with a
&gt;  34-pict3 (tried 2, also tried plugging the hole in the throttle plate) and 
&gt; the
&gt;  009. I've got several vac advance distributors, but I can't get any better
&gt;  mileage or drive-ability with them than the 009. I haven't tried opening 
up 
&gt; the
&gt;  main jet - I'm a bit reluctant as it isn't reversible, and I may end up 
with
&gt;  worse mileage than I have now. Exhaust is stock, valves, compression, etc. 
&gt; are
&gt;  OK. Work continues.)

Hi Andy,

I would say 35mpg is exceptional. I used to get 25mpg from my 1600cc '73 and 
now get around 26mpg from my 1998 1600 with FI (although thats at 55 to 60 
mph rather than 50 to 55mph [slower on hills] in the '73). all mpg in 
imperial gallons.

I've met people who claim slightly more than 25mpg but not much. I believed 
the guy who said he got 30mpg from a 1645cc type 1 engine but I think he 
would have been at the top end of possible.

So unless every thing in the engine is immaculately balanced, the head has 
larger ports, he has a large bore extractor exhaust, and everything else is 
in the running gear is better than new, I would think 35mpg was at best 
optimistic.

I did once get 28 mpg between fill-ups; but at next fill-up I only got 20 
mpg. I put this down to the middle fill-up being not so full as the two on 
each side because driving conditions were the same throughout.

If you are looking for an FI system for a 1600 upright dont overlook the 
pulsed injection system fitted by VW to current production 1600 engines in 
Mexican Beetles - works well.

Good luck
