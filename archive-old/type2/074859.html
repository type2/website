Subject: Re: [T2] Wanted: Bus Towbar

Rick, Mike:
Huh? I guess from the thousands of miles that I flat-towed buses, Vanagons
and Porsches (356 and 911), I'd have known about this!
I SAY that there is nothing wrong with towing a MANUAL TRANSMISSION type 2
with the axles in. NOT an automatic!
Al Brase
69 double cab, 80 westy (both towed home- non-runners!)

&gt; Hi Mike,
&gt; its my guess that the rule of not towing a Bus with
&gt; the drive shafts connected would hold true for a bug
&gt; b/c we have the same principles working in the tranys.
