Subject: eerr,eerr ,eerr,  Hard Start

When The weather gets hot, the bus is hard to start. When I turn the key all 
the way to start the bus. It just keeps trying to start          ( STARTER AND 
BATTERY SOUND STRONG)   but it won`t START until after about five attempts.
This only happens when the temperature outside is hot or if the bus has been 
running and the bus is hot.  BUS HAS NEVER HAD THIS PROBLEM BEFORE, I`M 
CONCERNED THAT I MAY GET STRANDED FAR FROM HOME.  In the morning when the temp and 
bus are cool, the bus starts immediately. Any answer will be appreciated..
I guess if I hold down the key long enough it will probably start, but I get 
concerned about holding the key in the start position to long. It occurs to me 
that all that, eerr , errr ,errr ,errr , might hurt something.

Thank You Very Much
