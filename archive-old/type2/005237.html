Randy and All;

A couple of years ago we had similar problems with Bosch plugs working loose
and popping out, but on a 1600SP engine.

Careful inspection showed that the threads in the head were undamaged and
met VW specs, and _visually_ the offending plugs looked OK.  But after being
re-installed and carefully torqued they worked loose again.

We tossed the whole set and installed new Bosch plugs, and that solved the
problem.  Bosch was queried about this anomaly, but had no explanation.

The Bosch plugs that were troublesome were stamped &quot;Made in India&quot;.  Since
then we insist on German-made Bosch plugs, and that may be why we've had no
more trouble.  Even the Bosch distributor claimed to be unaware that some of
their plugs were made in India!

You have to be careful, as we've found sealed boxes of Bosch plugs with
plugs made in 3 different countries inside [Brazil, Germany, India].

This is also a good argument for carrying an inexpensive metric socket set
that includes a plug wrench, along with a gap gauge in case a plug gets
dropped or bumped and re-gapping is necessary.  Might also be handy,
especially with a Type 4 engine and it's awkward plug angles and tinwork, to
carry a flexible pickup tool or magnet...

Glad you got back home OK.....

&gt;&gt;  I used the spark plug wire as a plug wrench and installed the plug
hand-tight.  Fired her up, the engine
didn't sound/feel any different than normal, so we continued home, listening
carefully.

This evening, I'll be re-torqueing # 2 and inspecting all my plugs for
proper tightness.  What would make a spark plug loosen itself like this?  &lt;&lt;
