Subject: Re: [T2] Gas vapor breather lines 

&gt; Is it possible to remove the metal breather lines that come from the gas
&gt; tank? These goes rusty over time...what do people do about these when they
&gt; repaint their bus?

I don't know about removing them -- I was looking into that myself and it
seems tricky at least. Mine are copper -- I don't understand how they
could rust. I'm preparing to paint right now, and am meticulously removing
the old paint from them. It's not fun. My plan is to leave the breathers
in place and repaint them along with the rest of the fuel tank compartment.
 
&gt; The whole intake area seems tricky to paint...

I have the gas tank out and am doing the whole engine/fuel compartments.
Paint removal is proving difficult. I have some really good aircraft
stripper -- lots of Methylene Chloride and Ammonia -- and it gets about
95% of the paint off in minutes. The other 5% is proving quite stubborn,
and I've spent a lot of time with little wire brushes. VW also put
a lot of caulk around the engine compartment, and I'm removing that before
repainting. It's a heck of a lot of work, but there is surface rust all
over the place, and as POR-15 is only effective when in direct contact
with the bare metal, I feel it important to go all the way down to
bare metal. 

If this is what you're doing -- good luck, as you'll spend many many
hours removing paint. The results should be well worth the effort, though.

I'll post pics when I have made some real progress.
