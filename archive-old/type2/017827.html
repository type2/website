Subject: TGIF: Results of 'Other Car' Survey (long)
Message-ID: &lt;3729A867.FE365F83_at_gmx_dot_de&gt;

Hi Volks,

these are the results of the 'Your &quot;Other Car&quot;' Survey I
posted last friday.  I think I have some interesting findings 
to report.  Be forewarned: this is long.

People who answered this survey:            59

Rather more than expected, thanks to all who did!

Some of the numbers don't seem to add up, or match.  That's
because several of you have both other VWs and other classic
cars, or because I counted in the motorcycles with the 
ratings but left them out with the makes, or because I lost
count somewhere, or because some of you chose not to answer
part of the survey.  These results may be inaccurate, but
they are correct.  :-)


Number of Cars

Here's how many of you have how many vehicles of which kind.
I grouped them into Buses, Other Aircooled Volkswagens (ACVWs),
Other Classics, and Other Cars.

No Bus                                       2
1 Bus                                       43
2 Buses                                     11
3 Buses                                      3
= Total of Bus owners:                      57
Average number of Buses owned:               1.3

No other ACVW                               48
1 other ACVW                                 7
2 other ACVWs                                4
= Total of Other ACVW owners:               11
Average number of Other ACVWs owned:         0.3

No other classic                            53
1 other classic                              5
2 other classics                             1
= Total of Other Classic owners:             6
Average number of Other Classics owned:      0.1

No other car                                23
1 other car                                 27
2 other cars                                 6
3 other cars                                 2
4 other cars                                 1
5 other cars                                 1
= Total of Other Car owners:                36
Average number of Other Cars owned:          0.9

Motorcycles etc.                            4


Other Cars by Make

Here's the makers of the cars in the Other Classics category,
and the number of cars (not owners) per maker, ordered
alphabetically:
Austin Mini [or is it Leyland? or Rover?]   1
Chevrolet                                   1

Ratings

If 0 is junk, and 10 is perfect, you rated...

...your Buses, which I stupidly didn't ask for, hence
the limited amount of data on this one:
 0:         1
 2:         1
 4:         1
 5:         3
 6:         3
 7:         2
10:         3
Average:   83/14 = 5.9

...your Other ACVWs:
 2:         1
 3:         1
 4:         1
 5:         2
 7:         1
 9:         1
10:         1
Average:   45/8 = 5.6

...your Other Classics:
 3:         1
 5:         2
 7:         2
 8:         2
 9:         4
10:         3
Average:  109/14 = 7.7 

...your Other Cars:
 2:         1
 3:         2
 4:         8
 5:         10
 6:         11
 7:         4
 8:         6
 9:         2
10:         1
Average:  260/45 = 5.8 

So it follows: If a Bus Nut has another classic car, that 
one's definitely more upscale than a Bus, Other ACVW or
Other Car s/he might own.  But see below on giving the Bus
up!


Which One Is Driven Most?

Bus(es) more than other car(s)...
   in Summer                                20
   in Winter w/o salt                       7
   in Winter w/ salt                        3   
   
Very clearly we see the Buses' use as summer vehicles with
the majority of Listees.  Very few use their Buses as the
main vehicle in salt and snow.  I am very pleased.  :-)

Bus(es) equal as other car(s)...
   in Summer                                14
   in Winter w/o salt                       7
   in Winter w/ salt                        4
   
Again, the trend to pamper your Buses is unambiguous: out
of 76 buses you all own, only 7 are not replaced with 
something else during salted winter.

Other Cars more than Bus(es)...
   in Summer                                11
   in Winter w/o salt                       10
   in Winter w/ salt                        13
   
One quotable reply to the question whether or not they salted the
roads where you lived was, &quot;No, it is too hot and the salt melts.&quot;
You got me ROTFL, man.  In office.  :-)

Another one said,
    &quot;Busses &quot;park&quot; in the winter up here in the high Country of Colorado,
     primarily because of the poor heat, secondarily due to traction.&quot;
    [Traction?  Yours must be winters I have never seen the like of.]


Enthusiasm For Your Other Cars

If Buses rate 10 as a given fixed point on the scale, 
you rate your...

...other ACVWs:
 2:         1 [a poor Thing in the true sense of the meaning]
 7:         1
 8:         2
10:         3
15:         2 [a Super Beetle and a bunch of Type 3s]
Average:    77/9 = 8.6

We see that those who have other ACVWs have them very
conciously these days.

...other classics:
 5:         1
 8:         3
 9:         3
10:         6
15:         1
19:         1 [an MG Midget gets the all-time high]
Average:    150/15 = 10.0

Those who have non-Volkswagen classics tend to show
equal enthiusiasm for them as they do for their Buses.
However, even they tend to opt for giving up their 
other classic rather than the Bus, for practical and
financial reasons, as you can see below.

...other cars:
 0:         1
 2:         3
 3:         3
 4:         1
 5:         7
 6:         5
 7:         4
 8:         6
 9:         4
10:         3
15:         2
18:         1 [an S-10 pickup, of all cars]
Average:    274/40 = 6.9

The enthusiasm for your other cars is rather limited,
however, if we discard some fairly notable exceptions.


Giving It Up?

Surprisingly few of you however would be willing to
give up on bus ownership:

Bus goes last                               30
Bus goes not first                          3
Bus goes first                              7
not applicable                              6 [read: refused to answer]

Quotable replies on that one:

    &quot;dont ask questions like that&quot;
    [Sorry.]

    &quot;I'd keep both buses if economy were the most important thing. A bus 
     is the cheapest possible transport if you know a bit about how to 
     work on it.
     Corollary: I have two buses because I'm always broke.&quot;
    [Congratulations on your reasoning!]

    &quot;Would ditch the Lambretta [scooters] first, then the vespa [scooter], 
     then the house.  Keep the VW and the Heinkel [scooter]. The VW can 
     serve as both house and garage for the scooter.&quot;
    [There's someone who can set priorities...]

    &quot;I'd dump the Suzuki [motorcycle]. Can't go camping in it.&quot;
    [Ever heard of something called a &quot;tent&quot;?]

    &quot;If I were to lose [...] any of my buses, it would be like mourning 
     a member of the family.
    [Common feeling I think, though few actually said it.]
    
    
Temptations

What would you be willing to give up your Bus for, I dared
ask.  The results show again that we consider our Buses very
much a part of the family:

never would give up Bus                     23
Bus would be given up for...
...very improbable pipe dream               2
...other Bus                                15
...other ACVW                               4
...other classic                            4
...specific other car                       1 
...any other car                            3
...not applicable                           1

Both the other classics (Porsche, Studebaker, Cadillac, Austin Healey)
and the single specific other car (Mercedes Convertible) sound very 
much like pipe dreams too to me (sorry volks! :-).  So, except for 
the three of you who'd ditch the bus for any other car (&quot;provided 
it has heat&quot; as one put it), we're pretty much rooted in bus or at 
least ACVW ownership.

Quotable Replies:

    &quot;DON'T GO THERE!&quot;
    [I take that as a &quot;no&quot; then.]

    &quot;Something that I could sell to buy two good buses.&quot;
    [Hmmm... &quot;pipe dream&quot; or &quot;other bus&quot;?  Let's say &quot;other bus&quot; shall we?]

    &quot;Is this a trick question?&quot;
    [No it isn't.]

    &quot;I keep trying to trade the buses for a Mercedes convertible but nobody is
     wise enough to take advantage of me.&quot;
    [Just keep trying, buses don't lose their value like Mercedeses do.]

    &quot;When I suggested that I might sell the bus to my wife, her response was a
     very emphatic NO!  I didn't know she cared so much.&quot;
    [You are a luckier man than I am.]
    
    &quot;Otherwise, you can keep them all. All I really need is a good VW 
     splittie!&quot;
    [I can keep 'em all?  Great!  Where are they?  ;-)]


Questions I Should Have Asked

Two of you missed other questions in this survey.  Maybe someone else
would be willing to do these as seperate surveys?  Rest assured it's
a fun thing to do.

     &quot;I would include also some mechanical questions like to which degree
      people do work on their busses, like if they do only regular 
      maintenance type work (tune ups etc) or all the way up to rebuilding
      motors on their own etc.&quot;
     
     &quot;May I suggest some demographic information be included? Age, sex, 
      nationality, education, type of employment? It would be interesting to 
      see who we really are or if there is a archetypal VW bus owner.&quot;


Odds and Ends

For closing, a few more quotable replies, with comments that I added
to save me the bother of replying to you all individually:
    
    &quot;I’d like [my bus] to be a daily drive but want to preserve it for 
     trips on vacations - usually about 5000 miles a year.&quot;
    [Same here.]

    &quot;is there such a thing as a Vanagon Syncro Diesel? It would be a 
     real trip to have one of those!&quot;
    [Yes there is -- Euro only I'm afraid though :-(]
    
    [In reply to me babbling, &quot;and what do those who don't drive them 
     daily drive daily&quot;:]
    &quot;Sometimes I wonder about you, Erik, the above is a clause that only a
     native English speaker could write.&quot;
    [Or an enthusiastic reader of Douglas Adams.]
    
    &quot;LOWER IS BETTER!  and if it runs DRIVE IT!&quot;
    [To each their own.]
    
    &quot;Cool test, made me set the priorities and figure out the personal worth
    of my vehicles.&quot;
    [That, and satisfying my curiosity, were its intentions.]
    
    &quot;I also call bullshit on the 'I could never sell it', everthing is 
     for sale, its the price that is in question.&quot;
    [I agree... but I love it so much I could never sell it for as much 
     as anyone'd offer.]
    
    &quot;type2_dot_com rules!&quot;
    [This goes without saying!]

    
Thanks to everyone who replied!  And particularly, thanks to everyone
for not posting a single reply to either list.  I'm very proud of
you.  :-)

Airhowlingly yours,
    Erik.
