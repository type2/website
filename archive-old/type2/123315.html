Subject: RE: [T2] Differnt Speedometer question

Ted,

Time to decide how important correct speed is to you then.

There is a procedure to adjust the speed shown given the
correct tire size, but it requires tearing your speedo apart and
then calibrating it on a table with the correct rpm's matched to
your tires.

I've done it on a bug speedo a long time ago and it is just a &quot;touchy&quot;
trial and error type of thing.

Or as several folks have pointed out, send it out to the speedo shop
and pay for the rebuild and calibration service.

Cheers, dave

&gt; To all of those asking about the tires, I'm running stock rims with Yokohama
&gt; Y356 tires.  185R14. In fact, these are the same rims and tires that I had
&gt; installed on my 76 bus and the speedometer is the same one off of it.  The
&gt; rims, tires and speedometer were transplanted to my 78 bus.  I have
&gt; confirmed my MPH via GPS and I know that it is off.

&gt; Thanks,
