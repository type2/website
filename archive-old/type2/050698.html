Subject: [T2] Odd BN4 donor

I ran across a site (the url is at home, sorry) that showed a 70's era
beetle with a BN4 installed next to the fuel tank on the driver's side
(USA).  Besides plumbing and ducting, is this the same furnace that's
installed in the type 2s?  Was this common or a special option?  Any
likelihood of finding them in the bone yards?
