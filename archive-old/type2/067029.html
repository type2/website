This is not normal.  Previous post of mine disclosed various problems 
with non-built-in-resistor coil.  One of the symptoms is that points last 
about 200 miles before being fried (need the resistor to lower power 
to points).  Another possible cause is the condenser is shot.
If any of the wiring from the coil to the distributor is under size, 
through age or mis-wiring could cause improper voltage.  Be sure that 
you are using the correct points for that particular distributor.

Get out and VOTE on November 5th (USA folks that is !)

&gt; Does anyone have problems with their points in a type IV motor. 
&gt; I am changing points about ever couple months now and wonder if this is
&gt; normal. I just moved about four months ago and now live in a very hilly
&gt; area of town that has a lot of stop and go traffic. Could this be the
&gt; problem. I used to live out in the country were it is flat and nonstop
&gt; roads except that stop sign that I missed. 
&gt; I don't think this is the problem though. I thought that maybe it was not
&gt; timed right, took it to a good mechanic and had it timed and the points
&gt; adjusted. But it is still going through those points. Since summer I have
&gt; replaced them at least three times.
