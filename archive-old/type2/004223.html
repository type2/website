to all ye knowledgable folk.....
I am trying to replace my 009 dizzy with a vacum unit and picked up the
following one for a decent price.
It is a Bosch unit with the following info :
JFU 4 &lt;
0 231 146 101
113 905 205 AL

I have a 1600cc upright in a 1971. A 34PICT3 carb with the vacuum currently
blocked. I run on unleaded.
Can I use this Dizzy......is it a vacuum only or does it have weights as
well ?
Am I a plonker for not doing this research prior to handing over the cash,
albeit very little.

P.S. also got a pair of Solex carbs 32-34 PDSIT 2 from a later
bus........_dot_can the oil bath in my bus be moved and adapted to these carbs
or am I going to need paper air filters should I wish to use these at a
later date ?

Thank you all as ever.
Garp and family
