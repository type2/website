&gt;wonder I don't explode walking past smokers.  Do petroleum and similar
&gt;solvents make it through the latex at all?  What about the old oil and
&gt;rubber problem?
***
with nothing else to use besides paint thinner [mineral spirits] the rubber
gloves i purchased seem to... lose their elasticity and become baggy on my
fingers [much quicker if i submerse my fingers to dig out a nut or washer.
the bagginess doesn't make things too difficult while cleaning, but they
begin to shred/fall apart before too long.  it's my belief the latex gloves
are inpenatrable [used to work in nursing/emergency medicine] to even
microscopics.  however, there are obviously some reactions/interactions
with some solvents
as for being porus - hands ever sweat in them? there certainly isn't any
breathablity.

There's a product called Derma-Shield [came across it in the medworld]
which after an application would protect your otherwise unprotected skin
&gt;from even Hydrochloric Acid.

by the way...
i threw #2 - rod berrings were a sight to see. with total machinists bill
and parts [crank probably won't make it] i think it would be more cost
efficient and certainly a quicker process [road worthy asap necessary] to
order a long block.
	suggestions?
	vwparts_dot_net has them for $600 - so i'm looking at about $800-$900 to put
it all back together [plus my suspension nightmare] is this the best price
and quality long block i can hope for for the price?
