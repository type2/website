Subject: Welding Equipment (nothing whatsoever to do with any other
  topic)

So with all the welding talk, has me wanting to ask some questions if anyone who actually has experience here knows.  I've followed some online welding forums but opinions differ and are often strongly influenced by brand loyalty.  I can weld, been doing it for about 20 years now, learned stick on a 50's vintage Lincoln buzzbox, eventually bought my MIG senior year of high school back in '88.  Despite snotty opinions to the other BTW, mine is an old Century 110V 100amp box, perhaps built at the very end of Century's time in the US, maybe import, hard to tell.  I bought that 110V box specifically over a 220V at the time because I wanted the portability, and because for sheetmetal work a friend of the family who has been a certified aircraft welder for 30 years stated that it was all I needed.  He has been correct BTW, I don't use it for anything over 1/8&quot; because I stick that, and it has been all I needed, including for some ugly but functional forrays into aluminum.  I've
 used it countless times in the field for repairs on a long heavy gage cord or an Onan generator and have never looked back on the 110V choice, plus at the time, even it cost me $550, the 180amp was several hundred more.  Anyway I digress.  So now that I am again gainfully employed and somewhat settled, I'm really wanting to try TIG for both sheetmetal that needs some afterwords hammer rework, and for aluminum.  The same friend of the family recced a Miller Econotig for at home use, he has one, the local welding shop who sells both Miller and Lincoln, says the $1900 or so Lincoln is better value.  Now I truly think both of these are off shore manufacture, Lincoln, and Hobart definitely are now days, and I'm pretty sure low end Miller stuff is as well.  This is for me a hobby machine, and purely a splurge, so I can weld up a bit of aluminum gas/fluid tight myself at home.  It has me wondering about all the combo machines available on ebay that stick, TIG, and plasma cut, and
 cost in the $800-$1000 range.  The plasma cutter was my next toy, in WV I co-bought one with a friend but he bought me out of it when I moved and I like having one availble.  Anyone have any experience with these cheap, but not so cheap inverter units from China?  When pushing $1000 it is a bit hard to shell it out if it ends up being junk, but I realize that in todays world the nice blue, red, or gray (Who song BTW) cases of the big 3 left in the US don't mean US make or quality either.  Century went nicely belly up after all, only to be purchased in name by Lincoln I think, and the only real benefit of those names, spare parts availability, may not be garanteed.  I'm not a welding snob and will try anything if I know it will last at least 5 years.  If anyone has any PERSONAL HANDS ON experience with any of these, give me a pmail.
   
  Thanks
  John
