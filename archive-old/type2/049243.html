Subject: [T2] Dies at idle:

Hi Dallas,

    A hard one to diagnosis with out laying hands on the car, But I would
look for a lean mixture from experience. The idle circuit in Volkswagen
carburetors is very small, and is most likely your trouble, but------------.
First check all of the base adjustments, timing, dwell, valve adjustment,
base idle adjustments, etc., look for vacuum leaks. If all of these are
good, then take a good look at the carburetor.
    If you have excess to compressed air, you could try blowing out the idle
circuits, air correction jet, and re-adjusting the air/fuel mixture.
    If your having trouble getting a diagnosis, after checking these things,
you may have to take it to a technician $$$$$$$$ sorry.
