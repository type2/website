&gt; someone made something like that for the Type IV.  

Someone does make headers for the 72-78 bus. European
Motorworks (Hawthorne, CA 1-800-722-8678) has 'em. See
the July issue or Hot VW's (page 103). From their ad:
&quot;headers are made of rust-resistant chrome or
zinc-plated 1 5/8&quot; mandrel bent tubing with a hand
made merge collector. Exhausts bolt directly to the
head with stub tubes. Heater box replacement(pr) $165.

These headers look like the have the duel inlet found
on the 17-1800 engines. The headers along with a
&quot;bugpack&quot; style extracter and muffler would make for a
nice (under $300) exhaust system.

Hope this helps,
