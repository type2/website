Subject: Re: [T2] let me try to type slower


&gt;i read that the shafts are the same, but are the c/v joints the same too. 
&gt;what we have here is both shafts out ready to to take apart and install 
&gt;new boots and repack(not in that order). what i need to know is if it 
&gt;makes a diffrence as to which c/v goes to the trans and the one that goes 
&gt;to the wheel.
&gt;
&gt;man do i really have to take apart that whole c/v to replace the boot ! 
&gt;should have got the leaky kind you bolt on.

The bolt on boots are short term solutions. The regular boots are long term 
IF you can find decent boots.

I have seen the bolt on boots last longer than the cheap aftermarket boots 
(mine lasted less than a year).

Basically you don't have to disassemble the joint, just take it off of the 
axle. I'd properly clean and pack the joint with grease since you are there 
anyhow. Just depends I suppose on how you feel about maintenance.

Give up those cigs man - they'll kill ya - it's confirmed! &lt;grin&gt;
