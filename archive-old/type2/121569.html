&gt;&gt;Superior in what way??????????
&gt;
&gt;James Hayden and I have already been over this a couple of times.

Ok, does that mean you still demand that I acknowledge that what you say is 
factual. Or am I off the hook now that someone else has climbed on your 
wagon. 2 against 1, I lose, boo hoo.


&gt;&gt;&gt;  Even if it died every five years I would carry a spare and use it 
&gt;&gt;&gt; because it does a more consistent job of keeping the batteries charged 
&gt;&gt;&gt; than a stock mechanical regulator.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Just cause you say it doesn't make it true.
&gt;
&gt;Fair enough.  Let me rephrase that - &quot;It does a more consistent job of 
&gt;keeping MY batteries charged than MY stock regulator did&quot;.

Is this before or after you fixed the problem that killed the original 
regulator??


&gt;&gt;&gt;It takes more time/money/skill to make a product superior.
&gt;
&gt;Not always true.  Some products are superior by virtue of more modern 
&gt;technology,

Some new technology is released too soon, before problems have been rooted 
out. Recall what I offered about the current ignition tech. That is an 
example that goes against the rule.  It is a very rare annomaly. But with 
exceptions rare as hen's teeth, more skill and effort means better work. 
It's only an opinion David, don't take it personally.

&gt;  and often they are simpler and less expensive to produce at the same 
&gt; time.  Do you think that parts designed in the '60's are the best that 
&gt; ever were and will be?  Please.  Better tell John_at_aircooled not to sell 
&gt; any more Mallory distributors (or SVDA) as they are not stock, and 
&gt; therefore inferior according to you.

Stock ist beste. Again, it's just an opinion. Don't take it personally. 
That you do I find childish. That you attempt to coerce me into validating 
your opinion when I have reason to differ I find childish as well.


&gt;&gt;&gt;I will ask the question again - please answer it this time.  How did you 
&gt;&gt;&gt;determine that the regulator was stressed by poor connections?  Or an 
&gt;&gt;&gt;alternator or starter for that matter?  Please provide the tech behind 
&gt;&gt;&gt;this assertion... or are you simply making assumptions?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I am reporting observations. Melted insulation, frayed wires, tarnished 
&gt;&gt;fittings, corrosion, porous solder, resin weeping from solder, purdy 
&gt;&gt;colors on terminals, quicky-cheap terminals, dirty batteries. In every 
&gt;&gt;case excess resistance building heat at the weakest point in the circuit.
&gt;&gt;One example: 1959 Mercedes 190, unknown huge mileage. Starter motor 
&gt;&gt;problem.&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Again, you did not explain how spliced wires, etc. caused the starter to 
&gt;fail. That does not explain how or why the regulator failed.

Electric Circuits 101 (actually, I learned this in HS shop over 30 years ago.)
Resistance equals heat. If there is resistance in the circuit, that portion 
of the circuit which can least take the heat will fry.

That's how points in relays get fried by bad battery cables. Same reason 
why a loose nut at the solenoid can overheat the ignition switch contacts. 
And the same type sources can overload the alternator components, 
overheating the brushes and commutator and diodes. The same reason accounts 
for an overheated starter motor with circuit resistance at the tranny 
ground strap. You need to catch up on some foundation knowledge here, 
David. Poor connections fry components elsewhere in the circuit. It's a 
fact of physics you are going to have to accept least you waste a lot of 
time/money on electrical diagnosis and repair.

Adequate maintenance means all connections are maintained clean and tight 
for low resistance at all times. That's why I say, failure to keep this 
stuff in good order is lack of adequate maintenance and does indeed lead to 
failures. Only the ignorant then bitch at the part that failed and testify 
as fact that the part was the source of the problem. They are so danged 
certain they are right that they demand others to validate their 
conclusion. They can go get a rope and a half rack of beer as far as I am 
concerned.


&gt;&gt;If it does last that long, it will be due to keeping the battery and 
&gt;&gt;cables and terminals clean and tight via proper maintenance procedures 
&gt;&gt;more than anything else. I suggest that if the vehicle was properly 
&gt;&gt;maintained in the first place the failure would simple have not happened 
&gt;&gt;in the first place.
&gt;
&gt;Failures happen, even in the best-maintained vehicles - to believe 
&gt;otherwise is to be ignorant.  I would like to think that the vast majority 
&gt;of the members of this list care enough to properly maintain their busses 
&gt;and minimize (not eliminate) failures.  I can tell you that my battery 
&gt;cables are all clean and did not contribute to regulator failure.

By definition, the purpose of maintenance is to prevent failure. If 
maintenance is not adequate to prevent failure, it is inadequate 
maintenance. If maintenance is adequate, there is no failure. Again, by 
definition, from Engineering 101.

Now go one step further. Study the wiring diagrams. Key on all wires 
leading to/from the regulator. Trace all circuit and verify clean and tight 
everywhere. Look for evidence of heat stress. The culprits will scream at 
you when you learn to recognize the evidence. A hand glass and good light 
is essential. A lot of this evidence is not apparent to the unaided eye. 
That's why so many miss it and end up with re-do. Corrosion is easy, a 
cracked solder joint is not. It requires more 
time/knowledge/skill/experience to find.
