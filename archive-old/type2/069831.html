Subject: Post trip repairs (71 Westy)

Hi folks,

After returning safely home from our long journey a week ago I decided to
park the bus for a week (time off for good behavior).  We covered over 3,400
miles on the trip and for the first time in this engine's 60k mile history I
didn't adjust the valves at or before 3k (call the VW tuneup police!).
Turned out the valves were dead on and needed no adjustment (typical).  I'll
mention a couple repairs/adjustments I made this weekend, FYI.

The choke had been sticking open prior to the trip and I decided to address
the problem this weekend.  I removed the top half of the carb (Brazilian 30
Pict 3) and noticed that one of the thin brass washers that is supposed to
be on either side of the butterfly valve shaft was missing and the valve had
machined a little groove in the aluminum (the groove is above the valve and
shaft when closed).  I filed off the high spot with a miniature electronics
file so that the valve cleared ok and would close completely, but the shaft
itself was binding even after a generous dose of carb cleaner.  I removed
the two screws holding the shaft (in the process one sheared off in the
shaft--ended up drilling it out) and cleaned the parts with carb cleaner
(which still didn't correct the binding, though the shaft appeared straight)
and lightly went over the shaft with some fine steel wool (which corrected
the binding and hopefully didn't remove enough material to cause a
noticeable vacuum leak situation--I doubt it will). 

Now the shaft wasn't binding, but there was only one screw to hold the valve
in place.  The fine female threads on the shaft were ruined from drilling
out the other screw, so I decided to use gas resistant epoxy to plug the
hole and secure the other side of the valve.  This seems to work well--we'll
see if it's a long lasting repair (If anyone has just reason to believe due
to incompatible thermal expansion rates or any personal catastrophy stories,
etc. why this epoxy and this metal shaft should not be joined, speak now or
forever hold your pieces!).

Another occasional &quot;sticky&quot; problem has been the advance plate on my stock
(70 bug) vacuum advance distributor.  I disassembled the distributor and
cleaned it well and lubed the contact surfaces with a drop of motor oil as
per Bentley.  The only snag I encountered were the 2 fiber washer shaped
gaskets that go under the shims on either end of the distributor shaft.
Mine were very brittle and disintegrated into chips as I removed the shims
and shaft.  These washer-gaskets are indented it would appear to reduce
surface area where it contacts the shim, I'm guessing, so that the shim can
move freely if necessary and not rest in one place and get machined by the
rotating shaft.  Rather than pay a visit to the local ignition parts shop on
monday, I decided to make gaskets out of black fiber gasket material which
appears to be the same thickness as the original washers.  These took a
little time to make carefully with an exacto knife, but they fit well and
the shaft spins freely and the advance plate moves like butta.  Again, we'll
see if these washer gaskets work as a good long term fix.

With everything assembled and new points, cond, etc. installed, I was eager
start the van up and start driving it again (definitely feeling bus
withdrawal symptoms over the past week).  To my surprise, the engine
wouldn't turn over---no click no nuttin'.  So I checked my wiring (so
comfortably simple to do on a '71...ahhhh!).  Then I checked the battery
voltage---7.3 volts??!!  I didn't have any startup problems on the trip and
I don't suspect a short though I suppose one could be lurking.  I checked my
log and as of this month the battery is exactly 60 months and over 60,000
miles old (coincidentally, the limit of the warranty!).  I pulled the
battery out and popped off the covers--the plates have a lot of white
oxidation on them.  It's curious how the battery performed well over all
those recent miles of constant driving and restarting and letting it sit for
a week after that made it cash in its chips.  Is it possible all the
constant running over a short period (the tag team driving for all those
miles) and subsequent no use this past week shocked the poor old battery to
death? (sob sob).  I plan to get a new battery tonight since that nasty
oxidation around the lead plates has me believing this battery is history.

It's nice to be working on the bus again and nice to know that it took us
where we had to go and waited for its repairs like a good bus.  In the words
of that farmer in &quot;Babe&quot;, &quot;That'll do, bus, that'll do!!&quot;.
