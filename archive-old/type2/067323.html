Subject: Re: Drag coefficient &amp; buses

&gt;actual drag itself is quite large.  In order to lower the gross or actual
&gt;drag yet retain the interior volume you would have to use a shape such as
&gt;found on, for example, the Toyota Previa wagon or similar.

Ick!  If busses were shaped like Previas, even with the charm they pick up
in other areas, oh, I'm afraid they would not be the wonderful bus they are
today.  The shape is what makes them lovable!  I sure wouldn't have wanted
one so badly if they resembled a spaceship like the modern Silhouettes,
Previas, Windstars, Caravans, Odysseys, etc.  Even the Eurovan is getting a
little too 'streamlined' in its appearance for me...
