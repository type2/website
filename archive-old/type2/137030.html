Subject: Re: [T2] MSquirt in an upright?

Again, all you'd need is a throttle body and a throttle body injector. 
You could possibly use the car as the throttle body and weld in an 
injector somewhere.

Then if you only used one injector, the fuel loop would be easier to 
manage.  I think there are also fuel pumps that can regulate the 
pressure.. but that's only a guess.

&gt; Craig,
&gt; 
&gt; The most important part is going to be how to run the overpressure
&gt; gas from the fuel ring back into the gas tank.
&gt; 
&gt; Otherwise, the biggest will be getting the appropriate fi 
&gt; parts...especially the intake manifolds and wiring.
