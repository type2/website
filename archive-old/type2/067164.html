Subject: Bugs in game show

I was flipping through the channels tonight and caught a glimpse of a 
familiar shape.  I tuned in and watched a show called &quot;Family Challenge&quot; 
on the Family Channel.  They had three bugs parked side by side, lining 
up the windows.  They had them filled with various taste treats, one with 
popcorn, one with nachos, etc..  The family had to shimmy their way 
through each window and successive bug, getting covered in the stuff.
The cars were in great condition, too (at least the OUTSIDE :0)
just more vw's in the media...
