&gt;Also...what is the deal on Warming up
&gt;the engine...I have been following Muir's 3 minute idle warm up...is it a
&gt;waste of time?

Remember that Muir preferred to disconnect his automatic choke and wire it open.
This may be why he was in the habit of letting his vw warm up for the time it
took him to roll a cigarette. If you wire your choke open, it might make sense
to warm it up for a few minutes before you take off, if only to prevent it from
coughing and misfiring. I prefered to put it in 2nd and let the RPM run slightly
high
as I drove the first few blocks in 2nd.
