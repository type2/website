Subject: RE: [T2] Is my alternator toast?

This happened on my Jeep. A new battery fixed the problem after going
through two new alternators.

J

I replaced both the alt and the VR last night, and the battery and EGR 
lights still flicker increasingly faster as the engine turns faster.  
I'll borrow the battery from the honda tonight and see what that does.  
Any other ideas?
