Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Window scrapers.

The aftermarket replacements come with aluminum clips that deform and stay 
deformed...

I modified some nylon generic GM door panel snaps to do the job (came with 
a large round head, I used my Sears' &quot;As seen on TV&quot; clippers and cut two 
sides off of them, making them more like a 'T'.

The had a much more positive lock.

I was really disappointed in the aluminum clips. The aluminum window trim 
and scrapers were purchased from WCM. Aside from the clips all else was 
pretty good.

The OEM clips were spring metal (steel).



Ciao!
