Subject: Re: [T2] Johnny Lightning buses

Whoa, a bus monopoly piece?  That is too cool!!!  I wonder if, being a &quot;thrifty&quot; vehicle it would have a better-than-average chance of landing on Free Parking?  :)

Has anyone actually seen these for sale?  That would be a great addition to a vintage monopoly game (I still remember getting monopoly from three different people one Christmas back in the early 70's).

&gt;Takes forever to load, but it's neat.  Though I doubt that the last one on
&gt;the page really belongs there. :O)
