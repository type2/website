&gt; Can one cylinder be made in-operative?

yes

&gt; I know Vw engine have been made to run on 2 cylinders......

but it was rebalanced etc
&gt; 
&gt; I have a  2.0L fuel inj. hydraulic lifter engine in a '76 Camper here,,, he
&gt; wants to drive it a few thousand miles before he drops the engine to repair it.
&gt; 
&gt; So, I thought I'd ask the list for positive comments about disabling one
&gt; cylinder

I once had to disable one cyl when I blew a spark plug, I removed the
plug, pulled the FI wire and the entire wire from dizzy to plug.

BUT!

I only had to nurse it about 2 miles to get it home and I put on a new
head when I got there.

&gt; but I have personal experience that says it is possible to drive a few thousand
&gt; miles home to a place you can repair it and save money, and time.  

how much of a rebuild are you going to do???  a whole engine rebuild,
don't mind if you do other damage, possibly pounding the bearings etc.  I
never drove over maybe 1200rpm  are you willing to drive a few thousand
miles at 15mph??

If you plan on reusing that engine without a total stripdown  rebuild I
would encourage you to get a trailer and tow it home.

YMMV
