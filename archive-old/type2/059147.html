Subject: Engine Seal...... stupid question
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

hey volks,

I just got back from my first VW meet and I purchased an engine seal for my
'78 kombi, I'm just confused about one thing... on the seal (It's foam), one
side is shiny and solid while the other side is rough and uncoated... does it
matter which side I install the engine seal... My dad thought since part of
the seal will be hit by road grime etc. that I should put the shiny coated
side on the outside facing the road... I have no idea though, I don't know if
it's important or not.... If someone can help me with my problem, I will be
very grateful

-Thanks
