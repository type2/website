Subject: 82 Vanagon wheel bearing fixup
Message-Id: &lt;199910020358.WAA10289_at_mail1.centuryinter_dot_net&gt;

I had my aircooled 82 Westie up on jack stands working on the exhaust and
noticed that the passenger-side rear wheel turned less freely than the
driver's side wheel. Closer inspection reveals a sort-of grinding sound at
some points in wheel rotation. So, I figured that the right rear wheel
bearings were going bad and needed a replacement.

So, in anticipation of the job, I studied up using Haynes and Bentley
manuals. It looks like a fairly big job. I ordered, from &quot;J.C. Whipme&quot;
(Whitney),  a 2 foot 3/4&quot; drive breaker bar to get the castellated nut off
and it finally arrived today. I affixed this huge piece of heavy steel bar
onto the big old 46 mm socket and attacked the castellated nut with
gusto... finally getting atop the bar with both feet and jumping up and
down: only to find that I had bent the BREAKER BAR but the castellated nut
was still just sitting there laughing at me while it casually smoked a
cigarette. Infuriated, I snatched up my can of WD40 and liberally doused
the evil castellated nut and once again attacked it with great force after
flipping the breaker bar the other way. Well, that straightened out the
breaker bar. Meanwhile the evil castellated nut was getting out its
sunglasses, rather enjoying the nice warm day and the suntan oil I had just
doused it with. 

So, my question to the list: What should I do here? Should I go to a brake
shop and see if they can bust the axle nut loose using pneumatic impact
wrenches? Or perhaps order one of those special tools from J.C. Whitney
that are supposed to be used with a hammer and a 1/2&quot; breaker bar? Or
should I go to Wally Mart and get a propane torch and cook the axle nut and
then try to wrest it off using the El Cheapo breaker bar? I'm open to
suggestions.
