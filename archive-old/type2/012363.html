To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

hi everyone,

i wanted to say a big thank you for all the advice and
support given to me in my quest for my first bus.  i
also wanted to report that i am the proud new owner of
a &quot;baby blue&quot; 1975 VW standard bus. it's body is in
great shape and runs like a champ. the interior is in
good shape and there is hardly any rocker or floor
rust.  

if anyone has patterns for seat covers i would love to
get them from you. i'm ready to add my own personal
touch:).

once again big thank you for all the members who gave
me advice and check out thesamba_dot_com for a pic.

have a nice day,
tesa
