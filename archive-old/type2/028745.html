Subject: SCRATCH-&amp;-DENT '72-74 German Heat Exchangers (1 pair only)

I have one pair (left and right) of brand new '72-74 genuine Volkswagen
German-made heat exchangers for sale, AS-IS.

On one, the connection at the front (to the heater control box) is pretty
badly mangled thanks to UPS.  It could be straightened with a pair of
pliers, and probably made fully-functional, but would never look perfect
(therefore I cannot sell it as new). On the other heat exchanger, the unit
looks fine to the eye, but a customer returned it saying that his mechanic
claimed it would not line up properly to his cylinder head.  Both have minor
scratches, dings, and dents, but nothing of any importance other than the
above.

Price is $199.95 for the PAIR, plus shipping ($18 east of the Mississippi,
$30 west), as-is, no returns.  This is roughly half price.

These will not be on the website, and at this point no one at the shop even
knows about this email yet. First person who p-mails me gets them.
