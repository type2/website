Subject: Cylinder #1 woes

Well as per my previous post, I have a dead number one cylinder.  I have
'73 bus with dual carbs(solex PDSITs) and dual vacuum advance dizzy.  The
numbe one cylinder (front passenger, FIF) won't fire except eratically,
usually not at all.  I can pull that wire during running and the RPMs
don't drop at all.  All the other cylinders seem to work fine.  It starts
easy and runs rough.

I have been through the electrical system back and forward.  Replace the
cap, the spark plug(twice).  I even pulled the wire while it was runing
and got a 2.5&quot; blue spark from the spark plug end of the wire.  I swapped
plugs with another cylinder and sam result.  I have it timed at 7.5, not
sure if BTDC or ATDC but its on the left hand side of the scale with 0 at
the very top.  Could timing cause all the other cylinders to run smooth
and not the number one?  I know it is getting gas because the plug smells
like gas when I pull it, and the other cylinder on that side is getting
plenty of gas.

My current list of things people have said are:
exhaust leak
vacuum leak
bad plug (already checked)
stuck or messed valve (need compression check)

Weirdness: if I pull the number one wire from the dizzy and let the spark
arc from the dizzy to the wire about 1 inch away the engine speeds up
but when I reintall the wire it slows down again.
