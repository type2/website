Subject: Like new '76 westy f/s

I have been enjoying a perfectly original, like new Westy for the last
couple of summers.

Green of course!  Perfect orginal Plaid interior.  Nice cabinetry, fridge,
stove...

Mosquito net, all the bells and whistles.

Almost new tires

I bought it from an old man who had taken care of it.

Time to pay the kids school tuition.

$4800

Not a dot of RUST.
