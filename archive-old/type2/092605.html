Subject: Re: [T2] poptop seal ??

Here's the risk. Without the seal and driving at speed, air can get under 
the top and lift it, and in the worst case, tear it right off, the whole 
top ending up in someone's windshield. If you will be just running around 
town at 25, not too much risk. But if you have to travel at 55+, just a bit 
risky.

&gt;Hi.  The poptop seal on my 78 westfalia has gone bad.  I have ordered a 
&gt;new one and it is due in next week or the following.  My question is....
&gt;
&gt;Can I safely take the seal off and leave it without one for a week or so?
