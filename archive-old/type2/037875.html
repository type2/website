Now THAT is a very cool idea. Simple, elegant and virtually undiagnosable
during a theft.  You might even get simpler by pulling the rotor button and
carrying it with you.  Could cranking the engine with no button damage the
points/regulator/coil/alt/gen?

Wierd theft story:

A friend i know had a nice 69 westy that became non-functional for whatever
reason.  
He parked it in the parking lot of the subshop he worked at.
The van was completely immobile - would not start.  
It sat there for several months until one day he came to work and it was gone
- just plain-old 'gone'. It had never been 'stickered' or anything.

He checked with everyone; boss, cops, landowner, family, friends etc -
nothing.

Somebody had to have hooked onto it and towed it off!

Pretty easy to do i guess - how not-wierd is it to see someone towing a VW
bus?

Some people, man.

Our logic was this:  Someone who wanted a bus because it is a bus probably
wouldn't steal one, but someone who wanted to hack it and transfer the
engine/transaxle to a r_at_ilbuggy might.

I don't mean to offend, but lets hear it for the buggyrunners giving
themselves a bad name...as if just being a buggyrunner isn't enough...

Remember that Adam12 episode where the dudes stole the engine out of a
beetle?

sorry for friday-like post,

clark
