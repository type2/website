Subject: 2 Liter, rebuilt, compression problems.

Volks,

Here's my situation:

AVP rebuilt 2 liter in 77 bus. All stock - dizzy, FI, etc.

**** At 0 miles *****
Compression test on fresh rebuild (cold)
1 - 115    2 - 125    3 - 135    4 - 125

**** At 300 miles ****
Changed oil/filter and adjusted valves. Only a couple needed to be tweeked
perhaps .002.

**** At 1000 miles
Adjusted valves. Again, only a couple valves needed to be tweeked perhaps
.002 inches. Then I did another compression test (again cold):
1 - 95    2 - 140    3 - 125    4 - 80

This looks pretty bad. I squirted about 5 pumps of oil from an oil can into
number 4 - result changed to perhaps 85 psi. Sounds like valve problem. Also
all plugs were whiter that I would like.

Engine runs great - plenty of power and no pinging. Timer is at 7 degrees
BTDC with total advance at about 35 degrees BTDC. Idles fine - firing on all
4 (per the test of pulling plug wires one by one).

So I'd say I must be running lean when running under load and I burned my
bloody valves! Is it possible to burn valves so quickly? Any comments on a
course of action? I'm thinking that I'll check fuel pressure and fuel
pressure regulator next - and then I suppose look into an AFM adjustment.

Any comments or insight is greatly appreciated.
