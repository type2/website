Gary:

I'm standing here looking (not literally) looking at the engine from
my '81 van, on which I've just installed new motor mounts.  I don't
know what you mean by clearance between the oil filler tube and the
support being &quot;minimal&quot;; there's only about a 1/4&quot; between the two
on my motor, and I'll bet that shrinks once the weight of the engine
is supported by the mounts.

I would think you could work on the mounts without removing the engine.
I would loosen the trans carrier bolt, support the engine with a jack,
remove the bolts between the carrier and the chassis (first supporting
the engine with a jack) and then lower the engine/trany enough to get
to the mount bolts.

&gt; I  am having a problem on my new'82 and believe it's the motor mounts.
The oil fill tube runs 
&gt; just above the the engine support that the 4 motor mounts attach to.
The clearance between tube 
&gt; and the support is minimal and I suspect that the engine has settled.
Anyone know how much 
&gt; clearance there should be? Is it really necessary to drop the engine?
Any suggestions would be 
&gt; appreciated.
