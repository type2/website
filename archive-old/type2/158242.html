&gt; Also, is this a common high mileage wear issue or
&gt; is the cause more like the silly door hinge that
&gt; was once used to repair accelerator pedal?

My brass strap hinge is now in its 5th or 6th
year and despite the fact that it's over a hundred
years old seems to be doing quite well...Thank
