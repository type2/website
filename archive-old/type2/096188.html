&gt; Ok so I need to check my shifter's alignment?  Because since I'm not sure how to do that I'll have to ask another couple of local VW gurus to help so I need to know what to tell them we need to do...thanks for the help.  BTW these guys have a bug and a square back, so are the transaxels the same or similar?

the bug shifter adjustment is similar. but get the Bentley manual
