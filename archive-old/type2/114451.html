Subject: dash vents

Anyone have a good source for the round vent/louver  found in the dash.  
My louvers are broken and the closing mechanisms only stay open if you 
turn the vent to angle it so that gravity keeps it open.  I thought I 
saw someone had them in a catalogue a few years ago but cannot find them 
now.  Any help would be appreciated.
