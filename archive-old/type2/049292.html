Subject: [T2] ebrake cable Q

Have an off-the-wall ebrake question... we had a thread here lately that
dealt with what cables went on what years, and I have a variant:
my 70 has a 72 suspension (front disks, rear axles and backing plates from
a 72) BUT still has the 70 ebrake cables. If I remember right, it has the
70 ebrake hardware. Now, the 72 cable is about 5 cm shorter than the 70
(and is put together differently)  which I believe is why I kept the 70
cable. However, the swap put my ebrake cable right at the ends of the
adjustment screws. They hold, but not enough to make me happy. And there
certainly is no room for further wear adjustments; the adjuster nuts are
right down at the end of the threads.

So my question: since the cables are (possibly) at the end of the
adjustment because of the difference in the way the 70 and 72 assemblies
worked, should I TRY the 72 cables? OR, can I use washers,etc to allow the
adjuster nuts to ride further up the threads, thus allowing further
tightening? I know that method is a nono if the cable has stretched/shoes
are worn, but I think my horse is of a different color...

I hope this made sense; if not, pmail me and I will try and srtaighten us
BOTH out :)
