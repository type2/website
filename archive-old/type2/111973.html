Subject: pics of new/rebuilt 2.0 not FI ?

well i am looking for something to go by when tearing down my engine and putting back together again..?

need to make sure that i have all my tin and also that everything looks like it is suppose to..

maybe this sounds silly but i am the kind of mechanic that has to look at things first and then i know how it works and how to fix it..!

i also draw the smae way ..most can draw a pic off the top of there head but i have to look at a pic to be able to draw it ..
same thing...

btw this can be a diagram like they have on bus boys on there parts or a origianl color pic... or both will be fine.. or can someone just point me to the right link so i can print it out and hang it on the wall in my building where the engine is being dismantled.

anyways anyone help with this..
thanks in advance 
peace
