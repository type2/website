Subject: [T2] 1700cc engine rebuild parts for sale!!!

...and if you are building a 1700, I have many of the parts David doesn't :)

I have a reground crank (I have to check the + number), rebuilt heads , nos
connecting rods, nos p/cs... basically, a WHOLE engine!
My friend Scott ended up moving to LA before he got to his rebuild, and
gave me all the stuff. I was going to put it in a Bus at some point, but
finances are rearing their unpretty head, and I am looking to unload.
I have a case,  carb and tin, as well.
I am in Austin TX.

Tell me what you need, ask questions, make an offer - let David and I help
you get back on the road!
