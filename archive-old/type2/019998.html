&gt; I queried Coleman about their claim that these heaters are OK in enclosed
&gt; spaces.  Their e-mail reply said they recommended an opening of at least 6
&gt; sq. in. for ventilation.  That's a hole only 2&quot;X3&quot;, and I'd personally be
&gt; pretty leery about sleeping with one of these heaters going and only that
&gt; tiny bit of ventilation.

I bought one of these on my way to florida last spring, because I couldn't feel
my legs or see out the window.  It wasn't really as effective as I wanted for
going down the road.  I think for that, I'd have two.

    As far as sleeping with them on, well, I cracked the passenger door window
open about two inches.  I also put the curtain up.  The heater was between the
front seats, facing rearward.  The pop top was also open.  I did this at least
three nights of my camping trip.  I didn't die.  I felt it heated the bus
nicely, and was very comfortable.  I don't know how long it stayed on for, but
the tank was empty by morning.

    I like my heater very much, and I'm not afraid to sleep with it on.  Just
crack the window (I always do more than six inches, either a vent window, or a
front door window).

Plans to buy another bus are on hold, until next summer
when I will somehow have enough money to go to CA and buy one.
