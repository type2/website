Subject: [T2] RE: turbo on TypeII

Justin Said:
 
Anyone here done this?  Know of any web sites or books that might have some
info on this?  I am curious and have a small turbo laying around my garage :
)

I say:

Justin, I know of a couple and both were built locally to me (Sydney
Australia) The company that built them is called Hellbug Engineering and the
website is http://www.hellbug_dot_com.au I don't know how much help they'll be
but I know that one turbo motor was in a Bus and it flew, the other was in a
type 3 notch.  There's a picture of that on my Wild VW website at
http://www.geocities_dot_com/monsterbus 

I can recommend Hellbug, they built the first transaxle to last in my bus
with the V8 engine.

Cheers
Steve
