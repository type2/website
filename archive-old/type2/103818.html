&gt;     has anyone had any experience with these vehicle wrapping companies that

&gt;     I am considering this for my bus. After all, she gets plenty of looks
&gt; w/o any flashy vinyl ad on it and I wouldn't mind an extra $400 a month.

I looked into it out of curiosity, they have a lot of restrictions, and
put a GPS recorder in your vehicle.  you also have no say in the ads they
put on your vehicle, except to be able to refuse alcohol and tobbaco ads

hassles weren't worth the $$$  IMO

YMMV
