Subject: '81 Vanagon cheap!

I've got a '81 7-pass Vanagon I'll let go for $300. Good body (minor
rust around a couple windows, dent in left rear corner), good interior,
glass, tires. Factory air and gas heater. I just pulled the engine and
all related FI stuff. 
   If I can't sell it by 9/1, I'll pull the tranny and CV joints and
send it to the junkyard. 
    It's in Mobile, AL   (334-478-7855)
