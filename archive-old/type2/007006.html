 Hi, I'm a newbie to the list and a lurker but I figured I'd jump in when poor
David cried:

&lt;tried a few more times, and it would either start and die, or, if the
throttle was touched, explode.  Latest time blew the AFM off (not clamped
tight), as well as all the other lines.

any ides????&gt;
Well you seem to be going down the right path and I *don't* know what simple
checks you have done. However,  when a FI bus started acting up like this I
normally found that the head temperature sensor was the culprit. It did not
take long before corrosion would form on the threads and the resistace to
ground would go sky high...( I remember one 76 *in* 76!) one would *think*
that this would flood the thing as the higher resistance gives greater
enrichment, but the computer will see this as an &quot;open&quot; and shut it down. I
still have the 2500 ohm resistor with the clip leads that I would substitute
for the head sensor...see if you can squirch the sensor back and forth with a
socket to break up the corrosion (Snap-On made a socket for these sensors..but
I think I bought the last one they had in 1980....) OK..you checked that,
maybe. You have fuel pressure? I see that you are checking the pump contacts
and such..have you installed a pressure gauge to monitor the ring main
pressure? a simple 0-30 psig water pressure gauge with a length of fuel line
and two clamps does the trick. (Before anybody flames me, the *nominal*
RUNNING fuel pressure on these systems is about 28-32 psig..the gauge will
take that without a problem..when you put it under load the fuel pressure goes
up in response to the increased manifold pressure..so don't install this
little gauge for &quot;keeps&quot;)  The number one cause of FI bus (and 411's
squarebacks and 914's) failure to run properly was the points......even on the
electronic ignition vanagons, a faulty ground on the hall sensor harness will
do this...
If she's backfiring hard enough to blow off the hoses,she's lean....
If it will idle, I'd let it idle.....see how long it will run..yes, the
lifters may have collapsed..the oil light is out?...You have no history of bad
rods in this rig?...take the chance and let it run... if it idles for a few
minutes, it's not the fuel pump etc...(you will have to go *drive* it to get
the pesky tapping gone)..
I wish I knew what you had checked already...Most of these took me less than
an hour to fix..except on my own Syncro Westy...4 hours on the side of the
interstate in the snow...Isn't  that *always* the case?
