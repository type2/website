Subject: Re: [T2] Merry Christmas &amp; Happy Holidays

&gt;&gt; Merry Christmas and HapyHolidays to all my Bus friends!!
&gt;
&gt; hope your holidays are full of Busma

How my father and I spent Christmas Day:

All this to find this $*%&amp;*! spring:

http://scrounge.bradway_dot_net/gallery/album04/aan

Notice that it's a little mangled. It came out of the crankcase this way. So
the ultimate answer is that if you drop the distributor shaft spring into the
little hole in the case, you better get ready to split the engine! I turned
the engine once forward by hand and numerous times backwards by hand. Where
the spring finally came to reset was not visible through any external access
point. It finally came out when we were trying to get the #4 piston off so we
could complete split the halves.

On the postive side - it is possible to split the halves enough to get the
spring out by removing only the 3&amp;4 head and jugs. Getting to the $#%_at_ case
bolt nut on the bottom side between 1&amp;2 is close to impossible and might
warrant taking the head off the other side as well.

If I didn't know that the engine was tore down and rebuilt 18K miles ago, this
would probably be a welcomed chance to rebuild. Instead, it was an unnecessary
tear-down due to a stupid mistake!

My father doesn't like the 'dumb book with the silly pictures' (Muir guide)
but if he had been following Muir's instructions on how to seat the
distributor spring using a length of coat-hanger, we would have been able to
spend the day with the rest of the family!

-Eric
