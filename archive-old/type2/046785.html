 Hi,

Alex writes:
&gt; I am in the market for a Westfalia camper. I was wondering what the
difference is in 
&gt; horsepower, between a 1982 Vanagon aircooled, and a 1989 Vanagon
watercooled. Which
&gt;  one has a better reliability record??

 It's probably true to say that the '82 has a better record. The aircooled
setup is 
simpler and generally better understood. OTOH you're asking the aircooled
side of
the audience- talk to the vanagon folks for a balanced view!

&gt; Is the 1982 Vanagon engine exactly the same as the 1979 bus engine??

 No, it has a few mechanical differences which can make finding some parts a
bit
harder. Fundamentally, it's very similar and has essentially the same
output.

&gt; If it is, then isn't the 1979 bus lighter in weight than the 1982
Vanagon??

 Yes, it is lighter and has smaller frontal area, so will be &quot;faster&quot;.

 OTOH the vanagon has better suspension, more space and will obviously be a
little
newer. They are more &quot;civilised&quot; cars: easier to drive, quieter etc. but
lack the
classic style of a baywindow.

&gt; I need it to be able to go up hills without a problem. Thanks in
advance.....

 The '79 will probably climb slightly better, once its been loaded up with
friends,
family, gear, dogs, beer etc it won't make much difference, though!

 The later vanagon will be more powerful and quieter, but is likely to be
more 
expensive to maintain. One thing to note is that the watercooled boxer
engine
was only ever used in the VW bus, so some parts are hard to find (and
pricey).

 IMHO, the right generation of bus for you is a matter of finding your own
balance between running costs, &quot;style&quot; and driveability. The splits are
coolest,
but slower and noisier, bays are faster and have better road manners,
vanagons
continue the evolution. The upright engines are relatively inexpensive,
pancake
parts more pricey and watercooled ones more expensive yet. This gives you
quite
a few options, if you take the crossover years into account:

 Early split
 Split
 Upright engined bay
 Pancake engined bay
 Pancake engined vanagon
 Diesel vanagon (and TD?)
 Watercooled vanagon (1.9 or 2.1)

  For reliability &amp; hillclimbing I'd probably look for a pancake engined 
baywindow, but I'd keep my eyes open for a turbodiesel vanagon while I
was hunting. If I was comfortable with the maintenance costs and didn't
care too much about classical appeal, I'd consider a 2.1 waterboxer...but
don't tell the guys on the type2 list!! :-)

Cheers,
	  W.
