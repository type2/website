&gt; With my '68 w/1600 engine, I generally drove with the pedal to the

&gt; along at 50, a more reasonable speed (3/4 throttle is best, eh?).

My '71 with stock 1600DP cruises nicely at 62MPH (actual) on the flat
at about half-throttle.  Were the SP engines really that much less
powerful?

I try to never run my bus wide open except during acceleration.  The
only exception I can think of was a trip with a stiff headwind where I
was at WOT and only making 50-55MPH (actual).  VW said you can: &quot;Top
speed is cruising speed&quot;, but I'm a bit more conservative.

One factor that will really muddy the waters here is the inaccuracy of
speedometers.  Mine reads 75MPH when my actual speed is 62, according
to the GPS.  The cruising speed values you get in this informal survey
will be suspect unless those who respond have calculated correction
factors for their speedometers or are gadget freaks like I.

PS:  On page 5 of Saturday's LA Times there was an article about the
shaky Brazilian economy.  In the article was a picture of new, unsold
VW breadloaf type 2's in storage.  The picture was small, but there
were hundreds of buses visible, including a couple of singlecabs and a
doublecab!
