It IS a pressed-in plug. It's in the end of the main oil gallery.  There's
another one just like it behind the flywheel.  The one behind the flywheel is
the one that typically pops out at around 150k miles.  If your going to take
out the motor, do both of them.  If your anal about it do all of them! 

To fix it so it never leaks again, you need to remove it, (drill a small hole
in it, insert a sheet metal screw and pull it out) tap the hole and insert a
pipe plug well slathered with loc-tite 571.  If interference with the fan
housing might be a problem, you'll need to either find a flush fitting plug or
make the pipe plug flush fitting.

Welding IS NOT the solution!!!  JB Weld IS NOT the solution!!!

Another thing to check while the fan housing is off is the condition of the
rear motor mounts.  If at all questionable, replace them now.  The fan housing
HAS to come off to get to them. Then NEVER jack the bus up by the motor! It
tears them every time.

&gt; I posted last night and not one person has responded to my questions. I
&gt; have three oil leaks, two of them I have solved and know how to fix. The
&gt; third one goes like this:  Type 4 engine, 1800cc . Take off the fan
&gt; shroud and on the left side of the engine, where the oil filter spin-on
&gt; adaptor attaches to the block, there are two *holes* (I don't know what
&gt; else to call them), each about the size of a dime. It looks like they
&gt; were filled with press-in inserts. See the Bently Manual, section 5, page
&gt; 25 (fig. 9-1) and page 50 (figs. 15-9 and 15-10). Look at page 50 first,
&gt; the *holes* are in the bottom left hand corners of both pictures, and
&gt; looking at page 25 gives you a good idea where they are in reference to
&gt; the rest of the back of the engine. Oil is leaking (quite rapidly) out of
&gt; the uppermost hole. I don't know what this is, why it is leaking, and how
&gt; to fix it. Somebody, please help.
&gt; I don't know if no one read my posting or no one can help.
&gt; I have been thinking about calling in a welder to weld a nice bead over
&gt; the leaking joint, does anyone think this would work? What exactly is the
&gt; type 4 engine block made out of? Magnesium? Aluminum? ...?  If JB Weld
&gt; would seal up the leak, would it handle the range of temperatures on the
&gt; ouside of the block? By the way, the block is NOT cracked.
&gt; My wife and son and I are about to head out on a month long trip in two
&gt; weeks and we can't go unless I fix this. Again, please help me if you
&gt; can.
&gt; Thanks,
