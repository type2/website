Subject: Re: [T2] Seats

&gt; The only other option I am aware
&gt; of is to get yourself a nice set of Vanagon seats and slide em in. They go
&gt; right on a 78' you just have to remove the drivers side left arm rest. In
&gt; your case you may need to unbolt the runners from your old seats and bolt
&gt; them to the Vanagon seats.

No, Vanagon seats will not be a direct swap into his 72. Only 77 and up Westies
have both seat tracks. The passenger seat on 68 to 79 regular buses do not have
any tracks. The pass. seats just hook on. [some 78 and 79 buses with NO
bulkheads have tracks] All the drivers seats have tracks.
