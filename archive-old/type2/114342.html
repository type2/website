Subject: Re: [T2] Interior roofing

Hi James,

The original vinyl headliner is glued at the edges and held up in the 
middle with wire bows. I removed (most of) it from my bus when I 
installed the westfakia pop-top.

The plywood westy headliner is held in place with U-clips at the edges 
and with screws in the middle. The screws are usually hidden in the 
lighting recesses and behind the sun visors.

I also have a 77 sunroof bus at home that has a badly rotted headliner 
thanks to a faulty sunroof drain, and my plan for it involves 
transplanting a wooden headliner from a 73 westy.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Interesting enough I've gotten lots of comments on what I should and 
&gt; shouldn't put up but what I was originally wanting was 'how' the stuff 
&gt; is secured to the roof.   Another thing I noticed about the old van 
&gt; roof is that it gets skinnier near the front and near the back. The 
&gt; middle is wider. Talk about a potential pain to precut something ;)  
&gt; Maybe this weekend between Turkey dinners I will figure something out.
