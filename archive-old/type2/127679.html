Subject: Westy wood panelling resto

Hello, list... After much ado and lengthy periods of time, the reconstruction of my 1973 Westfalia has begun. Mine is the wood panelling and head liner which is the light color. You can see the grain, but there is obviously some pigment to the finish when compared to the backs of the pieces. I removed them from the carport after 2 years and to my relief, they are still usable. They have some places which I've been meaning to take care of, black spots due to leaky window seals, etc. I went down to Lowe's and picked up some wood bleach but don't know what color to stain the wood to match the original. I was hoping to be able to do spot finishes if the match is close enough. But anything is better than the black areas. I have posted a picture of the damage I'm talking about and a close up on the color I'm talking about. They can be viewed here: http://www_dot_cardomain_dot_com/memberpage/136112/9 Ignore the picture at the bottom. 
If anyone can tell me what stain to use to match the original finish or how to do it, please let me know. Thank you very much.                    -Paul Deatherage
