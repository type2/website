Subject: Green Westy Plaid 4 sale

Hello List,

I am gettig married soon and I have to make some money
for the big day. I am forced to sell a treasure that I
collected for the last few years. I have 3 large upper
bunk cushion covers and 4 small upper bunk cushion
covers for the 1976-1979 westies. This is the green,
yellow and black plaid fabric. I have almost completed
taking the seams out of them so the material can be
used for recovering. This is alot of fabric. The
material has been washed and is very bright and stain
free. This fabric is getting pricier and pricier
because the OEM fabric is running out. The going rate
for it is $45 a running yard (3.3ft x5.5ft) I
calculated the value of my fabric and at that rate, it
is worth $408.00!  I am not looking to rip any one
off. I would like $200 for the entire lot. For
pictures, go to thesamba_dot_com. I have listed it there.
under the 68-79 VW Bus Parts. Check it out and let me
know if you are interested. This should be enough
fabric to recover the front seats and the fold out bed
in the back of a Westy. I don't need it for my 68 bus.
Let me know. I hate to get rid of it but I need the
money. Thanks!
