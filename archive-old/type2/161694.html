Subject: Re: [T2] Timing off by 180??

To get the timing back, all you have to do is remove the 'foot' from the 
distributor and turn it 180.  That willl get your rotor pointing in the 
right direction, if that is the only problem.  The real question is, why is 
it off in the first place, was is right before the tune up, is this the way 
you got it, is the bottom of the distributor damaged, has the engine 
recently been rebuilt, ect.
