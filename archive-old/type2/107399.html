Subject: Passed CA Smog! 

Yup, that's right, My 77' Westy Pumpkin II passed CA smog today, a week
before it was due!

He's running a brand-new avp rebuild with about seven miles on it. The lack
of break-in time didn't seem to cause any emissions trouble. The folks at
BRU automotive in the college area of San Diego were pretty helpful.  They
fixed the exhaust stud that I pulled out of the head (I swear I had the
#_at_%$_at_% torque wrench on it!), set the CO, checked the emmissions, and took
it to the smog station. We do have the full EGR setup installed...and of
course it's going to stay installed ;0)

I couldn't stand to take it in myself, due to all the horror stories. I'm
now 2 and 0 on smog, and hoping that I'll only have to do one more before
the rolling exemption catches up. At least I'll have a fresh, clean EGR
system whe the next time comes.

Say, does anybody know how the vote turned out on that CA Senate Bill, the
one that was going to kill the rolling exemption?
