&gt; They are not really all that rare. I've seen a few for sale, although

&gt; Scandinavia is also very good.

I'd agree there.
I've bought several pieces of VW literatureon Ebay that have come from
Europe. Postage on books is insignificant.
A real interesting book I recently got is something called&quot;Genuine parts
illustrated catalogue&quot; typ 2 Mod. 68&gt;79 published 1994 and is apparently
published by VW in an attempt to get individuals to correspond directly
with the factory to purchase spares. There is a factory direct phone
number inside to call. The book is basically all the line drawings that
are on dealer microfiches withe the key numbers but no part numbers. In
other words a customer decides he needs a certain part and calls in the
key number and the factory ships direct. There is no chance these books
will be much help to the aftermarket parts business as they have no part
numbers on them. Mercedes did the same thing and included a small
edition in the glove box of new cars.
Anyway this book is great just to see how things are supposed to go
together (a great advantage when dealing with vehicles that are 30 years
old and someone may have left off parts or rigged up something in the
meantime!
