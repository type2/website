Subject: [T2] finally picking up my engine from Boston Bob

From T2 archive research, and on-going T2 banter,
Boston Engine and Boston Bob is consistenly at the top
of the Engine rebuild quality list.  Here in a year or
two, I will need to `replace` my bottom end, and I
think I will go to Boston Bob.  I already have a
second &quot;GE&quot; engine as a trade-in, so as to expedite
the overhaul, and reduce the vehicle down-time.
   
Although I did not own the vehicle for the last
rebuild, I would be embarrased to admit to the T2 list
who did the last rebuild on my 78 ASI/Riviera.  LOL!
