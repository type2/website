So Ross Rankin says:
&gt; 
&gt; David Carment in his 06 Oct 1996 post mentions an archived article by 
&gt; Jack Reid on gas heater installations this was in 1995. What' the best 
&gt; way to locate this article ?

I just happen to have that article in the form of an FAQ that Mr. Reed
sent me.  I'll email it to you now.
