&gt; I wouldn't believe anything I heard 'on the radio'. LA pollution
&gt; levels have been visibly increasing for the five yrs I lived
&gt; there (90-95). They always have said that. Of course it was attri-
&gt; buted to their oxy gas. Wonder what it's doing to our mileage and
&gt; engines.

NOW now now....This is coming very close to a flame and shows that you 
are not aware of all the components that make smog. Smog levels have 
INDEED gone down, but they mostly measure this using Ozone levels. They 
do not include particulate pollution which is what makes up the majority 
of visible pollution. Also, I live in the Pomona Valley, and I have for 
the last four years. I have lived in So CAl for 14 years and I am going 
to disagree with you. Smog was not as bad this year as it was in previous 
years. Particualtes were also lower this summer. The number of days that 
were awful was a lot lower than years past. The new gas does work, 
andalthough it is a pain in the ASS, with gas fires, etc. I feel that it 
is probably a necessary evil.

my 2 cents
