	After two months of pedestrianism in a city not designed for it
(Houston), my 74 hardtop is back on the road today.It had been doing lots
of farting on deceleration, fouling plugs like crazy,
overheating/vaporlocking, and generally being pissy. After trying to sync
the carbs and troubleshoot other areas, local minor Yoda Brian Lanahan
noted the arms on both carbs were jiggly, and, short of an amazing machine
job, would probably never fly exactly right again.
	On top of this, my engine compartment was a complete mess of wires
and hoses. It's utter complete stock California (1800), EGR filter, smog pump,
vacuum advance, the whole bit. Forgive me, list, I yanked it off, all of
it. It's sitting in boxes in my apartment, awaiting the day I buy a new
set of dual carbs and EGR filter and try to go back to stock, which is
probably sometime after I get the basic concepts of carburation down. 
	In its place went a Weber progressive. There's a bevy of pipes
coming out of the heads (cylinders 1, 2, &amp; 3, but not 4, curiously) that
lead into the smog pump to get redirected into the air filter, and thence
the dual carbs, that get in the way of the new progressive linkage. The
pipes have to come off, but we found that 3/8 inch brass &quot;flare plugs&quot;
&gt;from a local plumbing supply shop exactly fit the threads of the holes in
the heads left behind when we removed the 19 mm (?) nuts that held on the
smog pump pipes. We gently torqued them on with a little silicone sealer
and they don't seem to leak any, and we're pretty psyched about that. 
	Another modification that bears mentioning is the swapping of the
carb to face backwards, to make adjustment super easy. Lanahan's been
machining arms to connect the throttle cable, but we found a funky
adjustable arm at the local VW parts supplier that worked nicely. 
	We stuck in a 009, which will get replaced by an 050 in a couple
of weeks. The engine runs real cool and stalls a lot, but it's nothing a
flathead screwdriver can't fix. I'm all excited. I understand the
progressives are bitchy, but is there anything particularly nasty I should
know about them?

	Cheers and motoring again,

	Ian
