It looks like this will fit into the radio cavity on a 1970 bus.

I checked one for physical fit, and except for the rectangular hole
needing to be increased to the DIN dimension, all else will go, from
what I can determine. Even the bezel will fit in the cavity recess.

Having one of these jewels might very well be one of those totally cool
experiences after installation.
Anybody out there know of anyone, anywhere, that has one of these?
