Subject: Re: [T2] Brakes squeal after 15 mins.

&lt;&lt; I eliminated all the suspects with my squealing brakes and I believe the
flexible brake hoses have deteriorated.  It wasn't a problem with my old
rotors and pads but the clearances with the new parts revealed a problem
with the hose.

What brand should I be shopping for?

Got money? Airoquip...Stainless braided...Buy it once...
