Subject: Re: [T2] 78 2.0L

And let's say that you get in an accident and the fuel line gets cut,
there is a fire, and your ignition is on!  That is NOT a good scenario!

In the 78, there is a switch in the AFM and I believe the double relay
provides power during cranking.  If the engine stops, the AFM flap
closes and the pump turns off.

&gt; Karl,
&gt; My friends 79 runs up to pressure when the ignition is turned on, and
&gt; shuts off when that pressure is met.
&gt; 
&gt; My Vanagon does the same thing---is a 78 that much different?

&gt; WHOA!!
&gt; Doing this ''test'' will lead you to THINK you have a pump/filter
&gt; problem when you DON'T!
&gt; The pump is NOT designed to run when you turn the key on. It only runs
&gt; when you are cranking the engine or the engine is running.
&gt; If it runs on YOUR bus with just the key on, YOU have a problem. Go back
&gt; to the Bentley, the answer will be there.
