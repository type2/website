Subject: me and VW in traffic court

Today I was in traffic court. What fun.

I got pulled over a few weeks ago in my 1972 Westfalia Bus.
The Bus has a stock 1979 2 Liter fuel injection engine (california
setup) and an automatic transmission.

So the drivetrain is bone stock 1979.

This car does 75 mph on a good day. I have never had it above that,
eventhough I've tried.

According to the cop I did 80mph on an interstate on-ramp, excellerating
from slow stop-and-go traffic up a hill.
Actually I did 65 mph.

So I figure I go to court.

So I show the judge the owners manual of a 79 Bus. Top speed 75mph.

So I show the judge the Bus sales brochure. Top speed 75 mph.

So I show the judge the receipt from the purchase of the STOCK engine.

So the cop says I did 80, going uphill and excellerating from
stop-and-go traffic 300 yards before. The cop lies and doesn't even
blink. Cop says his speedo is calibrated.

So the judge says:

&quot;I have a VW Karmann Ghia. And that thing is also faster than what it
says in the manual.&quot;

I try to explain the difference between carburators and Fuel injection.

He does not believe me.

He and the cop refuse to test drive my Bus.

I have to go to traffic school now and am out of $102.

Now I believe all those cliches about law enforcement in Alabama.



Pissed and innocent,

Martin Peitz
