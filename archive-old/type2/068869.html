Subject: CDI Modules

To All:

My articles about capacitive discharge ignition modules, archived by Mr.
Richard Kurtz on his web site (the address of which I've lost again due to
another system crash) generates a fairly consistant stream of messages.   The
questions most commonly asked have to do with the following:

I do not work for Universal Corporation nor do I have any arrangement with
them.  I recommend their product because it has worked reliably for me in
more than a hundred installations.

My recommendation is not based on any formal, quantified product-testing
program.  I've used a number of other electronic ignition systems but MSD is
the only brand-name I can recall.  The CDI module from Universal proved more
reliable than the three MSD modules I tried.  I have not used a Petronics
(sp?) system.

I do not know the absolute maximum rpm at which the Universal CDI module will
operate with a 4-cylinder, 4-cycle engine but I've personally run them for
relatively short periods of time, typically less than thirty minutes, above
7,000 rpm with no problem.  (For sustained high-speed operation it would be
wise to direct a blast of ram air at the CDI module's cooling fins.)

I use commonly available silicon-insulated ignition harness (carbon-core) in
conjunction with a stock (black, blue or what-have-you) Bosch ignition coil
and Bosch platinum-electrode spark plugs.  Using these wires, I've not seen
any evidence of insulation failure on vehicles fitted with CDI modules.  My
baja-bug, in which the ignition harness is exposed to the weather, has used
the same wires -- El Cheepo stuff from J.C.Whitney -- for the last ten years.
 Indeed, with silicon/graphite ignition harness the only cause for
replacement has been failure of the air seals or distributor-tower boots. 

The longest service I've gotten from a set of  NON-PLATINUM spark plugs was
about 26,000 miles.  I had a platinum plug fail after 56,000 miles and
changed-out the whole set but I know of a V6 that has accumulated over 80,000
on a set of platinum plugs and is still going strong.

I use commonly available ignition points, whatever is hanging on the rack at
the local FLAPS.  I observe the usual precautions when installing the points
and lubricate the rubbing block with high-temperature silicon grease about
twice a year.  The rubbing block lasts... however long it lasts, usually
about 25,000 miles but I've had some last over 40,000.  The points must be
adjusted as the rubbing block wears, usually once or twice a year, depending
on the miles driven.  Aside from some minor flattening, when triggering a CDI
module the contact points show no signs of wear.  When it comes time to
change the points I usually just plug in the spare distributor, rebuilding it
and replacing the points at my convenience.  I do not see the use of a
points-triggered ignition module as a detriment.  The VW distributor normally
requires service at about the same interval as the rubbing block wears.  It
is no problem to include point replacement with adjusting the distributor's
thrust shims.  Indeed, the use of points-triggering provides an excellent
back-up since it allows me to return to the standard Kettering ignition
should the CDI unit fail.  

I know of a case where a vehicle got a 25% boost in its mileage after a CDI
module was installed... (20 mpg vs 16) but I suspect there were other factors
involved.  Typically, I see a 5% to 10% improvement in highway mileage (ie,
constant high speed) after installation of a CDI module, based on a test-run
of approximately 102 miles (that is, from my shop to Indian Truck Trail &amp;
return).  These appear to be valid figures, borne out by longer runs on
equally good roads but under less controlled conditions (San Diego to Kansas
City &amp; return).  I was disappointed by my mileage on the Inuvik Run -- about
22.5 mpg for about 8,500 miles -- but the vehicle was carrying a fairly heavy
load and the route included about 2,000 miles of bad roads.  

- --------

CDI modules are a practical way to retro-fit modern-day technology to a
1930's-era engine.  The engine remains in tune much longer than those fitted
with the stock Kettering-based ignition, which works best at low engine
speeds.  The spark voltage delivered by the CDI module is fairly constant
across the operating range of the Volkswagen engine, providing a cleaner burn
and better economy at higher rpms.

The strongest endorsement for this type of ignition modification comes not
from me but from the automotive industry, which abandoned the Kettering
ignition as soon as electronic systems of equal reliability became available.

Several messages asked how it was possible for a CDI module costing under a
hundred dollars to perform as well as one costing over $600.  I don't have an
answer for that because I find fault with the question itself.  Perhaps the
real question should be 'How good a system do I need?'  In the case of early
air-cooled VW engines, it's clear to me that the Universal CDI module is good
enough.
