&gt; Okay, I have a question: where can I get canvas?  I want to patch some
&gt; holes in my poptops.  I don't need much, but I don't know where to start
&gt; looking (er, well, I guess I started here).

Check to see if you have a fabric outlet in your area. Reupholstery 
shops sell it at a premium, but not too bad a price if you can get by 
with &quot;scraps&quot;. They use it for tops. Some RV centers carry a supply, 
used for awnings, and the like. I've even seen it for sale at some 
fabric stores.
