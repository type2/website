Subject: RE: [T2] Sliding Window Gaskets

&gt; Incidentally, we carry new OEM sliding windows for busses (as well as
&gt; new European made seals), for anyone who prefers new to used. $132.95
&gt; each for the windows (parts 56631and 56632, left and right
&gt; respectively.)

Ron do they come with screens?
Seals seperate I assume?
&gt;
