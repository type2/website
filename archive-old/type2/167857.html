Subject: Re: [T2] Heater Box Header Pipes

Hoy hananero, Batman! I hope you're not camping out in the California
forests this summer. Don't park in tall dry grass!

Not speaking from practical experience here, but it would seem to me that
stripping off the heat sink and removing the forced air cooling may have
something to do with the pipes getting hotter. Heater boxes not only heat
the air for the cabin, they strip the heat from the exhaust. Your muffler is
probably hotter as well.

Then again, maybe they are cherry red inside the heater boxes and we just
can't see it.

If all else is well, I wouldn't get too excited about the headers being hot
enough to see.

I also talked to Jake about another related exhaust issue.  I explained to
&gt; him
&gt; that the header pipes are running extremely hot.  The other evening after
&gt; a
&gt; short drive I noticed they were cherry red.  So it seems my exhaust leak
&gt; may
&gt; only be a symptom of another bigger problem.
