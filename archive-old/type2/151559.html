Subject: Fuel line replacement

Replaced the fuel lines on my '79 FI Bus yesterday.
Had one start to leak on me. Fortunately, I recently
ordered the fuel line replacement kit from germansupply_dot_com.
Great kit guys!

I'd like to make a suggestion for those with FI and are
planning to replace their fuel lines. Go ahead and order
a set of injector seals and have them handy. I had to remove
my injectors in order to get the old hoses off. My seals were
shot and I didnt have new ones. :( So I get to do that job
another day.

After I get everything put back together. I got the engine
started to check for leaks. It wouldn't idle. I checked
and rechecked everything..vacuum hoses, etc. I decided to
wait until morning to see what happens. Well, this morning,
it starts fine and idles fine. Later in the day though,
it wont hold an idle. It will after driving for a few minutes.
I suppose my cold start valve may be dying.

I am glad I replaced those fuel lines though. Most of them
have been on there since 1979!

Darren Evans-Young,
'79 Bus
