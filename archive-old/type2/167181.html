The curtain stayed in place and would slide to cover the window. The slider
part was riveted to the body as I remember.

Snaps are a good way to do this as you can snap your curtain into place and it
will stay tight and you can open and close the cargo door and it won't get
caught in anything.

&gt; 1) Can someone post a picture/explain to me how the curtain rod that&gt; hangs
above the sliding door is hung. &gt;
