Well I've only been driving aircooled VWs for 8 years, 4 or 5 of that time 
I've been on this list. In that time I've heard lots of 'tales of woe' re GEX 
engines but I cannot recall one re VEGE. I don't recall any one on this list 
having a problem with an engine from ATK who are VEGEs North American 
distributor either.

Lots of people in the UK fit a VEGE engine because they want a good quality 
rebuild, and those I know have been satisfied. I also know folk who have been 
around VWs for many years who say this is the best readily available 
replacement rebuilt engine in the UK.

In the UK a replacement 1600 engines are priced roughly as follows  cheep 
rebuild £250 ($400USA)
    budget rebuild £500 ($800USA)
    VEGE remanufactured £800 ($1300)
    new VW  £1000 ($1600USA)
    new VW with FI  £1600 ($2300USA) [a wonderful engine]

I would not describe a VEGE engine as cheep, neither by reputation (rather 
than personal experience) would I equate the quality of VEGE engines with the 
reputation of GEX engines.

Good luck
