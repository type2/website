Alright, I'm desparate now.

I'm in a sling and need to sale the '77 Bus I have recently had painted.
I am willing to take any and all offers on her. Make me an offer, I just
might take it.

Again, this Bus is in middle TN and here are some facts about it:

New white paint (looks great)
New brakes all the way around
New chrome VW hubcaps
New antennea
AM/FM cassette deck
Recent clutch adjustment
New starter
New alternator
New acclerator spring
Recent tune up
New parking brake
New shifter bushings and coupler

This Bus runs great and is driven daily. Odometer says 97k miles. There
are NO dents in this Bus and NO RUST. Very straight and clean.

I am willing to let this Bus go at any reasonable offer. You must come
and get it as I would not have time to drive it to you.

P-mail for more information and a phone number.

Courtney
