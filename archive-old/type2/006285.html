Last Spring I foolishly ordered a catalog online from Camping World, because
I wanted to see what they carried in the way of freshwater pumps.

Every month since I have received a membership solicitation from the Good
Sam Club.  I just toss them out unopened.

However, we often see VW campers with Good Sam Club stickers in the window
so they must accept VWs as members.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Ya'll might look into Trailer Life's 'Good Sam' club.  A Westy *is* a
motor home in about half the US anyway!  &lt;&lt;
