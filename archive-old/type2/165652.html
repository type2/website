&gt; I borrowed a decibel meter from work Friday to test it on my way home.

Keep in mind that there are various ways to measure sound level.  I agree
that buses are noisy inside, but since it is much less time than an
occupational exposure I would not fret about hearing loss.

OTOH, if you're driving a bus on the highway 8 hours a day I would be
worried.
