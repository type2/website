Hello all-

I was checking the connections to my injectors- having read someone's 
archived message saying that one side of the plug, when probed with a 
grounded test lamp, would show constant power (with ignition key in &quot;on&quot; 
position).  Funny thing is... BOTH sides of the blue connectors light up the 
grounded lamp, even though one side is just supposed to be an open 
(infinitely resistant) ground from the ECU.

Also, the check with the test lamp across the two connectors of the injector 
plug during operation of the starter, which should show pulsating light as 
the ECU grounds the circuit, is showing no light.

Checking the FI &quot;loom,&quot; or &quot;snake&quot; as I prefer to call it, for possible 
shorts or breaks comes up empty- as far as I can tell everything checks out 
perfectly.

SO...

Is it abnormal for both pins in each injector plug (from the loom, not on 
the injector) to have constant power (with key in &quot;on&quot; position, engine not 
running)?

In troubleshooting the non-starting bus (which a few days prior to not 
starting, would stall at every opportunity and felt restricted power-wise), 
ignition system seems normal, fuel pressure exists (though I haven't 
actually pulled the injectors to check flow &amp; stream), and many parts were 
swapped with parts from Eric's stash of extras (including using his '77 ECU, 
though the test lamps were not used during this swap).

Now I'm starting to worry about &quot;hydraulic locking.&quot;  Would this occur in a 
flooded engine? (one of two assumed possibilities for my bus not starting- 
the other being a fuel-starved engine)

ALSO...

A compression check turned up no obvious abnormalities (all 4 cylinders 
between 140 and 150 psi- no &quot;wet test&quot; was performed), though I suspect a 
blow-by problem, and I have white smoke during warm-up period (back in the 
day, when the bus ran... in September).

Would an engine with hydraulic locking show normal or high compression?  The 
only engine I've ever turned by hand is this one, and then only recently, so 
I don't know what it's supposed to feel like. It's a tough pull through the 
stroke (kinda making a creaky noise... almost ratchety, but loose at TDC of 
each cylinder.

If I can keep a weekend or two free this month, I'll get some buds to help 
me pull the engine so I can check out the condition of the pistons and 
valves.  AFAIK the engine has been untouched in 23 years.  I bought the Bus 
in May, and had a roadtrip to the beach (Atlanta to Duck, NC).  I haven't 
been able to register it, due to inability to pass GA emissions.  It seemed 
to be running hot.

Thanks for any help (plus BIG thanks to anyone involved in maintaining this 
list and archives and those countless contributors of useful information).

I am now prepared to accept the worst.
