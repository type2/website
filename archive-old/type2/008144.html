Thanks for the info Erik.  From your measurements it seems that mine may be OK.

If you look inside the AFM on the resistive surface, you will see that it is
not just a single, smooth path, but it is interrupted every few mm or so by
lines.

It is my guess that these segments may be the reason that the resistance does
not change as you might expect.  I too would like to find more detailed info
on the AFM function.

There is a site on the web which has the Bosch FI manual online, but it does
not go into this kind of detail.

You may or may not already know about th the following sites..
