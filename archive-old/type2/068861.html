Hey Sean,

&gt; Jack,
&gt; Excellent procedure but what you want instead of a Ford truck solenoid
&gt; is a headlight or horn relay.  Read Bob's sermon on solenoids for more
&gt; information, but the basic thing is that the Ford truck solenoid takes
&gt; almost as much current to activate as the VW solenoid, which kind of
&gt; defeats the purpose of the mod.  On my '78 I did this with an auxiliary
&gt; light relay (got it at the FLAPS, it's used for fog lights) which was
&gt; rated for 30 amps and it did great!  My current '81 has the Ford truck
&gt; solenoid mod, I'll have to see how well it holds up but I'm considering
&gt; removing it and putting in a regular relay.

Good points, all.  I think that the recommendation for the generic Ford
solenoid is due to the higher throughput amperage than that sustainable by
the Bosch relays.  In cold weather I would think that the starter could
pull =&gt; 50 amps.  Will the Bosch relay carry that kind of short term load? 
Anyone know the max starting amperage of a Vanagon starter? 

&gt;From an empirical standpoint, I've had the Ford relay in place for several 
years and the system hasn't hiccuped once.  I would think that if the Ford 
pulled the same activation current as the starter solenoid that I would 
have continued to have problems even after the modification.  Not trying 
to be contrary, just my observations.

I think we'll have to see whose solution is best over time.  For now, as
long as the system's functional I'd leave it in place.  My philosophy is
if it ain't broke, don't fix it...;)  YMMV, though, of course. 

Jack
