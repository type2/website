Subject: RE: [T2] Re; Lincoln Welder Comparison

FWIW,

A properly operated TIG will leave almost no weld to grind.
A properly operated TIG will not warp the metal.
Different techniques and tools are used when TIG welding.

This is why TIG welders are the choice of custom shops, fabricators and
artists who have the time to use them. In the &quot;real world&quot; TIGs can be
difficult to master and very time expensive. Most body shop repairs and
simple panel replacements are easily done with a MIG since they are quick
and practical. Neither is &quot;better&quot; than the other, just different.

I could go into the long and exhaustive details to explain the differences
and pro &amp; cons, but that information can be found online or in many
excellent books available to the public.

I spend many hours behind a TIG and can say they provide the precision and
control a MIG can't deliver. In fact I often do the opposite of Terry use my
MIG to tack weld and the TIG to do the precise finish work. But of course
I'm not doing body work and I don't have a list of clients who need their
vehicles back.

Professional welders consider welding an art-form so it can be a sensitive
subject. Every Pro welder uses a different technique, uses different
equipment and approaches solutions differently. It all has to be taken with
a grain of salt.

The Tig weld is much harder than the Mig, and a bitch to grind clean
without warping the metal in the process.

A light tack with a Tig is good--then finish with a mig stitch weld for
a no distortion welded surface, that's easy to clean up.
