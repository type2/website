Subject: 81 vanagon tranny problem
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hi everyone,

Last month my 81 westy got stuck in 4th gear.  The clutch allowed me to roll 
the van both forward and backward.  The relay lever moved normally, yet the 
transmission could not be taken out of gear.  So I finally got around to 
dropping the engine/tranny and pulled the gear shift housing expecting to 
find something glaringly obvious...then I realized that I don't know what I'm 
doing and could have accidentally fixed the problem when I removed the 
housing.  The shift levers move freely and the closest thing to a problem is 
a worn locking key on the main shaft bearing.  Could this be the problem?  
About a quarter inch of wear on the locking key has allowed the bearing to 
rotate maybe 10-15 degrees counter-clockwise.  

Is there a way to check the transmission at this point (i.e. shift through 
the gears with the levers and turn the drive flanges on the differential)?  I 
have the Bentley manual and removing the gear carrier housing looks kind of 
scary.

TIA,
Craig Brewer
