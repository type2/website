Subject: Review:  Bus Depot Large Sideview Mirrors; Under Dash Parcel
  Tray

I had some goodies from Bus Depot installed:

1.  The large, Brazilian &quot;Vanagon Style&quot; side view mirrors and

2.  The under dash parcel tray with cup holders


I love the mirrors.  Not a doubt about it.  They are perhaps larger than the
mirrors on my Treg and have a slight tint to cut glare.  I was behind a late
model Wrangler yesterday and what do you know?  It's mirrors were
suspiciously the same, except for the mounting piece.  So I guess a convex
Jeep mirror would fit in the Brazilian housing...  Hmmmm!  For what it's
worth, the mounting interface is perfectly shaped to the Bus door contour
and looks to be paintable.

The under dash parcel tray has a few minor bugs but is way cool otherwise.
Plenty of room for soda can and sandwich, CD player and sunglasses.  Beats
the little &quot;Car console&quot; I placed on the floor between the seats.  The first
bug is that the cable for the defroster/foot well flap is too short to be
moved aside to the small space between the two halves of the shelves.  I'm
going to have to clearance the left shelf so the cable can operate properly.
(Note that I managed to refit the cable, but it is skewed to the side and
very tight against the plastic.  I'd prefer a bit of slack so it doesn't pop
off in the dead of winter!)  Also, the outside edges are somewhat shaky.
Reinforcement is in order and I'll play with it to see what works--extra
mounting screws, a small brace, filling the underside of the plastic with
epoxy or such.
