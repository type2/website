  i'm in a bit of a bind here. i am under the bus with the wheels off and I
stupidly used two hydraulic jacks to hold it up. well they have slowly
deflated while I was working on the center pin problem. i was able to drag my
lap top under here using a breaker bar to type this. Will someone please call
my wife to tell her to come out and get me out! She is pissed as hell at me
right now as I have spent too much time and money on the bus, and thinks I am
out with some bus friends. I have yelled for an hour and she can not or will
not respond. I just need her to jack it up a bit to get me out. I'm Ok just
need to get out. I am a little tight under here and it is raining. Call her at
4239571591 and tell her I am out here. This is uncomfortable. Thanks
