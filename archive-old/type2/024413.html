&gt; Boy, it sure would be easier to explain this with a picture...

 I can picture what you're describing, I'm not convinced by it, though.

&gt; Does the term 'polar moment of inertia' mean anything to you?

 Yes, but I don't think it's relevant to this discussion.

&gt; ... By moving the
&gt; wheel in relation to the bearings you are changing it's moment.  ie:
the
&gt; lever that is acting on the bearings.  Assume that the stock wheel is
&gt; centered between the inner and outer bearings.  The load is carried
equally
&gt; by each bearing.  Move the wheel either way (but lets assume out for
the
&gt; sake of discussion.)  You now have a greater portion of the load being
&gt; carried by the outer bearing. ...

 No, the idea was to use a spacer to correct a wheel with the wrong
offset.
The wheel will end up correctly centred on the bearings, but connected
to 
the hub by &quot;spokes&quot; which are further from the midpoint between the two
races.

 I'll try some ascii art (fixed font required!):

      ___        ___
     (   )      (   )
      ---        ---
         |          |
        |           |
       #|         #=|   &quot;=&quot; is the spacer
        |           |   &quot;#&quot; is the hub
         |          |
      ---        ---
     (   )      (   )
      ~~~        ~~~

      stock     offset
      wheel     wheel

 As you can see, the offset wheel is correctly centred WRT the tyre 
centreline and the hub (bearing midpoint). It also has the same
diameter, and so exerts identical forces on the bearings under
cornering.

&gt;   Using a spacer to move it moves its
&gt; 'moment'.  The point about which it axially rotates.  Translated
through the
&gt; longer studs.  Might be that there's a physics expert on the list
that can
&gt; better explain it. (Or correct me if I'm in error...)

 See above. I don't think &quot;moment&quot; is the right word, and we seems to
be thinking of using the spacers differently.
 I _would_ expect forces on the studs+nuts to be higher, BTW, since they
will be have to hold the whole assembly together and they are further 
removed from the plane in which the forces are exerted. I don't think
these forces are transferred to the bearings, though, they are contained
within the wheel/stud/nut/hub unit.

 It's possible that the force from the wheel could be considered to act
at the end of the longer studs, instead of in the plane of the tyre
centreline and the bearing midpoint. If this is the case then my
reasoning is flawed and the bearing load _would_ be increased.
 The reason I don't think that this is correct is that, in the absence
of lateral loads, the bearing could be a single race, mounted
in the tyre-centreline/bearing-midpoint plane described above and it 
would work fine.
 It's only as you exert lateral loads on the wheel, eg by cornering,
that the spacing between outer and inner races becomes important.

 Is this clear? If so, is it correct? :-).

Cheers,
	W.

&gt;
&gt;  Dunno about the exact measurements but can you explain why the
&gt; spacers are so bad, when their role is to correct the offset?
&gt;  I can see that spacers will increase the strain on the studs
&gt; themselves, as they will have to hold the assmbly together, but
&gt; surely once the assembly is, er, assembled the offset will be
&gt; correct, the wheel will be centred on the bearings and all will
&gt; be well in the world?
&gt;  The leverage exerted on the bearings by the lateral (cornering)
&gt; forces on the bottom of the tyre will be related to tyre diameter
&gt; rather than wheel depth, yes?
&gt;  Is there another wear mechanism I'm missing?
&gt;
&gt;  (I am aware that there will be secondary effects caused by using
&gt;   wider tyres, lower profiles etc. but I don't think that's caused
&gt;   by the use of spacers).
&gt;
