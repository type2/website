This is caused by a &quot;gizmo&quot; that I can not remember the name of, it
increases idle on automatics to adjust for differences in idle speed
between gear lever in PARK, NEUTRAL,  DRIVE, REV, etc...  Mine was
removed by the PO for reasons beyond my comprehension.  So when I move
the lever into DRIVE my idle actual decreases slightly.  If the increase
is too much, you may need to adjust.
