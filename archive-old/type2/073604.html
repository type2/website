Subject: Re: [T2] Re: DP to SP conversion 

Oops, mis typed that....the 71 was a DP with the doghouse.
70 was the last SP.



&gt; A SP has better low end torque....just what a bus needs.
&gt; A DP has better top end....just what a light beetle needs.
&gt;
&gt; In the USA, 71 buses were the last of the upright 1600's.
&gt; They were SP.....
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I see all this talk of converting from DP to SP. I hope this is not a stupid
&gt; &gt; question but why would one want to convert from DP to SP. I always thought
&gt; &gt; that DP was an improvement over SP.
