 Snoopy, I found the same problems when I was trying to get info on a 72 Single Cab I own but are now having to sell.
Maybe things might've been different if there'd actually been anyone out there willing to help me with the necessary facts when I needed help.
Neale's a fellow compatriot of mine &amp; has tried to help me but ran into the same problems trying to find info for me that he has finding it for himself.
What's going on?
Don't Baywindow trucks have cred too?
Sites like dropgates_dot_com would almost have the uniniated believe VW stopped producing pickups in mid 1967.
I'm not saying splits aren't worthy but how many of us can afford to risk running one everyday, let alone buy it in the first place.
Cheers,

people had asked when I found anything to let them know. So.... This is all
the info I have received so far.. If you have any technical info you could
pass on to Neale he would be very grateful..

&gt; Hi Snoopy,
&gt;
&gt; Funny you should mention that, I was thinking the very same thing a couple
of
&gt; months ago, and started a Baytrucks page (http://go.to/baytrucks), but
there's
&gt; pretty much nothing there, as yet, as I just can't find much info.
&gt;
&gt; Any leads you may have on technical documentation/information/diagrams etc
&gt; would be greatly appreciated, as I'd love to make the page into a resource
that
&gt; we can actually use.
&gt;
&gt; All the best,
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
