Subject: I need some stuff in Colorado

Hi all!

I am in the process of reassembling a couple of busses.  I need a few 
things and wondered if anyone in Colorado (or close) has what I need.

I am looking for a new engine for my '68 bus.  I pretty much need a 
turn key as the PO removed the engine for a sand rail.  I would like a 
1600 dp type 1 for this but I will consider others.

For my '72 westy I need a 1700 long block or turn key.

I need some new or rebuildable front seats for the '72.   Does anyone 
know how hard it is to graft other seats into a bus?  I think I would 
rather go with &quot;stock&quot; seats but I am considering other options.

Well, TIA
