Subject: RE: [T2] Anyone using 195/70/15's?

Continental Vanco 195/70/15's have an overall diameter of 25.7&quot;. This
measurement varies from tire to tire. I'll let you figure out the rest... I
don't have a 15&quot; rim to look at. Since the tire and rim overlap, sidewall
height depends on where you take your measurements. 5.35&quot; would be a good
starting point.

&gt; From: Dave [mailto:brooksdj_at_earthlink_dot_net]

&gt; Wondering if anyone is using this size.  I'd like to get measure height of
&gt; tire and measurement from rim out (side wall height).
