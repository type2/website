Subject: Re: [T2] sliding door woes

Hi Dave, Actually that wouldn't work.
The cam securely grabs the catch. (locking mechanism)
I started thinking about the silly lock. Why two
cables coming out. Even though I had banged the
heck out of the other one in all the ways I could
think of, I went back at it. Wiggled and wiggled
and pushed and pushed.
It released the catch. For being something so
'simple', man what a frustrating problem.
It's open, the milk in the fridge, the weiners in the
fridge, the beer going down my throat. (and other stuff being
cooled appropriately)
My SO is kinda on the throws of hitting me with something
so it was good timing.
I now need to go fabricate the steel line that snapped.
Not sure if I ordered it, that it would get here in time
before I was off to my next destination.
At least I can open the door now.

Thanks for the help everyone, and if someone is
curious I will send a picture of the silly contraption.

James

James-
You are right, sir! The door won't open.
Work at the rear. Remove the channel cover,
lift the rear of the door out of the rear catch.
