Subject: Heating Problems (my girlfriend is freezing and hates me)

Hello all,
Just wondering if anyone has done a study or at least
fooled around with the heating setup in their bus and
might have some advice for me. The darn thing makes me
feel like Quinn the eskimo when I'm driving and my
girlfriend gets a little agitated when she has to wear
every piece of clothing that we own (including my long
underwear). 
  Right now there is cold air coming in through the
vents, I taped up the intake in front to no avail and
the heater fan is about as useful as a bottle of
antifreeze. There are a few things about the whole
heating system that I dont understand. The fan blows
air into the heat exchangers and once it gets through
those the tubes go up a little to a valve mechanism
which opens when the lever in  the cockpit is pulled
down. by the valve mechanism there is the pipe running
up to the front of the bus and then theres another
pipe pointing down that just blows air out. what is
this second pipe doing? should I plug it up? 
  While I'm at it has anyone tried running a second
fan somwhere? I'd like to be able to do it without
cutting the bottom ducting so something in the engine
compartment would be cool. what about running tubes up
 to the fan intake from behind the cylinders as a way
of recyling that hot air and preheating it before it
enters the heat exchange. 
  Anyway any advice is welcome and if I coudld get my
Long Underwear back that would be great.
