Subject: Restore or Replace my Propane tank on 78 Westy ?

The rust was only slight surface rust, so I restored my tank seven years ago
by sandblasting it, priming, and painting it with two stage paint.

On refilling, no one has ever asked about it, as it looks brand new.

One caution, the welded-on information panel below, be sure and seal it with
both paint (spray it in the edges) and then seal it with seam sealer before
you paint it overall. This will ensure no moisture gets in there to rust it
out where you can't see it.

I am in the process of restoring my 1978 Westy, and am looking for
recommendations
for the propane stove tank. I have never yet used it, but want to ensure it
is
in good working order
and no leaks. To that end I will be replacing the lines, regulators, etc. The
tank itself
is also somewhat rusty.
