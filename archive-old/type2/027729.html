Jon-

Assuming similarities among all model year loaves, the backrest part of the 
back seat in my 78 bus was attached (and will eventually be reattached) by 
two bolts of the seatbelt variety.  There is a hinge thingy on either side 
of the seat with a hole for the bolt, which screws into a threaded slot on 
the wheel well.

&gt;
&gt;I have a 72 Bus and I just got the rear seat for it.  I just want to know 
&gt;how
&gt;does the back part of the seat, the part that folds forward, attach to the
&gt;bus?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Jon
