Subject: VW Trends' bus issue -- kind of a disappointment

The much anticipated VW Trends 50-year bus issue is a big disappointment 
from where I sit. Baywindow are the orphans as usual.

But the worst of it are the pictures. The magazine's art director had 
best not run into me in a dark alley, as I shall surely throttle him 
good. What use is a photograph that is 1&quot; X 1-1/4&quot;? I'm sure you could 
get better resolution in Braille.

I wish he would also get it that when they run a feature on a bus with 
custom interior work, the photographs of the interior should take up more 
space in the book that the bus owner's girlfriend's bikini.
