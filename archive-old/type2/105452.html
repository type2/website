Subject: Re: [T2] Vibration/noise in front around 55 mph?

&gt; &gt; Sounds like the speedo cable.
&gt; &gt; You could unscrew it from the speedo and spray some lube down the cable
&gt; &gt; casing.
&gt; &gt; Tri3 Teflon spray should reactivate the lube that is still present on
the
&gt; &gt; cable.

&gt;
&gt; Cool.  That makes plenty of sense.  I'll give it a try and let you know
&gt; how it goes.

Occam's Razor would also suggest that perhaps you lost a balancing weight
off of one of the rims?  Losing a weight can induce a nasty vibration at
speed, without anything else being wrong.  Good luck!
