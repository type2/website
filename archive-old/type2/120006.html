Ha, thanks Gerald  :) 

...guess I'm used to thinking of tranny at the back, fan in front. That must 
be part of the total change in mindset that James Jackson told me about 
earlier  :)


&gt; When talking about your Bus' mechanicals always remember FIF (Front is
&gt; Front). Everything is discussed in relation to the front/rear orientation
&gt; of the vehicle.
&gt;
&gt; You did get one thing right -- the seal you're talking about IS called the
&gt; REAR main seal. But it's at the FRONT of the engine. That one still
&gt; confuses me. ;-)

Once you pull the engine out and let it spin around on the hoist a few times 
it must somehow lose that FIF orientation  ;)
