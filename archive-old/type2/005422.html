With the lack of any decent working bus email in the uk and the state of the
ssvc mailinglist - i've just created VWBUSUK
barndoors, splits, bays, campers, whatever.
UK based, but anyone welcomed.

go to http://groups.yahoo_dot_com/group/vwbusuk

you can set yahoogroups to send email in real time, daily digest, or read
and post online like a forum or message board.
email attatchements are dissabled - if you'd like to share pictures or files
you can upload them to http://groups.yahoo_dot_com/group/vwbusuk/files/

for general aircooled vw  - please join edubs
http://groups.yahoo_dot_com/group/edubs buses, bugs, trekkers etc.

please dont take this as trying to drag us europeans away from type2 or
vintagebus - nothing of the sort - just simply trying to establish a decent
and useful gathering place for us.

Glynn
