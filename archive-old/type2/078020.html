Subject: 78 transporter $350 in bay area if picked up tonight

This is *not* mine, nor do I know the seller.

78 transporter, starts, idles and drives fine, needs brakes and registration
is not current.
Owner claims to &quot;have all of the paperwork&quot;

one of the heater boxes has a hole in it also. body starting to rust in
usual areas.

I might go check it out myself, not sure if my roommates would appreciatte
another bus floating around the place....

parts let me know.

Christopher
