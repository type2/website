You certainly are my equal as regards adding additional explanation of
benefit to us all. Many many options to consider before jumping on a quick
fix or compromise to purpose. It means you must consider your purpose
first, then pay the freight to make it happen. 

If it's a hobby car, it can sit till you have the wherewithall to do it
right or wrong as you will. If it's a vehicle of daily need, you either
look for any compromise to cost to try to get by, fix it as cheap as
possible even if it takes a GEX price, fix it right even if it takes
another loan, or sell out/park it and replace it with something else, even
if that takes another loan. If no car means no work OR play, you have to
get very very serious about purpose. 

Even a weekend camper can be a holiday killer if safety and reliability are
hampered with a &quot;got to do it cheaper than it really costs to do it right&quot;
attitude. The purpose of having fun can get lost in that shuffle.

Try this attitude. Got to do it right regardless the cost cause I can't
afford the down side of compromise that leads to failure. 

Purpose first, knowledge second, do the right thing third.
