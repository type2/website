&gt; Volks,
&gt; could somebody offer some definitions for me:
&gt; Burned Valves:

Valves eroded by hot combustion gases so that they leak.  Commonly caused
by too tight valve lash.

&gt; Valve Lash:

The play in the valve actuating system, typically measured at the end of
the valve stem.

&gt; Also, what are the risks to valves that are tightened to .002 (too tight)

Burned valves

 or
&gt; loosened to .010 (too loose)?

Loss of power, possible &quot;hammering&quot; of valve train components

&gt; Finally, when a shop does a &quot;valve job&quot; what does that include? (besides
&gt; presumably, adjusting the valve gap).

Removal of head, inspection for cracks, replacement of valves, valve
guides and seats. (if it is a good job)
