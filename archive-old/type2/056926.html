I've driven several buses with the Weber progressive, and this problem
seems to be the norm for this application.

When I once bought a Weber progressive, it came with an extra idle jet
(70) with instructions to swap it for the 60, which should be swapped in
turn with the 50, to help smooth the transition off of idle.  It helps
some, I think.  But this doesn't really eliminate the problem you
discuss.  My Weber didn't become drivable until I switched back from the
009 to the stock vac/mech advance distributor, but with the vacuum
advance disabled (disconnected).  I set total advance to 32, and advance
at idle ended up at a position that allowed good acceleration off of
idle.
