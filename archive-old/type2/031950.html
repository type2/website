Subject: Maybe I've got this &quot;deck height&quot; issue solved
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.OSF.3.91.990509001446.1893B-100000_at_Sherlock.SIMS.Berkeley.EDU&gt;

If you haven't been keeping up, I posted a question regarding deck 
heights in the 2.0L Vanagon engines I'm rebuilding.  I measured something 
around .02&quot; (with the barrel shims that came with the P&amp;C's in place) 
whereas Tom WILSON (I said Watson in previous post) specifies a minimum of 
.04&quot;.

HOWEVER, Steve Blackham said something to me that got me thinking (and it 
hurts!) about the head shim that came with my gasket kit.  It measures 
right about .03&quot;, and .03&quot; + .02&quot; = .05&quot;, right in line with Wilson's 
figures.  Since the Type4 engine is the only air-cooled VW engine that 
uses the head shim (I think) maybe Wilson was just sloppy in his 
writing?  Maybe the real statement is &quot;the distance between the top of 
the piston at TDC and the cylinder wall contact point of the head should 
be at least .04 inches; for Type4 engines, include the thickness of the 
head shim in this calculation.&quot;?????????????

Whadaya think?
