Subject: Edisto Freeze Yer Toe Edisto Beach, SC This weekend

Hey Volks,

Full Moon Bus Club invites you to join us at Edisto Freeze Yer Toe This
weekend.
For more info.... http://quicksitemaker_dot_com/members/snoop/Edisto.html

I will be out there hopefully before noon on Thursday if anyone wants to
join me.  As soon as I get the code for the gate I will relay back to Diesel
Joel.  He will post it on the website Thursday.(url above)  If you leave
before he posts it, but get there after 6 pm.  Look for the rock
http://quicksitemaker_dot_com/members/snoop/therock.html to the left of the exit
gate.

If you would like to contribute to the communal cooking go to the url below.

And lastly if you can donate any prizes for the door prizes at the Sat bon
fire please bring them.  I have collected a few so far but it would be so
much nicer if we had some more.

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
