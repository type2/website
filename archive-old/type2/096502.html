Subject: Re: [T2] vw pics and vwoa license


Janice,

Thanks for pointing that out....that's part of my appeal to the
two lawyers on the list.

So, I wonder if the folks that have the old brochures up can get away with 
it because they are strictly &quot;informative&quot; under the fair use act.

Cheers ,dave

&gt; &gt; So, does this mean that I m not permitted to show pics of any of my
&gt; &gt; vw vehicles unless I sign this agreement?....I don't think so...I &quot;own&quot;
&gt; &gt; those cars, I don't license them from vw like software.  And should be
&gt; &gt; able to display pics of them anywhere I want ....and give others
&gt; &gt; permission to do the same.
&gt; 
&gt; This all sounds entirely reasonable to me, and all they are saying is that
&gt; you have to provide your own photos.. don't use ones from their site,
&gt; brochures, etc. They have a right to exclusive commercial use of their own
&gt; works anyway, under copyright law, so this goes without saying. Of course,
&gt; let us not forget something else.. Under the so-called &quot;Fair Use Doctrine&quot;
&gt; (look it up at Cornell_dot_edu), you can reproduce excerpts of anything
&gt; protected by copyright law, to the extent that this doctrine and pursuant
&gt; judgements allow, in a non-commercial environment only. This generally
&gt; pertains to educational and informative sites, but does not allow you to
&gt; reproduce works in their entirety, so far as I know. Here a test of
&gt; &quot;reasonableness&quot; would probably come into play. So, my question is this.. If
&gt; one can invoke the &quot;Fair Use Doctrine&quot;, then why would anyone sign a
&gt; specific agreement with VWOA or VWAG, leaving them potentially open to
&gt; breach of contract suits? Jan B
