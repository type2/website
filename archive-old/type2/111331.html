Subject: Propane powered bus

Re: propane powered busses, the normal conversion uses a mixer mounted in addition to the carburetor. You can use either fuel by just flipping a switch. The latest propane systems use fuel injection systems very similar to gasoline systems but few of the conversion systems are that good. The fuel is actually called liquid petroleum gas, or LPG. It really is mostly propane, at least the better grades are. One of the problems with air cooled engines running on propane is no coolant to heat the regulator/vaporizer. Most conversions use engine coolant to keep the regulator from freezing. Air cooled (heated) regulators are available but they're mostly for low power applications. The most common systems are made by IMPCO and involve oxygen sensors in a feedback system. They work pretty good. I teach alternative fuel systems as part of my job and would love to help someone put together one of these. I've been considering converting my bus, a '71, but haven't gotten around to it. I'm about
 four projects behind all the time. If anyone is interested contact me and I'll help all I can.
