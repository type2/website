Subject: [ANOTHER QUESTION] Number of Gallons to Paint

Greetings Group,

Thank y'all for the feedback, but I forgot one *important* detail!  When we
talk &quot;number of gallons of paint&quot;, are we talking before or after mixing
reducer, etc.?  For example, the paint I'm considering using is mixed in a
ratio of 8:3:1 (paint:reducer:hardener).  If I can still do math, this
means that if I need one gallon of &quot;sprayable mixture&quot;, then I only need
2/3 gallon (approximately 85.3 ounces) of paint (also need 1 quart of
reducer and approximately 10.7 ounces of hardener).

So, are suggestions for &quot;number of gallons of paint&quot; typically made with
respect to actualy paint (assuming some sort of reducer and hardener mixing
ratio) or are suggestions typically made with respect to &quot;sprayable
mixture&quot;?

TIA,
David
