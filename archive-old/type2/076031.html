Subject: Re: [T2] Breaking in an engine

I'm sure George has noticed that most of the motorcycle rags write to
impress themselves much more than they do to actually inform people. With as
many years in motorcycles as I do in VW's they have always been to me little
more than comic books, more so than the rags for VW's. At least in Hot babes
and dune buggies, if there's not a useful article, there's at least the
babes.

&gt; &gt; I was cruising around the internet a couple days ago and came upon this
&gt; &gt; article.  Just curious what you all think about it:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; http://pistol1.home.mindspring_dot_com/enginebreakin.htm
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It's much different than the &quot;run your engine at 2k for 20 minutes&quot;
&gt; &gt; method...
&gt;
&gt; The article shows a lack of care that causes me to take it with a grain of
&gt; salt.  The early reference to BMEP makes me think that the author is
&gt; writing to impress, not to inform,  Brake (not &quot;Break&quot;) Mean Effective
&gt; Pressure is a value used to calculate engine output and efficiency, not
&gt; ring sealing.  What the author really wants to use here is simply cylinder
&gt; pressure.
&gt;
&gt; Also, keep in mind that this article is written with motorcycles in mind
&gt; and most motorcycles use different materials for their rings and
&gt; cylinders than our ancient VWs.
&gt;
&gt; I'll stick with the 2000/20 breakin myself.
