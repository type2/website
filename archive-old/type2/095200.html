Subject: 69 NADA $3500? 


Hey again folks.
Just went to register my bus here in the lovely state of Vermont (sarcasm) I 
am told my registration fees are 250 dollars! They are telling me that the 
NADA book value on a 69 kombi is 3500 bucks!  Is she serious?  I would only 
pay that kinda dough for one from west coast in sweet condition.  Mine I 
bought for 500 with no motor, and stripped interior! I did not even register 
it as a westie even though I installed everything but the pop top. But 3500? 
  Seems a little off.  Any comments?
