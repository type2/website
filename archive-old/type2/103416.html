Subject: Re: [T2] Acts like out of gas - long update (was engine
  coughing)

&gt;There is a lot of pressure built up in the line as I found out &gt;when I
removed it from the carb and sprayed gas over &gt;everything. If the pump was
bad, wouldn't it be at all &gt;times and all speeds?
&gt;
Think about it! You are getting BACKPRESSURE at the carb..the pump is
working fine.... but the carb must be clogged if you are getting lots of
backpressure.... Get a can of carb cleaner and perhaps a tiny wire to clean
out the carb jets.... I bet that's why your bus is starving for fuel at high
speeds...... it needs more fuel ... but the jets can't deliver because they
are partially clogged.
