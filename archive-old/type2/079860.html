Subject: Re: [T2] Can't figure it out!!!

&gt; acts fine like nothing is wrong... Starts idles everthing is great,
&gt; then... Driving at cruising speeds engine not hot normal temps(its
&gt; about 30 degrees outside), just heading home from church. Been driving
&gt; at speed (65mph or so) for about 10-12 mins, and bus starts to cut out
&gt; and back in, then out but still running kind of, no power, and lots of
&gt; backfiring.

I had the same problem. Turned out to be a loose conection at the combi
relay. I suggest you try pulling each connector pinching it closed a
little, and then pushing it back on. This solved the same problem on my
'77. As the engine is running it probably shakes a connector off a little.

Hope this helps.
