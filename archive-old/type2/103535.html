This is unnecessary. You can find a $2 plastic hand pump at the flaps in the 
gas container section which sucks out the gas so easily you'll feel stupid 
for doing it any other way. &gt;&gt;

But you know when that dark nite of the soul and out-of-gas feeling
comes over you, it will be home waiting for you and that old piece of
water hose will be right there... ;-P
