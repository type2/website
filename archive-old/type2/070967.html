&lt;&lt; I got a letter in the mail to day from my city watchdogs and 
it seems that I am in violation of not one but three city sections 
by parking my truck in the driveway.  &gt;&gt;

So you are not allowed to have a non-operational vehicle parked
on private property within your city limits?  Would a letter from
me stating that you have a transaxle on order for this vehicle
help in your legal headache?  And do you need me to speed
up the scheduled delivery of said gearbox?
