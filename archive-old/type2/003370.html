&gt;      By coincidence, I was about to post the same note about needing sheet
&gt; metal.  I have a 79 2.0 liter that had A/C.  Ii was partially removed when
I
&gt; got the bus- now I am removing the rest.
&gt;     I too, have a large gaping hole on the driver's side of the motor
where
&gt; the compressor was.

Do you need just the corner engine tin? If yes, is the bus a Calif version
or 49 state? 2 different pieces.

Usually the corner of the body where the engine seal goes is also cut, just
to the left of the vin number. Right where the curve in the corner is. A
while back I found a bus at a yard that had A/C and then was removed. On it
was a piece of molded plastic that was made to fill the corner of the body
where the seal went. It was held down with 2 screws. This piece was not
home-made. It was designed and made for this purpose. I have not seen
another one in the past 5 years. Before I mailed it to someone, I looked at
it and thought seriously about checking around locally to have it
duplicated. I didn't and have been kicking myself in the butt ever since.

&gt; I also need the piece of tin that goes under the motor
&gt; on the passenger side.  If anyone has this stuff from a bus they are
parting
&gt; out- please advise. Have $$$ of course.

That piece is the same as 72 to 74.
The drivers side depends on whether it is a Calif version or 49 state.
Calif. is one-year-only, 49 state is 72-74.
 I have that piece.
