Hi, everyone this is my first time posting a message.  Lately I've been real 
into the idea of buying an type 2.  First thing I did was went to the library 
and checked out Muirs, Idiots Guide to Repairing Air Cooled Engines and 
another Reference book.   Ive come to the conclusion that I would want a 
camper ( such as the westfalia), Samba, or a regular transporter which I 
could modify the interior into my own.  But since this will be my first car 
owned solely by me (right now Im driving my moms 240 station wagon) I would 
really like to take some time into reseaching everything. So here come the 
questions...

1.  I live in Northern California, where the condition on most vans are 
reasonable.  I was wondering how much each model would differ from another in 
price, in good condition.  

2.  Do any of you prefer a year? Do you discorouge the buying of a particular 
year? Are any models or years more reliable?

3.  Are VWs good to learn mechanics on?

4.  I know in older trucks you have to either rebuild cylinder heads or fill 
up with a lead additive. Is this also true with VWs, if so what year are you 
safe from engines made to be filled up with leaded gas?

5.  Also Ive heard different deals concerning speed.  A book that I was 
reading said early type 2s hit a top of 60.  But my dad remembered crusing at 
70 with his transporter.  This isnt a big issue, however is 60 mph max speed?

6. How good are the car stereo?   Can it be easily retrofitted with a new 
one?  Once again not a biggy.

Well thats all I can think about right now. Im real anxious for replys.  I 
know I probally asked to much, sorry.  Anyways thanks again.
