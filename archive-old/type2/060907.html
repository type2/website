Hi Volks,

from a German viewpoint, this discussion clearly shows the 
differences between Germany and the US.  Let me elaborate, I'll try 
not to repeat the valid points made by other listees:

First, VW Buses weren't really under-powered in comparison to other 
German cars of the period.  When an Opel Rekord of the late Sixties 
came with 60 horsepower standard, a 47 horsepower VW Bus doesn't look 
so bad.  120 kph was a respectable top speed for a small car in the 
late Sixties, so it would have been okay for a VW Bus too.  This 
isn't V8 country, and never was.  ;-)

Second, unlike in the US, there used to be a clear distinction 
between car and van/truck in public perception until very recently.  
We didn't have this &quot;minivan fad&quot; that I believe the VW Bus started 
in the US, and that Chysler then adopted.  The VW Bus was perceived 
to be not so much a big car than a small bus (as in Greyhound Bus), 
or in its panel van and truck guises, just that: a cargo vehicle; 
i.e., something that lives on the slow lane.

Because third, we have strict speed limit for trucks of more than 2.8 
tons of total weight.  They're limited to 80 kph (50 mph).  The same 
limit is for smaller cars, vans and trucks when pulling a trailer.  
And until very recently, the smaller trucks/vans (we don't really 
make that distinction, they're all &quot;transporters&quot; here) were content 
to go a little faster than the trailers and the big rigs.  (And 
unnerving everyone in a normal car when blocking the fast lane while 
overtaking.  ;-)

And fourth, fuel was and is way more expensive here.  The Type 4 
engine wasn't the only choice because of its fuel consumption.  Those 
100..400 cc that mean more tax aren't really the problem (even today, 
at DM 42 per 100cc and year, they're not), but those 2..6 litres per 
100 km of fuel that it consumes more than the Type 1 may very well 
have been.  (Another reason for its continued availability may have 
been purchase price and competition.) 

So, it was normal that a van would be slower than a car.  And the VW 
Bus wasn't really mindboggingly slow in its time.  What's more, it 
was economical, until Diesel engines became powerful enough to 
replace the gas engines in transporters.  Today, virtually all 
transporters have a Diesel engine here.  Most passenger vans too.  
(Of course, today the Diesels are fast -- a Mercedes Sprinter or VW 
Transporter (Eurovan) TDI will easily run with the pack on the fast 
lane.  Which most of them do.)

People wouldn't really have understood the idea of a 100 hp VW Bus in 
1968.  Heck, we got the Passat (Quantum) with a 1300cc, 55 hp engine 
even in the Eighties!  (And, BTW, Italy got the Loaf with an optional 
1300cc DP, 44 hp engine as well!)

&gt; Those of us w/older t2s have to deal w/them being under powered.Has
&gt; anyone ever researched why they were made that way in the first
&gt; place?Were the vw designers of the 60's and 70's insane when they put
&gt; such small engines in such big vehicles, or was this some kind of
&gt; cruel joke? You would think that a company w/the same origins as
&gt; Porsche and a country w/ the autobahn as their highway system would
&gt; have produced faster cars.Does anyone know why this is,or know of any
&gt; web sites that discuss it? Alexis '70 camper(Butterfly)

Yours,
    Erik.
