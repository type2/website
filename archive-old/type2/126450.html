Subject: Front 50/50 Windows

Wow. I feel stupid (pretty common feeling for me). 

Went to Knott's Soak City yesterday to pick up the kids after work.
Got a good look at the barn door bus they have painted up as
advertising.

The front door windows are 50/50 style. I didn't know those type of
windows were ever put on door windows. I really like that look.

If anybody wants, I can take pics next time I'm over there... I live a
block away and have an annual pass. =D
