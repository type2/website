&gt;  According to the engine code my engine should have Dual pressure relief. 
&gt;  First of all this may be a stupid question but what is dual pressure 
relief? 
&gt; 
&gt;  Second is there some way you can tell by just looking at the engine. The 
&gt;  reason I ask is because on my 1600 DP engine there are two hoses on the 
left 
&gt; 
&gt;  hand lower side of the engine and there are to fittings with a hose 
joining 
&gt;  the two together. Sometime ago the hose that joins these fittings together 
&gt;  broke and I lost all of my oil. So when I look at it I thought it might be 
&gt;  something the P.O. did and it still might be I not sure but anyway I tried 
&gt;  taking out the hose and the fittings and installed two plugs.   Well, 
&gt;  whenever the car would idle the oil light would come one and if I ran the 
&gt;  engine up past an idle the light would go off. So I took out the plugs and 
&gt;  installed the hoses and put an oil filter inline with the hoses this seems 
&gt; to 
&gt;  work okay. So I was wondering if this had anything to do with the Dual 
&gt;  pressure relief or not. If not has anybody ever seen or heard of the kind 
of 
&gt; 
&gt;  thing before?
&gt;  Thanks

Hi all,

First what is a dual pressure relief engine?

When the engine starts and the oil is cold and thick then the narrow 
galleries of the oil cooler cause a high pressure between the pump and the 
oil-cooler, and a low flow of oil through the cooler to the engine - which is 
a bad thing.
To prevent this there is a pressure relief valve which allows the oil to 
bypass the cooler and go straight to the engine. When the oil is warm it 
flows through the cooler easier the back pressure reduces and the relief 
valve closes causing all the oil to flow through the cooler.

Because the oil pump is connected to the cram shaft it turns faster at higher 
rpm creating more pressure in the whole system. To releive this high pressure 
there is a releife valve at the far end of the oil galleries that allows 
excess pressure to releive itself back into the sump.
This valve holds the pressure more or less steady at all RPM.

If the first is stuck open you will get excessive oil temps.
If the first is stuck closed then you will get expensive noises due to lack 
of oiling at the bearings on start-up from cold.
If the second is stuck open then you will have oil pressure changing in 
proportion to RPM and a possible flickering oil light at low RPM.
If the second is stuck closed then you will have permanently high oil 
pressure in the system resulting in early failure of the seals between engine 
and oil cooler.

So it clear that they should be working properly.

But where are these releife valves?

If you look at the bottom (sump) of the engine then one valve can be seen at 
the back edge of the bottom and the other at the front edge of the bottom 
both right next to the join between the crank case halfs. They will look like 
the heads of screws only about 20mm in diameter.
A single relief engine will only have one (not sure which) of these.

If you undo these then a small amount of oil will come out and there will be 
a spring (NB the springs are different lengths so dont mix them up) and a 
plunger â€” the plunger will move freely and should drop out. It may be 
encouraged to come out by VERY BRIEFLY cranking the engine (but don't do that 
if you've just drained the oil). The plungers are cheep and a scored plunger 
should be replaced.

Re your mystery hoses 

&gt;From your description it would seem that your engine had been converted to 
use an external oil cooler and/or oil filter - so putting an oil filter here 
will do more good than harm.

When this conversion is done there is usually one tube from the oil plate 
cover, the exit from the oil pump to the oil galleries is blocked and the oil 
is returned via a new gallery in the region of the oil pressure sensor.

I suspect from your description that your dreaded PO hasn't done this quite 
properly in that if the outlet from the oil pump was fully blocked and you 
had plugged the extra tubes then your engine would be totaly starved of oil 
and would wreck itself extremely quickly.

When the tubes were blocked off the oil was trying to pass a restriction in 
the pump outlet which would cause low pressure on the other side of the 
restriction and therefore the low pressure light would come on.

Reconnecting the tubes would allow a fuller flow of oil into the normal 
system via this second route - therefore the low pressure light will stay off

If my explanation based on your description is correct then you should keep 
the oil filter there and it is definitely doing some good.

Hope that helps
