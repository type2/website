Subject: Re: [T2] Need a decel valve

Huh...I havnt heard anything about bankruptcy. Better get my order in. But
the part was cheaper than from Partsamerica. The part is $119 from RMMW and
$156 from PA. For a part that hard to find I can handle $119. I will say
that their prices are a bit on the high side in general though.

&gt; If those are the right item, let me know, please and I will buy one too
for
&gt; spare. They are like, totally unavailable.
&gt; I was just at a local parts house and I heard one of the key people
talking
&gt; about RMMW with a customer. They were saying that they have filed for
&gt; bankruptcy court. They are also saying that the parts were notoriously
&gt; expensive. Do you mind if I ask what you paid?
