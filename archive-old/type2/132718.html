Subject: Re: [T2] Rear bumper removal

Hi Alan,

I have had plenty of bumper-removal thrills...

It's usually a very simple job, just like Mike said -- loosen 4 bolts 
and watch out because the bumper will be dropping on your toes.

The only complication can occur if the captive nuts welded to the 
inside of the frame rail break away from the frame due to being 
over-torqued by a rusted bolt. This was a common occurence on my 
previous westy. (God rest its soul). If this has happened to you then I 
would suggest you try to jam the nut in place with a large screwdriver 
inserted into the end of the frame rail between the nut and the frame 
rail.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
