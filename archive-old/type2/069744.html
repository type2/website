Subject: Re: Sunroof cover advice needed.

&gt;I need to know what experiences others have had with different 
&gt;types of sunroof covers.  A friend with a 23 has a canvas top 
&gt;that he refuses to drive if there is any chance of rain.  He said 
&gt;it leaked from the day he installed it.  I am probably going to go 
&gt;with white vinyl.  What suppliers have others used and how was the 
&gt;quality of materials, fit &amp; finish, etc.?

I have gone thru 2 sunroof covers.  The first was from WCM, which was
actually really nice.  I used vinyl, after discussion on the list and with
locals on the good and bad of both.  I tore holes in it pushing the bus
(engine-less = taller) into the garage one morning to work on it, and it
scraped against the garage door.

I replaced it with one from TMI.  My beef with this cover is the holes they
pop in the rear section for the clamping bar were huge, and IMHO, not in the
right place.  The other one just had colored marks  where it suggested you
put the holes.

Leakwise, both of them have been the same.  The only time I get leaks is
when I wash it, and water get pushed _up_ against the sunroof instead of down.
