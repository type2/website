Subject: RE: [T2] Brazilian cab gaskets

Ronnie said:

&gt; You would be amazed at how many of your so called German gaskets are
&gt; actually Brazil or Mexico (even India) repackaged or just called German...

In addition, German rubber isn't exactly the best available.  It is adequate, but it seems that the stuff that comes on American and 
Japanese cars is much more resistant to UV and ozone deterioration.  I think the important thing is the molding and formulation, not 
where the rubber was made.  We lean on guys like Ronnie to do our research for us so we don't get stung with the junk.
