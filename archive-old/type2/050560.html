Subject: [T2] Shifter adjustment: Bentley shop manual misleads again...

This past weekend Dan (near Seattle) wrote inquiring about poor shift 
quality after replacing the rear coupler, and wondered how important was the 
adjustment of stop plate of the gear shift lever in his '74 van. Well it 
appears that once again the figures in the Bentley manual faked out another 
owner. Those who read this would be well-advised to check their copy and 
label the drawing for future reference. In my version, covering '68-'76, 
figure 3-17 and 3-18 in section 6 show the shift rod (photo) and its 
underlying stop plate mechanism (drawing). The mislead is that the drawing 
is a view from the reverse perspective  of that in the photograph, so if you 
don't notice that you'll push the stop plate in the wrong direction, 
resulting in poor alignment and crummy shift action. As soon as I noticed 
that, I wrote a note on drawing 3-18 as a reminder. The correct direction to 
push the slide plate, after having engaged 2nd gear, is from left to right 
(e.g. toward the passenger seat). I think I wrote about this some time ago; 
maybe it needs to be added to the archive?
