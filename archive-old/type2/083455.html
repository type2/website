&gt; Yes!!  I've always wondered how some people can claim they removed/
&gt; installed their type4 engine with the tranny in place and fan housing
&gt; attached.  I've NEVER been able to do that.  Back before I started
&gt; dropping engine/tranny together, I used to install the engine as
&gt; a long block (with cylinder covers, minus rear tin, fan housing,
&gt; alternator, exhaust, etc.) to get the clearance I needed.  Even then
&gt; it was a struggle.
&gt;
&gt; Tyler, I really doubt that the transaxle's input shaft is coming out -
&gt; you just need more clearance, clarence.  :)

Drat!  went to bed too early and missed the excitement.  Back before I
stopped pulling the engine alone, I had this problem as well.  I *did* get
the engine alone out a couple times, but:
the rear tin had to come off,
the oil had to come out,
the oil fill pipe had to come off the block, and
the engine had to be tilted a bit.
It is an extremely tight fit in there to get the engine off the input
shaft and I would swear that I moved the clutch disc in the sandwich a
time or two.
