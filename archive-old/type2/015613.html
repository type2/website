Use Mahle/Kneckt/MANN filters. I do think you have the right filter,
otherwise the commomly available filter is the Makle 0C-108. (From memory
so verify that. I don't have the books here at home.) They are unique to
this very particular motor, an integral part of the lubrication system, the
life-blood of your engine. Use only OEM filters in this case, regardless
the price.

The Bosch brand oil filters are latter day items designed to compete with
the bottom feeder market and bump up the margins based upon an otherwise
good name.  Indeed, it just may have been put on too tight and fouled the
seal. Also, there is an oil cooler above the filter.  Install the new
filter. Repeat your observation test. Report if still leaking.

&gt;Hello,
&gt;changed the oil filter. They put a MANN W920/17 Filter on. Does anyone
have any
&gt;ideas whether or not this filter is compatible? Is it possible to get a bad
&gt;filter at times, or has it been seated poorly (like they forgot to put oil on
&gt;the rubber rim before scewing it in). I also checked to make sure that the
&gt;filter is tight and it is real tight.  I am definately going to take it out,
&gt;clean the area, and put in a new one in. Any suggestions on a perhaps,
ohhhh, I
&gt;don't know..........A friggin BOSCH!! oil filter perhaps.
