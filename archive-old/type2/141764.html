Subject: Re:Fuel tank cleanout -old gas ridding

George said...&quot;Now, what to do with four gallons of stale and dirty gas&quot;

That's the reason that I used alcohol when I flushed out the tank on our 71.
I just set the bucket aside someplace safe and before long all the alcohol
had evaporated, problem solved.  The gas that I drained out of the tank
before the flush went into a 5 gallon can and was used in our lawn mower and
chain saw without a problem.
