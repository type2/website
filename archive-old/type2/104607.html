&gt; &gt; Last night we were scraping crud off the engine case when we noticed
&gt; &gt; that there was some play in the rod bearings. Each of the the pistons
&gt; &gt; will swing about 2-3 mm of arc in the direction of  the crank. It also
&gt; &gt; slides fore-and-aft on the cam bearing slightly, but what concerns me
&gt; &gt; is the rotation.

&gt; Without splitting the case you can measure crankshaft end play and rod
&gt; journal side clearance and that is about it.

&gt; You can't check the other bearings but if the engine is out
&gt; and partly taken apart, I see no reason to stop tearing it down, in fact I
&gt; would say you'd be foolish NOT to tear it down completely.

Rods can be removed for bearing examination
without splitting the case if the cylinders are off.
Endplay off spec is an indication of main bearing wear.
We think you are begging for a reason to go in there:)
Drop a wrench in it.
