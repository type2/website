HELLO GUYS

Please excuse the intrusion, but I REALLY NEED HELP!!!!! My 
man and I are 
busy converting a 1974 (or thereabouts) VW Kombi from air to 
water cooled. 
Our problems are:

a) hooter wont stop hooting - suspect wiring is earthing in 
the steering 
column but cannot get it apart to check.

b) flickers (indicators) wont work although hazards do. 
Checked the unit 
which seems fine. 

We have been unsuccessful in begging or borrowing and even 
considered 
stealing wiring diagrams and so forth but to no avail, it's a 
bit hard to 
steal what's not available for begging or borrowing. We have 
had the 
occasional offer of &quot;yeah well I can fix this for a price...&quot; 
but that 
defeats the object.

If you can point me in any helpful direction or if you can 
help in any way 
we would surely appreciate it.

Many thanks

Kim and Neil
