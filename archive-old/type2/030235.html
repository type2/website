&gt; well, the bus failed safety inspection...badly i might add.

Need to add the parts.

&gt; some bushing between the steering column and the gearbox is damaged.

Probably the flex coupling between the shaft and the steering gearbox.
Replace.

&gt; the master cylinder (that i just replaced with a remanuf. one) is leaking 
&gt; somewhere.
&gt; the rear wheel brake cylinder (which i also replaced) is leaking.

Track 'em down...

&gt; the is a leak in the exhaust.

?  Just about every possible leak point is further back than many exhaust
pipe outlets on conventional cars.
&gt; 
&gt; and get this...he said that 1 out of 4 side marker lights is 
&gt; working.  well, as far as i know, the front door markers are solely 
&gt; reflectors, the rear ones have lights.  it is clear (since the door panels 
&gt; are off) that there is no electrical wires in the vicinity of these 
&gt; reflectors....whatever.

They are.  The turn signals also shine to the side and meet the legal
requirement for side markers.

&gt; i have already removed the rear brake 3 times in this process.  the wheel 
&gt; cylinders in the rear were brand new.  unfortunately, i tore a hole in the 
&gt; dust covers in the process of installing the new shoes.  i also pushed the 
&gt; cylinder past the valve and caused the cylinder to collect fluid in the 
&gt; dust cover.  i took it apart on sunday because...i was rechecking the 
&gt; brakes and nothing in there was dry after driving it for 20 miles.  the 
&gt; pass. side was fine.

You might just have some residual oil dripping out.  Clean things up.


&gt; i have no clue as to what the guy is referring to in the steering.  my 
&gt; better half took the vehicle for the inspection...so no arguements involved 
&gt; on my part.

He was probably referring to the flexible coupling.  It is replacable and
available from bus suppliers, AFAIK.

It sounds like the &quot;inspector&quot; is not knowledgable about VWs and less than
sympathetic.  You might want to consider taking it somewhere else if you
have the option.
