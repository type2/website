Subject: Type of dog house cooler seal to use???

Hello List,

I have a quick question. I was installing the dog
house oil cooler on my new engine. Are the rubber
seals that go between the oil cooler and the oil
cooler mount the same as the seals that go between the
mount and the case? I used the same seal on both. Will
this cause a problem. Not till after I sealed up the
shroud did I notice that there were 2 similiar seals.
The only difference between the 2 was that one was
taller than the other. I heard a rumor that if the
wrong seal is used, the seal can swell up blocking oil
flow through the coil. Please let me know as I don't
want to cook my new engine. (especially since I have
spent all the time and money on putting together a
working thermostat settup!) Thanks!

Regards,
David Kelly
