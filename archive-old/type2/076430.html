Subject: Re: [T2] Parcel Tray info wanted



&gt; 
&gt; Hello all,
&gt; I was planning on making my own Parcel Tray in my '72 Westy (can't 
afford $160 for a new set. 
&gt; http://www.bus-boys_dot_com/bbaccess.htm#parcel ) but I lack specific 
details on the making of said 
&gt; tray.  More specifically, I need dimensions.  Width, length, length 
and placement of brackets, 
&gt; that type of thing.  But if someone has detailed pictures or 
descriptions or even a copy of the 
&gt; installation instructions, that would be helpful. 

Next time mine are out I'll put together a full description.  For those 
who cannot wait, just get a piece of cardboard and make a pattern to 
meet your needs.  I used 1/4 masonite for the shelves with a 1/2 x 1 
inch pine strip as the lip.  Cover with naugahyde or whatever you 
please.  The shelves are mirror-images of each other, so once you get 
one done (I suggest you start with the driver's side) you can simply 
flip it over for the other side.

My &quot;brackets&quot; are simply hooks bent from 1/8 welding rod that attach to 
existing screws in the vent ducts and e-brake hanger.  The outboard aft 
hooks are simply double-ended hooks as there are no screws here, but 
there is a lip under the dash.
