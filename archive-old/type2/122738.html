Subject: Question -- and short rant -- about archive

The question:

How often is the archive updated and indexed??

The rant:
&lt;rant&gt;
There was recently a mercifully short mini-flame war about people who post
asking questions about things which have been answered recently.

MikeL asked about storing a bay windshield -- I *KNEW* there had been a
thread on this because I had replied (noting the two I have stored at
home).

So, I went to the archive search page hoping to simply send him a link with
the proper search terms. 45 minutes later I was getting unhappy.

So, I reverted to my own archive. Using some of the same search terms I had
the thread pinpointed in about 10 minutes. It started on 1/14/2004 and
ended on 1/15/2004.

As is often the case, the subject of the messages had nothing to do with
the content. The initial message asking info on storing windshields had a
subject of &quot;kids, don't try this at home&quot;. And the subject morphed through
replies into &quot;Longterm windscreen storage&quot; and there were some in the
thread with the old &quot;Digest xxx-xxx-xxx&quot; subject.

But he body text DID have the words &quot;store&quot; and &quot;windshield&quot; in it. So, I
figured the online archive used some sort of search indexing that wasn't
doing a full body search. 

I went back to the online archive -- still intending to send just a link to
the list. Did a search using the original subject. Still no joy. And it
seemed that the newest messages I was finding with ANY search were from
some time in November of last year. So I searched on my domain name to see
if any of my messages were in there since I sgned on to the list on 11/21
and first posted on 11/22. -- Nope, not there. Picked on Dave Bolen as
another test search because of his unique email address and the newest
message I found was from 11/16.

So, before we get upset at people asking about something that &quot;was just
covered last month&quot; perhaps we should try to locate relevant entries n the
archives ourselves. It might not be there yet and the poster, like most
people, probably deletes messages from their own machine as they are read
and didn't memorize the content of each one before hitting the big red X.

Me, I'm anal enough about my email that I have a full blown mail server set
up at home and have some email archived as far back as 1996. &lt;grin&gt;

The archives take maintenance -- that takes time -- the
moderators/maintainers have day jobs -- there will be delays -- be happy --
don't worry ----- oops, got carried away. :-)

If someone posts a FART then go find it in the archives and post a short
message back to the list with a link to your search. It's quicker than
griping about an old thread being covered again.

&lt;/rant&gt;

Oh, I pulled the most relevant messages from the thread on storing glass
out of my archive and sent them on to MikeL.
