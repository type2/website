&gt; Well it's nearly two weeks since my Leisel started and I've replaced the
&gt; following: coil, plugs(twice), rotor, distributor, points, condensor,
&gt; plug wires, and distributor cap. Also put in another double relay...

Let's see, I haven't been following your earlier posts (if any). Sounds
like the starter works and you can turn it over, but you can't get a
start? And you've been all over the ignition system? A couple of things
come to mind:

1- It is possible to get the distributor in backwards. I don't exactly
remember the details, but I've heard of the problem and I even did it once
myself. If you've had the distributor out (to replace points, for example)
and have been turning your engine over by hand (for example to adjust the
valves), you might have this problem. The spark would fire at the wrong
part of the cycle and it would not start. Checkyour manual and check to be
sure that cylinder #1 is in fact at top dead center when it's supposed to
be.

2- Next is the fuel system. You've already replaced the double relay which
provides power to the fuel pump. If car has been sitting for a year you
should definitely replace the fuel filter. Got gas in the tank? The fuel
pump could be bad too.  I've heard that banging on it can temporarily
restore function. You can lie under the car and have someone else turn the
key while you listen to the fuel pump. I'm told you should hear a hum from
it if it is getting power and working. You could brush up the connectors
to the leads that go to the double relay and brush up the connectors that
power the fuel pump. You could have someone turn the key while you check
with a voltmeter for 12 volts at the hot wire to the fuel pump. I recently
replaced the fuel pump on my '78 and solved a world of intermittent &quot;won't
start&quot; problems. But it cost something close to a hundred bucks, as I
recall, so do the fuel filter first.

Then there are the injectors to consider and the cold start valve and
injector. It's hard to imagine that they could all poop out at once
though. Review procedures for checking the spray from injectors. They do
get gunked up and they do fail from time to time.

Good luck. Perseverence furthers.
