Subject: Re: [T2] stripped exhaust header bolt/case threads

Hi, James...  I cannot see your email address, so I have to ask you up 
front, where are you hailing from???

I ask this because you talk about a type IV 1700 Fuel Injected engine, and I 
am sure you have a story on that setup you couuld share.

Your first post said &quot;I believe one of the bolts has stripped the threads in 
the case (header/exhaust bolts)&quot;  Are you talking about a BOLT or a STUD??  
Is the potentially stripped threads in the HEADS or the CASE??

You say in the second posting &quot; The holes in the case where the header 
attaches.&quot;  I think the headers attach to the heads; the headers do not 
attach to the  case.  If you are talking about the heads vice headers, then 
the heads attach to the case with LONGGGG studs.  A STUD has threads at both 
ends, and a BOLT has threads on only one end [with a fixed fastener on the 
other end,]


As long as you have some thread, you should be able to have it tapped for 
another half dozen threads deep to give you more bite to your bolt/stud.

Don't be reluctant to pay your guru, because they have to pay the rent, 
too!!   There are many reasons to do the job yourself, and probably the 
BIGGEST reason is because when you and I can do as good a job as well as our 
local VW guru, at least we KNOW WHATwas done.
