Subject: Re: [T2] 78 Dash

Hi Frank,

Quarter inch aperature approximately centered under the glove box, 
right?

That's a european 12V accessory outlet.  I'm told higher-end BMW 
touring motorcycles share the same system. Jamie Rivers has a original 
Coleman 12V air compressor that plugs into it, it's the only accessory 
I have ever seen for that plug.

Happy trails,

&gt; Hello All knowing,
&gt; On the passenger side of the dash, far right, there is a receptacle of 
&gt; some
&gt; sort.  I have seen it in others, it is factory.
&gt; Can anyone tell me what it is for?
