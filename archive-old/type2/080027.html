Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Looking for the widest tire- load ratings and Coopers

Settlements are often made solely due to the cost
of litigation, which can literally be millions of
dollars.  For example:  have you heard of iron
companies paying settling and putting labels on
there irons that say &quot;don't iron with your
clothes on.&quot;  I don't get concerned unless some
independent agency like NHTSA finds some problem,
and even NHTSA responds to some very isolated
problems.    

If our current products liability laws were in
place at the time many current products came onto
the market, automobiles and household electrical
and heating systems would have been found too
unsafe to be introduced into the market.  

Again VW has settled far more suits than Cooper
and was the target of a campaign by Nader and
NHTSA, yet I hazard to guess that most of us see
that VW's are safe given even a small amount of
intellect to use the vehicles within reasonable
operating habits.

&gt; Now if a 'proposed settlement' is

&gt; that 'being sued' implies?
