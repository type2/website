Subject: Urethane bushings going going gone

I've been having a devil of a time locating urethane sway bar bushings. It seems that Bugpack/Prothane are phasing out the 7/8&quot; HD bushings for front and rear 68-79 sway bars.

Does anyone know an alternate source? There is stock on hand at some vendors but when this is exhausted (very soon) there will be no more.
