For those who don't check newsgroups, this might be of interest. Also, I
just picked up a 23-window double-door barndoor deluxe running, original,
and complete for $150. (Sorry, guess I'm supposed to hold off on this stuff
'til Friday....now back to reality.  ;) Joe

&gt;VOLKSWAGEN'S NAZI PAST MAY BE
&gt;BAD FOR BUSINESS
&gt;
&gt;New Book Details auto company's use 
&gt;of slave labor
&gt;
&gt;By Terrence Petty, Associated Press
&gt;
&gt;Bonn, Germany- It's no sec-
&gt;ret that Adolf Hitler master-
&gt;minded the Volkswagen Beetle
&gt;- the affordable &quot;people's car.&quot; 
&gt;So in the spirit of  open-
&gt;ness about its Nazi past,
&gt;Volkswagen paid $2 million
&gt;for one of Germany's most re-
&gt;spected historians to write a
&gt;book about it.
&gt;Ten years later the book is 
&gt;out- but Europe's biggest car
&gt;maker is wondering if it's good
&gt;intentions are going to hurt
&gt;its business.
&gt;&quot;Volkswagen and Its Work-
&gt;ers During the Third Reich,&quot;
&gt;by Hans Mommsen, has re-
&gt;newed discussion of VW's
&gt;use of slave labor during World
&gt;War II.  Complete with photos
&gt;of Der Fuehrer admiring a
&gt;Beetle model, it is the most
&gt;comprehensive- and poten-
&gt;tially damaging- history ever
&gt;written about the Nazi-era 
&gt;birth of the company.
&gt;Chapter after chapter details
&gt;how Volkswagen manufac-
&gt;tured hardware for the Nazi
&gt;war machine using slave la-
&gt;borers- Jews, Russians, Poles,
&gt;and others.  Many were former
&gt;inmates of concentration
&gt;camps.  Some laborers were
&gt;beaten, some were worked to
&gt;death.
&gt;The book says Volkswagen 
&gt;founder Ferdinand Porsche,
&gt;Nazi party member and grand-
&gt;father of current VW chairman
&gt;Ferdinand Piech, was &quot;morally
&gt;indifferent&quot; to slave laborers'
&gt;misery.
&gt;&quot;Porsche walked through
&gt;these crimes like a sleep-
&gt;walker,&quot; writes Mommsen,
&gt;who paints a more damning
&gt;portrait of the industrialist 
&gt;than any previous account.
&gt;The German news magazine
&gt;Der Spiegel has said that  Fer-
&gt;dinand Piech is upset about the
&gt;book's negative portrayal-
&gt;not only of his grandfather but
&gt;also of his father, Anton Piech,
&gt;VW's chief executive during 
&gt;the war.
&gt;Volkswagen also is appar-
&gt;ently concerned that General
&gt;Motors Corp. could use the
&gt;book as a public relations
&gt;weapon on its battles with VW,
&gt;Der Spiegel reported.  The U.S.
&gt;car maker has accused Volks-
&gt;wagen of stealing GM secrets,
&gt;a case currently in Detroit's U.S.
&gt;District Court.
&gt;The Volkswagen story starts
&gt;in the 1930s, when Hitler called
&gt;for production of a &quot;people's
&gt;car&quot;- what &quot;Volkswagen&quot;
&gt;means in English.  The idea was to
&gt;do for Germany what Henry Ford
&gt;did for Americans:  make a car 
&gt;affordable to average people.
&gt;Porsche traveled to Ford's Detroit
&gt;plant in 1936 and was impressed by
&gt;the American car maker's assembly
&gt;line and hard workers, the book 
&gt;says.  He hired about 20 American
&gt;automotive technicians of German
&gt;origin, most of them Ford employees.
&gt;And with Nazi banners fluttering
&gt;and Hitler beaming at Porsche's
&gt;side, the cornerstone for the Volks-
&gt;wagen factory was laid on May 26,
&gt;1938.
&gt;But World War II interrupted 
&gt;plans for the &quot;people's car&quot; as VW
&gt;joined other manufacturers in pro-
&gt;ducing armaments, including V-1
&gt;rockets, warplanes, bazookas, 
&gt;and bombs.
&gt;During the war, about three-
&gt;quarters of Volkswagen's workers
&gt;were foreigners.  The first were Ita-
&gt;lians, who built the Volkswagen 
&gt;plants.  Because they came from an
&gt;allied country, the Italians were
&gt;paid twice what they could have
&gt;earned at home and were  treated to
&gt;Italian films and plays, Mommsen writes.
&gt;Slave laborers were kept in bar-
&gt;racks surrounded by barbed wire.  In
&gt;addition to former concentration
&gt;camp inmates,  the workers were
&gt;prisoners of war and civilians taken
&gt;from their homes in Eastern Europe
&gt;and the Soviet Union.
&gt;Guards beat those who grabbed
&gt;for bread or potato peels lying on the
&gt;floor, Mommsen claims.  Soviet sol-
&gt;diers and Jews were treated espe-
&gt;cially brutally: &quot;The Russians were
&gt;constantly suffering from hunger.
&gt;The company kitchen delivered
&gt;hardly anything other than turnips.&quot;
&gt;According to the book, about 120
&gt;Soviet POWs were delivered to
&gt;Volkswagen plants by the end of
&gt;1941.  Twenty-seven of them died
&gt;there.
&gt;It is impossible to say how many 
&gt;slave laborers were put to work by
&gt;Volkswagen because they were
&gt;viewed as &quot;second-class people&quot;
&gt;whose employment wasn't deemed
&gt;worth documenting, the authors say.
&gt;ECON Verlagsgruppe, publisher 
&gt;of the book, says there are no plans 
&gt;yet for an English translation.
