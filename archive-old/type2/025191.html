Subject: WTB: Used Rear Tranny Mount(s) &amp; Heater Flaps ('72)
Message-ID: &lt;AEJHGLIBEGLOCAAA_at_theglobe_dot_com&gt;

If you're parting out a '72-79 bus, please consider selling me your old rear (back of bus) tranny mounts...the rubber cylindrical mounts that attach to the bracket that attaches to the tranny.

I've found that these parts are NLA. I have an e-mail into the OE manufacturer, but I expect that to take some time...and I'll be generous in sharing info and access when/if that pans out.

I also need heater flappers to connect my '72 heat exchangers with the bellows that come off the heating system. If these have gasket in place, that's all the better, as the gaskets are also NLA, as far as I can tell.

Thanks for any help you can offer! 

Joe (nearing the tail end of this bus ressurection...there's still some tunnel left, but the light's *starting* to show)
