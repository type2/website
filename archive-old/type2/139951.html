Subject: Oil Leaking out of my 69 Westy

 &gt;This week, while driving to and from my store, I have noticed oil
 &gt;leaking...not a whole lot, maybe a few table spoons worth...and the
 &gt;engine, under acceleration, sounds a bit &quot;louder&quot; than I remember.
 &gt;While accelerating, it makes a loud &quot;brappppppppp&quot; sound. I thought it
 &gt;was exhaust related, but found no evidence of this.

 &gt;I was wondering if the engine sound and oil leak might be related?

It sounds to me like a loose head.

Symptom #1	If the oil seems to be leaking from either end of the 
pushrod tube(s) underneath the cylinders (but above the tin).

Symptom #2	The sound you describe under load would be a leak around the 
cylinder heads.

Symptom #3	Test the valve clearance.  If it is tight (or gone), it's a 
safe bet that the head needs to be re-torqued.  The engine will need to 
be dropped and the tin removed to do this.
