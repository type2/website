Subject: Re: [T2] painting engine tin

As I just found in my hellish painting experience, don't use the hi-temp 
stuff, at least not for the regular tin.  It is a matte black and it 
does not clean up easily if you get oil and grime on it.  Also, it is 
not very strong and can get scraped off somewhat easily.  It is not 
resiliant to gas or other solvents (strips right off).

After I painted *all* my tin using the hi-temp, I ended up paiting it 
all again using rustoleum enamel and the finish came out pretty nice. 
It is relatively durable, should be able to withstand the engine heat, 
and it also resists solvents better.

If you have never painted with an enamel, be very patient!  Paint it and 
get a nice coating, but not too much, or you get nasty dribbles.  Once 
you coat it, let it dry for 48 hours in a warm room.  DO NOT recoat 
within that 48 hour period or it'll get all funky on you and you'll just 
get frustrated (sounds like one of those &quot;ask me how I know stories&quot; eh?).

btw, I sand-blasted all the parts before painting.  Probably one of the 
best methods to clean up the old paint and rust.

What heat exchanger holes in the tin are you talking about?

good luck,
Mike

&gt; Hey guys,
&gt; 
&gt;         Another quick question. The engine tin that I have is a little
&gt; rusty, and doesn't look all that great. Is there a particular paint I can
&gt; use? Or can I just use regular black engine block hi-temp paint? 
&gt; 
&gt; Also, for the heat exchanger holes in the tin, is there some sort of an
&gt; aluminum plug I can just stick in place?
