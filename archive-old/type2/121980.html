&gt;Hi,  Awhile back I thought i had heard someone mention a source for the
&gt;correct metric
&gt;copper nuts for the exhaust (M8X1.25) I having no luck finding a source.
&gt;I think it was an online
&gt;bolt/nut store but none of these stores seem to sell copper nuts. I've
&gt;looked at boltdepot_dot_com and
&gt;sent them an email but Ihaven't heard back yet.  Where have you bought
&gt;these?

For the exhaust studs? Those are at Bus Boys:

Copper Nut, 8mm, Exhaust Port, All  $0.25
