Subject: Re: [T2] respirator for sandblasting?

Howdy,
Thanks for your response, but I didn't mean I was going to use a paper mask - 
I meant PAPR - Positive Air Pressure Respirator. It has a battery powered 
pump, three filters and a hood, but not an entire suit. It is not a supplied 
air system, but it is positive pressure. The Pf (protection factor)is 1000.  
It is not as good as a suit, I'm sure, but It will have to do, I guess.  The 
unit was more expensive than my sandblaster.
Is a P3 HEPA filter best?

Thanks,
Jen

&gt; Most sandblasters use an entire hooded suit ventilated with a 
&gt; compressed air hose to keep a slight positive pressure inside the 
&gt; suit and push out any particulate matter before it gets into the 
&gt; lungs. A simple paper mask isn't good enough. Usual complex 
&gt; respirators for paint and the like wind up getting clogged with the 
&gt; dust and are rendered useless.
