Hi,

What's the best/safest way to clean a light covering of old moss/dirt off
the top of a Westy fiberglass pop-top?

- What kind of cleaner will neutralize the moss/remove it cleanly?

- What other &quot;tools&quot; can safely be used in conjunction with the cleaner
without damaging the top?

- Any &quot;whiteners&quot; or &quot;brighteners&quot; available for fiberglass tops like the
Westy's?

Thanks in advance- by the way, this &quot;Westy&quot; is for sale.. Just has a tad bit
of old Oregon moss on it that needs removing is all..

Chris..
