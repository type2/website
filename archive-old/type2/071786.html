Subject: Deciphering my M plate
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

Hi all
   I am in the midst of trying to decipher my M plate. Here are the numbers:
    30 8
    518
    21 426 B67 507 517
    UN 2310 523907 9015346

    This is in a 69 Bus, Non westy solid roof  passenger bus.
   I know that the &quot;30 8&quot; is the projected build date, and I have figured out 
most of the M codes.  But is there a way to get the paint codes out of the 
other numbers?  My bus is currently the wrong color, an odd grey that VW 
didn't even offer.  Also, the interior is 2 different shades of blue. The 
roof may be the only original paint on this thing- that is white.
    I have tried several resources, they all give me &quot;L&quot; numbers for paint 
codes to look up- Is there another plate that I need to look at? I think the 
&quot;L&quot; numbers were for splitties?
    Anyone know of a site or book with the Bay paint codes otherwise?
   FWIW- the dechipering I have done so far came from the type2_dot_com site, as 
well as the book  &quot;The Original VW Bus&quot; by Laurence Meredith.   Both good 
resources.

   Thanks
  Brian
