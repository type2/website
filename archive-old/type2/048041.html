Subject: [T2] how the heck do I get to my #3 cylinder head?

Hi everyone--
Thanks to all those who responded to my '77 Westy choking problem.  Now for 
a question that's going to show my true green-horn abilities=)  How do I get 
to my #3 cylinder head to remove my temp. sensor II?  Thanks a lot all,
Chet
