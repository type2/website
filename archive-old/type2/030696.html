I have a 71 Westy, that has a camper top that needs some attention...
The Top is solid, but the fiberglass has start to peel up and is just not
pretty to look at... Can this be sanded and painted, or is there a better
process to under take? I'm planning on removing it so that I can paint the
entire bus (if you're gonna do it, do it right) so sending it to a shop
would only be a matter of $$$, but what isn't?
