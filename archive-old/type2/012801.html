&gt;Hi folks,
&gt;   I'd like to be able to tow a small trailer with our 71 westy.  What does 
&gt;a trailer hitch for an early bay look like?  A verbal desciption would be 
&gt;great, a scetch even better, and a hitch to sell to me would be great.  I'm 
&gt;just looking to tow a small trailer to carry some bicycles.  Since the bikes 
&gt;are tandems a regular type of bike rack is out.

The first site, hitch-web_dot_com, only shows a hitch down to '73, '72 and 
earlier they claim to have nothing and invite you to call for a custom 
solution. But, since '72 was the first of the type4s, that verdict is 
suspect. Further, since the original poster says the manufacturer(Dalan) 
was good to him, I'd say give 'em a call and see what they say-their web 
page is remarkably devoid of any useful information. Further seraches of 
the archives may yeild more info, this was hit # 4 out of 153 on a search 
for &quot;trailer hitch&quot;.


Peace,
