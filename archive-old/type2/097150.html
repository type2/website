Subject: Acces to the ignition switch

Hello Volks

My first question of the year, somebody out there knows how I can disassembly
the upper part of the steering column in order to get the ignition switch
out.
I am already take out the steering wheel, turn signal and wipers assemblies
but could not move the plastic sleeve that cover the column and the switch.

Thanks in advance

From the sunny lands of Caracas Venezuela

Roberto
