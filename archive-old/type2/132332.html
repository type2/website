&gt; After thinking about this for a while, Scott, I have to wonder whether
&gt; what counts as a &quot;must&quot; for someone who builds a lot of engines is
&gt; quite a bit different from what counts as a &quot;must&quot; for someone who does
&gt; it only once, or twice.

I think when Scott says must he's implying it's an incredible convenience. I
detailed my engine while it sat on my atv jack and a wooden pallet. I did a
lot of lying on the ground with shop lights and I probably wouldn't do it
that way again.

If you think you'll be a 1-time engine builder, sell the setup afterwards to
some other 1-time builder and consider the small loss a rental fee for the
convenience.
