Subject: Riviera Water Tank

I have a 1971 Riviera conversion. It has a water tank tucked behind the ice
box. Originally it had an electric pump. Something had passed away in this
system.

Has anyone taken one of these apart? I've found no repair documentation for
it. Only for Westfalia tanks.

Can these be fixed. Is there a fuse somewhere? I was thinking of replacing
it with a hand pump unit. Maybe one out of a Westfalia unit if possible.
Before I tear into it blindly I just wanted to see if anyone has attempted
this.

One other related question. The drain for that tank is a terrible design.
It's a clamping device that squeezes the plastic tube dropping out of the
bottom of the bus. After awhile this clamp cracks the hose and you have to
cut the hose and move the clamp up.

Does anyone know of an inline valve affair that could be used instead?
