Subject: Re: [T2] VW engine swap

Tony sends:

&gt; ...Now that VW owns Rolls-Royce, what would be the availability (Ron,
&gt; BusDepot?), of a conversion kit for the Merlin engine into my Bus?

Are you going to build a little doghouse coming out the back of the Bus to
house it, or turn the transaxle around, relocate the gas tank to where the
VW engine was and make your passengers sit on the engine? A Merlin is just a
touch longer than a Type 4 engine!

Now, a little turboshaft out of a Jet Ranger or a Hughes 500, that has
possibilities. No worries about tin, runs real clean (and on kerosene, no
less!), real nice acceleration. You'd have to rig up a jackshaft to go
between the engine and the transmission. And the torque is just a bit
lacking, but a 200-250hp Lycoming or AiResearch turboshaft would compensate
for low torque with plenty of horsepower.
