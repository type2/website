Subject: dipstick tube length

Hi all,

Hope this wasn't covered in the recent lengthy dipstick exchanges.  I had to 
modify the tube set-up on my '79 bus.  Accordingly, the marks on the 
dipstick no longer represent the true oil level.  Does anyone have a 
measurement from the top of the dipstick tube to the bottom of the crankcase 
(In other words, the length of a rod pushed down into the dipstick tube 
until it bottomed out).  If I had this measurement I could make the 
appropriate corrections.

Thanks in advance for the info, and saving me a muddy trip to the junkard to 
make the measurement myself.
