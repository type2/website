Subject: Re: [T2] rear hatch window installation

Joel:

For the rear hatch glass, you definitely need someone on the outside pushing the glass in.  The front windshield can be installed solo, but the rear hatch glass is inset from the surface of the hatch.  As for whether to start from the bottom or top, it doesn't really matter, as long as your pushing partner keeps even pressure on the glass.

 of course i am using the standard &quot;wire in the outer groove&quot; trick
&gt;with a little soap for lube.
&gt;
&gt;for those that have replaced this seal, would working for top-to-bottom or
&gt;bottom-to-top be the best method? does that even matter?
&gt;
&gt;searched the archives on this &amp; didnt really learn anything specific about
&gt;installing the rear window. the seal fits nicely around the glass, i just
&gt;can't figure out what i'm doing wrong on the installation.
&gt;
&gt;any tips or hints would really be great.  it's not supposed to rain here
&gt;again until Friday, so i figure i've got a couple more days to get the
&gt;window in.
&gt;
&gt;TIA.
