Subject: Re: [T2] brake upgrade on a '72 westy

There are two different types of front brakes on the newer bay's.   
'71-'72 and '73-'79.

The backing plates are different between the '71-'72 and the '73+  
front brakes.  I have a set of backing plates for the '71-'72 that I  
will give away for the cost of shipping.

This I know:

the steering knuckle is different, this is the biggest thing to  
change out to make the upgrade
the spindle is the same (85% sure)
rotors are different
calipers are different
the pads are different
backing plates are different
wheel bearing is the same (85% sure)

The only difference is the thickness of the pads.  The newer ones are  
thicker, allowing one to go farther between replacement.
