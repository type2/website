Subject: Brake adjustment..

Out of adjustment wheels can seem like a bleeding problem.  I think five clicks
of the stars is too many...I usually back them off just as little as neccessary
to let the wheels turn freely.  Did you also adjust the front wheels...All of
the wheels need to be  adjusted before you start bleeding.  I have several times
thought I had a bleeding problem and it turned out that a few clicks of the
stars all around was all that was needed to get things tip top....John Jensen in
