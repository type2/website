Subject: Re: [T2] Warning - Schadek oil pump on Vanagon - no go

John, my message was one of frustration and not blame.  I now have 
another type IV pump so my frustration is over.

You are right, I didn't ask, since you supplied detailed instructions. 
Your instructions give plenty of necessary and useful info but they say 
nothing about the use of a flat cover, rather than dished however (In 
either the emailed instructions after I ordered, or in any tech article 
on your site, or in the text info in the order area for the Schadek pump 
- If I am wrong I will gladly apologize!).  The mention of modifying a 
type 1 cover for type 4 use is restricted to:
&quot;One corner of the T-I pump cover will need to be ground down to clear 
the 7 o'clock fan shroud mount boss on the engine case&quot;

I followed that instruction, except the corner that needs to be ground 
is the upper left, or about 10 o'clock on my watch.  This, of course, is 
probably different for different case versions.

&gt; 
&gt; did you actually ask US about this (I know the answer is NO) before posting
&gt; this to the list? Our instructions indicate the mods that are required on
&gt; the T-1 covers (the dished ones), or you can use a flat cover.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I can't believe, after all the research I did before and during the
&gt;&gt;&gt; above exercise, that I never encountered anyone's advice on this problem
&gt;&gt;&gt; (including AC_dot_net the vendor).  Am I really the first to do this
&gt;&gt;&gt; dumb-a** task?
