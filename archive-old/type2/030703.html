&gt; You can get a Catalytic Safety heater that runs off of propane gas,

&gt; 110 square feet for $240!


I had bought one of these by Coleman about 25 yrs ago. They just radiate
heat, there's no hot air circulating so things dont actually warm up. You
get warm, but the air around you doesn't , at least not until everything
else has absorbed radiated heat.
