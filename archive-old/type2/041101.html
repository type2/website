Subject: Re: bus engine

Hi Volks!

Access Systems &lt;accessys_at_smart_dot_net&gt; wrote to the List:
&gt; there is confusion here all the time, the bus/van is the type2 however
&gt; when VW built the type 4 car they designed a totally different engine,
&gt; this engine was then put into the type 2 bus.  so you have a type 2
&gt; vehicle with a type 4 engine. 

Correct so far.  JFTR, Type 1 is the Bug, Type 3 is the 1600,
and Type 4 is the 411/412.

&gt; (just to make it more confusing they also
&gt; type the body styles, so you have a type 2 bus/type4 engine/type2 body
&gt; style!  confused yet, don't worry about it)

No.  Body styles are designated by &quot;T&quot; (for &quot;Transporter&quot;), not
Type.  T1 is the Splitty, T2 the Bay, T3 the Vanagon, and T4
some FWD thing that's both ugly and off topic. ;-)

Favourite example: an '81 Vanagon would hence be a Type 2,
T3, with a Type 4 engine.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
