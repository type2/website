&gt; Watch the CO meter, if it jumps, the leak is in the area of the puff.

To answer your question yes there is a way to test for vacuum leaks.
Take a can of WD-40 or better yet Carb Cleaner, and spray it onto
sections were the suspected vacuum leak is...
If there is a vacuum leak the idle will go up and you've found your leak...

Hope thats Helpful....
