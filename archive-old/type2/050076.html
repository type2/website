Subject: [T2] Westy Cabinet

If anyone would like an icebox cabinet from a 74 Westy, I have one that I'd
like to see go to a happy home inside of someone's VW.  It is in pretty good
shape and has been in use in our VW.

However, between the size of our tandem and other gear we carry in addition
to the new monster size cooler that we prefer to use, the icebox cabinet
just gets in the way.  So, if anyone would like it you can have it.  The
cabinet is just outside of Nashville Tn.
