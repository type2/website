&gt;&gt; well, the shop took a look at it and said its not really worth

&gt;&gt;     
&gt; Chris, what IS the state of the engine aside from the oil pickup?
&gt;
&gt; What city are you located in?
&gt;   

I am located in Eureka, CA.
The local shop I used is called 'Honest Engine.'


There was fairly low compression on all 4 prior to this happening, and I 
had been thinking that a rebuild was in my future as is. Purchased the 
van 3 years ago with 110,000 miles on it, somewhere around 35k on a 
'rebuild.' - but no documentation about the rebuild and since then have 
found some less than stellar PO repairs.

Ive put an additional 30k miles on the motor/bus since then, so ive been 
thinking its due anyway. It had started to leak oil and was having more 
and more trouble building up proper oil pressure until some warmup time, 
even after installing thermostat. (not that the thermostat has anything 
to do with the oil pressure I guess, just the 'warmup' in general.)


On a trip 2 months back to the Santa Cruz MT's, we had 4 humans (large) 
and 2 dogs (XL) and all of our gear and the van had some serious trouble 
climbing hills (not suprisingly, but worse than id usually expect) - 
when we finally slowed you could hear some pretty loud 'clack clack 
clack' sounds as i accelerated, eventually going away after topping off 
the oil and driving around the block a few times. im guessing there was 
some damage done then as well.

&gt;   
&gt;&gt; I have been trying to consider all available options and im going  
&gt;&gt; with the AVP rebuilt longblock. im sending my core in tomorrow  
&gt;&gt; hopefully to get the ball rolling, then have my local shop swap it  
&gt;&gt; out for me.
&gt;&gt;     
&gt;
&gt; I'm just guessing, but if the case is hosed and encouraging you to  
&gt; get the engine rebuilt I don't think you can expect a core fee back  
&gt; from AVP so why bother wasting any money/time to send it to them?
&gt;
&gt;   
Unlike many rebuilders, AVP doesn't look at the core as another way to 
collect fees from customers. If your core can be used and has some 
damage, they will simply charge you for the labor to repair the case, if 
it can be. It'll depend on what we find when we split the case, but they 
said even if the pickup tube connector or whatever it is that can break 
when I overtighten the strainer bolt, is cracked, its only about an hour 
repair at about $50 labor, so it's still worth the $350 partial core 
charge. (ok, minus another $65-80 for frieght) - - even if I only end up 
with around $200-$250 in a core return fee, after damage and frieght, 
what's it worth for me to keep it?
