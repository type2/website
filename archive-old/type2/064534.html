Don't be so hard on yourself - if at best you were a pain in the ass,
I'd hate to see you at your worst..;)

Oh, and Charlie, it makes it difficult to read your post when there is
no word wrapping. Consult your internet server or local computer guru to
get your lines shorter. Good post by the way - after getting it wrapped,
I was able to read it.. Hope your upcoming trip will be posted to us to,
when it is all finished..
