Subject: Re: [T2] Asian tools

Caveat Emptor.

Of course, your mileage may vary.

I still try, whenever possible, to buy tools made stateside.

I have to admit, however, that my very excellent set of micro tools for 
computer work are all made in Taiwan. I simply couldn't find any decent 
US-made tools.

But I did buy them at Radio Shack, and Terri Hatcher does their 
commercials, and she drives a Type 2 Westy.

(How's that for staying on topic?)

Cheers,
Anton
