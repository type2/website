Subject: why is this so difficult?

I just like to say whats up to all fellow listees.  The info posted has been 
excellent.  
Why is this so difficult?  The bumper is not fitting properly on the bus it 
seems as though the back end got wider since i did the engine work because 
the two bumper supports arent fitting like they should.   is parallelation 
the key?  Another thing why is the last back piece of the engine compartment 
not fitting?  it wont go in about another inch so i can secure.   please let 
me know.   Vw really makes it a matter of centimeters.  

ps.  anyone try those one-man break bleeders?
