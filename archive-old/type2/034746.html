&gt; new tranny time, shifting has been kinda hard recently..

You either have a partially broken clutch cable or (less likely) you
have a broken clutch fork.  First thing to do is to pull out the clutch
cable.  A broken one will be quite obvious, and fairly easy to replace.
 Use lots of grease on the new cable to give it a long life!
