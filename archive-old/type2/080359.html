Subject: virus warning

FYI -- I received a &quot;mysterious&quot; e-mail directly addressed
to me from &quot;chopper&quot; - no text, and related to a thread I
started on shift rod bushings weeks ago (when I was still on
the list - I now only get the digest) .... I have received
another two other similar messages, first -  from &quot;someone&quot;
another, unrealated list on which another address received
the same type of message and verified it as a virus attempt
and another verbally verified virus originated e-mail from a
company that I had only e-mailed once..... she said her
computer was shut down during the time the messages were
date stamped - but still pumpted out a bunch of blank
e-mails to e-mails in their address book.

I can understand going thru the address book, but going into
the stored inbox mail messages and pulling out addresses and
the subject lines...thats a new one to me.

There were no attachments on anything I received.

My virus protection has Drop Scan, and I scan everything
before I open it....and the virus program didnt pick
anything up.

Anybody else??
