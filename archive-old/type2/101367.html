Subject: RE: [T2] dual carbs to single.

&lt;&lt; I've been told that if you get an old Pinto air-cleaner from a junkyard,
it

has an intake for the heat riser. I have a generic circular cleaner on mine

and am not sure right now how I'll make sure that the warm air from my fabbed

riser will be drawn in over the cold air from the rest of the engine

compartment.


Ive heard from some guy up there that plymouth voyager Air Filter assembly do
a well job!!
