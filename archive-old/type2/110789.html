&gt; Interesting. I was considering swapping out to straight 50w for the

&gt; be in for a rethink. Perhaps the men of science on the list can shed
&gt; more light on the issue.

&quot;As a matter of fact, I _am_ a rocket scientist...&quot;  :)

The theory is that the rate of flow thought the cooler is regulated by the
actual viscosity of the oil.  If the oil is too thick to go through the
cooler easily, the bypass opens and shunts oil around the cooler and
directly to the oil gallery.  The purpose of this bypass is probably to
save the oil cooler on very cold days.

It remains to be seen whether viscosity at normal operating
temperature is sufficient to regulate the temperatures.  You could check
this by monitoring the position of the bypass valve while using 50W oil to
see if it remains partially open as temperatures reach operating range.
If it does, the viscosity regulates the temperature, if not, the cooler
gets all the flow regardless of the temperature.

You'd have to make a special bypass valve with a pin extending out to
indicate the valve position.  Not hard, but not trivial either.
