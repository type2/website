Agreed.

&gt;Use at least mid grade, 89 octane, fuel.

An expensive bit of insurance, that.  I run 87 (or lower if I'm in higher 
elevation) and prevent pinging by keeping tabs on the timing, compression, 
and engine temperature.  To each their own I guess.

&gt;Also most sending units for oil temp
&gt;gauges measure the case temperature because they are engineered by morons.
&gt;Or should I say greedy dishonest morons.

The sump plate senders are OEM Porsche parts and give useful 
readings.  I've been running one for 12 years.  Maybe you're talking about 
another type of sender though.
