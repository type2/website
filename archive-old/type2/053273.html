Subject: Steering box success!

Hey Volks,

If I can do it anyone can!  I successfully removed and replaced my
steering box in my '70 westy.  What a difference.  Used a two arm puller
&gt;from Sears (should have bought the three arm)  I took a while but
everything came off and went back on like it should.  I installed via
Bentley now my steering wheel is off.  The PO has got to be the
culprit.  Now, I am ready to head to the PA bus breakfast in Pennsburg
and to Maplegrove, PA on Sunday.  Got some work to do before hand.  I
had a buddy of mine replace the rockers and some how the new interior
that I sewed caught on fire.  Have to replace the back rest of the back
seat.  That's all for now, thanks for the advice.  Three cheers for the
kooky math teacher!
