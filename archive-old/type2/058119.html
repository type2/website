i told you guys that i had a little tap tap when the motor is warm. well now
ive found that it gets louder with the clutch pedal in. a very slight donk
donk. i just put a new clutch in (all 3 pieces) and believe i did a good job.
what do you think this could be? im thinking something to do with the
crankshaft. another quick question, is it normal for the crank to move a
little with the flywheel off. mine did and a buddy told me that the flywheel
holds it in place........  c u _at_ jerome,   marty :)
