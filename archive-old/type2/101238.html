Subject: Stock air cleaner/air cleaner tube

Hi all! 
I'm currently looking for the stock air cleaner and the tube that runs to it 
from the carb for my 71 Westie.  It appears that the tubes are out there, but 
the air cleaners are hard to come by!  I'll buy or trade if anyone's 
interested; I still have that Bugspray and dual port manifold, as well as 
other parts to trade up on!
Thanks!
Barry
