Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Line cutoff alternative

Indeed I sent the wrong information. The FL-219 is a normally closed, 12 
VDC 1/4&quot; fitting valve.

I can send a .pdf copy of their catalog on request. It is 1151 KB.

&gt;That is the kind of valve i have been looking for. Unfortunately the FL205 
&gt;is natural gas.  Right below it is FL206 which is gasoline.  1/8&quot; 
&gt;fitting.  Called the local supplier and got the flow rates and 
&gt;pressures.  Flow rate for use from the fuel tank side was not enough.

&gt;&gt;This valve is designed for gasoline and is 12volts and has a 1/4&quot; fitting 
&gt;&gt;which I believe is big enough for our needs. They have a normally open 
&gt;&gt;and a normally closed valve. I will be buying the normally closed so when 
&gt;&gt;I turn the key on it opens unless my &quot;secret&quot; toggle switch is in the off 
&gt;&gt;position.
&gt;&gt;I think the price was less than $50 and cheap insurance against gravity 
&gt;&gt;fed gasoline fires where the fuel line ruptures and the fuel continues to 
&gt;&gt;flow out due to gravity thus creating a bigger fire.
&gt;&gt;Also would be a useful theft deterrent - separate switch to interrupt the 
&gt;&gt;current to this valve when you want a little extra protection - put a 
&gt;&gt;hidden toggle switch in the camper cabinets out back or under the seat 
&gt;&gt;pedestals.
