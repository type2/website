Subject: re:re: bus engine....80 Vanagon ?

The 1980 vanagon engine is a &quot;CV&quot; block.  You find the
CV near the breather pipe on the top of the engine. 
These 2L engines, the last of the air cooled, were the
same I think from 1980 to 1982 plus (some 1983 were
water cooled).

&gt; 
&gt; the basic engine is the same but there are tin
&gt; differences while the 78 &amp;
&gt; 79 are almost perfect drop fits, also usually a lot
&gt; more expensive
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;try your best to get a 2L, preferrably a fuel
&gt; injected version with
&gt; &gt; &gt;Hydralic lifters.  (78, or  79) these are good
&gt; solid engines.
