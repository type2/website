Unless it has a working steering column lock it's easier to just hotwire it
if it's not going to be a permanent fix and you plan to have the ignition
re-keyed to match the rest later.

Best enticement for installing an alarm on any bus (or bug)  you
restore/repair/put-money-into is the fact that any kid with two pieces of
wire in his pocket can start it and drive away if s/he can get inside the
cab.

But, to make life easy and stay out from under the dash.

1. Make a &quot;remote starter switch&quot; pushbutton switch normally open with one
wire to the &quot;little wire&quot; on the starter and the other wire to battery &quot;+&quot;

This provides +12 to the solenoid when you push the button and will turn
the starter over but not start the motor. For actually getting fire you
need to:

2. Make a jumper with at least 12 gauge wire and run it from battery &quot;+&quot; to
the &quot;+&quot; side of the coil. This part acts like turning the key switch to the
&quot;run&quot; position.

Same cautions as when testing with the key. Turn it OFF (disconnect the
coil jumper) unless you are actually trying to start the vehicle. You can
turn it over for compression tests without having that jumper connected.
