&gt; Yes and Yes.

hmmmm, ;8*?

&gt; 73, stock dual carbs (sorry, I just figure everybody knows that. LOL!!!)

can't imagine both carbs doing it at the same time but did you check that
the choke is dropping out??

I assume you have checked the air intakes..removed the air filter etc.
it's been a long time since I had a dual carb (and I remember I hated it)

can't imagine syncronizing to be the problem or the linkages. even if only
two cyl were working you could drive and you could spot the problem...

gotta be frustrating and it is most likely something stupid you can fix in
3 minutes after you find it...

good luck will cogitate on this some more
