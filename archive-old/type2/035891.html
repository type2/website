Subject: BN4 and thanks...

OK...thanks to everyone for the greetings and advice.
BN4 findings...When I first got the bus, the BN4 had a shop tag on it that 
said &quot;bad fuel pump&quot;, but tests showed this not to be the case. Upon 
complete tear down I found among several in line fuel screens, a very *very* 
fine screen in the brass jet that fits into the combustion chamber. This 
screen had no plastic frame, and clogged constantly. I finally removed it, 
which returned operation to normal.
When Espar sent out the parts manual, there was no screen shown in any of 
the fiches...Who would do that?
Thanks for the advice...keep you all posted on heat...
