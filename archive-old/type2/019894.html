&gt; Any ideas how to get that like new white back to a westy pop top without

See if you can find something in the LAUNDRY aisle of your supermarket
(here in CA Safeway has it) called SOILOVE.  Fairly bright green
bottle.  It's cheap and effective at removing environmental grime, and
since it's formulated as a laundry product, SHOULD be safe for use in
any circumstance.  And get a few xtra bottles for the woman of the
house, should there be one!  We use it for ALL of our tuff cleaning -
beats the hell outa simple green.

Then maybe a good coat of automotive wax to discourage dirt from
settling on/in the nooks and crannies.
