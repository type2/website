Subject: Re: scary situation

Could you examine all the electrical wiring of the oil pressure light 
circuit, looking for broken, abraded, crimped wires and loose/corroded 
connections? And perhaps use another means to decide if you have a low oil 
pressure problem or not?
(Like, measure the oil pressure with a real pressure gauge hooked into an 
oil line, because the light may not be giving reliable signals.)
Others on the list will offer advice, and you could consider seeking the 
services of a mechanic if the suggested activities are not possible in your 
situation.

Hey guys. ............  oil pressure light flashed on and off.  ........... 
light occasionally flickers  off but mostly
  stays on.  ..................So what to do?  Change the oil and 
filter?  Are clogged oil  coolers common?  Bad sensor?  Pump?  I don't 
feel  comfortable at all driving it as it is.  Please help!   Cheers...KR
