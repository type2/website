Subject: Bus Won't Start -- Weird (Long)

Short Version:

So, my '71 bus won't start.  Turns over ok, just won't start
-- or even &quot;catch&quot;.  As per Muir, I:

	1) checked that I have fuel
	2) checked the coil and choke connections
	3) a. checked the fuse
	   b. checked the ignition switch by running a 
		hotwire from the alternator nut to the
		coil (non-condenser wire side)

	4) checked the coil:
		a) is getting juice -- multimeter from switch
			side or condenser side to ground with
			key on gives 12.6V
		b) is giving a spark when turning over the 
			engine by holding the distributor wire
			1/8&quot; from ground and having a friend
			run turn over the engine

4b) doesn't give me a spark, so i figured: &quot;Replace the coil
	and i should be good&quot;.  Well, I replaced the coil and
	I still get no spark.  This makes me wonder if my methodology
	is correct or not.  To check myself, I:
		a) tried 4b with the hotwire from the alternator in 
			place to check the ignition wasn't bad as well
		b) tried 4b with the wire from the carb disconnected
			to make sure that it wasn't grounded out somehow
			and drawing current away from the coil
		c) tried an old coil &lt;-&gt; distributor wire I had hanging
			about


Is my method for checking whether the coil gets a spark or not wrong?
DDid I just get a bad coil, or could there be something else wrong?

The condenser and points are also new, but I'm not sure that this would
effect the coil wire sparking.


The long story is this:

My points' set-screw and the inner plate of my distributor were messed up
and I was trying to use a sheet metal screw to just get it tightened
down enough so that I could drive it for a day and get some other 
stuff sorted out.  While I was attempting to re-gap my points
(had just turned on the car and saw that the dwell angle was *way*
off), I shorted the gap between the points (I had left the key on).
I don't think that this should have affected anything, but I'm
reaching for a reason that my car won't start and this is one of the
only things that I can think of. 

Right, so I get everything back together, etc. and the car won't start.
I go through the checklist above and I don't see a spark from the coil
so I assume that's bad.  So, last night, I put in the new coil, along
with a new distributor (009) that included a new cap, rotor, points, condenser.
The new distributor turns with the engine, so I expect it's been installed
properly, and I set the points before I tried any of this.

So, are there other things I Have to worry about when putting in the
new dizzy?  

I guess I'm at a loss.  I could go through further diagnosis -- swapping 
out the new condenser and points for old ones, trying to isolate what's
not working, and, I suppose what I should have done would have
been to check the new coil with the old distributor, etc. in the car
to determine whether it had been a coil problem at all or not, but...

So yeah, any help/ideas are appreciated.  Just want to get the girl
back on the road.
