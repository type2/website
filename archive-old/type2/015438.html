 or you may start a fire.
&gt;    Not to insult your technical abilities, but this should be done by
&gt;someone with a fare amount of experience, most of all the carb part. Now
&gt;everyone is going to think I want to &quot;keep the little woman in the kitchen&quot;.
&gt;Please don't send me hate mail! :-) :-)
&gt;    Good luck!

Last I heard, the gender of the incompetant has no meaning when the flames
erupt. In all cases where raw fuel is involved, sound reasoning, reflection
and understanding must be employed. A burned up Bus is trumped by a burned
up Bus and garage and house and/or do-it-yourselfer, regardless the gender
of any of them.
