Subject: Re: [T2] T-shirt take 2

I certainly apologize for getting this hornets nest stirred up. And I
certainly don't want to cause problems with the people whose knowledge and
experience is priceless. I only thought some of the members might like the
shirt design, nothing more, nothing less. Again, I apologize for not knowing
this rule, and I give my word I will not link to any other ebay auction.

&gt; &gt; Isn't it different to point out a cool VW find that you are not
&gt; &gt; selling.? I thought the point of the ebay edict was not to allow folks
&gt; &gt; to take up list space promoting their own listings on ebay.
&gt; &gt; There were more than a few posts re: the release of products around the
&gt; &gt; Disney &quot;Cars&quot; movie.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What say ye oh list-Meister(s)?
&gt;
&gt; This question seems to come up periodically.
&gt;
&gt; The problem is separating fish from fowl.  Some ebay sellers have no
&gt; compunction against using multiple identities to sidestep &quot;own auction&quot;
&gt; restrictions, so it was decided by a list majority to prohibit all
&gt; auction advertisements.  That way there is no questions about what is
&gt; allowed or not.
&gt;
&gt; OTOH, if a listee has something he would like to sell, he is welcome
&gt; to sell it directly on the list.
