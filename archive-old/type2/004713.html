Subject: Re: [T2] 1700 Cylinder Head Mystery Holes

1700 heads with EGR ports can be filled with M10X1.0 Bolts.
I'm curious why nobody seems to mind the fact he has a
flycut 1700 head on one side and an 1800 head on the other.
These heads  have different valve sizes and different combustion
chamber design, with different volumes, and so different CR on
both sides of the engine. Not a good idea. Back to the Bentley.

&gt;Actually Jake, it sounds like he's got the stock early 1700 heads. They had
&gt;holes that were just behind the exhaust valve outlet for the air injection
&gt;tubes that connected to the air pump, as part of the exhaust gas afterburning
&gt;(i.e.,. Emission Control) system. Early mod.s had holes at all four exhaust
&gt;ports, later mod.s had them at 1,2 and 3 only. They can easily be tapped and
&gt;plugged.
