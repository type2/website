Subject: Electronic ignition - opinions sought

Guess it's getting to be that time of year again... Someone asked me 
today if I had any idea what I wanted for a Christmas gift, and I 
immediately thought &quot;hmm, electronic ignition unit for the Bus might be 
pretty cool...&quot;

So I thought I would seek opinions here about the virtues of the 
various competing products out there (I already know the virtues of 
electronic ignition in general :-)

The one I've heard mentioned the most is the Pertronix Ignitor.  
Pertronix also has an Ignitor II, but it seems that it is not listed as 
available for VWs in their compatibility chart.  Aircooled_dot_net also 
carries one called Compufire.

I'm also interested in knowing the installation details/theory of 
operation for folks who have experience with these products (I already 
know how Hall Effect sensors work; I'm talking about the mechanical 
specifics in the context of a VW vac advance/retard distributor).

Thanks!
