&gt; I had already been advised that the problem might have been an intermittent fault in the AFM, and as we are heading off on a big desert trip in a few weeks, I shelled out for a new AFM.
&gt; 
&gt; But, the problem is still there.

Check your hoses for vacume leaks and also make sure your fuel
pressure regulator is OK!  Mine drove me nuts with it's missing and
rough idle until I replaced the pressure unit.
