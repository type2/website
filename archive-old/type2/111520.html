Subject: I'm back for a second (engine drop this weekend)

Hello, all!

I am back for just a second, aftger which I will disappear again for
another couple months. I have been very busy on non-VW things (fixing my
house and arranging construction on a new house) and that process is still
not complete.  Alas, it has to take priority over all but vital VW stuff,
tho after it is complete, I do hope to return.

That said, the clutch on the '80 vanagon has gone from &quot;I can make it slip
if I really goose it&quot; thru &quot;I can keep it from slipping if I try&quot; to &quot;It
slips, but I can still get it up to speed if I am careful.&quot;  Before it
gets to the &quot;I had to get it towed home&quot; stage, I think I am gonna replace
the clutch :-)

If you have never seen an engine dropped or a clutch replaced and you live
in the DC area and you would like to, then P-mail me and plan on dropping
by on Saturday!  I will e-mail directions by request.  The drop will be
held in Alexandria, VA, since I don't think the bus would make Springfield
at this point.
