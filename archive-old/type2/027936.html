I suspect there is some truth to that (but I wouldnt bet the farm on it
without external confirmation).
I had a starter from a '69 Ghia laying around when the starter in my '67 bus
went south.  They &quot;looked&quot; the same and I stuck it in.
... that was almost 2 years ago

Welcom back All!
I have been dying to ask this question for 3 days.  I am looking at buying a
starter for my 66 bus with 71 engine from a guy online.  He says it is
compatible for ALL AIR-COOLED VW's WITH A 12 VOLTT SYSTEM.  Is this
possible, or is the guy a few cabinets short of a complete Westy
interior?!?!  Looking through dealer catalogs, I see that there are many
more than one model  12 volt starter.  The price is right, but if it may not
work, I don't want to waste my bread.
