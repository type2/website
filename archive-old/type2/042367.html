Subject: Where does the horn wire go ?

I have just spent 3 days replacing the fuse box in '71 with a later one as
the original had been moved from the correct position and this seemed easier
than putting it back and the later model (is it the same as a Bug one ? It
looks like it) can be screwed to the air ducting. I know this isn't stock
but it looks neat and is better than having it hang on its own wires. I also
repleced the non-standard flasher relay with the correct one which fits in
the bottom of the box and fitted the clock (after fixing it - what a strange
mechanism) and tidyed up the wiring, cleaned connections etc.

Anyway, one problem that I didn't fix was the horn button. Mine is wired to
a switch on the dash :-( and I looked at the wrie coming from the top of the
column but can't see where it exits the bottom. It is held firmly so I
assume is connected to something but seems to be connected electrically to
the ground. What is the route of this wire ? The manual says something about
a tag at the bottow on the column under the van but I can't see one. Am I
going to have to remove &amp; replace the whole column to fix this ? 

Sime I spent too long on replaceing the cracked wheel with a good one just
so I can put the horn back where it belongs I really want to get this fixed
!

Thanks
