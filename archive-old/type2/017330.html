Subject: Muir Bashing (was Engine Hesitation)

&gt; I continue to believe that (stoner) John Muir causes more harm than
&gt; good! I remember reading in an early edition how he didn't trust CV

Okay, now we're bashing religious freedom! And knocking personal
lifestyle choices (yeah, I used to be a stoner too!). B)

I learned how to work on VW's primarily through Muir's book. It leaves a
lot to be desired, but when I was putting the 1800cc back together, I
had Muir and Bentley open side by side on the bench. Muir went through
step by step... cook-book approach to reassembly. He just left out a lot
of detail and interjected personal opinion without objective explanation
as to how he formed the opinion. Bentley, on the other hand, is arranged
systematically (not assembly order), and presents the &quot;facts&quot; as VWoA
published them (although I've read on the list that there are some
glaring errors).

I would still recommend to a newbie that they use both books side by
side for major procedures on their bus/bug. I have other manuals now
(Haynes, Intereurope, etc), which I usually only break out if Muir &amp;
Bentley leave questions unanswered... then I come to the list! And,
contrary to the statement in Muir's book: THINK! :)

Former list guru Will Wood once said to me &quot;Muir's DEAD!&quot;... a very good
point. Muir died when our cars had fewer miles than they do today,
before much innovation was made in building/modifying VWs... and before
a lot of the aftermarket parts turned to junk... his book should be read
with that in mind. But Bentley won't make recommendations like running
inner tubes so you can repair a second (or third) flat when doing your
best Edward Abbey desert rat imitation. And Bentley's illustrations
don't make me grin. :)

My two cents worth.

Could Muir's lack of trust in CV's &amp; Vac. Adv. distributors been
marijuana induced paranoia? :)
