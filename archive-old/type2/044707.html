Subject: [T2] won't idle
Content-Disposition: inline

&gt; I'm having problems with my 70 Westy, she just wont idle.  I just
&gt; replace the entire exhaust and accelerator cable.  Checked the timing,
&gt; that looks ok.  Everything seems to be adjusted properly, but alas, it
&gt; just kills whenever I come to a stop.  Does anyone have any ideas what
&gt; else could be causing this?

Maybe you have a brake servo installed and the vacuum hose that runs from
the servo to the intake manifold could be old and cracked and leaking vacuum
causing stalling when you hit the brakes, high lean idle otherwise. Replace the
hose if this is the case.
