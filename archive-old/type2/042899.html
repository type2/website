&gt; &gt; Does anyone know how much I should torque the oil pressure switch on my
&gt; &gt; 76 2000FI.  It gets stiff, then it turns more, then stiff, then turns
&gt; &gt; more.  I don't want to strip it though!
&gt; 
&gt; hate to tell you this, but it sounds like you already did.
&gt; (you just described the behavior of a stripped fastener to a T)
&gt; 
&gt; i always make mine snug, and then tighten a hair more if i see any leaks,
&gt; i tend to err on the side of caution here.
&gt; 
&gt; take care,
