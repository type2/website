&gt; Hi Amy...

&gt; Dave's suggestions are quite good.  The only thing I would add, related to
&gt; the preheat, is the fact that you might be experiencing some carb icing.

His comments are from a place with high humidity, you should know where you are
and at sub-freezing the air is so dry there is unlikely to be the ice buildup,
it is happens when you are above freezing and the air is saturated with
humidity, then freezes the ice out of the water vapor as vacuum in the carb
causes classic refrigeration of the air.
You will want to have some manifold heat to make the idle smoother but you are
not experiencing the ice buildup if you are in low humidity cold.  You are
experiencing a stall due to richness build-up, when you restart note the black
smoke and you have to open the throttle to &quot;clear out&quot; the wet gas inside your
combustion chamber.  If it can burn all the gas, it doesn't build up.  You need
wet gas to start it cold, but you only need enough gas vapor to burn itself all
up thereafter.
