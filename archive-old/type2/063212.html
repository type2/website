Subject: Weekend _at_ &quot;Hanging Dog&quot;

A couple of questions/concerns:

        1.      To Jonathan Edwards &lt;snuggles&gt;: I assume that the '75 Westy
                you are looking at is in the Raleigh area? Have you seen the
                orange Westy sitting on the East side of the highway from
                Chimney Rock to Asheville (almost directly across from the
                entrance to Edwards High School)? I've been tempted to stop
                and inquire about it.  BTW, I saw the one you mentioned
                previously (near the Woodcarver's shop in Fairview...looked
                really rough to me.

        2.      To Erick Sowder (and others going to Hanging Dog near
                Murphy, NC: I, too, have been dealing with a gas odor in
                my '78 Westy.  One mechanic simply told me that if it's 
                a VW it smells like gasoline.  I HAVE determined that the
                engine compartment is dry, and have looked from underneath
                on a lift, w/o finding the source.  I don't know if I will
                make it to Murphy, but would really like to in order to 
                have some of you veteran t2'ers advise me.

        3.      My brother owns a '78 Westy (almost identical to mine...
                (beautiful avocado green and all) except that his has some
                serious motor problems (oil spray through the dipstick, etc)
                He has given up on getting work done, as everyone we have
                talked to so far has declined to work on the Porsche 914
                pancake engines.  Does anyone in the North Carolina
                contingent know of a VW specialist who could work on the
                engine? I would REALLY like for him to get his Westy on
                the road so I would have a travelling companion for camping
                in Western NC.

        BTW, how many campers are expected to be at Hanging Dog this weekend?
