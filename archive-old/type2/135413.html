&lt;&lt; What's the best way to clean them?

TIA &gt;&gt;

A high pressure washer works wonders...Be sure to wrap &quot;everything&quot;
you'd prefer not to get wet with plastic and start with the lowest pres-
sure setting...If you can beg, borrow, or purloin one with an attachment
for solvent (mild), or soap that's even better. If there's a DIY car wash
in your neighborhood, they usually have a coin operated one...If nothing
else, the local FLAPS might have the cheepee version that screws onto
a garden hose and increases the pressure a bit more than just the hose.
