Subject: 1978 2.0L FI unit Spark Plug Swap - head removal? Not 

Minor variation on same idea:  I did a number of Heli-coil installs on VW air 
cooled engines.  Made up an adapter that allowed me to blow into the intake 
manifold with a shop-vac; then opened the intake valve of the cylinder to be 
repaired; ran the Heli-coil tap with the chips coming out as I would cut; and 
finally I soldered a #22 stranded copper wire on the tang, to retrieve the tang 
after breaking-off after the Heli-coil reached correct depth.  Worked great...

Head removal is &quot;NOT&quot; necessary! Simply pull the plug (or its already out
right), pull the valve cover over that cylinder, roll the engine over until
the &quot;EXHAUST&quot; valve &quot;ONLY&quot; on that cylinder is fully opened, do the tread
repair letting the chips fall where they will, then blow air into the
exhaust pipe! With the valve opened all the chips will be removed threw the
plug hole, simple! Worked at the dealer for twenty years and it was always
done that way with no problems.
