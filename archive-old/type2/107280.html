Subject: Check Engine Light

I'll start w/ bus content:  Until I get the engine back in Pumpkin II, I'm
driving my wife's 1996 Mazda Millenia...

I pressure washed the Mazda's engine, a little too enthusiastically, and it
developed a rough idle and threw a check engine light.  After it dried out
it ran OK, but the light is still locked on.  Anybody know how to reset the
code/light?  The car is basically a Ford Probe, and I recall that it can be
done with a paper clip in the ECU service receptacle under the
dash...anyone?


TIA,
RickG '77 Westy &quot;Pumpkin II&quot;
