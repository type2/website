Subject: Re: propane safety

Hey Bob!

the reverse threads is because propane is considered a fuel, like Acetylene.  
That's why - so you don't get them mixed up with the &quot;air&quot; or &quot;oxygen&quot; 
regulators and stuff!

I even had a coleman lantern that hooked to the top of the little bottles and 
hung up (tho I always hung it on a piece of wire, just in case!)... a lot 
better than worrying about killing my battery, and it kept the bus warm if 
needed...

BTW, one other thing I did was to use the stove on low low low as an 
emergency heater... not recommended, but in a pinch it was better than 
freezing!  Left the poptop unzipped a few inches for ventillation.  I was 
trying to figure how to make a &quot;fueling station&quot; using a 5 gallon propane 
tank to fuel the buses little propane tank... I know it's safe, but I'm not 
about to tear it out to get it OK'd and then put it back in!  Or maybe just a 
way to hook a 5 gal. tank inline... (Any ideas??)

When you arise in the morning, give thanks for the food and the joy of 
living.  If you see no reason for giving thanks, the fault lies only in 
yourself.  Abuse no one and nothing, for abuse turns the wise ones into fools 
and robs the spirit of it's vision.
