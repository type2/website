Subject: Vent Wing Leaks

Hiya All,

I had all my window seals (American style) replaced with Wolfsburg West seals 
some time ago.  The guy who did the windows for me has a top-notch reputation 
for his workmanship.  Problem is that my left center vent wing leaks.  I know 
these little buggers have a reputation for leaking but.............  I 
rebuilt all the vent wings myself.  My window guy looked over and pronounced 
them, &quot;good to go&quot;.  At this point in time I do not believe the leakage is 
coming from the &quot;seal&quot; between the main window and the vent itself.
So..........  all of you who have worked these vents over in the past, where 
is the leak likely coming from?  The glass seems to fit snuggly to the rubber 
when closed.  I'm thinking it might be in the area where the vent post passes 
through the rubber seal.  Is it possible for water to get down and through 
the seal at this point?  Any ideas (of where the leak is or possible fixes) 
would be appreciated at this point.
By the way, I would do the obvious and talk to my window guy, but he is 
unavailable for the next couple of months.

Mike
