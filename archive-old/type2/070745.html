Subject: relays - the continuing saga

i've isolated the highbeam dimmer relay with help from Tommy at VW 
Restorations USA. in my bus it's part number 321 941 583. however, 
i'm being told by more than three sources now to use 111 941 583.

the thing that has me a little confused/worried is that all of the 
catalogs i've seen on the web list 111 941 583 as a '68-69 part, not 
a 1971.

can anyone confirm that it's ok to install one of these in my '71? 
the last thing i need is another electrical problem...
