Subject: Distributor position ?

I have a '76 2.0 FI bus and the distributor is oriented such that the  
vacuum diaphragm on the side is blocking access to the cold start  
valve and its connector. I would like to rotate the assy 90 degrees  
CW so that the CSV connector is no longer is blocked. It seems to me  
this should be possible if I also move the spark plug wires by 90  
degrees CW. Should this work, or are there other factors wrt  
distributor orientation that would prevent it?

thanks,
Ron Johnson
