Subject: [T2] Brakes work but handbrake doesn't (on one side)??

&gt;The right rear hand brake does not engage (though works fine on
&gt;the left side) and the brakes generally work great all around.

Sounds very similar to the problem I had on my '72.
The left side &quot;hand&quot; (parking) brake engaged on the left side but didn't
move at all on the right.  Turns out the cable was completely frozen
inside its guide tube.  There are two cables, one for each rear wheel,
that run from the rear brakes, through a metal tube, and meet up front
under the cab.  I disconnected the right cable at both ends, shot
lubricant down the tube, and muscled it loose.  It works fine for now.
Hope this helps.
