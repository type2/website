&gt; Folks,
&gt; 
&gt; I am just finishing up my 68 Westy Resoration. New engine, interior and
&gt; paint. However, I may be leaving for Italy for at least 15 months sometime
&gt; this year. Does anyone know of reputable overseas shipping companies that
&gt; might be entrusted to ship my pride and joy overseas for me. Also, anyone
&gt; with experience doing this. I will be bring the beast back home upon my
&gt; return, and do not wish to purchase a car whilst I am in Italy.
&gt; 
&gt; Your experience for my benefit.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; 
&gt; Matt
