Subject: How to clean out a intake manifold Heat riser - The easy way

Hi list - long-time lerker here, and hopefully I have now figured out how to
post! I have a 1979 Westy I am in the process of restoring. The heat riser in
the intake manifold gets plugged with carbon after a period of use, leading to
the formation of &quot;Carburator ice&quot;  This icing and frost on the outside of the
manifold just below the carb is the most obvious indication, as well as a
unexplained loss of power that seems to fix itself after the engine is shut
off for a while and restarted.  I have used the following process for several
years to clean out this carbon.  It requires access to an oxy/acetylene torch.
Remove the manifold from the engine, and place it on the bench. Clean the
intake of any residual fuel and oil, for safety. Set up the torch with a
neutral flame, and heat the carbon in the end of the heat riser until it glows
red. This will only take a couple seconds of heating. Without removing the
torch, turn off the acetylene and allow the oxygen to flow into the glowing
carbon. The carbon will burn away without torching and continue burning all
the way through to the other end of the riser consuming all the carbon, and
announcing itself with a puff of smoke at the other end.  The process happens
fairly quickly, and the manifold barely gets warm. When you are done, the
riser will be squeeky clean, with a very small amount of residue. All you are
doing is completing the combustion process of the carbon with the oxygen.
