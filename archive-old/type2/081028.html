I have a 72 westy that I restored...ground up and pretty much stayed to =
the recipe. It made a big difference. I live in SW Florida so the heat =
isn't such a big deal. I also found a place in Canada to buy the sound =
deadening stuff by the roll....much cheaper than the Q pads. The NASA =
stuff can be found in a multitude of places. The Canadian place is =
called creatively enough Sound Deadening material and can be found at =
www.sounddeadeningmaterial_dot_com. It was all in all quite easy. I'm glad I =
took the time to do things right.
Cheers,Dave
