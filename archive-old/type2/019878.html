This is true. Fortunately, in either of the states that I am likely to live in
(Peoples Republic of California for now, and Texas if all goes well...) the
laws are pretty open for customizing cars.

As to the safety, I agree that visibility is important. In a lot of Custom
Magazines I have seen adds for converting older cars to LED tail lights. I
have seen some that look readily adaptable to the older Bus lights, and are
HUGELY brighter (and cooler).

&gt; remember your van has to meet the standards for the year built, not sure
&gt; what they were when but I'm sure VW had a reason for that improvement.
&gt; depending on your state it may or may not effect you, but it could be a
&gt; problem for the next owner when he tries to register it.
&gt; . wiring, not sure what the differences are but I believe the wiring may
&gt; be different

If ye love wealth better than liberty, the tranquility of
servitude better than the animating contest of freedom, go
home from us in peace. We ask not your counsels or arms.
Crouch down and lick the hands which feed you. May your chains
set lightly upon you, and may posterity forget that ye were our
countrymen. -- Samuel Adams, speech at the Philadelphia
State House, August 1, 1776.
