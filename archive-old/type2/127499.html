Subject: re:cross country road trip

&quot;From: Dave Rogge II 
Well, i'm home now, fortunately.  It was a hell of a trip.  I. . . &lt;snip&gt; . . .The van did very well the first day, and it even got up to 90 once.&quot;
 
Id say that the problem was at least partly your driving speed. You arent driving a type 4 anymore Roger, keep it at 63MPH and youll keep that rebuilt awhile longer. Also that tranny. Not only that but God/s/ess/es forbid that you get in an emergancy at that speed and have to rely on four unboosted brake drums to save you.
 
Happy trails,
 
Duncan
