bob,

did you see my first post?  i just rebuilt the engine about 10k mi ago,
and
the oil has been clean for the entire time.  oil pressure is ok, and i
have
driven over 2k miles at highway speeds _with_ the noise--shouldn't a rod
bearing have finished dying by now?

i just dont want to think a rod bearing is already gone.

thanks everyone

evan
