Subject: EMPI 2002 Catalog &amp; Price List (&amp; an owie)

I just picked these up and wondered how much use they could be other than a
parts number reference.

On the owie...

I bought some 16&quot; blades for G's wipers, and had to trim about 5/16&quot; off of
the plastic rail holding the blades to get them properly installed into the
wiper arms...

(dang, it's hard to type without using your left index finger...)

... anyway, I used the sheepsfoot combo blade on my Gerber Multitool (an 800
Legend, _really_ nice Christmas present) to do this, in the rain, and the
blade slipped and neatly punctured my (you guessed it) left index finger.
Through the finger tip to the nail (at least, it hurts to the nail).  Using
my scout skills, and lamenting that the first aid kit was at home, I
bandaged it up using paper towel and electrical tape.

Thankful that a sharp blade always makes for a cleaner healing wound, and
hoping that the blade didn't carry something nasty and hungry into my
finger, I'm a bit wiser.  Next time, I use the diagonal cutters...

I miss having a wife to help deal with my injuries. :'O(

(... even if she had to fold double trying not to laugh at some of my better
attempts at self-decapitation.)
