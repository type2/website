Hey y'all
Before we departed on the annual epic adventure known as High Country Bus 
Festival and previously chronicled elsewhere, I had ordered some bearings 
and seals to re-redo the left rear bearing carrier assembly from the Bus 
Depot.  I've been used to ordering on line and receiving my stuff in 10 days 
or less.  This time the stuff didn't show so I went and bought the bearings 
and seals locally.

While we were purring along about 3 hours into the Odd-issy my cell phone 
rang.  It was the Bus Depot telling me I had a wrong expiration date on one 
of those plastic thingys I build buses with.  I told the young lady that I 
would like her to delay shipping because the kid next door likes to steal 
stuff and I didn't want an excuse to beat the snot outta him and his dad if 
something else came up missing and in their possession.

After we got back, I p-mailed the folks at Bus Depot asking what had 
happened.  Jerry and Ron both answered and I was happy with the explanation, 
basically that online orders are processed after phone orders and they had 
been busy.  The credit card deal further slowed things down and so Ron 
cancelled my order.  I wrote back thanking them for taking the time to 
answer to my satisfaction, and mentioned that I'd still like the order 
filled so I could at least carry spares in case someone suffered rear 
bearing failure while on the road.  No charges were made to my credit card 
as a result.

Today I was awakened from my afternoon nap by the UPS guy delivering a box.  
It was from, that's right, the Bus Depot.  I thought that was strange since 
I had just ordered some items today and that this was truly exceptional 
service.  I was pleasantly surprised to find bearings, seal and 3 hubcaps 
(chrome, but a little paint'll fix that ;-)).

Hats off and a big thanks to the folks at Bus Depot for taking care of us!

Dave

&quot;The question is, said Alice, whether words can mean so many things&quot;
