Subject: Re: [T2] How does low oil pr. affect hydraulics?

Mike:
All the engine oil pressure  does is make the plunger take up the slack when
the internal pressure agaist the plunger is less than engine oil pressure.
While the valve is lifting the oil pressure is held by the check ball. While
the valve is lifting, the internal pressure is more like 3-10,000 PSI.
(Whether you have 15 lbs hiop or 60 lbs hiop really is irrelevant WHILE the
valv is lifting.)
And it doesn't make a damn bit of difference if the hole is DOWN or UP! It's
the thin oil and the fact that the valve is raised.
Anytime you want, you can take one of these lifters and a bolt and put it in
a vise and squeeze all the oil out of it to get the plunger fully collapsed.
How much pressure can you exert with a vise? 1000 lbs maybe? What is the AREA
of the plunger, maybe .25-.33 square inches? This makes 4000 to 3000 psi.
this is with cold oil. An open valve at full lift might exert 250 lbs and
less as the lifter bleeds down. Maybe 130lbs closed?
Physics types on this list might accept this as a challenge to figure these
numbers out.
It's really in the realm of high school physics (at least in 1965, when I
took it!).
There are undoubtedly SAE papers on these very subjects. Are they online?
I know a few engineers at John Deere Engineering Center. I'll ask around. One
owes me a few favors.

&gt; As owner of a high milage (231,000 mi) engine, all this talk of
&gt; hydraulics made me wonder- does anyone know the specs for the minimum
&gt; oil pressure needed to make hydraulic lifters function to keep the valve
&gt; open as the cam pushes on the lifter?  Ie, if I'm tooling along at 20
&gt; psi on a hot day and 250 deg oil temp, is the lift on the valves
&gt; insufficient?  Can't say my power is less hot that when warming up.
&gt; However, sometimes (rarely) there can be lifter clatter after you stoip
&gt; a hot engine and restart it 15 min later, which I ascribe to thin oil
&gt; draining out of a lifter if the little hole in the side faces down?
