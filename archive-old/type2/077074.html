Dear Simon

The issue of how to create vacuum connections for the stock ignition 
distributor, on the 40mm, dual Kadron carburettors, was covered in some 
detail, in a past issue of VW trends, dating back a few years.

I have a copy of the article at home somewhere, but have no way of sending a 
copy by e-mail.

Regards.

        Nigel A. Skeet



&gt;Went and installed a pair of 40mm Kadron carbs on my 1600 dp, no vacuum! Do 
&gt;I need to tap the carbs for a vacuum port somewhere?

YES YOU DO

I need to know from someone that's done this before with these carbs.

YES, IN VW TRENDS MAGAZINE
