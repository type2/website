Subject: Westy paneling color?

I thought I was being cute today when I pulled out my panelling.  Sanded down
some pieces and even put polyurethane over.  But it doesn't match what I left
on board.  What's the stain on the paneling?  Is it some kind of Pecan or
some antiquing?  I want to get an exact match because most of my paneling is
salvageable.  Who has gone down this road before?
