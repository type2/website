Subject: 75 westy spare tire request

hi list - months and months ago a listee offered the spare tire for the 75
westy for sale. this is the tire that gets stored away under the sink
cabinet, and is blown up with the onboard air compressor. i am looking for
this rim, and would like to ask anybody who may have it to email me for
trade/cash deal.  i believe the deal ran two years, and included either 74
or 76.
 - steve
