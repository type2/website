&gt; Volkswagens don't have lug nuts. They have lug bolts, or more specifically
&gt; lug bolts that weld themselves to the brake drums.


Whoa, not true!  Vanagons have LUG NUTS on the front hubs and LUG BOLTS on
the rear hubs.
Yes, she has a 78 which has bolts at all 4 hubs but do not say &quot;Volkswagens
don't have lug nuts&quot;.
