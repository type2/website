Subject: Re: [T2] steering question

&gt; My '71 has very loose steering.  I have about 45 degrees of free play.
&gt;
&gt; Will adjusting the steering box fix this or is this a sign that more serious
&gt; work on the steering box is needed?


Probably not. Get an assistant to move the steering back and forth while
you have a look underneath and try to identify the location of the play.
Th steering box could be bad but it could also be in the drag link, tie
rods or center bushing. Its not very likely that that nuch play is just
steering box adjustment.
