Subject: Brake Cylinder Advice?

Hi, 

Another scene in my brake movie, if you do not mind:

PO broke one of the bleeder valves off.  I realized this as I 
was in the process of bleeding the system.

It's the Driver side rear, and I would welcome any advice. 
I would like to be able to unthread what's left of the valve,
and replace it without removing the wheel.  (I can't even get 
lug nuts off where it's parked, with the tools and muscle I have.)
(PO Obviously let a tire shop air wrench the lugs on...)

Anyway, I know the process of getting to the brake cylinder, and
I might as well take it apart, etc.... but if you suggest something
for a quick fix, I will try it.
