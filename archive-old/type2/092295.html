Subject: Right rear clicking sound....Crickets?

Hi Folks,

Just got back from a camping and noticed that there is a clicking noise
coming from the right rear wheel of our 72 westy (1700cc).  It occurs
only when the bus is in gear and is loudest at around 45-50 miles an
hour.  That is to say, if I take the bus out of gear at any speed the
noise goes away.

Where should I start?

Could it be the clutch and throw-out bearing?

CV joints?

Craig
