Subject: Stripping paint!

Well I jumped in to full on body work mode today. First order of business
was to fix a dent in the roof. Things couldn't of turned out worse, well one
thing led to the other and it turns out the whole roof front to back is
bondo!!Mind you not too thick only about 1/16 but never the less its all
coming off as I can't stand the thought of having this much bondo in my car.
I really do not know why some one put all this bondo on the roof as under
neath it is very straight  shiny metal! Some people should not be allowed to
touch there cars other than when they drive them and put gas in them! This
goes right along with my van engine that the guy thought was a two stroke!

    I'm looking  for some advice  on how you guys strip paint and bondo down
to the metal. I tried some chemical stripper I had around and it didn't do
much, tried a &quot;stripper wheel&quot; and I can do more with my teeth and faster
at that too, and I tried sanding. All of those methods are way slow and
unproductful. I have been having ok success with a small 4&quot; grinder and a
wire wheel on the end slowly taking the paint and bondo off, making sure not
to get things warm. Is there any other way that I can does this because so
far its taking what seems like and eternity. well thanks in advance! all fer
now
