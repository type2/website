Mark,

I have no wrap or cover at all. Should not be that way, but it is what I
have.  I have seen muffler wrap used, and have heard of rock wool being
used.  I think the covers are made of unobtanium ,and alas, completely
NLA.  I could live w2ithout the various insulating materials, but would
love to have the sheet metal covers back.  Air itself is a completely
satisfactory insulator in thicknesses of &lt; 1/8&quot; and completely fireproof
and non-carcinogenic.  I think intact covers alone would satify the heat
retention purpose.  Feel free to forward to the list if you feel it
appropriate
