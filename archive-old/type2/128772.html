Subject: Re: [T2] old? charcoal canister

Hiya cflesher,

Ill effects from hooking up an old charcoal canister?  Yeah, it wont work!

Here's the deal.  The charcoal canister is there to help scavenge, hold, and 
release hydrocarbons to be burnt in the carburetor.  It can't do that if it's 
plugged up with dirt or other contaminants.  So, how to tell if your canister 
is working (or not)?  Do this.......plug the small opening and then attempt to 
blow through the larger opening on the same end.  You should be able to do so 
easily.  If you have to force it or you simply cannot blow through the 
canister, it's time for a new one.

New ones (175 201 801A) are still available from your local VW dealer for 
about $65US.  Older ones (the metal ones - 113 201 801A) can be &quot;rehabilitated&quot; 
to work again for a lot cheaper than the price of a new one.
