Subject: [T2] taking a trip to mexico

Hello, this is Nisha up in Toronto,

        We just  bought a 76 V.W. bus because we are moving our family
down to San Miguel in Mexico next july. We are going to turn it into a
camper  over the winter but without the pop top. We are going to be
driving down the eastern seaboard and then across to New Orleans  then
Laredo Texas and on into Mexico.

    If any of you have any helpful tips for converting a 76 bus or any
suggestions as to routes or things that are interesting to see along the
way we would love to hear about it???
