Subject: Bus sighting on TV show &quot;COPS&quot;

Hey Volks!
    Just finished watching another exciting episode of the TV show
&quot;COPS&quot; and noticed a nice 73-74 or thereabouts.  Of course, it was on
fire BIG TIME!!!
    Seems this dilrod was fooling the carbs and left something undone.
When he got in to turn the motor over, gas went everywhere and a live
spark plug wire instantly ignited all the fumes.  Burned his neighbors
nice garage totally down!
    Lets all say a prayer for one less Bus that is on the road tonight!
