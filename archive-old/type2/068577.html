Hi Ben. The button that opens my engine hatch has locking key mechanism. I
got it from a '67 at the junkyard. It looks stock, so I don't think it is
an aftermarket item. I'm thinking about taking the lock # to the VW dealer
to get a key for it. Did they make similar locking engine hatch buttons for
baywindow buses? Finding one at the junkyard, then getting a key for it
would be both a simple and elegant solution to the engine locking issue.

Hi all,

I am just wondering if anyone has come up with good ideas for locking the
engine hatch.
