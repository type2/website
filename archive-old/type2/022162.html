Message-Id: &lt;4.1.19990516113304.00a823e0_at_pop-2.iastate_dot_edu&gt;

I managed to destroy the timing scale on my '81 vanagon.  I over-tightened
the fan cover &amp; the scale got caught up in the pulley... ripped the scale
to shreds.  Does anyone have a spare scale from a vanagon (or '78-'79
bus??) that they wouldn't mind getting rid of?  If so, please let me know.
