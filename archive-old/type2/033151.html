&gt; Wondering about using unleaded gasoline versus premium, I burned all
&gt; Texaco
&gt; unleaded (87 octane) on the outbound trip to Las Vegas and then
&gt; Texaco
&gt; premium (93 octane) on the return.  The gas out west was the winter
&gt; mix of
&gt; gas and alcohol.  The results were thus:
&gt; 
&gt; Marshall, TX to Las Vegas: 1757.5 miles, 103.2 gallons, 17.0 mpg.
&gt; Las Vegas to Marshall, TX: 1649.3 miles, 106.1 gallons, 15.5 mpg.
&gt; 
&gt; There seemed to be no difference at all in temperature, power, etc. 
&gt; There
&gt; is a substantial price difference between regular and premium though.
&gt; 
&gt; Does this mean I should be using the lower octane gasoline all the
&gt; time?

The only thing that higher octane does for you is prevent ping.  If
your engine doesn't ping, using premium is flushing dollars down the
toilet.

Different rules apply to engines with knock sensors, but that doesn't
include our VWs.
