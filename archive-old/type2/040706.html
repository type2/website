Subject: Re: [VB] Westy Website Year Questions

&gt; &gt; SOmeone questioned my estimate of tnhe date of the westybrochure page that
&gt; I created on http://members.xoom_dot_com/sglw/westybrochure
&gt; &gt;

As evidence I quote from page 2 of sams brochure.
&quot;...and for 1972 engine rating has been increased to 102.0 cu in...&quot;

Also

&quot;...The braking system is power assisted, up front disc brakes...&quot;


The pictures of older busses would have been available in 1972 but I
question if in 1970 they would have mentioned 1972 model year changes.
I say its a 1972 westy brochure irrespective of graphical content.
