Speaking from the &quot;I want my horn back&quot; camp:

I want my horn. I want it because I want to wake the person up who is
trying to come over into my lane while (combing hair, putting on makeup,
picking nose) and (talking on car phone, chatting with passenger, tuning
radio). I want it because the (kids, neighbors dog, cows) are in the road
and I want them to move. I want it because the garage door is (open,
closed) and I want my wife to (open, close) it.

This is why I sweat and swear my way through two weekends to determine why
my horn doesn't work. This is why I bust my tail to restore horndom to my
Microbus. This is why.....AAAAAARRRRRRGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!

Sorry.
