&gt;My philosophy on getting a new bus is that the best way to go about it is
&gt;to find the best body that you can.  Look for rust-free, look for
&gt;straight, look for a nice interior, look for &quot;all parts present.&quot;  I do
&gt;*not* look at mechanical condition.  Actually, I tend to look for *bad*
&gt;mechanical condition!  Blown engine?  Fine!  No brakes?  Wonderful!  
&gt;needs front end work? No problem!  I *love* a blown engine!  It drops the
&gt;price like a shot duck!

Did anyone at EB actually see Steve's '67????

Ok that was cheep.  But funny.
