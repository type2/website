Subject: rims

Who sells a nice stock looking chrome rim for a 73 Westy? I just bought some
new tires and thought that I would see if I could get the stock rims in chrome
instead of painting mine. I just took a quick look at bus boys and bus depot
and did not see them. I know they make them for bugs, but I think they are 15
inch.

Thanks,
Corbett
