Any marine engine supplier or repair facility should have these switches.  I
can't quote a price because I've never had to replace one.

In the Pacific Northwest I'd recommend Doc Freeman's in Seattle or TD&amp;E in
Tacoma...

&gt;&gt;  Where do you get those, and how much are they?  This sounds like a good
thing to have on a VW; if you lose oil pressure (leakage, oil pump quits
working, whatever) the engine would shut down as a
self-preservation measure.  &lt;&lt;
