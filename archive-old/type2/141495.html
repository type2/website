Subject: RE: [T2] Boge Shocks for $18 Each!

&gt;&gt; We just bought some Boge shocks on closeout for only $17.95
&gt;&gt; each...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  the AlKo's (which are perhaps the best value for dollar in my
&gt;&gt;  opinion),


&gt; A|Ko's still the best value with the IP/Boge deal?

&gt; busdepot website is currently down.


The closeout Boges are a heck of a deal for under $20. But if you have the
money to spend, the Alko's are worth the price difference. They give you a
glimpse of Koni performance (minus the adjustability) for a price point
between those two options. Not that they're equal to the Koni's, but they do
get you a good part of the way there for about half the price. A good
&quot;middle ground&quot; between the two price extremes, in other words. It really
depends on your budget. Both are oil-filled shocks and will not be as
hard-riding as the KYB's.

We are trying to switch to a new server tonight, so BusDepot_dot_com may be up
and down overnight. Should be solved by morning (god willing!) if not
sooner.
