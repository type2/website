Subject: Re: Dormobile skylight seals

Hey y'all
I recently went through this.  Posted about it a couple weeks ago.  You
can use rear window seals for a mid 60's bus, you have to cut about 18&quot;
off it, glue the ends together with superglue, install carefully and
caulk it with silicone.  Mine didn't leak at all at Soggybus er
Everybus.  I'm still looking for the real thing, still no answer from
Dormobile (http://www.dormobile_dot_com but I haven't given up yet.
