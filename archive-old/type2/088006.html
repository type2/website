Subject: Re: [T2] Re:*&amp;(%!! vandals smashed the side window on my Westy. 

&quot;yes. do yourself a favor &amp; just get a one-piece glass like is on the =
other
side.  the seal is cheaper &amp; you won't have any rust issues with the =
little
vent wing window.&quot;

Only problem with this is it gets hotter then Hell back there in the =
summer-not fair to rear seat passengers. I did this on my old bus =
because the seal was NLA at the time- I believe it is available now.   =
