Subject: [T2] Free stuff friday, pick up in San Fran now!!!!

Hi,

I just moved into a place with no garage so I need to get this stuff out of 
the back of my bus as quick as possible... all of it is in wonderful 
condition, id sell it but my need to get it out of the way is greater..

What I have :

Rear westy cabinets. The roof part and the side thing. The little mirror is 
there, and all of the doors latch shut real nice.

Rear bench seat from a 75. This is in great great shape, no tears at all, 
and the springs are in decent shape.

Email me and let me know how soon you could swing over and take it off of my 
hands. If it makes you feel better about getting all of this wonderful stuff 
for free, bring me a 6er and we'll call it even!

Thanks!

Christopher

everything else passed. any ideas? im officially illegal till I can pass...
