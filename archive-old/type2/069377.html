Subject: Re: Battery Box

&gt;What kind of battery box do you recommend (other than the large marine style)?

I don't know if &quot;recommend&quot; is the correct term but i have heard of people
using an old antifreeze (or similar sized container) successfully. Simply
lay the container on its side, and cut one side of the container out. Pu
tht e batter inside the cutout, it is supposed to work well and is free. As
far as I know on a 78' it would have never had a container that it came w/
only a metal strap to hold it doen. On the old 6 volt busses they had this
metalish tray that secured on to the top of the battery.
