Hey list, last week I decided to replace the orange vinyl door panels in my
74 westy with nice birch plywood. Well that turned into all new
carpeting,sub floor, and birch plywood throughout the van. This week I'm
thinking of leaving the stove and fridge out of the bus. I like the fact
that theres more room, I dont really see myself cooking in the van, and a
nice ice chest takes up so little room. So I'm thinking of trading my
original stove and fridge. Heres what Im looking for, a 1974 Westfalia
manual, a westy tent, some type of gas heater. Let me know what you have to
trade. Or should I hang on to the unit?
