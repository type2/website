Subject: FYI: Yokohama LT370 Tires

Volks:
Just for your information, from all sources that I attempted, Yokohama
has stopped production of the famed Y370LT 195/75/14D tire that so many
were fond of :-(.  Yoko headquarters did mention a close replacement,
but sounds more like the Y356 highway tread.

On a good note, yesterday I found a 185/75/14 D commercial tire with an
aggressive M+S tread, for $57 ea. It's made for the little bob truck
that office supply, etc. companies use with dual rear wheels. I'll post
opinions when I have them:)
