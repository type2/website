Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Depot Quality = Good!

To all those who unmericfully pick on the Bus Depot,
need to stop it.  I love the bus depot.  I buy almost
everything from the bus depot, because they sell
quality components and I don't want that to ever
change.  So if you don't like buying the good stuff,
then how about going to motorworks_dot_com and leave Ron
alone.

Cheers to Ron and the Bus Depot
Blah to all those nah-sayers
