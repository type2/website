Subject: RE: [T2] Overheating? How can you tell?

&gt;I only see this at temps significantly above
220*F

Mine doesn't flicker ever, but I use nothing
lighter than 30W oil (and my bearings are new and
tight).  Also, I hear a lot of people claiming
they use very thin oils such as 10W30 (gasp) or
5W30 (eeeeek!).  Obviously, the thinner the oil,
the lower the oil pressure especially at high
temps.
