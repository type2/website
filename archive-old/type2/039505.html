Subject: Unusual problem

Hello, Type 2 List.

I am resubscribing to get some help with a problem my son has with his '71
camper.

Apparently his bus was successfully vandalized last Halloween.  WE found
and removed an egg from the gas tank filler pipe, but it seems one or more
eggs made it into the tank.  Shortly after putting the bus back on the
road last month, the thing died.  The garage found a clogged filter.  Bus
was fine.  Four days later it died again.  Filter again.  MEchanic thinks
we are seeing the result of a successfully egging.

Question is this - can the tank be adequately in place by disconnecting
the fuel line, draining the tank, flushing somehow (insert a steam wand
into the filler pipe?), then reconnecting?

The mechanic says the tank can't be removed without removing the engine,
so we're looking for less labor-intensive solutions.

Thanks for any comments/ideas.

Since this is so unusual, you might want to send private replies.  (Don't
know how busy the list is, now that it's split.)

Regards,
Don Sugarman
