That was about what I figured the Van was suffering from PO Ignoramus
Syndrome.

&gt; Volks,
&gt; Had a couple of hours this afternoon to really get into the nitty 
&gt; gritty of my no start problem. Found problem, but will share the 
&gt; steps for those that have similar issues.
&gt; 
&gt; decided to run 12v wire direct from battery to terminal 50 of the 
&gt; starter solenoid............turned key on, and touched the lead to 
&gt; the battery positive side, started right up.
&gt; 
&gt; Next decided to trace wire from connector at base of ignition switch 
&gt; (used Bentley for info) found a 4 wire coupler under dash.    I 
&gt; tried to jumper wire from 12v in connector at base of ignition 
&gt; switch to terminal 30 in the same connector, and no start.  Then i 
&gt; disconnected the 4 wire terminal, and jumpered 12v to the terminal 
&gt; 30 wire and it started right up.  This told me I had a bad lead from 
&gt; the 4 wire connector to the connector on the ignition switch.  I 
&gt; removed the wire from the ignition switch, and discovered the PO had 
&gt; rigged another wire in there to get a key on + lead for 
&gt; something.........  removed wire connector, crimped on new one, and 
&gt; the car starts per stock design now.

&gt; &gt;I will accept the flack on this...... You don't need no stinking 
&gt; second
&gt; &gt;solenoid. Its a patch not a fix.
&gt; &gt;------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; (Here's a flack jacket for you, Stan. Good line!!)
&gt; 
&gt; Just as the relay kits are a panacea for old wires.
&gt; Wires/terms/switches/solinoids/armatures/brushes/bearings get 
&gt; resistant
&gt; with age, just like us. &quot;click-click&quot; for start is many times a 
&gt; synergy of
&gt; weaknesses throughout the circuit.  The closer you are to stock, the 
&gt; better
&gt; your &quot;luck&quot; (pocket book) is in the future. Patching is for getting 
&gt; back
&gt; home so you can remove the offense with proper follow up repair. 
&gt; Most/all
&gt; the time/money spent on patching is no longer available to fix it 
&gt; right. So
&gt; patching is for emergencies only, like when brokedown in 
&gt; Gooberburg.
&gt; 
&gt; Let's say I'm 2000 miles from home and suddenly, &quot;click-click&quot; no 
&gt; starter.
&gt; Let's say I determine that the starter solinoid is showing it's age 
&gt; as
&gt; resistance and must be replaced to fix it properly, but I can't get 
&gt; a REAL
&gt; one in Hicksville until too late for my needs, and I most needs to 
&gt; not
&gt; spend three days in Elroy and Mona's Kafe with the local-necks that 
&gt; hang
&gt; out there and have fun makin' fun of &quot;furren&quot; cars at your expense. 
&gt; I would
&gt; go to NAPA and get a pushbutton and 20 feet of 10ga wire and 
&gt; terminals and
&gt; make up direct connections at the starter, just run the wires on the 
&gt; floor
&gt; to between the front seats for the pushbutton. Now I have guaranteed 
&gt; lower
&gt; voltage drop than the old wires/terms to actuate the old starter
&gt; dependably, and have spent only $20/20 minutes. Then pop in a 
&gt; new/reman
&gt; BOSCH starter when I get home, and take off the jurusrigusmortus 
&gt; and
&gt; salvage the hardware for future value in some way so the 
&gt; jerryricketsmongus
&gt; is not a total loss. Like maybe then actually replacing the old 
&gt; switch
&gt; wires properly shielded and routed to remove another weakness to 
&gt; insure
&gt; longer life for the new starter.
