&gt; &gt; ...I am asking for help in FINDING the source of the odor.  It is the
&gt; &gt; strangest thing. The odor seems to be most prominent in the FRONT of the
&gt; &gt; bus.  There is absolutely NO gas odor in the engine compartment.
&gt; 
&gt; Could it be possible that the fuel is leaking from a connection at/near the
&gt; tank and is dripping down onto one of the ducts bringing air up from the
&gt; heater boxes?  Kind of a wierd scenario, maybe, but it *could* result in
&gt; gas fumes in tha cab but no smell in the engine compartment.

When the hose connecting the filler tube to my tank was leaking there was no smell in the 
engine compartment but you could smell gas in the cab (stronger smell for the passenger than 
the driver).  However the gas smell was strongest in the rear of the bus.
