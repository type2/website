&gt; &gt; one at a time.  I'm running on three cylinders. #4 is out of commision.
I
&gt; &gt; replaced the plug and the wire with no difference. Is this a stuck
valve?
&gt; &gt; The compression is o.k. at 100 in high altitude on that cylinder same as
&gt; &gt; the others. What's the story.
&gt;
&gt; check your fuel injector on that cyl.  is the plug wet??  is the injector
&gt; stuck or clogged, is it getting a trigger signal.  maybe the balancing
&gt; resistor is bad for that cyl.
&gt;
&gt; you need to determine if it is fuel or fire. and then back track from
&gt; there to the problem
