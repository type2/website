I think I'll pressurize the system tomorrow or the next day before removing 
any components and see if I spot a leak.

&gt; I would guess that you developed a very small hailine crack in the plastic 
&gt; on the cold start valve.  I've seen a few with little &quot;craze&quot; marks in the 
&gt; moulding.  I think the leak was small since not much burned but at 20 psi 
&gt; it can't help but spray out getting the distributor area.  If a fuel line 
&gt; had ruptured i think that you would have a had a couple of litres spilled 
&gt; before you could do anything and the engine would be slag now.
