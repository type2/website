Subject: flaps and tstat

hello all,
I have my motor out (again), this time for a tranny overhaul.  the 
growling has finally gotten to me over the past 5 years.  Anyway, since 
i have motor out, i am interested in putting in the missing air flaps 
and thermostat.  does anyone have or know where to get a good set of 
flaps, rods, springs hardware and all?  Have way too much mayonaisse 
(sp?)  on underside of oil cap.  I am also going to re-torque the 
heads.  Anything i should be looking for?  Thanks.

David
