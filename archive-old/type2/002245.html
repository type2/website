&gt; So, I cancelled the order.  I put my trust in Bus Depot and they let me
&gt; down.  RMMW, here I come.

Same exhaust system the other person was waiting for. (See my last post.)
Same reason for the delay - RMMW.  If they do have their sh*t together again
like they say they do, maybe you will get the parts quickly if you re-order
&gt;from them (for more money).  But had you ordered from them last week, I
doubt you'd have had any better luck than I did.  This is why I'm looking
elsewhere for the time being until I know they have their problems solved.

Again, I need to reiterate.  We do our best to accommodate rush orders.  But
there is a reason why my website says to allow about 7 working days for
delivery.  Sometimes delays happen.
