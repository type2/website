Subject: Re: working on your van under difficult conditions

Just thought I should share my difficult conditions scenario.  What
follows is an account of the WORST conditions I've repaired my bus
under.

A few summers back we drove my '72 Sportsmobile camper to Washington DC
to see a concert (They Might Be Giants at the 9:30 club).  After the
concert, I noticed that I couldn't get the bus into first gear.  The
idea of trying to fix this problem in north-east DC at 2:15am wasn't
exactly my idea of fun.  Since it was late, and we faced mostly highway
driving once we got out of DC, we set out in second instead. 
Unfortunately, after a few blocks of driving, the shift coupling
completely detached - leaving me no option but to perform a roadside
repair.

Using only 3rd gear, I pulled into the only place that had lights on (by
now it was around 2:30am) - a gas station.  I crawled under the bus
while the homeless people and rats circled us.  My wife was looking very
nervous as several shady characters approached us.  I told these
nocturnal visitors that I had the situation under control but thanks for
their concern.  They watched from across the street as I slid under the
bus.

When I looked up I could see that the bolt from the shift coupling was
gone.  I spent a few minutes looking around the bus for a bolt that
would fit.  I finally found a reasonable substitute - a bolt from the
bumper was the right size and had the right thread!  A bit of work with
a file and I reduced the end of the bolt to a crude but effective point
that would fit into the little dimple on the transmission's shift rod. 
After about 15 minutes of brainstorming and a few turns of the vice
grips, we were on our way again.

Quick thinking and having the right tools got us out of a pretty rotten
situation.  Just goes to show how well we all can perform when we have
proper motivation. ;-)
