Subject: [T2] Voltage Regulator Question

Hi folks, a quick question: What is the difference between the voltage 
regulator used with the 55amp. alt. as opposed to the 70amp alt? Will using 
the 55amp reg. with a 70amp alt. cause trouble, or is it just a matter of 
better RF shielding in the 70amp reg.?
Thanks, 
Robb
