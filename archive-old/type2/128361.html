&gt; If your engine is not firing but you are getting gas make sure you have

Wow! Not only was I a few &quot;degrees off terrible timing&quot;, I don't know what the 
heck I was smoking when I put the spark plug wires on...I had cylinder 3 
firing at TDC and the wires were going around the distributor the wrong way. 
Anyway, fixed all that and drove the bus to work this morning. She purrs like 
a kitten. Sweet. Thanks for the tips...
