&gt;Ken, when switching from 009 to single vac, the drive gear should be turned,
&gt;(I THINK it's 2 teeth counterclockwise) tho' switching the wires, as Dave
&gt;says, will do til you get a chance to move it. Having a senior-moment right
&gt;now, so can't remember why moving the gear is the &quot;right&quot; way.

Well, let me know if you remember because I can't see why it would matter
(although obviously it gets extra points for style =^ ). Copying the lists,
Marv, I hope you don't mind.

I'm having trouble tuning it in. The advance works smoothly under a strobe,
and it starts and drives ==okay== but it's pretty boggy. It's worse than
the 009 in a 009 sort of way, if you know what I mean. I thought the
problem was flooding by the accelerator pump, which was set up to
compensate for the 009 by shooting neat gas in by the pint, but by fussing
with the acc pump I could only improve things so much.

What did seem to help was to advance the timing to a somewhat alarming
degree. Tomorrow I'll take it on the highway and play work-up with it.

Tenacious in the pursuit of throttle response I remain,
