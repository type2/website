Subject: [T2] replacing dash lights / or repairing dash light wiring

Hola,

so the new 75 westy has zero working dash lights except the little ones 
behind the head and air controls (arent those usually the first to go?) so I 
was thinking of tackling that one of these days but im a little nervous.

I was ready to pull the display portion of the dash out when I realized how 
many wires are back there connected to the dash. Geez, am i ever going to be 
able to get it all back together the way it went. Whats a good procedure to 
get everything back where it came from?


somehow mark each wire before I pull it as to where it was?

It seemed at fist like a quick job, but when I first saw that mess back 
there I thought perhaps I should leave well enough alone?

any thoughts/suggestions on the matter are appreciatted.
