&gt; **You know that you have TOTALLY lost it when...  **

Well, maybe not me, but what about when:

Your FAMILY joins in the searches.  We see Vanagons all the time, so 
the kids look for different VERSIONS and paint schemes.  They are 
always saying, &quot;Geesh, we see Vanagons EVERYWHERE we go!&quot;

I get to educate them on the various loafs and splits too.

Not only that, the spottin's have spilled over into other Volkswagens.

My WIFE joined in when they spotted a Volkswagen Rabbit truck.  The 
were checking it out big time, as they thought it was a custom 
modification job.  They were all excited about it when they told me.

The kids are already planning how they want to modify the *parts* 
Westi in the yard for use as a playhouse.  And one of them is 
expecting to fix up the Squareback when he gets older.
