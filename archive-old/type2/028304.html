&gt; Bus Depot agreed to correct a situation with which I was unsatisfied. I
&gt; appreciate that however
&gt;
&gt; I called BD this morning to see when the replacement order that I had
placed
&gt; on 10.2.00 was shipped. Not only had it not been shipped but there was no
&gt; record of it at all. I was assured that the order would ship today but
that
&gt; it what I was told last week. I asked to have them call me back with a UPS
&gt; tracking # and they said NO!  I asked if I could be called
&gt; back to confirm that the order was in fact processed and shipped today and
&gt; they said NO! I asked if I could give them my UPS account # so I
&gt; could have the order shipped next day air and billed to my account(which
by
&gt; the way was goind to be $2.00 cheaper then what I was going to pay BD for
UPS ground)
&gt; and they said NO!.


You purchased an extractor system that rusted out on you, and asked for an
exchange. No problem.  But this was way back in July. We agreed to exchange
it for a better system for the difference in price, because you felt (and I
agree) that another Empi system would probably do the same thing. This is
why I always recommend the O.E. system, despite the difference in price. But
you never followed through with the exchange.

Then, two months later, you asked if we would still honor the exchange that
we had offered you months earlier.  You didn't have the box or packing
anymore, meaning we very possibly will not be able to get credit from the
manufacturer and will have to take an $80 loss, but still we said yes.  Many
other companies would have declined to honor the exchange two months after
requested, or allowed only an exchange for another of the identical item,
but we agreed to stand by it and send you the better system as requested.

The order placed 10/3 had not shipped as of 10/11, but would have (and will)
arrive within the 7-10 day working day timeframe we promise.  You waited two
months to exchange the unit, so one would think that you were not in a huge
rush, but yes, it will arrive within the time frame we specify.  The reason
that the clerk could not find the invoice originally is that he did not know
we were shipping an exchange that was first authorized two months earlier.
He simply had not searched that far back.  But the order was indeed in the
pipeline and scheduled to go out.

No, we do not call people back with tracking numbers.  We simply do not have
time!  Sue me if you think this is out of line, but my first priority is
getting my customers orders out.  You are more than welcome to call the
following day if you'd like the tracking number.  Paul had assured you that
it would go out today, and I just checked on it and it already has.

We also cannot bill shipments to other people's UPS accounts.  We have been
burned on this.  If the other company denies that they authorized the bill
to be sent to them, gives us a bogus account number, or simply doesn't pay
it, UPS goes after us.  We had a $60 freight bill go to collections, against
my credit record, because the customer who said &quot;bill my account&quot; gave us a
closed account number, and the shipping company reverted the charge back to
us. I had to fight with them for two months to set my credit record
straight. Never again.  By the way, if you ask any other mail order company
to ship a product and bill it to your UPS account, they will also say no. I
have never heard of any mail order or internet retailer doing this.

It seems to me that rather than complaining, you should be complimenting us
for offering you a &quot;hassle free&quot; full exchange on a product several months
after purchase, well after our posted return policy.
