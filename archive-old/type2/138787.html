Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon hydraulic clutch questions &amp; engine install

&gt; I can't speak to a lot of your issues, but sometimes the splines won't
&gt; mate because you need to turn the crankshaft slightly to get it to
&gt; line up. Transmission in neutral can help too.

Thanks John,
I'm Kinda past the problem with the throwout bearing, Tied the clutch lever 
up with a heavy cord for now to keep the T. O. bearing out of the way. I 
suspect there is still air in the line. I'll Try pressure bleeding it in the 
morning. Had to give up for the evening when my shop light burned out. I 
think I just need to get the input shaft to line up with the pilot bearing 
and I'll be home free.
