Subject: Time to sell my 70 bug.

I've cross posted this to the lists I'm active on, so although not Type2
related, it is an air-cooled brother.

I've reached the point in age and health where I've decided a few things have
to move on in my life so I can devote decent time to the few things I should
be spending more time with. I've narrowed it down to my 77 Westy for now and
my motorcycle, so my beloved 70 bug is looking for a new home. It is situated
in Nanaimo, BC. It is in very very good condition and although it could be
returned to stock, as I have the parts, it now sports a lowered front end with
a ghia disc brake system, Porsche 2L alloy wheels and 60 series tires, and new
interior except for the headliner which is still great. I also have all the
parts for a 2276CC engine sitting on my workbench that I've lost interest in,
so it can be part of the deal if you like go fast stuff. I have a myriad of
parts that will tag along with it as well. The car and engine can be separate
sales, or cheaper if bought together. 44idf webers, hand ported DK 044 heads
etc etc, lots of big buck stuff.
The car has it's stock 1200 engine in it, with an obnoxious flat spot off of
idle that I haven't gotten around to fixing, so parked it last summer under
it's cover. Email me for pics and particulars idiosyncrasies of a 36 year old
car. :-) I reckon about 4K for the car alone, or 6K for it and the engine. The
heads alone were 600 dollars. That's Canuck bucks too you 'Mericans. :-)

Regards,
Courtney
