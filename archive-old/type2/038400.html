Subject: Removing broken heater box studs

Dear all,

In removing the right heater box from my 1979 Westy, I broke two
studs.  The two studs are now too short for me to re-attach the heater
box.

I have tried to use vise grips to remove and replace the studs.  
A NAPA salesman suggested that I use heat to remove the stud.  Does anyone 
have
any ideas or experience on removing the studs?

Thanks,
