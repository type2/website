&gt; The flywheel lock with a flex plate is REALLY simple.... Just use a

&gt; one of the motor mount bolts. This will keep the flex plate from
&gt; turning enough to torque the bolts up to spec, or to remove them.

right, although I have never needed anything to tighten or loosen the
bolts that hold the flex plate
