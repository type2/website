 Oh, wise list.
 
 I have been running a power pulley on my Baja for many years with no 
 problems.  Everybody seems to think it is wrong to use one on the street, 
 but the early Porsches used a pulley about this size.
 
 The temp seems to stay the same with the power pulley and I get a little 
 extra horsepower at the wheels.
 
 Does anyone know of any studies that prove if a power pulley really causes 
 overheating? Back in &quot;the day&quot; all of my VW buddies ran them with no 
 problem. Of course, none of us had Busses.

&quot;power pulley&quot; theory is that you have a smaller crank pulley and you 
dont&quot;waste&quot;power turning the generator.   

however, many people don't think this is so groovey, prefering to consider it 
not a waste to turn the generator and also the fan. The fan, of course, blows 
the air to cool the motor. 

 Considering the power used for gen/fan would not turn the wheels all that 
much, the latter theory may well have some value.

myself, I prefer to use the larger crank pulleys on my own engines.   You 
see, VW made stock pulleys in at least 6 sizes, a certain amount of variation.
