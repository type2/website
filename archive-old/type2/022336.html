Have her help you remove the engine some Saturday for anything - like 
replacing a gasket or cleaning the fins and then tell her you think it 
maybe related to the high rpms she insists driving at.

Make sure she busts plenty of her knuckles and gets filthy and followed but 
completely tired out. Then causally mention how glad you are that you guys 
don't have to open up the motor - that could cost thousands......

If she doesn't get the picture then I would force her to ride shotgun 
forever. I mean, which is more important - your girlfriend's feelings or 
your bus engine? Easy choice I think! &lt;grin&gt;

&gt;hi all. here's a problem i'm sure many of you have
&gt;encountered: my girlfriend and i bought a '77 westy
&gt;together. it runs well, but i'm afraid it won't run well
&gt;for long the way she drives it. no matter how many times i
&gt;scold her for overrevving the motor, she simply cannot pay
&gt;attention to the rpms. she frequently pushes 60 in third
&gt;gear. i can keep a watch on her when we're both in the car,
&gt;but who knows what evils she perpetrates on our poor bus
&gt;when i'm not around. the only solution i can think of is to
&gt;install a tach that sounds an alarm when the rpms get above
&gt;a certain level. i think an annoying screech every time the
&gt;motor is overrevving would probably cure her bad driving
&gt;habits. has anybody heard of such a device? if not, do you
&gt;have any other technical solutions? forget about trying to
&gt;get her to drive better - it won't happen.
&gt;
&gt;peace,
&gt;ben
