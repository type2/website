Subject: CDI rotors

I have a Petronix Ignitor that says on the block inside the distributor, 
carb   EO,  D-67 2.  The rotor is brown with a black material between the 
rotor and the coil contact patch.  Since I bought it used and complete, is 
this possibly a Petronix rotor, and there fore ok for long use, so I do not 
have to modify it as Mr Heulsman article suggests?  Thanks
Sid
