Subject: Re: [T2] Doh!!! I fried my F.I. wiring harness

I'm really sorry to hear this. It happened to me once, although not in the
same place, and I know your heart must have just stopped. I now treat the
electrical system with great respect and double check my work before
reconnecting the battery.

&gt; What I need now
&gt; is the section of the wiring harness that plugs into
&gt; the left side of the double relay. This section goes
&gt; through the fire wall and connects to the fuel pump as
&gt; well as the starter. It also has a black wire that
&gt; connects to the coil.

It's not really part of the FI loom: you can remove the loom and still leave
that plug connected to the double relay. If that's all that's fried I think
you got off lucky and can either run new wires or find a bundle and plug
from a donor bus.

&gt; This section of the wiring
&gt; harness is NOT the one with all white wires. I am not
&gt; exactally sure which year model bus this F.I. came
&gt; from. For reference sake, the part number for the ECU
&gt; is: 
&gt; 
&gt; 022 906 021 S
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe someone could figure what year it came from
&gt; using that part number.

From the archives:

CU 57 X         022 906 021 S

ECU,  CU 57 X
   Volkswagen
     1977     Type 2 1970cc (CJ,GD,GE) Manual Transmission

The harnesses vary according to the features. I think I have this right:

- 75-76 1/2 harness (throttle body switch, vacuum can EGR, 6 pin AFM)
- 76 1/2 harness (micro-switch, mechanical EGR, 7 pin AFM)
- 77-78 (+ 79 Fed) harness (mechanical EGR, 7 pin AFM)
- 79 CA harness (O2 sensor, resistor pack built into harness instead of
module on firewall, 7 in AFM).
