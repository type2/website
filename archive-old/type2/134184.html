Subject: RE: [T2] Aftermarket Fuse Boxes -70

Thanks Chris,

The 70 Fuse box must be cursed.  I've not seen one that isn't destroyed!  I
do have a 71 box that is very similar, just had to switch a couple of bottom
jumpers around for the same config.  Problem is that the plugins on the
bottom are not the same. However, the box seems like it is made from
different materials.   Oh well, I'll figure something out!

&lt;anyone know of a source of aftermarket fuse boxes for our
buses&gt;

Direct plug in? No.

Good aftermarket solution? Go to the grocery store and find a copy of the
Street Rodder, Street Scene, etc. magazine. You'll have alot of fitting and
cutting to do but I've used an aftermarket fuse panel in a street rod with
excellent results.

Alternative: Napa has generic blade type fuse boxes. Advance Auto had the
same 6 circuit panel for 50% less and it appeared to be the same
manufacturer. This was 2 years ago. You might be able to get a larger than 6
circuit panel.

Alternative: RV catalogs or Marine catalogs.

Document your alteration so you can explain it to the next owner though...
&lt;grin!&gt;
