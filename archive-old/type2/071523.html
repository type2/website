I've heard that you can use the Vanagon belts also, but you need to be careful
about the materials you use and the stress rating of the bolts and hardware.
Never use belts off a wrecked vehicle.  The stress on the belt during the
accident may have damaged it to the point that it will fail when you need it
most.

Any time you change the mounting location or hardware on your seatbelts, you
take the risk that they may no longer perform as they were engineered.  This
is the main reason I went with the Mexican belts.  At least they will bolt up
the same way they were designed to.  The fact that you have to change to
longer bolts should not make any difference as long as the replacement bolts
are rated the same as the originals.

Of course even with the new Mexican belts, I give no guarantee that they will
perform as well as the originals.  In fact, I will go out of my way to say
that you use these at your own risk.

&lt;&lt; For those interested in a lower priced alternative, get some Vanagon
 seatbelts from the junkyard and fabricate a simple &quot;L&quot; bracket out of 3/16&quot;
 steel (available for a few dollars at hardware stores) for the lower mount.
  I did this and it works well and is also made up of genuine VW parts,
 except for the bracket.  You can use the existing upper seatbelt mount bolt
 or use a longer one and make a spacer so it will pivot.  It does not pivot
 with the stock, short bolt but I secured it at a 45 degree angle and it
 works fairly well that way if you're careful about how you pull it.
 Someday I will make the spacer so it can pivot again, but even as it is,
 it's miles ahead of the stock belts, which everyone agrees are a royal PITA.
