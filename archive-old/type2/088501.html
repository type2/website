Subject: Re: [T2] Troy's engine problem of the day.....Update

I had this problem on my 69'. The shims in the bottom of the dizzy wore out
and the whole shaft could easly move up and down and would not catch on the
shaft in the engine. Pull out the dizzy and take a look see.

&gt; While looking for any possible sign of stupid mistakes I may have made,
&gt; I found that I was actually able to rotate the rotor by hand in either
&gt; direction.  So is it not grabbing down at the bottom of the shaft?  Or
&gt; is it supposed to do that?  Thanks.
