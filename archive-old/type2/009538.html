&gt;Before anyone says 20/50 is the best thing since sliced bread....
&gt;If you look at a &quot;Engine Oil Viscosity Specification&quot; chart and compare temp 
&gt;ranges, you will see 20/50 craps out at 80†. There is one on page 5 of 
&gt;section 9 of the 68-79 Bentley. Also in bus owners manuals. Bob in Texas 
&gt;talked of driving in 110 degree temps. Here in Fresno, Calif., the summers 
&gt;usually have 30 to 40 days with temps 100-110. The temp range for 40 weight 
&gt;is 68 to over 100† [the chart stops at 40c/103f]. Even a Mercedes owners 
&gt;manual [85] says &quot;SAE 40 may be used if ambient temeratures constantly 
&gt;exceed +30†C/+86†F&quot;.
&gt;The operating range of 20/50 is 15F to 80F. This would be the range across 
&gt;the northern part of the U S, but Bob was talking about driving across the 
&gt;southwest.
&gt;
&gt;

     I'm hardly an expert here, but I've been told, and it makes sense, 
that oil's come a long way since Bently published those specs. 
Incidentally, the same chart exists on my '78 owners manual, so this is 
pretty old data, I wouldn't be surprised if oil is better made these 
days. 

     For those that don't have bentley-get it. But, you can look at what 
it says here (posted it a few years back when the thread came up):
