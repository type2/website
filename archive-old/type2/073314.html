Subject: RE: have i been screwed?
Message-Id: &lt;v04011700b399d0361477_at_[4.16.26.41]&gt;

it was Big O Tires, in Prescott Valley, AZ. To top it all off, i called up
their store in Prescott [15 miles away], and they quoted me an excessive
[but much cheaper] $231 for the pair. I've sent an email to Big O, and i've
also called my credit card company to dispute it. one good thing, and what
may get me out of this, is that they never had me sign the work order,
which authorizes them to charge me. I've had disputes with car repair
places in the past, but the credit card company couldn't do anything
because i signed the release [a catch-22, you need to sign that to get your
keys back and drive your car home, but if you have a problem, you shouldn't
sign it].

i must admit, i'm very happy with the tires i ended up getting from them -
205/70 R14's, and the bus rides like a dream now. well worth it. i just
hope they'll make good on this. since i just got the bus, and i don't have
a lot of time to get it home before my vacation is over, i decided it would
be best to have people who know what they're doing handle things like the
brakes and the first tune-up. that way i would know where things stand when
i start doing it all myself.

i really feel like they saw that i was willing to spend a decent amount of
money on new tires, and that i'm real far from home, so they jacked up the
price. that's weak.

&gt;I've even found aftermarket rotors for my '72 for about $35 each and
&gt;they're NLA in most FLAPS.

&gt;&gt;&gt; $184/rotor, just for the rotor. this didn't include the pads,
&gt;&gt;&gt; labor or tax!  If it's really ridiculously off, i'm going to raise
&gt;&gt;&gt; a stink, since i had it done at a large chain.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I sell them for less than $50, and that's for original-equipment ATE's.  I
&gt;&gt;know local places can't compete with mail order prices, but almost 4 times
&gt;&gt;the price seems really excessive to me. In fact I've never heard of anyone
&gt;&gt;paying that much for a bus rotor, and customers tell me horror stories about
&gt;&gt;price gouging all the time.  If I were you, I'd certainly raise a stink.
