Subject: Re: [T2] Send me your favorite routes

I'd like to suggest that when talking about a route, the vehicle year,
engine, fuel system, etc, are listed as well. For example, I know
several routes I love to take in my 78 (2.0, FI) that were a nightmare
in my 73 hightop (1800, dual carb). Differences in power, gearing,
weight, etc.

Just as another factor, of course.
