Subject: Re: [T2] Charcoal can function?


&gt;function of the charcoal can, to remove gas fumes from the engine 
&gt;compartment?
&gt;OR should the other end of the hose going to the charcoal can be connected 
&gt;to
&gt;something, and if so, WHAT?

I think your assumption is logical, but incorrect.  If you remove the hose 
from the fan shroud, you will discover not vacuum, but + pressure.  This 
'blows' air into the charcoal canister, which is then routed to your air 
cleaner.  This creates a vacuum inside the canister, drawing vapors from 
within the fuel filler/tank, and burning the fuel rather than allowing it to 
escape into the atmosphere.
