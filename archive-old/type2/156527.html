Subject: Re: [T2] bike racks

a friend of mine uses fork mounts or also called blockheads that are mounted to his trailer ... before his trailer though he had thse mounted to the top of his pop top i think with a 2 X 4.... worked really well for him....and he did it right.... so it didnt mess the top up....
  course he is a very large person so wasnt to much trouble to get them down...
  i also have a little trailer that i will be putting these on for our mountain bikes...

  We bought two bike racks at Canadian tire and had a very good welder make frame 
for the front and back.

He then modified the racks to support the bikes.

I checked the weight of the vehicle and it was 100 kg below GAWVR at a truck 
scale.

These vans are trucks, I thing they can take it. I inflated the tire to tire 
spec of 45 psi and I burned a lot of rubber of them this trip.

I put the lightest bikes on the back.

Next bikes will be smaller and lighter.
