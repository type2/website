Subject: Re: radio, install

Tip: The previous radio was the old type bolted just to the face of the
dashboard. The new one fitted in slot but was not secured to the dashboard.
So I used a bent metal strip, bolted one end to the back of the radio and
the other end to a couple of holes conveniently pre-drilled in the top
centre part of the dashboard.

Question: The new radio is longer than the old one and impinges behind on
the heating/ventilation control cables which are now under strain and a bit
bent - will this do much harm in the long run?

&gt; I'm planning to remove the PO's am-only blaupunkt (spelling?)
&gt; radio from my '82 vanagon and replace with an am-fm-tape-playing radio 
&gt; and need to know if there are any tricks to installing same. I note that
&gt; Joel has written something about getting to the aerial and this is duly
&gt; noted.  Any other tips or warnings?  Thanks, Art
