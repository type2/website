&lt;&lt; Why would anyone want a Wasser engine in a pre-79 bus? &gt;&gt;

I was contemplating a intercooled turbodiesel conversion of my 79 westy.  I 
wanted to increase my horsepower and my fuel efficiency, and also increase my 
opportunities to burn alternative fuel.  With a diesel, I could burn biodiesel 
and straight waste vegetable oil.     

I researched the conversion and it looked like it would be a LOT of work.  
....at this point I decided to_instead_purchase an 82 diesel westy that already 
had the cooling system, engine mounts, heaters and exhaust taken care of.

I sort of wimped out.  I really like my bus, but I just wasn't up for all of 
the cutting, welding, fabricating, modifying, junkyard scavenging and trial 
and error that would have been required.

There is a T2 bus in the Seattle area powered by an Audi five cylinder engine 
and there are are web pages in German that document TDI installs.
