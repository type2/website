&lt;&lt; ON TWO ORDINARY BUMPER JACKS.

I was totally blown away that anyone would try this and get under a vehicle.
Especially someone I trusted to have more sense than to use bumper jacks as
the only support to hold up a car. &gt;&gt;

Best I've seen is the guy on a creeper being pulled from underneath a car
with an tranny on his chest...Purely intentional as the car was at the
curb; up on the bumper jacks, at full elevation to give him clearance... ;-(
