 Hi Folks,
        I have a 77 Westy 2.0 FI and my Haynes manual
 doesn't cover my 
 throttle vavle housing adjustment. The tvh doesn't
 have a swich or any other wires to 
 it.When I adjust the throttle cable (like the book
 said) the engine would run 
 wide open. So I made my own adjustment by having 
 the throttle vavle open a 
 crack and thghten the cable. Is this right?
 
-----------------------------------------------------

I am assuming you are trying to adjust idle speed? 
Look at the base of the housing for a round disc with
a slot in it, about the size of a dime. THAT is the
idle speed screw; in is lower, out is higher.

Throw away the Haynes and get a real manual!
