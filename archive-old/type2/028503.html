Hi John,

You are venturing into a potential Pandora's box...let's go get her  &gt;: ]

That strange little box is a starter booster relay.  It relays a
hotter/closer source of battery voltage to the solenoid upon using your key
to start up.  This is a necessary item and if it clicks when you turn the
key to the start position, it is *most likely* good.  Test it anyway.  *If*
the relay is bad, cheap or funky, this could be the only problem. Get out
your voltmeter and test the push on solenoid terminal for exact battery
voltage while cranking...i.e. if the battery tests 11.5V when you attempt a
key start, the solenoid should get the same with a functioning relay. True?
The relay is fine.  Not true?  You may have a bad relay or a failing
ignition switch.  If you want to replace it, consider the small Bosch 30A
relay...tiny and lasts forever if you mount it terminals *down* or seal with
silicone. I've seen plenty of new Bosch starters not work reliably without a
booster relay.

We need to know if you have a 6 or 12V starter and verify which bushing is
in there currently.  The voltage is stamped on the starter housing.  The
bushing will need to be inspected.

1. Let's assume your '66 has been converted over to 12V and has a 12V
flywheel (130 teeth for a 12V starter).  A professional conversion would
have included a 6 to 12V starter bushing for your 6V tranny and a 12V
starter. The 12V starter has a narrower shaft. If true, piece of cake, just
get a Bosch 12V starter. Part # SR 15X.

2. Important! You may have a 6V bushing.  If you have a 12V starter now,
check to see if there is/was a steel adapter sleeve on the old starter shaft
when you remove it. It might stay in the old 6V bushing and is likely chewed
up.  I strongly dislike this and recommend the correct 6-12V conversion
bushing be installed.  A good 12V starter will hang on this scenario after a
while.  Sometimes you'll find an auto-trans starter in there as it needs no
external bushing.  Costly starter tho.

3. If someone put in a 6V 200mm flywheel on your 71 engine, you have a 6V
starter you can claim higher starter RPM than us 12V starter guys until you
burn it out ;-)  Go back and do step 1.

Howdy Y'all,
I am posting this to both lists because I have a '66 bus with a '71 engine.
My starter\solenoid is letting me down more and more often. When I had to
crawl under there and whack the solenoid wearing a shirt and tie the other
day, I realized it was probably time to put in a new starter\solenoid.  My
question: As stated it's a '66 bus with a 1600 DP engine from a '71.
Which starter should I get? I believe it still has the original 6 volt
starter because there is a strange little box\transformer thingy wired in
line just before the starter (I'm guessing a voltage drop??) Should I get a
12 volt starter for a '71 or get a new '66 starter and keep the voltage drop
thingy there.  If my best bet is to get the '71 starter, could someone give
me a quick description of how this should be wired??
