Subject: Re: [T2] timming ?'s

&gt; well, i figured that since my 73 hadn't had the points
 replaced since new i'd give her a petronix upgrade.
 she doesn't seem to like it too much though and is
 coughing and spitting all over the place and when i
 rev her up she misses and coughs and spits.  you'd
 think she was protesting technology or something.  i
 tried to time her but can't get it set to 5 degrees
 atdc but she idles at about 10 degrees btdc.

Your 73 should have a dual vacuum unit distributor, correct?

The key to setting the timing at 5 after is 1) it has to be at idle and 2) you HAVE to have vacuum at idle on
the retard side of the vacuum unit, connected AND working.

Do you have vacuum at idle on the retard [inner] nipple?
If yes, when you disconnnect the line, does the idle speed up?

If you answered NO to either of these questions, you CANNOT set it at 5 after and expect it to run correctly.
