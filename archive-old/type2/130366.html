Hm.  I have actually used that cabinet on trips ... but your suggestion 
gets me to thinking...

&gt; I used a pair of 4x9&quot; speakers installed into the cover that hides the 
&gt; hatch springs. They sound great, and you can always hear them 
&gt; regardless of how heavily loaded the westy gets. 4x9's may be a bit 
&gt; harder to find, but they are also a lot easier to find places to 
&gt; install into. IIRC mine are made by pioneer, and originally came out 
&gt; of an early 80's buick.

4x10&quot; are not so hard to get... Sony makes a decent one, XS-W4121.

I wonder how difficult to build a small wedge that could hang down from 
the overhead cabinet to hold these... 4&quot; is not very tall...

Alternatively, a 4&quot; wide wedge for the speakers to be mounted 
vertically in the rear corners of the Bus might not be a bad idea, 
either...
