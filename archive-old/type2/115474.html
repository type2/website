Subject: Re: [T2] cold start injector

Sorry,

but that is not true phil.  The duration of the cold start valve pulse is
determined by the temperature that the thermoswitch feels.............this
is all controlled inside the ECU not by holding a key in the start position.

I am not guessing here.  I have the official dealer FI books for several
different models of vw's........diagnosed dozens of vans with FI
problems.......99 out of 100 not the cold start valve.
