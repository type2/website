Subject: Re: [T2] How to find out about bus gatherings?

Hi Tom,

This page would make for a good start:

http://www.fullmoonbusclub_dot_com/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=mycalendar

Get out to an event, then meet some people and get involved, it's a 
blast!


Happy trails,

&gt; know
&gt; about these gatherings and such?  I am in Central Jersey, and I never
