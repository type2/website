Subject: &quot;Greasing the battery&quot; - corrosion control procedure

If you want to take a real &quot;belt and suspenders&quot; approach to this matter, try 
the following procedure:

Start with a meticulously clean battery, battery posts, and cable terminals.

Using a terminal brush ream the cable terminals to bright, clean, metal from 
top to bottom.

Using a terminal brush clean the battery posts to bright, clean metal from top 
to bottom.

Install the cable terminals on the battery posts.  Make sure the cable 
terminals are down firmly on the battery posts with the top of the cable 
terminals either flush with, or below the top of, the battery posts.  This 
assures the maximum surface contact area between the inside of the cable 
terminals and the battery posts.

Spray the terminal assemblies LIBERALLY with WD-40.  Spray the entire top and 
sides of the battery case with WD-40.  Coating the clean battery case helps 
keep it clean and acts as a preservative on the case material.  It also deters 
corrosion.

Allow the WD-40 to air dry.

Coat the terminal assemblies liberally with petroleum jelly, as George 
suggested.

This is a nearly bullet-proof corrosion control procedure.  It's reliable, 
durable, and holds up well in the temperature conditions found in an 
air-cooled VW engine room.  An annual or seasonal redo is a good idea, but if 
not disturbed terminal assemblies treated/prepared this way will remain 
corrosion free indefinitely.
