&gt;&gt;   better. If before the cooler, then I would assume lower temperature
&gt;&gt;   means
&gt;&gt;   it doesn't transfer heat as well. My sender measures oil temp in the
&gt;&gt;   sump,
&gt;&gt;   which is more or less before the cooler, so I'm still going with
&gt;&gt;   &quot;doesn't
&gt;&gt;   transfer heat as well&quot;. Of course, I'm not very confident in my
&gt;&gt;   determination, and I'd love to be proven wrong. :-)
&gt;
&gt;For once, I disagree with you, David. This is my intuition:  An oil that
&gt;transfers more heat also &quot;pumps&quot; more heat out of the engine, hence leaves
&gt;the engine cooler overall. If the engine is cooler, so is the oil in the
&gt;sump. Hence the seeming paradox that an oil that absorbs more heat should
&gt;in fact be cooler. I think I'll give this Kendall stuff a try.

Okay, that sounds reasonable.  I'm going to go look for Kendall oil as
well, but I don't think I've *ever* seen that stuff for sale.  Maybe I'm
just not looking in the right places.
