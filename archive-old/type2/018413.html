My question also!  

I wish I could get my '71 insured for between 3 and 5 thousand dollars;
just to cover getting a van in like mechanical condition if someone
crunches it.  We have liability, but nothing other than that. Our
insurance agent sez that it is not possible;  You either get comp-- you
can guess how much they would pay on an ugly-but-mechanically-great '71 
daily driver bus(namely as little as possible)--or you insure cuz it's a
show car, and then you can't drive it . . .

Is it possible to insure an auto of our's age for a fixed amount of
money?  If so, who does so?
