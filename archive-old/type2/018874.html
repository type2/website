&gt; You're dead-on with 3 weeks being insufficient time.  I don't know if 6
&gt; months is too much or not, but I'd want that amount of time to drive
&gt; the bus locally before venturing off on the Great Adventure.

I would agree 100%. Even if you ran across a NOS '78 engine and some ace
mechanic to install it gratis, you'd still want:
- decent trustworthy tires ($$$)
- a port-a-potty
- an aux battery and lights and fans installed
- an oil temp gauge, oil press gauge...
and some experience doing basic tune up stuff so you can fix it when it
breaks. 
tools, spares, et cetera. It runs into some money, and it's tough to
afford it all at once, or even to know what to acquire all at once.
