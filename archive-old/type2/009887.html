Hello list,

	Since I'm about to attempt an engine rebuild, I looked up my
Chassis number and Engine number, for obvious reasons.  But, I can't seem
to make sense of them.

	I have a 1974 VW Bus, and I thought it was type 2 ... but now I'm
not so sure.  Seems I keep reading that it is a type 2 bus with a type 4
style engine.  At any rate, here is the info.  Maybe there is someone out
there that can clear this up for me.

	1974 VW Bus, 1800 cc, manual, carberated engine
	Chassis Number: 224-2074-423
	Engine Number: AW010226

	Any and all help would be appreciated.  The road to understanding
seems to be a slow and difficult one for me.

	Thanks,

		Wade

	P.S.  Are there other VW Bus owners in the Chicagoland area?  If
so, I'm in Elmhurst and would love to meet some of you that have the
knowledge and expertise I am looking for. :)
