Subject: Re: [T2] Question for the electrical experts


OK Al,
Here goes.


+12V ---[fuse]---.------------o
                 |            -----o-----[fan]---[ground]
                 |--/\/\/\----o
                   10 ohms   switch

If the ascii schematic above is messed up, highlight it and put it into fixed
width.

In describing the circuit above,
from +12v to the fuse
from the fuse to a junction of two wires.
One wire goes to high speed terminal on the switch
the other wire goes to a terminal on the resistor
from the other terminal on the resistor, a wire will go to
the low speed terminal on the switch.
From the common terminal of the switch, a wire will go to the fan, red
the fan, black will connect to ground.

Normally the switch is used in reverse of how it's connected here.
Power to the center terminal then the switched leads go the the windshield wiper
motor.

I calculated a resistance of 8 to 10 ohms and 25 watts should work to cut the
current to the fan in half.

I found a resistor at digikey that is an adjustable power resistor and you can
connect one wire to the adjustable terminal and move the adjustment until low
speed is comfortable.

I think the resistor is about $7.00

If you
Note on adjusting the resistor,
it is set in place by tightening a setscrew.
loosen the screw to move, tighten, turn the fan on and test the speed.
repeat the above process until you are happy with the low speed.
trying to move it with the screw tight will wreck the resistor
trying to test it with the screw loose will risk flaky results and can burn that
point on the resistor.

Hope this helps,
Scott
