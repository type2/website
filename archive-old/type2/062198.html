Detonation sounds like a likely cause...but just what IS detonation...?   Is it
just a premature combustion which can't be turned into positive crankshaft
rotation???  Why does a lean mixture cause this???    There was no water damage
to this engine....still in the vehicle and otherwise in good shape.  John Jensen
