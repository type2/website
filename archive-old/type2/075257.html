Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Utility

&gt;Hell as long as we're discussing utility, I recently loaded my bus up 
&gt;with 2,300 lbs (yes, really!) of ceramic tile, thinset, and mortar.  
&gt;Yes, I know I was a little over the GVWR but the bus handled it just fine

Well, I can't top that one.  But David's right.  These old buses can really 
take on a load and still be safe.  I went with a friend to pick up a bunch of 
those big landscaping bricks this summer.  We put 40 of them (~1000 lbs) in her 
Mazda Tribute SUV and 60 of them (~1500 lbs) plus 300 lbs of sand in my 73 
Westy.  Her Tribute looked really weighted down and she said it handled really 
weird.  My bus felt just fine.  I have no doubt my brakes would have noticed it 
if I'd had to stop fast, but otherwise no problems.

I use my 58 single cab to get firewood.  Last year I bought at a place that 
weighs you going in and coming out and charges by the pound.  Going in I was 
something like 2400 lbs and coming out I was somewhere around 3800.  Brakes 
felt sluggish, but the handling was just fine and the 1776 with the dual Webers 
pulled 55 mph up a VERY steep hill going home.  Gotta love these vehicles!
