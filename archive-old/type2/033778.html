Subject: Re: Driving in the wind

Gotta agree on this one.  We replaced the steering damper on my '71, not
much help.  Had appropriate tires on it, not much help.

Then we replaced the shocks---BIG difference.  Now we have no more
&quot;float like a boat&quot; with the front end casting about like a dog smelling
dinner!

&gt; 
&gt; A few questions -
&gt; 
&gt; What kind of tires do you run?  If they are passenger tires, that may be the
&gt; problem.  Look at the Tire FAQ on the type2_dot_com website for more info about
&gt; tires.
&gt; 
&gt; How old are the shocks (front and rear)?  Old shocks will allow your bus to
&gt; track from side to side whilst being tossed around in the wind.
&gt; 
&gt; Do you have a front stabilizer bar?  It's this big bar that run underneath
&gt; the front beam and down the trailing arms with two clamps on each end (on
&gt; the arms, not the beam).  If you are missing that or it is an old stock
&gt; unit, you will get tossed around as well.
&gt; 
&gt; Check out the front and rear of the bus and let us know what you find!
