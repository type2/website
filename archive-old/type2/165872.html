Subject: death valley

since my beloved Goethe and i are quickly approaching 30, i thought
that it might be fun to celebrate by driving through Death Valley
National Park.  since i am in stl, mo it would be a rather long drive
any way i went.  probably would not do this for another year or two,
but thought i'd see if any one had any suggestions on a good time of
year to do this, supplies, preperations, etc., etc., etc.

thanks,

jeremiah

p.s. Goethe is a 77 kombi w/ a auto trans. and a 75 FI engine(1.8
heads w/ carb intake valves and possibly a larger than stock cam)
