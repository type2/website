&gt; Has anyone heard of a mod. to the engine where an extra spark plug is added to
&gt; each cylinder? I remember reading about this &quot;twin plugging&quot; of motorcycle
&gt; engines especially big twins such as BMW's and Moto Guzzi's years ago. The
&gt; benefits are supposedly increased efficiency in burning the gases with
&gt; improved power coupled with increased M.P.G.
&gt; 
&gt; Any thoughts?

Nitro-burning drag racing cars in the US use this kind of setup. It tends to
shorten engine life quite a bit. Or is it the 50 gallons per mile fuel
economy you get out of one of those cars that's responsible?

The reason they use dual plugs in those engines is to get the nearly-
unignitable nitromethane (you can throw a lit match into nitromethane and
watch the match fizzle out) they burn in those cars to light. On a VW engine
I'd just put an MSD ignition box on there and be done with it.
