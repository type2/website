Subject: Just got back with lots of free goodies!!

&gt;I now have 4 sets of old Solex PDSIT-3 dual carbs

Congrats on a great score!

I'm currently having trouble with a T4 with OE Solex duals that has been 
sitting for years. Just finished putting everything together and took for 
the first drive today. Carbs seem real balky. Any suggestions besides 
tearing them down for complete cleaning? I added fuel system cleaner today 
hoping to get away with the easy way...
