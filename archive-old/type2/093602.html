disembarking though.

&gt; I don't disagree with you at all. I listened to the sweet cacaphony of 
&gt; my 1641 for most of 6,000 miles this spring - and prefered it to the 
&gt; steady-state thump of my brain, which is one-cylinder. But where else 
&gt; can I get my Britney fix if I don't have a stereo (mono at least).
