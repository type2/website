&gt; You sure as hell do not.  This is exceedingly
&gt; poor advice unless you have a show car or vehicle
&gt; that is heavily modified and worth more than the
&gt; average bus.  Most of us do not.  Don't waste
&gt; your money.  

&quot;the rest of the story&quot;  concerning my bus, anyone who has seen the bus or
photos know that it is a rare &quot;HPBus&quot; conversion,  The insurance company
determined that conversion adds about 5k to the value of my bus, and thus
the reason for the assigned value policy.

&gt; The insurance company will not offer you what you
&gt; want the first time, assigned value or not,

but of course, as they say it is only an &quot;offer&quot; you do not have to take
it.

&gt; especially if you use the el cheapo companies. 

always use a quality company with a history you can check

&gt; YMWV.  Not intended to be legal advice.  Consult
&gt; an attorney in your state.  Etc. etc.  

as always
