All,

Regarding all your requests for the .JPG files:

You can now view and/or download the three .JPG images from H Steven 
Dolan's page:

http://www2.ari_dot_net/dworkin/vw/

He's made it real easy to download this stuff without unencoding or 
any of that.  He's also made smaller versions of each for faster 
viewing.  If you want to print a poster, a sticker or tattoo one on 
your forehead, I suggest downloading the larger images and reducing 
them in size (but *not* in resolution, i.e., 300 dpi).

Have fun,

Roy
