Hello,

Try downshifting into 1st (clutch in) and then over into reverse
and see if it goes smoothly.  What maybe happening is that
there is a bit of wear on both the reverse idler gear (the one
that you move when you shift into reverse) and also on the
engagement teeth for reverse on the 1st/2nd gear slider.  By
slightly letting out on the clutch you allow the teeth to overcome
this wear and slide into each other.
