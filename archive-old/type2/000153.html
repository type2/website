In a message dated 99-10-05 08:31:40 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; . They had to do it 4 times
 with two different windshields before they got it leak free. The final
 time one guy spent almost 4 hours working on it. &gt;&gt;

I've been reading all this on windshield installs, and quite frankly I'm 
surprised. My wife (5'2&quot;, about 105 lbs.) and I installed the windshield in 
my '76 in about 45 minutes. Very easy. I was more worried about dropping it 
than anything else. She was on the inside pulling the cord while I was 
applying pressure from the outside. She did have a little trouble pulling the 
cord toward the end, as the seal became tighter. And it does'nt leak. As for 
Safelite, I'm not surprised. Last time they put a windshield in for me ( '88 
GMC van) it leaked badly, and they never did get it right. Once they missed 
an appointment with me because 2 installers did'nt show for work, and a 3rd 
was in jail. Class operation. Also, beware, some shops won't warranty work if 
they use parts you supply. I can see it now: &quot;Sorry your windshield 
leaks-must be the seal that YOU provided&quot;        Jeff S.

BTW- this was the Safelite shop in Springfield Va.
