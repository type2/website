I'm replacing the sagging headliner on my '78 bus.  I only need to
replace the vinyl in the cab.  I've called a bunch of placed looking for
the headliner panel and I just learned that it is not a panel at all.
The vinyl is just glued on.  Anyone know if this this true?  If it is
than I guess what that means is that all I need to get is about 2 yards
of vinyl and some adhesive.  Is there a certain type of vinal that I
need to get?
Thanks
