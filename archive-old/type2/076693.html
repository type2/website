Subject: Re: [T2] RE:black crud coming off my 1970's steering wheel

What you want is PC7 available in hardware stores. Says right in the can that
it is for repair of steering wheels. It is a 2 part epoxy type paste. Drys
rock hard in 24 hours. Seems to be ever so slightly softer than the bakelight
plastic of the steering wheel. Makes it ideal for sanding to shape without
taking off the existing plastic as long as you use fine wet sandpaper. The
special paint someone is refering too was once called enamel. Don't Think
you'll find good enamel any more due to EPA regs. I use epoxy or lots of coats
of regular rattle can stuff by Krylon in the desired color followed by several
clear coats. Works great! Get ready for some tedious sanding though, Havn't
found anything that works better than hand sanding.

Hope this helps,
Tom

&gt; Along these lines, anybody know of a site/formula for &quot;bakelite&quot; -
&gt; but not black...to repair a steering wheel?
