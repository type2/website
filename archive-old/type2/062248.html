 Hiya bus owners!
 
 For some strange reason I've decided that a VW Camper (Westy?) is
 something that I would just love to have.  I was wondering if you folks
 could could point me in the direction of some good information (either
 electronic or paper) for a potential owner.
 
 I've been lurking here and on the vanagon list for a while and have just
 about decided that I can't live without one.  I've particularly enjoyed
 the Inuvik stories.  Also, if anyone knows of any organizations local to
 me here in Dallas that I could get in contact with, I would appreciate
 the information.
 
 I'm primarily interested in the early air cooled models for their
 simplicity as I would be doing most of the work on it myself (former
 auto mechanic am I).
 
 I appreciate any advice or recommendations you can offer!
 
 Thanks!

Try the Metroplex Micros. They are a club of type 2 owners in the Dallas
area. 
I think Vee-Dub Folks in Irving has their phone #.
