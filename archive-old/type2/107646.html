Subject: Solid '79 FS in New Hampshire

Hi Volks,

I have a solid '79 for sale in Newmarket, NH.  This is the bus that Daniel
McGuire posted about a couple weeks back when he was desperately looking for
help in the Boston area.  We got him back home to Utah and the bus is
staying with me until it sells.

I have not driven this bus personally, but Daniel drove it up to my house
from Boston, so I know it is in driveable condition.  The 2.0L FI engine
starts and runs well.  The only mechanical problem that I know of is that
the tranny is hard to get into 4th, and sometimes pops out.  It could just
be a linkage problem, or it might be more involved.

It needs an engine hatch and a little bit of body work on the rear apron,
but outside of that it is solid and ready to go.  I definitely think this
bus is a steal at $850.00.  I would have bought it myself, but my girlfriend
would probably have me commited...  You can check out some pics on
