Subject: Steven safe in Union, OR

Steve Dolan made his appearance in Union, OR this evening.  Currently
camped in my driveway in his (obligatory bus content) bus.  He is
planning to continue to Seattle in the AM.  If you all have any messages
to be passed on to him, now's the time to do it. Just send them to me
and I'll see that the word gets passed on.
