&gt; I really can't find this answer in the archive which somehow authaurize
&gt; myself to post my question to the list.
&gt; From which sit,  the driver is supposed to drive , left  or  right side
&gt; ? , I rules out the back sit since it won't be practical to watch the
&gt; road and I would be very tempted to make coffee while driving. Ho ! I
&gt; almost forget ! I have a California vanagon 83 model.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for any help
&gt;

    Not to be caustic, but if you're having this kind of problem
with decision making, shouldn't you be posting to the vintage
