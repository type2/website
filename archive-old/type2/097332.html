Subject: Re: [T2] Using  2000 FI stuff in a 1975 1800cc engine

While I respect your experience with going with stock, Dr Tim, I want to
give my daughter a bus with an engine that is reliable and yet not time
consuming or costly as she won't do her own work and may not be near me at
college.  Based on Karl's recc, Jon put in hydraulic German lifters with the
old cam that looked fine and (Karl says)  is the same as the bus cam used in
hydraulic engines.  Regarding using later FI stuff, I understand that even
VW realized they goofed with the external throttle switch/temp sender under
the airbox and changed it after 6 months to what I think was a switch above
the airbox and an AFM with an air temp sender; then moved the throttle
switch into the AFM?  Jon thinks that it will be difficult to find
replacement parts for such &quot;half yr only&quot; stuff, and the 75 stock sender has
given problems in the past.  This was the reason for considering going to a
later harness, airbox, AFM, and ECU.   I'll happily leave it stock  if the
list can convince me that the 75 system is fault free, and the airbox w/
sender/switch , AFM, and ECU is easy to find for a 75.   BTW, it's in a heck
of a spot to get at.  The message I hear is that I should use a later 2000
cc engine...which I'd agree with, but the original engine was fine in the
bottom end.
