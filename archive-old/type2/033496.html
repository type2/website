For years, I've known about the Nokia Tires (now known as Nokian) from
Finland and their reputation for superior Ice and Snow performance.  I
have used and loved the Goodyear F32 &quot;Studdless&quot; snow tires for 3 years
and was ready to make my decision for new winter tires.

My Problem (same for most Vanagon/Bus 14&quot; wheel owners) is getting heavy

duty 14&quot; tires with the load carrying rating required by Vanagons and
Busses in the new special studdless rubber compounds.  Almost all of the

best 14&quot; versions are light weight passenger tires or are meant for ice
but not deep snow..   I needed both ice and deep snow abilities.

I made one last check to see if Nokia tires were anywhere around and
found out that Les Schwab Tires is now a dealer for Nokia!!!   ~AND~
Nokia has just released an 8 ply rated Hakkapeliitta 10 LT Snow tire in
the size of 185 SR14.   At least that's what the sales guy called it..
I wanted larger diameter tires, but he said these were a special size
that was almost as large as my BFGoodrich 8.50x27  TA All terrain
Radials..    Not sure if he was lying or not, but they are large enough
to satisfy me.

The tire claims to be a 185 R75 14 C with a max load of 1875 lbs at 65
pounds of air cold.   I added the optional studding (though these are
really studdless class tires) with the usual balance/stem charges and
tax came to $434.53.  Base price was $89.65 with studs.  $10 less
without.

I have already tested them in snow that I would not consider entering
with the other winter tires and was totally amazed!!   These tires have
all of the best qualities in one:  Heavy load capacity in a 14&quot; tire,
Aggressive snow tread with special rubber compound for ice, tall, narrow

and studdable.

I looked for 15&quot; wheels to allow a better selection of tires, but each
time I checked on ~REAL~ VW 15&quot; wheels (from South Africa or where
ever),  5 wheels was going to cost as much as $700 by the time I added
the right studs, covers and shipping..  And on top of that, no one had
them in stock nor could they tell me when they would be available.

I am totally satisfied with these tires and would recommend them to any
Bus/Vanagon owner.   One curious note:  I was getting used to the fact
that the tires were called Nokian instead of Nokia and was getting used
to the fact that I might have been mistaken from the start on the name,
but MY tires say &quot;NOKIA&quot; in big plain letters..  There is no mistake.
But don't try to pronounce &quot;Hakkapeliitta&quot; in mixed company.  Yes,
that's how it's spelled..  I'm looking at the word right now.

I figure if they save me a tow bill or body damage from a slide and
maybe even prevent the need for a winter search and rescue, these tires
are cheap insurance.   Just watch out for the guy behind you that can't
stop as fast as you.

Happy Winter Bus Driving!!
