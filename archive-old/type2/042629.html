Subject: '78 Westy purchase??

Just got a call from a very excited cousin who is looking into purchasing
her first vehicle-a '78 Westy.  I got the call 'cuz I have a Vanagon, but I
don't know anything about these beasts.  This is all she knows: '78 with 30k
on a new engine.  price is $3750.  What are some things to look out for??
Is this a fair price??   Is a '78 a &quot;good year&quot; for busses.  I am taking a
ride to look at it with her on Thurs.  Any insight would be appreciated...

THANKS!!!

-Mike
