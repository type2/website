Subject: Re: [T2] Living out of a Bus on the road with Kids 

Dan,

I have some very good friends that did the exact samething.

Works well, but they asked for a specific location just 12 miles from 
where they used to live(for the time being).

&quot;Going mobile!&quot;...&quot;watch the tax man miss me&quot;....or whatever the words to 
the song were...LOL!

Cheers, dave

 One of my tenants tells me that his mom&amp;dad
 bought not a bus but a motor home and then
 volunteered for a (US) National Park Service
 program wherein if they man concessions stands,
 sweep this or that, or otherwise do odd jobs
 at parks selected for them by NPS then they 
 can live in their motor home at said parks
 free of charge.  This couple sold their house
 to buy the motor home and put some cash in the
 bank, and have thus been living out of that
&gt; vehicle for about a decade, all in national
&gt; parks.  Apparently assignments are seasonal
&gt; and not necessarily close to each other, but
&gt; that pleases them and their new-found vagabond
&gt; tendencies.  (&quot;We booked for two months at
&gt; The Black Hills and have a week to get there,
&gt; great!&quot;)  Program is aimed at retirees, as
&gt; one might guess.
