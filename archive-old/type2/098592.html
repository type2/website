Subject: Transmission output shaft bearings loose... Help

Hi all,
Ok here goes, My CV boot on one side ripped, I patched
it with innertube material afer packing it with tons
of greas and set out on my latest mini road trip from
Kentucky to South Carolina. In North Carolina I
stopped to check the wannabe CV boot and noticed that
not only was my repair broken, it was still holding in
some grease but definatly not a longterm solution.
Worse was my next discovery that inboard of the CV
where the axel enters the transmission case, (sorry
for the lack of technical terms) the bearing there
appears to be loos and is moving up and down _at_ 1/8 of
an inch. First of all I'm assuming this is not normal.
Secondly what do I have to do to solve the problem? I
know that I'm going to have to replace my CVs but what
do I do about that bearing? The tranny is not leaking
any fluid (unless its all gone) and the transmission
still works fine and is quiet. Lastly does anyone have
a good source for a new (read old but usable)
transmission south of the mason dixon and preferably
in South Carolina. 
Thanks for any and all help,
Giles
