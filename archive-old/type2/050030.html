Subject: [T2] Dual Weber carbs question

I am installing a pair of Weber 34 ICT carbs in replace of the stock 28
PDSIT carbs on my bus's Type 3 engine (yes, type 3). These carbs are new
to
me...Are they supposed to have an idle cut off valve? I didn't get any
with them and It looks like there
is a place to screw on in on the side of each carb, but the solex ones
wont fit. If not what is this hole for? 

Thanks,
Eddie
