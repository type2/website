&gt; What's weird is the blades on my 2 year old Kia Spectra EX are still like
&gt; brand new.  Go figure.:-P

As are the blades on our Toyota Scion xB.  2+ years, no streaks!  Much
better than the common replacement blades.  Went to
the Toyota dealer to get replacments.  The blades he tried to sell me
are Anco.  :(
