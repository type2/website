Subject: Another style trailer hitch from a '76 Safare

Sunday I pulled my rear bumper off my '76 hightop to have it powdercoated,
and this trailer hitch was part of the dismount.

It does not touch the rear bumper, and it seems to be a version like Jamie
Rivers'.

it was made by someone in South Carolina, per one of the stickers on the
cross beam.

BTW, I have a 'five piece' trailer hitch that is extra to me.  I took a bit
of time to clean it up and get neex fasteners, and it looks really fine.  It
is heave, but comes apart in pieces for storage and shipping.....
