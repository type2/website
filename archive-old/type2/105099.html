&gt; hey foks, I bought a new bentley about a year ago (official service manual 
&gt; for 68-79 bus).... I have since purchased a 79 westy with automatic 
&gt; transmission.  The Bentley section on the auto tranny says it only covers 
&gt; the auto tranny up to '76 and that there is not enough technical data for 
&gt; the later transmission.
&gt; 
&gt; Do new bentleys have a section that covers the later transmission?  If not, 
&gt; is there another source for service and technical info for a 79 auto 

no the later Bentleys do not have any more info and say the same
the VW repair manual second edition, with the orange cover does have
information on the 010 (post 1975) auto tranny
