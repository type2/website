&gt; I hope to get my 79 GE engine in and running this weekend but am
&gt; confused about Bentley's description of my pushrods.  It says on a 78
&gt; and 79 they should be solid steel, not tubular.  Mine feel pretty heavy
&gt; but are tubular in that they have a tiny hollow from one end to the
&gt; other.  I assume this is for oil to travel to the rocker arms.  Do I
&gt; have the wrong pushrods on this engine?

The older push rods were solid Aluminum. In 78 they changed to 1-piece Steel
rods with the center lubrication passage.

I think you found an error in the Bentley. On Engine And Clutch p31 it
probably should say:

17. Pushrod - solid through 1977, tubular steel from 1978 (8)

You have the right ones; they feel heavy.
