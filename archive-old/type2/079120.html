Subject: torque wrench

I think it's probably a good thing to get my torque wrench recalibrated
before putting my engine back together.  It's a craftsman wrench and
it's at least 5 years old so it's probably a little bit out of
adjustment.

Where do I go to get this done?  Does Sears do this or are there special
shops that'll do it?

Thanks!
Mike
