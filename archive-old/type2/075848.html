Subject: FI lovers question

Folks,

78 Champagne edition...  2.0l with fi

You convinced me that fi was good(don't go carbs).

I learned it...no problem.  It works well, I can reach in and turn the key
and it fires right up.

Now it's time to start replacing some parts, mostly I figure I have a
slight vacum leak in the large rubber tube that goes from the afm to the
plenum.

I just tried to order one(from bus-boys) and was told that it is(dreaded
words) NLA.

What now?  Do I grovel at the Mack truck shop looking for the large sizes
of preformed intake and radiator hose tubes and roll my own, or does
anyone have a good source for &quot;new&quot;.

Looking for tubing, dave&lt;grin&gt;
