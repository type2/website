Subject: Compression test &amp; valve adjustment 2

Hey All,

The bus had been sitting cold since last night.  I pulled the valve
covers,
rotated the crank &amp; matched the rotor to Cyl 1 tdc.
I loosened the set screw &amp; nut to adjust the valve, screwed it in till
the screw
contacted the valve stem.  Then I turned it 2.5 more turns. Did both
intake &amp;
exhaust for #1.  Then rotated crank cc 180 deg, rotor cc 90 deg. and did
cyl 2.
etc for 3 &amp; 4

Put covers back on and started engine.  there was still the hard
tap/clack sound
that I've been hearing.

Let it idle in the driveway for ~10 mins.  I occasionally revved the
engine.
turned off the motor
Pulled the plugs, disconnected the ignition &amp; FI

Tues- Checked the compression: (after valve adjustment &amp; 10min idle)
Cyl 1- 95
2 - 90
3 - 35
4 - 120

On Mon compression was (after driving around for ~ 10 minutes:)
Cyl 1- 55
2- 90
3 - 60
4 - 120

so, there was a difference in cyl 1 &amp; 3. possibly due to adjustment and
different warm up procedures.

Then I squirted oil into each cylinder
compression:
Cyl 1 - 100
2 - 95
3  - 110
4 - 120

so:
Cyl    Original comp    Adj. valves      squirt oil
1         55                    95                  100
2         90                    90                   95
3         60                    35                  110
4        120                  120                 120

I thought it was valve noise, but I don't know.  Looks like the rings on
# 3 may be shot.
any thoughts?

thanks
