Subject: Another shoddy part tale.....

There's been a fair number of posts over the past year or so about the
declining quality of available Type 2 parts.  Here's another one.

My daughter's boyfriend drives a 1959 double door (as in double doors on
both sides) panel that his folks bought a few months back.  The PO had
done, or had had done, quite a bit of work on the engine and power train.
 It has a dual relief case 1600 SP engine, and apparently when the engine
work was done a new clutch was installed.

The other day the van refused to go into gear at the usual awkward time
and location (insert your personal worst case scenario here), and it
seemed clear the clutch cable had stretched severely or broken.  The
disabled van was retrieved and the clutch cable found to be intact, so
after an adjustment a test drive was attempted.  Got one block and
refused (again) to go into gear.

Back in the shop the engine was pulled and the clutch disc facing fell to
the floor in itty-bitty pieces.  The pressure plate side lining was
intact, in fact looked almost new, but the flywheel side lining was
completely disintegrated.  A careful inspection revealed the disk was
marked &quot;MADE IN KOREA&quot;.

The pressure plate is an F&amp;S unit that bears the VW stamp, and looked to
be in perfect condition, so it was retained.

The dysfunctional Korean clutch disk was replaced with a German part.

We've seen and/or heard of motor mounts and BOSCH spark plugs from India,
and a variety of other bits manufactured in surprising and exotic
locales, but this exploding Korean clutch disk is a new item for the
lengthening list of junk aftermarket components.  

Buyer beware.....
