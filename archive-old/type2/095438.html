Subject: Drag Day Bay Window

Simon &amp; List -

You guys &amp; gals can hold your heads up high. It was indeed a Type2 
listmember that showed the high-zoot snot-rockets a thing-a-ma-jig or two.

C'mon - 11.70's? Naaaa. Itch ran a best of 14.18+ and speeds in the &quot;high 
46's&quot; all day. It took 6 races to put the boys and girls in their place.

The final run?

My dial-in: 14.33
His dial-in: 8.00

My run: 14.319 (a .011 break out)
His run: 7.95 (a .05 break out)

I sin less. I win. Y'all can pick your jaws up off the floor now.

Simon - Thanks for being there and cheering us on! It was my first drag, and 
really REALLY got a boost out of everybody that gave us the thumbs-up.

I have an idea - why don't we all enter next drag? Maybe a 1-2 bus sweep?

Simon sez....

The coolest thing today was seeing a 'full-dress' (awning on the side and
everything) bay window Westy clickking off 11.70's in the 1/8th mile strip,
and beating all comers, i.e. 9-second turbo sedans, 48 IDA'd monsters,
stripped down sedans.  Way to go!!!  Gotta love bracket racing.

Possibly a listee, maybe?  I was the one in the Savannah Beige bus near the
big end cheering you on for every round!

Later,

Simon
