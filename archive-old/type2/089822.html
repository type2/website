Hello All     to remove the bushing with motor in take a tap that just cuts 
treads and run in and keep tapping till the bushing pushes out, to install 
take a scocket that just fits the outter edge of the bushing and tape them 
together, using a long extention tap it in to the hole, the tape will slide 
off as the bushing goes in. Later and have fun  Mark Dearing salem import
