Subject: Antique License Plate???

Hey guys,

	Anyone live here in Florida have an &quot;Antique&quot; license plate on their
car? I'm not sure exactly what the benefit is (if any) but my 1973 VW Bus
now qualifies for a &quot;Regular&quot; Antique license plate because it is now 30
years or older. 

Pre 1945 vehicles get registered as Horseless carriages. 

I was thinking about getting one. Just wondering if anyone had ever done
that before on here.


Thanks,
