If you packed the hub, then the heat build up from the bearings is expanding
the grease and forceing it out.  The only grease that should be in there is
the grease that is packed into the bearings, all other grease is useless and
a waste of money.

In some applications too much grease can create so much pressure it can ruin
the bearing.  As for the front wheels, it just gets pushed past the seals
and dust cap.  I hope you used high temperature grease made for disk brakes.

&gt; I recently replaced the front wheel bearings and grease seals on my '79
&gt; westy and packed the hubs with a high temperature wheel bearing grease from
&gt; my local FLAPS.  This grease seems to flow out from under the hubcaps when
&gt; I drive and makes a mess underneath the hubcaps and eventually on the rims
&gt; outside of the hubcaps.  What's up with that?
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know of a good wheel bearing grease that resists flow due to
&gt; the combined effects of heat and centrifugal force?
