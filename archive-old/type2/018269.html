Subject: FYI Firewall reinstall
Message-ID: &lt;3752A29D.DF4779B3_at_west_dot_net&gt;

Just a mention for anyone else who may be removing/reinstalling a
firewall on a pancake engine (1800cc)--the last few inches are the
hardest. I couldn't figure out how to get the bottom of the firewall to
clear the front engine tin, but I recalled a msg in the archives from
someone who said they used every putty knife they owned.

I went to KM*RT five minutes before closing and bought three wide-blade
taping knives. With the firewall in place, I wedged the blades between
the tin and the vehicle frame, the firewall resting on handles of the
knives. A gentle shove and the firewall popped right in place.
