&lt;If you're into econo-retro, what you want is a Robin Reliant...25% cheaper to
put new tires on... ;-)&gt;

It just cost me $28.50 to fill up my '97 VW Cabrio today.... Those micro-mini cars are looking appealing next to my gas guzzling (35 mpg) Cabrio... &lt;grin!&gt;

I've seen a Robin Reliant on the road in Italy and at the Lane Motor Museum in Nashville (http://www.lanemotormuseum_dot_org/). No, I want a REAL car like the Fiat 500... &lt;griN!&gt; 

The $2.50/gallon gas is still better than the time it took $50 to fill up my '84 Rabbit 'vert in Rome in 1994... About $4.75 back then. $6+ now. Beware the free universal/socialized medicine programs. It is HUGE taxes on gasoline that pay for it in Italy. Nice idea, expensive to operate.

'78 Westy 2,7L - a full sized motorhome next to a Fiat 500 - the perfect car to tow along...
