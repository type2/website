Subject: RE: RE: Fuel injector cleaner

I think that's very similar to what happened to me. There were several things going wrong, including burned points, but the plugs were the worst. After I put the cleaner in there, the plugs went really black. I just finised a complete tune-up (points, condensor, timing, plugs, etc) and it runs like a dream. I took out on the highway right away to burn out some of that crud and I think that helped a lot. However, this morning it seemed to have a little trouble idling. I'd bet I have a few semi-clogged injectors again from the crud the cleaner produced. Did the VW dealer give you an option to clean the injectors (out of the car) or did you have the replace them?

Thanks for the input,

This reminds me of time I poured a can of STP fuel injector cleaner into the tank of my 1972 Squareback in 1983:  The cleaner worked great - in fact it dissolved so much crude, etc in the gas tank and lines that it clogged TWO injectors!  I remember being stuck during troubleshooting because I had a &quot;loping&quot; idle and I would pull off one spark plug wire from the distributor and nothing would happen!  I pulled off another (it just coincidentally happened to be both the plug wires that were connected to the two injectors that were clogged) and nothing changed!  I didn't proceed any further, just dropped the car off at the VW dealers.  Two hundred dollars (injectors = $65 ea plus labor) later I was back on the road.

Hope this helps
