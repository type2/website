Subject: tow bar

hi

i am new to the list and have a tow bar question.  i have looked over the
archives, but have not found what i am looking for.  specifically i want
to build my own tow bar specific to the bus from 71-79.  i don't have a
beetle tow bar nor do i wish to use one.  so if you have pictures of
something that fits the description, or plans and measurements i am very
interested.  also other general insight would be appreciated, but let it
be said that i want to use a tow bar not a dolly or a trailer.  if i get
good information i will be constructing a web page detailing the
information for the list to use.  hopefully this would act as a clearing
house for answers on this type of question.  thanks in advance for your time.
