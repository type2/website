Subject: Re: [T2] STOCK DUAL CARBS TO PORSCHE 1700 L-JET FI CONVERSION QUESTIONS???

&gt;&gt; The Porsche regulator on the eailier 914 was adjustable, 
a nice feature, but they stopped that when DIY'ers kept wanting 
to turn screws that they had no way of knowing how to set right. &gt;&gt;

&gt;Just curious...Is this something verifiable, or just conjecture? Or was it 

That's fact.  You loosen the lock-nut and turn the screw.  Porsche specifies 
28.5 psi as the correct setting.  I've got a permanently mounted inline 
pressure gauge in my 74 914 2.0 and I found that when I was in San Antonio, TX 
that 30.5 was OK - clean emisions, more power than when set at 28.5, good mpg, 
no bad side effects.  Since moving to Colorado Springs, I've backed it off to 
the recommended 28.5 to keep it from running too rich.

Tim's comment about DIY'ers is frighteningly true.  I don't know how many d-Jet 
manifold pressure sensors I've seen with the epoxy drilled or chipped out and 
the factory-adjusted screw jacked with.  Turns a perfectly good sensor into a 
paperweight - no way to correctly re-set the tension on the diaphram.  Funny 
thing is, &quot;tuning&quot; with that particular screw gives you absolutely no benefit.
