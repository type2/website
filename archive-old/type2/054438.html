&gt;&gt; 1) in the library, bartnik notes it is important to set the idle properly
&gt;&gt; before doing engine timing. muir has those steps reversed. which is
&gt;&gt; correct, please?
&gt; 
&gt; Well, in reality you set timing, then idle, then timing, then idle, and so
&gt; on until everything is right.  It therefore doesn't really matter which
&gt; parameter you set first.

It's spark plugs, valves, dwell angle before you even touch the timing, then
you do idle speed. Spark plugs because you gotta start somewhere, and the
other three all affect idle.
