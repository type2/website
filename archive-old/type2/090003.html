Subject: Re: [T2] Access Panel

just the thought of having an access panel in my 72 is making
my mouth water.

i've heard that the Vanagon access hatches are a bit bigger.
anyone ever transplanted one?

also, since i am not a welder, anyone near me (Raleigh, NC)
up to attempting this job on my ride? of course i would be
willing to compensate for time/parts/etc.

also, what is the email addy for the onduty T2 admin? i
can't seem to find it at the moment.

happy friday,
