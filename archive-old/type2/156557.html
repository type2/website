Subject: RE: [T2] CHT gauge testing

&gt; It was already mounted by the PO under the dash to
&gt; the left of the steering column. I would like to get
&gt; the 4 gauge setup you have, but it is $200 and I
&gt; don't have that right now. This gauge has never
&gt; worked, and I just now got a chance to look at it.
&gt; Next time I change the plugs, I will test the sensor
&gt; to see what I get. Looks like I will probably just
&gt; have no gauge until I can afford a 4 gauge cluster
&gt; and senders...
I'll have to price an EGT gauge. Most people who buy
CHT gauges really need a EGT so they can see all 4
cyls on one gauge. The individual gauge-per-cylinder
is still preferred as it does 90% of your diagnostic
work for you, but at least by monitoring exhaust temp
you can see when something has changed. I have never
used one, so I don't actually know if the scale is
such that a problem would be easily detected.

If you need a sensor lead, I have a couple with
nothing to be used on. -BaH
