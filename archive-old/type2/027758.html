Will the person who left a &quot;Husky&quot; 8mm combination wrench in the engine 
compartment of my bus please come forward to claim it. You know, the wrench 
that fell and got lodged between the fan and fan housing and was making that 
really funny noise. I know it's not mine, because I use &quot;Craftsman&quot;.  Thank 
you all for your help.
