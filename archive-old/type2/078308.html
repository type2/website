Subject: Re: [T2] westy vs. campmobile question

 
--Dolan had a '76 hardtop Westy for some time

--I, too, have a hardtop Westy. It's missing a lot of the camping gear, but it has the rear ceiling cabinet, flip-up table, and the folding rear bed.

I guess I have a '76 hardtop westy as well, as I have all the gear mentioned above, sans hardtop. I always thought it was ripped out of a westy (poptop) and stuffed in my kombi.

Billy
