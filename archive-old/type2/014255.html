Subject: mech. fuel pump pumping too much? flooding problem....

Hello List,

I have yet another question. I searched the archives
but didn't find exactally what I am looking for. I got
my bus &quot;running&quot; today. Yeah! but I have a problem. My
dual carburators automatically flood when I try to
start it. Everything seems to be hooked up and the air
filter is in the air breather. If I pull the gas lines
and plug them, the bus will crank after several tries
and then run for about 10 seconds and then die because
the gas in the bowls has been used up. When I tried
hooking up the gas lines after I got it running, it
would cause the carbs to flood and idle out. What am I
missing? 

I do not see any vacuum hoses that are unhooked and I
DO have my mechanical fuel pump. I see no signs of an
electric fuel pump. (To check for a mechanical fuel
pump, I even unhooked one of the gas lines and turned
the key to the start position and no gas came through
the line). 

Would this problem suggest stuck or incorrectaly
adjusted carb floats? it almost seems like my fuel
pump is pumping too much. Any help would be most
appreciated. Thanks!
