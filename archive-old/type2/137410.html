Hi Volks!
Need some advice, ...snip.... to the effect that if I don't move my bus every
3 days that they will (under Boston law) have it towed
away as an &quot;abandoned vehicle&quot;..David Burton
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
Hi Dave........You need a solution where everybody wins.

Figure out the approximate true value in the local market for your 1971 
Westy ($4,000?).

Add two thousand dollars to that (=$6,000?). Put a &quot;FOR SALE&quot; sign on it 
with that price and your contact information.

Take documentary pictures of the sign, on the car, with a dated front page 
from the local paper.

In this way you can offer to negotiate with the neighbor (or neighborhood 
group) that wants it gone, and he/she/they can make it disappear by 
purchasing it.  The extra dollars can compensate you for fulfilling their 
obsession with controlling what they see from their living room windows.

Find out what it is worth to them to have your bus go away.

I think that it would be a civilized and profitable solution, where 
everyone wins and everyone compromises.
