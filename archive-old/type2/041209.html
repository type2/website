Subject: Tough to get in reverse.

This is on my '72 -
I have a '78 engine in it.  Last month I took out the '72 transmission and
put in one from a '78.  As I was advised by the list I would need to adjust
the linkage.  I finally understood what you were saying when I could not get
it in to 2nd, 4th or reverse.  I adjusted the linkage and I could shift it
in to all gears.  However reverse is really hard to find and 2nd and 4th
take a little more thought than before. - When in gear it sounds and runs
fine.

My questions - Is there any other adjustments I need to make reverse easier?
I am thinking of when you push it down to get it in reverse or possibly
shorten the linkage a bit more -- there is still some room (1.5 inches
about) in 1st and 3rd before smash my knuckles in to the dash.


Thank You
