Yesterday while driving back from an interview (with a VW 
dealer, no less) the Temp light started flashing then the needle 
pegged... limped a mile or so down the road to the next exit and pulled 
off... as I pulled into a BK parking lot several Good Samaritans pulled 
in behind me, jumping out with extinguishers at the ready...Van looked 
like old Faithful....Steam plume 'bout 30 feet high...

        called for a flatbed tow and 45 minutes later The Beast and I 
are sitting in the drive...

        Question is: could a stuck thermostat have caused the head 
gasket to blow...?

        I had done the Head gaskets and had a tiny crack welded on both 
heads back just after Christmas ('bout 10K ago) and she has been running 
 just fine...not a drop...then 'bout two weeks ago I noticed when I got 
back from some errands that she had burped up 'bout a cup of coolant 
after I had stopped and gone inside...nothing since and couldn't even 
find where it had come from... the last coupla weeks have been quite hot 
and humid (90s and 80-90% humidity, too hot for New England)...

        Hoping the Head isn't warped this time...
