&gt;  More of concern with this conversion is the absence of the bulkheads

found
&gt;  triangular braces (3&quot; - 4&quot;) welded at floor level behind the seats.
&gt;  Original or converted?  Good thing or bad?  I get a nice warm feeling
&gt;  reading/hearing about how VW designers over-engineered the structure of the
&gt;  bus.  I get nervous thinking that a converter or PPO thought they knew more
&gt;  than VW.

Hi Allen and the list,

The removal of the bulkheads is a modification desired by many people to 
enable the fitting of rotating seats which would make the cab seats usable 
while camping and giving a larger usable space in the rear; and is very 
effective.

For the 78 and 79 (or maybe just 79) model years VW did produce T2s
without bulk heads but only in Deluxe minibuses; the strengthening which 
replaced the bulkhead was an L shaped bracket 250mm long on each leg, 20mm 
wide and 8mm thick at the corner tapering to 4mm thick at the ends. This 
bracket goes up the door pillar and out across the rear upper edge of the 
seat pedestal.
NB dimensions are approximate and are from memory of a friends bus.

Because there were T2 busses made by VW without bulkheads the VW Type 2 
Owners Club (www.soft_dot_net_dot_uk/vwt2oc) contacted VW about the removal of 
bulkheads and received a written reply that this did not effect the 
structural integrity of the vehicle PROVIDED that a strengthening bracket is 
used in its place.

So from the arrangement you describe (and the vehicles age) I would think 
that think that the bulkhead removal has been done by a previous owner or 
converter.

You yourself must judge if the strengthening and workmanship used in  
removing the bulkheads is adequate.

To help you with this VW themselves still produce T2 busses in Brazil and 
these come off the production line WITHOUT bulkheads neither do they have the 
late 70s L shaped bracket but a triangular plate in the corner. This plate is 
180mm high, goes across the bus for 250mm is 1mm thick and has a 5mm lip bent 
forward at right angles to the plate on the sloping edge. The plate is from 
the same sheet of steel as the rear side of the seat pedestal.
These measurements are accurate as I've just been out to my 1998 Brazilian T2 
and measured them.

As a point of interest the seat belt mountings are now taken through this 
plate rather than down through the seat pedestal.

This plate may be seen at 
www.soft_dot_net_dot_uk/vwt2oc/BWallace/html/r950vhy/amazsnow.htm
and follow the 'But what does it look like inside?' link.

Please (everybody) note, that it is the concessus of opinion on this list 
that the T2s being produced in Brazil cannot be legally imported into the USA 
or Canada (please consult the archives for details). Therefore threads on the 
importation of T2s from south to north America is a banned topic on the list. 
Also I did not import my van into the UK but bought it from Beetles (UK) who 
import them commercially; their web site is www.beetles-uk_dot_com
I will not reply to E-mails asking me how to import Brazilian T2s into any 
country in the world even the UK. Sorry.

good luck
