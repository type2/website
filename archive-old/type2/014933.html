Subject: re: Getting in ... 
Mime-Version: 1.0

&gt;Can anyone suggest a method of opening my van without damaging it? 
&gt;(1978 transporter) It's locked with the keys in the ignition, I need to 
&gt;get it open before someone else does...Miles, Kent, UK.

Okay, now that everybody has given the *right* answers for getting into a
locked bus, here's what works for me.

I have a '79 with standard sliding side windows.  The passenger side
windows have a somewhat poorly designed locking mechanism... I have found
(actually, a friend of mine who wanted to leave me a not once did this)
that a quick hit with the heel of your palm on the outside protrusion of
the window mechanism will just slide that window open.  This is also a good
thing to try just to see how secure your bus is.  If you have sliding
windows, they tend to be simpler than doors to open.

Has anybody else noticed this?
