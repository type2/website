Hi everyone.
I'm a first-poster who'll be annoying y'all for some time to come re:
restoring our '72 Westy.
Right now, the only thing that's keeping us from roadtesting our new
addition is (specifically) the ignition key cylinder, (missing key)
although I'll be having all the cylinders re-keyed onto a common blank this
week.
Whilst I understand that the ignition key is going to be a pain, my question
to you is how I get the back hatch open in order to remove this cylinder.
BTW, just to make it a bit clearer, I have a spare ignition cylinder set
that I'll be bringing in for re-keying, and will be facing retrofitting this
later next week.
So.... 1/ How do I pop the back hatch?
         2/ Any advice on removing the wheel, column etc to refit the &quot;new&quot;,
spare ignition cylinder would be GREATLY appreciated!

Many thanks, (apologise for the length)
Rick Steller
