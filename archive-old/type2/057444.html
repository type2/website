Subject: Plugging Into My 79

Hey All --
I have an electrical question for anyone who can help -- and please excuse
this question (if applicable) as I am fairly unexperienced when it comes to
volts, watts and electrical systems for busses and homes, and would rather
ask one or more experts out there rather than just go ahead and &quot;touch the
damn wires together and see what happens.&quot;  Anyway, here goes:

I have a 79 Riviera camper with an auxiliary battery/isolator setup.  I've
been preparing for a trip to Baja for some time and want to find a way to
hook up some little clip-on dashboard fans to the aux battery for cooler
driving.  (Would also like to rig up little things like reading lights and
such too.)  Well, I've been neglecting to notice that this camper is
actually equipped with a couple of standard-looking double wall sockets
(tho different from the infamous &quot;silver socket&quot;).  My first thought was
&quot;Cool, I'll just plug the fans into the sockets&quot; and away we go.  Now, I'm
thinking the socket (12V, I assume) and fan (label says 120V - 60Hz)  are
made for entirely different electrical systems.  Can an appliance of this
voltage be simply plugged into a socket for a 12V battery (and will I cook
my electrical system and/or me), or is some type of adaptation/converter
needed?  Do appliances that can be rigged up to run off the auxiliary
battery need to specifically be &quot;12V&quot; appliances and no higher?  

Thanks in advance for your help!
