&gt; So, do I need to take the rock shield off under the bus, or is this
&gt; something I do on the inside?  The light does work at the
&gt; selector...just
&gt; a bit dim.

&gt;&gt;I'm glad you mentioned you have an automatic, because that changes the
&gt;&gt;answer.  First, no, the reverse lights have nothing to do with the hazard
&gt;&gt;flasher switch.
&gt;&gt;On an automatic Bus, the reverse lights are controlled via a switch in the
&gt;&gt;base of the shifter on the cab floor.  You may have to get in there and
&gt;&gt;take a look.  While you're in there you can get the light that lights up
&gt;&gt;the gear selector display at night working :-)

I have replaced the switch that you refer to, in my '78 automatic Westy.
It was 6 years ago and I'm a little fuzzy on details, but as I recall,
there is a nifty little 5(?) position 3(?)contact switch attached to the
base of the gear shifter. You can see it if you remove the plastic box
that covers the base of the shifter. As I recall, there's a little
springloaded contact that touches a little brass set of contacts and this
turns on the backup lights and also routes current to the ignition switch
so you can only start the bus when you're in Park or Neutral. Mine was
worn out from 150K miles of shifting. I was able to get a replacement from
VW for a couple of bucks.  (Encinitas, CA, where they treat old bus owners
better than any other VW parts place I've been). I seem to recall that it
was a little tricky to replace because to get at one side of the switch
requires removing the arm of the shifter, which in my bus was frozen so
tight that (in John Muir's words), &quot;Even God himself couldn't budge it.&quot;
It looked like maybe I could just slip the thing out and slip the other
one in with needlenose pliers and a little skill, but I couldn't. And then
I had the old one screwed up so my bus wouldn't start (because the switch
also connects the ignition, as I mentioned above). So I had my bus towed
to VW (Encinitas, CA) and they did it for me. Just a little stupid job, if
you can move that immoveable object and I couldn't budge that sucker.
They had (in 1994) a pricing structure for work where they didn't charge
me by how long it really took but by how long it said in their book it was
supposed to take. That was suposed to be a quick and easy swap (and it
would be if the %*&amp;$#!! shifter arm could come off). So they spent several
hours cussing and trying every stuck bolt trick in the book to get it out,
but it only cost me $50. Yay! Better them than me.

Before you go to that much trouble, you might try getting in to where you
can see that switch and jumping it with wire clips or something to see if
that lights up your backup lights and thus really is the source of your
backup light problem.

Your actual mileage may vary.

Good luck,
