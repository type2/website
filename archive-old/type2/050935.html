Subject: [T2] More info on 68-73 Westies wanted

		OK, now I am really interested in all the changes. I am
wanting to make a separate page on my site just for these years. I want to
document all the changes. So, If you have any good pictures of 68-73
interiors, cabinets, cots, poles for the child's cot, anything that is
original, please send it to me and I will make a page for it. Send any info
you have, like the year, and anything that you have changed. I will also
include pictures of my very rare SO-69 interior(stove, sink, Electrolux
fridge, and extra closet).
		Someone already has a site with tons of info on the 76-79
style, so I think its time for the 68-73 to have a page. It may help new
comers to identify what is there and what is missing, and what years to look
for the right parts in.
