Subject: Re: [T2] CAD files in the archive idea

Here is a link to the first page that I am working on for the people with
Acad to look at. It is called panels.dwg on this page:
http://www.72camper_dot_com/panels.htm
I am obviously in the middle of it  :)   but any suggestions are fine.

&gt; The files I am going to put on my site will always be there. If anyone
wants
&gt; to add them to the type2 library feel free. They are for the community.
&gt;
&gt; Right now I am working on making each individual detail in 3 forms.
&gt;
&gt; 1) In full size for anyone who can plot them fullsize, which would be more
&gt; rare than not.
&gt;
&gt; 2) Each detail on a 24 X 36 sheet at 2&quot; = 1'-0 scale that most people with
&gt; Autocad experience or access to a printer type firm in their town can plot
&gt; them out.
&gt; This would also mean that most of the panels for a Westy would fit on
about
&gt; 3 sheets. This is what I am doing now. I am also trying to make sure that
&gt; this scale would allow me to plot out the drawing and scan each individual
&gt; detail on my scanner. That means that each panel can be read by anyone
with
&gt; internet access. It would be a .jpeg or .bmp file.
&gt;
&gt; 3) Blowing up each of these panels to fit a 24 x 36 sheet. This is what I
&gt; would ship to people who have no access of a file reader of any sort (or
&gt; someone who just wants big full size drawings).
&gt;
&gt; Once again I have no problem with anybody making copies or passing them
out
&gt; or putting them on the library.
&gt;
&gt; I am not the only one doing these drawings, but I feel sure they agree.
&gt;
&gt; I am going to post the first detail in .dwg form of the rear panel in a
few
&gt; minutes. The measurements were taken by Russell and I added the
dimensions,
&gt; etc.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; --Rob says his site will offer .dwg and .plt files IIRC, and there is
&gt; strong support of .pdf files also.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Why not offer the pdf. file from the same place, which will be
democratic,
&gt; and require some admin. volunteer time. I run autocad, but I don't know
how
&gt; to convert to .pdf.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; and/or: post the link to the &quot;volo view&quot; download so folks can see the
&gt; .dwg's if they want to go that way. Most of us who will be drawing will be
&gt; using the .dwg format I would guess.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; can we get this whole affair on type2_dot_com?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; We'll need standardized title blocks with pertinent info so these
drawings
&gt; don't become useless if revised later.
