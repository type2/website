Hey Todd,
Here's what I'd do.  I'd bust out your wiring diagram and pull out the 
plug that goes into the ignition switch.  Then following the diagram of 
how the ignition switch would work, hotwire the plug with some test 
leads and see if it drives the starter.  If that works, then I'd do some 
continuity tests with a multimeter to see if your ignition switch is 
working correctly.

good luck!
Mike

&gt; Ok, well, I shorted out the ignition (starter) wire with the positive lead
&gt; from the battery, and sure enough, I heard the starter motor come to life.
&gt; So... now I know that both my brand new wiring harness is good as is my
&gt; starter.
