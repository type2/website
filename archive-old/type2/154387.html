Subject: hYDRAULIC LIFTERS ON SOLID LIFETR CAM, LOBE PROFILES

I was talking to a fellow VW Bus enthusiast/mechanic, and asked him about
hydraulic lifters on a solid lifter cam profile.  He said &quot;doable&quot;, but lots
of &quot;clatter&quot; on cold start up and there would prolly be some loss of lift due
to the hydraulics.  Other than the &quot;fluid&quot; interchange in the lifter, and if
it is primed, what possible loss could there be, and does the cam lobe know
the difference between a hydraulic and a solid lifter?  opinions gladly
endorsed and appreciated!
