Subject: Pertronix ignitor woes

Catastrophic loss of power this morning on the way to work. Eventually 
traced to pertronix ignitor by the roadside. This post is really a 
warning. I pulled the engine for the first time last week, and in the 
process of reinstalling must have pulled the ignitor wires coming out of 
the distributor. I had forgotten that the pretronix wires needed to be 
carefully positioned along the edge of the inside of the distributor. By 
pulling them I had inadvertently straightened them resulting in them 
interfering with the magnetic bit of the system, and after a few 
thousand revolutions, I had cut through one of the wires.

At least I hadn't done anything really expensive.....just took a bt of 
tape to patch it up, and off I roared to a round of applause from the 
watching truckers and van drivers.
