Subject: RE: [T2] Magfire electronic ignition??? 

We have sold over 1200 of the Magfire units and the return rate on them
has only been approximately 3%. We have not experienced any major problems
with these units and consider them a very cost effective way to eliminate
points on stock engines. Please remember if you are thinking of installing
one, it is meant to be used with a stock coil.

   These were manufactured in Taiwan by Latest Rage( if you read the mag ads
you have seen them) There is a 90% per-cent return ratio and were recalled
due to massive failures.
