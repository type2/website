Joseph -
Don't do it man, don't do it.  There's only one thing worse than a 
supposedly cured vdubaholic.  That is one in denial.  Oh wait that 
reminds me, I heard about one near the Nile, a '63 Deluxe Safari, 
$200 only used by a little old Egyptian, can freight it for only $50!
Once smitten by the bus, always smitten.  There is no turning back.  
You may have left vedubs behind (but only cause the price was too 
high) but they have infested your blood.  The next one that goes by 
will be beaconing you, like a siren's song.  Hey there's an ambulance 
in that field with a siren still attached!  Thanks Joseph for saving 
me from myself, or at least that '67 YOU found.  I have an '80 but 
every time I see a splitty, the desire is there, the drive (slow as 
it was) is in me to get another one.  It's all I can muster (convince 
my spouse) to get another '80 as *spares*.  The fact that I'll have a 
Westi Vanagon to play with (as in pull off top and get a BIG sunroof 
like my '64 deluxe) has nothing to do with it.  Now if I can only 
figure out how to put in a bunch of little windows . . . .
But I am not addicted, I can quit anytime I like, BUT I DON'T want to 
quit, yes I do, no I don't . .aargh . . time for an oil change.
