Hi Volks.
I want to swap a dash, putting a 70 dash into my 69.

Has anyone done this?

It looks like the padded vinyl part DOES NOT separate from the top metal 
part which goes forward to underneath the windshield.

I noticed two (or is it three?) large phillips screws on either side, in the 
front door posts, and a series of smaller screws in the top near the bottom 
edge of the windshield (screw heads covered by black plastic caps)

I imagine you have to remove the steering wheel and column brace, e-brake 
lever too.

So how hard/easy is it?
