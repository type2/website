The factory fridge in my 77 Westy is a true refridgerator. It is an ammonia
system made by Dometic. It WILL make ice cubes in the 2 little ice cube
trays on 120v AC. It is a 12v DC system. 120v AC goes to the transformer and
gets stepped down to 12v. The 12v aux battery is for running the fridge
while driving between camp sites/hookups. The 4.5 amp draw heating element
will kill a fully charged battery in 6 hours if you are parked.


&gt; That brings me to a question for the list, how
&gt; effective are the different models of refrigerators
&gt; that Volkswagen used in their Westies? Could they keep
&gt; things like dairy or meat products at safe
&gt; temperatures in the blazing heat of the summer? Would
&gt; they be more effective than the electric 12v coolers?
