Subject: [T2] valve adjust after rocker removal?

&gt;..... a friend is needing a replacement manual transmission for his '74.
&gt;What range of year model donor vans would be compatible with his? And if he
&gt;finds one at a wrecking yard, what are the the things you can do to evaluate
&gt;it, if any?

The match is 73 1/2 to 75, count five ribs on the top of the case.
Drain it into a clean white bucket. If you find gear chunks,
( use a telescope magnet ) or if the gear oil looks like
metallic paint ( brass shine ), reject it. Metal fuzz on the drain
plug is normal.
