Not to be Mr. Smartypants, but I specifically remember my gen light on my '71 being blue.

I'm thinking this is a test harness wire. Later '71's and Eurospec '71's had test harnesses and I'm guessin' that's what this wire is.

Thanks! Joe (smartypants) Fournier

&gt;sounds like the wire to the &quot;Gen&quot; light it is a gray wire that connects to
&gt;a similar wire that comes through the fire wall.  look for a loose wire
&gt;near the starter motor.
&gt;
&gt;if that isn't it.  you got me hanging
