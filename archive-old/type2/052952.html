Subject: Re: j-tubes or heat exchangers?

I have some heater boxes which look original and
and since just the case around the boxes is in bad shape
was wondering how you went about patching them.
My exhaust system is of now and I am figure this is the
best time if ever to work on it.
Did you buy one of those exhaust patch kits at a FLAPS?
and if so does that stuff work on big holes?

thanks

&gt;J-tubes do take the place of heat exchangers, eliminating the
&gt;heat-transfer boxes and therefore your heat.
&gt;
&gt;I'd recommend that you take another look at the old boxes.  Original &gt;boxes
&gt;are the best and are very difficult to find.  I've found that the &gt;boxes
&gt;are easily patched by brazing patches over the holes and reinforcing &gt;where
&gt;the exhaust pipe enters/exits with a metal sleeve.
&gt;The condition of the heater boxes has little bearing on engine &gt;overheating
&gt;except that leaky boxes can divert a bit more air from the fan.
&gt;
&gt;For heaven's sake, don't throw the old boxes away, even if you don't &gt;use
&gt;them.  Someone will find them useful down the road!
