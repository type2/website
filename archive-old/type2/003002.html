Subject: primo 71 transvair bus for sale


&gt;I have a completely restored 71 bus with a corvair 110 hp motor and corvair
&gt;transaxle, it has been in shows , very clean, also has westy interior, this
&gt;bus is aqua green bottm and off white top, I bought the transvair kit about
&gt;ten years ago and it fits and runs like a dream, no more driving in the
slow
&gt;lane.
&gt; I have to go and will be back on friday asking 4,000.00 but the torque
&gt;converter is leaking bad ...so if I fix it it will be 4,000.00 if you buy
as
&gt;is I WOULD CONSIBER 2500.00  .
&gt;paint is awsome, interior is awesome . 2 years i had the whole front end
&gt;rebuilt .engine has less than 75,000 miles on it and just recently I had
the
&gt;heads done by FF HEADS in riverside calif. they installed all new valve
&gt;seats. it has dual exhaust and all new brakes ,hoses calipers ,drums pads
&gt;and shoes and I even installed a new vacume assit unit for the brakes,
&gt; I have had this bus in this configuration for 11 years and it has been
&gt;totally reliable......._dot_call me at (909) 678-4968 thats in Lake Elsinore
&gt;Calif
&gt;
&gt;thanks.......Keith Jensen.
