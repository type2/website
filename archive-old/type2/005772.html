The standard cylinder base gasket is .010 in. thick.
It may be left out, but it depends on your measuring &quot;deck height&quot;.
this is how far the piston comes to the top of the barrel,
and should include a &quot; margin &quot; for piston rock ( wobbles on the wrist pin ).
Discretion prevents me from suggesting that you can go as low as.035 in
clearance and be safe. Safe is like .050 or more.

The standard head gasket is around .035 in. this may also be left out.

Both gaskets relate to the compression ratio. Leaving them out will
increase compression, insofar as you will be squeezing the fuel mix
into a smaller payload . High compression means more horsepower.
Too high leads to premium gas and detonation, holes in the piston, etc.
Low compression is for less power, cheaper fuel, and less risk.

the .010 cylinder base gasket will make a small CR change, the .035 head gasket
will be more significant. You may want to consider the procedures for measuring
cylinder head combustion chamber volume and the formulas for CR and
building an engine to your liking. Try the library at type2 and good luck.

&gt;I am getting ready to put my 1800 back together and have a question.
&gt;Are there suppossed to be gaskets between the case and the cylinders?
&gt;What about the cylinders and the heads?
