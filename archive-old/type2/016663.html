Subject: Hot start relay problem(??)

Froiden:

After a  real PITA experience with bad electrics, I took the time to
sort through the ignition circuts on my `76 westie, in essence I replace
the connections to the starter and replaced the ignition switch - it
comes in TWO parts - the tumbler portion and a electrical switch that
lives below it. The procedure is long and rather difficult due to the
problem of drilling out the retaining shear bolt. If anyone is
interested in my experiences, pmail me and I'll pass my procedure along.

While in the e-lek-trickle mode I decided to finally put hot start
problems to rest by doing the  famous relay install. Now let me say this
-I have the smallest working knowlege of electrical workings of anyone
on the planet, (I don't know why the juice doesn't run out of a wall
outlet when there's nothing plugged in :)  but I used the the sources
available from hoover, muir, bartnik,et.al. and boiled the deal down to
this:

1. mount three-prong 12v relay on fire wall (self grounding)
2. run wire FROM ignition switch to *IN* connection of relay.
3. run wire from *OUT* connection on relay to *IGN* connector on starter
solenoid.
4. run wire from *BATT* connection on relay to &quot;B&quot; on voltage regulator.

My questions are:

Which one is  the &quot;B&quot;  post on the voltage regulator??
What happens to the wire that *USED* to go there?? Do you splice into it
or take it out altogether??

My westie has been converted from FI to a weber,so the electronics are
no longer the same, but the connector to the voltage reg looks stock. It
is a push-on type and attaches to three posts.

I await your collective input.
