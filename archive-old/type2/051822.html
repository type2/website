Subject: Re: [T2] installing door seals- making your bus quiet

You can buy generic dynamat from JC whitney, in fact i believe it is
exactly the same sans the dynamat label as i have used both.  you can
simply use plastic sheeting as an effective vapor barrier. you can buy
plastic sheeting at hardware stores and paint stores as used for plastic
ground cloths. if trying to soundproof your bus using carpet padding is a
very effective method, it is rated in the number of psi it can support,
the higher the value the denser the material and the more effective at
blocking low frequency road noise, it too is fairly cheap. I highly
recomend NOT using the roofing material as suggested in the article in
the type2 library, i did this and it is my biggest regret concerning my
bus if i could undo it i would in a heart beat.  the dynamat (or
equivalent) and foam are very adequate and effective in making your bus
alot quieter.  i found the front door rubber to be an easy install except
that you need to get the rubber around the hinge which can be a pita.
the sliding door seal is very easy as is the rear hatch, just smoosh it
in there. my bus is dead quiet inside, if anyone wants details on how i
got it that way pmail me.
good luck 
jamie
