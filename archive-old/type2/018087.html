Hello...me again with my shifting problem.
If you remember a week or two ago I had a problem where my &quot;hockey
stick&quot; would swivel underneath my dash board...but wouldn't swivel all
the way to the left where it should.  It feels like its shifting into
gear (feels and I can hear it) when I push it up or down...this only
works when it is as far left as it will go.....
Does anyone have any diagrams for this sort of thing???  I could really
use them.... none of the manuals really had anything that I could
find...nor did the archives... so if anyone has found different...please
share....
I could also use some detailed instructions on how to fix it because I
would like to get it done this weekend...
Thanx for your help!

Oh yeah...and Ras Dave I think it is....send me a p-mail
