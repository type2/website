I used a GPS all last summer. It was great, apart from giving
stats like avg speed, total time, stopped time, max speed, distance covered
etc, I have marked all the camp sites as waypoints and have downloaded the
routes onto my computer, so now I have a map of exactly where I covered last
year, an electronic diary.

Plus, in theory you should never get lost again! It's not cheap and doesn't
replace the feel and pleasure of good maps, but a GPS is a lot of fun and
highly recommended.

&gt; &gt;OK Mountain Folks,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Who has successfully put an altimeter in their bus, and become
&gt; &gt;pleased with what they bought?
&gt; &gt;If happy, what did you install?
&gt; &gt;Analog - Digital - Model ?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I'm looking to install one in Casper so I can see how high we go as
&gt; &gt;we go higher. :-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Does not need to have a low level scale for Houston peaks known as
overpasses.
&gt;
&gt; I was thinking of getting GPS. You can altitude from them as well
&gt; locations, distance travelled and so on. Prices are getting real good
&gt; for the basic models.
&gt;
&gt; I spent 21 years as a ship's navigator, I would have loved to have
&gt; one a GPS. Back then GPS's were bigger than my bus and were not
&gt; installed on destroyers and frigates. When off soundings I mostly
&gt; used a sextant, chronometer and compass, LORAN was only good in
&gt; certain areas and Omega, in my opinion, was the biggest waste of
&gt; money in navigational history.
&gt;
&gt; I am getting old and spoiled.
