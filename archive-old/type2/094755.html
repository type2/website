Subject: Re: [T2] 1970 westy~sliding door inside handle



&gt;OK, then you need the double-ended handle.
&gt;Like I said in my 1st reply, it is pretty much unobtainable now. Very rare 
&gt;to
&gt;show up on ebarf.
&gt;The double-end made it slightly easier to open the door with the sink unit 
&gt;in
&gt;place. If you don't have the sink unit, you can use the standard handle.... 
&gt;as
&gt;pictured in the ebarf link I sent earlier.
&gt;


And where are those cool wood workers now? A nice wood replica wood (pun 
intended) be the best thing since a childs cot.
