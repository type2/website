Subject: Driver/pass. door window chrome removal- Help!

Hi all,

I'm right in the middle of my Westy project getting everything stripped =
for
welding, sanding and painting and have run into a stumbling block. =20

How the heck do you remove the chrome (and rubber along the bottom) =
that
goes around the outside of the windows?=20

I've gotten to the point where the quarter windows are out and I've =
pulled
the felt out as well so I can see how the top and sides will come out. =
The
problem is the rubber/chrome part that runs along the (bottom) outer =
sill of
the door and is attached below the window sill. Bentley conveniently =
skips
removal info for that part. Any help is appreciated...

For those who may be curious:

My Westy restoration project is moving along well. I'm basically =
replacing
all window, door, and pop top rubber (not a cheap prospect) and most =
likely
will go for a new pop top tent as well. I pulled out all the windows =
and was
pleasantly surprised at the lack of rust except for 2 places. First the =
left
rear window quarter panel is rusted beyond economical repair. (Anyone =
out
there got a replacement they'd like to get rid of?- If not I'll =
probably go
for single piece glass instead.)=20

The other location is the infamous lower windshield sill. I started =
prying
there and the metal started crumbling. :-(  I don't think it is as bad =
as it
could be but the westy will definitely need some reconstructive surgery =
in
that area....

After that it is just to remove the poptop and luggage rack and she is =
all
set for metal work and painting.

Latest new parts scored: a Weber progressive (Please hold your derisive
remarks until I get a chance to see for myself... ;-) and some cool =
smoked
tail lights from &quot;that auction site&quot;, and a bunch of new rubber (on =
order in
the U.K.).

TIA,

John B.
