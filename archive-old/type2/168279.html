Subject: Rounding third...

For the last couple of years, I have been battling various vacuum leaks that
have been causing me serious headaches.

Today, I noticed something very interesting that I'm sure has to do with the
starting problems I have been dealing with.

After I started my van, I started pumping the brake and noticed that when I
pumped the brake, the engine struggled. However, when I took my foot off the
brake, it idled fine. Also, I noticed that there was a heavy breathing noise
I heard whenever I hit the brake that was coming from the area of my front
wheel. I looked around there, but could not see any obvious leaks.

It seemed that Bentley was directing me to the Brake Booster, but this is
one area of the vacuum system I know ZILCH about. I really am out of my
element in the correlation between the engine and the brakes.

Has anyone else dealt with something like this?
