&lt;&lt; s there a easy  way of removing the clip that
 holds the cv joint to the axle?
 I tried using screw drivers to pry it of and pliers
 but just got more mad at the darn thing.
 How do you guys do it?

Buy a pair of pliers designed to remove clips. They come with interchangeable

specialized tool and get mad at the damn things.
