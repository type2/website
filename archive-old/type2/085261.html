Subject: Re: Temperature Gauge readings - Empirical data

I've posted about this before:

My CHT sender is mounted on the #3 exhaust manifold just downstream from the 
flange (before it enters the heater box).  I had someone weld a big old bolt 
on there.  Previously, with the sender mounted under a nut on the stud 
closest to the spark plug, when the sender went south, I had to pull the 
engine to replace it.  The temp fluctuates much more readily in the new 
location, and I suspect it runs a little hotter too.  It is usually around 
350 and if it goes up to 450 (long, slow hill), I'll pull off and pop a top 
on my favorite frosty beverage and let it cool with the engine off.  Ambient 
temperature doesn't effect it much.

My oil temp gauge is new (to me) and I have yet to see it get above 200 
degrees.  It's slow to get there (I ain't got no flaps).  It also depends on 
the ambient temperature.

My oil pressure on a new engine (&lt;5000 miles) is around 45 _at_ 3500 RPM and 
does not go below 10 at idle (which was a regular occurrence on the old 
engine).

Welcome back Herr Doktor.  I haven't seen you in a while.  I have to agree 
with a lot of what Doktor Tim says.  Use all your faculties -- all your 
senses -- all your powers of observation -- and _make_notes_ (god knows I 
forget), and you and your VW will get along just fine.  You really don't need 
all those gauges and shit, they're just fluff.   But I like fluff.  It is my 
job during the week to test and monitor the nervous system of living, 
breathing human beings.  The &quot;monitor thing&quot; sorta spills over onto my VW 
(which is also a living, breathing being).

Take it for what it's worth to you.  All the usual disclaimers apply.
