Mickey,

Sounds like what you need is the proper tools for the job.  Try and beg,
borrow or steal (OK, maybe not steal) a strobe light and a tach/dwell meter
(or combined setup).  They really are easy to use and take all the guesswork
out of tuneups.  Static timing is OK for a first try to get the motor
running, but dynamic timing with a strobe is more accurate, and you can
check the advance is working at the same time.  The dwell meter tells you if
your point gap is right much better than measuring with a feeler gauge, it
should be as close to 50 degrees as possible.  With the tach, you can set
your idle speed up correctly (900 rpm is about right).  Timing is set at
this speed.  Dwell should not change with engine speed.
If you do it by the book (not by ear) you will get optimum performance and
fuel economy as the designers intended.

&gt; I've got a 2L in a 75 westy and I've set the timing 
&gt; statically according 
&gt; to muir. It backfires a little but otherwise runs fine. 
&gt; should I screw 
&gt; with it ? It doesen't sem to run hot.The points are set a 
&gt; little bit snug 
&gt; on .016.When I time it by ear it ends up around 12* BTDC although it 
&gt; should be at 7.5. I,ve sort of compromised I guess I'm around 
&gt; 9 now.Should 
&gt; I reset the points? I'm planning a 200 mile road trip and 
&gt; don't want to do 
&gt; any damage.
