Subject: Friday bus sightings

Here are a couple of wierd ones:

In the coin video game &quot;Crusin' Exotica&quot; you can race sports cars,
Hummers, Jeeps, etc.  One of the vehicle choices is a splittie bus all
painted up hippie style.

In the animated cartoon version of &quot;Dilbert&quot; one of the artists must be a
VW bus type.  You see quite a few buses driving and parked.  They are
smart enough to know the difference between bays and splitties, as both
types appear, sometimes seconds apart!  &quot;Dilbert&quot; is rerunning
on Comedy Central.
