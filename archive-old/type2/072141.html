Here is my problem:  My wife has been VERY tolerant of my VW obsession,
but the fact that none of my busses has working AC really bugs her (and me)
when it gets really hot on those long trips.  For those of you in cooler,
or dryer climates, you might not understand, but here in Kansas, it can be
100 degrees or more and have 100% humidity!!  Now that's hot.

But not only do we want to air-condition for the trips, but also for those
hot sleepless nights at the campgrounds.  Traditional thinking would say
that I need 2 AC units, one for the bus and a 110 Volt one for the
campground.  But what if we are in a campground with no hookups, then we
would also need a generator!!!  Way too much equipment and expense.

Here is my solution and I would like some feed back as to it's plausibility.

Have you ever seen a tool truck (Snap-On or Mac) with a roof AC unit and
the generator running?  Around here, they leave the generator and AC on all
the time, on the road, or parked at a business.  Why can't I do that with
our '76 Westy?  I would put the generator in a small trailer and pull it
behind the bus with an extension cord hooked to the bus.  The generator
would run when you wanted AC and at the campground, you could park the
trailer a ways from the bus to cut down on noise.  At least the engine
wouldn't be heating up in heavy traffic or lights, but it would add some
towing resistance.

What do you think?  What problems will I run into?  Does towing a small
trailer burn up a 2000 engine?  I am going to install an earlier (69-72)
tranny for lower gears.  I like to drive 60-65 M.P.H. so the lower gear
tranny wouldn't be a problem.

Advantages:  (please feel free to add more)
1.  No need to install all the &quot;plumbing&quot; on the bus.
2.  The roof AC and generator would cost less than trying to put a new AC
unit on a bus.
3.  AC ANY TIME, even when parked at the store, or camping at night, engine
does not need to run.
4.  Extra power for lights when camped.
5.  When you didn't need it, unhook the trailer and leave it.
6.  No need to load and unload a heavy generator when camping, just leave
it in the trailer.
7.  Extra room for camp gear in the trailer.
8.  Only 1 AC unit and it is self contained.
9.  When you get home, just leave the camping gear in the trailer.

Disadvantages:  (please feel free to add more)
1.  Expensive.
2.  Extra weight to tow.
3.  AC unit would have to be permanently mounted to roof of Westy on the
luggage rack.
4.  You have to tow trailer if you want AC.
