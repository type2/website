&quot;Westie&quot;/&quot;Westy&quot; is a slang term for any make of vehicle converted by
Westfalia into a camper.

Type 4 refers to the type of engine - this will have a large aluminium
casting at the rear which acts an air duct and a fan visible through a grid
at the centre rear.

I notice as I read some of the replies to your question that you were being
told that Westfalia ONLY put wedge shaped opening roofs hinged at front and
rear on T2 Transporters - well this just ain't correct as they also fitted a
straight up pop top take a look at www.vanfest_dot_org/1997p25.htm for a 1978
Westfalia T2 Transporter with a straight up pop top.

I know I will get a lot of flack for this but I need to know what the
definition of &quot;westy&quot; is?  I have a 78' &quot;Weekender&quot;, that is the straight up
camper top, not the slanted, and has all the seats still.  Is that
considered a &quot;westy&quot;.  You see I am new to the bus thing.  I have owned bug
all my life and am really good with a type 1 motor but not so good with a
type 2.  Also what is considered a type 4?
Thanks for the help,
Larry Morris
