&gt;OK, I've also got a '78 auto tranny camper with disconnected aux battery and I
&gt;want to get it back online, if only to have a second battery available to
&gt;start this auto tranny beast (which can't be push started). I've read some on
&gt;the subject and thought an isolator was better than a relay in term of
&gt;reliability and in terms of meting out current as needed to each battery
&gt;rather than just indiscriminantly giving 'em both juice.

As for reliability, I've used the same relay since I got my bus 8 years ago
and it's never failed.  As for indiscriminately giving both batteries
juice, I don't see that as a problem.  Never had a need to do otherwise.

The VW manual my bus
&gt;came with has spooky, vague warnings like,'Running the 'frig off the aux
&gt;battery
&gt;may occasionally drain your main battery too,' as if even VW was hedging
&gt;on the
&gt;effectiveness of their stock relay at isolating the aux battery circuits from
&gt;the main.

That's not comforting.

&gt;So what's the deal as you understand it Dave? Why is a relay better than an
&gt;isolator?

This has been discussed on the list before.  Isolators cause a drop in
voltage (somewhere around 0.6V) so your aux battery will not charge as
well.  Relays incur no voltage loss.

&gt;My dad, the old boat guy, says that the most efficient solution would
&gt;be to have a big marine switch to toggle back and forth from A to B battery
&gt;combined with a memory good enough to switch it regularly.

He's right, but I have found that my memory is not good enough to have
something manual, I prefer doing things automatically wherever possible
(the transmission being one huge exception!).

&gt;The diode isolator
&gt;uses about 5% of the juice from alternator to function, but relieves the owner
&gt;of need to remember to switch battery.

5%?  I hope not!  That's like 2.5 amps.

&gt;And a relay, presumably would only fail
&gt;if it stuck open or something, which doesn't sound likely, but literature on
&gt;RV's suggested that an isolator was better than a relay.

Baloney.

&gt;PLease shed a little light here, and thanks for your time.

You can buy the relay through Camping World (I don't have their # handy but
I bet they have an 800 number).  I seem to remember it costing about $14,
but it might have been $9 - I can't remember.  It's silver, cylindrical,
about the size of a Ford starter relay - the main difference being that it
is made for continuous duty.  I've driven... let's see... two weeks ago
Joel and I drove 34 hours straight in my bus and didn't burn the relay out.
I have no doubt I could leave it on for 3400 hours with the same result.
The relay functions completely automatically, just like the isolator would.

The relay is also a snap to install, whereas the isolator requires more
extensive wiring.

Let's see, The isolator is more expensive, requires extensive wiring,
doesn't charge the battery as well, WHY would anyone even consider buying
an isolator?  I don't know why the stupid things even exist.  :-)
