Another item in the duct tape/bailing wire vein is cable ties.  These are
the straight plastic strips that you form into a loop to hold groups of
wires together.  These don't rust, and can be snugged down tightly.  They
come in different lengths/sizes, and can be &quot;daisy chained&quot; together to form
longer ones.  And don't forget to snip off the tails once they're tightened
up.  (Sorry, pet peeve.  :-) )
