Hello:
(snip) 
&gt; D'oh! mine's where the dipstick was. And, btw, it's kinda loose in there,
&gt; I'd like to figure out a way to hold it better, the thing about using a
&gt; little piece of fuel line, didn't make a lot of sense to me...

There is a small rubber tube between the hole in the case where the 
dipstick (or temp sender) goes and the tube in the tin that you see from 
above that you insert the dipstick into.  I guess Doc Williams [&quot;Robert 
S.Williams, MD-laptop&quot; &lt;rwill_at_digitechs_dot_com] simply used a piece of fuel 
line to replace the original part, which is designed (with an expanded 
middle part) to be more flexible in case the two parts don't exactly line 
up. It seems to have worked for him.

(Snip)
(Comment follows...)
Like the rubber coupling disk on the steering discussed awhile ago, maybe 
we all should go crawl under our busses and see what condition this 
little piece of rubber is in after 20+ years....  :^)
