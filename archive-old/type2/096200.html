&gt; I finally thought my '71 Westy was ready to go for early tomorrow morning
&gt; on
&gt; a 3 week trip...fired it up to go for our goodbye dinner, and the brake
&gt; warning light was on...shite...
&gt; 
&gt; When I hit the brakes, warning light went off... ??? When the headlights
&gt; are
&gt; off, brake warning light is also off. When the headlights are on, with the
&gt; brake warning light, the right turn signals and the brake lights don't
&gt; work.
&gt; When the headlights are off, things are ok.

hey mine did this too, 78,  It did it for a few weeks and then stopped,
never did find what caused it???? drove me nuts for months.
 if you find out what it is post it here I would love to fix it what ever
&quot;it&quot; is.
