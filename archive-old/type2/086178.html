The only way to check (fuel pump) is with a pressure gauge you connect to that little hose bibb on one of the metal lines near the injectors. Only then can you properly diagnose your fuel pump 

I says:

Not really. Measuring a running fuel pump output in volume/time to see if it is spec will give you a status on your fuel pump.

The only way to verify what happens past there is with the pressure gauge, but how 'bout this? Instead of spending the money on a pressure gaugue first, replace your fuel lines and see what happens then. If that doesn't work, you know your pumps good, you know your lines are clear, check injector spray pattern, THEN get the pressure gauge to check the pressure regulator (or swap in a known good one).
