Subject: bus for sale sites in the Internet


&gt;It has been a week now since the serious hunt for a replacement for the
&gt;wrecked '69 began. I have been trolling the internet looking for a split
&gt;screen passenger bus that I can afford, is in acceptable condition and is
&gt;within 500 miles of me. I have come across a few sites where there are lots
&gt;of buses but I am wondering if I am overlooking other ones. So far  I am
&gt;trolling:
&gt;
&gt;http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds/classifieds_main.htm and Everett has
&gt;put together a really great site BTW:)

&gt;get filtered?)
