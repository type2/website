Subject: Looking for 62 bus rear window rubber

     
     I've ordered some catalogs but not all of them. I received the June 
     WCM catalog yesterday.  The WCM catalog lists the small rear window 
     gasket for early busses as NA - not available.  Is there another 
     source for small rear window rubber gaskets?
