Subject: Re: [T2] CV problem

I had a '87 Accord hatchback with 180K miles and could not find the source 
for a vibration in the car. I replaced the tires when the old ones wore out 
and checked the bearings which were tight and then checked the wheels for 
an out of round condition.

Had an old tire guy look at it and he put it up on the rack and showed me 
that the CV joints - though not making noise were worn (axial play).

I replaced them myself a month or two later with local FLAPS axles and the 
vibration went away. The vibration was not noticeable at any speed if the 
car was coasting but did exhibit the problem when there was power going 
through the drivetrain. He old tire guy explained that this would cause the 
CV to twist and lightly &quot;lock&quot; off center.

So.. if your half shaft propelled vehicle is demonstrating a weird 
vibration, check your CV joints.

That old Accord? Saw it the other day. 5 years ago I talked to the owner 
after me. It had 257K miles on it. Now I figure at 12K miles a year it 
could have close to 300K miles on it. And yeah - I'm sure it is the same 
car...

Still looks good.

&gt;Mine went  220K and I replaced them still working because I had to pull the
&gt;engine to replace a clutch disk.
&gt;Figgerred it was a lot easier to do sitting than lying on the ground (:
&gt;They had grooves worn into the center and outer rings, but the balls were 
&gt;okay.
