Subject: RE: [T2] Vanagon into Bay

&gt;  Plan is to pull the heads from each motor and have the '77 heads
&gt;  redone. Install on the '82 motor and have a cheap rebuild.


It's been a number of years since I put a Vanagon engine in a Bus
myself, but as I recall the only sticking point was that one of the
engine carrier mount holes is a different size on the bay block versus
the Vanagon block. I don't honestly remember which was larger. I
remember it being an inconvenience to adapt but not insurmountable. Of
course you will need to use the fan shround, heater boxes, etc. from the
bay engine, since the Vanagon alternator, heater exchangers, etc. will
not easily adapt to a Bus.  Also, a '77 bay engine is solid-lifter
(assuming it has a GD engine code, which is correct for '77), whereas
the Vanagon engine is hydraulic.
