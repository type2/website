&gt;I'm not having a lot of luck with my Type 2 1971 Van.

&gt;After purchasing it and spending £600 on the braking system, the engine has
&gt;now seized on me !

&gt;Engine that has seized - Volkspares Gold engine, supposedly with Unleaded
&gt;heads.

Hi- VEGE UK (Chesterfield I think) do recon engines (try Just Kampers)- I'v no
personal experience with VEGE but they seem to be popular and I haven't heard
anything bad said so far !??
I don't think the engine size will make a massive difference for a type 2 for
your speed- guess you know we have a 70 mph limit !!!- but I see your point. I
suggest you take things easy in your bus and adjust your driving to the slow
lane- think of the great view and put your radio/CD on and enjoy the trip
:-)... the recent thread on why they are now considered &quot;slow&quot; is really
enlightening... depends on your perspective I expect. I do about 60-65 on flat
motorways (1600 dual port, single carb standard...) and thats near flat-out
but not to the floor.
If you are doing all your repairs thro' a garage it will cost you the earth
!!!- best to try and learn for yourself--its great fun to boot       !!!
