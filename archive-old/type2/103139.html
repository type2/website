Subject: Re: [T2] Horsepower

&gt;Almost 20 percent more HP, tons more torque,

As I pointed out some more torque not tons

the main bearings are larger,
&gt;the rods are bigger, the case is stronger, it has a built in oil pump and
&gt;full flow oil.
&gt;
Mine has full flow.

&gt;These type 4 style engines will outlast a type 1 engine in a bus 2 or 3 to
&gt;1.
&gt;
Will they? I have not seen this at all. Maybe the 2 liter will but I have 
more friends with dead type 4's of the 1700 and 1800 group then I do type 
1's.
And either way, lets assume you can get 100,000 miles from a type 1 in a 
bus.
(But as I have posted before I have owned and known people with busses who 
have taken their type 1 in a bus to 200 to 300 thousand miles).
OK lets assume 100,000 miles for a VW type 1 enigne in a bus. Now lets 
assume a
type 2 goes 300,000 miles.
So i do 1 rebuild during that time, and then we are ready to rebuild both,
assuming we still own our busses (100,000 miles is a long way!)
I have mine out in 20 minutes. I rebuild it with new bearings new top end. I 
spend about $400 or I could get a used engine for about $350. Then its 20 
minutes back in. And you spend how much? Double? or more? Type 1 is the way 
to go.
