I don't know the definitive answer, but I have seen a 1971 Bus with the
overhead A/C.

&gt;Does anyone know what the first year was that VW decided to include
&gt;A/C in their buses.  I would imagine it was on a Water cooled model.
&gt;I am scheming up a plan to build my dream bus and I am looking into
&gt;the AC option.
