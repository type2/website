Hi folks,

A little info on the 78' Transporter that was in the Washington Post.  The add
said

&quot;'78 Bus, brown, dual weber custom carbs, monster engine, body kind of rough,
$1000 obo.  202-489-7590, leave message.&quot;

The bus is in pretty good shape and the mechanic who worked on it really babied
it.  It says &quot;body kind of rough&quot; which is not really true.  This bus is pretty
solid looking, the only real problem is the rust under the windshield.  I am not
sure how far this has gone, no holes yet.

This bus is a good deal for those who like their bus to motor.  I'd buy it if I
had another set of hands and feet to drive with.

Paul
79 transporter.
