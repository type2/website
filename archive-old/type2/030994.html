&gt; Just bought a 1978 Type 2 Camper Van - Viking Conversion - chose it because of the layout and the heating system worked, but ignored the fact it was heavy to get in and out of gears.

&gt; Limped home and got the engine dropped - the new clutch has gone in a matter of a few miles - the metal backing is blue and the clutch material is worn and broken up on one side.

&gt; Thoughts

been a while since I had a clutch, but it was on a 71.  first thing I
would check is the adjustment, it sounds to me like the clutch wasn't
being fully engaged and slipping a little,.

so check

.  the &quot;droop&quot; in the clutch cable.  this is very important
.  the free play in the clutch, should be just a tad (precise measurment)
when fully released
.  check the springs in the presure plate.  

so what I would do.  
put in a new clutch, presure plate and throw out bearing.

check the &quot;Flex or droop&quot; in the clutch cable.  
then carefully set the &quot;Free play&quot;

if that doesn't work, check out an automatic tranny ;8*!
