Subject: Re: [T2] Tank Rust after firewall pull.

Okay it's the 4th and I thought I would try a little fire works. Engine is 
complete and ready to install. I pressure washed the engine bay. Pulled the 
fire wall. Disconnected lines pulled the tank not such a pain in the ask me 
how I did it. Filler neck elbow is shot need to order one Tues. breather 
lines are original and crumbly as expected. Pulled all getting ready to 
install new ones. Pressure washed the outside of the tank a few small spots 
of rust on the outside. Now just from first glances with a flashlight very 
little rust more like fresh metal that has a light dusting, no craters or 
flakes. Time is limitted so are funds. Any cheap suggestions to clean it 
out? No varnish or black goo, particles, etc. Nice I guess but about the 
light rust. Is this something to be really concerned about? I will be 
rebuilding another engine in the next year or two to replace the GEX. Is 
this rust something that can wait?

About those fireworks. I will just watch this year no problems today playing 
with the gasoline.
