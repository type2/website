Subject: Re: [T2] bumper reflective tape

Well, I suppose you are right about the illegality of displaying the orange
triangle SMV sign... it's prohibited in Pennsylvania statutes too...and
perhaps other States too.

And to think that a dangerous outlaw like myself has been ranging free,
flatgrantly ignoring the laws, whilst indangering the population at large!!
I ought to just &quot;turn in my bus pass&quot; and retire before my ignorance results
in furthur damage to the list's perspective.

And, yikes! To think that I've traversed WV just a couple of months ago
without incident.

BTW: I did find this little blurb with FindLaw ... from the fines imposed in
Yellowknife. Northwest Territory, Canada:

Unauthorized sign 127 $100.00
Insecure load 130 $100.00
Splashing pedestrian 131 $ 50.00
Obstructing Highway 132 $100.00

So, you can splash two pedestrians for the same cost as displaying an
Unauthorized sign on you vehicle, Eh?
