Subject: Subaru to Type II retrofit

I apologize to everyone for the delay in posting Part 4 of the retrofit.  I
have been working major hours.  At this time I'm not sure when I get it
posted...I'll keep trying.

Fortunately I have been CNC machining a lot of VW parts and billet VW
goodies.  Some of the stuff I just finished has been sold in Japan and
England, so I'm hoping that this will be a my new line of work.

The Subaru Doublecab is still running great with 20,500 miles on retrofit.
I'll be caravanning to Rocky point, Mexico on thanksgiving....a good test of
reliability.  (I'm taking my tow bar)
