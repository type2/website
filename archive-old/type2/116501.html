Wow, fiesty list this week.

&gt;It costs money to operate a retail store and keep
&gt;a relatively slow moving auto part on the shelf for &gt;one, two, three months, just so it will be waiting &gt;at your beck and call when you run in
&gt;five minutes after closing with a broken down bus.

I am aware of this, Ron. Conversely, if it werent' for volks drivers like myself who stick with their vehicles as california attempts to pry them out of our hands there would be no market for these guys.

You should also consider my background. This isn't the east coast where most v-dubs have long since rotted and you're trying to have a parts outpost in 
v-dubless wasteland.

This is central california. I can count 10-15 vw's in 3 block radius of my house and I'm not kidding. Plus, have you heard of Pismo beach or dune buggies?

These guys showroom is full of chrome and steroids. Come in and try to talk a little vintage or bus-talk? Not interested. 

I'm a very polite person, Ron, and they act annoyed at me everytime I show up and then argue with me that you can replace 8A fuses with 16A fuses because they have them.

&gt;Not to mention the fact that they helped you out &gt;even though you walked in after closing,

Last time I checked, that was called customer service if you want return business. I have bent over at my jobs for clients throughout my working life for the very same reasons.

&gt;Far from ripping you off, they hooked you up.

I'd call it 50/50.

&gt;Speaking as someone who sells
&gt;the cable for about $4 myself

Or 5.95....

&gt;even I'd have to admit that you more than
&gt;got your extra six bucks worth. 

Negative ghostrider, I got 5 bucks worth from the tow truck drive who backed up into my yard and put the bus down on my concrete slab where it's covenient for me to work on before he knew I was tipping him a 5'ver.

That's service.
