Learn from my experience!  If you don't feel comfortable with the
mechanic, get a pickup and tow dolly and take the bus to someone you
trust.  The money you spend will be well worth the peace of mind it buys.
I had a c*evy break down on the road and had it fixed 200 miles from home.
I would have been better off to just set it on fire, as the bill kept
escalating and the repair had to be redone after I finally got it home.
