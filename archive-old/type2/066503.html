&gt; the bus stop catalog and the ones they had were $73 a pair, and weren't
&gt; stock. I don't care if they're stock or not but I need them to be a little
&gt; more reasonably priced. BTW, I can't find a VW junk yard anywhere near here. :(

Tom,
Where are you located?  I have several extra parts for my bus, and I'm 
in the process of a restoration.  I need to locate all my bumper parts
and find the best ones (of course for me), and I'm sure I have another
good set (for a lot less than $73).  Are you in a rush?  Let me know.

Do you have any parts you would like to get rid of....say, interior
parts or other assorted body parts????
