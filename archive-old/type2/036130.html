I sent him an E-mail expressing an interest in his bus, as I have a 
spare perfect engine, but have not received anything back as of yet.

My idea was to put my literally brand new engine in his bus, and then 
sell the whole thing to a deserving, &quot;promise to baby her&quot; type for 
what I would have in the thing.

The engine is surplus to my needs and in excellent shape; all original 
OEM German issue, so it might make somebody out there a nice bus for 
not much money.
