&gt; I think Speedy's leaking oil from behind the pulley.  Finding sprinkles
&gt; on the fan shroud, and a little puddle on the tin to the left of the
&gt; distributor, I replaced the oil pressure switch, the distributor o-ring,
&gt; and added a breather box (vented at valve covers, plummed back to the
&gt; oil spout.  Now, I'm still getting sprinkled oil, even high up on the
&gt; shroud.  How's this fixed, if it's the seal behind the pulley?  Would
&gt; cutting the case for a sand seal help keep oil in?

&gt; Speedy's a type 1 1600dp, blah blah blah.

The fact that it is a type 1 is important.  Type 1 engines do not have a
seal behind the pulley, as this is the fresh air inlet for the crankcase.
Air is drawn in here and then pulled out through the filler neck and into
the air cleaner by the intake vacuum.

Oil from behind the pulley is an indication of either a problem in the
vent system or of excessive blowby.  If an engine is very tired, blowby
will overload the sucking capability of the air cleaner vent and blow out
from the pulley.

A sand seal will not fix a blow-by problem.  It might be a good idea from
a longevity standpoint but your problem lies in rings or venting.
