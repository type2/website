Volks,
    I'm cleaning and replacing hoses and the like on my fuel injection
system ('78 Westy). I noticed that the rubber hoses on the injectors
themselves (that the metal fuel lines attach to) could stand replacing.
However, the brief inspection that I've given them doesn't indicate an easy
way to get them off or back on. Are these replaceable, or are they there
until I replace the whole injector.

   I've replaced the seals on all of them, and I'm replacing all of the
rubber fuel lines, I'd hate to leave a weak link somewhere...

Thanks!
