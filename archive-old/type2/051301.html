Hi all-
     Seeing as how I've had a few questions related to my post last week;   
and, seeing as how there appears to be more than one &quot;European Motor Works&quot;- 
I'll attempt to clear this up so no one gets unjustly flamed.
     As I stated previously- I had posted a WTB ad for a childs cot at 
thesamba_dot_com (great site!!) . A gentleman from San Bernadino CA called me and 
said he had one, also sent me a pic.  We agreed upon a price, and I sent him 
out a money order via priority mail- with delivery confirmation. 
    He called himself &quot;europeanmotorworks&quot; - because this is his Eb*y name. 
He is not to be confused with one that is apparently from the NY area.
    Anyway- a nice feature of the USPS is that you can track your priority 
maill online. I had sent it out on a wednesday- the USPS website said he got 
it saturday AM. 
    The following Thursday- I sent him an email asking him if he had sent out 
the cot- to which he replied that he did not get my money order yet.  I 
explained that he had rec'd it 5 days ago according to the USPS.  He insisted 
that he did not get it. I then went back to the USPS, and for an additional 
fee, they will track down a USPostal money order, to see if it had been 
cashed or not.  So- after paying the fee, and finding out that he had cashed 
it- that is when I posted my question to the list, wondering if anyone out 
there had dealt with him. 
      The following day, he emailed me that, yes, by golly, he had rec'd it, 
and will be sending out my cot. 
    I still haven't rec'd it yet, but I am holding off on the panic button 
for a few more days......
    Summary- it could be a simple mistake on his part, although FWIW I got 2 
emails from list members with similar problems, one guy got mismatched poles 
for his childs cot, another never got his item at all. He does have generally 
good feedback on Eb*y, though.
     I'll let you know how my item goes.......
    Sorry for the long babbling on
