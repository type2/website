Good morning listers,
(if it is a good morning witch I'm seriously starting to doubt)&lt;-- E-Or from
Winnie der Pooh.

Any way it all started about a month or so ago (I know I should have looked
at it then) but I'd hit the breaks and the bus would swerve to the left. No
weird noise, stopping distance was fine, but the break pedal always did this
weird go down about an inch then give allot of resistance for a second or
two then go down the rest of the way, not to the floor how ever.
ok cut to yesterday
Me, my baby (well, fiancé) and Jake our dog, we rollen down the street goin
someplace or other when suddenly after goin round a corner .....
cshhhhhhhhhh well that's sorta what it sounds like, not sure witch set of
wheels its coming from, goes away when I hit the breaks, the bus still
swerves to the left, brake peddle still doin it's thing, brake fluid was low
so I filed it, but now my stopping distance has increased by about 25%...:(
I'm kinnda low on cash on acounta the weddin (may, 26), and the ASE
certified mechanic at the car care joint I've got a credit card for,  said
and I quote &quot; I don't know nuten bout these old cars, and I aint got no
tools to even get in to it&quot; yup that's a quote.
I've already rebuilt the engine (summer '99 see piks at
http://www.utreccenter_dot_com/labarge/photo.htm) so this I do consider
&quot;doable&quot;,
my vw library includes : .....How To Keep Your VW Alive: John Muir, 30th
Anniversary Edition
                                         Bentley: Official Volkswagen Repair
Manual: VW 68-79 Type 2/Bus
                                         Haynes Repair Manual, 72-79 Bus
                                         Chilton's Volkswagen 1970-1981,
Repair and Tune up guide
 I just want to know:
    1.)  what special tools do I need?
    2.) where should I start?
    3.) what stupid mistakes should I not make, (besides drinking the break
fluid)
    4.) witch book should I use
    5.) any idea on price for parts
    6.) if I have to go to a shop does any one know of a good one in the
N.W. Ohio, (Toledo) area??

I would like to get this done soon, so I can make it to VW Buses 'n Boats
Bash (it'll be my first VW event)

Thanks for your help!!!
