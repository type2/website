&lt;&lt;Just a remark.


In Germany (and Holland) you will find that most people who own a (fairly)

new car have all the maintanance done by the 'official dealer'. Which means

that only factory provided or approved materials and procedures are used.

Independant workshops cater mostly for the second, third and fourthhand

vehicles. Chains like Napa, Midas etc hardly exist. Of course there are very

few mechanics, dealer or not, who still know about our beloved verhicles.&gt;&gt;

I saw lots of small VW dealers in Germany.  The dealer I rented my Westfalia 
from in Frankfurt was very small.  I could see myself taking any of my VWs to 
one of these small shops where you can meet the mechanic and you get the 
feeling of that your not being taken for a ride by a money hungry dealer.  (I 
don't know what typical hourly German VW service rates are.)

I did find that the parts and accessory prices were reasonable.  However, 
this depends more on what the current exchange rates are which were excellent 
when I was there.
