Subject: Re:to turn or not to turn

It all depends on existing wear and condition. Typically, if the diameter 
has not worn over spec and the surface is smooth and not deeply grooved, 
they can be reused as is. Sleight, rounded grooving is not a problem. Never 
turn drums (or rotors). Replace them is they are foul. If they are glazed, 
just sand them with heavy abrasive, 80 or 120 grit. Do not use metallic 
linings (or pads). Use the softer factory type materials. Know also if one 
cylinder is leaking, the whole system is contaminated and others will be a 
likely problem soon. Pull the rubber boots back and if you see any grunge 
or fluid, rebuild or replace them all. But this is only if you don't want 
to be re fixing things every few weeks/months indefinitely. The lip worn on 
the edge is not an issue. Just turn the adjusters until the shoes clear and 
then adjust them back after assembly.

&gt;ok, i was told a while ago, that you need to turn the drums when you
&gt;replace the shoes or the grooves will wear the new shoes out faster...
&gt;true? or not?
