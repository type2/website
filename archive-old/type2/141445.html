Subject: John Brown's Buses

Hi All,

I called the KOA today and they said 24 buses had registered as being with
JBB. I know I got quite a few emails from people who said they were coming. It
actually seemed like more than 24 emails. That being said if you called the
KOA and made a reservation and didn't mention JBB you will not get the 20%
discount. I know 20% is quite a bit for us poor bus folks so make sure you
call to get your discount. See you in a couple of days.

Sharon
