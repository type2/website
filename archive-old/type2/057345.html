Subject: Compression and 79 2L for sale.

First I must express my grief about the sermmons.  I
happened to stumble across this weekend doing some VW
digging.  Put my vote in for getting them on CD, or what
ever we can do to show Bob our appreciation.

I have a 79 California 2L.  I bought it several months ago
and I finally got around to getting it running. The engine
seems to run beautifuly. However, I checked the compression
and found it to be higher than expected.

I got 150, 155, 150 and 155.  I expected to see it about
135.  But I have never worked on a FI engine.  Should it be
that high, and if not what is the impact?

Steve D. says there is a server problem, so I'm not getting
and type 2 mail, so please respond to me directly.

Thanks
Brent
