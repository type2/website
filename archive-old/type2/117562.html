&gt; &gt; I read the second paragragh 6 times......every time it said that MT-1 is for
&gt; &gt; NON-SYNCHRONIZED MANUAL TRANSMISSIONS.
&gt; 
&gt; What's confusing is there are three other grades beside GL4 that are
&gt; relative to VW bus manual transmissions:
&gt; 
&gt; GL5 - known to be bad
&gt; MT-1 - known to be designed for non-synchornized transmissions
&gt; GL5/MT-1 - claimed to be compatible by members of petroleum industry

AND all of this can pretty much be ignored by the auto tranny set. the VW
auto tranny uses DEXTRON, and the final drive can use any good quality
85-90W tranny oil,  GL4-GL5-MT1 etc......

I run synthetic gear oil myself
