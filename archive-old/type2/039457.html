Subject: Tinware

Folks,
    I recently replaced the old heat exchangers in my '78 Westy with the 
earlier '72-'74 style. does anyone know where I can find the correct 
tinware pieces to fit under the cylinder heads now? The holes are in a 
different place than the old ones were. I also need the tube that goes 
through the tin from the intake fan to the heat exchanger on the right side.

   Any pointers?

Thanks!
