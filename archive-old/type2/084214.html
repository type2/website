Subject: need some air cooled vanagon help.

Hey folks...

So I've been bent over my van all afternoon, and I still haven't got it
running right, but I think I may have a lead.  I need some advice.

The van is an 82, california.   air cooled with electronic ignition.

problems are loss of power, hard starting, rough idle.

New plugs, new wires, new cap and rotor, new coil.  Fuel system is
delivering adequate fuel.

I noticed today the distributor cap seems to be kind of wobbling on top
of the distributor.  It just didn't look right.  I dove into the old
records to find the distributors history.  I found a service report that

states, &quot;RE RE distributor, disassemble weld shutter wheel&quot;

I guess something inside the thing was broken, and rather than replace
it it was &quot;welded&quot; back together.  I'm kinds new to this mechanicing
thing, and don't know a lot about distributors.  What part is the
shutter wheel?  How can I go about diagnosing distributor problems?  Is
this wobbling of the cap on the distributor normal?  It was correctly
fastened down, and the rotor was in properly.

I need your help air cooled heads!  What should I do next?

Greg.
