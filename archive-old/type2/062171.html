Subject: Tooling up for Bus Restoration

Hello All!
        We are new to the list, but less new to air-cooled vw's. Our latest 
aquisition, and a long awaited one, is a model 215 (is this right?) 
pass-through bus, 1959. It was cheap, but you get what you pay for. 
This brings me to my question. What are you thoughts on a good but 
economical welding setup to do the many things this bus needs? We, 
do have a 220 outlet in the shop, and this opens up our selection, 
but I have reservations...namely, future shops may not, so a 110v 
that will do the job is preferable. Would a $300 Sears MIG work, or 
would its speed cause frustration? Everyone's opinion is welcome.
        We hope to share our forthcoming experience with this restoration 
with everyone, and hope to be able to contribute as well. Our 
restoration skills were learned (are still being learned) on English 
cars, so we have been tried by fire. Lucas is the prince of 
darkness-inside joke. But due to our experince with vw fuel 
injection, we have come up with the corollary: Bosch is Lucas 
spelled backwards.
        Please excuse the poor humor, if you find it so.

Have Fun
Chris And Buffy
