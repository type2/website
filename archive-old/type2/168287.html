&gt; My 78 FI Bus will not start without using a starting fluid(ether).   Last
&gt; year I replaced the thermo time switch.    I want to check its condition
&gt; in case
&gt; it has gone bad.   I have   a resistance of 35 ohms cold (ice cold ) and
&gt; 70
&gt; ohms warm (over 35 C).   It seems it should have no resistance when cold
&gt; and
&gt; infinite when hot, if I understand how it is made and works.   Is a valid
&gt; way to
&gt; test it to jump the terminals of the connector to it so that ground is
&gt; sent to
&gt; the cold start valve all the time the starter is cranking the engine.   It
&gt; might be a bit rich when warm but I would think opening the throttle
&gt; should be
&gt; able to cope with additional fuel.    What do people think of trying
&gt; this.   It
&gt; might at the worst confirm a bad thermo time switch or tell me I should
&gt; look
&gt; else where, such as spark (have not tested, but as it runs after starting
&gt; I
&gt; think this is probably not the problem.   Thanks for any and all advice

It is pretty easy I found to test the TTS and CSV. Bentley does a pretty
good job of walking you through it. Do remember that I was able to get the
CSV off after removing the distributor and tested that it was fine.

Are you sure you don't have any vacuum leaks?
