Subject: Low idle

Hi All, 

Having a problem on my '77, 2.0 FI, stickshift

When I start it, the idle will drop to ~600-ish RPM's till the engine
gets warmed up good, where it climbs back to around 850-900.  It doesn't
do it all the time, but probably a good 1/3 of the time.  Can't seem to
find any vacuum leaks, though I'd suspect the S boot first. 

BTW, That S boot looks suspiciously like the boot off of a water cooled
VW (1.6,1.7,1.8,2.0L) of the early to mid-80's vintage.  Does anybody
know offhand if the WCVW boot fits?

Thanks!

Shad H.
