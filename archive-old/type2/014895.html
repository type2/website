Subject: '77 FI 2.0l into '81 Vanagon
Mime-Version: 1.0

I have an '81 Vanagon Westy that someone traded me for a '61 Beetle 
project I had.  The engine had begun making noises while the PO was 
driving, so he pulled over and called AAA to tow it home.  He thought 
he was going to fix it himself and removed the exhaust, and it sat 
untouched in his driveway until it was time for him to move &amp; he called 
me.

So, I have had it at my house now for about a month and I wanted to do 
a compression test before I tore into the engine.  I FINALLY figured out 
how to get the battery out of the damn thing (whoever designed the battery 
placement under the passenger seat should have their engineering degree 
declared null and void) and put a good battery in it to turn the engine 
over.

I was unable to get a reading of over 40 psi on the compression test 
which is probably due to the hydraulic lifters bleeding down since it has 
been sitting inactive for at least 2-3 years.  I will probably go ahead &amp; 
remove the rockers and pull the lifters out to bleed them &amp; re-install 
them to test the compression before I take the engine out to rebuild it.

Until I have the time (&amp; $$$) to rebuild the Vanagon engine, I wanted to 
go ahead and put an engine from a '77 bus I have in it.  That engine is 
complete with all the FI and has even compression at 120+ psi.

Having not dug into this project yet, I am assuming the rear engine hanger,  
the engine tin, and the oil filler to be different on these two engines.  
I think these swaps should be straight-forward, but if anyone can think 
of any problems I might encounter, I'd like to be able to plan for them.

I am guessing it will be fine to use the FI from the '77 in the Vanagon 
since I will be using the '77 engine.

Also, can anyone confirm that the stock (or aftermarket) exhaust for the 
'77 will clear the body of the Vanagon?

Thanks for any insight,

Dave

P.S.  We don't have to tell any of those folks over at VintageBus about 
      any of this, do we?  I would hate to be excommunicated from the 
      Church of Splitty for an &quot;indiscretion&quot;...  Uh, I'm just fixing it 
      up to sell it...  Yeah, that's the ticket...
