Subject: Just installed ICT 34's

I just finishied installing a set of ICT's on my 74
bus.

It was relatively easy to do (having a helper who
knows a little about dual carbs helps a bunch).

One thing we had to do was shorten the crossbar for
the linkage, it was too long. Every thig else went
together nicely, and there was hardly any tuning at
all to do to them.  I did go ahead and get the
recommended jets from John at aircooled_dot_net before I
installed them.
It runs great, very smooth, maybe just a touch less
acceleration than the progressive i had before.
They are definately worth what i paid for them.

anybody need a progressive weber set up for a type 4 ?
