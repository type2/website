&gt; the dashpot looking thing is NOT on the carb.  it is on the intake
&gt; manifold itself.  one on each manifold.  on both sides (left and
&gt; right) the *dashpot* has a vac port sticking out of it, point straight
&gt; out (pointing left on left carb...pointing right on right carb).  for
&gt; what its worth i do not have the stock smog equip, so those
&gt; connections might have something to do with that whole set-up.
&gt;
&gt; make sense??  hope this description helps all....

They are EGR valves. At the same level on the back of each manifold is a
bolted on pipe. Follow it from the left carb and it has a tee where it goes
forward thru the front upper tin and then down to the EGR filter. This is
exhaust. The balance tube also goes to the intake manifolds, but it is just
mounted to the front upper tin and has rubber elbows on each end.
