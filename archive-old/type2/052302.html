Subject: RE: [T2] and the spark plug went POP

Bill,
	I got from an old guys place awhile ago a homemade tool... He had taken a
spark plug and removed the porcelain and centre, then welded a shaft and
T-bar to the top, cut a slot through the remaining body of the plug along
the length of the threads with a hacksaw, that is across the threads. But
wait, theres more. Then (if you were doing it up into a head) he had
carefully filed the LEADING side down a bit, thus presenting an effective
cutting edge as it screwed down. I used it on an alloy head in a Toyota and
it recut a fine thread. Cheap good tool. I would try that first. Alignment
is the key to success.
