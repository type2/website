Subject: new cip1 1600 longblock 

A heartfelt thanks to all those kind and generous folk who took the time to share their knowledge and reply. Peter seems to be extremely knowledgeable re Brazilian engines, Richard and George who are always there, and especially Air Cooled John and Old Volks Ronnie, both took the time to help after I had bought the product from a competitor, something to think about when finding that price/service balance.
 
I must apologize for prematurely posting my question to the list, before unpacking the engine.
All the references to Brasil (sic) were on the outer shipping box, official VW Brazil box, logo and all.
Inside was another box containing a Mexican 1600 long block.
 
In case it will help anyone else, the answers to some of the reply questions:
Only Mexican paperwork was a small sticker on the inside box, &quot;BAA100033C....EMEDI MTOR 1.6 lts 0M9K22......00001....assembled in Mexico&quot; and a reference to Puebla.
Left case &quot;BRAZIL ....043.101.101.A....AS41&quot;
Right case was the same ex   102.A
Heads were cast MEXICO, 8 cooling fins on top.
19 cooling fins on top of cylinders.
On the bottom of the engine, both fwd left and aft left of the sump, there are what look to be very large slotted screws. I believe this means duel relief.
 
It seems I got what I thought I should be getting. 
Thanks and sorry for the premature post, hopefully the discussion generated will help others.
Denny
