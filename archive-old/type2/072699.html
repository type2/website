&gt;Power will fall off as you richen the mixture much beyond stoich.  Most

Dave,

 I could be wrong but I think its the opposite.  Everything I have read
shows that maximum power is at 12.6:1 which is on the rich side of stoich
or 14.7:1.  Optimum economy is at 15.4: 1 or on the lean side.  Check out
the diagram at the following url:
