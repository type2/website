&gt;Hi!
&gt;
&gt;My boyfriend and I just bought an orange '76 pop-top camper! This is my
&gt;first VW and camper as well, and I am in love!! We were reading &quot;How to keep
&gt;your VW Alive, for the complete idiot&quot; days before we actually bought it. It
&gt;has a newly rebuilt engine, new brakes (although they are *very* squeaky),
&gt;new ball joints, new clutch and some other new stuff!
&gt;
&gt;We are planning a trip to Utah for the holidays with our two Chihuahuas,

&quot;New&quot; brakes installed properly do not squeak. Perhaps old rotors or the
wrong pads or not cleaned and lubed properly. Casts doubt on the
skill/knowledge of whomever did this or any other work on the vehicle. Hope
you didn't end up with wanabee rotors and wizband lose leader pads. You
will have to replace them. Take a look at the brake fluid reservoir. Is it
and the fluid in it clean?? If not, more evidence of poor procedure. You
would be amazed how many times I've seen new rotors and pads installed and
the calipers/cylinder obviously not bleed, much less flushed clean. Get the
brakes right first. I would check all fasteners involved in the suspension
work and clutch to reduce/eliminate the possability of a holiday disaster.


&gt;
&gt;Also, the car came with an oil temp gauge and we want to install it. 

Confirm that the cooling system is in correct functioning order, no missing
seals, flaps and thermo functional, use the proper oil for your conditions,
check the level often until you have a sence of how much it uses, then you
will never need the guage in Utah.
