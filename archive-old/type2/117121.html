Subject: [T2] Compression test logistics

I have a question about compression test logistics... I learned long
&gt; ago that one should never remove spark plugs from a VW unless the
&gt; engine is cold, so as to reduce the chance of stripping the threads.
&gt;

The reason IMHO that there is such a problem with people stripping out plug
threads is that too often the plugs are over torqued in the first place. I
am not sure what Bentley spec for plug torque but I would bet most plugs
are in there with twice as much. They just simply don't need to be that
tight. The other big problem is when you take your car in for tires and the
mechanics install your lug nuts with an impact gun without using a torque
stick socket. You end up with 200lbs of tourqe on your lug nuts which means
that when you get a flat its a royal PITA to get the wheel off and even
worse your rotors are most likely now warped so you end up needing a brake
job... Sorry to be so on about torque but I used to work in a shop and had
a coworker who was impact wrench happy and it used to really piss me off to
hear that damn thing all day....

P.S. In retrospect now that I have a desk job I sort of miss that sound....
