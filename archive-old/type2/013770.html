Subject: Tires again 185 v. 205
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Note that the 185 or 205 is the width of the tread. 
The aspect ratio, ie 70, lets you know that the
sidewall is 70% as tall as the width.  If the aspect
is left out, as in 185R14, the aspect is implied 85%. 


I know this is nitpicky but I had trouble with those
tires numbers because I didn't understand at first. 
A 205 tells you nothing about the height.  A 205 is
not taller than a 185.  A 205 is wider.  But a
205/70/14 is about the same height as a 185/(85)/R14. 


Personally I've never like the swooshiness and
wallowing that 205's gave my busses.  However, there
are some newer 205's that have a higher load rating
and an all season/almost all terrain type pattern. 
Manufacturers are putting these on the little SUV's. 
Those are interesting to me.  I haven't checked the
load ratings so I don't know if these would work?
