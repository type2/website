Subject: RE: Deal on Boge shocks!

&gt; Sorry, Ron...
&gt; But...
&gt; I feel the change to a good gas-shock (like the KYB
&gt; Gas-adjust) is a *very* wise choice.
&gt; My '69 Westy had O.E.M. (I.E., dealer installed)
&gt; shocks when I bought it. They were 5 years old, but
&gt; still working properly at the time. I tred the KYB Gas-adjusts.
&gt; EVERY aspect of my bus's handling has improved;
&gt; cornering, wind (ok, not much, but with a bus...every
&gt; little bit counts), nose-dive when under hard-braking
&gt; (BIGGGGG PLUS, here!)....



That's why there's chocolate and vanilla.  I too like the KYB's (which I
sell for $26.95 each, a price that I think you'll find to be about the
lowest around considering that I don't &quot;pad&quot; my shipping charges the way
some VW vendors do). I have a set on the rear of my Vanagon (although I put
Boges on the front).  But I have had other customers who found the KYB's too
stiff.

Nose dive should not have been greatly improved as you say it was.  This
tends to make me think that your 5-year-old OEM shocks (if that's what they
were) were more severely worn than you think. You were replacing 5 year old
shocks with new ones.  Any quality new shock would have been an improvement
to some extent.  To compare 5 year old oil shocks to brand new gas ones is
not exactly a scientific test.

Likeyou said, the gas shocks handle better in terms of cornering and
(slightly) wind. But they do ride a bit rougher.  The oil shocks are a bit
more forgiving about all the little bumps in the road but are stock, not
performance shocks.

Which one is better?  Neither. They're different.  I have both. You pick.
The only change is that before, a stock shock cost more than a performance
one (an odd situation), whereas now (for the time being) they're cheaper.
