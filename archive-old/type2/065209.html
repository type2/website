Jon Chr. sale of early busses made me think of following:

Contact the original &quot;Mr Bubblehead&quot; in Eugene, Or- he collects/parts for
splitties as a business, has the biggest collection of VW toys (busses)
I've ever seen:     Frank &amp; Cathy Tyler
                    German Air-Cooled Specialties
                    Used Parts, Restoration, Custom, Daily Driver
                    1637 Bailey Hill Rd.
                    Eugene, OR 97402
        Ph    503-687-9187

He used to give tons of advice on the original &quot;internet&quot; BB, VW Rap/Advice
section of Auto BB, on Prodigy!  Decided to get off modem, too time consumi
ng!   Visited him last summer; I'd liken him to another John Muir......MB
