Subject: RE: Cleaning caked engine parts

When I did my rebuild, I got out a cajun cooker, a fifteen-gallon steel
washbin and a fifty-pound bag of trisodium phosphate. I boiled all the parts
for however long it took to get the crud off with the TSP, buffed them up
with a green scrubby and carb cleaner, and finished with the engine halves
in the dishwasher. Seemed to work well, although the TSP, while good at
getting the really nasty stuff off, will coat everything with a light gray
dusting that requires the scrubbies later.

However, there's nothing like boiling engine parts on your lawn with a beer
in your hand. I did some of 'em twice, just because it was fun.

Hello Everyone...

Today is a work day, yesterday I was able to remove the fan shroud, all
engine tin, etc... Now I am down to a bunch of dirty parts caked with
sludgy, caked oil. I am curious of the best way to clean these components?

Thanks!
