Subject: Valves keep tightening up

I need some advice..

Background:

1977 automatic westy, 2.0 liter, Stock Fuel Injection,
110,000 miles
History unknown except for last 3 years its been with
me.

Problem:

My Valves keep tightening up, actually just the #1
cylinder tightens to the point there is no compression
in the #1 cylinder.  Initially I thought I had a fuel
injection problem, took it to a local kansas city shop
(v-village) and they diagnosed it as above.  They
adjusted the valves and compression was over 100 in
each cylinder.  by the time I drove the vehicle home
30 miles it was performing poorly and the shop
beleives the motor needs to be rebuilt.  OUCH !  

I've always known i was on borrowed time as I haven't
known the history of this motor, but I need some
advice as to where to begin.  I'd like to rebuild the
motor myself.  All suggestions welcome.

Thanks
Bob
