&gt;&gt;&quot;Boy, talk about cheap. That's $15 for the lube, $5 for equipment financing, $5 for rent and utilities, and $5 for the mechanic and owner to share. What assholes they are to not go bankrupt so you won't call them rip offs.

And then...

&gt;I agree, they rip you off. That's there job.

So first you flame Kabayo for calling the $30 tranny-oil-change a ripoff, and when he comes back with a sound rebuttal, you agree with him?  But wait...

&gt;Go play computer games if you can't figure out reality.
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;Reletively speaking on social values lost on the masses, which is you and everyone like you that see all your problems created and founded in others, and you are without sin, a hapless victim in your own mind.

... then you resort to personal attacks.

Nice.  And I for one am getting tired of your incessant rants about the ignorant people that come into your shop.  If you were really a pro, word would get around without you constantly belittling your customers and tooting your own horn.  

I need a killfile.
