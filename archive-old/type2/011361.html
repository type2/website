&gt;But there is still a huge ugly gap on the inside of the window frames 
&gt;between thejalousie's aluminum and the steel windowframes of the bus. 
&gt;Seems to be worstalong the bottom.I wasn't present when the jalousies 
&gt;were removed from the 73, so I don't know for sure if they forgot to 
&gt;remove a peice of trim or something

You probably didn't forget/miss the trim piece so don't kick yourself.  They're 
pretty rare.  I think they were only found (originally) on the early loaf 
Westys (68 - 72 maybe?).  The trim is a grey rubber piece that fills the gap 
between the windows and the frame.
