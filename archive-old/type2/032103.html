Subject: Re: type2 Digest 26 Aug 2001 10:15:06 -0000 Issue 98


&gt;  My mechanic says I need an air flow intake something or other   ..it
&gt; mounts under/near the air filter ?? looks like a silver metal box with
&gt; an air flap on it...what does this do?? do I need it?

Sounds like the air flow meter for your fuel injected engine. They do wear
out and replacing mine solved a lot of problems for me (and allowed me to
pas CA smog, without which I ccouldn't even drive my bus legally). There
have been posts about how to open the thing up, adjust the spring inside
and do other things to nurse more life out of a fading one. As someone
else noted, they are expensive, but not so bad if ordered from The Bus
Depot. I replaced mine for about $150 and I'll get $40 of that back when I
send in the old one as a core. I think the orginal part from VW runs
several times that.

This part is the heart of your fuel injection system. It measures the
airflow going into your engine, upon which everything else about the fuel
injection process is based. Yes you need it. And if you don't know how to/
want to do the dinking around inside the unit yourself, you could easily
be dollars ahead just replacing it rather than paying someone else to try
to fix the old failing one.
