Subject: HELP! 2.0L Camshaft Question
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.OSF.3.91.990321134458.22665A-100000_at_Sherlock.SIMS.Berkeley.EDU&gt;

Hi all:

Well, I finally got around to putting one of the two Vanagon engines I'm 
rebuilding back together.  After strugging perhaps a half hour to get 
all the crankshaft bearings to seat, they finally did and it was time to 
install the cam.  (That is, after I removed the distributor and 
distributor drive shaft as the timing seemed to be off 180 degrees - 
I'll have to go back and re-read Wilson before I put the other engine 
together.)

Before installing the cam I checked for proper crank rotation and 
everthing felt fine.

I was told by AVP (Sacramento) that because I had the two cases 
align-bored I couldn't be sure that the same &quot;number&quot; (0, -1, -2, etc.) 
camshaft as was there before would necessarily produce the correct 
crank/camshaft backlash.  So I took a number (-2) and (-3) re-ground 
camshaft from AVP, hoping to get lucky.  I didn't!

Using the Wilson tests of backlash, both camshafts periodically walk out 
of their bearings when the crank is turned backwards, and neither has any 
discernible &quot;clunk&quot; when one gear is moved manually against the other.  
And when I try and rotate the crankshaft in the proper direction with 
either camshft in place, at some point the crank &quot;hangs up&quot; and doesn't 
want to turn anymore.

So, I assume the above says the gears on the camshaft are &quot;too 
big&quot; and I need to go to a smaller number, like -4 or -5?

TIA.
