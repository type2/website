&gt;Whats a flywheel system.  Sorry if this is a stupid question.

&quot;There are no stupid questions&quot; - Einstein or someone like that.

A flywheel is a way of storing energy.  You make disk out of some very
strong material, like carbon fibre in resin, and mount it in magnetic (no
actual contact) bearings in an airless chamber.  Using magnetics, (actually
a type of electric motor combined with the bearings at one end of the
centre shaft), you spin that disk up to insanly high speeds - 100,000rpm is
good.  Then, because it is in a virtually frictionless environment, you can
just leave it alone for days and it will hardly slow down at all.  Or you
can reverse the polarity on the special electric motor that you used to get
it spinning and generate power by slowing it down.

I essence you have a very efficient storage battery.  Current designs are 5
- - 10 times as efficient as the best chemical batteries, by weight.  And,
unlike nthe batteries in GM's new EV1, flywheels don't have to be replaced
every two years. The battery pack in the EV1 costs about $1800 each time.
And flywheels are not affected by temperature changes.  The range of the
EV1is only about 70 miles on a charge in Arizona, here in Canada it would
be more like 30 miles or less in the winter.

The big reason we haven't seen flywheel-electric systems in use yet is that
making the disk strong enough to spin at high enough speeds to be efficient
has been very difficult.  Supercomputers and new materials are paving the
way for durable, efficient flywheels.

If anyone wonders where I am getting all this, all you have to do is pick
up a recent issue of DISCOVER magazine or visit their website, (it's in the
YAHOO directory) - I think it was the september issue.

Of course, until these things are actually available to us I will continue
love my 1600 aircooled. :-)
