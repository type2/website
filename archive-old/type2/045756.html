+AD4-Hi folks,
+AD4-
+AD4-I am up in Canada and ventured to Canadian tire and picked up an auxiliary
power
+AD4-outlet that you attach to the dash (a cigarette lighter).  My bus does not
have
+AD4-a cigarette lighter, so I am not sure what I connect this new thing to.  I
am a
+AD4-bit of an idiot when it comes to wiring, can anyone give me some guidance.

Hi Paul

You have 2 options here. Firstly go out and buy a cig lighter socket. You
will then need to mount it on the dash. Ideally you will get a socket that
comes with a bracket to mount to the underside of the dash, but in my case I
cut a hole in the dash. If you do this make sure there is room - I was left
with a very tight fit up against the glove box liner.

The alternative is to get a small 2 pin socket with matching plug - they do
some tiny ones at RV shops. The one I've got is surface mounted just next to
the master cylinder.

Into the plug you then wire a remote cig lighter socket. This isn't really
for lighting cigarettes, but is for plugging accessories like yours into. I
use it for my phone. You'll see what I mean when you look at your RV shop.

The wiring requires you to take one wire to earth (ground) somewhere on the
car body and the other to 12V positive. You really want to take it off the
fuse box. I've got mine coming off the outlet to fuse 9. That's the top end,
and its a 30 amp fuse.

This applies to a 79 type 2.
