&gt; I don't know. If I had the money, I would buy the lot of them, fix them up
&gt; and resell them. I know my idea is old hat, but since watching the
&gt; Barrett-Jackson, I see a lot of potential in all these classic vehicles, one
&gt; must just have access to the cash to make it happen.
&gt; 
&gt; Part of me would still like to open a shop to rebuild these.

    You won't make any money...The guys who make money rebuilding cars
are the guys paid to rebuild 'em. There was an outfit some years ago called
&quot;Golden V&quot; (IIRC) that specialized in rebuilding Beetles and selling them 
with a limited warranty...Even with the VW's low prices (then) on parts the
company folded... ;-(
