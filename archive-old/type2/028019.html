&gt;Are these pipes designed to &quot;bleed&quot; off unused heat from the exchangers and
&gt;direct it out the rear of the bus?  

Brad,
  You guessed right!  I had a pair on my '79 (removed them when I replaced the flap valves with Danish ones that only had a &quot;mushroom&quot; instead of a pipe fitting).  They exited heated air when the valves are closed.
