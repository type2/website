Subject: Re: [T2] 71 bus clutch operating shaft

Most shops have it. Check CB Performance, Busted Bus, Bus Depot, Gene Berg, 
Bus Boys, etc.


&gt;      I have been a lurker on the list for about two
&gt;years. I am having trouble finding a part. It is the
&gt;forked shaft that works as a release bar for the
&gt;clutch on my 71 bus. The part number is 002 141 701A.
&gt;does anybody know someone who has this part, or shops
&gt;that have it. Thanks in advance for any help

The OEM part apparently comes in a spot welded version which broke on my 
Beetle and on a '70 Westy a friend owned. A replacement I found was solid 
welded and never has given me fits. I think you could solid weld an OEM 
type and fix what I see as a manufacturing defect.

You may or may not need to consider replacing the bushings too.
