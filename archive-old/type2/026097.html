&gt; Also, I bought my bus with westy interior (the fold down seat and cabinets),
&gt; but after I took the carpet out I found three holes on the floor that
&gt; something would click into.  I was thinking it is another row of seats, but
&gt; I'm confused.  Did they make vans with the fold down seat and another row of
&gt; seats...or must it be a custom job?  Also..there's a fold down table on the
&gt; side with no door...was that custom?

My uncle had a 74 with three rows of seats--bench in the front, a bench in
the middle that probably had a fold-down back (it's been 25 years since I
saw that Bus) and one in the back. He bought it straight off the lot.

The fold-down table is supposed to be there if it's a Westy.
