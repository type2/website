Subject: Re: [T2] Hot Wheels (brake job)

Phil,

One possibility is that the rubber flex line is collapsing  on the 
interior, trapping fluid in the cylinder and keeping the shoes the 
drum longer then is healthy.

On an aside, I once over adjusted (too tightly) the left rear brake 
on the '68. It got hot enough to bubble the paint on the rim. After a 
roadside adjustment I figured everything was cool. A few hundred 
miles later I realized that the bearing on that wheel had gone sour. 
This is not science but I suspect that the excessive heat may have 
cooked the grease and caused the bearings to fail.

Good luck.
