&gt; Hi Mike,
&gt;
&gt;     Try local pawn shops for a inexpensive &quot;C&quot; clamp type spring
compressor.
&gt; To remove the valve guide: buy an 8 mm X 1.25 tap. Tap the top of the
guide,
&gt; screw a bolt into the guide. Use a long drift, (flat on the end, not a
&gt; pointed punch) from the bottom, and drive the guide out with a hammer. The
&gt; trick here is to make sure the drift is hitting only the bolt, and not the
&gt; bottom of the guide. If you hit the bottom of the guide it will &quot;Flair&quot;
the
&gt; guide and spread the guide hole in the head, ruining it. Some heads,
having
&gt; the guides replaced several times will loosen the holes to the point where
&gt; you must use over sized &quot;OD&quot; guides. They only come in 1st and 2nd
oversize,
&gt; after that replace the head.
&gt;     Reinstall the guides by driving them in from the top. Use a bolt
again,
&gt; a 6 mm this time with at least a 1/2 inch of the threads ground off (so
the
&gt; threads don't damage the inside of the guide) the shank of the bolt. Place
a
&gt; flat washer on the bolt so the head of the bolt will sit on a flat surface
&gt; on the guide. You wont have to pound it in, just light taps should do the
&gt; trick.
&gt;     At this point you have the guides replaced. You can't just install the
&gt; new valves though, the new guides will never go back in the same place, so
&gt; the valves wont close in there seat. (they will be offset to one side or
the
&gt; other) You will need to ream the new guides for valve fit, and machine the
&gt; seats. The reamer is to size the &quot;ID&quot; of the guide to the valve so the
valve
&gt; doesn't bind and freeze up. A reamer costs less than $20.00 at any good
auto
&gt; supply house, but unless your ready to spend some big bucks on a hard seat
&gt; grinder, I would take the heads to a machine shop for the guide reaming
and
&gt; seat cutting. This is one place where you just can't cut corners.
&gt;     Good luck, I hope this helps.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Hello all,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; A quick question in the tool dept.  I am looking to replace my valves,
and
&gt; &gt; guides, where can I find a spring compressor at a good price, and what
is
&gt; &gt; needed to remove the guides?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks,
&gt; &gt; Mike
