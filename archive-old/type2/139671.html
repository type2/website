Subject: Re: [T2] Engine stand

Mark,

I have one of these and modified it for the t4 engine by cutting short two 
of the mounting studs.

Pics here   http://www.shockwaverider_dot_com/avp/picture-009.html

It was a close fit, but *very* sturdy and solid.

I did mount my heater boxes with it on the stand.  Very nice and easy to 
do when you rotate it to upside down....you can actually see how things 
fit....and get the nuts on and off with ease.

Cheers, dave

&gt; What modifications, if any, do I need to make to the stand as it comes 
&gt; from the store if I only use it to build the engine (but not add 
&gt; ancillaries or exhaust)? I would be happy if I could use it to build 
 the bottom end, but happier still if it would take me all the way 
 through bolting the heads on.
 
 Also, it makes sense to me to bolt the j-tubes to the heads before 
&gt; bolting the heads on (assuming that I won't have the luxury of a stand 
&gt; from this point on). But I have never seen this as a recommended 
&gt; procedure. Any reason why not? Does it effect the head torque?
