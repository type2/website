	Shawn,
	1) YES, you *can* start an engine with 8psi...
	2) BUT DON'T! If its really 8psi, cold, something's VERY wrong.
	3) The alternator/generator light won't go off unless the the
generator/alternator is making electricity and charging the battery, ie
engine is running.
	4) If the original sender with original wiring (?) says no oil
pressure then I'd be inclined to believe it
	5) Bet you a nickel &quot;G&quot; means &quot;GROUND&quot;, but the person who sold
you the sender ought to be able to tell you. No papers with sender OR
gauge?
	Does the dip-stick show oil? Do the obvious things, it could be
your oil pump intake is blocked or something else serious. Or it
could be you've got the wires wrong. Take your time, you really
SHOULD see the oil pressure light go out if you crank for a while.
	Bill

&gt;While turning
&gt;the engine over with the points disconnected from the coil, the oil
&gt;pressure was not comming up.  After 45 seconds of cranking gauge reads
&gt;approx. 8 PSI.  BUT, neither the gen or oil light were on.  I don't want
&gt;to start the engine without oil pressure.  The dual sender is marked &quot;G&quot;
&gt;and &quot;WK&quot;.  I'm assuming &quot;G&quot; means gauge.  I even reinstalled the factory
&gt;sender and still no lites.
