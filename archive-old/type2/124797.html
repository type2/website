Subject: Re: [T2] Windshield wiper blues

From: &quot;Casting Fool&quot; &lt;jester_at_cfnson_dot_com&gt;
&gt; I have a problem with my bus's wipers not pressing hard enough on the...

Thank you's to Karl &amp; Alan.  I bent the arm until it almost looks like a
hoop, but the blade still has a small gap between it and the windshield at
the center of the blade.  Bending the driver's side seemed to eliminate the
gap on that side, though.

Maybe I bought the wrong blades.  I didn't go to a VW-specific FLAPS, but
bought a set at Wally Mart.  Maybe the blades are too hard for the purpose?
