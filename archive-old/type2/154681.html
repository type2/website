Interesting article, although I am distressed at the inevitable &quot;hippy&quot;
connotation the Bus always evokes.  My late mother drove Busses through the
1960s to the 1980s, when she was in her youthful prime.  It was not unusual
for a real hippie to flash the peace sign at her... But she was a housewife,
mother of three, and married to a ship-shape US Navy veteran.  Hippie
indeed!

(Not to mention that today, no shiftless hippie could possibly afford the
specialist maintenance required of our beloved &quot;metal boxes&quot;...)

However, be that as it may, I am delighted to see the notoriety and take it
as affirmation of my strange selection of a hobby.  I suspect more people
thought of themselves as &quot;hippies in spirit&quot; for the fantasy of dumping it
all for the freedom to chart one's own course.  And in that aspiration, I
guess I join them.

There is nothing better on God's green earth than the VW Type II to actually
visit, see and experience God's green earth.
