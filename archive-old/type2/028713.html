Hey guys-

Thanks for all of your help thus far. I am trying to research where and how
much I can get an external propane tank for my 76 westfalia in anticipation
for a trip to Utah later this month. I checked the archives, but other than
a site in Italian, I didn't have much luck. Can someone advise? I am in
northern ca, 5 minutes away from SF, but online ordering is fine as well.


Thanks!
Cara
