Yes, the camper you mention is currently being produced jointly with Volkswagen and Winnebago. The thing is called a &quot;Rialta&quot;. It uses the Volkswagen VR6 Eurovan mechanics, attached to the rear designed by Winnebago. It is fully self contained, with a shower, toilet, etc. They are in the US$45,000 and up price range.

Hi
  I know it's not friday, but wanted to share an odd VW sighting.  Last 
evening in traffic, there was a camper across from us at a red light. The 
front part was the new Eurovan body style, but it was like a class C, the 
back 3/4 of it being a full fledge camper with dual wheels. It was probably 
20 ft or so long. Anybody else ever see one of these? Kids thought it was 
cool to see a VW camper that large.....
About time &quot;domestics&quot; have some competition in that area
FWIW
