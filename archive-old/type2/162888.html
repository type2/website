Subject: Re: [T2] Water Fuel

&gt;OK, I know that I am opening up a can of worms but a
&gt;friend and I are going to look into building both a
&gt;water fuel and air engine for a Type II.  First we
&gt;will try it on a mower and progress if it looks
&gt;hopeful.

Stan, I'd like to save you some wasted effort.
I've perused that site you mention.  The following should help.  I 
prepared it just recently for a young relative  -  a mechanic  -  who 
had claimed to be developing a water-powered car.  I care about this 
young man, so my note to him is careful; it is also straightforward. 
Please do not confuse the habitual candour of science &amp; engineering 
with rudeness.

Best wishes

Dear  .....
	 I was interested to hear of your expts.  I've been involved 
in engine developments for many y and hope the following points will 
be of use in your work.  They are no more than mainstream science, 
which you should understand clearly even if you don't like it.


It's good you had a minor explosion early on.  Hydrogen gas is 
dangerous and I trust you've taken this fact to heart.

There's no doubt that mixing hydrogen in the combustion-air intake 
will boost the power of a petrol (or diesel) engine.  Similarly, 
slapping CNG into the combustion-air of a diesel engine is well 
proven to give more power.  This is not new, nor particularly 
interesting. 

The energy to electrolyse water exceeds the energy of combustion of 
the resulting hydrogen gas.  The system you've created will work, to 
give more power; but that power originates in the electric mains, 
thru your battery charger (losing some energy along the way).  It is 
NOT equivalent to a water-powered vehicle.

A much bigger alternator (and rectifier) driven by the vehicle engine 
could be the source of the electricity for the electrolysis. 
However, this will absorb more energy than it produces.  That 
prediction is merely one application of The First Law of 
Thermodynamics, which has always proved true when tested. 

There is a logical possibility that you will demonstrate the first 
violation of that Law.  However, the chances are so slim that you are 
investing your time in a very very small probability indeed.
