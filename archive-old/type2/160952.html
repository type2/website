Subject: Re: Homemade air conditioner in a VW?

Ok, not like it is. But just imagine a more permanent system built in a
cooler that fits between the front seats using a sealed recirculating
antifreeze coolant loop  to a tighter copper coil at the back a 12v fan, and
a heat exchanger from an old refrigerator or something similar (transmission
cooler, maybe?) submerged in salted icewater to chill the antifreeze. Use a
12v  low flow inline fuel pump to recirculate the antifreeze. Use insulated
flexible hoses to connect to the fan temporarily attached to the dash or
lower windshield (magnets, suction cups, velcro?). You could even use an ice
chest with a built in drain plug attached to a hose to drain it out the door
automatically. Yes it would be a headache to keep refilling it with ice, but
you could buy a lot of ice for the cost of a REAL air conditioning system
(or even the freon to fill it up with), and with practically no strain on
your engine, or making holes in the floor. And really, why go through all
the trouble of having an air conditioner the whole year when there are only
a few days a year that windows down just won't do.

&gt; I saw this, and it really got me to scratching my head and wondering just
&gt; how feasible it is. Just modify the stuff to 12v, totally portable, use it
&gt; only when the temps get brutal. Comments?
