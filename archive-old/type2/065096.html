A short time ago on this list, the subject came up about how many 
splitty&quot;s there were in Seattle area. It's true, especially up 
around the U of W. Nothing like San Diego though , but still a high 
percentage I think. Right here in Oly (pop. aprox. 50,000), we also 
have lots of splitty's although half of them belong to Clara ;)

Last week I gave chase to a beautiful single cab (sealing wax red), 
here in town, but lost him at a stop light.

and there are new splits in town, too!   I saw a nicely redone 67 poop top
westy in the TESC F lot, and Sheneen's 66 westy that Rain &amp; I sold her when
she lived near Seattle near the Ash apartments,, but I haven't seen the red
single cab.  There is a 64 red &amp; white single cab that belongs to a guy who
has a porsche shop in Black Lake, though.
