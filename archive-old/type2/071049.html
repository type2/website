i had a 1973-412 vw same motor with air when the old belt broke it was trial 
and error just to find the right size then a whole other ballgame just to put 
it on but i did so without pulling the motor apart took about 2 hours and a 
few words call this guy here in fl.ed 727-573-2944 he does vw restorations 
and aircooled a/c systems im sure he can give you a belt number and a few 
tips on the install he did the a/c in my 69-westy hope this helps some.

all my best from clearwater fl
