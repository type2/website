&gt; In the matter of IRC, I haven't been able to get to efnet for a week from

OK, John, Ken, and anyone else interested.  Given that there is a definite
interest in having a stable chat area (I certainly used to be a chat
addict :-), and this server looks good and not too crowded (tho looking at
a school chat area during winter break is not really a fair test), sure,
let's do it.  

Specifics:

IRC server:		irc-2.mit_dot_edu
channel:		buslist
open:			obviously 24/7, but aim for 0200-0500 GMT

With the sporadic use that the type2 server used to get, be prepared to
be there waiting for another user to show up for at least 15 minutes, and
give the other user at least 5 minutes to notice you.  It would probably
be best if someone would appoint themselves &quot;anchor&quot; and hang in the room
for some scheduled period on a regular basis (like a bartender :-).  Not
me, I used to do it, but I have this list to run these days :-)  Anyone?
(Don't answer, just show up :-)

BTW, I am in the room now and will be until at least 0300 GMT (2100 EST)

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
