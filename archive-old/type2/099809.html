Subject: Friday question (was Re: [T2] Top speed)

At 07:08 PM 12/26/2002, you wrote:

&gt;I have a 78 with the 2L engine but still tend to hold it down, one thing,
&gt;around here only a couple interstates even have a speed limit over 55, and
&gt;their usually so busy and patroled by cops that it's smart to keep your
&gt;speed down anyway.

I usually drive about 62mph on the highway but occasionally go a few mph faster if the road is clear and I have a tailwind or slight downgrade.  I don't generally slow down for 55mph zones in the hope that one day I will get a speeding ticket in my bus.  Sometimes I even speed up when I see a cop.  When that day comes, I am going to frame that puppy and hang it on the wall.  It will be worth going to traffic school for the lifetime of laughs it will bring.  I don't speed in town nor do I want to receive a citation for doing so, but I think it would be amusing to get a speeding ticket on the highway in an old VW bus.  Anyone ever gotten one?  Mike &quot;Porsche-boy&quot; Gensler need not reply.  :)  Let the flames commence!
