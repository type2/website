Subject: RE: measure firing pattern on a scope?

You could try cutting the shield off the end of a length of coax for about
an inch or two, then looping the end around one of the wires.  You will need
to make sure the scope input is well protected though, I don't want to be
held responsible if you blow the front end :-O
Does anyone know how the pickup on a timing light works?

&gt; Is anyone
&gt; aware of a circuit which would couple the signal from each of 
&gt; the spark
&gt; plug wires to the scope input so that firing pulses from all 
&gt; four can be
&gt; simultaneously displayed?
