Subject: re: replies to valve gasket Q

I asked a few days ago what others did regarding valve cover gaskets when
adjusting etc. I got every response possible from:
Always change them theyre cheap to:
Never change them until they crack and who cares about a little leak.
My feeling has always been with the cork gaskets that once they are
installed and run they never seal well again.
The most interesting response had to do with getting Fel-Pro gaskets
(neoprene I think) which Im going to look for this weekend.
Thanks All.
