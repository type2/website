Subject: brake bleeding problems

hello,
I am in the process of flushing my brake fluid today and ran
into a few problems. So here is whats on my mind....
First off is there a special tool to loosen the bleed nipple?
I tried using a small crescent wrench but it keep slipping.
When I finally did get one of them loose only about a once
of fluid it seems came out. I was expecting a lot more does
that mean its clogged somewhere? It was a dark brown color.

Here is the procedure I followed, could someone tell me if
I did something wrong.
1.filled MC
2.had friend pump brakes then hold pedal down just a bit
3. connected hose to bleeder valve and put other end
   in cup with some brake fluid in it so the end was submerged.
3. loosened bleeder valve..1 turn then 2 then 2 1/2 I heard
   the some fluid rush out. One turn should do it right???
4. friend slowly depressed pedal until he felt a lot of
   resistance then stopped and held, it was not to the floor either.
5. I tightened up the bleeder valve and he let off the pedal.

Tried that about 4 times and only about 1 ounce of fluid came out.
The other rear valve would not come loose, even spray liquid wrench
on it.
Also should my buddy push down harder on the pedel or should
the fluid come out with not to much pressure?
This is my first brake fluid change :)

thanks,
