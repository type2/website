Subject: Nut Size - Alternator

OK, I cannot get to the alternator nut on my '78 to slip on a socket to 
check the actual size of the nut. Like, sometimes I need to manually turn 
the engine to do point settings and valve settings and the like.

If I have a chance to pick up a used wrench at a tools place, what size 
should I be looking for??  22mm or 21mm?

The nut will work well with a 7/8&quot; and a 22mm, and I have both.  However, 
the tool gremlin is sure to hide these wrenches on me and I don't want to 
rely on the backup crescent wrench anymore.

And since I am looking for a &quot;best value&quot; purchase next time, which wrench 
(21mm or 22mm) would find the most uses on a 68 - 79 bay?  I mean, is there 
ANY PLACE other than the alternator nut to use one of these wrenches??

TIA
