Subject: [T2] westy curtains

     Thanks to all of you who responded to my question.  I had to remove the
back curtains because I had to take the back window out to do some body
work.  I figure while I got the curtains off I will try to wash them.  They
stood up fine.  All the mildew from the leaky back window did not come out,
but they are better.  This winter I am going to pull all of them &amp; see how
clean they come out.  I may just have Jewel make me a set with the new
sewing machine I just bought her.  Thanks again.
