&gt;What a great idea! Not only FAR more comfortable, but heated to boot!
&gt;
&gt;An aquaintance bought a new Volvo, after driving the same beetle for 25 
&gt;years. She'd go out in the morning and kick on the seat heater, then go 
&gt;back inside for 10 minutes. It should help on those cold mornings when 
&gt;the heater kicks in just as you're arriving at work.

You mean you don't have to freeze your ass in the winter?!!! 

Does anyone know of models of cars that had stock seat heaters in them? I'd
like to find a used set to install in the bug.
