Subject: 66 Motor bracket

The 66 van doesn have a rear motor bracket.  Just the four nuts and bolts on to
the Transmission.  The spline on the Trani is more or less paralell to the
ground.  If you take the back bumber off and the rear skirt, you can just block
up the motor on a milk case and some shims and roll the van onto the motor.
Slick as  weasel.  Maybe a bit of wiggling and last minute shimming.   The 69
Transporter didn't have a brake booster.  the '71 did.  I don't know about the
'70.   John Jensen in Annapolis
