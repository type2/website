Subject: 79 exhaust/HX questions
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

&gt;I've got a 79 California (engine code GE) bus with the funky left heat
&gt;exchanger/U-tube oxygen sensor setup.  From Ron's post, it appears that the
&gt;funky parts are no longer available.  Can the Federal (other 49 states)
&gt;setup for the left heat exchanger/cat be substituted on my car?

Okay NOW I AM REALLY CONFUSED!!!

I was told that the Federal version WAS the California version NOT the
&quot;other 48 states/canada&quot; version!!!???

I have a new engine (so I don't know if the engine code matters) with the
original exhaust (I assume) from a federal model(model plate in driver door
says federal).  I have the crossover pipe going to a &quot;U&quot; shaped pipe on left
(with connection to EGR filter) then into Cat, then to muffler.

I was told that the federal model required more stringant emission controls
(from inspector).  The tech at RMMW stated that the fed version was made for
the strict CA emission controls, hence the cat converter.  They both stated
that the other model &quot;other 48 states/canada&quot; had looser restrictions.

I have no authoritative information on this issue.  I would really
appreciate some clarification.  Anyone on the list have more definate info?

Casey
