&gt;logic and research to figure which one went where- or look at another
&gt;one- but is was really easier to resolder the wires to the switch than
&gt;to replace the whole damn thing. Of course, then you need to fix the
&gt;CAUSE of the problem, that is make the switch tight to the column. The
&gt;design is weak and the fix for me was to shim the switch with a strip of
&gt;wet-or-dry sandpaper (320 grit) under the mounting strap.


Well this isn't fixing the actual cause per say.  What you need to look into
(at least on the '70 SC which had only blinker, not wiper on the column) is
why and how the housing is breaking allowing itself to loosen up.  The '70
switch is backed on the other side by a little pressed steel U shaped thingy
that slides into grooves in the pot metal housing and begins to cut too deep
into the housing behind it's ends.  My solution was to take a dremel with
cut off wheel, cut grooves perpendicular across the groove the U slides into
on both sides where it should have origionally stopped holding the U  flush
with the other (switch) side.  Then I peened little sections of hard steel
(piano) wire into the grooves I made to provide a new stop with much more
surface area in contact with the pot metal.  Worked like a charm.  I backed
up my peening with a little JB-Weld I had mixed for something else.
Resoldered all the wires that were loose, cleaned the switch with high proof
isopropyl alcohol (isopropyl dry gas) then relubed all the contacts.  Worked
pretty nicely after the repair save for it didn't hold on in one direction
because the little latches that lock it were too worn, but didn't cost me
anything either so all in all OK.  I've not seen the '71-'73ish switch in a
long time so I don't know if this is applicable to it or if something else
wears, but although the wet/dry is a great stop gap solution (in fact using
the mesh wet/dry drywall paper is often better, it has abrasive on both
sides, an old composite testing grip trick) I'd look carefully to see if one
can repair what is actually failing with the housing.

Of course the later switch is much superior, only thing there is an
occasional clean, relube, and return thingy (little plastic tabs)
replacement (they are still available separately from VW for under $1)
