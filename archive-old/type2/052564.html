Subject: [T2] '69 Westy Water Tank Wanted

People:

Hope things are going well with all of your buses.   I've been working on 
mine quite a bit, having finished the exterior (just need to send it to the 
paint shop), I'm now restoring the cabinets.   Unfortunately, when I was 
cleaning out the water tank, the tank cracked.   I tried a couple places on 
the net for this part, but no one seemed to have it available.   I would 
like to buy a new one if possible for cleanliness reasons, so if you know 
of a vendor that has these for sale, please let me know.   If they are not 
available new, I would love to purchase a used one.

TIA,

Jason
