Subject: Exhaust for Type 2's

HEY,

I have a 71 with a type 1 engine, and have looking for an original muffler.  
The person at the store told me he he would recommend a Beetle muffler, 
because it helps the engine breath more.  

Which will give me better performance a beetle or a bus muffler.  I did 
install the type 1 muffler, and every once in awhile I look for a beetle coming 
down the road.

Thanks,

Brian
