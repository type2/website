Subject: Re: [T2] Using tire paint on worn out floor mats

Good to know!!!

Thanks.


&gt;Forget the black die, it is a lacquer product and unless the surface it
&gt;is to be applied to is squeaky clean it WILL come off.
&gt;Whereas Tire Black can be applied to almost any surface and is bullet
&gt;proof.
&gt;I have been using this stuff for years on the rubber floor mats in Mack
&gt;trucks , as well as the tires after I've painted the wheels.
&gt;It doesn't come off----
&gt;Its available at most any of your better  body shop supply store---
