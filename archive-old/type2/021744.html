Al,

In reading your posting, and in the reference to oils, I have been
considering going to a semi sythetic oil.

I have several motorcycles, and what better a test for oil break-down
than an air cooled bike?

They fry sitting at stop lights, durring the summer month's, and usually
are run pretty hard and long, way beyond the mfg's intented design.

I have been using an oil from Specto Oil company, after reading an oil
test by Motorcycle Consumer New's, a by-monthy publication.
They have zero allegance to any manufacter, as they have no advertising,
and aren't afraid to give negative veiw's on any product they test.

Anyway, the Oils from Spectro Oli co. surpassed the rest tested (
Castrol, Bel-Ray, Mobi One, etc.) in every catagory.( shear stength,
temp break down, viscosity loss, etc.)

Anyhow, I'm going to start using this stuff in my air cooled bus, it
tested good, it seems to stand up to my abusive driving habit's while
I'm on my air cooled ( liquid cooled also) bike's, and it can't hurt
giving it a shot----anything has got to help in the engine longevity
dept.!! :&gt;)

Joel:
When replacing the oil strainer screen, be SURE not to overtighten the bolt in
its center. It's only tightened to about 7 ft-lbs and overtightening will BREAK
OFF the stud!
If the oil pressure switch is not leaking, I'd skip it. It's quite difficult to
get to on a 72 (the only year with type 4 engine and no access cover.)
Do number 2 in David Schwarze's list- put in thicker oil.
The owners' manual says 40w straight weight oil at all outside temps over 70 F.
I cannot emphasize this enough. Is it over 70 where you are? This is NOT 10w-40
nor 20w-50. Those oils all break down to their base viscosity once they have
been hot. IOW, 10w or 20w oil.
Synthetic will stand up better, but I'm not a fan. Too much money and too much
tendency to leak.
I'm quite pleased with Shell Rotella 40w truck oil recently.
