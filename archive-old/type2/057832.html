Friends.

I just got my 1973 Westy back from the shop today and a light keeps
going on. It is right below my speedometer, a little to the right. It is
yellow and has a small &quot;B&quot; on it. It has flickered for a while then it
stayed on the rest of the way. Anyone know what that is?  My generator
light is going on too.

Thanks,
Nate
