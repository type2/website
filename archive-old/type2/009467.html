    Since it's Friday AND our 27th anniversary, I thought I'd tell those
who bother to click on this post about how integral VW Westies have been to
life with the SO.  Yes, it's short.  BTW, anyone going to Westies in the
Woods next weekend at Stokes State Forest,m NJ?   I'm passing on Manassas
to go to Litchfield.

    In late 69 I got back from playing oboe/piccolo in VietNam and headed
for grad school in Syracuse; my future spouse went to Cornell.  Can't
remember when we got the 67 bug, but in late 71 we traded it in (an unwise
decision?) for $1,000 against a $4400 71 Westy with only about 2K miles on
it-  and got married in 72!  Many fond memories are associated with that
Westy- we went on our honeymoon to Fla for the opening of Disney World in
it, and went on lots of weekend jaunts all over the Northeast.  I remember
a fair amount of winter camping, using the Ebersbacher heater it came with.
Being poor, I started doing my own work at 44K, starting with cv resealing
but ended up pounding out the stub for a bad bearing- turned out to be a
nonstandard one (still can't figure out that one!!) - Rebuilt that engine
twice- some of you may remember my story of burning a valve on a Fla trip
after installing big bores and not understanding compression ratios!
Pulled the head, bought a whizz disk and another valve, and glued a piece
of whizz disk to the old valve head to even out the seat with a drill
gripping the end...got us home fine!
    After 220 K that 71 got retired to our woods in 85 when the rear axle
tube rotted through.....still want to pull its engine for the 63 we picked up.
        Ah, the dreams stay alive.............Happy bussing!
