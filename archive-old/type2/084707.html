&gt;Hey folks, does anyone know if a 74 pickup is geared lower than a 74 
&gt;bus?  I seem to have to shift the pickup much sooner than the bus and top

&gt;the pickup is so much louder?  tx!

What engine does the pickup have?  Since it was not originally sold in the 
US there is a strong possibility that it does have different ratios in the 
tranny.  Your 74 bus probably has a 4.86 ring and pinion and the pickup 
might have a 5.43 (common outside of the US).
