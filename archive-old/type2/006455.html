Will these choke heater elements fit the Brazilian Solex 30/31 carbs  sold
as replacements for Solex 30 PICT series carbs?

Also, is anyone aware of a spec sheet or technical manual for these carbs
[Brazilian Solex 30/31]?  There are enough of them in service now that some
are coming due for repair/rebuild, and none of the vendors seem to have any
information about replacement parts or interchangability with &quot;real&quot; Solex
parts.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Correct, left and right are different.
Left is part # 021 129 191E
Right is part # 021 129 192E
I don't know how you would tell the difference side-by-side if you had a
bunch of them...
I believe, for USA 72-74 buses, they are all interchangable.
For 30 + 34 Pict carbs, the heater elements are part # 113 129 191G + P.
These won't fit on 32/34's and 34 PDSIT's.  &lt;&lt;
