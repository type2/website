Subject: NC green bus w/peace symbol

I'm just wondering if the owner of the green bus in Chapel Hill with the
white peace symbol on the side is on the list.  If so, I just moved in
down the street.  I've seen your bus before at Sean's, but I just wanted
to say hi, and let you know there's another bus in the neighborhood now.
