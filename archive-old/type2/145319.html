Subject: Re: [T2] really stupid

No, it has nothing to do with the brakes.   And it doesn't sound at all like ball joints.  Definitely  suspension/chassis.  Imagine going over a bump and squeak, squeak,  squeak as the body bounces around  Annoying!  Thanks...KR

Possible causes: wheel bearings, disk brakes, ball joints. Have you 
jacked the bus up and rocked the road wheels? Does it go away when you 
brake?

&gt; When  winter came around, in the fall, I started getting terrible 
&gt; squeaking  noises from my suspension.  Sometimes it sounds like it's 
&gt; actually  coming from the dash itself but it is the suspension.  Other 
&gt; than  the main springs, what is there to squeak?  Bushings  somewhere? 
&gt;  Which ones?  If it's the springs, what to do  about it?  Something I 
&gt; can fix with PB Blaster?  I know the  door hinges need it.
