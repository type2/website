Subject: Adding wiring under bus

I am shortly going to be running some extra wires under my bus from front to
back for gauges.  Anyone who has done this before, I would like to know the
best way of doing it.  Did you run them alongside the existing conduit,
somewhere else, did you put them in their own conduit/sleeving?  Is it worth
trying to feed them down the existing conduit or would that just be a waste
of time?

Any tips gratefully received.

Dave
