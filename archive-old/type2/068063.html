Hey all,
Here we go again:

'90 Vanagon Carat, dual ac/heat, excellent condition, bed, table,
beautiful maroon, 90K miles, $10000, 703-836-1366.

'82 Vanagon, $1950, Kline Toyota -- Arlington, VA 703-522-6000.
BTW, I talked today to a guy who had seen this bus, said the brakes were
shot, 175K miles on it, not inspected, etc...He wasn't impressed.  They
were asking $2750 last week.

'78 Bus, very good condition, runs great, must sell, $1900 obo, call
Sean at 540-654-3845.
Yes, this is my bus!  Please someone buy it!!!

'74 Karmann Ghia convertible, orange, VA inspection, $7500, call
703-204-0407 after 6 pm.  

'78 Super Beetle convertible, blue with white top, runs great, looks
great, $5000, 301-698-1298.

'77 Beetle, hardtop, 300 original miles (not restored), stored 20 years,
best offer over $12,000, 412-443-5007.

'72 Super Beetle convertible, 4-speed, blue, reconditioned engine, runs
great, $2500 obo, call Rocky at 301-762-7698.

That's all this week.

Good luck to the guy who expects $12,000 for the '77, tho some sucker
will more than likely pay it.

Sean
