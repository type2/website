Subject: Re: [T2] Really dumb newbie question .. Just checking ..

&gt; According to my English T2 manual, 1600 engines were available as an
option
&gt; to the TIV engine right up to '79.

Yes, the 1600 was always available on the Bay, but with the usual upright
cooling system.  The Vanagon also used an aircooled 1600 but with a unique
cooling system that looked similar to the Type 3.  The basic engine unit was
a sustantially modified version of the Type 1, with hydraulic lifters, oil
filter, relocated oil cooler etc.  The engine was fitted until Decemeber 82
or January 83.
