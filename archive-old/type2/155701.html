Subject: The Guac goes to California, v2.0 - It's Confirmed!

I leave tomorrow afternoon. The plan is to head south on I-25 and stay the
night in Albuquerque. Leave there early the next morning and head on I-40 to
Williams, AZ,  and see the Grand Canyon and stay the night. From there it's
west to Orange County, CA.

My son is definitely coming with me. Yay!

I'm arranging a meetup in Huntington Beach on Saturday the 22nd. I'll post
details once I get there and can scope out a likely fire pit. But it'll be
on the south end near the jetties. 4pm - 10pm. I'm bringing the guacamole
and chips!
