Subject: Re: [T2] bike racks


I have this same Hollywood rack and it's worked great.  Fits late Buses
and also Vanagons.  

On a Bus the lower straps can impede access to the engine hatch but
they're easy enough to release if you need to get in there.

&gt; I picked up a Hollywood rack that holds two bikes from the local bike
&gt; shop.  There are 4 nylon straps that hold it in place against the rear
&gt; window and the bottom of the rear hatch and folds up to put away.  I
&gt; think it cost around $50 US.
