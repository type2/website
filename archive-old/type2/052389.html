&gt; &gt;&gt;   What is different about the intake manifold for a bus?

&gt; &gt;71 bus engines are a little strange and have a few one year only parts.
&gt; &gt;The generator, gen stand, pulley, front engine tin, intake manifold (end
&gt; &gt;castings at least),,,,not sure about the actual manifold, and some other
&gt; &gt;little pieces are kind of hard to find.

I had a 71 years ago and I seem to recall that the bus manifolds sat
lower, I tried to get a bus manifold in there once and it sat just high
enough that the air cleaner would hit the top of the compartment.

(but this was some years and experience ago so I may be mistaken)
