&gt;
&gt;The issue du jour is  oil pressure relief valve pistons.  Specifically,
&gt;whether one piston or both pistons should have a groove near the top.  In
&gt;two of my engines, only one piston has such a groove. In the other, neither
&gt;piston has a groove.
&gt;
&gt;On p29 of the engine section of Orange Bentley, one photo shows two
&gt;grooveless pistons and another shows a grooved piston.
&gt;
Cases with a single oil pressure relief valve use the grooved piston, cases
with oil pressure relief / oil pressure control combo use the grooveless
pistons.
