Subject: Slick 50 treatment
Message-ID: &lt;3767D067.EA9634C4_at_jps_dot_net&gt;

Hey,
        Has anyone had positive experience using Slick 50 or any of the
other teflon(or non-teflon) treatments in extending their engine's life?
I'm just about to get a 2.0 L rebuild back on the road and was
wondering, of course wanting to get the maximum mileage out of her. The
air-cooleds being such fragile beasts I thought this might be a good
idea, but have never heard it discussed regarding volksies.
