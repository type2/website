Subject: Corvairs - was Chinese type-2's

&gt;Also in interesting news:  I think it a fair statement that the Corvair was
&gt;an attempt by GM to emulate the bug, right?  Anyway, they didn't stop at
&gt;the bug.  Did you know there is an air-cooled, small van/bus thing called a
&gt;Corvair something or other?  A very bizarre vehicle indeed.

Yes, I think it was called a Greenbriar or something.  THere was a van and
pickup.
