Subject: '81 Vanagon timing woes
Message-Id: &lt;4.1.19990515171737.00a15a80_at_pop-2.iastate_dot_edu&gt;

I just installed a new (used) distributor in my '81 Vanagon (california)...
timing is specified as 5 deg ATDC at 850-950 rpm.  I can't seem to even get
it close to this range.  I've followed the instructions in Bentley on
adjusting the timing, but as I gradually approach the spec'd value my idle
speed drops drastically (idle speed adjustment is already near max).  Any
ideas or help here??
