Subject: Is that supposed to be there?

Yo,

I just bought a '65 camper from some guy and I know he did some crazy wiring job
on it because the high beam switch that was on the floor is now a toggle switch
on the dash. My question is this: On the left hand side of the section of the
dash that has the speedo on it there is a white, plastic toggle switch that
toggles up and down. Is that supposed to be there? If so what is it, what is it
for and what am I supposed to do with it? I am planning on restoring the bus and
I will be patching all the holes in the dash and need to know if that is an
original switch or if it is something else. HELP!

thanks,     
scott
