  Was the night before Christmas and all through the bus, not a creature was
stirring not even the dust.  The children where snoozing in the pop top at
last, though we feared for our lives for the youngest has gas.  The curtains
where hang on the windows with care, with hopes no one could see my wife's
sexy underwear.  When all of a sudden there arouse such a chatter.  I banged
my head on the roof and yelled &quot;what's the matter!!&quot;  My wife kept on snoozing
and my youngest just farted.  I grabbed a died flashlight and the curtains I
parted.  A what to my road weary eyes did appear, a fat man in red and a
Deluxe full of deer.  He said with a smile as he let out the clutch,&quot;The
sleigh was a drag, I sure dig this bus!&quot;.  As he rounded the corner, his left
tail light was blinking, I thought to myself Santa needs the Type 2 list for
his tinkering.  With a flash and a squeal, he vanished from site.  But his
words hang in the night air, &quot;Merry Christmas to all and be sure your
flywheels tight&quot;.
   Merry Christmas Type 2 List!!!!!
      Peace, Love, and Thanks for the endless hours of entertainment and
information!
