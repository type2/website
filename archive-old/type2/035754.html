Likely the float in the carb has sunk or the valve is jammed open. Pull the
top off the carb, remove the float then shake it. Is it full of gas? Look
at the valve needle? Is there a ring worn into it? Crud in the seat? Check
that the jets haven't gone loose. Before you start it again, fix the
flooding and change your oil, as it is probably contaminated with raw fuel
and can burn up your bearings and cam lobes and oil pump and such. Raw fuel
will also ruin your plugs in no time at all so plan to replace them too.
