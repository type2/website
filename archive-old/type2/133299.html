&gt; &gt; BTW, that pounding at start up when your lifters bleed down is a jack

&gt;
&gt; I am an engineer and I would have to disagree with you here, the hyd don't
&gt; slam against the seats the rattling is all in the lifter not on the
&gt; valves.  and to knock the seats loose you would have to be hitting them
&gt; the other way anyway so that trend probably has another cause.. I doubt
&gt; that any VW engine running normally could/would knock a seat loose.
&gt; especially if the seat has been seated properly.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the shock of the entire mass pounding sends a shockwave right to the
&gt; valve and seat. The stock seats are only installed at .0025 so it don't take
&gt; much to set you up for a failure the first time you bake a head!

but the entire mass is not pounding, the rattling is just in the lifter
itself the rest is not pounding and the spring absorbs what little gets
thru.

so who uses stock seats anymore??

&gt; (mine have heavy duty diesel engine valve seats and have all been peened
&gt; in place)
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; peening or &quot;staking&quot; gives a hot spot in the chamber and
&gt; promotes detonation..

well I have lowered my CR a little and use 89 octane gas so have no
problems with detonation...

&gt; Bob, you must have missed my huge post a couple of weeks ago about TIV head
&gt; failures.. look it up and read it.

was in the hospital then and only felt up to skimming it, will have to
pull it up and read it fully when I get a chance
