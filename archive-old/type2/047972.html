Subject: Re:[T2] choking fuel injected Westy

&lt;snip&gt;And if it's not the temp sensor, it might be the dreaded &quot;pieces of
rotten
rubber or other junk in your fuel tank obstructing the fuel flow&quot;
syndrome&lt;snip&gt;

In reference to this problem, I haven't seen anyone mention the screen in
the fuel tank outlet. It's about 2.5&quot; tall, brass I guess, fits on top of
the outlet tube. Seems to me this should prevent the above syndrome. Maybe
the injected buses don't have this screen? My 68 Westy has this screen, so
does the 66 bug project.
