hey i hear my named being mentioned! :)

&gt;keeps warning people about an allegedly very toxic substance
&gt;contained in the paint, but I didn't see any warnings on the can. It may
&gt;be wise to investigate first.

well on the generic non-heat resistant POR-15 i know that it contains
icocynates (sp?) nasty stuff man can you say &quot;carcenogenic&quot;?? ( i am sure
that there is someone on the list with more of a chemistry background that
could explain the details better). Bottom line IMHO is a _quality_
breathing apparatus is the way to go (not one of those .99 dust masks). Why
not error on the side of caution, it is your brains, lungs etc??? I can't
understand why people would wanna breathe that stuff in?? If anyone wants
the warning sheet I got with the paint gimme your snail mail and I will
send you a photocopy. Bottom line great paint for rust just use proper
breathing equip. It says on the can they advise painting it on w/ a brush
rather than spraying (makes the paint particles/molecules even finer and
more prone to breathing in I think)
