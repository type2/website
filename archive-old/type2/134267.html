Subject: Re: [T2] 2.0l cooling

Bill asked:


Working on the 82 westy looking for overheating problems. Saw the picture at
(http://www_dot_californiavan_dot_com/95altima/81westy.jpg ). Is there a seal/gasket
between the oil cooler and the warm air duct, left rear.  There was not a seal
in place when I had it apart a year ago, so I didn't even think about looking
for one (first 2.0l I opened).

Yes, #15 here:

If you can't find one locally, I have a good used one.
