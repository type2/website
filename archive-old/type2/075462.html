Subject: Re: [T2] Please help me start this old bus!

You can't fix the gas tank without removing the engine, but you will want to
do that as soon as you can. There is a lot of info in the archives on this.
I don't know if its ok to do this or not, but I would siphon out the old gas
if I were you. If there is rust (and other crud) you will need to do the
tank, but fresh gas must be better than the gas thats in there now.

In the meanwhile CHANGE ALL THE FUEL LINES! The rubber inside the cloth gets
brittle and the gas will come out and you don't know it until its too late.
If you have started it at all you will notice the cloth on the fuel lines is
wet..thats gas coming out and you'll have an engine fire! When you replace
the fuel lines (and you didn't do the tank yet) I would put a few fuel
filters in a row. Even 4 would be a good idea even if it looks funny.

I would definately change the oil too.

There are probably other precautions too, but I will let others voice their
opinion too. You can also have a buddy watch the engine as you turn it over
and it starts to run.

Good luck with the new bus!!

&gt; what's up list,
&gt;
&gt; I just purchased my first bus ('77 bay) a few days ago and I'm really
&gt; anxious to bring her back to life. The problem is she hasn't ran in half a
&gt; decade and has been sitting as a lawn decoration ever since. I was just
&gt; curious to know if there are certain things I should do to the gas tank
and
&gt; the engine (oil change, etc.) before I crank her up...any help is
&gt; grateful...
&gt; thanks,
&gt; -Aaron
