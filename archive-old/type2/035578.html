 &gt; &gt; im not sure about using &quot;the pink stuff&quot;....id be afraid of moisture
 getting
 &gt; &gt; in between the sheet metal and the insulation and rusting (the way
 carpet
 &gt; &gt; can do to floor pans)
 &gt;
 &gt; I think when I redo my 68 interior I will insulate with regular R6 or so
 &gt; but I plan on sealinf th einsulation in plastic bags. Ive seen it done
 &gt; this way in studios it also helps keep the glass fibers from getting loose
 &gt; on yyyou  (itch)
 
 The PO of my 67 Standard stuffed fiberglas insulation in every nook and
 cranny. It is a sponge! I am replacing both front doors and both cargo doors
 because the bottoms are rusted out from this stuff. DO NOT USE IT! Unless
 you can vacuum seal the plastic bags....
  &gt;&gt;
I used the shiny bubble wrap stuff from home depot.  Is warmer.   The rust 
repair in the left rocker ( yes there is more rust,  but less drafts) and 
interior panels in the front and roof probably didn't hurt either.
 
I think the sprayfoam traps moisture (bad) and the fibreglas is itchy, and 
soaks up moisture , even if you put it in a bag the plastic will degrade so a 
delayed spronge.

Anyway, I was in my garage till about 11 with a friend reassembling his 65 
bus.  This seems to be an ongoing concern, espcially as it gets  maybe a 
chunk of 4 or 5 hours once a week.   Anyway,  it had turned out that I had a 
reallly bad tire on the left front in my 65 westy (it started that thumpa 
thumpa thumpa thing)   and my spare was cruddy, so I grabbed the spare out of 
a bus in the back, and in spite of it being a 195/14 and the other 3 being 
205/14s, it drove *significantly* better AND that irritating squeak 
disappeared.  I had greased the suspension so much!!! and it turned out to be 
the tire.  So  two weeks ago we wrestled annother tire of that bus out back, 
and put the 195s on the back of my westy, and two 205s on the front.   This 
raised the MPG by about 4, I believe   From before the first tire was 
replaced.    more on that at a leter date.  So the point being that the right 
rear is having a slow leak.  So when I drove Jason home we took the bug.   Go 
out to bug, open door.  CRACK open against frost.   Crunch the other door 
opens.  insert key, started it up with foot on clutch as I leave the parking 
brake off and it in gear as I dont drive it much, dont want the brakes to 
rust stuck.   when I let off the clutch, the engine slowed.   clutch in sped 
up, clutch off, slowed. Ooh, must be the cold thick gear oil.   where's my 
ice scraper?   Got a nifty one at the cascade Kombis X mas party in the gift 
exchange, ice scraper one side, squegee the other,  in my bus.  found my 
safeway card and proceeded to scrape ice off the windows, which was difficult 
as it was so thick.   You know, the defrost vents in the splitty have such 
superior placement.
