&gt; And Scott, thanks for your comprehensive &quot;hand into the present&quot;.  But I am
&gt; still puzzled at one thing he said.  He was sad about not being able to &quot;chip&quot;
&gt; present day Porsche engines (his words and sentiment, not mine).  Does this
&gt; make sense?

Yes.  What he is saying is that current Porsche design is so close to the
physical limits of the engine that changes will only harm performance, not
improve it.

Now, I don't expect to see this admitted to by the mod chip manufacturers,
but it is certainly possible.
