 Joe Clark &lt;jclark_at_supernet_dot_net&gt; queried&gt;
&gt;This engine is a 1600SP with a 28PICT carb.  I have a spare 28PICT that
&gt;is OK, but I'll need something better when time comes to run.  Is it
&gt;worth investing in tools &amp; skills to rebush carbs (yeah, I know - it
&gt;depends - but how about for early carb owners)?  If I decide to buy a
&gt;spankin' new carb, I may not be able to get a 28.  Other recommendations
&gt;for this setup?  It's stock except the header.
Joe and list,
A better match for the 1600SP is actually a more common 30PICT-2, stock
setup on 69-70 in the US.  You can also use the universal 30-31 PICT
replacement.  My experience with my 34PICT3 was the new one was soooo much
better than the one I carefully cleaned and rebuilt.  Also with a header
exhaust you may want to increase the jet size a bit.  I wrote about that
earlier, Solex and jet should find it in the archives, or I'll fill you in
on P-mail.
