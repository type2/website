Subject: split-window trans

Thanks for all the responses to my last post (about converting a split to
disc brakes).  Here's another question for you, a really easy one:  if I
wanted a transmission for my '59 that would handle 80 to 100 hp and would be
geared high enough to hit 70 or so without deafening me (panel bus- no
furniture!), what do I get?  Would a stock trans from a later split be able
to reliably take that output?  

Thanks in advance for your kind and thoughful attention,
