A post and responses from the &quot;Type III mailing list&quot;
&lt;type3_at_vwtype3_dot_org&gt;, which I am reposting here, because it is perhaps of
interest to type 2 types too.

[Original Post:]

Hey Volks, after having lots of trouble getting my fastback to run
properly
with the FI having sat for over a year, I decided to eliminate faulty
injectors as the cause, having already checked for air leaks and wiring
problems.  I have (fortunately) a spare set of stock injectors, so I
sent
them to R.C. Engineering (http://www.rceng_dot_com) for their $24.00
test/clean/calibrate/test procedure.  I sent them FedEx on Thursday
afternoon, with instructions for them to call me when they were ready to

ship.  RC claims 24 hour turnaround (yeah, right, I'm thinking).  When I
got
home from work on Friday, RC Engineering called me and WAS ready to
ship.
Pleasantly surprised, I set it up for Saturday delivery and received
them
yesterday when I got home.  Incredible service.  What do you get?  When
RC
receives the injectors, they test them for flow rate (as received), then

they remove the plastic tip around the needle, clean the whole works
ultrasonically then rebuild the injector.  Then they test it a second
time
to verify an improvement.  According to the test chart they sent me with
the
injectors, my 4 injectors flowed an average of 337.6 cc/min (_at_43 PSI)
before
cleaning with 2.6% difference in flow between them.  Afterwards, the
injectors flowed an average of 344.8 cc/min (_at_43 PSI)with only .2%
difference in flow.  They also paint the body of the injectors (I
believe),
because they are all a nice uniform grey color.  I'm very satisfied with
the
results so far - I haven't had a chance to put them in yet because the
weather is absolutely terrible.  Cold and rainy, I think we got Toby's
weather by mistake today.  I'll let you know how they work out once I
get
them re-installed on the engine.  So far, this seems to be a good
alternative to buying new injectors, roughly half the price and much
faster
turnaround.  I plan on getting the other set (that are on the engine
now)
done as well for a spare set.  Total cost (including Saturday delivery)
was
$129.75 USD.

Actually.. this is just a waste of money!  theres nothing you cant clean

out of an injector that they can with a can of compressed air, gumout
and a
battery. you dont even need the air and battery most of the time.

Injectors are NOT rebuildable and the ones with the cinter filters you
cannot even get the filter out.  what goes wrong with injectors is the
rubber sealing O ring inside.  rust develops around it and it starts to
leak, especially in a car that sits.  there is NO fix for this and
cleaning
will not make it any better. Dumping money into old injectors is a bad
idea
cause that O ring can still go at any time.

[Second response:]

You can remove that plastic tip yourself with your fingers; there's
no trick to it. If you do that you will see that it has really gotten
you nowhere--all the important works are farther inside where you
still can't get at them.

[A] 2% difference is better than I would have expected; 0.2% strikes me
as better than the precision to which this could normally be
measured. Why 43 psi when they run at 28-30?

I have to agree with Keith. Bosch says to just pull them out still
connected to the wiring harness and the fuel line. Then, WITH THE
COIL DISCONNECTED, have someone crank the engine with the starter
while you watch the spray pattern. Bad injectors are usually obvious.

The rust around the o-rings that Keith mentioned is half right. The
other half is that Bosch apparently choose a poor material for the o-
ring so it shrinks with time and stops sealing.

I have seen companies that claimed to rebuild these injectors, but it
it is a major job. You have to machine away part of the central metal
body to remove the crimp, then pull the guts out of each end and
clean them up. Then put the parts back in a NEW body and mold a new
plastic connector end over the back end.

I have a couple of injectors that I cut open just to see how they
were made inside. It's really very interesting, and not at all
obvious.

I have seen some injectors with a different shape of plastic
connector body, I don't know if those were actually rebuilt, or just
someone else's product.

In most cases, I think what you get with a &quot;rebuilt&quot; injector is some
cleaning, a paint job, and a fresh piece of hose. I replace the hoses
myself any time I'm replacing the hoses in the engine compartment.

[Response by me, Eric Forsman:]

Well, it seems to to me that the key thing here is not the cleaning, but
the testing.  I might do a good job cleaning injectors myself.  Heck,
they might be fine as they are; but I don't know what my injectors are
doing as well as this, because I can't test them to that degree of
precision.  Now, it might be true that this is more precise than
most/anyone needs; but, I suppose this might be a good way to go if you
are building an otherwise perfectly balanced engine.  Anyway, the only
thing you waste if anything is money and their time; so if you're not
concerned about the money, then it's no problem.  Depending on your
level of wealth, it might be worth it to you just so as not to have to
mess around with spraying gasoline.  I think it depends on what you have
and what you want -- not very profound, I know.
