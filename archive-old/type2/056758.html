&gt; How can they possibly be allowed to sell it [sodium metasilicate]
under the name TSP at all? In
&gt; case you were wondering, the brand name is Red Devil, and it was
purchased
&gt; at my local Ace Hardware.

TSP is just a set of initials that can represent many different
combinations of words.  It is commonly used as a short way of saying
Tri-Sodium Phosphate, which used to be a very commonly-used cleaner.

Years ago, some sharpie figured out that he could simply use &quot;TSP&quot; as
a trademark, much as &quot;STP&quot; (hmm, same letters) &quot;WD-40&quot; and &quot;VW&quot; are
trademarks.  There's no need for him to put any specific ingredient
into his product, as the &quot;TSP&quot; doesn't really specify anything.  When
the ecologists restricted the use of phosphate-containing cleaners,
(phosphates are fertilizers that supposedly caused excessive growth of
water plants if the phosphate found its way into a
river/lake/whatever) the brand name &quot;TSP&quot; went to the phosphate-free
formula.  

The irony is that the product prominently labeled &quot;TSP&quot; isn't really
what you want.  You will probably find real tri-sodium phosphate on a
nearby shelf, usually in a plainer white bag or box.  It'll be quite a
bit cheaper, too!
