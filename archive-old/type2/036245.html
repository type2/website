Subject: Re: Know your buses and thier history.

This is also the same article that says there was 
a the first water cooled Vanagons were diesel 
wasserboxers and never even mentions the 1.9 
liter GAS wasserboxer that was introduced in 
1983.5 and used through 1985!  I bought that mag 
for that article and for the Volkswoman column, I 
know Lois, and as far as that article is 
concerned I think I wasted my money.

 &gt; &gt;I have a question: Why do people call the 73 
bus engine a 1700 when the mag. 
 &gt; &gt;indicates it is 1795cc?  If rounding is use 
then it would be more accurate  
 &gt; &gt;to call it a 1800. 
 &gt; 
 &gt; Consider the source.  Would you trust VWTrends 
magazine or the
 &gt; Robert Bentley shop manual for the correct 
information?
 &gt; 
 &gt; The Bentley manual says that engine codes CB 
and CD have a
 &gt; displacement of 1679cc.  Get a good shop 
manual, your bus will
 &gt; love you for it.  :-)
