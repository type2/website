&gt; Man oh man you don't want to accidentally ground out
&gt; any power wires connected to that circuit.  I had a 92
&gt; Jetta with the same feature.  Loved it.  Had the key
&gt; in working on my radio and grounded the red wire
&gt; (switched 12V).  Zot!  No more radio switch.  I

--&gt;  Looking at the wiring diagram for my 75 van, the buzzer switch is one
of those grounded-side switches VW likes so much.  So you'd need to put a
relay in, and power the radio off the relay.  I think I'll try that in my
van...I know someday I'm gonna leave the radio on by accident, otherwise.

How sensitive can it be, in the bus?  That circuit is spec'd for a 16 amp
fuse.  (Must be one heck of a door alarm buzzer!)  Anyway, the relay will
take the load, not the buzzer switch.
