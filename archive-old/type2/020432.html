Subject: What is it?/hazard -79 Westy

A coupla questions for you smart folk!

1)  What is this wierd little spring loaded doohickey center under my
dash?  
http://www.skanky_dot_org/bus/wonder/MVC-111F.JPG
Just wondering...

2)  My new hazard switch has one more terminal than the old...  Pics of
old and new here:

http://www.skanky_dot_org/bus/wonder/hazard.jpg

The old switch has a resistor that Haynes sez: &quot;resistance which dims
the fascia warning light when the main lights are switched on.  When the
emergency signal is operated the warning light is bright.&quot;

So, no resistor, and nothing to attach to that lug.  Consequences?  No
glow on the switch?

3)  I found a little spring, slightly smaller than a std ballpoint pen
spring on the floor today after wrassling with this stuff.  Uh, could
this be important?  I've tried very hard not to be bruteful, and as far
as I can tell have not knocked anything else loose, but...

4)  I am SO hating this.  I've finally managed to get all but one of the
bundle of wires hanging down enough underneath to slide the connectors
on, but there is one wire still up in the dash (goes on the bare lug you
see upper right in the photo of the new switch) that is NO WAY gonna go
on unless I can pull the instrument panel out enuf to allow my chubby
little hands in there.  I can reach up inside and touch the speedo nut,
but not enuf leverage or room to move it.  GAR!  

Now would be the time for some encouraging words.  I'm going to burn in
hell for my language on this job if Muir is sitting in judgement.  With
love, my ass.  

With a fever, with a cough, a splitting headache, with little razor like
cuts from the sharp edges, with the occasional primal scream, with a few
days to go before my 30 days to get title transferred or have CA DMV
take yet ANOTHER couple pounds of flesh (out of state title currently,
so I have to take her down to the REAL DMV, $#_at_!), all of those, but NO
LOVE.  Nope, this is hell.  Snivel, snivel.

Thanks for listening,

Teri
