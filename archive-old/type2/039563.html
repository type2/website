&gt; Not trying to be a party pooper here, but I do remember hearing one

&gt; travel.  Since I do a lot of driving in my bus on rutted, rocky dirt roads 
&gt; in remote places, I decided against the kit for this reason.  For those 
&gt; that never venture off of paved streets though, this shouldn't be a concern.

A valid point, particularly since buses lack the pronounced rearward
weight bias that makes the bug such a good car off-road.  The suspension
has to be kept very flexible to keep enough weight on both rear wheels to
prevent spinning.  Otherwise, you dig a hole! :(
