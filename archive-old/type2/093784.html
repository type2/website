Subject: Re: [T2]  Using SAE30 in 2.0 FI with Hydraulic lifters...

According to VW's chart the SAE 30 is almost equivalent to the 20W50.  
The heat prob is suspect is not related to your oil but rather something 
preventing proper cooling.  What have temps been i AZ?  If your ambient 
temp is already high and you are carrying a load you might be at max and 
have to take cool down breaks.

&gt; I've been using 20-50 in my 77 with good results however, I just 
&gt; arrived in
&gt; Tucson AZ a few days ago and despite driving through the night from San
&gt; Diego, the bus was just getting too hot to run over 52-53 mph. I'm 
&gt; planning
&gt; on driving all the way to the east coast and would like to run at about
&gt; 60mph if I can keep the oil temp down. A local in Tucson recommended 
&gt; running
&gt; straight 30. Would running this heavy of an oil be bad for the Hydraulic
&gt; lifters?
