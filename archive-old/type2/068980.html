Subject: Brake shoes for &quot;71&quot; camper

I have found that when a FLAPS guy asks me for the chassis number or year
of my van for brake parts I am about to get poor quality parts.  I have
also found that getting the very best parts, particularly the front pads
(oops, I guess on a '71 you are looking at shoes up there), always pays
off.  I suggest you go to a place where the parts are expensive and they
don't ask you for the exact date of manufacture for your van.  It has
always worked for me.
