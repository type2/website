&gt; Hi all,
&gt;   Anyone out there (CON U.S.) have any info on importing
&gt; a new Mexican bus?
&gt; Like can you do it?

Daniel,

Generally the answer to this question is no, as they, as with the
beetles being produced there, do not meet current safety standards. 
However, there are ways around these laws. Unlike the beetles one
cannot remove the body of a bus, and mount it on an older frame, so
that method is out of the question.  The best way is to register the
vehicle to an address in Mexico, and get mexican plates.  Then after a
certain amount of miles are accumulated on the vehicle, I don't know
what the majic number is, the vehicle is then considered used, and you
can then register it in the US.  Obvious drawback is that you need an
address in Mexico.  No post office boxes.  The other option is to get
one of the companies that advertise in VWT&amp;A or some such mag, that
claim to import beetles from Mexico, and resell them in the US, and
ask them to bring in a bus for you.  Problem with that is you pay
almost double what one costs in Mexico for their effort.

If you find a way to do it, using my suggestions, or some other
suggestion, let me know, as I may be interested.

Cheers,

David
