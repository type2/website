front page of the website.  I've had trouble  finding stuff myself but it
must have been because I was down too many  layers to find what I was
looking for.   Thanks for the  info.  I'm sure I've bought something
&gt; elsewhere that you had that  I just didn't find.  Cheers....KR

I just want a big button that says:

--------------------
| Show me the item |
| I'm thinking of! |
--------------------

Admittedly, this would probably requrire a bit more parsing from the site
software, but it would greatly ease my ordering problems...  :)
