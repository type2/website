Subject: RE:  Manifold boots for Dual Port

&gt;Does anyone know of a manufacturer of intake manifold boots 
&gt;that can take the heat and gasoline exposure?  I think that I 
&gt;had better luck the time that I wrapped the connections with 
&gt;inner-tube rubber!

I fixed up a bug for a kid out in Po-dunk, NM a few years ago.  Not a VW
supplier for 300 miles!  Went to the FLAPS and asked Billy Bob behind
the counter for a radiator hose with the same size ID as the thing I had
in my hand (an intake boot!).  He came back with a hose the right size.
I sliced 4 pieces off of it and slipped worked them on.  Perfect fit,
cheap, available anywhere, and the rubber should be very durable.  Just
a thought.
