Subject: Re: [T2] Clicking sound up front when applying brakes

Anton - Check your front wheel bearings first. Once I
had an itermittent clicking sound from the speedometer
cable only while braking. Could be a crud build-up on
the rotor that contacts the splash shield when
braking, or something else on the rotor, or even a
loose caliper, but everything should stay relatively
aligned in all situations if your wheel bearings are
good. -BaH 

&gt; Hey Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; I have a 1974 High Top that is in most excellent
&gt; shape, but has some  
&gt; idiosyncrasies.
&gt; 
&gt; The main one I am concerned about is the clicking up
&gt; front I hear  
&gt; when applying the brakes. It seems to be coming from
&gt; almost directly  
&gt; below the shifter.
&gt; 
&gt; Any thoughts?
