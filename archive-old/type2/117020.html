Subject: RE: [T2] WTF?   Japanese site

i looked up these little vans before and they also sell electric ones,
wouldn't those be about like the GM Gem as far as registration goes and be
much less restrictive in titling in the US.   the ones i saw hadn't been
modified yet though but i don't think it woudl be any different to get the
vw modded ones.

&gt; Has anyone done the yen to US dollar conversion to see how much these

One of the pages showed some prices of the &quot;&quot; vehicles.

The 1995 model shown is 880000Y, about 7600 USD.
One of the 1997 models is 1250000Y, about 11000 USD.

Of course, it would cost a lot more then that if you bought one, shipped
it over, and tried to get it past customs.  Unless, perhaps, you're a
diplomat from a country where these are street legal...:)
