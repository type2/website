Dear Steven,

Could you post this message to the type2 list, please?

Subject: Mid-70s Bus stuff in WI: $1200(?)

I was a subscriber of the type2 list for several years until late November
of this past year, when I was seriously burned while working on our 78 Bus,
Guac. I was attempting to repair a gas leak when the gasoline ignited. Guac
was destroyed, and our garage as well. Fortunately, we have good insurance,
and after about a month in the hospital and successful skin grafts on my
right hand, arm, and shoulder, I am doing much better.

We have decided to move to a lower-maintenance vehicle. As a result, I am
looking to sell what I have of VW stuff, which includes:

-a 78 camper that was also damaged in the fire (the front section). It
includes a relatively intact camping section, and a brand-new, not even
broken-in engine (it used to be Len Alcamo's). The FI has been replaced by
a Weber. It also has a BA-6 (I don't know if it works or not), intact
tranny and front beam. It's not restorable, but would be an excellent parts
bus.

-In addition to the engine in the 78 (see above), we have two working
engines: one from a 74 that needs valve work in #3, and a fully working
engine from a 77.

-some FI parts from the 77

-some parts from a BA-6 in Guac (it wasn't working when I removed it, but
the parts might be useful)

-black back and middle seats from a 74, both in pretty good shape

-some new parts not yet installed (seat pads, cables, etc.)

-miscellaneous parts and stuff (Bentley, taillight assembly, lenses, etc.
from 74, 77)

We live in a small city in east-central Wisconsin, about an hour
north-north-west of Milwaukee.

Ideally for me, someone who had storage space would buy this stuff as a
whole. We could load up the camper with the parts, and you could tow it
away, kit and kaboodle.

I'm not really interested in selling the stuff piecemeal, as I don't have
the time to deal with that.

We're going to get rid of this stuff one way or another. I'd prefer that it
go to someone who is going to use it.

We'd like to get somewhere in the neighboorhood of $1200 for the whole
thing, but that's negotiable. The new engine is worth more than that alone.

Please p-mail me (dschimpf_at_fdldotnet_dot_com) for more information, as I no
longer subscribe to the list. We'd like to have this settled ASAP.

Thanks for your interest and the discussion and advice over the years,

David Schimpf
