Subject: Re: [T2] what a &quot;Swell Guy&quot;


tranny decided to crash (78 auto tranny) decided long labor day weekend
was the time I was going to do it...based on past history it takes me a
good 3 days to swap out a tranny...Barry (a Sweel guy) said I'm going to
be in the area why don't I stop by and give you a hand,,,,,a lot more than
a hand, probably knocked a full day off the job in just 6 hours of help...

THANKS Barry and this is what the busma is all about....I owe you one,
heck two or three...
