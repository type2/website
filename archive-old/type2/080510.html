Subject: Re: [T2] Marvel Mystery Oil (was oil additive advise)

Oh George, you are breaking the myth. Now you will probably tell me there is
no Santa Claus. ;^)

&gt; MMO is really just a solvent mixed with oil.  The solvent can be good for
&gt; things like stuck lifters, but you have to balance that with its possible
&gt; negative effects on other parts of an engine.  It will loosen sludge from
&gt; engine surfaces just as well as it cleans it from the lifters, so unless
&gt; you change the oil filter promptly it can cause big problems.
&gt;
&gt; I don't know why MMO has escaped &quot;snake oil&quot; reputation, but for some
&gt; reason it is now a mainstream product.  It has a purpose, but it isn't
&gt; magic by any means!

&gt; &gt; Seems like paint thinner was $2 a gallon last I bought some at Home
Depot. Should
&gt; &gt; I add a pint sortly before changing my oil? (gotta get my 40w out any
day now!)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am not sure what is in it but I was introduced to Marvel Mystery
Oil in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1965. Since this product is still in business they gotta be doing
something
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; correct.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I found the MSDS for Marvel Mystery Oil. MMO contains:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; * at least 35 percent &quot;heavy solvent-refined mineral oil&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; * at least 35 percent &quot;heavy solvent-dewaxed mineral oil&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; * and no more than 30 percent Stoddard Solvent (mineral spirits)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; That's all they listed. Motor oil with parts cleaner in it. Helluva
concept,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and one that works extremely well.
