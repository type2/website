OK, it must still be Friday i some parts of the world.

It's a fact. Gas for my type-2 bus now costs just over $4 per gallon. Over
the last 2 months gas prices have been raised on 12 occasions. Strangely
enough diesel has not increased. The oil companies here blame it on a very
high demand for gas in the US. Thanks guys .... ;-)
