Subject: Voting and 77 shock mt. repl.Q

(Notice:first three paragraphs are NON bus-related.Ignore if upset w/democracy)
Wowee gang,
        I understand the extreme animosity at the twisted excuse for a
quazi-democracy which many express.  I too find little constructive point
at wiggling my little wet noodle of a vote in the direction of the
perceived least-damaging candidate, in my pathetic vision of all the
collective wet noodles from across the nation developing a sustaining
breeze and ultimately the proverbial winds of change.
        Realistically I am not even permitted the tangible noodle with
which to whip at the smug election posters.  The only satisfaction I've
been able muster about the whole thing is that I get to vote against the
candidate I approve of the least.  Even in this light, surely the most
jaded of us will admit SOME satisfaction, yes?  &quot;Democracy: wag it or eat
it.&quot;
        Rhetorical scenario:  If you could travel back to the 1980 election
year and (after investing everything you had in Apple stock) had an
opportunity to place a vote when you hadn't previously voted at all, would
you?  My old roomate in college voted for Reagan just because he didn't
want to &quot;lose&quot;.  I consider that the only good reason I've ever heard NOT
to vote, and the best reason for me TO.  Anyway, Zappa's got St. Pete's old
job, and frankly I'd do what the man says.
        As for the shock mounting prob.: the damn nut which the top of the
rear shock absorber mounts to broke off.  Apparently the normally-welded
fixed nut just pulled away after years of stress'n'strain'n'shock'n'rot.
It's in an incredibly difficult to reach little spot in the center of a
square support and still fused to the old bolt!  I think I can cut the old
bolt off and pull the nut out from the inside.  But how should I approach
the problem of providing a new mount for the shock?  I doubt if I can get
hardware as long as that old bolt threaded from the inside.  Any
suggestions would be appreciated.  This is fairly boring stuff and if
people would rather email direct, so cool.
