&gt; Interesting to note that when &quot;switching&quot; CV's. more is required than
&gt; simply flipping the the axle end for end.  You actually need to pull off
&gt; the CV and flip it over and then install it back where it came from.  Then
&gt; you will be loading it in the other direction.

No, what you need to do is swap the axles side for side.  Put the left on
the right and vice versa.  You _don't_ have to remove the CVs from the
axle.

think of the rightmost CV. Looking from the axle side, the torque of the
axle on the CV has to be counterclockwise to turn the wheel
counterclockwise. The
torque on the leftmost SV has to be clockwise to turn that wheel
clockwise.  The same logic applies to the other CVs as well.
