Subject: RE: [T2] re-upholstering the front seats on a 1970: seven observations


[...]

Just like to add that re-upholstering with the seat in the sun makes
it easy.  That's what TMI says to do and there right.  Vinyl is a lot
easier to work with when it's warm.  I did the passenger seat in my
71  last weekend. Used TMI kits with the fiber pads.  Spread an old
blanket on the lawn and went to work.  As I worked I positioned the
seat in the sun to keep it warm.  The vinyl streched easily over the
sharp tabs. This didn't happen when previously I tried it in my
basement.

I think that it would have been a little easier if I did the back
first and then the seat.

&gt;
&gt;Greetings folks:
&gt;
&gt;It took awhile--until the springs were poking  through the remains 
&gt;of the 
&gt;original padding, through the remains of the upholstery, through the 
&gt;seat 
&gt;cover, and nearly through my backside--but I finally broke down and 
&gt;ordered 
&gt;the TMI seat covers and foam padding so I could reupholster the 
&gt;driver's 
&gt;seat on my 1970 walk-through.  Here are some heretofore-undocumented 
&gt;findings:
&gt;
&gt;First and foremost, congratulations, thanks, and good wishes to 
&gt;Caspar de 
&gt;Lint, whose &quot;seat padding replacement (driver's seat 68-74)&quot; in the 
&gt;Type2_dot_com archives was a great help.  You suffered, Caspar, so that 
&gt;others 
&gt;might not suffer.
&gt;
&gt;Second, TMI included a one-sheet instruction set that bore no 
&gt;earthly 
&gt;resemblance to anything I saw when I removed the seat or examined 
&gt;the new 
&gt;covers and padding. Its list of needed tools is, in hindsight, 
&gt;astonishing--I only needed decent needle-nosed pliers and a wire 
&gt;cutter.   
&gt;My advice is to download Caspar's advice; throw yourself at TMI's 
&gt;documentary mercy at your own risk. But I have no objections at all 
&gt;to the 
&gt;TMI covers, the padding, or the workmanship.
&gt;
&gt;Third, I took it as a given that I would need hog rings, so I bought 
&gt;a set.  
&gt;Didn't need them at all; every little 31-year-old sharp triangular 
&gt;tab, on 
&gt;which you spike the upholstery fabric to hold it in place, was in 
&gt;good shape 
&gt;and didn't break off during removal/ reinstallation.  Go figure. But 
&gt;I 
&gt;couldn't have known that until I got the upholstery off, so buying 
&gt;the hog 
&gt;rings anyway was the right thing to do. I only needed a second set 
&gt;of hands 
&gt;once, when I had to pull the bottom edges of the seat back cover 
&gt;into place 
&gt;and impale them on the sharp tabs. George Lyle recommended drilling 
&gt;out the 
&gt;rivets that hold the seat back to the seat itself so you can handle 
&gt;them 
&gt;separately, and I have to say, if you have a good way to do it, I 
&gt;think that 
&gt;George's way would make the process faster, less painful, and more 
&gt;accurate. 
&gt;But you can do it the hard way and live to tell about it. That's all 
&gt;I'm 
&gt;saying.
&gt;
&gt;Fourth, I didn't take it as a given that I would have lots of broken 
&gt;springs, but in fact I had four: one on each side at the front 
&gt;corner, and 
&gt;one behind each shoulder, linking the front to the back. The latter 
&gt;springs 
&gt;had already broken and been fixed sometime in the checkered past of 
&gt;my bus: 
&gt;broken ends of the s-shaped springs were overlapped and stiff metal 
&gt;braces 
&gt;were crimped over it to hold it in place. I couldn't find stiff 
&gt;metal 
&gt;crimps, but a generous and challenge-loving friend offered to braze 
&gt;them. 
&gt;Not easy to do on tempered metal, and I imagine some day they'll 
&gt;give again, 
&gt;but it's a start. My friend also brazed the top piece of the frame, 
&gt;which 
&gt;was the much worse for wear and tear over the years where it joined 
&gt;to the 
&gt;side upright braces.  The metallurgical purists on this list are 
&gt;probably 
&gt;hyperventillating right now. I'm sorry. Anyway, heads up to anyone 
&gt;contemplating reupholstering an old seat: you may have broken spring 
&gt;or 
&gt;frame issues you didn't see coming until you got the seat apart.
&gt;
&gt;Fifth, you can do this the hard way, but I strongly recommend taking 
&gt;the 
&gt;time to find the right workspace: There isn't a single 
&gt;lay-down-flat-and-smooth surface on the seat; and so a good work 
&gt;surface, 
&gt;not too high because you have to flip and turn the seat all 
&gt;different 
&gt;directions as you work on it, will be a big help. You can't get the 
&gt;covers 
&gt;on unless you can compress the springs and padding first, and having 
&gt;it well 
&gt;positioned is a big help there.
&gt;
&gt;Sixth, the original padding inside a seat, left to age and funkify 
&gt;for 30+ 
&gt;years, is a mess.  Have a good shop vacuum handy.
&gt;
&gt;Seventh--and oh, aren't the seasoned vets on the list going to 
&gt;chuckle over 
&gt;this one--remember that the covers for the driver's seat and the 
&gt;passenger's 
&gt;seat aren't built the same. TMI sells the front seat covers for a 
&gt;walk-through as a set, even if you only have one seat to re-cover. 
&gt;[They 
&gt;sell pads one seat at a time.]  The covers are cut differently, 
&gt;passenger's 
&gt;side  versus driver's side.  I lucked out and grabbed the right one, 
&gt;but I 
&gt;didn't check first, and if I hadn't grabbed lucky, I'd have wasted a 
&gt;lot of 
&gt;time and trouble--and maybe the covers themselves--before I 
&gt;discovered  my 
&gt;error.
&gt;
&gt;Now my seat looks very snazzy [so nice it makes the others look sort 
&gt;of 
&gt;grubby, which is now a problem], it's very comfortable [I lubricated 
&gt;the 
&gt;tracks and adjustment mechanisms under the seat while I had it out], 
&gt;and my 
&gt;bus even has that 'new car smell'--sort of.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks to all.
