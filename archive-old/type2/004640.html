A neighbor of mine has a late '70s Westfalia poptop, with the stove built in
on the driver's side wall.

He uses a bulk propane tank that he sets on the ground outside the bus, and
connects to an extension hose from the stove via a port in the side of the
bus.  Appears to work out just fine.

&gt;&gt;  so, how do you rig up a standard stove in a westy to a colman bottle of
propane?  this seems like a better alternative than getting an underbelly
tank.  &lt;&lt;
