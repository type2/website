Subject: Re: Is that supposed to be there?

I was wondering what that switch was for! I hooked my high beams up to it
when I had a three way toggle switch for blinkers (don't ask). I believe
the juice for that switch comes from the the same fuse as the high beams,
so it seemed like a good idea. Now that I have the correct blinker switch,
I will (someday) go back when I have a couple of free days and rewire
everything appropriately.

BTW, the other features of the turbo-thrust option include a JATO rocket on
the poptop (Westy only option). This came with the spare tire mounted on
the front to cushion the impact. Nowadays, most people have removed the
JATO unit, leaving only the spare tire on the front. Are there any NOS JATO
rockets out there?
