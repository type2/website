No joke!

You lost me on that example, although I do only have a textual mail
program.

If 0/TDC are lined up with the case seam, and the engine turns clockwise,
then anything to the right of the case seam is BTDC because it reached the
seam before TDC did.  Anything to the left of the case seam is ATDC
because it reaches the case seam after TDC does.

Also, check Muir, Bentley and Haynes for clarification and proof of the
timing mark positioning/setting.  All those books are in agreement, which
agrees with the above...

Cheers,

Tom
