Subject: Re: [Re: Type4 vs Type1 (longish)]

i carried my type4 (without jugs and heads though) across the parking lot (i 
park way out there too) and up to my third story barracks room.
of course, this tore up my knees pretty bad, (no running, no prolonged 
standing, hurt to even cross my legs) for about 4 months (well, it was 
something like a month and a half before i finally went to see a doctor, and 
a month or so of physical therapy afterwards). my advice to anyone: get 
someone else to help you carry the friggin' thing!!! especially when you 
carry it up to a third story room :)

&gt;You're right dave - sorry.
&gt;Quoting Tom Wilson from page 30:
&gt;&quot;If lifting a Type4 engine be prepared for a heavy load; it weighs about 
&gt;twice
&gt;as much as a Type1.  Thats about 300lbs for a Type4.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;Hats off to you moving 300 lbs from the floor to the bench - i won't be
&gt;putting my back through that, nor will i be arm-wrestling you. :D
&gt;
&gt;So i stand corrected - a tunrkey Type4 weighs about 150lbs more than a 
&gt;Type1.

&gt; &gt; Ummm... I have to disagree with this one.  :)  A complete type IV motor
&gt; &gt; with exhaust, intake, etc would be lucky to weigh 300 lbs.  I can lift 
&gt;the
&gt; &gt; long block up onto my workbench by myself.  I think the difference is
&gt; &gt; closer to 100-150 lbs.
