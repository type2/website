Subject: Re: 1979 Kombi sunroof M-codes

&gt; I had a look and here are the codes.
&gt; 92 119 491
&gt; 508 560
&gt; 0909NP D02 D27 227 246
&gt; 14 4 7454 UA 2313 61

I propose two little corrections, let me know if I am
right on this:

'0909NP' is 'D9D9NP' I suspect and
'D27' is '027'

In that case the plate would read as follows:

&gt; 92 119 491
&gt; 508 560
&gt; D9D9NP D02 027 227 246
&gt; 14 4 7454 UA 2313 61

Here's the translation:

****** 1st line ******
92 119 491 = chassisnumber
             9: modelyear 1979
             2: this is an extra number that was
                used to distinguish 1970ties and
                1960ties chassisnumbers. The '2'
                would turn into a '3' as soon as
                1 milion vehicles of this model
                had been produced. This never
                happened with the Transporter
                production.

             119491: the serialnumber.


****** 2nd line ******
508 = Mcode: Sliding window in side panel
             opposite the sliding door
560 = Mcode: Steel sliding roof 


****** 3rd line ******
D9D9NP = paint- and interiorcode
         D9: paintcolour lower half -
               'mexico beige LE1M'
         D9: paintcolour upper half -
               'mexico beige LE1M'
         NP: doorpanels and seats -
               material: leatherette
               colour:   canyon brown

D02 = Mcode: this code stands for a groups of Mcodes
             Unfortunately I don't know exactly which
             M-codes. It has to do with things
             standard for the US market such as:
             - USA electrical system
             - USA seat belts
             - odometer in miles
             - exhaust emission control
             - padded dashboard
             - backup lamps
             - rear window defroster
             - ...
027 = Mcode: plate for emissionsvalue and engine
             with catlyst for unleaded petrol
227 = Mcode: Detachable headrests for all seats
             in cabin
246 = Mcode: ??? unknown ??? 


****** 4th line ******
14 4 = this code is a date. This date is mostly
       a few days later than the actual
       production date.

       week 14, day 4 (=thursday), 1979

       5ht of April, 1979

7454 = code related to production planning

UA = destinationcode: USA, Los Angeles

2313 = 23: VW Kombi (delivery van with windows)
       1:  LHD, slidingdoor right
       3:  with M015 (3 seater middle bench seat
           in cargo compartment)

61 = 6: 2000cc Fuel Injection engine
     1: manual 4-speed gearbox

-- end of translation --

Thanks for letting me know the codes of your van. I am
just curious what these vehicles looked like in the
USA. There aren't many late bay Kombi's around except
for campmobiles. I was surprised to find Mexico Beige
on your bus. I don't think it was available over here
for a regular VW Kombi.

M246 I have seen before on 1977-1979 USA baywindows. I
have no idea what it means. One of the ways to find it
out is if someone still has the 'Montageanweisung'
with their bus. This is a rare print-out made in the
factory explaining which things should be mounted on
that particular vehicle. If you happen to have such a
print-out with the original documents of your van let
me know!

If anyone else on the list want to have their plate
translated just send me a personal message:

yours,


Vincent
