Hi Beth,

Depending on how law-abiding and environmentally-friendly you want to be, 
you can do what I did to pass Colorado emissions.

When I took my 79 Westy in for a retest (first-time failure), I unscrewed 
the mixture screw (leaner) about 15 or 20 turns to get the CO levels as low 
as possible.  I did this down the street from the testing garage, so I 
didn't drive very far on a very lean mixture.  I passed (though the tester 
was surprised to see such a clean-running Bus), and was about to turn the 
mixture screw back the 15 or 20 turns, but the mechanic offered to let me 
use his diagnostic machine for a few extra bucks.  With that, I was able to 
set the mixture exactly (1.25% CO), and even managed to keep it within the 
correct emissions specs.  If your testing mechanic isn't as nice, just turn 
the screw back to where it was and try to forget about the extra 
hydrocarbons.

Good luck,

Jason Upper
