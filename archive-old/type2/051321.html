Subject: [T2] Sad, and funny story

		Well, I am working 12 hour shifts here at the base due to an
exercise and so I meet my wife at our Church to baby sit in the nursery like
we always do on Wed nights. Anyway, one the way home we were in two cars. I
was in my 71 Bus and she was in front of me in her 2000 Camry. Well as we
were pulling on to Pacific Ave. in Parkland, a Police car was coming a Mach
speed lights blazing. So I turned the wheel to get over to the side and
looked over my shoulder to see where it was at when I smashed into the back
of my wives car. I guess she stopped and I did not see her. We all were OK,
I was going kind of slow, but the two cars do not look so good. The Camry
needs a new trunk and bumper cover, and the Bus, well it needs help. I have
a spare tire rack on the front that bolts to the bumper(got it from Brian T)
and had my tire mounted hub cap out. That tire really left its mark on the
Toyota, but caved in the nose of the Bus. It also destroyed my front bumper.
It's a good thing the nose on the bus had been hit several times by the PO,
or I would really be upset. 
		So, I am still looking for a late 70's Westy (or 80's) at a
decent price, but I may be parting out my 71 SO-69.
