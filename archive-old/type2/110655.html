&gt; I don't know what a Geo weighs but its definitely way
&gt; lighter that a couple trips I've done. First let me say
&gt; that what I did was not necessarily smart.
to say the least....I remember my friend towing one bus up
from Santa Rosa up the coast to Gualala.....the towbar
broke as he turned up the coast on hwy 1! the second bus
tried to jump down 100' to the russian river and take the
bus he was driving with it!  ;-0
.....and other stories I have heard over teh years....
...but anyway...I'd suggest against it. we did tow the '78
westy with the '80 westy ~60 miles from San Rafael home to
Fremont, but funny thing...the engine in teh '80 blew #1
and #3 pistons the next week! Coincidence? Maybe, but it
was running great...only a few thousand on new AMC heads
and sucked two valve seats   had to weld in a couple oz's
of material in one head!!! new seats and a valve from the
78's engine as it was in the back of the '80 in pieces with
a cracked head.....  ;-0 Stick with light loads if you can
unless for short distances....and yes...flat tow would be
less stress. I recall the trailer I used tow my MGA and
Land-Rover to my current home weighed more than both
combined!!!! Almost was too much for the poor F-150 I had
at teh time.  ;-(
I'd suggest to tow.......NOTHING! and just get good at
de-poping/guarding the camp-site with a lawn-chair with a
note chained down to something in camp...it works great
usually.  ;-)

&gt; A few years ago I made a 4 hour trip up to Mendicino in a
&gt; '71 Westy to tow home a Type 3 Ghia with a tow dolly.
don't wanna imagine that down the coast road!  ;-0

&gt; The second trip I took was to flat tow another T34 from
&gt; Colorado Springs to San Jose behind my '66 Type 3 Ghia.
So......Larry..I'm guessing it is you I have seen around
town in the two different type III ghias over the last
fifteen years?  Cool cars! I'd love to come over one day to
see up close in person!
I always wanted one....have fond memories of my buddy's '70
ghia when not in my old '68 bug back than...and still think
of digging up a no dent K-ghia for a wide body(cut at the
knife edge of fenders and wided six inches) I dreamed up
back in the eighties...than install the origional 2.0l
engine from the '78 van after pumping it up a
bit...mmmmmmm!  ;-)
