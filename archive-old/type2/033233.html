Subject: Re:rear window defogger

Patrick,

In response to your query about the text-described relay in the circuit of 
the rear window defogger:
I've checked the wiring diagrams from 76 back to 69 and see no such relay. 
Maybe this was a design for an earlier version or a European-only version? 
In any case, you are nominated for &quot;manual proofreader of the year&quot; for 
finding this &quot;error&quot;.

By the way, my defogger stopped working long ago and I know that the reason 
is a loss of continuity in the surface wires that constitute the warming 
system on the window. Have you checked your's for continuity?

My question to the list: has anyone tried the Loctite repair paint and been 
successful? My careful scan of the wires with an ohmmeter tells me that 
there are numerous breaks in the wires and therefor to repair it I'll need 
to repaint every wire in the window for virtually its full length. To do 
this may take a lot of paint (at $10 per fraction of an ounce) and patience. 
Also to do that practically would require removing the door from the hinges 
so as to have a flat surface upon which to paint. But alas that results in 
rending an otherwise perfect paint job from the factory at the hinge 
connections. Is it worth a try?

Any experiences to be shared?

Thanks Volks,
