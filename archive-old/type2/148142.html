Subject: Re: [T2] engine swap ?

Hi Greg,

DTM, Down the Middle, replaces your existing bus pancake configuration
with an upright style system like the Type 1. If you go here:

http://www.massivetype4_dot_com/index2.shtml

the type 4 DTM is the lower picture. Then if you click on the picture,
it takes you to more pictures. I don't think you could fit this in a
bus due to the overhead clearance. It seems to be made for putting
type 4 motors in bugs and such. But while on that page, if you click
on &quot;Type 4 DTM and Your Car&quot;, it takes you to this menu which includes
buses:

http://www.massivetype4_dot_com/fit/main.shtml

If you click on late buses, you get this page:

http://www.massivetype4_dot_com/fit/bus-late.shtml

which says:

&quot;&quot;1972-79 Busses:

You guys are lucky, Type IV power was factory in your vehicles, let us
add more with our &quot;Camper special&quot; or our &quot;Powerstroke&quot; Bus engines.

Stay tuned as we have plans for an updated cooling fan arrangement for
better cooling with the stock TIV shroud arrangement!&quot;&quot;

So I don't know what he has in mind for buses.

 Will the DTM fit around the rear engine hanger on a bus?

 I saw the DTM in action (running on a stand) at last year's June
 jitterbug. It was being set up for a porsche speedster.  It looks
 like a very well thought out product, but I don't know that you could
 pot one in a bus, as there may not be room for the rear hanger. But
 I'd love to be wrong about that.
