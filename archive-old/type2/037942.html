Subject: Re: Curtains

	In 1968 or 1969 my dad sewed light blue curtains to go inside
our '68 Transporter (9 pass, white/red, grey interior). He copied
a Westie or some other existing design that used long coil-springs
at the top and bottom of the windows to hold the curtains, just folded
the cloth twice to make a hem big enough to also hold the spring
and ran one stictch across it after hemming the ends:
 _
|_at_| &lt;-- spring inserted after sewing
| |
||| &lt;--- stitch here 
|
:
|
||| &lt;--- stitch here
| |
|_|

	The ends of the springs had a couple turns bent over and a sheet-metal
screw held them in place to holes drilled in the body:
Curtain
   v    |
--------|
________|///(|) &lt;-- screw
          ^
        spring

For the 'middle' windows (on the door and opposite) I believe there
were two curtains, each half-width plus a bit, on the back it might have
been the same, I don't remember. That's the most logical way, 4 pairs
all the same.
