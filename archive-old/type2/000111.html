Subject: 99% complete 1979 westy in local salvage
Message-ID: &lt;0.8e60dee8.2531180a_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Greetings folks.....

Its a rare moment I get on here anymore, but my landscaping season is winding 
to a close.

Was in the local salvage hunting down a part for the wife's 74 super beetle, 
when I noticed a very complete 79 westy.

It had 2.0 L motor
automatic
complete interior
swivel captains chair
all curtains, cabinets,outlets,complete pop-top, very good shape
complete pull out upper bunk
excellent front beam
basically all i could see that had been stripped was a few of the F.I. stuff 
(injectors, etc.)

anyways i couldn't find anything i needed so i thought i should at least pass 
on the info.

it is at U-PULL IT salvage in Omaha, Ne ( the one on 11th and grace st)

sorry i wont be able to help pull anything maybe some other listee could 
help...hope someone can strip it out and use the stuff.

have fun,
zac
