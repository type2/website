Hello all,
I have experience with two different kinds of block heaters.  For the
upright engine I used one that bolted to the sump plate.  You mounted it by
removing three of the six little nuts and then placing the electrical
element in the cavity of the sump plate followed by the cover plate held on
by the three nuts.  The element extended to the rear where it hooked to an
electrical cord.  It worked quite well for keeping my oil flowing at lowwww
temps.  The only drawback was that you had to remove it to get at your oil
drain plug.  This made changing the oil a 3 nut, one drain plug experience
instead of only a drain plug thing.  I thought it was worth the extra effort
every 3000 during the winter.  I still use one on my Ghia if it ever gets
cold enough here.  So far it hasn't!  I bought mine at Canadian Tire in
Ontario.  It is made by &quot;Temro&quot; if my memory serves.  I have an extra one
for sale if anyone wants one.  Brand new.  In box.
With instructions.  $25 delivered anywhere in the lower 48.

The other kind I used was the magnetic type.  I've only used it on a type4
engine.  It is a block with a plate of aluminum (2 1/2&quot; X 3 1/2&quot; ??) and
magnets on one side.  It has a handle and cord coming out the other side.  I
stuck it to the oil drain plate when temps required it.  The oil drain plate
was the only sorta flat spot that was steel so a magnet would stick to it.
This heater worked well to keep the oil viscous.  I liked that I could just
stick it on when needed and the rest of the time it was under my seat.  It
still rides around in my bus.  Old habits die hard.

As for not doing anything outside once temps reach 25-30 below...   When
you've live anywhere that this happens on a regular basis you realize that
life just goes on no matter what the temp.  :-)  Anything lower than -45 and
MAYBE we're talking about staying home!  ;-)

Happy Holidays!
