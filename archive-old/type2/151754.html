Subject: Re: [T2] starter hanging up

Dan,

Either the solenoid on the starter hung &quot;on&quot; or your ignition switch did.

Running a starter for two minutes or so will make things very hot as it is 
a pulls *big* amps.

Probably the best thing was that the engine did *not* start with the 
starter hung on.

I liked the part about &quot;dilemma ensued&quot;....for me it would have 
been...mouth drops open and have a semi freak out making fast decisions 
about what to do first....

Hmmmm....not sure why the alternator wires would have melted tho...

Mechanic doesn't have the right equipment?????!!

Drop the engine, pull pressure plate off and inspect?

All it takes is a jack(or atv type lift) for the engine and a 13 or 14 mm 
socket to pull the pressure plate off.

See one here that I used:   http://www.shockwaverider_dot_com/newengine/

You didn't mention that it runs and shifts ok after the parts 
replacement...I am guessing no?...since you want to pull engine to inspect 
the clutch?

If it drives and shifts ok, then the clutch is probably ok.

The only other thing that might have happened is that the relay 
pints going to the starter got so hot they welded closed....but if you 
replaced parts and it starts and shifts well, then you are probably ok.

Lesson to be remembered....never start in any gear....that way you can 
release clutch and go get battery unhooked quickly!...But I bet you 
already figured that one out!


Cheers, dave

&gt; Tried to start bus with clutch depressed and transmission

&gt; Released key but starter kept trying to crank.  Could
&gt; not get transmission to neutral, i.e., stuck in reverse.
&gt; Turning key had no effect either to get engine to fire
&gt; or to get starter to cease trying to start on key release.
&gt; 
&gt; As could not get get out of gear, a dilemma ensued.
&gt; Continued to hold down clutch for about two minutes until
&gt; cranking slowed to more or less nothing, put emergency on
&gt; and full released clutch.  Starter still engaged, but
&gt; emergency brake stronger.
&gt; 
 Ran around to rear and popped open the engine compartment.
 A fair amount of smoke but this was smoke from melting
 wire.  Got battery out and disconnected, but burned my
 hands on ground strap.  Had it towed and, ultimately,
 have new starter/solenoid, new ground strap, and new
 wires to alternator which had melted.  This bus does
 have the aftermarket relay that shunts power to starter
 without the round trip to the front end/key.
 
 Looking for root cause, my mentor/mechanic recommends
 pulling engine to see if clutch is somehow in bad shape.
 Says he no longer has requisite equipment for some part
 of that operation, leaving me to seek another mechanic
&gt; and/or invest in whatever it is that he is missing.
&gt; Seems like a long shot.
&gt; 
&gt; What do you think?
