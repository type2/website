Subject: Re: shuddering -was [T2] 2.0L Engine Noise

Speaking from experience, I have loose motor mounts (they separated the
rubber; I drilled a hole straight through and put in l-o-n-g bolts, but they
do get loose.  This is not the source of shudder I also had- my clutch disk
had separtated  its lining and it was causing the grabbing and shuddering at
letting out the clutch.  A previous clutch disk I had on another vehicle had
a broken spring; this can also cause shuddering.

&gt; That shuddering on take off could be a clutch problem. If the disc is in
bad shape or if the flywheel or pressure plate surfaces are warped you will
get the same problem. If its your engine sputtering and coughing well thats
another story. Does the problem occur if you are on the highway at say
50mph, then floor it? If so then I would not suspect the
clutch,flywheel/pressure plate.
&gt;
&gt; Answer:
&gt;
&gt; NO, it happens only as described, first gear taking off if I let the
clutch in too fast, occasionally at similar time in second.
&gt;
&gt; Ouch! I was hoping for motor mounts!
