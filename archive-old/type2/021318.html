Subject: Turn signals

Greetings All!

This is my first posting - My name is Paul Sinfield, I drive a 69 baywindow in Los Angeles.

I'm curious - my otherwise normal working turn signal does not click off by itself once the turn has
been completed.  Is this a permanent feature of my bus, or is it something I could remedy with a
little tinkering?  I know I could have bigger problems, but it's pretty annoying, not to mention
unsafe to others when I forget to turn the thing off.

Thanks in advance for any thoughts!
