Hey there Chad,

I run 185R14 (D rated) Yokahama 356 supervans on my 79, and I like
them. Had to special order them, but shop around (regardless of
brand)and use the dealers &quot;price matching&quot; policy to your advantage. 

See the tire section in the Type2 library, under &quot;T&quot; for tires.

Make and models compiled by Steve Dolan at:

http://type2_dot_com/dworkin/tires/

Also there is a section in the AIRS area, which I think was put
together by the vintagebus people (15 inch stuff).

As always, other personal experiences can be found in the archives.

Hope this helps, 
(a r12 vs. r134a thread, a GAS thread, and now a TIRE thread, oh my
!)
