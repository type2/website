Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Oil on Concrete Garage Floor

The stuff Advance sells is called &quot;fuller's earth&quot; works very well.  I had
some in house but tried using some surplus kitty litter last week.  Some
(not all) kitty litter is anthracite clay and turns very mushy/gooey and
sticks to everything.  I'll never do that again!  (I guess  you could use
kitty litter if you sweep it up right away and don't let it get wet).

&gt;Visit your favorite FLAPS and buy a back of the oil absorbent. Basically a
&gt;fancy version of kitty litter but it doesn't get so mushy like the kitty
&gt;litter I've used in the past.
