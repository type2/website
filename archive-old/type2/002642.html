Having pulled the distributor to check p/n I have discovered a modified =
009 in my 79 california bus engine. It has the air biscuit (two tubes) =
attached to the side and it has electronic ignition.

Wanting to make sure I have the correct setup for my bus, what should be =
checked/verified/changed.=20

Can this modified 009 be okay? I know it has been in the bus for 10 =
years cross country and back. PO was best friend. Is the correct 093 =
very different and is it expensive/hard to come by?

Thoughts?
