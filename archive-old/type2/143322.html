Subject: Re: [T2] Compression sucks

&gt; you didn't mention if you plugs are wet,, as in gas is getting to the
&gt; cylinders..


Not wet. I'm thinking there's still no gas getting in there.

I took the valve train apart and put it back together. I don't know what was
wrong, but compression came up to: Cyl 1= 95, Cyl 2= 70. Interesting side
note: Cyl 2's intake lifter seems squishy! I don't know how. It's a solid
lifter. I checked the pushrod for damage, nothing found. Bizarre...

Anyway, I can get a pop out of the carb if I advance too far. Pretty blue
flame out of the carbs. heh At least SOME gas is getting in there, but
whether it's from the accel pump or what, I dunno. I can make the engine
sputter for a second, but that's it. Even if I pour gas into the throats of
the carbs directly.

I'm stuck I think.
