Subject: re: [T2] Sway Bars?

Mine did wonders for handling and stability, well worth it. Moderate
nuisance to get the bushing clips on and off using normal tools, but not too
bad. No alignment required as far as I could tell...the upgrade is fatter in
diameter, but shouldn't change any static geometry.

&lt;SNIP&gt;
I am thinking of installing a bigger sway bar on the front end of my bus,
probably the sway away kit from Bus Boys. Maybe a rear one down the road
but maybe not. I just got new tires (Yokoham 356 load range D) and am
really happy with the improvements. What I am wondering is what types of
improvements can I look for with a sway bar that is bigger than stock? I
don't want the suspension to be so tight that I feel every little crack in
the road, but will this help some of the body roll from driving in high
winds or when  big truck goes by. I know that nothing will eliminate these
effects entirely and thats part of the excitement from driving a bus, but
what I am really asking is based on your experience with one of these bars
&quot;is it worth it?&quot; Also how much of a PITA is the install? Will I need an
alignment afterwards. Do I need any special tools?
