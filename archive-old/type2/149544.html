Subject: RE: [T2] solenoid trouble

&gt;Tomorrow I'm going to clean the ignition contact, but that's all I can
&gt;think to do.  So what's going on?  Why is this happening?  Is it the
&gt;solenoid or the ignition?  How can I check?  I've got my handy
&gt;multimeter and an iron will ready to do the work.   Suggestions?
&gt;
Muir shows a test (It begins on page 48 of the Idiot's Guide. Step 5 on 51 
outlines the test for solenoid, starter and switch.) that I just did and 
found a bad ignition switch.

George
