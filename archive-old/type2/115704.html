&gt; OK, I've looked through the archives and I see lots of various hints and
&gt; tips but I wanted to find out what the current thinking is on this.
&gt; 
&gt; Do I do shims in both places?

no.

shim the base, lose the top sealing ring. it is a LEAKING ring. set the CR
as desired with a shim of the correct thickness, many sizes are available.

lap the cylinders into the head with valve grinding paste. do your heads
have a step in the chamber? this step cut is a good trick for cylinder
sealing.
