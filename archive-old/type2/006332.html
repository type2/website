There should be lots in the Type 2 archives about these tires, they've been
discussed frequently.

As I recall the load rating [pounds per tire] was not up to VW specs for
campers.  Might be a question on the inflation pressure as well.

A couple of years ago they were claiming these tires were built by B. F.
Goodrich.....

&gt;&gt;  I stopped by Costco today.  They sell a 6 ply &quot;c&quot; rated all season
195/75R14 tire under the name &quot;Kirkland&quot;.  Salesman said they are
manufactured at a Uniroyal plant (owned by Michelin), and the tire did seem
a lot like the Uniroyal Laredo.  &lt;&lt;
