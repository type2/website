A while back (while we were walking down this yellow brick road :) there
was this energy crisis, back in the 70's.  At that time, there was a
surge in interest in electric cars, and the US Dept. of Energy funded a
lot of conversion projects.  One utility company in the southeast
converted a dozen or so VW vans, which then gathered dust for years.  Look
at:

for more info. An archive search on electric conversion will also turn up
other posts (hint, hint :)

But, in practice, there is.
