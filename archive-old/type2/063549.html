Subject: Re: asbestos in VWs?

In article &lt;199609171341.JAA13142_at_cortex.uchc_dot_edu&gt; rvanness_at_neuron.uchc_dot_edu (Ron Van Ness) writes:

&gt; The piece in question is the seal that mates the front of the heat exchanger
&gt; hot air outlet to the black plastic accordian tube.  The older seals were
&gt; asbestos.  On both my '70 and '71 bus the asbestos seals were crumbling and
&gt; no doubt the fibers were traveling up the heat tube with the hot air.  The
&gt; rubber replacement seal is only a few $--buy one for each side and try not
&gt; to inhale the asbestos as you're cleaning off the residue :=|.  I just
&gt; replaced them at my cost--my feeling is that if I were to hold VW
&gt; accountable for every item on my 25 year old bus that is unsafe by today's
&gt; standards, I would probably decide not to drive a bus in the first place.
&gt; 

I agree with Ron here, but would like to make one additional provision
[how can you tell I have been answering RFQs all week ;)].  When you
change the asbestos gasket/seal you should change the filter in the
&quot;black plastic accordion tube&quot; as it is felt and will be contaminated
with asbestus fibres.  The catch [Catch-22...there's only one] is
that, last I checked the filter could not be obtained separately from
the enveloping tube...unless you managed to aquire filters from a late
model 'loaf...or decide to run without them.

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Splits...Oh, my!
