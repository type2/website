I've had the same reservations expressed by Jan-Willem.  I think that
the concerns might vary depending upon the characteristics of the
vehicle being tilted.  In the case of the Type II, I would think that
the stub axles and hubs could take the strain (gently) and that the
front suspension torsion arms would be up to it, but I would feel uneasy
about the side loads that the device would place upon the rear
suspension.  At the rear, the load would be distributed among the spring
plate, the trailing arm, and the drive axle.

If anyone would like to see one of these devices (as well as a rotator),
one of the manufacturers, Accessible Systems, has a web site at:
