Subject: [T2] '77 crankcase ventilation hose

Does anyone know where/what you can get/do
to replace the crankcase ventilaiton hose on a
fuel injected 1977 bus?  Mine's rotten and leaks.  
I'm hoping it'll be the last piece causing my 
starting trouble - vacuum leak.  

Thanks in advance,
Christopher Darilek
