&gt;&gt; The light would flash only when reaching a certain RPM. We towed it home and
&gt;&gt; today I did a compression test. 100 in cylinders 1,3,and 4 105 in
&gt;&gt;cylinder 2.
&gt;&gt; Muir says that this light flashing at high idle means overhaul time but how
&gt;&gt; can I need an overhaul with Good compression in all cylinders.
&gt;
&gt;You need to split your case, either have it align-bored on a Rottler boring
&gt;machine (accept no substitutes!) or buy a new one (preferable), have the
&gt;rods rebushed, have the crankshaft and camshaft reground and change all your
&gt;bearings, main, rod and cam. http://www.macsalon_dot_org/howtos/vwengine.html
&gt;will tell you what to get.

Whoa there, that's a lot of work based on one little red light.  The first
thing you need to do is verify that there is really a problem.  Install a
real oil pressure gauge and verify that the pressure is really low, or have
a shop confirm the low pressure for you.

As Bob mentioned, an align bore is rarely needed on type IV engines.

Oh, and get a real manual (Bentley).  Muir-isms do not always apply to the
type IV engine.  Muir is good for the touchy-feely stuff like whether or
not to buy a particular bus, but you need more specific technical
information for your late model engine.

&gt;You can *theoretically* just change the piston rings when you do the
&gt;shortblock overhaul, but you're sitting at the lower end of good compression
&gt;so live it up and change the pistons &amp; cylinders too.

He mentioned that he is at high altitude.  His compression readings are
nicely balanced and not out of line for high altitude so no need to waste
money on pistons and cylinders IMO.
