Subject: Re: [T2] replacing dash lights / or repairing dash light wiring

It's not necessary to pull the instruments out to replace your bulbs, it is
cramped though.  The Bently has a wiring diagram that will orient you  to
the sockets you seek and then it's a matter of rotating the socket 90
degrees and slipping it forward so you can pull the offending bulb out. It's
hard to see, and hard to reach and hard to keep your fingers pinched like
that for a long time, but after the first one it gets easier.  It is, I
think, much preferable to disconnecting everything and hoping to get it all
back right, thought the Bently diagram could help you do that, too.
good luck and remember to breathe,
Jody
