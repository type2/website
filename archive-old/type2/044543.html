I checked with Bulley about the smell and here's what he said:


&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

You ever walk by a dumpster behind a seafood restaurant in the summer? 
Pretty hideous, huh?

Well Kool Patch doesn't smell like that. In fact, it doesn't smell at
all. 
It smells like rubbing alcohol when it goes on (the solvent), and has no 
smell once dried. Further, in the interior, the only places where Kool 
Patch is used (should be used) are sealed behind vapor barrier, or under 
NASA insulation so you wouldn't smell it, even if it were smelly.

Remember the old Yiddish saying: Givish gehimmina, schmeltz fartzen in
de 
bulli habben. Roughly translated: &quot;After a day of summer driving, you
will 
always smell worse than your van.&quot;

&gt; I have always thought that the aluminum side of Whitney's stuff should
&gt; be on the inside.
&gt; Putting the foil against the outer bus metal might tend to promote
&gt; condensation entrapment.
&gt; In fact I am almost &quot;sure&quot; that can happen.
&gt; 
&gt; In one's house, the paper vapor barrier is on the inside surface area.
&gt; 
&gt; Question(s):
&gt; When applying that Kool Koat stuff on the interior surfaces of  bus
&gt; outer walls, are we addressing the possible need for condensation
&gt; weepage/drainage, and does the Kool Koat stink up the bus with any asphalt
&gt; type stench during the hot Summer months?
