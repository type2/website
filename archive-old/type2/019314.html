Same thing happened to me a year ago.  It was the voltage regulator.  The
good news is, they don't cost much and they aren't difficult to replace.

&gt; Intermittent red light on
&gt; On the way home from High Country Bus fest, My generator light came on
&gt; brightly. Fan belt fine. Started up, three miles down the road, back on.
&gt; Stayed off after restart, but I was only 2 miles from home. Any ideas?
&gt; Voltage regulator?All connections look fine, and was a very bright light.
&gt;
&gt; High Country Bus fest was GREAT. Hats off the Mike Myers and my buds from
&gt; the Full Moon Bus Club.
