Subject: Re: [T2] Neon roof pics

I look at it this way.
If there is a fire from the engine compartment, if it
hits the ceiling the odds are the bus is gone anyway.

I don't cook in the bus, use candles or smoke. All cooking
is done outside so the open flame situation is reduced. Honestly
if there is flame from the engine and it hits the roof, the bus is gone.
All that is important while on the road is, kids-&gt;seatbelts off-&gt;out of the
bus and watch it burn to the ground. I have a nice sized extinguisher
within reach and will try my best but Im guessin we can roast some
nice marshmellows while we sing koombayah ;)

Point taken though
Thx

James
p.s... Im thinking of installing a sprinkler system in the van ;)

&gt;Be careful, Dude.  In a bus fire this stuff could turn the experience into 
&gt;a
&gt;literal &quot;hell&quot; of a time.
