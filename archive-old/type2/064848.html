&gt;HElp!

&gt;I am having trouble removing the ign lock assembly from the steering 
&gt;column of my 71 Bus. I do not have the key as I bought the bus for $250 
&gt;with a engine fire. The column and lock are fairly well dismantled, but 
&gt;it seems to be wedged in tight against the external facia cover. Removed 
&gt;all screws, including a really tiny one I will be lucky to find again if 
&gt;I lose. What do I do?
&gt;

The unit (that the steering column goes through) which houses the ignition 
switch has to be completely removed (Bentley has pretty clear instructions). 
There are screws (big Phillips head) that bolt the unit to the dash. 

The ignition unit is a two part assembly 1) switch (the small screw you lost 
is the lock screw I think) 2) the tumbler/lock unit. I replaced both in my 
'71. To replace the &quot;lock&quot; you'll need to find a locksmith who knows where to 
drill a hole to push down spring that holds switch in.

Good luck!
