Subject: Re: [T2] sound dampening

I think I'll go with the carpet pads on the floor and something else in the doors, etc.  Thanks...KR

&gt; Well, I hate to beat a dead horse but here goes. 
&gt; I've scoured the  archives and found all kind of
&gt; products for sound dampening.  

Sorry if I missed a previous posting about this, but
what sounds are you trying to dampen? The old
fashioned way to dampen all sound was to use (usually
an OLD) carpet pad or two, topping off with carpet...
That eventually was left in when the engine died and
the bus sat out back under the apple tree for years,
until one of &quot;US&quot; bought it for $10 and discovered
that once the critter nests in the multi layers of
carpet were removed, there was actually no floor left!

The carpet pads and carpet are heavy, but the do kill
the noise. My bus had shag carpet contact cemented
over all interior surfaces when I got it. Once I
removed all that, I heard everything! I have pickup
bed liner sprayed all through Bussy, with 20 gauge
sheetmetal below that on expanding foam to fill the
corrugated florring. Not a lot of good for noise
killing, but there isn't really much noise except on
rough roads! -BaH
