&gt;mine (also 70 bus) was an allen wrench (sorry, i dont know what size) but
&gt;i was sold the star shaped bit by a VW supplier to install the new bolts
&gt;that came with the new boot kit. i still dont know why the old bolts
&gt;werent stars. i figured that was why he sold me the bit. i was about to
&gt;take it back when i realized the new bolts needed it. whew!

My experience also except I originally cancelled my tool order then the new boots came and I discovered that only the original boots had hex head bolts.

I posted this back in Nov. regarding the tool needed for the other type of screw used:

It's a triple square or sometimes called a serrated wrench. Get the right 
tool in case this happens again in the future. 

Visit your VWFLAPS. They either have BugPack Tool #7057 or EMPI #5796.

...or try Pepboys for K-D which for the same price as the socket you'll get 
4 bits (6-8-10-12mm I think) which fit into a 3/8&quot; socket...

Whatever tool you purchase, be sure to clean all dirt and grime from the bolts otherwise the heads will likely strip trying to remove them.
