Subject: My bus saga (long and probably dull)

Been absent for some months, doubt anyone missed me.  Hello anyhow.  Wanted to
share my delightful little bus saga.

Background:  Bought my '78 maybe a year and a half ago, right before throwing a
plywood bed in it and taking a vacation from Salem, Oregon to Omaha, Nebraska.
Went muchos milos without so much as a hickup.  Fantastic trip both scenicly and
mechanically.

This year we decided we'd return to Santa Barbara, California, where we lived
before moving up here.  It soon became evident that our bus' stalwart endurance
had been cured by a year in my care.

We were two hours departed when the first problem occured.  Engine got fairly hot
on I-5, then after stopping at Carl's Jr. the engine would't start.  Actually, the
starter wouldn't start either.  Plenty of battery juice, just no cranking.  Swore
quite a bit, stripped off the nice shirt and crawled under.  Shorted the starter
between the two hot terminals, and it cranked angrily.  Started immediately after
that.  Okay, hot soak.

Got all the way to Sacramento, California without anymore problems.  Fine.  Couple
days later, going down Highway 1, it started stuttering violently, as if all four
cylinders were losing power.  I'm accustomed to the feel of not firing on all four
(in a few respects), and this was definately a loss on all four.  This had
happened to me about eight months ago, and I immediately changed the fuel filter;
the problem disappeared.

And so it disappeared right then after jamming the clutch in.  A momentary
hickup?  Hopefull.  Next day we got to beautiful Santa Barbara.  Well, the wife
got extremely sick with a fever, but that's a different story.  On the way out of
town on our second day there (heading to El Capitan State Beach, maybe 15 miles
north), it happened again really, really badly (the stutter).  We had to stop the
bus on the side of the highway, but when I started up again it was okay.  Got to
the campground.

Next day I went to a shop and bought a fuel filter, points and condensor.  On the
way back to the campground (now Wednesday), it started shuddering so bad we had to
pull over.  I replaced the fuel filter in a parking lot; no effect.  Pulled the
Compufire module and dropped in the points and condensor; no effect.  Decided that
it was my vacation and I didn't want to spend it working on my bus, so I started
calling mechanics.

The long and the short is this: there are exactly two shops in Santa Barbara who
will even *look* at a fuel injection Volkswagon (the dealer is not among them).
Bob's Import needed a week to see me, the Bosch-authorized place agreed to
*squeeze* me in the next day.  We limped out to the campground, then came back in
the next morning with no problems until just before we reached the mechanic.  He
suggested that, rather than paying him $65/hr to make the problem occur, I should
drive it around until it stutters, then pull into the garage and let him test the
sensors, etc.

Henceforth I shit you not: we drove for three hours.  We drove up the hills in
Summerland (very steep).  We drove back and forth on 101 in the middle of the hot
day.  We drove out to the the campground.  We drove back again.  We drove in the
city, the country, the highway.  It never happened again.  Ever.  After being told
by the mechanic that any further attention would simply be an expensive fishing
expedition, we decided that we ought to go back home before we spent all the money
we'd need for repairs.

All the way home, and in the week since, the bus has run flawlessly (other than
the starting problem, which is no mystery anyway).  Okay, well, if not flawlessly
then at least without violent shuddering.  I cannot think of any occasion on which
I have sworn more vigorously than when driving around Santa Barbara.  Anyone who's
been there knows how expensive a place it is to get stuck in.

So that's my tale.  If anyone has any ideas concerning my stuttering, I'd love to
hear it.  I had thought it to be heat-related, but the oil and heads we plenty hot
on the thousand mile trip back home.  On the way back I decided I needed something
to fixate on, in order to calm my nerves, so at each stop I took the coil out and
into the restaraunt, house, etc. with me.  Could it concievably be the coil
getting hot-soaked?  Seems unlikely, but hell, I don't know.

Okay, this has already been a rudely-long post for someone who hadn't been around
for a while.  Thanks for reading (or skipping over, as the case may be).

btw, the mechanic was Peter at the Engine Company.  He was extremely helpfull, and
though he chewed me a bit concerning the, um, non-stock condition of my engine, he
was great.
