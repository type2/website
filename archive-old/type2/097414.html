Subject: Fw: [T2] bike rack

 Got the same rack, had the same problem with the same solution. Fits pretty
 much all our cars. Not particularly elegant but practical.

 We used a generic bike rack from Target ($39 I think) on the back of my
&gt; '73 to carry two bikes.  It worked well enough although there were two
minor
&gt; issues - first the strap adjusters tended to slip which let the rack sag
&gt; down occasionally.  Solved this by knotting the adjuster straps.
