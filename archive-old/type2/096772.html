Subject: vw manual in austin tx

the guadalupe st. half-price books has the vanagon bentley manual in 
nice shape, $50.

if someone on the vanagon list as well would be so kind as to pass 
that on........

-T2 content: i was looking for some engine blueprinting books; nada. 
but i did get the bentley for the T3 for $12 - now i just need the T4 
and vanagon (well, a vanagon one for less than $50!) to know how to 
fix em all  :)  -
