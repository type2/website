Subject: Re: [T2] lightened flywheels for hill country

When I had my 78x88 type I engine built for my '71 westy, my mechanic
insisted I get a lightened flywheel. I was skeptical, because I had read an
article in Hot VW's magazine that said that a lightened flywheel had to be
removed from their westy because of stalling.  However, I have plenty of low
speed and uphill grunt (I regularly go over steep hills and occassionly over
a 10,000 foot pass in the Sierras).  I have never stalled the engine.  The
engine has a Scat forged counterweighted crank and a Berg 6 pound pulley,
the combination of which easily outweighs the metal removed from the
lightweight flywheel.  I don't think there is an easy answer, you should
weigh all the factors, including the cam and type of carburation you will
run.  In a worse case scenario, if you did have problems with a lightened
flywheel, I feel certain that a 6 pound pulley on the other end of the crank
would solve any problems.
