Subject: Re: Suggestions on frustrating fuel problem?

Sounds like you may have rust, dirt and/or other such crap in the fuel tank.
Your bus' symptoms sound like what my bus was experiencing at one time. When
you remove the fuel filter can gas flow (almost gush) freely from the tank?
See Richard Atwell's piece on cleaning out and sealing the fuel tank:Also, you
can check fuel pressure with a fuel pressure gauge. According to Bentley, a
fuel injected bus should have about 35psi (2.5 kg/cm2), measured at the fuel
distribution manifold between the #3 and #4 injectors on the left side.

Just after that I started experiencing intermittent and elusive fuel
starvation problems, the guys were booked out at the time, so I couldn't put
Tigger back in to locate the problem, and it sorta cleared up by itself, so
I put it down to getting a batch of bad fuel and having a smaller volume
fuel filter than she'd had before the service.
