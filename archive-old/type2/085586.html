Subject: Re: [T2] Removing Fuel Tank Panel

Hi Steven,

Even after the hidden screws are pulled, the panel is often very hard to
budge. The edge of the panel is folded bback on itself and is wedged  into a
groove in the engine bay so that it resist coming out. Put on a thick pair
of leather gloves, grab one end and reef on it repeatedly until it lets go.
Lots of sharp, strong tugs and it will eventually come loose.


Happy trails,

Greg Potts
