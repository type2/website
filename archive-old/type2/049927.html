&gt; I just wanted the lists opinion on my automatic transmission options.  I've 
&gt; got a 74 bus which had vacuum shift auto tranny in it, it never shifted well 
&gt; and leaked tranny fluid.  I'm upgrading from 1800 with single carb to 2.0L 
&gt; with FI and I was going to have auto tranny rebuild for $400 while motor is 

who have you found to rebuild an older vacuum shift tranny, as far as I
know the parts for the rebuild are no longer avaliable

&gt; out.  I've just found a 76 automatic which is severely rusted but complete.  

but does it work???  or do you mean the bus is rusted, any idea on the
condition of the tranny??

&gt; The seller wants $250.  So here is my question, should I just buy this bus 
&gt; and pull the &quot;newer&quot; automatic tranny with governor and put this in my 74.  

I would deffinately go for the newer tranny if possible, at least the
parts for the rebuild are still avaliable

&gt; I'm thinking I'm going to buy this bus regardless I need a gas tank to run FI 
&gt; and I wouldn't mind having FI parts lying around either.  Someone must have 
&gt; done this conversion to a newer autotranny and it doesn't look like it's a 
&gt; straight switch to me.  Would all with autotrannys agree that this is a 
&gt; definite upgrade?  Any info on the conversion would be appreciated.  I know 

the newer tranny is far more reliable

&gt; that the shifter linkages are different but I'll have the buses side by side 
&gt; when attempting this.  I have no idea what sort of condition the tranny in 

right the shifter linkages need to be changed

&gt; the 76 is in.  The PO can't remember and the bus hasn't moved since 1989 the 
&gt; odometer shows 145000.  What should I do to tranny before putting it in my 74 

drop the pan off the bottom and drain and clean the filter (comma shaped
thing held by two screws)

&gt; besides replacing seals?  Is there any way to bench test or check anything on 

remember the tranny shaft seal is not pushed all the way in, it stays
flush with the case.

no possible way to bench test the tranny without big bucks equipment, if
there is any way to drive the 76 van enough to test the tranny it is well
worth the effort

&gt; it before hand?  Friends and family think I've lost my mind and wife isn't 

standard for most families and friends think this way, but they like to
ride in em when you finish

&gt; crazy about having an ugly green rotten parts bus sitting in the yard beside 
&gt; Madison (74 bus).  If I've go through with this I've told her that I'll have 

if you have a garage strip it and get rid of the hulk

&gt; things wrapped up by March 15, 2001.  Thanks in advance and thanks to all who 

surely you jest, remember &quot;murphy drives a VW van&quot;
