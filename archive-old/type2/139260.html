Subject: tired--Vredestein vs. Hankook RA08

just my 2cents on the tired thread--glad we are just talking just 185R14C's
here (or 185/82/14C in Load Range D only of course). :) took a long time to
get that straight.

A few months ago I bought a pair of Vredestein Comtracs from a
non-bus-vendor before Bus Depot announced that they are selling tires.  The
regular Comtrac is a &quot;highway rib&quot; type tire, not the &quot;Winter&quot; version Ron
sells, and NOT M+S by any means, in fact they slip and slide quite a bit
just driving on dry dirt roads (I expect the winters would be much better
for this).  But I was impressed at how beefy the Vredesteins are, and they
appear to have quite a bit of sidewall reinforcement.  Ron, is there a
reason you don't sell the regular Vredestein Comtrac?

Just last week I ordered a pair of the Hankook RA08's from Bus Depot.  In
comparison, the tire is not quite as beefy, a little lighter, but looks like
it will be better in the mud/snow.  It does not appear to have as much
sidewall reinforcement/stiffness as the Vredestein Comtrac.  But it is over
$20 cheaper per tire.  I was highly tempted to go for a pair of the Comtrac
Winters but the price difference won me over to the Hankooks.  I am
monitoring this thread, because eventually I need to get 2 more tires, maybe
to make a matching set of 4, but mainly for spares (the Alaska highway is in
my future, where 2 spares would be appropriate!).

Slighty off topic, does anyone know where I might find a good 165R15 tire
for my '67 beetle?  I am in the Atlanta area. . . or just pmail what brand
you would recommend I should look for, I know Kumho makes one in Euro Metric
but hard to find. . .

TIA,
Will A.
