Travis, you are not going crazy. I have the same plug in my loom; it is cylindrical with three male prongs recessed back in the cylinder. The cable from this disappears into the wiring loom. I'll see if I can get a digital camera from work and take a picture of it if no one recognizes the description.

My engine has never been in my bus, so I don't have any clues as to where this would have attached. However, when I purchased the engine, this plug was already capped with an end-cap, so I assume it's attachment isn't necessary. I do plan to hunt around to see if I can figure out where the current flows, but I figured I'd do this after I get everything else attached where appropriate.

Maybe this plug goes into the test circuitry to support the VW computer diagnostics plug?

Thanks! Joe
