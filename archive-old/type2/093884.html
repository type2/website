&gt;Jan and all the rest of you 5 speed wannabes...
&gt;
&gt; Listee Mike Gensler plopped a 5 speed Porsche tranny in his 
&gt;bus when he planted a 2.0l 914 Porsche engine in it.

If anyone is curious, Dan (sorry, I've forgotten your last name) was kind
enough to post my write-up on his website.  You can read all the gory
details at
http://www.geocities_dot_com/MotorCity/Speedway/1974/freewayflyer.htm
If that doesn't tell you what you want to know, please feel free to e-mail
me.
