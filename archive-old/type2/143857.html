Subject: Re: [T2] How to make a 72 rear bumper fit a 71?

Man, if only there was someone out there with a '72
bus who needs a rear bumper in restored shape!

I have a '72 and it took me over a year to find one of
these.

Maybe try throwing it on the samba for sale/trade?

I know, it's more hassle, the purists would honor you,
though.

just a thought
Jason
