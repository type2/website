&gt; Some shops say use anything, even GL5, some say use only GL4.  I went with

&gt; Probably the only safe alternative. Isn't the first change at 500 miles or
&gt; so, I wonder if gl4 then a switch is a cheaper alternative?

That is what I did, but a transmission doesn't have to seat rings so
there's no real reason not to use synthetic from the beginning except for
expense.  I only went 100 miles before switching.
