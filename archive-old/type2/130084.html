Subject: No Power to Coil

I have a 68' Kombi with a Petronix points replacement installed.  I pulled 
the engine several months ago to replace one of the heads (burnt valve).

Now it's all back together (almost) and it will not start.  I am not 
getting any spark, and it looks like I am not getting any power to the 
coil.  Unfortunately, my friend disconnected most of the wires running to 
the coil/distributer, so I don't remember exactly how it looked before we 
pulled it.

Based on the instructions from the Petronix unit, and the Bently manual, I 
have things wired correctly.  The Petronix is wired to posts 1 and 15 on 
the coil.

The wire running from the ignition switch has what looks like a fuse 
holder.  I can't find the fuse, if there was one, that was in there.  With 
the key turned to the &quot;on&quot; position, there is no power to this wire.  All 
of the other electrics work - horn, turn signals, starter, etc.  Is there a 
wire directly from the battery or starter that should run to the coil that 
I might be missing?

TIA
