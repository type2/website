&gt; Ok, I've read all of the archives, and looked at the bentley, but i =
&gt; still cant figure this horn out.  What am I missing?
&gt; There are 2 wires that connect to the horn.  There is a wire that runs =
&gt; down through the steering column and looks to be in contact with one of =
&gt; the bolts that connects the steering column to the steering box. =20
&gt; If i get under the bus I can see another wire with a female spade =
&gt; connector that I'm guessing connects to the steering box so that the =
&gt; circuit is completed when I push the horn button, but I just can't =
&gt; figure out where it connects. Any advice?

The power goes into the horn but the ground wire coming out of the horn does not complete the circuit until you press the horn button and &quot;ground out the wire.&quot;  If you take the horn button off you can pull the wire off the connector and ground it to the steering column.  If that
doesn't work move down line and try grounding directly from the horn by pulling off the brown ground wire and run a test lead from the connector to ground somewhere on the body.  If it works there you have a bad connection somewhere between the horn and the column.  If not, its
either power not getting to the horn or the horn itself.  I've been told that many seemingly dead horns can be revived by taking the horn apart and cleaning the contacts inside.  But, sometimes its just easier to get a new horn.
