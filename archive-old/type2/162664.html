Subject: Re: [T2] exhaust pipe wanted.

have a 78 bus with the 72-74 muffler on it, but not heater boxes just J
pipes.  well the cyl#1-2 pipe broke about an inch or so before the muffler
so I am looking for a right side 72-74 pipe or heater box but the heater
box part can be garbage as long as the header inside is in good shape.
have it welded together for the moment but doubt that will pass emissions
which I have coming up fairly soon.

preferably in the Mid Atlantic area, I'm in Baltimore

Thanks
Bob
