I like your web page.  I have a message that I would like to get out to
VW owners out there.
Do you have a message board where I can post the following information ?

Would you like to be in a VW documentary ?

I'm an independent filmaker who is planning to make a film about VW
owners who have interesting stories about there cars or buses. I'm
looking for people who can relate their VW experiences to the &quot;big
picture&quot; in some way. If you have video, film footage, or still pictures
that relate to your VW story, this is a big plus.
I'm planning to eventually travel the country to interview the best
candidates, but I would like to start locally, here in the LA area if
possible.
 This is a non paying project, but a great way to get your story out
there.
 Please e-mail your information to wolfbauch_at_earthlink_dot_net
 Please include a brief decription of your VW story or experience.
 I look forward to hearing from you soon.
 You can visit www.provisiononline_dot_com to see some of my past projects
if you are interested.
 Mike Bauch
