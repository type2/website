Subject: # 3 no work?
Content-Disposition: Inline

Hi All
I bought a 83 Vanagon air cooled with a known blown #4 piston. Replaced
#4 with a good piston and cyl but now # 3 no work? # 3 has good
compression , spark and Im sure it is getting gas from weber 40DCNF carb
which I disassembled and cleaned. It looked like new
inside and out. I  also cleaned and bled the lifters etc etc. I am
baffled cause I never had
fire, compression and gas and no work.
Appreciate all ideas from brilliant listees.
