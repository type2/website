Subject: Re: 10 Commandments of Bus

1. Change the oil

2. Change your plugs (Bosch Supers only)

3. Lube your beam as needed.  It will steer much better.

4. Do a pre-flight check daily.

5. Listen to your engine more than you do the radio.

6. Don't be afraid to travel in your bus.  it actually makes it run better
when you drive it.

7. Join A.I.R.S....it's a good thing.  (Only give the info you want people
to see.)

8. Don't rest your hand on the shifter while driving.

9. Don't rest your foot on the clutch while working in traffic.

10. Smile and wave at everyone going down the road.
