I'll put in my 2-cents.

My VDO tach runs dead steady on the freeway, so I would not consider any
wobbling &quot;normal&quot;. Also, with your '74 tranny, which, I believe is a 4.86
R&amp;P and .88 4th, you should be running around 3500-ish RPM _at_ 60 MPH, with
185/75's. So says Scott &amp; Maggie's RPM--&gt;MPH calculator at:

http://www.scottandmaggie_dot_com/gearcalc.asp

You can put your actual numbers in, and see what comes up.

Good luck -

&gt;  &gt;The only thing which needs some attention is that the rmp
&gt;  &gt;vary a lot when driving at a constant speed.
&gt;
&gt;  Most VDO tachs that I've seen have dip switches on them to select for
4,6,
&gt; or 8
&gt;  cylinder installations.  I remember reading on the list a few months ago
&gt; that
&gt;  someone's brand-new VDO instructions were in error on the switch
settings.
&gt; So
&gt;  you might want to contact VDO and make sure your switches are right.
&gt;   &gt;&gt;
&gt; Come to think of it my VDO tach has dip switches that have to be set for
4,
&gt; 6, or 8 cylinders and the directions they sent me were backwards.  It took
me
&gt; awhile to get it to register correctly.  Good suggestion to check the dip
&gt; switches and possibly try diferent combinations.  My Vdo tach is steady.
