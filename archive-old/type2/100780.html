Subject: does everyone that we moved?

Hey folks,


I am not sure if this got out but we just finished moving our shop again. We
are at 1634 N 63rd Street, Unit #3, still in beautiful Boulder, Colorado. We
have less out side space but more inside space. This is nice as we now have
everything inside and climate controlled. That's over 150 doors that will
last years until you need them, not to mention the thousands of other parts
from seat cores, bumpers to well everything for bay window buses. We have
also started doing more restoration and service work. This only helps
expanded our knowledge of what parts these buses need and let's us
communicate better with those, how to questions. Thanks again for everyone's
support and please stop by when your in town and check us out.

Please welcome, Tyler (order processing), Kurt (order processing), Charley
(service), and Scott (body work) on board,

Joe Mitchell
