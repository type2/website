Subject: Re: [T2] Road Trippin

Just drove from Berkeley, CA to Madisson, WI via transCanada Highway.  It is
MUCH more beautiful than any other route on a major highway.  You also avoid
the areas of unbelievable heat found in the west US.  It took five days at a
very reasonable pace.  Some considerations though:  you have to drive over
the Coquihalla Hwy, which is very steep (You'll know if your engine is good
if you can do it in 3rd).  Also, many of these areas are sparsely populated,
especially with VWs.  You're in Taurus and Crown Victoria country.  Print
out AIRS!

1st Night in Seattle or NW Wash.
2nd Night in Banff (beautiful place with good bars)
3rd Night in Sascatchewan somewhere.
4th Night in North Dakota or Minnesota
5th Night in the Windy City

Might I also recommend on the return trip a combination of US rts 24 and 36.
They are amazing and no longer than the interstate. Some of the most
friendly people I have ever met.

As far as heaters, buy a Coleman $15 propane cannister style heater.  Use it
to warm up the bus and once it's warm inside, your heater should do the
rest.  If you do this drive soon, you definitely won't want the heater...

good luck,
Blaine
