&gt;i see that the only diff. is the Vacuum can part #

Hi Ben -

I am of the opinion that the &quot;F&quot; distributor would work fine, as the
advance specs are close enough to fudge.  If it were mine, I would swap the
vacuum advance cans for proper advance on the vacuum side.  The
centrifigual is essentially the same, except with the 9-14 advance coming
on at 2000 in stead of 1600 for the MT (gentler curve.

When running just the hose to the advance side, I find it the best to time
it between 0 to 5 degrees BTDC.  The centrifigual advance is not dependent
entirely on the vacuum can.  My buddy Cliff does it best tho - connect the
hose and run it up to 3400rpm and make sure it doesn't exceed 32 degrees
total advance with the strobe light.  It should back on down to a
respectable idle - you may to readjust the idle, so keep that in mind.
