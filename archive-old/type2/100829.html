Subject: fall/winter North Carolina oil

Hello all,
I know what any mention of what weight oil to use can do.
So I apologize in advance.

But, I just moved to NC and am not familiar with the fall winter temps here.

So, I am looking for recommendations for which weight to use during the
fall/winter months in and around Chapel Hill, NC in a 79 westy with a rebuilt
engine. I am currently using 20-50. This is my daily driver and I like to
drive a lot, with occasional road trips.

Also, I plan on taking the bus on tour this Nov. The tour will be mostly on
the east coast, with one night in Chicago. Should I be using something
different during this time? Anyone else going to be doing any of The Other
Ones tour?

Thanks,
Kyle
79 Westy

ps the horn only worked for 3 days. Then it blew the fuse again. I have to
disconnect it to get my taillights back again. a couple people asked me how i
got it working. It isn't working anymore so I can't really tell you. Sorry.
