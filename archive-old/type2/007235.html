Subject: Re: hard starting when warm('71 westy)

&gt;howdy!
&gt; I just got back online and bought that camper I've been eyeing, and
&gt;now as expected I have questions upon questions...Thanks in advance, 
&gt;let me know if you folks get tired of my dumb questions. :)
&gt; I had to put another engine in her for now to get her moving, and I 
&gt;can't quite seem to iron all of the bugs. The major problem would be
&gt;this: I go to start up in the morning and all is well, half a crank
&gt;on the key and it fires up and idles smoothly, but after running for
&gt;a while and warming up, she won't start. If I let it sit for a while, 
&gt;then she'll fire up okay, but not immediately. The engine in question
&gt;is a 1500cc with a 30pict3 carb and a mechanical type distributor. (I 
&gt;plugged up the vacuum hoses from the carb. Hopefully well enough) I 
&gt;checked the valve adjustment this morning before running as when she 
&gt;gets warmed the engine tends to miss some but all seems good there. 
&gt;.006 all around. Also, the choke seems to be functioning properly. 
&gt;Those were my two best guesses. Any sugestions?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks again,
&gt;Matt

  Matt, for one thing, they all have that to some degree if real
 hot. It is conjectured that fuel in the carby and even in the line 
 vaporizes giving a kind of vapor lock. I'm not so certain on that
 one but I have found that the timing can be the cuplrit. It's just 
 a minute difference between what starts good cold and won't start
 hot. Try retarding the spark a degree or two.          west
