&gt; Since your garage is tight enough to consider heating it, it is tight

&gt; another behind and off to one side.  
&gt; 
&gt; Random Thoughts:

some more random thoughts, I have used these things

put newspaper under the can.
turn on the heat for a few hours before using then turn off before turning
on the fogger

take heed, they will stain
&gt; 
&gt; I would not put one under the bus nor would I put one under the open rear
&gt; hatch.  They do spray up ~6-8 feet, so you can get staining if there is
&gt; anything above them at a lower height.  
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know if it would be better to have the heat going or not... I
&gt; would tend to heat so the beechos were active, but there is a slight fire
&gt; danger.  
&gt; 
&gt; Having a fan on to circulate the vapors would probably be a good idea.

don't use a fan, they advise not to and it dilutes the fumes too fast
&gt; 
&gt; I would *not* be present!  Do it just before you go to bed and re-enter
&gt; after work the next day.

for sure!!!!
