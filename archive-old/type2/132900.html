Subject: Brand New Heat Exchangers, Need Heads, Trade?

Hey Volks,

I have a set of brand new, never used Dansk Heat Exchangers, Headers,
Muffler and all the bits of tin for the heating ducts for a 78 bus. I need
heads pretty badly, one of mines got a crack and I don't have the money to
buy them. If anyone would like to talk about an exchange of some kind please
shoot me an email.

Thanks,

Giles
