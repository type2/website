Hi Volks- The '71 parts bus that I just got has a perfect wood headliner. I
would like to remove the front section and install it in my bus. Never
having done this before and not finding any info in the archives, can anyone
give me some advice, tips, information ,etc. so that I don't screw up the
headliner pieces during the removal and installation. I'm only doing the
section over the front section. As always, TIA TBear
