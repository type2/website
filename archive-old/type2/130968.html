Subject: Re: [T2] Continued AIRS drama/Nashville TN

&gt;I'm suspecting the thrust surface or main is worn bad enough
&gt;to cause the rods to bind on the crank when the clutch is pressed.

This doesn't make sense to me. That night I made sure that bus wasn't in 
gear and I pushed/pulled on the pulley for endplay and I didn't notice any.

Am I doing the test wrong? Why would it not have endplay then but it does 
now?

Are you thinking he can't even try to limp home on this engine? :(

Daniel
