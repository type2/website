Subject: New CV Boot Rotton!

While I was dropping my engine today I noticed the CV boot I put on last
summer looks like its 30 years old!
Not just a little crack but huge dry rot cracks and large openings. I got my
boot from RMMW last summer. Is this normal? It was only $16.00 - came with
grease and hardware- but my gosh! one year!
