Subject: Re: [T2] No Quarter on the list

NQ, don't listen to the nay-sayers! If you pay retail for everything, and I
never do, you will possibly have 2 grand or better in an engine, T-4. BUT the
alternative is like you said, less power. Also, you paid almost 1500 for that
Bug motor, done right. I am now in the process of rebuilding several sets of
1700 heads, and fly-cutting them for 2.0L. With Manley 1 pc. stainless valves,
silicon/aluminum/bronze valve guides, properly tentioned valve springs, a
3-angle valve job and glass-beading, they will cost me about $110.00 per head,
until I get my own Souix grinder! Then, $78.00/head! I refuse to pay the really
exhorbitant rates some machine shops charge for essentially scut work, as there
aren't mant machinists out here who sprechen VW, anymore.I will re-use a good
std crank, micced out, and a cam and lifters that shows little wear, as the
three I now have from scrap engines. The oil pump I usually re4place with a
Mellinng cast-iron unit, as they last longer and can be sealed to the
duraluminum case easily. Other parts are replaced as needed. I built a stock
1700 motor for a lady who immediately drove it to Chicago from S.C. and had no
problems with it(single center-mount DFev weber!), and drove it for seven years
after that, only replacing the front/rear seals and thr push-rod seals at 35k
miles. No new cam, only lifters, rebuilt heads, new p/c's, all new bearings and
rebuilt rods. My cost:$487.00, hers was $800.00,
less than half of youur avg. shops charge(1987 prices).double that today!

&gt; OK I won't mock but I will say this.  To do a stock 2.0 right you will
&gt; be into about the following.  $300 for the P&amp;C's, you got em.  $200-$250
&gt; each for heads.  Personally I'd never use a rebuilt head as Reichert has
&gt; the new German and you could get them together for about $250 each
&gt; outright I figure.  Crank will be $75 or so after you get a core, rods $60
&gt; after you get cores, bearings $35 main, $30 rods, $12 cam.  Cam is
&gt; going to be $75 for a nice regrind, lifters $100, pushrods, rockers, etc
&gt; you need to find nice cores and clean up.  $60 for the gasket set, $40
&gt; for the oil pump, $10 for the rear main seal, $5 for the nose seal.  Then
&gt; you would need a set of the proper tin (a bit tough but Bus Depot had
&gt; new and they float around for much less.)  Nikki would get you a set
&gt; of exchangers for $100, $100 for a nice muffler, and then you need some
&gt; sort of induction which would be say $250 for a solid used Weber (ugh)
&gt; or about the same for a working FI setup, then $50 for a late FI gas
&gt; tank and whatever hassles to make that fit so the Weber is likely how to go.
&gt;
&gt; So to do it so it will last at least 75k miles or so, I'd figure $1000 in
&gt; parts
&gt; alone with your jugs to do JUST the engine after getting core stuff and
&gt; pushing $2000 by the time you find tin, induction, exhaust, rectify clutch
&gt; and bellhousing issues and anything else that would creep up.
&gt;
&gt; I've driven a number of 1776 early bays with engines built well.  Running
&gt; even a stock 34 PICT or certainly dual Kadrons they were about equal
&gt; heavier late bays and easily had 75k mile lifespans or better.
&gt;
&gt; Doesn't seem sensible to me, just one opinion.  A T4 doesn't get built
&gt; on the cheap.  And putting one into a non T4 bus just doesn't make
&gt; much sense effort wise for the benefits IMHO.  $2000 would build a hell
&gt; of a type 1 even in a new case, with hydraulic lifters, done right.
