Sean sez:

&gt;Get out the VOM, get the engine running, then turn the key off.  If engine
&gt;is still running, pull wire from ignition switch off of coil.  This will
&gt;kill engine, but then put VOM on that wire.  If you've got 12v, ignition
&gt;switch is bad.

Okay, tried it; no volts. Does this mean my double relay is frying itself?
Like I told you in an earlier p-mail Sean, I've gone through 2 double
relays in this bus and I'm wondering if there's a wiring problem that's
burning them up.

Thanks! Joe
