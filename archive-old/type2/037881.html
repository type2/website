Subject: Re: ideas to keep the bus

When I was younger and my family was into dune buggies, my dad had a valve
that mounted in the brake line.  If I remember right, you had to apply the
brakes then pull the valve up to lock them.  The valve was hooked into the
hydraulic system so no cables were involved.  Sand rails only have rear
brakes, and they normally remove the emergency brake cables and hardware, so
if you want a parking brake you have to do it through the hydraulic brake
system.
I've thought that this would be a great theft deterrent, one or more wheels
could be locked and if the valve was hidden somewhere a thief would never
figure it out.

I've thought that it wouldn't be too much work to route a brake line into the
cab or mount the valve by a wheel.
My only question is:  would this severely affect the life of the wheel
cylinders?  And can they stand up to extended periods of pressure?
