What scam??? Did those who buy, buy willingly. Over 98% positive dealings?? 
At a tiny margin??? That's not a scam, it's called marketing, sub titled 
under capitalism. Not unreasonable that lots of people find value in not 
searching the world for the best price, but accepting a reasonable value 
for proven performance via strait forward business and up front pricing and 
lots and lots of good reports. They earn their little margin by putting 
goods into the hands of those who think it foolish to spend time looking 
for &quot;cheapest&quot; and nipping things in the bud by giving a margin to someone 
reliable to insure a good result. Maybe 10% net earned by these marketers. 
Good value recognized by many consumers. I always assume a seller is 
marking up his costs. This is not a scam. It is pure merchandising, a sin 
evidently in your mind. Not in mine, when value is added.

If fools overprice the bid for an item on eBay, is it the seller's fault 
for tricking them with testimonials and graphics and FREE 
SHIPPING!!!!!!!!?????????
