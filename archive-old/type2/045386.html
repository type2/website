Subject: [T2] Dismantling Question/woe

Dear List,

    I have a 1800 that I am currently dismantling and have gotten to the 
pistons and their cylinders (heads are off).  Okay, now how do I get the 
Pistons out if the engine won't turn and #2 and #3 are half way in the 
block.  This is the first time I am attempting this sort of thing so take it 
easy on me.  I want to rebuild this Engine for future use on my 73 westy 
(blue).  Someone please help a Poor college student save this engine.

Peace

Yucel
