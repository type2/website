&gt;Actually, the piece is not &quot;Y&quot;,
&gt;it is &quot;U&quot;.  I have a 79 bus (federal
&gt;model).  apparently, this model was
&gt;only for the year 79

Sorry, Casey, I thought the '79 used the same system as the '78.

Nevertheless, $400 is a big chunk of money for that piece, new or used.

I would think that you could have your present pipe repaired for a lot
less than that.
