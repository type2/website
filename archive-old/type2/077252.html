Subject: Weber Kits &amp; 1 Custom Kit FS

Have for sale a Weber progressive kit custom configured for 1700cc T-IV
motored 72 T-II. It was purchased new as a complete kit. I ran it less than
1000 miles for less than one year.

I am a practicing maintenance/repair/restoration proprietor and have earned
my keep servicing Euro vehicles for the past 10 years, with a prior 20
years in consulting engineering. It took me perhaps 4 hours to make up this
perfectly functioning throttle arrangement, which had no reasonable
hardware in the kit to address. Will supply to purchaser of this kit
instructions for mounting and adjustment of this custom throttle hardware.

So, I paid $289 for the kit plus shipping, put an extra 4 highly skilled
hours and $10 parts into t-cable interface functional design, then $70 for
jets and emulsion tubes custom calculated for stock 72 1700cc, then more
time to install them. At my current rate, the kit, the improvement of the
throttle hookup to make it work properly, the jets and their installation
is a retail value of $629 time/money out of pocket. But for the washer
marks from mounting, the carb kit appears as new, and was fully cleaned and
base adjustments verified when making the jet swaps. It is ready to install
and make final running adjustments. You should plan on using new gaskets
and seals which are not provided with my kit. 

If you get a kit that has no better throttle cable provision than this one
had, then my price will save you a bunch of hours with the custom designed
interface my enhanced skills took 4 hours to get smoooooth full throttle
movement from the pedal. All with stock throttle cable unmodified and
adjustable to some 2 inches + or-, so will likely be found suitable for the
several different cable lengths used through the years on T-IV motored
T-II's. This hardware requires drilling 2 holes and setting 2 sheet metal
screws, then an adjustment of the pivioted ball bearing cable track for
custom perfect length. It both transfers the cable location to directly in
line with the throttle lever for a strain free full pull and precise
adjustment for length.

Know also that due to prior engine work the runners will fit a bit
differently oriented on different motors. Troublesome alignment issues with
the manifold and runners is not at all rare and will require a bit of
tweeking in many cases. You won't know how well any kit jig welded on a
spec motor will fit on a motor after the heads have been machined and or
pistons/cylinders replaced. It's the same issue that can crop up on muffler
and/or headpipe replacement making installation troublesome to difficult on
some motors.

If you want the quickest installation functional from the get go for 1700cc
T-IV motor in a 72 Bus, that's what my enhanced kit will provide. 

Know this. If the kit you buy is suggested to be suitable for use on all
T-IV motors from 1700-2000cc, it is in my professional opinion that no jets
available will work well throughout the range of needs of these different
displacements. Unless the kit is custom jetted for the size motor you use
it on, you will need a jet/emulsion tube change or it will either run lean
and boggy and hot or overrich with short plug life and poor fuel economy,
unless you get lucky. You won't know if it's an issue until you fire it up
and attempt final adjustments and then test drive it under load. 

I give no warrentees/guarantees. I do state with confidence that if I
installed this again on MY 72 T-II, it would run MUCH better than it did
when I had it on there with the jets that came with it, but such kits can
NEVER run as well as the stock dual Solexes or FI in good order and
adjustment. But they do run better when dialed in than worn out original
Solexes.

That's the facts. The only opinion I have is if you buy a kit without a
proper provision for relocation of the throttle cable, you should buy my
kit, unless you like to solve mechanical problems from scratch and find the
new knowledge and skills gained well worth the extra time spent. 

If $250 seems like too much for you, my regards. That price is firm, plus
shipping/ins cost to be determined when and if your zip code is known. Wild
guess??? Kit will weigh 15 lbs boxed 12&quot;X16&quot;X30&quot; or less and will ship from
98250. Do your own shipping est. at UPS_dot_com.

Cashier's check or money order only, please.

Will keep interested people informed when someone posts a payment, and item
is sold pending receipt of payment.

All offer or inquiries should be by p-mail.

Thanks,
T.P. Stephens
