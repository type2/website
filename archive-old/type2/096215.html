&gt; Just a little FYI:
&gt; The left rear corner on a 79 Cal version engine is one-year-only. It has a
&gt; large round hole in it that no other one has....
&gt; Unfortunately, I don't have one.
&gt; 

?????  mine had a round hole further forward where the pieces of tin
joined, you don't mean that do you.... I flattened a 100ft roll of film
can painted it black and bolted it to one side over the hole...found to
seal it completely I had to bolt both sides
