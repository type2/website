&gt;You can do your part to help the losers and winners of 
&gt;political races by assisting in the cleanup of the painted plywood 
&gt;and 2x4 signs and plastic cardboard for proper re-use or recycling.
&gt;

..but how many campaign signs are made of Baltic Birch plywood anyway? 

Seriously, a good idea, but inasmuch as these signs are personal
property (at least in AriDzona, depending on who's pulling up other
people's signs, but I digress), I'd be a little leery of being accused
of theft, especially of good re-usable plywood and metal fence post 
stakes.

But then again, I'm probably more than a little paranoid....
