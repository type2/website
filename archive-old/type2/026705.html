Subject: Help: tranny mount bolts stripped

Help!
I'm trying to get my tranny down from my 73 Bus (manual) before the snow
flies and am stuck by the rear mounting bolts not coming out and becoming
stripped.
Any tricks to getting those 2 nuts off if they are stripping?  I put some
penetrating oil on them and will let them soak overnight.  But now that the
17mm socket does not grip on, I'm not sure how to get them off (use a
slightly smaller size socket, maybe SAE? chisel them off?).  I'm leery to
use a torch to heat them up because of proximity of fuel tank and lines.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated as these are the last 2 bolts
required to take the tranny out.
Thanks.
  --Robert
