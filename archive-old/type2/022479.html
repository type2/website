&gt;&gt; There was a little nutty guy at the VW Auburn Hills show this past Spring

&gt;&gt; off.  Price tag without installation?  $5,000.
&gt;
&gt;Why does this sound outrageously high to me?


Well, if it is a professionally done installation, using only original VW parts 
and a factory new engine. It is dirt cheap, and still less expensive than the 
1776 I built for my single cab.
