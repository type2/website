Subject: Hint from Heloise: CV Bolt Removal 

OK.  Situation.

  I got the rear of the bus jacked way up off the ground, and I want to 
remove (just break free) the CV bolts.

  No human helper, and the brakes are torn apart (no foot brake or emergency 
brake).


  Well, I simply jam a suitable object between the tire and the ground, and 
loosen two or three bolts at a a time.  Unjam the object, rotate the wheel 
to the next set of bolts, and rejam  the object.

  For CV bolts on the other side of axle, the object must go on the other 
side of the tire, so you cannot loosen the CV bolts both ends of the axle at 
the same time.

  I have used a slab of 2x4 or firewood, a cinder block, and a couple of 
tires piled on top of each other, depending on how high I got the rear end 
up in the air.

  I also used a decent pry bar between the wheel bolts when a VW tire/rim 
was not available.

  So, no big deal.  Obvious, right...


  Yeah, you're right, no big deal, obvious, and . . . I'm  bored ! ! !
