Volks:

I went through the same thing with one of my Triumph sports cars.  Get thee
to your local Loews or Home Depot and grab a big ass roll of &quot;roofing
membrane&quot;.  This material is a rubbery stretchy self adhesive overlay that
is designed to prevent water and ice damage to roofs in the Northern half of
the country - get it anywhere in Canada... a 75 foot rool is about that many
dollars C$.

I picked this tip up on an autosound page where the author compard it
favorably to &quot;Dynomat&quot; at about $155,000 per foot.  If autosound guys use
it, why can't we?  In fact, one of the feature lings on the type 2 page had
a soundproofing article that used this as ONE of the layers, in addition to
insulation, expanding foam, heat barrier paint, and a small thermoneuclear
device (ha, just kidding).
