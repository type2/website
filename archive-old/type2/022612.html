hello list, 
i have a 79 automatic FI.  Last week my fuel guage started acting wierd,
when I get down to about a half tank of gas the guage moves down to way
past empty (so far past empty you can't see the needle). At first I
thought I somehow ran out of gas but when I put $5 worth in I had a full
tank (usually takes about $12 to fill it up). So lately when this
happens I just take note of the mileage and figure I have at least
another 50 miles before I'd need to worry about running out of gas
(probably a lot more than that).  Does this sound like a problem with
the guage itself or would it be the sender (?) in the fuel tank? I feel
too inexperienced to be tackling this myself (super-newbie here) but
would appreciate any advice and knowledge you have to offer.
thanks alot,
lisa- 79 bus
