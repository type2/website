Subject: Pop-Top hold-down improvements?! Ideas???
Message-ID: &lt;19990501040157.16635.rocketmail_at_web116.yahoomail_dot_com&gt;

All,

Ok, when I take my bus ('69 Westy Pop-Top) out on the
road, I have the same concerns as all ac VW owners: 

~Do I have all the &quot;right&quot; tools to deal with any
&quot;likely&quot; problems?
~Do I have all the &quot;right&quot; parts for the above?
~Do I have the skills to deal with the above?
~Will my bus have a catastrophic failure that the
above parts/tools/knowledge will fail to repair?

.....BUT.....

The one thing that bothers me the *most* when I travel
is the way the Pop-Top jumps, rumbles, clangs and
vibrates every time a semi passes or I get caught in
strong wind! I have this continuing fear that it will
open on me when I'm travelling a 60mph!

&quot;Irrational&quot;, you may say, but...

The reason that I have this &quot;irrational&quot; fear, is that
when I first bought this bus, the above *almost*
happened!!!! When I bought it, one of the (front)
rubber hold-downs was broken....I was driving across a
bridge and got hit with a strong cross-wind (on the
same side that had the broken hold-down, of course)
and it started to lift the top. I was only going about
30mph and was able to grab the remnants of the
hold-down and keep the poptop from becoming a sail...
When I later inspected it, I found that the metal
attachment (where the rubber hold-down slides into)on
the OTHER SIDE was cracked!! 

I had this piece welded and replaced the rubber straps
on both sides, but I still *really* worry when it
makes that sound (older Westy owners know the
&quot;sound&quot;!).


I'm currently thinking of adding another set of straps
to the front corners of my bus, but on the outside.
These are straps made for holding down Baja trunks and
are of a good quality, but I REALLY hate to change the
stock look of my bus. 

Any other ideas?

Oh yeah, the poptop seal is new and intact and
everything else in that area is as it should be.


Thanks,


Jaime
