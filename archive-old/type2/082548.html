I like this idea, but perhaps a less obvious method of revealing the
code would be an idea. If we came up with a naming convention, including
a code, and location, we could apply this in a discreet, but viewable
area. ie, in the engine bay on the crossmembersthat support the bed
platform. So say we use date of manufacture, 3 initials, and location as
our convention. You are at a lot somewhere and you see a nifty green
early bay. Like most bus owners you introduce yourself, and get the name
of the &quot;owner&quot; in return. &quot;you say gee bob smith, cool bus what year is
it?, can I see under the hood?&quot;, &quot;bob&quot; replies &quot;err, uh, a '69 sure take
a look&quot; .
So with your head shoved in the boot of this bus you look up and see a
plate with &quot;68AWN-ON&quot; which strikes you as peculiar as you are looking
at a &quot;69&quot; being sold by a &quot;B-S&quot; in &quot;MA&quot;.  You then know someone stole my
bus, drove it to Maine, and is trying to sell it. Without asking if you
can scrape away some undercoat!

Howdy all,

On the subject of identifying parts with stamps, etc.,
could one not also weld/rivet/etc a type2 tag
(engraved, metal) on a spot of the underbody, then
undercoat that?  If many people did this in a similar
place we would all know where to look.  It would
probably not be noticed by anyone not looking for it,
but it could be easily scraped down and revealed.
