Subject: Adhesive remover?

Anybody have any suggestions on what kind of ahhesive remover to use to take up 
all of the original sound deadening stuff in the rear of the 69 bus? Mine is a 
little worse for the wear and I've tried several things even this stuff called 
Goo Off. 
Also a good product to use to clean the seats. They are a light grey color and 
stained pretty good.
