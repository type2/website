Subject: Re: [T2] Shipping big, heavy bus stuff.

Find a www.forwardair_dot_com location near you. They are cheap 
but a tad inconvenient. You have to drop off and pick up at 
thier locations, and you can opnly pay by money order NO CASH 
and no credit cards.

That said, I shipped a pool table from Toronto Ontario Canada 
to LA California for $70 bucks... Fedex wanted Seven HUNDRED.

Thanks,
Chris
