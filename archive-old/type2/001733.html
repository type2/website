Subject: Re: [T2] '74 wiring harness

If you want new wiring, why grab a junker harness that could have as many
flaws as your old one if you're willing to spend for new anyway?

You could spend the effort to compare the 72 and 74 wiring diagrams and find
the differences, adding a few cables here or there to the 72. They can't be
terribly different for those years, both carbed, both bays, etc...

&gt; &gt; The main wiring harness in my project '74 Westy is in dire need of
&gt; &gt; replacement.  But the closest I can find in catalogs is for a '72.  Does
&gt; &gt; anyone have any experience in modifying the '72 harness?  Or are there
any
&gt; &gt; other alternatives?  The bus has a non-FI 1.8L.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks,
&gt; &gt; Darren.
&gt;
&gt; That's right, the aftermarket wiring specialists (like Wiring Works in San
&gt; Pedro Ca.) only make them for the earlier years.
&gt;
&gt; Find a salvage yard that has a good used one you can pull.  Check with:
&gt; www.interstatevw_dot_com their in Lakeside, Ca.
