Hello Listees:

Since the subject of sound deadening has been bounced around lately, I thought I'd throw in my $.02 worth on the subject of using real Dynamat or JC Whitney's version.

Typically, this stuff can be bought either in 1-foot square sheets or larger rolls.  Most people make the mistaken assumption that the whole 1-foot square sheet has to be used un-cut, or that the roll-sized material has to be cut to fit an area from edge to edge.  To save money, if you're applying the Dynamat to a large area such as a Bus wall or roof, cut the stuff into 4 x 4 inch pieces, and spread them out, leaving about 6 to 8 inches between squares.  The effect is probably at least 90% as effective as leaving the sheets un-cut, and you can cover a lot more area with the same amount of Dynamat.
