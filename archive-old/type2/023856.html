Subject: outer window scrapers leaking?

hi all,
in an effort to discover why the cab keeps filling (not litterally) with water
on rainy days, i have removed the trim panels.  Luckily it rained today and
water came pouring into the cab from the various holes in the door.  The only
cause i can think of is the outer scrapers being perished.

Should the scrapers be preventing water ingression or is there a seal
somewhere below the level of the window frame i havent seen?  outer scraper
sets seem pretty pricey so i hope its not the case. Any views?

thanks everyone
