&gt; I'm not a physics engineer, but I stayed in a Holiday Inn Express last

&gt; I was told that the fuel in the air being drawn through the intake
&gt; manifold absorbs heat, and because of its velocity draws more heat
&gt; than the manifold is getting from the engine.

That's half of the story.  When fuel goes through the carburator it
experiences a drop in pressure.  Due to Gay-Lussac's Law there is a drop
in temperature proportional to the drop in pressure.

If the air is humid, moisture may condense out below the carburator.
In the narrow range of inlet temperatures
where the temperature below the carburator is below freezing while the
inlet temperature is above freezing, the
condensed moisture will freeze and build up, causing what is called
&quot;carburator icing&quot;

In the VW, this is avoided by ducting exhaust gases through a separate
passage of the intake manifold and by providing a hot air bypass in the
air cleaner.  Many of those exhaust ducts are plugged and the hot air
bypass is often missing in currently running buses.

BTW, If the temperature is below freezing, you won't get icing!  Icing is
most likely with outside temperatures of 40-60F and high relative
humidity.  The only time my bus has iced up was when climbing a pass in
the Sierras in the rain.
