Subject: Re: [T2] Winter rustproof -- Rotisserie?

&gt; Would you all like a webpage made of ALL the pics I have of this thing?

I think it would be great to see some more pictures.

I've been considering building a rotisserie for my planned body
restoration.  I've been a bit concerned about using a rotisserie while
welding in new panels (especially structural ones).  How do you ensure
that you haven't introduced a twist into the body when it's suppored
only by the rotisserie, and it's tilted on its side?

Did you run into any problems like that with your setup?
