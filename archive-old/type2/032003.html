I love The Bus Depot!

Ron Salmon's Bus Depot has left me a very satisfied customer 3 out of 3 
times now. His prices on a wide range of VW parts are SUBSTANTIALLY 
cheaper than anyone else I have found. His turnaround on orders is 
typically quite speedy. His people have been quite helpful and 
informative when I needed information about country of origin and 
manufacturers of parts. As his business has grown he has developed a 
pretty slick online catalog and order system that I really like using. 

It's true that e-mail inquiries have gotten lost before, and that the
phone number is often busy when I call, but I've never seen any successful
VW business that didn't get really really busy. (For comparison, I'm STILL
waiting for that Bus Boys catalog I paid for 4 years ago.) But on my last
Bus Depot order I asked questions in the comment window of the order form.
I received answers within 24 hours and my replies were processed within
another 36 hours. 

I will vouch for Ron's good character as manifested in several years of 
type2 list posts. The integrity of his business speaks for itself.

Another satisfied customer,
Surfer Bob
1978 Westfalia, the surf/luvbus, running on an increasing number of Bus 
Depot parts as the years go by.
