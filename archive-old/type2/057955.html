Hi Volks
Just to say a big thanks for all advice on CV's (Sean Bartnik , Bob Hoover and
Mike Gensler and lots of other advice from the list)... this helped a complete
novice (i.e. me) service.. , change all the CV boots and grease etc, change
tranny oil , strip the carb., tune and other stuff ready for the trip. Did
just over 4000 miles with no problems at all--- even the mountains in the
pyrenees and overtook some cars towing caravans uphills !!! believe it... Went
from Dorset on the south coast of England up to the highlands in Scotland then
went off to France to the South and into northern Spain (great scenery,
beaches and sites in the mountains) with lots of great weather for camping...
did not book sites and loads around. Averaged 24 miles per imperial gallon (1
litre=0.220 imperial and 0.264 US gallon).
The list is a great resource--- (which I contribute to when I can !!! )
