Thom wrote about his cracked muffler.

I think that the main cause for the upper #3&amp;4 welds breaking 
out of a muffler is a not properly fitting muffler, either the
muffler is a little off, or the engine is slightly wider or 
narrower than stock, it will be under continuous stress and 
will crack around the welds eventually. Should one experience
this when installing a muffler you could either heat it and 
bend so it fits better or enlarge the mounting flange holes a 
little, but not too much.
