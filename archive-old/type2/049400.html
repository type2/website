Subject: [T2] water pouring in, windshield area rust holes, oh my!!!

Hello all,

Im assisting in getting my roommates westy ready for her big road trip and 
one thing I thought Id like to tackle is help seal up the area just below 
the front window, you know, where all the rust is?

Just below the window seal there are a bunch of really little holes, and im 
assuming that everytime it rains this is where all the water is coming in 
and puddling all over inside.

Any do it yourself tricks to seal this up, better than it is now anyway? 
Looks arent important on this bus, just functionality so if its ugly, but 
works, ill try it.

im still working on the heat thing, we are going to work on sealing the 
pop-top the best we can (the best we can given the seal isnt there!) and I 
think im getting the girl who owns this bus some thermal socks for 
Christmas. =)


Thanks for all the tips,
Chris, Kell, and Tre'
