But not to VWs or Busses.
My first VW (back in about 1983) was a '71 Westy.  We had it for about 10
years but sold it to a friend after the kids outgrew the cots.  Then about 3
years ago I heard about a sunroof bus that was being parted out.  When I
went to see it I begged the guy not to cut it up.  Its a '70 that came
without an engine but it has no rust.  The sunroof cables were missing but
I've managed to pick those up at junkyards.

I was able to rescue it for $200 and, after it sat for a year or so, I got
busy and scrounged up the few parts that had been stripped off of it in the
10 years it was off the road.  I had to find a shift rod, brake hardware for
1 rear, and a new steering column, a couple lights, etc.  I've been renting
an engine from a friend for 2 six packs a month but last month I took the
first step towards getting my own engine built.  I already had the case so
my next step was to get a 76mm crank and 88 thick wall P&amp;Cs.  I'm going to
build it up as a single port engine with Kadrons.

Then, a few months ago, I heard from a friend that his old Boy Scout leader
had a '71 sunroof Bus that he wanted to get rid of.  I went to look at it to
see what kind of parts it might have but, it too, is in too good a shape to
destroy.  So, my friend, Richard Troy, and I decided to go partners on the
Bus so we would have a backup vehicle to share.  Well, Richard has fallen in
love with it and calls it Goldie.  It, like mine, is also a rust free
California Bus but it is really complete.  It was supposedly parked 12 years
ago because he blew the muffler out and dreaded going through that hassle
again.  It has 77K miles on the engine and we are hoping to bench test it
this weekend.  We're also replacing all of the brake components, like I did
on my '70 last year, and the gas tank.  If all goes well, its maiden voyage
will be to the toy and lit show in L.A. a couple weeks from now.

Wait, I'm not done yet.  A couple weeks ago, I was helping another friend
move and he almost begged me to take a '69 Bus off his hands.  At first I
thought it might be a good backup vehicle for my wife's balloon delivery
business but the more I looked at it the more rust I found.  So I'm going to
part it out.  There are many good body panels (without rust), interior
parts, and glass available from this donor so let me know if you need
anything.
