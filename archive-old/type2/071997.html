Subject: Heater model question

I have a 1979 Westy, and it has what I am pretty sure is a factory mounted
gas heater.  It's located midway back, on the underside, and controlled by
the &quot;wind-up&quot; rotating knob.

Can anyone tell me what model (i assume from my limited knowledge that it's
an &quot;Eberspacher&quot;) this would be?

Also, it used to work when motor wasn't running; i.e. you could turn the
key on, wind it, and get heat while sitting idle.  This has stopped
working, and when heater is next used, (with engine running)  it blows out
black smoke for a while.  I need to get an idea what the problem could be,
before I take it in for service.

Thanks, all.


Roger
