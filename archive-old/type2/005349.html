Volks,
This past weekend I was heading up the Saluda grade on I-26 West towards
Asheville, NC.

Usually I crest going 45 or so...............this time was a much different
situation.

van started bucking and motor was really shaking violently left to
right...........huge huff of black smoke out the tail pipe........when eased
foot on the pedal, seemed to start to accelerate a little..............got
to the top in 1st gear 15 mph.

Got to exit 22, called a friend and fellow listee, who came out promptly to
be chase vehicle and help diagnose (thanks, man) at 3am, no doubt.

Everything seemed in order in the engine compartment.  Tapped on the AFM box
, and headed down the highway.   Did it once more, and never again.

Symptom is huge loss of power, rocking of motor, black smoke, and motor
wants to cut off.  Will not hold idle when doing it.

Any one been here before?  Can someone forward me the procedure to adjust
/clean the AFM?
