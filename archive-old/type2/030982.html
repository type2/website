two  there is a second one on the top.  I find it easiest to take out

&gt; (small gauge) that looks like it should connect to the solenoid, but it
&gt; doesn't show up on the wiring diagram.  Could this go to my Eberspacher

well the heater does have a wire to the starter, but it should be a good

&quot;kl 30&quot;  goes to terminal post 30 on the starter.
