Subject: Re: [T2] New VW Design Chief

I was just wondering how well our busses sold compared to other brands in the day?  And why VW doesn't think it's profitable to make campmobile-type vehicles anymore.  Have costs gotten so high that they've priced themselves out of the market?  I don't think so.  Just look at RV prices these days.  When I was in that nice campground in Gulf Shores, I had to laugh that most of those vehicles cost over 100 times what I paid for mine.  And I slept just as good as they did.  Some of them were no doubt over $200K.  I dare say there are more of our vehicles still running around than similar vintage vans of any other brand.  But did they really compete when they were new?  I'd be interested in looking at the stats.  Surely somebody at VW should be able to service a market they pioneered and turn a profit.  JMHO....KR
