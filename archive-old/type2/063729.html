&gt; I'm thinking about going to look at this truck. Guy claims 35,000 
&gt; certifiable miles. Sounds like the possibility of a show winner. Help me 
&gt; out, here:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. This should be a 36 hp, or a 40?
&gt; 
40hp

&gt; 2. If the bumpers are original they should, or should not, have overriders?
&gt; 
The US models had overriders.

&gt; 3. Panel van should have basically no interior, right?
&gt; 
Right, just grey paint in the cargo area

&gt; 4. Can you win any money at shows with a truck like this, or do you guys 
&gt; just do it to show off? ;)
&gt; 
ha ha.  Just show-offs I guess

&gt; 5. This is too late for a split-case trans, right?
&gt; 
Yes.

&gt; He's asking $6500. Once the Cruise Director talks some sense 
&gt; into me I imagine I'll share its location with the list. Groan.
&gt; 
Sounds *very* high to me (midwesterner), but then it does sound like a
good one.  8-)
