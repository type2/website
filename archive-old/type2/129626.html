And more. OEM parts for cars come from a variety of supplies, some of 
which supply the aftermarket (think &quot;Bosch&quot;).

Many aftermarket parts are rebuilt from cores.

Anything that is cast in aluminum, iron, potmetal, even plastic can be 
used  as a casting for a new mold. This is one way that specification 
errors accumulate, especially if you start adding generations of molds.

And some parts on the markets are outright piracy: made to look like 
parts but not designed to fit anything.
