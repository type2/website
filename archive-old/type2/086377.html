Hmmm,

I think BUStedBUS_dot_com might have an original one with the sweat vw emblem (I
really want it for a project bus but I will part with it if you really want
it) and a few nice metal after market one for $9.50.

Chris,

I'm not sure if the 71 is the same as my 73, but I found that some evil
previous owner had hammered up my filler spout pretty bad.  I had to
bend it flat and it sealed a little better.  I got a new locking cap
(Stant) and it sealed a little better yet (new sealing material) but I
still got some slosh-out on left hand turns.  That's when I got a
flashlight, don't use a match 8-) and found that there is a gradual
ledge that was bent over.  I used a paint can opener to grab the bottom
and bend it back into shape.  Now when I lock it down and twist a half
turn, it seals down nicely.

Take a look and see if yours is the same.  Also check the seal on your
cap.

&gt; Has anyone come up with a good replacement cap for a 71.
&gt; I can't put .5 of  tank without gas coming out of the filler.
&gt;
&gt; Also I just drop it off to have the generator done the pulley spilt in
half.  So looks that I will go with the alternator instead. Going to have
the clutch, hoses, electronic ignition, new engine seals.
&gt;
&gt; Hope this keeps her running for a long time the engine is strong.
&gt;
&gt; Is there anything the rest of you can think of while she a part that I
should have done?
