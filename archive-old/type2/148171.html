Subject: Re: [T2] High crankcase pressure problem after installing new
  carbs - dangling hose from breather box!?

Sounds like you need to install a nipple in one of the air cleaners to
accept that breather hose. Venting to the outside works if blowby is
low or the nipple on the air cleaner is too restrictive. Otherwise
last hope is a bugpack breather system (drill holes in valve covers
for vent tubes).

&gt; One challenge I had after the installation was what do with the hose

&gt; setup, which would no longer exist after the upgrade.
