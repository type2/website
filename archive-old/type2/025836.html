&gt; The original air-cooled Vanagons had 12 points, but anyone who has ever
&gt; taken the CV's apart replaced them with Allen heads, at least anyone with
&gt; any sense.  The chances are that virtually all 80 - 83 Vanagons have Allen
&gt; heads now, but there are certainly a few with 12 points.  Check before you
&gt; get started.

Allen heads suck. This may be a news flash to &quot;anyone with any sense,&quot; but
IME the odds of rounding out an Allen bolt are at least treble those of
rounding out a 12-point.

And also, IME, the Allen wrench stubs you need to turn an Allen bolt with a
torque wrench are very, very soft. OTOH, the 12-point driver I use is very
durable; I've pulled a lot of CVs with this driver and never rounded out
one.

Back to the original question...faced with some CV bolts not even a genuine
vise grip would turn, no welder and no need to keep the bolts intact, I just
ground off the heads with an angle grinder and pulled the CV right off the
stud. After it was off and the CV was cool, you can turn them out with your
fingers if you'd like.
