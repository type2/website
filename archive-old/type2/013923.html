Subject: Re: [T2] #3 cyl not pulling its weight



&gt; I discovered a disturbing fact the other day.  My #3 cyllinder is not
&gt; contributing to the engine's power.  When I pulled the spark plug wire off,
&gt; the rpms did not change, whereas doing this for the other cyllinders slows
&gt; it down and makes it rough.  Engine does not run rough when the other three
&gt; are firing, although there is a little backfiring on decel.
&gt; 
&gt; I ran the engine with the #3 plug out, and it appeared to be sparking ok.
&gt; plug was not fouled.  I smelled gas in the air coming out the spark plug
&gt; hole.  Any guesses as to what the matter is?

many distributors retard the #3 spark to keep that cylinder cool.  The spark is probably arriving too late for #3 to contribute to idle power, 
although it is probably firing.  When the distributor advances, #3 will take up its share of the load.

Try the same test at, say, 2000 RPM and you'll probably find that disconnecting #3 slows things down as it should.
