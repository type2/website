Not to start yet another tire thread, eh? but!

Check your book again.  It refers specificly to a 185R14, NOT a 185/70R14.
George will correct me if i'm wrong again here, but a 185R14 is a
185/82R14.  the second number (70 or 82) is the aspect ratio.  That is,
the height of the sidewall of the tire, represented as a ratio.

so a 185/70 is 129.5mm tall on the sidewall.  a 185/82 is 151.7mm tall.
(width * aspect ratio/100)

That makes a 185/70 44.4mm shorter overall then the 185/82.

So, you say?  Shorter tire=higher RPM per MPH...and the speedo will read
wrong also.

Also, 185/70R14 is normally a passenger car tire size.  I, for one, have
never seen one that carries at minum a C load rating...which is required
by your VW bus.  see the Bentley, the archives, and perhaps your owners
manual for proof of that.;)




At this, i'll stop.  For more info, search the archives at vw.i405_dot_com for
&quot;tires&quot;  ;)
