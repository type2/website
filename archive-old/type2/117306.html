Subject: Re:Replacing Valve Guides

Hi Mike,
	Actually what y'all are looking at and fondling are push rod
tubes.  If you were noticing oil dripping on the ground leaking out of
your &quot;valve guides&quot; things would have been a bit more interesting.

The key with keeping those seals drip free is to clean both the sealing
area on the tubes and the corresponding areas on the head and block
PERFECTLY.  I carefully scrape all crud off with a posicle stick (dont
damage the sealing surface) then get up in there with a mirror and piece
of rag, held with some tool (hemostat works well for me).  I clean the
surfaces using carb cleaner and scrub till they are perfectly clean and I
can see all areas ARE clean.  Ditto for the grooves on the tubes, although
being steel, one can get a bit more agressive there i.e.  Scotchbrite or
wire brush to start.  I think the original design is good and sealers are
not an improvement.  Viton rings seem to work best. Plenty of excellent
R&amp;R advice in the Type 2 library. jon

ps if you do this and they are still leaking, then Dr Tim's advice to look
elsewhere for excess crancase pressure is, IMHOP, the sensible route for
diagnostics. j

snip)
        I just got back from a 400 mile trip and now my valve guide
tubes are leaking. I know this is normal for a bus, but I just reworked
them about 3500 miles ago with all new rings (all 16 of them) and they
were all set in and not leaking.
