Subject: Re: [T2] cv dished washer

&gt;From: Harry Hoffman

&gt;Speaking of &quot;dished washers&quot; used heads clean up very nicely in a dish 
&gt;washer :-)
&gt;I cleaned a set of heads that I got in a junkyard in WA state serveral yrs 
&gt;ago in the dish washer. Just talked with the current owner and the bus is 
&gt;still running well, don't know the how well the dish washer runs.


What kind of soap, detergent, degreaser, solvent, etc. did you use in the 
washer? I have been thinking about this for some time. I have been thinking 
about finding one and replacing the pump with a parts washer solvent grade 
pump.
