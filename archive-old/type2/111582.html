Subject: Re: [T2] Non Starting Bus Advice by HSD

&gt;&gt;The link is:
http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/098182.html&lt;&lt;

that is a great &amp; truly useful article.

i was wondering, as a kind of guide to go along with it,
does anyone have a list of all the tools that would be 
needed to complete the procedures listed?

or i guess an easier answer - what would be the &quot;Muir equivalent&quot;?
(ex: Phase I, Phase II, etc.)

i would like to get all of the necessary ones together &amp; make
sure i have them in the bus(es).

TIA,

Joel Wilson
