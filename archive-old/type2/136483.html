Subject: Re: [T2] once upon a pre-owned tuna can

Well, he just purchased an underpowered square
vehicle that gets 17-19 mpg.  It is generally
considered unattractive (and thus is cheaper than
most suvs), seats 7 and has a bed (though not
nearly as nice as a westy bed).  Not a VW bus for
sure, but it's waaay more similar to a bus than a
Golf or Jetta.  Yet, I doubt that anyone would
bust his chops if he purchased Golf, Jetta, or a
Urovan.  

Personally, I think the Monty is a better choice.
  Hurry back soon when you have enough time and
cash to get a bus on the road.
