&gt; How about the Carter P4070 - anyone use that one?

That's the one I got. 4 - 6 psi and most sites I've found say to NOT use a
regulator http://www.racetep_dot_com/webfuelspark.html#webfuel

High volume, low pressure.

It cost me $79.99 locally. You will find you generally pay MORE locally
than mail order. The shipping costs bring the two prices closer together
but mail order will usually win out by $5 or $10 if you're willing to wait
for it. The P4070 can be had for about $59.99 mail order and figure about
$10 for shipping as it's not exactly a light package.

I can't really give a noise report because mine is on the Rivi in a 10x20
storage unit with every door, window, and hatch open on the bus. It sounds
LOUD in there -- but it's not the clattering loud of the Facet. In fact, I
can hear the hiss of it sucking air around the unsealed fitting threads
quite clearly &lt;grin&gt; Gotta fix that. It's not leaking fuel but I bet it's
blowing bubbles into my float bowls. ;-)

The metal bracket is also mounted right to the firewall. I will probably
need to isolate that with rubber mounts like the ones on the pump itself.
I'm sure the vibration is being amplified by the &quot;drum like&quot;
characteristics of the firewall/fuel tank bay combination.

I need to order some relays and wire it up to the oil pressure switch too.
I'm really uncomfortable with an electric fuel pump that runs when the
engine isn't turning.
