Hey all,
I always hear &quot;how much does my Westy weigh?&quot;

In Sunday's Washington Post in the Beakman &amp; Jax section in the comics, they
give a solution so that you can weigh the van without a scale.

George Lyle, you may want to comment on the accuracy of this method :-)

Here is the procedure, quoted from Beakman &amp; Jax:

WHAT YOU NEED:
Tire pressure gauge
measuring tape
2 pieces of cardboard with straight edges
simple math skills

WHAT TO DO:
The car must be parked on a smooth surface like a garage floor.  Put the
pieces of cardboard under a tire as in drawing 1.

(If the underscore _ is a piece of cardboard and the O is a wheel as viewed
from the side, you are taking the 2 pieces like so _ -&gt; O &lt;- _  )

Push the cardboards as snug against the tire as possible.  Make sure they
are not crooked but nice and parallel.  Measure the distance between the two
cardboards.  Then turn the cardboards and repeat the whole thing as in
drawing 2.

(Here you are doing the same thing except measuring the WIDTH of the contact
patch and not the length as above.)

Multiply the numbers from both measurements.  That will be the area of that
tire's footprint.

Next, use the tire gauge to measure the air pressure of the tire.  Then
multiply the area times the pressure.  That will be the weight that one tire
is holding up.

MORE STUFF TO DO:
Repeat this for all 4 tires and add the separate weights together.  That's
the car's total weight.

SO WHAT:
Air pressure is measured by how much weight it can hold up.  If you use a
ruler that measures inches and a tire gauge that measures pounds per square
inch, just multiplying them together will tell you the weight that tire is
holding up.

Kinda neat :-)
