&gt; Thanks for the advice all, it helps even with a moral boost. We are moving
&gt; aboard our sailboat in less than two weeks and my single cab still has no
&gt; interior, no drivetrain, still needs some dents taken care of and a paint
&gt; job. Once we move aboard I won't have shop space beyond the parking lot (and
&gt; they take a dim view of spray painting). So my blood pressure is a little
&gt; high right now. I can now plan how and when to put in the drivetrain with an
&gt; idea of how long to allocate for that job (adding 50% for good measure).
&gt; Surprising how long it takes to build a 40-year-old single cab...

not sure how things are where you are but locally when I didn't have a
space I rented an old garage was great for storing &quot;spare&quot; vw parts, a
place to work on the bus and if it was not residential I did not get
hassled for making noise at 6AM on Sunday morning etc.  just be aware of
the neighborhood if you plan on being there alone at night, visit before
signing the contract. and if you need power check that out, although a
generator and battery tools can be cheaper.

  don't even bother with commercial &quot;rent a space&quot; places they don't like
hanging around and working on your bus. but most newspapers have places
for rent like that, may take some time searching but locally (Baltimore)
you can find a full sized single garage for $75 per month, less if you are
6'6&quot; and 275lb fullback looking male, and don't mind the neighborhood.
