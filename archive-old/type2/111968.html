Subject: Orange '79 VW Bus in Boston, MUST SELL IMMEDIATELY

Please, if you're in the Boston area or even a few hours away,  make me a
reasonable offer and this bus is yours.  I don't have a picture for it. 
I'm stranded here in the east and am forced to sell my bus in order to get
back home to Utah.  I'm down to my last few few bucks and am desperate to
sell this Bus, so obviously I'm not going to be able to sit on it and get
what it's worth.  Whomever buys this bus will be getting a heartbreaking
(for me) bargain.  Are you the one to give my bus a good home?  If not, 
are you the one who will let me camp for a day or 2 while I find someone
else to buy it?  The only major mechanical problem is that it won't go
into 4th gear.  This is a western bus with not a lot of rust underneath. 
Generally solid bus.  My listing for this bus is here:

Desperate, broke, stuck on the East coast, home is in Utah,

Daniel

p.s. I have access to this computer until approximately 7:30 PM.  After
that and I may not get your message until tomorrow sometime when I find
other access.  Please email me ASAP if you're interested.  This is a
&quot;right place at the right time&quot; opportunity.
