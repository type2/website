I have found that vise grips with the concave jaws are better for 
round stock than the flat jaws. I have a pair that has sort of 
combination concave and flat jaw.

Yes, I highly recommend Vise Grip brand over the imitations.

&gt;Usually CHEAP vise grips slip off. I found out years ago that with vise
&gt;grips, you get what you pay for. I no longer buy any other than Vise Grip
&gt;brand. Even Craftsman are junk, but a lot better than the China/Taiwan crap.
&gt;Put the allen socket/wrench in the bolt head as deep and tight as you can.
&gt;Then put the vise grips on the head of the bolt and squeeze them as tight as
&gt;you can.
