Subject: Re: [T2] Gross Polluters

just because the air force and commercial airliners do more damage,
doesnt mean smoke bomb vehicles should be allowed to make it worse. dont
use the &quot;they're doing it, too!&quot; argument... sounds childish. just
because someone else is worse, doesnt make it right for anyone else.
pollution is pollution.

now i know that all old cars do damage to the environment, let's not
start that argument, but if properly maintained, it isn't unreasonable.
