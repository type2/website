Subject: idleing problems

here is the scenerio:

the engine is a  1600 dualport with about 50,000 miles
We just got a 34pict3 carb with a new vacuum advance distributer.  This was 
probably about 1500miles ago.  We have take 2 long trips since then to the 
mountains.

last weekend we went out to a short trip in oregon and had clutch cable 
problems which I think we've fixed.  We noticed we had to shift at a lower 
RPM than usual and I guess we had the cable adjusted to tightly and we 
backed it off a few turns.  We haven't been able to drive it really yet to 
see but I don't think this is related to my new problem.

After that trip it sat for a week.  we did a valve adjustment on it and then 
started it for a weekend drive and it wouldnt' idle.  it seems to run fine 
but when sitting in the driveway it keeps dying out and you gotta keep givin 
it gas.

Went back to the engine compartment.  Doesn't look like the carb is leaking 
and hopefully it is not that since we just go a new one.  It looks like the 
Distributer where it bolts onto the case is leaking??  Tightened that &quot;pinch 
bolt&quot; up and it seems like its stripped.  There is a little play when you 
wiggle the whole distributer(about 1/4 inch)

Would this affect idleing??

I assume my next step is to check timing but I have no timing light.  The 
plugs were just replaced about 1500 miles ago.

Do you think this sounds carb related or more towards timing.  turning the 
idle up doesn't matter as it will still die out after a short time.  I don't 
know much about carbs.  We have also checked for vacuum leaks to the best of 
our ability.

What do ya think?  If its carb related i'll just take it back to the shop 
for them to screw with since i'm sure it still has a warrenty....

Thanks,

Kim
