Subject: Re: [T2] 1 of 2 dual carbs whining at me bad

ok heres the lick./....
i went out this morning and just started over....
ok seems that the right carb did in fact have a leak where the bolts ,werent tightened as much as i should have of.... guessing this is why i lost power on my way home saturday...
everything bolted back down and all lines hooked up and with clamps on all... started up and i have more power now....
i have half a clutch before i can move now and the bus acts like it wants to pass out like its flooded maybe&gt;?
there is light black smoke coming out the pipe at any given rev not a idle or that can be seen.. 
cant remember black is to lean or to rich.. i was thinking rich..
thinking white was lean...?
 
sprayed carb spray round manifolds and etc... no cut back in engine....
ok on mixture...
i did the engine start up 2 1/2 turns from closed./..
turned the left one in about a turn and a half maybe started cutting back..
turned it back out half turn....
 
the right carb i turned it in about a half a turn and it started cutting back... so turned it back out the half turn..?
shouldnt they cut back at the same many turns..&gt;? or shouldnt they?
 
tried it the other way adjusting the right one first and then the left one and got same results..?
 
ok so happy no more birds in the carb,.... but how do i regain my power and keep the mix right and not to lean or rich&gt;?
with the weber progressive thigs were so much more simpilar than this LOL&gt;.
peace
chris

You have a vacum leak. Check where the carb bolts to the intake, there
should be a gasket there. It will cause your pop corn popping and lose of
power. If you have to, use some RV Sealant or similar at the carb base.
However if one is ok then the other should be fixable. Check all your bolts
and make sure everything is tight too. You could possible have a warped carb
(let's hope not). While you have it off check to make sure the carb base is
flat and true.

Good luck and let us know how they run when fixed.
