I concurr strongly with Eric (and Bob's earlier post on New York).  If I
am visiting a city and it has decent public transport, I try to park
outside the city and take the subway/bus in.  Here in DC surface parking
in the city is rare and restricted.  Public lots are usually under
buildings and many are less than the 6' that a bus needs. MOST are less
than the 6'6&quot; that a Westy needs.  Not to mention driving habits vary and
yours will be at odds with the locals, who will have no patience with you.

On a side note, I live just south of DC and have a spare parking space
behind my row-house.  With electric! less than (like 200'less than but
still :)  a mile for a subway stop!  I'd appreciate advance warning, but
if you are thinking DC, write me!
