John,
  The email was sent back to me as a failure, so I am
posting via the digest.  I apologize to all that will
see this as well, who don't need to read it.  

  It is solid but bent. (has a dent in the middle but
not big)  Could be fixable if you took the time.  You
want it, just let me know when you do... it is free,
just like the rest of the body.
  The bolts were rusted up so bad I kinda streched out
one of the bolt holes on the right side getting it
off.
  It is up to you wether you want a free bumper or
not.  Think about it a bit and then let me know if
paying for the gas here is enough for you.
  If you do want it, you can call me at (734)
973-6364.  I will be home tonight, please don't call
past 10pm if at all possible.  Or tomorrow, but I will
be in and out all day working on the buses.  I have
voice mail and am more than happy to call you back.
Thanks for the reply to the ad.
-Dawn
