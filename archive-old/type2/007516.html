With all the tire talk on both Lists of late, here are some important
points that haven't been mentioned.

1.	There's been a lot of talk about tire heights vis-a-vis engine
RPM, speedometer readings, etc.  The factor that is important in these
considerations is a given tire's _installed_ &quot;rolling radius&quot;.  This is
the actual distance between the axle's center line and the road surface
with the wheel/tire in motion.   Manufacturer's tire catalogs used to
provide this specification at various inflation pressures, but this
practice has unfortunately fallen out of favor.

Bear in mind that a tire compresses under load, and thus changes in load
and/or inflation pressure effect a change in rolling radius.  

Just because a given tire has a listed height specification that would
appear to be appropriate for a particular installation/application
doesn't necessarily mean the desired effect/result will be achieved.  The
number to use in engine RPM and speedo correction estimates or
calculations is the installed rolling radius.  Based, literally, on
&quot;where the rubber meets the road&quot;.....

2.	Tires that seem to fit in the wheel wells OK when a vehicle is
sitting immobile on a garage floor are often found to have
interference/clearance problems in actual use.  

In the front -- what happens when the wheels are turned full lock at
speed, then hit a sharp bump.  What happens under hard braking (thus
compressing the front suspension).  What happens when wheels are turned,
a hard bump is hit, and the brakes are sharply applied?  Think about this
very clearly and carefully, it might save some torn up sheet metal and/or
ruined tires.

In the rear -- what happens when the suspension is compressed by heavy
load or hard bumps?  What happens when the various tolerances in the
drive train and suspension allow the body to shift sideways in relation
to the wheels/tires in a hard turn?

3.	What happens when snow chains are fitted to the rear (front,
too, perhaps)?

Tires are expensive.  So is body and paint work.  Do the math and
homework _before_ you write that big check to a tire salesman whose main
interest is in getting you out the door to make room for the next
customer.....
