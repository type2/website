Subject: Re: [T2] Multimeter recommendations please

Prefect timing (pun intended ;-)

Actron is having a blowout sale on their Sunpro CP7676 Engine Analyzer
(Dwell, RPM, VDC, Ohms, Diode).

$79.99 retail reduced to $14.95 + $5 SH.  I searched around on the web and
this basic model was usually about $60-70 online.  It's new but they are
just reducing inventory because they have introduced new models.

RPM is read off the coil instead of via inductive pickup so there are only
one set of leads to hook up.  Personally I find this handy because I hate
plugging in two sets of alternating leads and the meters that have dual
displays are really expensive if you can find them.

Meters always seem to have some kind of compromise which annoys me. e.g The
mighty Fluke 88, a very nice automotive meter, doesn't do dwell, only duty
cycle so you have to convert the valve using a table. On on sunpro, the
compromise is that the RPM is rounded (875 RPM reads as 088 etc) but you
can't go wrong at this price.

This is what comes in the box:

It's only 5 inches tall.

Visit this URL below to find out more.  They have more items for sale
including another meter with more features.
