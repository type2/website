Subject: Re: [T2] dizzy rebuild was vac dizzy help....

I tried every combo possible. And I agree with you that the inner port is 
the advance but when I hook that to the drivers port on carb and leave 
retard open, the dizzy doesn't advance at all. Zero. Up the revs and the 
mark stays exactly where it is - and it won't even idle where it is supposed 
to very well at all.

A friend local said I should be able to suck on the hose on the dizzy and 
get the arm thing to move and it doesn't, at all so I think it is faulty 
somehow, hopefully it's just stuck (this sat for awhile). Is this correct?

Yes, it's a 34 Pict carb. And yes I read that article the other day and 
agree with what it says even though the samba forum people say it's the 
other way around.

Thanks for everyones help on this, I really appreciate the words of wisdom. 
I seriously hope I don't have to get a new vacuum unit, I found the one I 
need on busdepot and it's pricey (70 bucks). Ouch, might as well get one of 
those fancy vacuum ones that I keep hearing about.

&gt;And he apparently still has
&gt;the vacuum lines incorrectly attached.
&gt;Disconnect the retard, and recheck.
&gt;
&gt;That is a 34PICT carb, right?
