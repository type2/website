Subject: Oil Screen Screw - 2L motor

I've got a 2L with the center screw holding the plate and oil screen in
place - my bus came with the while silicon gaskets - it leaks.

Based on many postings and what I've read, I don't want to tighten the
single nut too much.  I'm also concerned that the PO or their mechanic may
have already tightened it too much and have cracked the case.

I've purchased a in/lb torque wrench that I can set to 108 in/lbs (9 ft/lbs)
- but before I proceed I'd like to know, if possible, if the case is intact
or not.  Does anyone know of a way to check this without opening the case?

TIA,

Wayne
