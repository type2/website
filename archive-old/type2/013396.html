Subject: fuel leak... should i be worried?
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

so i noticed that when i add gas a small puddle of
fuel forms under the the passenger side rear tire. i
still have half of tank of gas in there so it doesn't
seem to leak once the gas is in the tank only when
it's on the way to the tank. 1) am i right in assuming
that it's the pipe/tube thingy which delivers the fuel
to the tank that is leaking? 2) how do i check such a
thing? besides the fire factor, i can't afford to
waste gas with these california prices.


have a great day,

tesa
