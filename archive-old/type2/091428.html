Subject: backfiring muffler

Sorry not to respond sooner since I just cured my
backfiring... I had a persistant backfire (the bus had
&quot;sneezing&quot; fits when I went down grades in gear).

The poor quality bug muffler the P.O. had on the bus
had tiny holes on the welds even though it had very
little mileage on it

. When i switched over from a bug muffler to a German
bus muffler last month--NO MORE SNEEZING.

The downside is that I can no back up on my tire ramps
without bending the tail pipe.
