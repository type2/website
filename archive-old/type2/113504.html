Subject: Over Torque was: Compression test

&gt;The reason IMHO that there is such a problem with people stripping out plug
&gt;threads is that too often the plugs are over torqued in the first place. I
&gt;am not sure what Bentley spec for plug torque but I would bet most plugs
&gt;are in there with twice as much. They just simply don't need to be that
&gt;tight.

Without question, the most serious error of DIY'er is over tightening of 
fasteners and plugs and threads. Both the spark plugs and drain plug use 
forms of crush washers. They are designed to be used multiple times by 
being crushed just a bit further each time they are torqued. You must learn 
to feel the crush of the washer. If you come up hard and fully crush the 
washer, you are way over torque. For plugs, try this. Torque to 10 lbs. 
Then put on your ratchet and take it 30 degrees further by hand and learn 
that feel. Standard 3/8&quot; drive tools are best for these big, fine aluminum 
threads. They don't have to be tight enough to make the eagle grin, just 
snugged.

If serviced properly, plugs are easy to pop loose hot or cold and can be 
removed and reinstalled the full thread length by finger power only. 2 
drops of very light (3in1) oil on the threads is superior to any other. I 
say NEVER anti-seize spark plug thread. So many times this is done after 
the threads being stressed and is an attempt to fix a problem that nothing 
but a thread cleaning tap might fix. It does dry and harden in the threads 
in this application, more especially the aluminum based types.  Light oil 
will change torque only very sleightly and is very low in carbon content. I 
use the very same light oil on wheel studs, nuts and bolts. Insures clean 
consistent torque and free spinning fasteners.
