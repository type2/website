Subject: Side reflectors for 66-69 bus available

After repainting my 69 bus, I have side reflectors available.  Rather
than toss them, I'll offer them to anyone who needs them.

(1 ea) amber	211 945 555
gasket for above 141 945 559

(2 ea) red	211 945 555

Parts are in pretty good condition, but not perfect.

$5 postpaid to your door.
