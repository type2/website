Subject: Re: [T2] Call for obsolete rubber parts!

From Old Volks Home:

These have been a bitch of late to get outa Europe, almost for the past year they've only been available
through a VW Dealership that exports and they don't give 'em away (price very high for the qty we buy and
sell).  The major exporters themselves don't wanna mess with small parts like this, so they're cutting them
from their programs.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Now I am confused. I walk into my local dealer, order them, and get them overnight.  They cost me around .65
each.

I just did a check on part number 211 611 833 C and these 5 dealers in a 300+ mile radius have them in stock.
As of today, the number in front is the amount in stock:

      2 KIMBALL VOLKSWAGEN

      6 VOLKSWAGEN PASADENA
      PASADENA,CA 626-577-0300  26-OCT-05  202 miles

      10 TIMMONS VOLKSWAGEN
