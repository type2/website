Hello listmembers,

I have officially ran into the first problem with my new bus that kept me
from being able to even get it home.
Yesterday I drove all over the city running errands, and everything was 
running wonderfully. Then, as I left my house last night it was really hard 
to start, it would initially fire then die instantly. I got it going and 
drove down the road a while, but it would keep puttering and backfiring 
along the way, so I stopped. Then it would not even run for a little bit if 
I gave it gas when it would fire, but she would just die instantly anyway.

Warning, novice comments ahead :

So, I did what I could at the moment, in the dark anyway. I checked the plug 
wires, and the distributor cap, and all of that was still perfectly solid.

I am not sure where to start, and will be pulling out the Muir book for some 
guidance, any suggestions would be appreciated.
From what it is doing, I am guessing that im not running on all 4 all of a 
sudden, but im in the dark as to how/why it would have happened, and how 
major this is going to be.

So the race is on now besides, the bus is stuck at my house (after towing it 
back there) and I have to get from SF to Bend OR on thursday.

Should be interesting.......
