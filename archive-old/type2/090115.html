&gt; If you'll tell me how much you paid for the

I'll assume this means anyone :)

I bought a pair of YKS SV-820 tires for the rear almost one year ago
today. These are Korean tires which after 20k miles still seem to be
holding up very nicely. they are 185R14C tires with a load range of D
and a max load of 1875lbs at 65psi. I have been very happy with these
on the lower end of the tire spectrum. I bought them for $69 to which
included mounting &amp; balance. These tires are what the local post
office puts on their rural delivery trucks. Might be worth asking the
local post office who whey buy their tires from &amp; start there. I do
not belive these tires are as nice as the Michelin (from prior M-tire
experience) but they have a decent tread design &amp; are quite stiff. The
only thing I don't know is the 8 P.R. located after the 185R14C size.
I assume this might stand for 8-ply, but not for sure. Worth looking
into &amp; nemo can add it to the page. DOT# is 8ERK (factory in Korea)
