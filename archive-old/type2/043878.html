&gt;Also, any advice or &quot;must dos&quot; for putting a motor back in would be most

&gt;to line things up w/a screwdriver, but I'm not sure I could intuit my way
&gt;thru' it.

This is really nothing to be afraid of at all, for about the last ten
engine pulls I've just put the clutch pack on finger-tight and lined the
clutch disc up with my fingers. I can never find the stupid plastic clutch
alignment tool so I gave up looking for it and it's no loss, you can
eyeball it easily.

This was on a Type I but I can't believe a Type IV is any different. Could
be wrong. =^ )
