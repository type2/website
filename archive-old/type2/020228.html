&gt; Hey y'all
&gt; With the cold weather here in the Carolinas I have had the opportunity to
&gt; experience 3 (that's right, 3) blown oil filters.

In the mid-70's, I installed a full flow oil filter on my Type 1.  The first
cold morning, I started the engine and heard a ploop!  Regular oil filter split
at seam.  I found I had to use Fram HP-1 filters to keep from blowing filters
out. I have not blown a Fram HP series filter even when using a larger oil pump
and high pressure relief valve springs.  Now, I only use stock size oil pumps
and stock relief valves.  I still only use the Fram HP series filters though.

To give you an idea of the range of synthetics,  Redline makes a 15w - 40 wt.
oil.  And some new cars specify a 0 - 30 wt (non-synthetic) oil.
This response was only given for Dave's information.
This is neither an endorsement nor denouncement of the use of synthetic oils,
multi-grade oils, or straight weight oils.

Keep smiling,

Mike D.
