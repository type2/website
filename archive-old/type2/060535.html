&gt;And your carb linkage will now interfere with your alternator body in 
such
&gt;a way that the throttle will stick open (bad thing &lt;tm&gt;). I've heard 
that
&gt;there is such a thing as &quot;alternator linkage&quot; and this makes sense if 
the
&gt;alt was standard on any carbureted Type Is, but I've never seen it. You 
can
&gt;clearance the alternator case (which is what I do) but it's sort of a 
pain
&gt;in the ass. However the alternative is grim. 8)

I found this out the hard way.  The new 34 PICT-3s that are sold come 
with the accelerator pump linkage set up for a car with a generator.  
Well my '74 Ghia has an alternator, of course.  My first clue that 
something was weird was that I didn't seem to have full throttle.  Sure 
enough, the alternator casing was blocking the throttle from being 
opened all the way due to the accelerator pump linkage on the right side 
of the carb (as installed).  I guess it could cause your throttle to 
stick open if you REALLY jammed on it to get it wedged in there.

Anyway my solution was to pull the new carb, then swap the accelerator 
pump adjustment linkage (which is what interferes) from the original 
carb to the new carb.  it fits fine, and hopefully does not cause any 
operational problems.  Probably beats clearancing the alternator, unless 
you happen to not have around a spare 34 PICT-3 for an alternator engine 
:-)

Anyway, the Ghia still runs poorly, so I'm still working on it.  I guess 
next step is to remove the entire intake manifold and replace both the 
manifold boots (which appear to be in fine shape) and the gaskets 
between the manifold and heads.  Do you have to remove the alternator (I 
hope not) to remove intake manifold on a 1600 DP?
