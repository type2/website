Subject: diagnose this one

The Folly used to run fairly well although I knew she needed her Solex
carbs &quot;tuned&quot;.  Recently she has developed a problem whereby she would
run but had no guts.  Plus she was dumping gas into the oil.

I recently changed the oil... and as I had a spare carb, I transposed
the &quot;readings&quot; from the spare to the  Folly's 1700CC Type IV motor. &lt;
left hand carb, FIF &gt;

I thought that the &quot;transposed&quot; settings would be better than what I had
set up... and by the way, months ago I'd cleaned and rebuilt the carbs
that now sit on the engine.

Here's where things get strange... One day I was working on the 88 westy
while Folly's engine was idling.  I figure running the motor was good
for the carbs...   and just for fun I tossed in a small can of carb
cleaner.   While I was puttering away on the 88, all of a sudden,
Folly's engine came roaring back into life!  She idled better and had
her power back.

A week later I started her again and again she was back to no guts and
lousy idle.   I had some spray carb cleaner this time... gave the mouth
of the carb a toot.... and bang, she was great again!

So WHAT'S THAT all about ?   Any ideas???

Barry...

The Folly  72 Westy...
