Subject: Re: [T2] Brake squishyness

Jules,

I was referring to a seal internal to the master cylinder - the one on the
piston. Unless you have a rebuild kit and have rebuilt brake cylinders
before, do not bother about this seal but opt for a new master cylinder.
However, if rear brake adjustment helped so much, your m/c is probably good.
I assumed that you were seeing these symptoms despite properly adjusted
brakes.

Booster: pull the vent (the hose that disappears into the wheel well) and
insert something soft and flexible (you do not want to damage the diaphragm)
that you can use as a dipstick. A pieces of windshield washer hose should
do. You could also use this hose to siphon out any fluid that may have
accumulated. Be careful: you maybe siphoning rusty water or brake fluid -
both do not rank high on the list of gourmet beverages.

Marcus
