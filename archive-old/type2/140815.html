Subject: Re: [T2] tie rods

Kevin said:


 Hey, guys.  I'm going to have to replace a bent, adjustable tie  rod.  Kay at BD says she shows that it goes
on the driver's  side.  But I'm pretty sure the picture in Bentley ( Chap. 2, Pg.  3) is from the back looking
forward and shows it on the passenger  side.  Mine is definitely on the passenger side.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Even cip1 says the left side is adjustable:

And in the text for the right side:
http://www2.cip1_dot_com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=VWC%2D211%2D415%2D802%2DF

it says:
The right side tie-rod originally came as a fixed ( non-adjustable ) tie-rod. The adjustment for your front
suspension was enabled by the left side tie-rod which was adjustable. Some suppliers now substitute an
adjustable version right side tie-rod in place of the original fixed type. Either will work perfectly and
therefore when you order this item- it may come as adjustable or fixed. We can not specify which you will
receive but most of the time you will get the non-adjustable ( fixed ) style.

Strange.......
