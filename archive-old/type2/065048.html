Hi folks,

I like David's idea for the indoor/outdoor thermometer.  I received my Radio
Shack flyer yesterday and it's on sale around here for $9.99, too.  Looking
through the Mouser catalog that came in the mail with it, I notice the
digital thermometer IC alone is selling for $8.50 so here's one case where
Radio Shack provides a good deal.

I just have one nitpicky question before I plunk down a whole $9.  Since I
live in a colder climate I'm wondering how cold the LCD can get before it
will freeze up/break.  Our rabbit has a digital display clock that has never
worked correctly and I recall using a cheap dashmount digital display clock
in my old bus that would &quot;go south&quot; in the winter.
