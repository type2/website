Subject: Re: [T2] painting a pop-top

I'm think I should paint my pop-top, but I haven't seen (or at least haven't
noticed) the &quot;comprehensive&quot; discussion about how to do this with the
pop-top in place.  My assumption is that removing the pop-top is not a
trivial matter and for most folks will do the painting with the top still on
the vehicle.

So:

Best to completely remove all the seals before painting?

What about the bolts that are visible on the outside of the pop-top?  Mine
are all rusty and I'd like to replace them, though I may not.  Paint right
over them?  Remove them, paint, then reinstall bolts?

If somebody has the comprehensive step-by-step procedure for painting the
pop-top in place I'd sure like to see it!

TIA.

&gt; Jason... $20 or so will get you a quart of Interlux Premium Yacht
&gt; Enamel at your local marina or quality hardware store. Accept no
&gt; substitute. This stuff goes on beautifully with a brush or roller and a
&gt; quart will cover the roof twice with enough left over to coat the
&gt; bumpers to match. Mission accomplished. Even though it's brushed or
&gt; rolled on, it smooths as it dries and the finish looks excellent and
&gt; wears extremely well.
