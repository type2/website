LOL Johns whinnying again and as everyone knows he overcharges for them  
parts he sells so he has to down anyone else that sells parts. 
 
Hey John its been well over 5 yrs now and I'm still not in jail. in fact my  
business is growing fast due to my great reputation for getting the jobs done  
right. and as far as everything else maybe you should try to get your facts  
right.
