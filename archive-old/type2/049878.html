Subject: [T2] Must a '71 tranny swap come from another '71???

After installing a new Brazilian longblock in my ‘71
Westy in Fall 1999 I noticed a grinding noise that
wasn’t there before. It started on the same day I
installed the new engine. Thinking that the (new
German Sachs) clutch release bearing may have been
installed incorrectly (as was the list at the time) I
dropped the engine, removed and cleaned all of the
clutch components and reinstalled them. Well, the
noise was still there. But the bus drove ok, so I
continued to drive it until one day in the Summer of
2000 when the tranny just started acting up. When I’d
put it in reverse, it would go about 10’ backward and
then just come to an abrupt stop and go no further.
Going forward would be jerky. 

Now I’m trying to determine what my options are. I
could buy a remanufactured tranny from a reliable
central Oregon VW/Porsche tranny rebuilder and have it
installed here in Portland. I'm inclined to do that
because I've bought one for a beetle in the past and
it performed well. I could also buy a junker ‘71 Westy
and use it’s tranny. Or I could have mine rebuilt. I
guess my main question is, if I use a tranny from
another Westy, must it be from another ‘71, or are
there other years that had the same tranny? Also, how
can I tell what year vehicle another tranny originally
came from if it is out of the vehicle when I buy it?
Are there numbers stamped into it like the engine
numbers? What kinds of things do I need to look out
for?

Many Thanks.
