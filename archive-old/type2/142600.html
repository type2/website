&gt;Hi all,
&gt;Has anyone attempted an engine swap of this nature? Type 1 engine into a bus 
&gt;using a type 4 motor? I've heard that it can be done, just curious.

The factory shipped 1600cc engines in the buses all the way up until the model ended its lifecycle in 79.

You just need the tin (or fiberglass replacement) and a suitable engine mount with appropriate case that accepts the mount.
