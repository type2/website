Subject: Re: [T2] rubber valve cover gaskets??
Date: Sun, 24 Sep 2000 00:02:28 -0700

[...]

Fel-Pro used to make some really nice neoprene valve cover gaskets.  They
had one smooth side, and the other side had a series of parallel ridges and
valleys.  Much like the valve/cam cover gaskets for typical FWD econoboxes.

I had a bunch of them stashed for years, and finally used them all up.  I
haven't found any more for several years, so they may have discontinued
them.  They sealed exceptionally well, and could be re-used many times.
They had enough &quot;give&quot; and &quot;squish&quot; to tolerate even warped valve covers.

If anyone has knowledge of a source for these gaskets, or information as to
their production status, I'd appreciate an update.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Does anyone use these?  I just changed my covers using rubber ones and
one side is leaking.  I am leaning towards soft springs, but I was wondering
what the general concensus is on rubber versus cork.  &lt;&lt;
