&gt;Why install a whole alarm, though?  Just put in the flashing red light!


yeah, i thought of that. but since it's really not *that* expensive to put
an alarm in, and i'd have to go to all the trouble to run the wiring to put
in a couple of blinking lights anyway, i may as well go for the real thing.
I suspect that in the neighborhood i live in, people can probably tell the
difference between a fake and a real alarm. there have been quite a few
radios stolen, and i once had all 4 tires on my jetta slashed because i
came home at 4:00 am one winter morning, and had no choice but to move a
chair that was marking a spot someone had shoveled. doesn't make much
sense, slashing my tires to get me to move, but i haven't repeated that
ever since...

i figure the couple hundred dollars to install an alarm is worth it
compared to tha hassle of dealing with broken dashboard parts and stolen
radios.
