Subject: Starting Problem '78 FI Engine

I get decent cranking with new solenoid relay, but, engine cold, I have
to crank for a while, stop and crank again before engine fires. Last
resort, I squirt starting fluid into air cleaner for a decent start.
Engine hot, I get no start with any amount of cranking, and have to
resort to starting fluid, which barely gets her to fire up after a
persistant crank.

Once running my re-built GEX engine with 56K miles on it runs strong and
cool.  I've checked thermo-time and put in brand new cold start valve.
Points, distributor, plugs are new, timing and dwell checked and
adjusted.  Have not checked fuel pressure, but put in new fuel pump
which I'd been keeping as a spare.  Head temp sensor was new about five
years ago. Will check air temp sensor.  Would appreciate any ideas on
this puzzle. It's driving me crazy!
