John,

My wife and I put &quot;new&quot; fiberglass on Lizzard (front hinged), it's not heavy
just awkward, we had trouble lining up the brackets with the holes in the
top of the bus.  It seems that you need to prop the top up to get to the
bolt holes, but not so far as to let it slide off the bus.  

We put it on the bus in about 45 minutes, not including canvas.

How easy it to (re-) install a pop-top? I searched the archives to no
avail-

My Vangon Westy pop-top needs re-furbishing and I was thinking of
removing it from the van (since I'm going to replace the canvas anyway)
for several reasons - can clean the inside top without mucking up my
van's interior, easier to sand on saw horses outside and the big reason,
can move it down my cellar so I can prep and paint at night with the
comfort of the wood stove getting a jump on spring. But if the top is a
big job to align when re-installing, then I rather skip it and get the
step ladder (s) out
 
Any help with this one?
