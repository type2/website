What you describe is the way all the early baywindow Westfalia iceboxes are.
The only anomaly is the tray you've asked about.

I'm not saying it absolutely is not an original Westfalia part.  I'm saying
that in nearly 30 years of '68-'72 Westfalia Campmobile experience I've
never seen such a tray, even in a brand-new rig.

As a matter of fact, I've spent a lot of time over the years looking for
some shelves, etc., I could adapt to use in my Westy icebox.  Since that
interior is a pretty universal icebox setup there ought to be something
available in RV parts stores, but I've yet to find anything that would fit
properly and be strong enough to carry a load supported only by the side
rims in the icebox slots.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  In my bus (and in the picture on the link I attached) there is a slot
at the bottom of the fridge for something to slide in to. On the super
original 72 in my link (which is on VWplanet classifieds right now
www.thesamba_dot_com ) there IS a big tray there as if a vegetable crisper or
something. http://www.72camper_dot_com/3936.jpg
If this tray is not original what are the slots for? A rack? It sure looks
original.  &lt;&lt;
