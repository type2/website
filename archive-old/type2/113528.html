&gt;Question:  When the engine was reinstalled a new throw out bearing was

&gt;the engine removed and the thing greased up?

Bad noise from the clutch is not stock. You may have a worn cross shaft 
fork. It will not hold the TO bearing true, or maybe the TO bearing was not 
clipped on properly. If you hired them to fix the clutch, they should pull 
it and fix it. If you hired them to R&amp;R the TO bearing, then that's what 
they did. If they failed to verify the fork fingers, they should pull it as 
well, and charge only for the cross-shaft repair, but only if you took it 
too a shop known to be knowledgable with VW clutches. If you took it to a 
generalist shop, not checking for fork wear should be expected.

But the bottom line is, if it is making noise, something is not right and 
it needs to be removed and properly inspected by a VW experienced mechanic 
to know the cause of the fault.
