Subject: looking  for beltline body chrome 

Hi all! 
I'm soon to send my bus in for painting, back to original colors. I would like to spruce it up with the addition of the deluxe type chrome that wraps around the bubble line. I've checked the web vendors with no luck, does anyone know of a supplier? 

Need to do this soon as the holes need to be drilled before painting. Thanks in advance and I'll try to get some before and after pics on to the list.
