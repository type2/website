Subject: what color were the original cast iron dizzies??

Just wondering if anyone has one of the early early dizzies and could tell
me the color? I seem to recall it being not black but a brownish black???  I
m going to paint a restored 010 for my engine and want a close match.

Thanks,

Courtney
