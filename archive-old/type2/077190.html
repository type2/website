Subject: Re: [T2] Engine-neering - combustion chamber question

Cool idea. Keep us updated...

I was told once that the elbows were &quot;afterburner&quot; pipes for the late 
baywindows and that they go very, very hot b/c combustion was continuing 
inside the pipes.

What'cha think?

&gt;&gt;I was going to do the same (wrap my pipes) until an old racer warned me 
&gt;&gt;of the potential damage it could/would do to the steel. It was just that 
&gt;&gt;I got excited b/c I knew something that I wanted to share with you. It 
&gt;&gt;does make power but it leads to periodical pipe replacement. I guess it 
&gt;&gt;just depends on what you use your vehicle for. I'm always lacking cash 
&gt;&gt;for replacement pipes or spares...
&gt;
&gt;I'm not sure I buy the &quot;damage to pipes&quot; argument on a bus.  On a race 
&gt;car, sure.  At full throttle, lightweight headers can glow red 
&gt;hot.  Contain that heat with header wrap, and yeah I could see it damaging 
&gt;the pipes.  I'm not sure that the thick bus exhaust pipes would ever get 
&gt;that hot.  I'm definately going to wrap my heater pipes  and junction 
&gt;boxes with the stuff, and I will probably wrap my heater boxes too.  As 
&gt;for the pipes, I don't think there would be a significant benefit so I 
&gt;probably won't do it, but it's not because I'm afraid of damaging 
&gt;them.  I'm more concerned with water getting under the wrap and rusting 
&gt;the heater boxes.  Hopefully it will evaporate fast enough that it won't 
&gt;be a problem.
&gt;
&gt;Next time I get a decent set of heater boxes (the 3-year-old Dansk boxes I 
&gt;have now don't qualify) I am going to ceramic-coat the outsides and put an 
&gt;end to rust and heat loss once and for all.  It's expensive, but you only 
&gt;have to pay for it once.
