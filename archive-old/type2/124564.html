Subject: Re: [T2] Breather Line Replacement, Fuel Tank

Michael asked:

&gt; I was also looking at htis piece that I though was an elbow turns out to be
 a Tee. I know that the vent lines form either side of the rear engine
 compartment tie in here. Where does the other port go to? Is this supposed
 to go to the air cleaner?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`

The small end goes to the small nipple on the charcoal cannister. The cannister gets the fumes from the gas
tank thru that line.

The left large hose on the cannister goes to the left end of the fan housing. Fresh air gets into the
cannister thru it.

The right large hose on the cannister goes to the EEC valve on the front side of the air cleaner. The small
nipple on the EEC valve is tee'd to the ported vacuum line between the nipple on the front of the throttle
housing and the vacuum advance. As you accelerate, the EEC valve opens and venturi vacuum draws the fuel fumes
from the charcoal cannister into the engine to be burned.

Anyone that removes the FI defeats this whole system.......
