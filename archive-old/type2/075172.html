Subject: Re: [T2] Anyone got a rpm limiting rotor?

I am certain that Berg carries these, or used to last year...



&gt; isn't there a VDO tach that has a rev limiter built into it that wires
&gt; into the ignition?
&gt; 
&gt; I could swear someone said something about this about a year or so ago,
&gt; and couldn't figure out why his engine was cutting out at 3000 rpm until
&gt; he found the switch on the back :)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Looking for a 5400 or 5800 rev limiting rotor. Does anyone have one they'd

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; These are truely hard to find. As far as I know they are NLA. The trouble
&gt;&gt; is that it is a part that wears out, so there are even fewer of these than
&gt;&gt; anything else.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I found one on *-bay some time ago for about $30 bucks. I haven't seen one
&gt;&gt; lately though. I put it on when my wife drives the bus, as she is not very
&gt;&gt; good with  a stick yet, but is learning. I am unfortunately for you, not
&gt;&gt; interested in parting with it.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Good luck finding one. If you find a reliable source, I am sure that many
&gt;&gt; of us would love to know about it. THough you may want to order yourself a
&gt;&gt; bunch before telling us. ;)
