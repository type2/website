Subject: RE: Getting off Lug Nuts (was: Helping a Fellow Vw'er)

This thread seems to have touched a common feeling among us.  That is we all
seem to have BTDT or at least attempted to.  After reading all these, I have
decided to go down to Sears and buy a good 6 point socket to add to my toolbox
next to the assorted breaker bars to use the next time, as I do always feel like
somewhat of a contortionist when using the crossbar, pulling up on one end,
balancing on one foot and trying to get the other foot to land squarely with
sufficient force on the other end without cocking the crossbar, resulting in a
rounded lug bolt.  I also really like the hammer idea and look forward to trying
that one out. 

Looks like its time to rotate the tires.

Have a great weekend,
terry
