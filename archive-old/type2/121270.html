&gt;   I have been putting off timing the engine because if I accidentally
&gt; step
&gt; on the brake pedal Ill have to bleed the brakes again.  Been reading
&gt; in
&gt; the Bentley manual, Idiot manual, and the instructions that came with
&gt; my
&gt; new shiny chrome timing light.  It sounds easy enough, Ive seen it
&gt; done
&gt; once or twice.  But not doing it and thinking about it is causing me to
&gt; have doubts.

Have confidence in your ability to time the engine.  It is, quite
possibly, one of the easiest tasks that can be done on a VW, especially
one with a Type 1 engine (us poor saps with the Type 4 engines have to
deal with timing scales on which the numbering has worn off :-)

If you're getting impatient to do *something* with it, you'd be well
served to go out and turn the engine with a wrench, looking for the
timing notch on the pulley, and marking it with some Liquid Paper (just
a teeny little dot of it), and on your timing reference mark (the
crankcase seam on a Type 1 engine, IIRC).  The Liquid Paper really
helps the timing mark to show up under the strobe light.

&gt;   Found an article on the use of regular vs. premium gas at the Boston
&gt; Engine site.  He states that us air cooled folks should be using
&gt; premium
&gt; because it is not the same gas that was available back in the day.  I
&gt; am
&gt; tempted to do this and see what becomes of it.

Hm.  I read an article like this once, but seem to remember that it
said the opposite.  The way I understand it is that there is a
disconnect between the old and new methods of measuring/calculating
octane.  The new method ends up with a lower number, and thus &quot;91&quot; with
the old method is roughly equivalent to &quot;87&quot; with the new method.  Or
something like that.

In any case, I distinctly recall the gist of the article being &quot;you
don't need to put premium gas in your air-cooled VW&quot;.

Really, the only benefit you're going to get from that expensive gas is
improved resistance to detonation (pinging).  If your timing is set
properly, then you should not have a problem with detonation.  If you
have modified your engine to have a higher compression ratio, then you
indeed might need to use a higher-octane gas... but I'm almost certain
that you don't need to on a stock engine.

(Certainly, when I was a student driving around a '72 Super Beetle, I
put the cheapest gas I could find in it, and never had a problem :-)
