Hi Andy,

Right now the beaches in SC seen to be calling, but
Florida is not out of the question.  By the way, the
list I was referring to was the AIRS list.  I was
hoping to get the East Coast in spreadsheet form so
within a state you could sort by city, and line AIRS
members up with your trip.  I figure name, phone,
email, and location would make a concise AIRS list.

I tried cutting and pasting from AIRS to a
spreadsheet, then editing the spreadsheet, but it took
me over an hour to do North Carolina.  At that point I
wondered if anyone had an easier way to do this.

Rob
