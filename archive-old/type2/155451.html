Subject: Re: [T2] Foldable Spare

&gt; Presumably in the deflated state the rubber tire folded in on itself to
&gt; save
&gt; space otherwise what would of been the point?


I saw one in person last year. Since the rubber isn't made anymore, and 30
year old tire rubber is worse than useless, it's just for novelty now.

But it was VW's first attempt at a &quot;space saver&quot; spare. Before the little
donuts with &quot;SPARE&quot; for the tread came out.
