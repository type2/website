Does your VW workshop manual mention anything about the Altitude
compensator circuit?  Finally got my bus thru emmissions today after
tearing through the complete FI system..   My bus origninally came with a
toggle switch for high and low altitude where as the Bosch manual (in the
list library) shows a barametric device.   This is the only resource I've
found that even mentions the altitude circuit.  My original switch rattled
away years ago and I replaced it with a hardware store variety.  Last time
I connected it I must have put the label (high/low) on backwards as this
was the source of my rich mixture.  It was on low (richer mixture) when it
showed high (lean mixture, over 4000 feet).  This switch was located by the
control unit and two wires lead back to the wiring harness.  In checking
the  continuity of these  two leads I find they lead to the # 12   and 7,
8, 9 positions on the master plug with varying ohm readings.

I'd sure like to find some more information about this and how it works?
Any ideas?


Does anyone else out there have a &quot;high/low&quot; switch located next to the
control unit?

Thanks
