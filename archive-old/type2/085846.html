&gt;I went into my Yahoo profile and everything in here is true,
&gt;all my marketing preferences were set for Spamming.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,

&gt;From another list I subscribe to... Rumour has it that it
&gt;affects
&gt;Yahoogroups members.  You might want to check your 'marketing
&gt;preferences'.

&gt;March 29 - Tired of spam you're getting at your free Yahoo! e-
&gt;mail
&gt;account? Get ready for more. Tucked inside a privacy policy
&gt;change
&gt;the company made this week was notice that more Yahoo! e-mail
&gt;marketing offers were coming &quot;even if users had formerly
&gt;indicated
&gt;they were unwanted. YAHOO! GRANTED ITSELF PERMISSION to spam
&gt;by
&gt;creating a new &quot;marketing preferences&quot; page that lets users
&gt;pick &quot;yes or no&quot; to specific categories of marketing pitches.
&gt;The
&gt;problem is, Yahoo! set every users' option to &quot;yes&quot; - even if
&gt;long
&gt;ago, they indicated they never wanted any Yahoo! spam.
&gt;
&gt;Users who don't want marketing offers from Yahoo have 60
&gt;days to do the following: Visit the user profile preferences
&gt;page at
&gt;http://edit.my.yahoo_dot_com/config/eval_profile select &quot;Edit your
&gt;marketing preferences&quot; from within the Member Information
&gt;section;
&gt;and individually change selections in a series of marketing
&gt;categories from &quot;yes&quot; to &quot;no.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;In e-mail marketing lingo, the process is known as &quot;opt-out.&quot;
&gt;But even performing that slightly cumbersome operation is no
&gt;guarantee that Yahoo! marketing offers won't come, since the
&gt;firm
&gt;reserves the right to add marketing categories at any time.
&gt;
&gt;&quot;I'd suggest re-checking periodically,&quot; writes another
&gt;mailing list poster.
