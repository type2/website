I installed one of those on my last bus (78 camper) and it works great,
though noisy. If you have a later bus with the insulated paper duct upfront
then that is the place to put it, that's where I put mine. Haven't messed
around with an older bus with the metal ducts. Maybe the noise level is why
they want you to mount it farther back.
