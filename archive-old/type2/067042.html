It's very clear and convenient to know these signals when motoring
south of the border.

Anyone seen these signals in use in our country?&lt;

I used to see people flashing their lights at oncoming traffic if a speed
trap was ahead (this maneuver is used quite often in New Jersey, from which
I originate).

P. S. Research shows that most people who have left New Jersey wish to move
back someday.
