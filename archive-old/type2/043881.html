&gt; &gt;Also, any advice or &quot;must dos&quot; for putting a motor back in would be most
&gt; &gt;appreciated.  Anyone have any &quot;workarounds&quot; for not being able to find a
&gt; &gt;clutch alignment tool.  My buddy says he's known a few people who were
able
&gt; &gt;to line things up w/a screwdriver, but I'm not sure I could intuit my way
&gt; &gt;thru' it.
&gt;
&gt; This is really nothing to be afraid of at all, for about the last ten
&gt; engine pulls I've just put the clutch pack on finger-tight and lined the
&gt; clutch disc up with my fingers. I can never find the stupid plastic clutch
&gt; alignment tool so I gave up looking for it and it's no loss, you can
&gt; eyeball it easily.
&gt;
&gt; This was on a Type I but I can't believe a Type IV is any different. Could
&gt; be wrong. =^ )

I use a 3/8&quot; Snap-On ratchet.....the end fits the pilot bearing and the fat
part of the handle fits in the center of the hub on a type4.
