&gt; Here is the situation: Took the Bus (78) to get emissions today and the guy said he couldn't get it to high enough RPM's, it kept &quot;spurting&quot;. He says he thinks the fuel system is dirty and I should change the filter and add a fuel additive to clean it. So I begin to drive it home and it doesn't make it. It starts fine, and idles fine, but when i accelerate it lurches back and forth and sputters as if the fuel supply is being interrupted. Had to park it and walk home. What do you think the problem is? Note that this bus sat in a field for 5 years and I haven't done anything to the fuel system yet. I've driven about 70 miles since I got it and it ran fine until now.

change fuel filter
CHANGE ALL OF YOUR FUEL LINES
drain the gas in there and use it in your lawnmower
try the suggested fuel additive


good luck
Bob
