Subject: Re: [T2] engine block grilled cheese

Place food to be cooked in foil wrap. Use mechanics wire to affix foil 
wrapped food substances to top of  heater box. One hour driving time at hiway 
speeds is about equal to 40 min. in an oven set at 300deg.f. Really. Okay, 
that's assuming that it ain't snowing, raining or below 40 outside.
