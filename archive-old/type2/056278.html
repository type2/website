And be sure to mark where 7.5 ATDC is, or whatever timing mark you're
supposed to set the timing to, on the timing scale.  Better yet, go to a
junkyard and get a plastic one, if you have one of the older, painted
metal ones.  Mine was covered with gunk and when I wiped it off, the paint
came with it.

I know it's best to time the engine at max advance, but if you're messing
with the distributor it's much easier to static time it to at least get
the motor running.
