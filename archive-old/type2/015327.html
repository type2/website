&gt;2.) Just what is a &quot;vapor lock&quot; anyways? I've never heard this term 
&gt;defined in any context.

If the liquid fuel in the lines gets too warm/hot it will turn to vapor
bubbles which the system down the line was not meant to pass. Every cycle
of the injector then pumps a fraction of vaporized fuel instead of liquid
fuel and you go way lean and therefore no combustion and no go no more till
it cools and condenses back to liquid. In the case of carburaters the
liquid level drops in the fuel bowl and is replaced by nothing as the
vapor vents from the bowl as all carburators are vented.
