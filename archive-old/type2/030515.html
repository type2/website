Hello,

Basically he is asking you to pay for their stupidity.... you dont have to
pull the hub to get to the brakes.

All 71 and newer busses have composite drums, that means the drum is held
onto the hub with 2 11mm bolts.  remove those and the drum separates from
the hub easy as pie (in theory.)

Often the drum is rusted to the hub, but this can be fixed with a hand
sledge heat and penetrating oil in short order 9 times out of 10.

Take your business elsewhere i'd say... (i'd sell you one but i no have
it.)

take care,

Steve

p.s. the composite drum thing is something i'd say 9 out of 10 vw
enthusiasts dont know about... because its different than bugs and 70 &amp;
older busses, 71-79 busses are the only pre 79 ACVW's that have  it. Maybe
type4's do, but i've never played with one of those.
