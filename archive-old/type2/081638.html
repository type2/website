Subject: [T2] rust question??


&gt; Hey,
&gt;  i posted this message before, im not sure if anyone saw it or not but, i
&gt; live in new york and i just got my first bus that was just shipped from
&gt; arizona. its rust free and in great shape. since i live in N.Y. theres a
&gt; better chance for rust to form. i dont have a garage, so what do you think
i
&gt; can do to prevent rust formation (especially the under carriage)??? i was
&gt; thinking about a bus covor but thats not gonna help the under carriage
from
&gt; driving in pretty bad weather conditions with the salty roads and such. if
&gt; anybody lives in the new york area or anyone that knows something can can
&gt; prevent this it would be a HUGE help!/ thanks alot
&gt; -Matt
