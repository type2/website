Subject: [T2] Anyone fix the stalling when stopping problem?

A couple weeks ago there was much discuisson regarding stalling while
decelarating and stopping for lights etc. I never saw any solutions posted,
did anyone fix this and if so what was the prob? Mine still stalls while
stopping at every light but then idles when I restart it.
