&gt; Is a B-4 Ebersbacher heater correct for a 74 Westy?
&gt; 
&gt; I guess the question is--is the B-4 the correct unit for a 74?

there are BN-4 and BA-4 both used in 74 on different VW's

the flat one with a duct at each of the 4 corners pointing down is from a
VW 411/412 car and have to be engineered to fit a bus (I have one in my
bus)this is the BA-4


  The square box type is the ones used in the buses this is the BN-4

the BN-4 is pretty much a plug in fit (with a little cut and paste)
the BA-4 takes a pretty fair amount of work to get installed and working,
also the BA-4 has parts of it scattered all over the sedan/wagen and it
takes some pretty good scavanging to get all the parts
