Howdy!
    I have the complete front beam for a 71 bus sitting in my garage,
and I don't want it. It has good rotors, good steering box, good master
cylinder and booster. Basically, it is good. I don't need it, I don't
want it, and I don't want to take it to the dump (it seems such a
waste...)
    If you want it, you can have it...
I live in Santa Rosa, Ca, about an hour north of San Francisco up 101.
