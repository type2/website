Subject: raising (ground clearance) a 71 type II

I have seen many Baja bus's, and many tht have been around for years with no ill effects. Done 
sensibly they last and handle well. Yes things like CV's will live a shorter life, but as long as the 
angle increase is not dramatic they still last.
As was asked earlier, what is the goal? If you only want a small increase it's not that hard.
On My bus ('77) I had the suspension set only a little above stock ~1/4-1/2&quot; higher which has no 
real effect on the bus, but the big one was the wheels, I went to 215R15 dual purpose tyres which 
gave me a little over 1&quot; extra height + a bit more grip off road, and a bit more floatation for on 
the sand. About the only things that have gotten me bogged is very uneven ground and loosing 
grip on one tyre (a limited slip diff would be nice). With rims on a stock offset these tyres fit under 
the bus with no mods, but the front will just touch the top of the guards if I bottom it out (very 
rare).
The BIG baja bus's with larger tyres and such need to do a lot of chopping on the guards and 
major suspension surgery.
