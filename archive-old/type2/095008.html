Subject: Warm Air Bellows

RE: warm air bellows from a Vanagon to a late bay VW.

Someone said the Vanagon LEFT (drive side - US model) bellows would replace 
either bellows on the late bay.

How about the Vanagon RIGHT bellows ??  It is longer, because it seems to be 
in two parts.

Can the longer Vanagon RIGHT bellows setup be used to replace the 
bellows-heater_control_box combination on the late bays??

This would be intended to give straight through, non-adjustable warm air 
flow.

I just wired my heater control boxes to allow full flow.  It got a bit warm 
in the cab this morning, but I just opened a window .

Yes, come the spring, I will un-wire these boxes, but isn't this a ritual 
that is followed by many 'northerners'??
