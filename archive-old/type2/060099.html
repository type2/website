Sounds like one or two of the strands have broken at the firewall and
got the cable snarled up.  You'll need a new cable.  Also make sure your
return springs are working properly so that the cable is kept tight (one
at the pedal hinge and one in the engine compartment).  And grease
everything up while you're at it.
