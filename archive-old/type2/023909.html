Subject: Type 2 to earlier transmission

Hello List,
	I looked in the archives for information on fitting a 1.8ltr
carberated engine on a earlier transmission to replace a dual port type 1
engine in either my 71 bus or my 181.  Just looking at the Flywheel: will
the 1.8ltr flywheel fit on a type 1 transmission? I have worries about the
lack of a type 1 gland nut bearing race to support the different sized
transmission shaft.  

	The Engine bay tin differences looks like a lot of sheet metal work.
Shouldn't bee too bad with the ole trusty MIG however.  
	Other than the flywheel fit concerns, are there any folks out there
that have done this before?
	
	I would love to ask some questions about such a conversion with
experienced folks.

Many Thanks

Paul Silas 
71 Bus
