Subject: Re: Help with replacing Westy top in 68...

&gt;On my '71, there's a plastic strip over the cloth; the staples go through
&gt;that strip (about 3/32&quot; thick) and then through the cloth and into the
&gt;wood, making it pretty easy to pull the staples. Guess they didn't think
&gt;of that in '68?

It's like that, and the staples in the plastic strip aren't that hard to
remove. Pry on the strip with a tool we call the BFS.* Comes right off.

But underneath the plastic strip, the canvas is stapled to the wood about
every 3/4 inch all around. I guess I just should keep at it with the tiny
screwdriver and the pliers?

*A screwdriver of exceptional size
