Subject: Re: 65' bus door key question

If you take the door handle apart (take the cargo door handle) you will
notice that there is a four digit number with a &quot;T&quot; preceeding it (i.e.
T1234) I know this number corresponds to the way to cut they key. M

yes- 64 through 67 buses came w/ a T series key which worked all locks,
including ignition unless you have a steering lock ignition, which till 66
would have its own unique key.

My question is does VW still have those codes about i.e. can you give them
that number and they would know how to properly cut the key?
- - - 
I don't know if VW does, but many good locksmiths shops do.  the one here in
Oly does, and has cut keys for me to code.   I did that for Nellie, which
works all but the back hatch, which refuses to come off to have its lock
examined.

I am 99% sure that the key for the igntion and the key for the doors were
different on a 65' bus am I correct?

originally it was the same, unless (entirely possible) the ignition has been
replaced at some point.
