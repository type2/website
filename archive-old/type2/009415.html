Lauria:

If all of your brake hoses are new and the system has been bled properly,
you might check the condition of your pads and shoes.  If even a small
amount of brake fluid or grease leaked onto the surface, uneven braking
will result.  You might also check the adjustment of your rear brakes. 

Thank you!

 The dang brakes pull to the left. I would say the left front brake pulls
 to the right.   Hardly there when braking regularly, definitely there
 when braking hard, though not drastically so(it's not jerking the wheel
 out of your hands or anything).  Just had the brake lines replaced and
 brakes were bled and adjusted.  All other brake gear said to be in good
 shape, ready to go.
 
 This problem also is a minor pain in the bundolas.  One of the mechanics
 at the garage doing our work for us sez that his '71 pulls to the left
 also, he has not been able to figure it out.
 
 Anything else we should be looking at?
