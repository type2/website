Subject: Re: [T2] VWoA and the bus trademark


Just checked here:

http://tess_dot_uspto_dot_gov

for the 199 things that vw *does* own....didn't see &quot;bus&quot; but did see
&quot;microbus&quot;.....some of the others were pretty weird though....


BEETLE BIKE
PROMOTION
SUSTAINABLE INNOVATIONS
TURBONIUM
BENTLEY FINANCIAL SERVICES   ??????
COOL SHADES                  ??????

and the weirdest one!  CREATE AN APOSTLE


BTW, for those who might feel better knowing this....I have had two 
different people ask me about what i thought of them buying a new VW.

Told them the story about the guy who was getting sued for making a vw 
hubcap clock(and selling it)...told them the story about the local dealer 
who told someone in the local club that they wouldn't sell him a new 
beetle turbo for list(he went out of state).  Told them the story about 
vw walking in to RMMW and what happened there......

Needless to say, both peoples' mouths fell open and they decided that they 
were *not* interested in a VW.  

I think &quot;busxxxx&quot; business owners are probably pretty safe right now.


Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt;First off, I can guarantee that VWOA's trademark creeps are going to start
&gt; actively pursuing anyone who uses &quot;bus&quot; in their domain name, especially if
&gt; it is a VW oriented site. Watch out BusDepot, BustedBus, etc...  They did
&gt; the same thing when the &quot;new&quot; Beetle came out, and I fully expect them to
&gt; try to repossess the rights to anything and everything bus-related.&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; This slightly interests me.  A &quot;bus&quot;  does not just pertain to VW.  
In fact, that word was out many years before the VW was even around.  
And furthermore, being a fan of all vintage busses, and not just VWs, 
I have seen many pictures of late 40s busses that the original microbus looks just like.  
In that respect, it looks like VW could have been copying these passenger busses 
in a smaller scale.  Therefore becoming the &quot;micro&quot; bus.  A big bus in 
small scale.  I would love to see a company like Flexible Flyer, 
come out and sue VWoA for some kind of infringement on the original bus shape.  
Would that not be something?  VW does not, and never will own the &quot;bus&quot; name.  
Beetle?  that is a whole different animal.  Never was a beetle before the beetle.
