Okay got's to put my 2 cents into this one!!  Some one wrote:  'In aircraft,
they have what are called &quot;annunciator lights&quot; that come on when various
aircraft parameters (exotic things like &quot;oil pressure&quot; and such) are out of
the safe range.  These let the pilot know that things are amiss before
things go completely haywire.  &quot;

Reply: In the more modern aircraft they do have annunciator lights, but they
really don't tell the pilot or his crew much.  The important thing here is
to know what is going on, not just that something is quote&quot; going haywire,
unquote.  In 7,000 hours of flying, thank god we had gauges and are you
ready for this, blinking lights!!  The same thing with eighteen wheelers.
Have you ever stepped into a cab of one of these machines. Gauges, gauges
and gauges, and little red lights that &quot;blink.&quot;

As to the &quot;American Way&quot; with no gauges, we &quot;Americans&quot; as usual got lazy
and Detroit knows that and it costs Detroit money to install the real
thing!! Then I ask you, why in recent years has dear old Detroit put back
the &quot;gauges.&quot;  Because the general public who really care about their
equipment really want to know what the oil pressure is, what the water temp
is, and if the battery is charging.

My current 79 Loaf does not have gauges, but experience is telling me I
will. I agree with you George that gauges are a good item for diagnosis, but
why not have the diagnosis tools with you while the machine is in its actual
environment when it is happening!!  Correct me if I am wrong, but when you
have a problem with your Loaf's engine, doesn't the mechanic trying to fit
your problem, trying to duplicate your problem in his shop with gauges??
For me, in the near future, I am not waiting for some light bulb to tell me
that my oil pressure is low, or the oil temp is to high. Don't you think
thats a little bit to late!!!
