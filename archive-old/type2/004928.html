... Someone mentioned that they had seen the Graco seats in second hand
stores.  Under no circumstances should you ever purchase a child safety seat
used, from anyone, PERIOD!  Even if the seat was involved in one minor wreck
with no visible damage, it could still have structurally problems.  Your
child is worth the price difference for a brand new seat!  Excuse this
message having no Bus content, but this is too important to let slip.
Thanks!
