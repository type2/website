&gt;Fast forward to last Wednesday evening, two days before I was supposed to 
&gt;go for a weekend of roadracing at Hallett MRC 
&gt;(http://www.hallettracing_dot_com/).  The car started overheating slowly and I 
&gt;found that the in-tank oil cooler had sprung a leak, allowing oil to mix 
&gt;with coolant and vice-versa.  It was a horrible mess, and I was forced to 
&gt;remove the sandwich adapter and oil cooler connections.

This is why I say no always to aftermarket oil coolers for VW's. Everyone 
ever in my shop what there for a new motor due to lubrication failure.

&gt;I went racing anyway.  I figure that to be near 320 degrees and I am sure 
&gt;I exceeded even that

All REAL racers of modified stock motors dump the oil after every race for 
this reason. It cooks the oil. If they don't, they soon cook enough motors 
they got no more money for racing. That's why real racers by oil in drums, 
they use a lot of it to keep the motors hot and humming.

&gt;In the end, the engine seems to have suffered no ill effects.

When the oil gets overheated it looses it's viscosity. You can feel this 
with your fingers. If it thins out, change it, as often as your special use 
requires. If you keep the oil fresh you won't hurt your bearings.

&gt;  Oil pressure and vacuum are still normal, no bad noises, car still goes 
&gt; like stink.  From this I can only conclude that peoples fears about high 
&gt; oil temps (mine included) have been way overblown.

Don't fear high oil temps. Just change the oil before it thins out. All 
special uses must have special maintenance. And it really is folly to 
compare a water cooled V-8 Ford with an air cooled VW. There is very little 
difference in HP/cc between a stock 2.0L VW and a stock 5.0L Ford. The big 
difference is that you can't modify the cooling system of the VW like you 
can the Ford to cool the hot modifications.
