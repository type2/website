Subject: Buying Questions

I currently have a '78 Deluxe in need of a motor replacement. 

My question is that I have found a '75 Westi with a complete motor and
interior, but the engine is locked up. It looks good on the outside and
there is no oil on the ground. The body is in perfect health. Is it
possible to rebuild a lock T4 and be able to bet miles out of it. The PO
wants &lt;$500&gt; for the whole thing, including locked motor

Help Please.
