Subject: Re: [T2] New to This, Need some Advice-LONG RAMBLES

Hey Stephanie --- about 10 years ago I was right where you are now.

It took only a couple years to be able to make most of my repairs - big and 
small. The time since has been refining my abilities (practice) and 
learning new skills (like woodworking which could be applied to my bus).

At the time I had nothing like the Internet access we have now so I was all 
alone, and teaching myself the secrets of the VW with books, and the 
popular magazines (of dubious value, be careful with those things). I'll 
get there eventually! &lt;grin&gt;

I'll suggest the standards in manuals -- Bentley, Muir and Haynes. I 
dislike the Haynes but on a few occasions it offered a different take on a 
repair or a different picture.

There are many more books advertised by our VW suppliers and some are very 
interesting and some are very valuable. I have the carburetor books (Webber 
and Dellorto) from CB and have found them to be very good (but not 
applicable to your situation if you still have the OEM Solex carbs) and 
have the 911 Performance Handbook (not applicable to either your or my 
situation but it does a good job of explaining how Porsche got the 
performance they did from a very similar engine to ours --- refinement, 
$$$, refinement!!!). It explained sizing custom carbs and exhaust to me 
well anyhow.

You'll find hundreds of references of why one book is better or worse than 
the other in the archives but I find that each has it's benefits and with 
the three you can compare information.

I like Muir because he breaks it down to the very basics --- this is a 
starter, this is where it is located, this is what it does, and this is how 
it does it. It ain't perfect but it's pretty good.

Bentley has the factory pics and procedures but often uses tools I don't 
ever expect to see first hand (exotic stuff).

I already mentioned Haynes.

I'm as much an armchair mechanic as a real live shade tree mechanic. I'll 
do any repair except rebuilding transmissions - but this I will try someday 
too.

And of course you have Type2_dot_com (and it's cousins) which is more valuable 
than all three books put together!

Take it slow. Take repairs one at a time. Disassemble things one at a time. 
Ask alot of questions.

Buy a decent (doesn't have to be the best) selection of tools AS YOU NEED 
them. I have personally and have seen folks buy hundreds of $$$ of tools 
that they didn't really need. Expensive stuff lasts forever but sometimes 
you can find cheaper import stuff that will last a novice for a long, long 
time. I have alot of 15 year old Chinese stuff mixed with my better tools 
(some German, some American, some Italian). Some of the cheap stuff has 
been used 2-3 times because it came as a set. Some more commonly used stuff 
I wore out, broke, and replaced with better a longtime ago.

This is another topic which you will find many references to in the archives!

Buy the basics and then expand your tool collection as necessary. I buy 
tools only when I know I'll need it again, when I can't borrow it, when the 
money saved offsets the price of paying for the repair to be done for me, 
and when I think (THINK is the key word) I can do a better job in the long 
run.

Buy the tool for this repair and you can do it next time for free or do the 
same repair for someone else for $$$.

Tackle topics one at a time so you don't get overwhelmed by the scope of 
the project.

First (for example) steering, then brakes, then tires. Complete each task 
before moving to the next. Helps prevent a bunch of extra parts laying 
around that you have no hope of reinstalling correctly.

When adjusting anything (engine mostly) make one adjustment at a time and 
judge it's effect. Is the result better or worse? It can teach you how a 
component affects the engine. Also makes it easier to return to the 
starting point if the result of the adjustment is worse. It is more 
difficult to adjust the carbs and the timing and the valves - oh, and 
replace the distributor and then adjust the carb again and then try to 
figure out which item is making the engine run worse than 2 hours ago.

This method will improve your diagnostic abilities.

When asking questions - use a consensus method. Three people advised you 
that three different reasons were making your bus run poorly. Find out who 
is right by asking more people. Or study your books. Eventually you will 
find your answer (cars and busses are not that complicated...) and you will 
be smarter for it. Anyone of the three original people could be right - but 
which one?

Try to distill egos from advice you receive. I have actually seen people 
try their hardest to simply convince me they were right. Seeming right was 
more important than BEING right.

Some folks have a hard time admitting they don't know the right answer. 
There is alot of BAD advice floating around out there. Thankfully most of 
it is not on the list. Some will lead to positive immediate results with 
bad long term effects.

One example is the question of overheating. It may be overheating for 
several reasons - fuel mixture, stuck flappers, timing, brakes dragging, 
dirty engine, missing tin, etc. etc.

Many, many, many times the advice from a non-VW mechanic would be to simply 
remove the flappers. They are the problem the mechanic says. Maybe it runs 
cooler, maybe it doesn't.

Maybe - just maybe he finds the real problem in the process - something 
that would cost $5 to repair  but he chooses to continue to remove the 
flappers because this nets him maybe $50 instead. Of course he never 
mentions the $5 solution. It happens and is the biggest reason I work on my 
own cars always.

Most on the list will tell you that there are a few times that removing the 
flappers is okay (like if you live in the desert) but the factory put them 
in there for a reason - to help the motor warm up, make heat, get the oil 
hot, minimize emissions, run better in cold weather, etc. This is another 
area of frequent discussion.

I would spend alot of time to verify that all of the factory pieces are on 
your engine - seals and tin and in good condition, oh - and clean! Clean 
makes it easier to work on and to see problems. Clean also makes it cool 
better I'm told. I think so anyhow. I also like to show of my ordinary, 
non-perfect but clean engine to friends. Maybe the first and last clean VW 
engine they ever see! &lt;grin&gt;

Try to organize repairs so you don't have to remove previously repaired 
assemblies. (Brakes, steering, tires. You would be removing the brakes 
again to make steering repairs possibly).

Don't forget that you need to ensure that your van is safe to be on the 
road. What is point to make it clean and shiny if the brakes are waiting to 
fail? I want it to be safe for you and for me (whom you share the road with...)

I would start with: buying a good fire extinguisher, replacing all fuel 
lines, replacing rubber brake lines, inspecting brakes, and oh - the 
steering (you mentioned some repairs there but I did not pay attention...).

Each small chore will help you learn the different parts and pieces of your 
van and prepare for the large projects it will require.

It will also help you learn the difference between a repair and a good 
repair ( a good repair stays repaired).

Well I've rambled enough! Hope this helped encourage you.

You can do this just like the rest of us. It isn't really a born talent 
like a musical instrument, but is more related to study and practice.

Now if you want to get into building hot rod or blueprinted engines - now I 
think that might be a genetic trait some people carry!!! &lt;grin&gt; Not gender 
related at all! Hope I got that gene!

Keep us updated and ask plenty of questions. Nothing is too basic or dumb.
