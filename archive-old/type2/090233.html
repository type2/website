Subject: Re: [T2] VWoA and the bus trademark

These complaints about VWoA seem valid in isolation, but let me provide a 
bit of perspective: my beloved cars in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s were 
Fiats and MGs. Anyone try to get service from their Fiat dealer lately? 
Anyone try to get an MG Metro Turbo, deal or no deal?

No matter what terrible things VWoA may do, there is nothing worse than 
having a marque pull out of the market altogether.
