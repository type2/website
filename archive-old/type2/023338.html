1) What sandpaper type (number) should I use to get the rust down?
2) Can I get the rust down to where I need to with a hand (non-electric)
sanding block?
3) What would be a good primer/rust inhibitor to use on this area?
4) Would a primer/rust inhibitor from a spray can be a wise choice?

&lt;unsnip&gt;

If there is rust you are already down to the metal so if is not big deal to 
sand - just use what you've got - the more coarse the sand paper - the 
faster the sanding process. If you are sanding paint, you can use any grit 
but it will leave scratches in the paint that will require more sanding 
with finer grits to sand out the scratches. Or it will just require more 
coats of primer to fill the scratches. Or a combination of both.

It 'doesn't matter' what grit you use - but you have to balance sanding 
speed versus surface quality. Faster the paper the faster you sand BUT the 
more work it takes to remove the surface scratches in the paint so the top 
coat is a good quality (more sanding with finer grits and more coats of 
primer to fill the scratches).

On the other hand you could start out and continue to use only 2000 grit 
paper but you would be sanding until you were old and grey.

There is a limit to how slick you want primer so the next coat will bite or 
stick. Something along the lines of 250 grit or so. I'll let the paint 
experts comment here. Or you could check with your local friendly paint 
store fellow for information about this. Coarse enough for the paint to 
bite, slick enough that the scratches are properly filled by that next coat 
of paint or primer.

You can do all this by hand but I recommend a power sander. Again it's all 
about speed. Once you are done stripping and are starting the primer 
process trying to fine tune your bodywork I suggest you do it by hand. The 
experts can do it with a power tool, I cannot - I tend do more damage than 
good.

I have two sanders, both electric, originally purchased for woodworking. 
Both are palm sanders, one DeWalt and is a square pad, orbital sander. The 
other is a PorterCable and uses round Velcro sanding pads. It has a random 
rotating motion.

Both were about $60. The DeWalt is a slow sander with good results. The 
PorterCable is very fast and great for paint stripping.

Rust inhibitor? A good choice, I won't suggest brands. I use a water based 
type called Extend with good results. It is water based and you have to top 
coat it or it will wash away. There are better brands but this is what I 
could get on short notice locally. Check the industrial suppliers as they 
will have good rust inhibitors. Also check with your local body shop supply.

My experience with the spray can rust inhibitors has been this: the 
manufacturer has to thin the paint coming out of these cans to a point 
where it doesn't coat well without many coats. The stuff you can brush and 
the type that you could shoot through a proper spray gun would cover better 
in my opinion.

You have to balance your tooling limitations with your budget. I started 
with nothing and now about 10 years later despite the fact that my tool 
chest is last on my budget, I have accumulated some pretty nice tools and 
gained enough ability that the neighbors don't laugh at me when I pull out 
of the driveway &lt;grin&gt;.

Hope this helped. Let us know how it goes.
