Subject: [T2] Small Problem

First off let me say that I am not trying to cause trouble here.

I am just wondering if anyone else feels if they are being put aside by one 
of the on-line ordering companys?

I placed a order on 11/6/00
Got the order on 11/20/00  Well most of it.
On 12/5/00 asked if the backordered parts were not in or shipped yet to 
change them for some others, and made sure the price was very close  ( 
$0.25 difference)
On 12/6/00 was told &quot;If not shipped, I'll look to change for
the new items based upon what is in stock.&quot;
On 12/13/00 was told there was a difference of over $10.00.
On 12/13/00 Asked about the diggerence
On 12/18/00 Was told it was due to me being told wrong price on apart, and 
the shipping.
On 12/18/00 Asked about why I am paying for shipping twice?
Have not heard a word from them since.

I live on the west coast and by the time I get home from work it is three 
to four hours later on the East coast.

Just asking, and venting.

Thanks for the time.
Mike
