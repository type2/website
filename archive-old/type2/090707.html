&gt; Gotta disagree here.  Sure, be sure all seals, timing, etc, are correct, but
&gt; got to think in Gene Berg terms here.
&gt;
&gt; For one, if there are any modifications to the engine at all.different cam,
&gt; compression ratio, displacement, different carbs, or carbs on an formerly FI
&gt; engine, you no longer have a stock set up.  Modification s could be made to
&gt; improve airflow.
&gt;
&gt; Carbs will suck air first...then the remaining air goes to the fan.  Gene
&gt; Berg did dyno wind tunnel tests in the old days on a type 2 with and without
&gt; the windows down.........guess what?  When the windows were down, temps were
&gt; up and HP was down.......when they were up, all was fine.........
&gt; Unfortunately we cannot drive our busses in the heat with our windows down.
&gt;
&gt; Bottom line is, if all else is well, and your temps are up there, the scoops
&gt; could help by forcing more air into the engine compartment.

The key word here is &quot;could&quot;  It is just as likely that add-on scoops
would make things run hotter.  They did a lot of work on the stock cooling
system and if one wants to second-guess their engineering one would have
to do considerable research before cutting metal.

First question:  how thick is the boundary layer?  Will the scoop even be
in the slipstream where it can get a ram effect?  Note that the stock
inlet on a bay isn't a scoop at all, it faces mostly sideways!
