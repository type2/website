Subject: Re: [T2] truckers, buses, PLF

&gt;Y'know, I've driven I-5 and don't find that the average is anywhere near
&gt;80.  Truck speed limit is 55 and most trucks are running 60-62 or so.
&gt;Autos run 65-75.
&gt;I run around 60 so I fit in pretty well.  Yes there is the odd
&gt;speedburner who is running 80, but that isn't the flow speed.

I haven't been in that part of the country but I had done alot of 
travelling on I-81, I-75, and closer to home I-75. Speed limit is 70. 
Traffic runs 5-10 mph faster. If speed wasn't the factor on I-5 I'm happy. 
Yes our rear lighting is stinko. Bought new tailights a couple years back 
from Bus Depot. Reflectors housings are black versus the OEM light grey. 
Some silver paint is in line here!!!

Take care.

Chris
