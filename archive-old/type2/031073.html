&gt; Thanks for the tip Bob, but how would I know if I have Hydralic valves

&gt; &gt; Check to see if maybe someone put in Hydralic valves??
&gt; &gt; 

good question, one way is to push down on a push rod, hard, as solid
lifter is, well solid.  a hydralic lifter has some give to it, would feel
like pushing down a spring maybe 1/2 inch or so.  of course you could
always fish one out with a magnet, there is no mistaking them.

&gt; &gt; they are adjusted differently, you are not supposed to have em stock but?

to adjust a hdy valve.  
loosen the valve (at TDC of course)
screw the adjuster in until it just touches the valve
turn 2 full turns tighter (many suggest only one turn)
lock down.  

it needs no further adjusting, they self adjust after that.  they should
be completely quiet after that, except for some chatter when hot and
pulling a long grade.  (keep an eye on the heat, it will overheat fast
when they chatter)
