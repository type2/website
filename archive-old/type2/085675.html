Subject: Re: [T2] Locking filler door

	It might actually be 'easier' and nicer looking to fab a newer(later model) 
filler to your bus that accepts a locking cap.  I have to agree with whoever 
mentioned the damage that could be caused by the curious/reckless passerby.  
Another option would be to fabricate something like the 68'-71'(?) beetles 
had as locking doors for their gas-tank filler.

&gt; &gt; Has anyone ever tried to find a locking gas cap for the 71 style. 
&gt;Actually
&gt; &gt; it appears that a locking gas cap can't be made for this type of filler.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This leads me to my next question. Has anyone ever fabricated a lock for 
&gt;the
&gt; &gt; filler door?
