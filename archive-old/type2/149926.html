i'm guilty of coming in late on this thread but let me tell you about two
incidences with AAA within 12 months. dual relay issue put me on the side of
the road with wife and three small children aged 7 years through 18 months.
during july 04. it was 60 miles form the nearest town. long story short is
AAA arranged to have the flatbed driver persuade his mother to come out with
a mini van and grab us all at once, and take us the 60 miles.

fast forward to last may when we were on the side of the road a few miles
outside of chico. AAA driver put the whole family in the bus and on top of
the flatbed. he drove us mellow straight through town to the acvw place,
then an AIRS engine rebuild. two completed 10,000 mile trips thanks to the
auto club. AAA is alright by me.  - steve
