And he said &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;RTV silicone and thin sheets of aluminum will work if you
really, really
don't care about looks. A prime source of this aluminum is 12-ounce&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

Ya'll are really starting to sker me with repairs of this magnatuide.
Seriously debating on staying away form baywindow repairs. Please consider
other fixes  first this will bite you on  the butt later, my .02 worth ,
have been there and repaired some of this type repairs, it might be worth
.05 ,
