Subject: Re: [T2] More FI questions/woes

Race cars aren't typically concerned with emissions :-)

The idea behind EGR is to reduce the formation of oxides of nitrogen (NOx).
It turns out that NOx forms at combustion chamber temps in excess of 2000
deg F.  NOx is also a MAJOR contributor to smog.
So the way to reduce formation of NOx is to keep the combustion chamber
temps down.  EGR does this by routing some of the exhaust gases (which are
inert and do not burn) into the intake air stream.  These exhaust gases take
up some of the space that air would normally occupy which helps to control
the temperatures inside the combustion chambers.

Not only does it help reduce emissions but it keeps the heads cooler.
Sounds win-win to me.  The goal is not to cool the exhaust gases down as
that wouldn't really help anything that I know of, but to use the exhaust
gases to keep the combustion chamber temps down.

&gt; Anyone else have problems with this comment?
&gt; I've never seen a highly efficient race engine
&gt; with a pipe from the exhaust to the air cleaner.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; My understanding is that this is one of the first
&gt; things done in the name of emissions control (to
&gt; appease nonappeasable treehuggers) that
&gt; ultimately, along with bumper/airbag
&gt; requirements, that led to the demise of aircooled
&gt; VW's.
&gt;
&gt; I'm sure the exhaust gasses being rerouted to the
&gt; cylinders make the exhaust gasses cooler, hence
&gt; more complete combustion (?) with less pollution,
&gt; but I'm not sure that corresponds to the engine
&gt; running cooler, especially given the lower power
&gt; and requirements to run an engine harder, etc.
