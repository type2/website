Subject: Re: AC Blower amps???

I have got my A/C blower set up so that it pushes the air in the winter
for my gas aux heater.....well was smoking the switches so I started
running some test.....
   the A/C blower (removed the variable speeds so only runs flat out)motor
by itself is drawing almost 15amps!!  I have isolated the system and run
a cheater from power through the ammeter then direct to the motor,
isolating it from everthing.  still draws 15 amps.

the Eberspracher fired up along with the blower draws almost 30amps....

anyone with a handy A/C blower they can double check the amp draw... dern
thing spins free, I put a little lube on the shafts but had no effect.
the motor is electrically isolated, on plastic mounts etc. no leak to
ground that I can find.  just seems like a bloody lot of amps for that
little blower!?!?!?

thems a lotta electrons running around loose, nice heat but I want it from
the heater not a dashboard fire.!

THanks
Bob
hurry it's cold here in the Northeast!!!!!
