&gt;&gt;The parts you need to buy are a 30 amp relay ($3-4), 10 guage wire (need
&gt;
&gt;This type of relay is available for a buck or less if you look around:

I found another source for inexpensive relays.  MCM Electronics.
I bought something from them a couple years ago and they have been sending 
me a catalog or flyer every few days since.
Anyway... they sell these MultiComp automotive 12V relays in either 30-amp 
SPDT (5 terminal) or 40 amp SPST (4-terminal) for $1.01 each.
If you buy 10-24 the price goes down to $0.91 each
If you buy 25 or more the price goes down to $0.81 each.
How much cheaper do you want?  :-O
