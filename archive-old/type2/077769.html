Subject: black cat heater

hello again,

i purchased a black cat heater last nite, and just
judging from the &quot;test run&quot; i did in my basement, im
psyched. havent had a chance to try it in the westy
yet. 

i would like to mount it somewhere permanent (in the
back of my 76 Westy) and hook it up to a the propane
tank on my westy. ideally i would like to give it its
own tank, buts that is for someday. any ideas on where
to mount it, or how i could hook it up to the propane
tank? thanks in adance.

Matty
76 Westy &quot;Cleopatra&quot;
