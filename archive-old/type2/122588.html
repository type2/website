Subject: the last of the alternator boots

If you have a 70A (at least factory installed) the alternator boot is part
number 022 903 655.

Bus Boys has listed it as NLA for a long time but there are a small handful
of these left through the Porsche part network. I'm not sure which P model
they fit exactly because I don't have access to the fiche today but it
doesn't really matter. The price is around $23 so you can decide how much
you need one.

I formally put out a challenge to Steve Dolan to locate one after they are
gone. En garde, Monsieur Dolan!
