Subject: Re: [T2] oil leak on a 75

Bryan- There is a leetle teeny tiny rubber bellows
between the fan housing and the engine case
that is trash on your bus. The dipstick ( what's that for ? )
goes right through it. Look up and get an eye-full !

Subject: [T2] oil leak on a 75


&gt;Hello all,
&gt; i went down to pick up my new 75 westy butit was leaking oil so bad and
&gt;smoking so bad that i couldnt drive it.
&gt;It is leaking in a steady drip from the dipstick tube. when i removed the
&gt;stick from the tube it poured out. I dont have to much oil in it, the only
&gt;think I can thing is the case has to much back pressure. I am new to these
&gt;motors so I am learning, I am gonna refer to my manual as well.
&gt;Any ideas anyone?
&gt;
