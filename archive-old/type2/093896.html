&lt;&lt; no it isn't.... I wonder if the lug nuts comming off was the only
thing.  only time I had the experience the car made a horrible racket for
quite a while before we discovered the loose lug nuts.

Same deal...I had a tire shop fix a flat for me and they didn't tighten the
lug nuts; just slapped the hubcap back on. After a few blocks, the noise
was incredible, as was the vibration. I can't imagine all the bolts coming 
loose at once without some warning!
