Interesting, but there doesn't seem to be any provision for
temperature control flaps, and there will be a massive hot (and dirty)
air leak around the crank pulley.  This looks like something for the
custom show folk, not for the daily drivers.

Also, if I want to go _fast_, I'd go for something a bit quicker than
a typ 4!
