&gt; &gt;&gt; I know that i should use one shim against the case rather than a stack

&gt; &gt;when I rebuilt my 2 liter the head was flycut because it was not square
&gt; &gt;three shims under the cyl. to get (I think) .045 or so.   the heads

&gt; There is no reason to stack shims.  Rocky Mountain Motorworks sells shims
&gt; in many thicknesses - I seem to remember .015, .030, and .060 and .090
&gt; being available.  Buy the correct shim instead of stacking several.  Bob, I
&gt; can't understand why your mechanic didn't do this too.

because I told him not to, he had good spacers, we didn't know in advance
we would need em, and he assured me that under the cyl it receives no high
presure gases, and he said that in all his years of experience it never
caused a problem, and I know and trust this guy.

I was right there when we discovered the problem, and considering it would
take 3-4 days to get em in, it was my call.  if you can give me a good
reason why it is harmfull to stack shims between the case and the cyl.
I'll pull it out and change em out. 

Bob
