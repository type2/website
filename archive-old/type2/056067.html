Subject: Sold the '74

Well I sold my '74 today. It was really hard because I need the money
for my roof, so I had to settle for about a $2500 loss. Yeah that seems
like a lot I know, but I paid too much for it in the first place.

 I spent 9 months thinking &amp; breathing this vehicle while I did
everything I could to make it as reliable as possible. We then drove it
for 1.5 years until we finally gave into the temptation of A/C, heat,
and head gasket leaks, yes we bought a vanagon. I can say this. I took a
bus that was bound to be parted out, and put it back on the road in very
good condition. Did have new paint? No did it have a new engine? No. My
philosophy is more of a utilitarian type. I would rather know that my
wheel bearings are good, CVs well packed, interior insulated, etc before
I worry about cosmetics.

It now makes me question the route I am going to take in restoring my
split. It will be several days I am sure before I digest all my feelings
over this and come out with a clear perspective.

I love buying VWs, but I hate selling them.

I am not looking for pity, sympathy, empathy, or any responses. I just
wanted to vent to people that I know understand how I feel. 

Thank you for listening.
