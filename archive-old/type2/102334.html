Subject: Parting out an 81 westy

Parting out an 81 westy. Has full camper interior and pop up. Body is very
rusty. Engine is 2.0 FI and was running well, until I had a FI problem. I had
did a quick top end rebuild on it less than 400. I trouble shot it to leaky
injectors. Strong tranny. I have an 85 that I'm thinkng about putting the
interior in. If I do, I will let you know.  I also forgot to mention is has
A/C complete exept for the compressor and a BA6 gas heater which works. I'm
not sure about the switches for the heater tho, I bypassed all the switches
and it fired right up.  Email me or call with requests and offers.
216-521-6350  Though I'd put it up on the list before listing stuff on Ebay.

Mike
