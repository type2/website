&gt; I bought a mechanical fuel pump from Bus Depot ...
&gt;  I checked the fuel pressure and it pegged my gauge!
&gt;  That's 12 psi, possibly more.  It should be 5-6
&gt;
&gt; Does the Bus Depot care to comment on this?


The Brazilian pumps are pretty much the only game in town at this point, and
have been for some time.  At any given time, German pumps are either four
times the price or not available at all.  That said, I've sold a large
number of these pumps and had no complaints whatsoever.  So I have to
conclude that this is a defective pump rather than a widespread problem,
since everyone else is apparantly using the same pump problem-free.  Of
course, I'd be more than happy to replace it if you'd return it along with a
short note.
