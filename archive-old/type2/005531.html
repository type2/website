&gt;Sounds like my first opportunity to remove the engine. Have never done this
&gt;before, Bentley makes it sound easy.

The last time i looked in my Bentley manual, i was still just as baffled
as the first time i ever saw it This book goes into mind-numbing detail
insofar as repairs made with dealer-only tools and procedures which
relate to an antiseptic surgical  repair of the pristine original bus,
which , for the life of me i can't understand why it's even on the lift !
The book never mentions any of the real-life problems of engine removal
which include bent/broken/rusted/stripped/stuck nuts and bolts, as well
as the particular methods of disassembly, repair, and reassembly we have
all had to find on our own through late-nite marathons in less than perfect
laboratory conditions.
and so, for a start to the new guy, i have a couple of suggestions. it can be
an easier job if it is clean. take it to the car wash and blast it with a bunch of
quarters. money well spent. soak every fastener you can see with some
penetrating oil, at least overnite. have containers ready for the hardware,
and use them in rotation, putting the fasteners for each stage grouped
separately. number the ends of wires and  hoses and map them on paper.
don't count on your memory for these details, make notes you can understand
later, remember that down time for the unforseen additional delays is
inevitable- unless you have a well-equipped stash of spare everything...
make the work area as comfortable as possible- it is much easier to concentrate
on the  job at hand if distractions are kept to a minimum. take patience with the
difficult fasteners- if there isn't time to do the job right, you will find the time to
do it over...and good luck.
Dave
