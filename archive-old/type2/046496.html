Subject: [T2] Re: running on ???

The reason incorrect timing can cause 'run-on' is because while the engine is running with the incorrect (read: too far BTDC) timing, it runs hot - hot enough for it to run on after you turn it off.  5 bucks says that the run-on in engines that are suffering it as a result of running hot accompanied by 'pinging' or predetonation.  Not good.

My bus suffered two different types of run-on.  One was the traditional brrroooom! after you turned it off - it was running hot - maybe because of rebuild, maybe because of timing, maybe because of cooling tin leaks - Not sure.  It has stopped this for whatever reason through no action of mine - thats why i think it was related to the rebuild.

The other type of run-on was after i'd turn the key off, the alt light would come on (cuz i'd cut the ignition) but she'd actually run normally for a second or two.  I found that the reason for this was because of the way i had the aux heater fan wired in -the switch in the heater lever or the relay or something was bad, so i just bypassed it.  I had just connected it in with the power source for the fuel pump, which is coming off the coil i think. Fan would run all the time.
Well, when i'd turn off the ignition, the inertia of the fan spinning down would turn the fan motor in to a generator which would pump current back through the ignition system, keeping the engine running for a moment.
I disconnected the fan and when i turn off the key, she dies immediately.

&gt; &gt;  My engine is running on after I shut it off. I checked the archives and 
&gt; the 
&gt; &gt;  suggestions I found said that its either retarted timing or a problem with 
&gt; &gt;  the idle cutoff. 
&gt; 
&gt; I've been hearing for decades that incorrect timing can cause running on. 
&gt; I've never been able to fathom that. When an engine &quot;runs on&quot;, you've laready 
&gt; turned the ignition off!!! Timing has no meaning when there is no spark.
&gt; 
&gt; I can see that an overheated speck of carbon could cause running on (I can't 
&gt; think of anything other than an incandescant spot that COULD cause running 
&gt; on) , but is that incandescence likely to be from retarded timing?
