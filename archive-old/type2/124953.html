Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Booster ?

If you are looking for the sleeves that go inside the clear vaccum line at
every end - I jsut got a few of these from busdepot. Took a while though -
apparently they do not have them in stock regularly. If you need them right
now, I can ask my girlfriend to dig them out - my replacement hose is the
braided type so will not need them myself most likely.

I believe this is the part number for the 12mm hose sleeve: 211 611 833C
Grommet ($1.81 at Busdepot, #79 in the microfiche). I think these are the
plastic clamps used on the clear line: 211 611 403 A Clip ($1.77, #78 in the
microfich). If you need them right away - p-mail me and my girlfriend can
send mine to you. I have six of each.

#63 is a grommet of some sort (maybe a bracket) in the fresh air line
somewhere around the wheel arch.

I could not find #76. If my memory serves me correctly - there is the nipple
in the booster that the line connects to. Sleeve #79 is slide into the end
of the line and the while thing is clamped with #78. Same thing for all
connections, including the check valve and the manifold or balance tube
connections.

&gt; &gt; &gt;There should be a rubber sleeve in each end of the plastic tube. I
&gt;think it
&gt; &gt; &gt;is #63 in this pic:
&gt; &gt; http://homepage.mac_dot_com/ratwell/Microfiche/t205110.gif
&gt; &gt; Does that mean that it would attach to the nipple on the booster and
&gt; &gt; and
&gt;#76
&gt; &gt; would go over that?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Is there anybody that has replaced these lately or know anyone that might
supply them? For clarification:
I am looking for the rubber bushings or sleeves that work with the Brake
Booster Ridgid Plastic Vacuum Lines. 12mm and 17mm.
Thanks,
