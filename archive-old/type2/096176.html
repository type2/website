Subject: Re: [T2] Used Mexican Bus?

&gt; My girlfriend and i are talking about driving around mexico someday in

&gt; to buy one there, drive it around, then sell it there. Any idea what
&gt; busses go for down there? Comparative prices to here? Cheaper? More
&gt; expensive? If a new Brazilian is $8000 then maybe a 30 year old used
&gt; in Mexico might be cheap? Any legal issues involved? Thanks Wink

I would check with the Mexican consulate for information, I know this can
be done in some European countries but you may need to have a Mexican
address, and/or drivers license and/or insurance  each country is
different
