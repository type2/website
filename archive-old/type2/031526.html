&gt; Ok, let's do the salt water test.
&gt; You apply POR-15 on an aluminum plate, and I'll do the same with zinc
&gt; chromate.
&gt; And then let's scratch the aluminum, in let's say a month.
&gt; The POR-15 won't even stick to the aluminum, and the plate will be white

Hello, sorry if I got your trade wrong, my apologies.

We were talking about steel however... NOTHING bonds well to aluminum,
without exceptional preapration.  As soon as aluminum is exposed to air,
it oxidizes, and that oxide pretty much will make anything not stick
properly. So, a paint for aluminum has to be different to deal with this
phenomenon, or aluminum has to be painted in an oxygen free
environment. comparing paint for steel to paint for aluminum is an apples
and oranges thing in my decidedly non-expert opinion.

My bus is steel, the POR15 seems to stick to steel just fine.  If you have
an aluminum bus, my apologies, but this is a bus list and I have yet to
see anything but steel as a VW bus cargo floor. So, if you doubt my real
world experience with POR-15 go ahead and test it for corrosion on steel,
but as it wasnt designed for aluminum, using a test on aluminum plate,
when its intended use is steel is kind of silly, Dont you think?

I really don't care if I am believed or thought to be full of hooey, the
product, so far, has worked for me. If you wish to do differently, that is
fine.  Everyone else, do some research for yourself, maybe experiment,
paint a rusty piece of pipe and throw it in the backyard for a year. try
to scratch the paint off... Decide for yourself if its snake oil or a good
product.  That is what i did.

take care,

Steve
