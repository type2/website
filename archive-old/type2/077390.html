Subject: '72-'74 exhaust on a '77

After ~3 years of dealing with the custom fabricated system from the PO, I'm 
going to re-do my exhaust system from head to tail pipe.  Knowing that the 
'77 era system is NLA, I wanted to go with the '72-74 heater boxes &amp; 
muffler. I've searched around the archvies but have only read of this as a 
easy bolt-up alternative from Ron at BusDepot.  In speaking with another 
vendor yesterday (Bus-Boys), they couldn't confirm that it'd work. The 
concern they had was that if the 2.0l in my '77 was wider/narrower than the 
1700/1800 in '72-'74, the muffler wouldn't line up with the heater boxes. 
They didn't say it wouldn't work, they just didn't want to sell me something 
that they weren't sure would work.

I would very much appreciate any feedback from anybody who has done this
installation- does it bolt right up, are there suggestions, advice, etc.?

I'd also appreciate any feedback (pmail if appropriate) on the quality of 
the materials and timeliness of goods received from the various list
vendors.

I have access to a heated garage for a narrow (week) period in late December 
and I can't risk it not arriving by then.

Thanks kindly

Patrick
