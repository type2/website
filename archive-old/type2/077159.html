Subject: Re: [T2] Engine-neering - combustion chamber question

MIKEMELBROOKS_at_aol_dot_com sends:

&gt; Here in the UK  one of the latest go faster product is a fibre glass rap to
&gt; go around exhaust pipes to help keep the air coming into the engine cooler
&gt; (cooler air is more dense so gives more power)

That fiberglass wrap is usually used to cut down the temperature in the
engine compartment--race cars have used it for years.

You want cooler air, get one of those cold air induction things which is
basically a hose sticking out the front of your car with a funnel on it to
guide the air into the hose. (I would show you one on a Miata, but the guy
took it off his site.)
