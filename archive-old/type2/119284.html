Subject: RE: [T2] Upgrade to Electric Water Pump in Sink

&gt; Is there a way to change my manual sink pump to an electric one?

Sure. You'll need an electric pump and a faucet that has a switch for
it. The parts from a later model bus with (that came with this setup)
should work. (Links below.) However, you may have to fabricate a small
blockoff plate, since the hole in your countertop for the your existing
faucet is a different size/shape from the base of the later style
faucet. Shouldn't be hard to do.
