X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL - A

Glue the formica to the piece you are recovering (if that
is indeed what you are doing) cut it a bit over sized. then
trim to the piece you are covering with a router. They sell
bits for this. High speed, fine teeth like a rasp file
almost.. the part that acts as a guide against the piece
being covered is either smooth or has a wheel guide with
bearings. More expensive but easier to use IMHO
 Practice on a scrap mockup first.

&gt; The formica is about 1/2 mm thick and is very brittle so 
it is hard to cut
&gt; without chipping.

Try a plywood blade in a skill saw set for a shallow cut 
or, better yet, a table
saw with a slow feed rate.
