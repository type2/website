Subject: The Dreaded Day hath come...

Ah... the Dreaded Day hath finally come.

My faithful 2-liter engine, that lugged the wife, me and the dog all over
this country and back several times, has finally up and died. I knew I had
major problems when the oil leaks grew to 1.5 feet in diameter nearly every
time I stopped the westy.
I take solace in the fact that I bought a 1978 in 1994 with what I am 99.9
percent sure was the orginal motor, and was able to coax another 60,000
miles out of it. And the fact that I'll have a NEW (!) motor.
Okay, that off my flat-broke chest, here's the question:
Anybody gotten an engine from Tom Noble in Seattle? If so, how has it
fared?
That's the source I've scoped for Kermit's new heart. My bro got a new 1600
from there, and has had little if any trouble with it, but I wonder about
their pancakes. Not the kind you smother with syrup, of course, but the
kind you fill with 20-50w. I'm excited to have a new motor in the van --
sheesh, I plan to give it to my son (now 13 months) when he's old enough to
drive, er, appreciate it.
I'm having a guy in Seattle do the swap. He's worked on my cars for about
10 years. I usually do the weenie work myself -- fuel filter replacements,
oil changes, brakes, minor body repair, push rod tube seals -- but I've
relied on him for the stuff where I could tell I'd be getting in over my
head. That's just part of owning a VW and loving it, from someone who's
owned everything from bugs to rabbits to buses and everything in between:
Knowing your limits. And mine end at pulling the engine.
Anyway, I trust the mechanic to do a good job. I just wondered what you
folks have heard about Tom Noble's engines. Plunking down $3K all told for
the engine, labor, clutch and so forth is a bigger investment than I would
have chosen to make right now, given my druthers -- I guess I just want to
&quot;feel good&quot; about it. The engine itself will be just under $2K, outfitted
new right to the heads, and warranteed to 12,000/12 months.

In celebratory mourning,
Jeff
