Good write up on these coolers, Robert! Do have two things to add: our
cheapie &quot;home made&quot; camper with 77 engine that we bought last year has an
RVEECO type...ugly as sin...mounted externally below drivers side scoop.PPO
drove it to Mexico numerous times, we have about 11K on it already.....and
nary a dent by acts of nature or by punks.

Our thermostat is set for 180 deg. apparently..and our temps run about like
yours, in Fla, and WNC mountains. I wouldn't bother putting one in a
pancake..but I haven't taken this one off either :)
