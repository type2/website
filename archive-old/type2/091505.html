Subject: ADMIN Re: [T2] VW Trademarks


I've been asked by a couple of listees if this thread is valid VW bus
content.  It does seem to have settled into a gripe session (in which I
have done my share of griping!)

So, unless we can contribute something new (and hopefully relating to bus
technical issues), let's consider the thread ended.
