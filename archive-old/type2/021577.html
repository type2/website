Hi John- if it were me, waiting to find the seat hold down dogs, I'd do
a quick way to hold the seat -make the t at the bottom out of a 5/16&quot; or
3/8&quot; cap or carriage bolt about 2.5&quot; long, grinding down 2 sides until
you can slip it in.  At the top, use a piece of steel 3/4 or 1&quot; bar
stock (home depot) thicker than 1/8&quot;. Drill it to allow it to slip over
the bolt- bend the other end to form a hook around the bar. I'd stick it
into a vise with the hole the right distance in the jaw and then bend it
using a hammer, thern cut it off. Use a thick washer above that and then
the nut.   If the mount holes are opposite each other, then use the bar
stock in one piece, drilled at each end for the bolts.  Safer that way,
can'd slip off the seat tube.   MB
