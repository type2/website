Hello all,

I need to clear some space soon so...I'm dropping the price on my
project pick up.  It has light rust and a couple of rust holes in the
bed.  The body is pretty straight but one of the gates has a small dent.
It needs paint, engine rebuild, and head/tail lights.  has the original
front and rear bumpers.  has a crack in one of the wind shields.
original 6 volt.  original 15&quot; rims.  beautiful uncut dash with radio
block off plate.  I can email pictures if any one is interested.  

Please respond via p-mail.
