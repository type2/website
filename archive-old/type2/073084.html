Subject: Type I Engine Pull, frozen pilot bearing?


Not long ago on one of the lists somebody mentioned having the output shaft
freeze or bind in the pilot bearing, and somebody else sez &quot;good luck
getting the engine out if that happens&quot;. I wasn't paying much attention.

I think that happened to me. Lately the clutch hasn'f felt right and
yesterday I started getting throwout bearing noise so today I am pulling
the engine out of the 68. That sucker just is not coming. I hate to pry at
the engine/trans joint but I can't think what else to do. Suggestions
appreciated.
