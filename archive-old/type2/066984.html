Subject: F.S. '63-'67 bus middle seat salt&amp;pepper

For sale: '63-'67 bus 2/3rds or &quot;shorty&quot; middle seat for walkthru models, grey
salt &amp; pepper, excellent cond., no rips or split seams.

Ok, here's the scoop. At a show this summer, I met a guy who said he has a
&quot;platinum&quot; ( ie. gold / brown salt &amp; pepper) short middle seat for a '66-'67
deluxe walkthru like mine, that he's selling, though he didn't have it with him.
Since my '67 has the gold / brown salt &amp; pepper and not the grey salt &amp; pepper,
I asked him if he would like to just trade seats, and then continue to sell my
grey s&amp;p seat, and I'd get his gold s&amp;p seat, since he'd probably have an easier
time selling the grey one than the gold ( more buses were made w/ grey s&amp;p ) but
he said he just wanted to sell it and that was that.  So I asked him how much he
wanted for it, and he said $200.   Well, I wasn't going to buy another middle
seat and have 2 middle seats, when I already had one that was real nice except
for the fact that it was the wrong upholstry for my bus. 

So I need to sell this one first and use the money I get from it to buy the gold
one. 
anyone interested?
I'm in the Allentown, Pa. area.

p.s.- I'm also looking for some nice gold s&amp;p front walthru driver &amp; pass. seats
for a '66-'67 deluxe. This upholstry type came only on the velvet green or
titian red deluxe models. 
know of any?
