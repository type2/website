Subject: will it work?

------_=_NextPart_001_01C1E10D.AF1A85E0

Hi all,

I was wondering about whether it is possible to use the
oil pressure switch as a means for cutting out the points
and saving the engine if/when the oil pressure disappears ...

Here's my theory ... add a wire from the pressure switch
to the live side of the points (at the coil say). When
the oil pressure is nil, the switch is closed and the points
are effectively shorted out, so no spark, no load on the 
motor, etc. And when you start up in the morning, she won't
fire until the oil pressure is up, which only takes a second
or two anyhows. That's gotta be good, right?

The drawbacks as far as I can figger are that 
(a) the idiot light will probably glow while you drive (brightness 
will be proportional to the dwell angle of the points),
(b) the back-voltage from the coil/points might fry the idiot light, and
(c) the coil might overheat if you leave the ignition on when
the motor isn't running (but you got this risk anyway if the points 
happen to be closed when the motor stops)

The first two problems can probably be overcome by strategically placing a 
high-voltage diode in series with the wire from the oil switch
to the points. 

Has anyone ever tried this? Will it work?
