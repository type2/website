&gt;  A question for the Brits:
&gt;  
&gt;  I have seen pictures of Devon conversions that have a small cabinet in 
&gt;  the rear corner. This is not a full-sized closet. It starts at the 
&gt;  waistline of the bus and terminates at the headliner. About 4&quot;-6&quot; deep at 
&gt;  its deepest point. Door hinged at the bottom. 
&gt;  
&gt;  What was this cabinet designed to be used for?
&gt;  
&gt;  TIA

Hi Mark,

I assume you mean a cupboard like the one in the rear left (in UK usualy on 
the right but I've got an LHD) of my camper van as in 
www.soft_dot_net_dot_uk/vwt2oc/BWallace/pictures/r950vhy/19990509/p6.jpg ?

These are 'officialy' wardrobes. In the UK to be registered as a camper van 
you must have a 6 foot long bed, a wardrobe and a watertank. I don't think 
you have to have a fixed stove or sink; and some of these requirements have 
changed with time.

The bed, wardrobe, and watertank is what most UK insurance companies expect 
to find in a camper too.

Inside the cupboard you refer to there will be a short bar high up near the 
roof going across the van, this is to hang coat hangers on; and there is 
sufficient height to hang a shirt or jacket in there (but ladies must leave 
their ball gowns at home)

Probably most people just use these as cupboards with stuff stacked up which 
falls out when you open the door:-)

Good luck
