Subject: Getting a rebuilt engine

I type this with a great deal of fear, as I am sure quite a few listees 
will think I am an idiot for doing this, but I have decided to get a 
rebuilt engine for my Bus.  (My husband had previously posted that we 
were unsure if we should do this.)  I would now like to get some 
recommendations as to the best source(s) to look for one.  I know in a 
perfect world (one where I didn't have two little kids to raise and a 
job working twelve hour night shifts that requires me to sleep all day, 
a big house to clean, blah, blah, blah...) I would tackle the rebuilding 
myself, but  I can't deal with renting a car for as long as that would 
take, and believe me, it would take LONG!  My first instinct is to go 
with the Bus Depot but I am open to other suggestions.  Thanks again, 
Beth in NJ
