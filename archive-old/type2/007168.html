Well I disconnected the brake booster without success.  I'm going to
continue working my way through my carb mounting and intake.  Idle
adjustment doesn't seem to raise the idle above 850 to 900 rpm.  I may
replace the intake center section and ends. Reason being the mating
surfaces of each are less than desirable.  The intake I picked up at the
yard doesn't seem to be for a 71 bus.  Some time ago I took it to a
local shop to have them replace it with the correct one.  Problem was
the clearance between the accelerator pump and the generator. Carb
wouldn't seat properly.  They resolved it be grinding a notch in the
generator which I wasn't particularly pleased about.
Being an apartment dweller in Seattle, It's getting really old doing
these repairs on the street.  This results in more work being done at
the shop when I get frustrated.  But with results of shop performance
such as described above, I hate taking her there.  Hmmm, anyone one have
spare garage space?
Anyway, I'm going to give the intake a good once over this weekend and
nail down the possible leak. If no leak, I don't know what to look for
next.
