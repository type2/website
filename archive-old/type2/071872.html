Hi everyone,

Over the last week or so, I have noticed that it is harder and harder to get my shifter to engage into first gear and even second- 3rd and 4th are fine.  When I go to shift into reverse, I've noticed some grinding, too (I think that could be unrelated to the shifter).

So, is there someplace I can lube the shifter ball bearings?  Some people have said it could be then clutch, but I'd like to try the path of least resistance first ;O)

Thanks!

Peter
