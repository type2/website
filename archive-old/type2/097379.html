Addendum:

I removed the flywheel to mount the engine on my stand.  If you want the
flywheel with the engine (I assume you do) I'll loosely re-assemble it to
the engine but not torque it down in case you want to change out the front
seal.

&gt; Hi all:
&gt;
&gt; Since I have a rebuilt TypeIV sitting in my garage I'm selling the engine
&gt; out of my recently acquired '82 Westfalia.
&gt;
&gt; I drove the van with this engine in it exactly twice: the first was a 30
&gt; minute or so test drive on city streets and freeways, the second was the
15
&gt; minute drive home.  My impression of this engine was &quot;strong.&quot;  That's
&gt; obviously a seat-of-the pants impression, but I've driven my '81 Vangon
over
&gt; these same hills and dales and freeways and the car seemed to move out
every
&gt; bit as strong as my '81.  Both drives were during a period where we were
&gt; experiencing record heat, but the &quot;dipstick test&quot; indicated no overheating
&gt; of the engine.
&gt;
&gt; The engine has a new left-side head that couldn't have more than 100-200
&gt; miles on it.  The owner said that the head cost a little over $300, and
&gt; that's about right.
&gt;
&gt; The engine has a sound coming from it that sure sounded like a lifter not
&gt; pumping up, but, if that's the case, it didn't pump up during either
drive.
&gt; In any case the noise sure doesn't sound like a rod knock or something of
&gt; that sort.
&gt;
&gt; My wife, who followed my home after the purchase, reported a small puff of
&gt; smoke coming from the tailpipe in situations when I was decelerating.
Since
&gt; I didn't even notice it during the initial test drive we're not talking
the
&gt; Exxon Valdez here.
&gt;
&gt; About an eighth of the top fin on #4 cylinder is broken.
&gt;
&gt; Now you know exactly as much as I do about this engine!
&gt;
&gt; I've done a &quot;medium&quot; job of cleaning the exterior of the engine, so you
&gt; won't be presented with a complete pig of an oil-soaked engine.
&gt;
&gt; I'll palletize and box the engine for shipping.  If the purchaser lives
near
&gt; an Amtrak with freight capabilities and chooses to ship that way (fairly
&gt; cheap, in my experience) I'll take the engine to the Oakland station.
&gt;
&gt; Asking price is $500, plus actual shipping cost charged by the carrier,
plus
&gt; $10.
&gt;
&gt; I know that a picture *isn't* worth a thousand words when buying an engine
&gt; over the internet, but I've posted 2 pictures of the engine at:
