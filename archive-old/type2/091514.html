I see a lot of these posts lately.  Keep in mind that seats are pretty
easily rebuilt with new upholstery and padding and *no* sewing skills are
required.  While it's not a Recaro, the ergos of the stock bus seats are
pretty good if the upholstery and padding are fresh.

Buses have rather unique seating needs.  You sit virtually upright, and
the semi-reclining seats from conventional cars often aren't suited for a
bus.

I'd much rather have new upholstery on the old seats than half-worn-out
uphostery on seats that are not well-suited to the bus.
