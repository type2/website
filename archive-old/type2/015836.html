&gt;A neighbor came up to me today and asked if I would want his

&gt;I know that they fit, so I said yeah I want them, he offered them for 
&gt;50 bucks for the two of em, is that much? seems like it to me. 
&gt;ps if anyone lives near the dc area like me, and has two front seats 
&gt;or even one, that they dont need and are willing to let go for less 
&gt;than 50 for a pair, please let me know ...email me at 
&gt;joshua_lowell_at_hotmail_dot_com if possible...

Egads man... give him the $50!  If you need them and if they are in decent
shape then you should consider it to be the bargain of the century.
