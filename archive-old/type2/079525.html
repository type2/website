Subject: Re: [vwbusuk] Honest!

Have you seen the new Blink 182 clip for the song
&quot;First Date&quot; with the red and white samba?
Very cool:-)
There's also a TV show on out here called &quot;The Lone
Gunmen&quot; based around the newspaper that Fox Mulder
used to get resources from in &quot;The X Files&quot;
They have a green and white Panel, a 72 I think that
has, cop this, retractable licence plates.
VERY COOL! :-)
Cheers
Andrew Wood
