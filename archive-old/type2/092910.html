Subject: Re: [T2] Kerosene: - NO VW

A simple, free 55 gallon barrel. It was originally used to deliver paint.

It was two (or three?) holes in the top which I used for a bottom. I 
removed the bottom with a Sawz-all.

I placed the barrel on 2&quot; thick masonry spacers to hold it off the ground. 
I used 3 to keep it from wobbling.

I simply removed the small and large plugs that were originally used to 
fill and pump out the paint inside.

With paper or wood or cardboard inside and the bottom free of ash it will 
burn very, very hot. If I let the ash build up so it blocks the air flow it 
smokes like crazy.

I try to fill the barrel up with sticks that I collect from the yard and 
other carpentry waste (I do carpentry on the side). I use alot of wood to 
build small projects that other folks would consider to be scrap. I try to 
large burns so it gets good and hot.

To burn the kerosene I simply put it in a metal can like a large coffee can 
in the bottom of the barrel or I use it to pour over the wood and fuel the 
fire start.

Nothing complicated. Maybe a bit of air injection with a leaf blower soon! 
&lt;grin&gt;

We have a county trash &quot;transfer-station&quot; where I can take my household 
garbage. They compact it there and take it to the county landfill. They 
accept oil, metal, and large household junk. They discourage wood and other 
building materials. They have one older fellow that is easy to get along 
with and another that is pretty particular about what you dump - it is his 
kingdom and his rules.

We burned our trash in Italy but the stink was pretty bad. I don't know if 
something fancy like a fan or blower for  air injection would burn the 
trash hot enough to eliminate the stink. Something to experiment with.

&gt;Tell me about your burn barrel... I live in the country and burn barrel 
&gt;oil disposal would be ideal. (If I can mitigate the smell...)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Anything that I can't recycle easily gets poured over the &quot;bills&quot; and 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;sticks that are in the burn barrel in the back yard. All goes away.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Goes Away?!  Are you serious? Please enlighten us as to where it goes 
&gt;&gt;&gt;and what form it takes. It seems you've stumbled upon the answer to the 
&gt;&gt;&gt;environmental crisis.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;But as long as it's easy.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;We have oil recycling here but often they get fussy about taking Kerosene 
&gt;&gt;or Diesel. I don't know what the rules are so I don't know if they are 
&gt;&gt;supposed to or not. I have in the past mixed it with the waste oil when I 
&gt;&gt;had enough.
&gt;&gt;I can put it in the burn barrel though and burn it. I'm certainly not 
&gt;&gt;going to put in my gas tank - we tried that when I lived overseas. You 
&gt;&gt;can burn it but the car doesn't make but a portion of the power it should 
&gt;&gt;and naturally it's not good for the engine (I have run a VW 40 HP engine 
&gt;&gt;on a mix of lacquer thinner, kerosene, gasoline, diesel, carb cleaner, 
&gt;&gt;STP, etc. etc. It was a time of necessity and it worked but I only made 
&gt;&gt;about 1/2 of the normal power).
&gt;&gt;I have two choices at my house - burn it or dump it in the ground. So I 
&gt;&gt;burn it. And it goes away...
&gt;&gt;Not the ideal solution but like I said - it beats pouring it in the ground.
&gt;&gt;I do have a good burn barrel. With some experimentation I was able to 
&gt;&gt;regulate the air flow so that it burns very, very hot. Much of the time 
&gt;&gt;the wood and paper that gets burned in there leaves no ash hardly and it 
&gt;&gt;burns so hot that there is very little smoke and no smell. I'm going to 
&gt;&gt;experiment with attaching my leaf blower to it and see what air injection 
&gt;&gt;does for the process.
&gt;&gt;I recycle my plastics, paper (that isn't full of account numbers), 
&gt;&gt;cardboard, and oil. The garbage goes in the county dumpster and we try to 
&gt;&gt;create as little waste as we can. I'm far from the success of the folks 
&gt;&gt;in my Mother Earth News magazine but I know we are doing much better than 
&gt;&gt;most of the suburban people we know.
&gt;&gt;We do not buy stuff to use up and throw away half used like most folks do 
&gt;&gt;with cars, electronics, and such. We buy things that last and we treat 
&gt;&gt;them very carefully. I get 200K+ out of my cars and I never sell them 
&gt;&gt;'cause I am tired of them - but because they are worn out. My VW has 190K 
&gt;&gt;miles and with the fresh rebuild of it I hope to see 400K miles. I fix my 
&gt;&gt;cars up the best I can, am careful not to mis-represent them when I sell 
&gt;&gt;them as anything but a 200K+ car and sell them. My last Honda I misjudged 
&gt;&gt;as well worn at 198K miles. I still see it occasionally. It looks very 
&gt;&gt;good and has 255K+ miles on it. My current 1999 Honda (purchased new - 
&gt;&gt;never do that again!!!) I expect/plan to get 300K miles out of. Much 
&gt;&gt;better than the typical 125K most of the people I know get out of a car 
&gt;&gt;before they find themselves bored with it and begin lusting after a new 
&gt;&gt;car payment - - - I mean car...
