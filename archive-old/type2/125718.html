&lt;&lt; The point is, you're reading the FRAM BOX. Of course they'll say their own
product is the best. Crank up the VCR and video tape several automobile
commercials of different manufactures so you can watch them all back to

safety features than all the others. It's called advertising.

&quot;Rollover&quot;, she ran across the street and sat next to my
neighbor's Ford Explorer... ;-(
