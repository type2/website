Subject: Re: [T2] re help adjusting the hydraulic valves-BostonBob's
  tome

All this talk about adjusting hyd valves is getting me worried.
I have one of those engines and my compression is good
and equal to each cylinder.  It seems to run good.
should i worry or not fix it if it ain't broke?
thanks

&gt;The principle of a Hydraulic lifter is to adjust the loading so it is in

&gt;2mm as I recall; the 2 turns puts this in the middle.  Too few turns and
&gt;you risk the piston slapping the snap ring

Too many turns is dangerous (first symptom - low compression or burned valve)
Too few turns is safe (first symptom - valvetrain noise)
