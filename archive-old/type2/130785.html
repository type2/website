&gt; I have a 68 Westy and I am looking to install a tachometer in the gauge

&gt; VDO
&gt; 333-032  for 4 cyl 7000RPM  tach that does measure 3 1/8th work 
&gt; properly?

I just installed a 3 1/8 VDO tach in my '76's instrument cluster.  I 
used the tach mounting ring from Bus Boys to mount it.  Ordered the 
tach from cip1.  Almost looks stock.
