&gt; One of my parts on my 78 type 2 exhaust broke.  I need heater boxes

&gt; fabrication involved.  I was going to have my mechanic put this on but
&gt; he is not going to want to do any modifications.  do all the heating
&gt; channels line up right.

I did it and the exhaust stuff all lined up, I didn't have any problems
putting it on.   I have removed all the engine heating gear so don't know
how well it would line up.. (have gas heater for 100% of the heat)
