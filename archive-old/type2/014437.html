&gt;It may have a bigger impact on the handling of a lighter weight vehicle.

That's just it.  MY Bus isn't all that heavy.  It's a standard, non-camper
1976 which is listed in the manual at under 3100 pounds.  With the middle
seat gone, it's less.  I usually do not carry heavy loads.  When I do, the
Bus seems more stable anyway.

Considering that most of the weight is at the rear, the front end probably
weighs about what the front of my Miata does!  Given that the front of the
Bus has much more surface area than the front of the Miata, you can see the
problem.
