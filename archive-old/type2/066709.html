Subject: After Market Seat Belts

&gt;Hi Andy,

&gt;Those JC Whit retractibles sound like the ticket.  Some questions I have
&gt;are: do they adjust well with the seat full forward?  Did you have to make
&gt;any mods at all to make them work in the bus? Is the retractible mechanism
&gt;well enough out of the way for door closing?  (Just checking before I drop
&gt;$200 on a set :)

&gt;Thanks,

Hi Ron.

Those retractable seat belts DO adjust well. They are more than long enough to
fit around a large (250# +) individual with the seats fully foreward (in a '72).
As a matter of fact, I have considered shortening mine about 12&quot; so they always
draw up tight. The retracting mechanism *just barely* fits between the seat and
the stock door panels. I think the only modification I might have made was to
enlarge one of the mounting holes in the bracket that came with the seat belt to
get it moved in closer to the seat. That and I flipped the bracket around so the
mounting bolt is directly below the retractor rather than beside/behind it.
Other than that it was all nuts &amp; bolts. BTW, I was left with a nice assortment
of very large nuts, bolts and washers, since the seatbelts came with everything
needed to mount them into a car without existing seatbelts.
