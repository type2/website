&gt;&gt;It should only work during part throttle

&gt;I agree, David, but think we now have to make a distinction between
&gt;types of EGR valves.  The '78 2.0 has a strictly mechanical EGR
&gt;activation via direct linkage to the throttle bellcrank, and I think
&gt;other late loafs used an electrically actuated EGR valve.

Oops.  That's what I get for commenting on something that I have no direct
experience with.  Sorry for the misinformation - I move that my post be
struck from the archives!  :)
