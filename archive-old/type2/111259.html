&gt; &gt;Don't some of the more experimental electric cars use a motor at each

&gt; &gt;and down hill conditions... ?-)
&gt;
&gt; I think the Honda Insight and the Toyota Prius already are doing this.
&gt; Starter / alternator in place of the flywheel?

Not nearly the same thing.  The Honda/Toyota hybrids are conventional cars
with a electric motor/generator between the engine and transmission.  The
motor/generator stores energy upon braking and returns the energy for
acceleration, which improves in-town fuel economy.

Oddly enough, the conventional VW TDI diesel gets nearly the same mileage
with a lot less complexity.

A full hybrid design puts motors in the wheel hubs, eliminating the
entire mechanical drive train and braking system.  You gain a more complex
electrical system, but you lose the transmission, differential, drive
shafts and hydraulic braking systems.  You also get AWD, since you need
to put motor/generators on all four wheels for braking.  Unfortunately,
this approach is much more unconventional and therefore unattractive to
manufacturers.
