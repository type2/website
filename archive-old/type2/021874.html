Subject: Re: [T2] Oil cooler lines

Speculation session:
&quot;The best oil cooling setup would simply take oil from the sump, run it
through a cooler, and return it to the sump.  This would entail another
oil pump or perhaps a dual pump as installed in the autostick bug.  This
way the bearings would not have the restriction of the cooler in the
path and would always see full pressure.&quot;
FWIW, I had a 71 Westy wherein I added an oil cooler forward of the
engine.    I braised 1/2&quot; lines to the sump plate so oil would be pulled
from the sump through an oil filter, the cooler, and up the pickup
tube.  Used a  pressure gauge and noticed no changes except after
changing the oil- took a bit longer to build pressure due to the filter.
