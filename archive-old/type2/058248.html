Subject: Long starter bolt doesn't attach to anything
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Follow up to my &quot;hot start&quot; problem ... when I took the starter out, the top
(long) bolt was completely loose ... when I put it back in, I attempted to
tighten it up and found that it slid all the way in without hitting any
threads like it was not long enough (it is the correct bolt, I checked it
against one of the bolts from the junked buses).  I tighened the bottem bolt
nice and tight and slid the top one in the hole all the way.  This bus is a
74 automatic, but the original engine was burned up in a fire and was
replaced by a 2.0L w/ carb.  What is the deal w/ this is it the different
motor or what???

Thanks!
