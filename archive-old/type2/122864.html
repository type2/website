Subject: problem with fire extinguishers 

Even if you have a fire extinguisher when that baby catches on fire the idea
of opening up the engine door when there are flames is scary.  We had just
finished a 1000-mile trip and were less than a mile from home when up she
went.  Got the wife, two kids, and the dog out and by then the idea of
opening the engine compartment to use the extinguisher was frightening.   I
like the idea suggested earlier of a system that is built in with hoses in
the engine compartment.  Oh, and yes it never did blow, although the tires
made a hellofa noise when they blew.
