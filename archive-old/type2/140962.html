Subject: Re: [T2] Heat and lack of....

The problem is that barely anyone maintains them properly. When is the last
time you check the combustion chamber for internal corrosion? The German T\V
requires the heat exchangers on the gas heaters to be replaced every ten
years. Otherwise you have to remove the heater from the vehicle.
Consequently, the heaters are cheap on German ebay but you rarely see them
installed in VWs legally. A lot of them are un- and re-installed every two
years around inspection time ...
