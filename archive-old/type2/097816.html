Subject: Re: [VB] BN4 fuel pump

it's been in the teens the last couple nights here and I am thinking again 
about that eberspa:cher BN4 with the bad fuel pump I have.   I remember 
someone saying how you could order a new fuel pump from Espar (the current 
incarnation of Eberspa:cher)for them.  It would be electric, not the same 
kind as the original, but appropriate for the heater.   Anyone remember what 
the deal on that was?  I think the cost was about $30.

 an old rotted fuel pump they'd be willing to part with?
 Please let me know.
 OR....
 Has anyone successfully installed a low volume/psi 
 electric fuel pump from a flaps?
 if so, what psi/volume should I look for?
