Subject: [T2] 1776 &amp; 34 PICT-3

We are being treated to a preview of winter in Northern VA this weekend.
The 1776 with dual Kadrons which I inherited from the PO of my '71 Westy,
and which I rebuilt over the past nine months, does not seem to like cool
weather.  A good deal of popping for the first five minutes after startup.


 I need a choke.  I'm considering removing the Kadrons and putting on the
34 PICT-3 which I have in my pile.  I'm sure this will reduce the power a
bit but I'm hoping the startability and driveability will more than make up
for that.

Has anyone run this combination? Any advice?

Thanks, Jack
