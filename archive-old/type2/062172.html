Subject: Help with push rod tubes

 Hey everybody!!        

        I am going to undertake the task of stopping the oil 
stains that our 80 westy just loves to leave behind. Could 
any body tell me, Do the push rod tube slide out through 
the head? Do I need to remove the head to get to them? What 
sealant should I use?   



Thanks,
R&amp;R GREAKER
