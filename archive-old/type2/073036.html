Drove a 73 Bus today. It was in great shape, so I am trying to get a
handle on its worth, any help is appreciated.

Engine looked clean and ran smooth. I barely got it to 70 mph, is this a
problem or indication of one? I drive about 700 freeway miles per mont.
A/C blows but must need freon b/c no cold air came out.

Thanks,
