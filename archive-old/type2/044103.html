Subject: [T2] Re:Various Starter Problems

I have had starter problems for the past 12 years on my '77 Westfalia.
Typically with a hot engine: no start, just the hum.  I developed a work
around that ALWAYS got me on the road again by installing a push button
switch that crosses the starter terminals...I mounted this in the engine
compartment.  

Today, however, I installed a genuine Robert Bosch relay kit (about $8) made
just for hot start problems in older VWs.  It mounts near the starter and is
very easy to install, about 30 minutes.  Good instructions, pictures; goof
proof.  I would think lots of people are having this problem for Bosch to
put together this kit.

I haven't used mine enough to know yet whether it will always work, so I
cannot submit a road report just yet.  Personally, I would consider this fix
or a push button before I attempted to make some sort of heat shield.
(Since the starter is bolted to the engine/transmission case it is going to
heat up from conduction...I think the problem resides in the ignition switch
and long wire runs that have become less electrically conductive as the van
ages.  Heat exacerbates the problem re: conductivity and so too does
humidity.  The relay in effect acts like my push button switch to get around
the poor connections)
