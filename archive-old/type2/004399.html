My suggestions, in no particular order:

1.	Check/replace the rubber boots at the manifold ends.
2.	Check that the breaker plate in the dizzy (assuming stock vac/mech dizzy)
rotates freely.
3.	Check that the vacuum advance can (assuming stock dizzy) is good.
4.	Check brake vacuum line and vacuum servo for leaks.
5.	Check carb for proper idle and choke adjustments.

Hello All,
A few questions for the experts!  71 Westy, dies at stop.  Doesn't
matter, warm or cold.  Timing, points, valves etc adjusted or replaced
500 miles ago. Looking for hints as to what to investigate.
Many thanx!
Frank
71 Happy Bus
