X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Its now Friday in Wichita, KS, USA and I have been dealing with High
School Marching Band students who snip at each other in small, but
polite ways, over issues that have a tremendous amount of importance to
themselves but not necessarily anyone else.  I  began reading my list
digest and came across this little discussion regarding busses
overheating and was reminded of a true tale of two brothers, both owning
VWs.  One brother, John, is as meticulous an individual as you might
meet when it comes to cars. He was a factory trained VW mechanic back in
1968 and worked as a dealership mechanic until 1970.  John changed his
oil at the specified intervals,  adjusted his valves regularly, kept all
his flaps and thermostat in working order, never lugged or over revved
his engine, never drove his VW real hard but did everything strictly by
VW standards AND never got more than 65000 miles out of his engine
before having to tear it down and rebuild it.  The other brother, Jeff,
was also as far removed from normalcy as John,  just in the opposite
direction.  Jeff took care of things when the urge hit him.  Oil changes
- what oil changes?  Oh yeah, I am supposed to do that!  was his
attitude and he would change the oil the next time he thought of it.
Drove the VW hard!  The valves only got adjusted if John happened to be
visiting and had his tools with him.  At 95000 miles Jeff got
transferred from Wichita to Anchorage, AK, USA and he thought it might
be good to have the engine rebuilt before he left. (John thought it was
about time!).  The mechanics tore Jeff's engine apart, specked
everything for wear and called him up to ask him how long ago his last
rebuild had been. Jeff told them that he had never had a rebuild and
they were totally amazed.  It seemed the engine showed very little wear
and definitely not the wear one would expect from an engine that had
received so little maintenance.

Moral of the story - You make an educated guess at what you need to do
to keep your Bus running.  Yes CHT gauges help in ascertaining what is
going on inside your engine while you drive it, BUT even the best
maintenance and care may still not prevent an engine from needing to be
overhauled earlier than expected!  You may drive and abuse your bus
beyond belief,  not doing any maintenance and it may last indefinitely,
you are tempting fate!  Sometimes machines just break,  and sometimes
they don't.  One never really knows.  Be prepared to fix it if it needs
but hope that it doesn't.  If you have to make a guess,  guess on the
conservative side, just in case.  I'd rather rebuild an engine that
didn't need it than stare at a fist sized hole in my block and wonder
why I tried to urge it just 10,000 more miles.
John told me that he thought VW knew how unpredictable their engines
were.  He said that the reason that things were designed to be so
accessible and easy to remove was so that when a customer drove in with
an engine problem, you just pulled the engine, replaced it with one out
of the warehouse,  sent the customer on their way and then when you had
time, tore down the first engine, fixed what was wrong, shelved it in
the warehouse, waiting for the next customer to come in with engine
problems.

Sorry for the ramblings, but it finally is FRIDAY!!!
