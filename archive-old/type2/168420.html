Subject: Re: [T2] Resurrecting a 1972 Westy (From the viewpoint of a
  rookie)

Hi Chris,

Theres a product out there called Marvel Mystery Oil. Squirt some of that
into the spark plug holes. It works wonders on stuck engines.
Disconnect  the battery and try moving the engine in both directions in hope
to free it up. Its gotta be hella tight for the starter to stall. Is the
battery good?  It might also be beneficial to ensure that the wiring of the
hard start relay is correct.

I'd also recommend doing the normal tune up procedures, such as a net
distributor cap and ignition points if the engine has been sitting.

Let us know how it goes.
Eddie



I need recommendations on how to lessen the?mechanical resistance to
&gt; turning?over, keeping?in mind, everything is clean and clear, but it sat for
&gt; so long.
