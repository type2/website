sounds good to me- and while you are out,
drop by the tire dealer and find out which
tire is gonna go flat !

seriously, you can never plan enough, even
for a trip to the store (read Murphy's Law)
but i would have to say no one can predict
when the vw will break down. if they could,
we would prefer that it happen at home in the
driveway on a sunny afternoon a year from
next thursday...

in actual fact, there are impedence measurements
listed in the Bentley and Haynes manuals
which point to defective fuel injection
components, and could give some indication of
potential problems, and this would be an excellent
way to begin to familiarize yourself with them.
buy a meter and learn how to use it.  if you take
it to the dealer, plan on that as your future source
of assistance. hope they are open when you need them.

read your manual, do the proper maintenance,
activate those little antennas on the sides of your
head, pack some ignition parts, fan belt, spare
oil and filter, clutch and accelerator cables,
complete gasket set, tools jack /stands.
(and a whole lot of other fiddly stuff , too long
to list here ).

then go. have a good time.
