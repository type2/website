&gt;&gt; For those of residing in California, I am sending information for the
&gt;&gt; Califonia State web site where I found
&gt;&gt; email information to express displeasure over SB285 which now makes us
&gt;&gt; subject to losing our vehicles if they can't pass Smog Check II.
&gt;&gt; Recycling your auto is not an option.  It's paperweight time.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Let's flood the state offices with requests to appeal the bill .
&gt;
&gt;I have read the law and I cannot find anything as you describe.  A post
&gt;&gt;from the CARB states the same.
&gt;
&gt;I have found the following in this bill
&gt;
&gt;1. exemptions for vehicles made before 1974.
&gt;2. exemptions for 30 yr old vehicles after 2003
&gt;3. If the vehicle is detected as a gross polluter by a roadside station,
&gt;you are required to have the vehicle tested at a test only facility and if
&gt;found to be in violation, you have 30 days to fix it or the fine
&gt;(&quot;administrative fee&quot;) starts accumulating at $5/day with a max of $500.
&gt;In addition, they can refuse to reregister your car.
&gt;
&gt;I could find nothing about turning your car into a piece of scrap if it
&gt;fails testing as you imply.




Actually, all of us California Buspeople should *support* SB285 since it
addresses a number of areas that concern older VW owners.  Under current
law, 1973 and earlier vehicles are already exempt from testing (Oh joy!)
at smog test facilities.  What wasn't anticipated at the time of the
original bill was that there would be advances in *roadside* metering;
i.e, laser scanning of vehicles as they enter freeway and the like.  If
the current law remains unamended, those of us lucky to own a '71 Bus
(like myself) might be nailed as a &quot;gross polluter&quot; from an on-ramp tester
even though we haven't been required to get a smog check at a permanent
facility for years.  This is a very, very bad thing for reasons I don't
need to explain in a public newsgroup.  SB285 ends that loophole (&quot;hidden
trap&quot; is probably a better phrase) so the on-ramp testing won't apply to
us retrogrouches. (As a side issue, those with brand new cars who, like
1973 and earlier vehicles are exempted from station inspection, will still
be nailed by roadside equipment because SB285 doesn't address them.
However, two things mitigate my concern: one, it is unlikely that a
vehicle 4 years or younger is going to fail and two, I'll never own a new
car so screw these rich bastards anyway...)

Also, the original Smog Test II program was put into effect a while ago
(year and a half? two years ago?) and that's when the 1973 and earlier
exemption began.  However, they have not amended the law with an updated
cutoff.  Those who have 1974 vehicles who expected to be exempted this
year are SOL since the original 1973 date is still in the statute.  So
SB285 would make it a &quot;rolling&quot; exemption so that additional years are
added without the need to try and get a new amendment passed every
frigging year.  This is a Very, Very Good Thing.  What is a Very, Very Bad
Thing --and my biggest gripe with SB285-- is that the rolling exemption
won't start until 2003; in other words, the 1973 cutoff will remain in
effect for another 4 years or so.  In 2004, 1974 and earlier vehicles will
be exempted. in 2005, 1975, in 2006, 1976, and so on.  That means I have
to wait until 2008 before I can avoid screwing around with my '78 Fiat 124
for the biannual inspection.

Now, what I think Rosemary was justifiably concerned about, and perhaps
she first saw it in the language of SB285 and didn't realize that it was
already in effect, is that Health and Safety Code Sec. 44081 (b)(4)
currently provides that...


        (4) Procedures requiring owners of vehicles confirmed as gross
        polluters to have the vehicle repaired, resubmitted for testing,
        and obtain a certificate of compliance from a designated test-only
        facility or removed from service as attested by a certificate of
        nonoperation from the Department of Motor Vehicles within 30 days
        or be required to pay an administrative fee of not more than five
        hundred dollars ($500), to be collected by the Department of Motor
        Vehicles at the next annual registration renewal or the next
        change of ownership, whichever occurs first.  Commencing on the
        31st day after issuance of the notice of noncompliance, the fee
        shall accrue at the rate of five dollars ($5) per day up to the
        five hundred dollars ($500) maximum.  The registration of a
        vehicle shall not be issued or renewed if that vehicle has been
        identified as a gross polluter and has not been issued a
        certificate of compliance.  Except as provided in subdivision (b)
        of Section 9250.18 of the Vehicle Code, any revenues collected by
        the Department of Motor Vehicles pursuant to this subdivision and
        Section 9250.18 of the Vehicle Code shall be deposited in the
        Vehicle Inspection and Repair Fund.  If the ownership of the
        vehicle is transferred, the administrative fee provided for in
        this subdivision shall be waived if the vehicle is brought into
        compliance.


This means that if you are nailed as a gross polluter, you've got to go to
the more expensive &quot;test only&quot; stations and pass or you can't register
your car for use on the open highway (so forget trying to drive around
looking for parts).  The language of the law is a bit unclear as to
whether you can get a certificate of non-operation (meaning that you would
stick it into your driveway) but I was told at the DMV by a counter
staffperson, perhaps incorrectly, that once the registration expired and
thereafter the vehicle was tabbed as a GP, you can't get a non-op cert
(which means you'd have to junk it).  If you screw around until the tags
have expired and then go running around to get a smog check, you may be
asking for trouble.  Interestingly, you can pay your registration fees
prior to expiration even without a smog permit; you won't get the tags but
at least you'll avoid the penalties you'd rack up if it took a couple of
months to find that stock oil cooler.

Lucky for us, single carb 1600 VW engines are pretty easy things to get
into spec.  But those with more touchy setups are in for a real treat come
next smog inspection time.  If you haven't done it for a while and expect
that your $400 J.C.  Whitney CO meter will be of help, fergeddaboudit.
The new California system mandates that all testing be done on a dyno;
they essentially *drive* your vehicle at 15 and 25MPH.  You don't have one
of these so you'll be operating in the blind.

No problem you say?  Just go to a &quot;Pass or Don't Pay&quot; station, get the
readout for free, then go home and tinker?  No way my friend.  P or DP
stations have gone the way of eight tracks.  You won't find one anymore
unless your cousin owns the local gas station.  Even &quot;Pass or Free Retest&quot;
stations are not the norm though you shouldn't have too much trouble if
you shop around.

No problem there? &quot;Pass or Free Retest&quot; just means that you have two
chances to pass for one price?  Maybe and maybe not.  If you do more than
just fail, if you enter into Gross Polluter territory, your friendly local
tester will keep your money and print out a cute little DMV certificate
that informs you that the rules have changed horribly.  You now have to go
to one of a handful of &quot;Test Only&quot; stations since your vehicle won't get
registered without special documentation.  If you can't do that without
dropping a ton of dough, get the smelter ready.

How bad can that be?  Well, &quot;Test Only&quot; stations do only one thing: they
test.  That means all their income has to be from testing.  No running a
testing program at a discount to attract business; they can't even be
related to someone who owns a gas station nearby.  There are only a few
Test Only stations so they essentially charge whatever they want without
the fear of competition.  Worst of all, they won't lift a finger to help
you.  I recently failed a Test Only inspection for one reason only: my
idle RPM was 50rpm too high. 50!  Everything else passed perfectly.  Test
Only stations don't have a screwdriver to adjust nuthin' and they would be
fined if they did anything but ram a tester up your tail pipe.

Nah, you say, this won't apply to me; I'll never have to hit an expensive
Test Only station.  Not true.  Even if you've never been tagged as a Gross
Polluter, even if you've never failed a smog test since it rolled off the
line in Wolfsburg, you *will* be required to use one of the few test only
stations.  You see, they've included vehicles who fit a &quot;high-emitter
profile&quot; on the list that has to visit a test only facility.  As it was
explained to me by a test only station owner with a gleam in his eye, if
your car was made in one of two places before the early eighties, you fit
the profile.  Unfortunately, the two places are anywhere east of New York
City and anywhere west of San Francisco.  Got it?  That's you.  If it
ain't, you're in the wrong newsgroup.

So here are a couple of tricks I learned while trying to get my Fiat
passed last month.  I did most except #9 which I don't recommend.

1) Pay the registration fees early even if you don't have the smog cert
yet.

2) Shop around for smog test prices.  They vary dramatically from place to
place.  Ask...

    a) Are you a Pass or Don't Pay? (not likely...)
    b) Are you a Pass or Free Retest? (if not, don't go)
    c) ,,,If so, how many days do I have to get it retested?
    d) Do you do &quot;pretesting&quot;? (if not, don't go)
    e) How much for the pretesting?
    f) How much for the actual inspection?
    h) How much for the certificate?


3) Get a &quot;pre-test&quot; first.  A few --very few-- places will offer to test
your car OFF THE MODEM for anywhere from $20 to $40 dollars (some get cute
and quote you the same price as a full inspection).  This is critical
since if they do a full test online, Sacramento will know about it if you
exceed gross polluter levels.  That $30 will be the wisest investment
you've ever made.  DON'T GET AN INSPECTION WITHOUT A PRETEST!

4) Don't feel obligated to do it all at one place.  If one spot gives
pretests for $20 but charges $60 for the inspection and cert and another's
prices are $30 and $50, do one at one place and another at another,

5) Lean out (crank down) your idle mix to near stalling.  You may think
that the 15 and 25MPH testing makes idle mix irrelevant but I can tell you
that it matters.  Why it does I'll leave to the tech heads among you.  Use
your idle speed adjustment screw to keep it running.

6) Spec your settings.  They are a lot more touchy about dwell, timing,
and idle speed.  You don't have any leeway but the more you can retard the
timing, the better.

7) If you've been getting away with non stock equipment because the moron
at the gas station doesn't know squat, those days are over.  Test Only
folks know every car ever made, especially older foreign vehicles.

8) Be real friendly with the tester.  If you fail for something stupid
like high idle or a hose that has fallen off, a happy tester *might* point
it out to you early and let you fix it on the fly.  Even if they don't,
they may let you back into the front of the line for testing after you've
fiddled with it in the parking lot (a major time saver).

8) A trick someone told me was to &quot;reverse&quot; your catalytic converter so
that the less-used side would get the exhaust first.  Couldn't hurt I
suppose and I can't see how that would be illegal.

9) If all else fails and you've been tested at Gross Polluter levels (ON
YOUR PRETEST, REMEMBER?), there is an answer though I would never do this
myself since my vehicles always are right on the money and I don't believe
in circumventing rules that are put there for our benefit.  However, it
has been shown that running ethanol (essentially grain alcohol
-&quot;everclear&quot;- with a touch of methanol so you don't mix it with orange
juice for a powerful cocktail) will **dramatically** reduce emissions from
gross polluter levels to well within specs.  You can buy ethanol at
larger hardware stores (a gallon is about $12) where it is often labeled
as &quot;marine stove fuel&quot; or &quot;shellac thinner&quot;.  Make sure you are getting
ethanol and not something else.  Now, cars have been running on
gasoline-alcohol mixes for years and &quot;gasohol&quot; is commonly sold all over
the midwest and northwest.  But that's a 10% mix of ethanol.  To get the
smog benefits, you may have to run it at 20% to 30% (20% is about 3/4
gallon of ethanol to 3 gallons of gas).  I've known lawbreakers to even go
higher.  You would want to do this on a nearly empty tank since you need
to drive it all out as soon as possible: ethanol is not good for some
rubber seals (so I've been told) though the 10% mix doesn't seem to harm
anybody in Iowa or Oregon.  Again, this is probably not legal and is
certainly immoral.



Hope this helps,


Nick
