Subject: Re: [T2] Amp meter needed

&gt;I need something to measure current draw in my VW, to track down where my 
&gt;battery power is going.
&gt;
&gt;  Like an amp meter?!?!
&gt;
&gt;The multimeter (with micro amp meter) I have has a .5 amp fuse.  I know, I 
&gt;just blew it last night, so I need something stronger.
&gt;
&gt;Hopefully something in Radio Shack that I can cludge together.
