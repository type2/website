Subject: Re: [T2] Hydro Seal

Yea------

And read that bottle of oil the next time you change it---

That'll cause skin cancer through  repeated contact.

Almost every product in the auto parts store has that warning on it.
There's even a warning before you enter the store. 
At the VW dealer I've had to sign a waiver to the same effect for
anything I buy (such as a new bolt or washer).
