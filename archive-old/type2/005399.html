Yes, add me to the list of being satisfied with Ron's products and service. 
BTW, as the owner/rebuilder of a couple of other old, and even orphaned
cars, I can assure you even at his worst, Ron is miles ahead of other re-
sellers of auto parts...Especially in price, and almost always in service...

I'm fortunate in that my local flaps carries a very large inventory of VW
parts in stock.  They sell these items over the counter at prices generally
lower than even the &quot;discount&quot; mail order places.  What they don't carry is
bus rubber or sheet metal.  I've bought these items (body  panels/rubber)
from BusDepot and the shipping took a long time (several days longer than
promised when I placed the order on my dime).  The rubber parts had no part
#s or any other identification on them.  I have no idea where they were
made, but they were not the same quality of the original parts.  They did
&quot;fit&quot; and they do &quot;work&quot;.  The sheet metal parts were of good quality and
the fit was fine.

Would I do business with Ron again?  Yes and here's why.  I believe Ron is a
good guy and is honestly trying to provide what he says.  He appears to be
trying to rectify some of the difficulties customers are experiencing.  He
is correct in saying that the extra attention, fast shipping, large
inventories etc. cost money which we the consumer must pay for.  I've owned
and operated a business for over 20yrs and I get the same responses from
time to time from a customer who thought they should have gotten the
Cadillac treatment while buying their Kia. (only a metaphor)

&gt; &gt; Then I just happened to place another order in the interim an after I
&gt; &gt; got done placing the order, I inquired about the prior one.
&gt; &gt; &quot;Sorry I can't answer that question on this line&quot;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What the hell----I'm here, now, and I'm the one being inconvenienced,
&gt; &gt; just answer my question--- where's my stuff?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I feel like this is such a simple concept.  Why is it so difficult to get
&gt; across?
&gt;
&gt; A year ago we didn't have a toll-free number, period. You had to order the
&gt; parts on your dime.  Now if you have part numbers you can order on my
dime.
&gt; But all other questions still require calling the original toll number.
&gt; This is not an &quot;inconvenience&quot; compared to last year - it is an
improvement,
&gt; another choice that you can make.  Just like my shipping policy.  Want the
&gt; rock-bottom price?  No problem, standard delivery, 7-10 working days. Want
&gt; faster service?  No problem, pay a little more and it's expedited. But
don't
&gt; choose the rock-bottom option and then complain because it wasn't
expedited.
&gt; And don't avail yourself of the toll-free &quot;orders only&quot; option, and then
be
&gt; upset that the person who answered the phone could do nothing but take
&gt; orders.
&gt;
&gt; If you would like every incoming line at The Bus Depot to be toll free,
&gt; including customer service, I can do that.  It will significantly add to
the
&gt; cost of the parts that you buy.  If you would like every order to arrive
&gt; within a couple of days of when you order, rather than just expedited
ones,
&gt; I can do that too.  It will significantly add to the cost of the parts
that
&gt; you buy.   If you would like trained Volkswagen technicians to answer the
&gt; customer service line, I can even do that. It too will significantly add
to
&gt; the cost of the parts that you buy.   I can offer an unconditional
warranty
&gt; on everything I sell. I can have out-of-stock items hand delivered from
&gt; Germany by courier to avoid backordering a product.  I can personally fly
to
&gt; your house and install the part for you. I can offer any service that you
&gt; can possibly think of.  But not for these prices.
&gt;
&gt; I think that many people who complain simply do not understand the
dynamics
&gt; of running a business.  My prices are lower than anyone else's, apples for
&gt; apples, practically accross the board.  In cases where my price is not
&gt; lower, you can almost be positive that it's because my quality is higher.
&gt; You can pay for your toll call to customer service, AND for express
&gt; shipping, and as a whole STILL save money compared to buying anywhere
else.
&gt; If I started doing all of the things some would like me to do, my prices
&gt; wouldn't be so low anymore.
&gt;
&gt; It's like saying &quot;Well, I shopped at Walmart because I liked their prices.
&gt; But I couldn't find an experienced salesperson anywhere in the store.  The
&gt; stock clerk couldn't answer my questions about the product. I had to buy
&gt; from a picture on the box rather than having a working demo in front of
me.
&gt; When they were out of stock on an item I wanted, they refused to overnight
&gt; it to me at their expense when it came back in.  And then I had to -gasp-
&gt; stand in line for ten minutes at the register!!&quot;   What's wrong with this
&gt; picture?  If you shop Walmart expecting Walmart, you won't be
disappointed,
&gt; and you will get some good bargains as well.  But if you shop Walmart
&gt; expecting Bloomingdales, you will indeed be disappointed, and no amount of
&gt; complaining that you can possibly do will turn Walmart into Bloomingdales.
&gt;
&gt; I am very upfront about what I do and do not offer.  It's your money and
&gt; your choice.  If you want the best possible parts at the best possible
&gt; prices - and this I work very, very hard to offer - then I can do that.
If
&gt; your taste leans more toward higher-priced, full service retailers, then
&gt; please, by all means, patronize your local VW dealer or import auto part
&gt; store. That's what he's there for.
