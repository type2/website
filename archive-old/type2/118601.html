Subject: Re: [T2] Mysterious Vacuum Gauge Readings

Steve,
Well, not idea either on the vacuum fluctuations. I've never experienced
anything like what you describe.
It sounds like you are getting an excessively high reading also? My guess is
could it be the choke getting stuck, or moving about when running? I have seen
plenty of stuck chokes in my time.
For the advance, David has it right on the advance tapping position.
As all the carbies and advance units I have seen are single/advance only units
I can't help on the retard side.
Richard,
Dual carbs and loving it :-)
