&gt; Hi Volks
&gt; just wanted to add my .02. There is a product I used to sell in the
watercraft
&gt; biz called fyrebuoy which is an automatic halon extinguisher. It is
mounted in
&gt; the engine compartment and if a fire starts, sensor melts, halon
goes off and
&gt; light on dash goes on.

This is a good product, but most VW fuel system fires start outside of
the engine bay.  The rubber fuel hoses ahead of the engine bay tend to
be neglected and also pass fairly close to the #3 exhaust pipe, where
the heat bakes the hose and will ignite the fuel that leaks from the
cracks.  There is also the possibility of leaks in the metal fuel line
as it passes through the tin, due to failure of the grommet.  Again,
the engine bay halon system won't touch this fire because it isn't in
the engine bay.

Rather than installing an expensive extinguishing system, it's better
just to make sure that the lines are fresh and that the metal line is
properly supported and grommeted.
