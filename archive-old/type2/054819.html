Subject: high top conversions

I have seen a Westie that originally had a center of the bus slide back
sunroof thing, but it was converted later to a pop top.  The sliding roof
thing was removed and a pop top added by some self-styled Macgyver with no
pride in his/her work.  It looked awful, had gaping holes, etc.  It's in a
wrecking yard here in Seattle.

&quot;...and I'd have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for those pesky kids
and their dog!&quot; 

&gt; Rumour has it that factory highroof Westies could be
&gt; ordered too (as could hardtop or sunroof Westies), but I've never
&gt; come across one of those.
