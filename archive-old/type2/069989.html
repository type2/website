    ---------------
Truck is overall cood condition.  Cab: Nose has never been hit; floor
needs minor work but door jams ae clean. Top Bed: The bed itself is in
really good condition; the side gates have had weld work on the hinges but
they work very well. Bottom Bed: Bed needs works but the frame rails are
all in tack; two out riggers need to be replaced but all else is fine; the
cargo door works and only needs the handle. Engine compartment is clean
but I don't have the correct 36hp motor. Transmission: Just recently
replaced with an original 1958 transmisson.  Willing to trade for a Single
or Double dooor Panel.  I'm new to this WWW stuff so its best to call 516
669 2889 for additional details.
