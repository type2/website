Subject: Re: [T2] I'm hitting the garage door!

&gt; So before I totally screw this up, I need pointers on how to do 
&gt; this.  I am planning on installing new shocks, can they be adjusted 
&gt; to lower it alone?
&gt;

    No. If it's &quot;just&quot; an inch to get into the garage, why not just de-
flate the tires...?
    If you're gonna be going in an' out of the garage regularly, you've
probably gotta raise the door header.
