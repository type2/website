Actually the government was the one that made the units not accurate, but
last year they turned off the scrambling devices so now they are as accurate
as the military ones. (Thats why they hit the Chinese embasy :}  .  )

Just found something really cool for a palm pilot

This is a must have, I still have to talk my wife into yet another toy, but
I think this one is great, I already have the PalmIII so for $47 what can I
loose?

&gt; GPS have a random error built in ..at least civilian units. THis should
&gt; explain the inaccuracies you guys have observed, apparently the
&gt; government doesn't like people to know where they are :-)  ... actually
&gt; its an anti terrorism/espionage thing.  More expensive units can only be
&gt; more accurate up until a certain point so the cheap ones may serve your
&gt; purpose adequately, or the ones that piggy back on palm devices (cool
&gt; gizmos those are) Personally i like the low tech aspect of my bus love
&gt; those analog gauges , spending hours everyday pouring over spatial
&gt; models makes me appreciate not having yet another digital map in front
&gt; of me. but you can't beat them when you are lost!
