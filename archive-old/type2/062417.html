Subject: Gas cap dilimma..

Ok, all you owners of 66-71&lt;or 72&gt; busses, help me out here.

Who do you get your gas caps from, and, are they any good? I got the bus, 
and a few days later the cap was leaking. Fine i say, i'll get another. 
Of course, the only one available in this town is from NOPI.As we know, 
its not exatly a standard cap. So, i get a new one. 9.95 my cost..

No problem. 2 weeks later, its dumping gas out just like the old. A bit 
pieved, i head back, and they order me a new one &lt;had gotten the last in 
stock&gt;. Next day, i get it, and no problem, until les  than 23 hours 
later, gas sloshes everywhere! So i head back, and buy this time, me and 
the bguy at NOPI &lt;great, helpful people, at least the ones here in 
Augusta&gt; are getting agitated. He wets another off the shelf, and THIS 
one didnt even make it on the car!! He pulled it out of the box, and the 
gasket was already disintigrated! well, i took it anyway, cause it does 
at least keepsomething in..they guy at NOPI expects bme back tuesday wehn 
they open..:)


So, seeing as how i still have the first one, i think i'll just get my 
money back. Now, where do i get a reliable one? &lt;Jim_at_Busboys?&gt; an, when i 
find one, i want to know who manufactures it, so i can tell my firends at 
NOPI...oh, and this same gas cap also fits someyearmodel of Safari's...





Anyhow....ideas would be greatly appreciated...in the meantime, i search 
the town for a silicone seal that is rated for constant emulsion in gas...





thanks....
....david
