Subject: Cracked case

Listees,
    I just got the word on why my engine was leaking oil. Cracked case under
the doghouse right by the cooler. (Doktor Tim was right) Now I am in the
market for a motor for my '70 bus. For now, I will be investing in a steady
supply of oil until I can get the new motor.
    The question then is what size motor will be best. What will give me the
best power and performance without sacrificing gas mileage. I currently am
running a 1600dp that I had in my beetle. I use Ma Cherie' for work and put
on about 3,000 miles a month.
    Also, if anyone has a used motor for sale in the Wilmington, NC area or
within 4 hours ride, I'd be interested.
Later,
Jim
Hampstead, NC
