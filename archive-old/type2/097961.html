&gt; some equivalent size flat and lock washers?

I've been able to find wavy washers at Home Despot, but they tend to
change their stock quite often so who knows if they stock them now.  Other
possible sources are german car places, BMW motorcycle shops, etc.

Whenever I make a U-pick wrecking yard run, I tend to throw any hardware
close at hand into my bucket.  Wavy washers and flanged nuts are worth
stooping to pick up!  :)
