Subject: the vent wing latch loosen trick

volkuns - i've seen this before on the list but i'm doing wrong keywords in
the beloved archive. what is the trick to loosening the stuck vent latch
without discombobulation of the black plastic round? i thought a weekend of
liquid and liquid wrench would do it.   THANKYOU  - steve
