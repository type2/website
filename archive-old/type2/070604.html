Subject: Re: [T2] 71 disc brakes in a 68

&gt;If 71 and 68 front beams are interchangeable, I'd take the easy way out and
&gt;just swap the whole beam with everything on it.

It's my understanding that the mounting bolt pattern on the '68-'69 
beam is different than the later busses...with even some '69's being 
different. The '68 beam is the same mounting bolt pattern as a '67 
and down split window bus. Best to swap the spindles and discs. 
BUT...if your really gonna go through the trouble, I'd just try and 
hunt down some of the later disc brakes as they are bigger and parts 
are cheaper. I do understand the reasoning on &quot;i've already got it, 
so why not&quot; and do that myself on many things. Just wanted to make 
the suggestion though.
