First - My wife and son and I went up to Napa valley and camped in a
beautiful spot and had lots of fun. Only an hour or so away from home - a
good way to see how all worked out.

Second - the futon on the fold down seat (Bessy is a conversion) is too old
and worn out for two over fourty adults. My son Alex had a blast in the
upper bunk.

Third - I recently had the bus set to tune up specs by a local shop. The
mechanic there told me I had the flap for the fan to oil cooler closed all
the way. Ok people can yell at me now for not hooking up the thermostat. So
per the mechanics instructions I opened it up a bit. The bus ran hotter than
ever - on the zero of the 240 cruising at 60 mph and between that and the 2
on the 260 when siting in Napa valley traffic. After arriving at the camp
ground and deciding to go on another short ride I disconnected the rig for
the fan flap and drove it that way. This resulted in just above the 240 mark
for flat driving and all the way up to 260 going up and over a mountain pass
that took mostly third but some second gear. Home today was at 240 on the
line going 55-60 with a strong head wind.

What is normal temp. for this type IV 79 2.0 liter?????

Fourth - on the way home the needle on my tach started to go up and down
(repeatedly back and forth) about 500 only when accelerating, at idle it
held steady - checked the connection at the coil all seems fine. Any ideas??

Thanks in advance! Maybe I will see some of you at Kelly park. I'll be the
guy with curly black and gray hair wearing a VW shirt ;-)
