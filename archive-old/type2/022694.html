A while back I was going to replace the pop top on my 72 westy with a
sunroof but then I figured I'd leave it original so I have a complete
sunroof assembly I'd sell for $150.  It comes with the tracks, cables, inner
and outter panels, the hand crank, and screws... everything needed to
install a sunroof (except a bus with a sunroof frame).  I'm in North San
Diego County and I'd be willing to deliver as far as Los Angeles or Tijuana.
