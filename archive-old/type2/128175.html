Hello all, I am posting this for a friend of mine.
Anyways she has a Riviera style pop-top(goes straight
up) that she wants to sell off her bus. She is going
with a high roof, so she don't need it. It is located
in Pocatello, Idaho. 

It was all restored about a year ago, primed,
painted, new custom made white polyester double coated
tent, and new weather stripping. It is all ready to
put on. She is asking $600. if anyone is interested
let me know, I can get some digital pics if wanted.
She doesn't have a phone or e-mail, so I can help in
any way needed.

Thanks, Shawn R
