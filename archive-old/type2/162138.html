Subject: ignition to coil black wire

Hi list,



Thank you all for your help. I have decided to replace the black wire
that goes from the coil to the fuse box. I have gotten the wire to the
fuse box but I am confused as to where to connect it. The wiring
diagrams http://vintagebus_dot_com/wiring/bus-70-71.jpg seem to indicate the
bottom of the fuse box but I just have a big metal box attached there.
So, where does the wire connect on the fuse terminal if I can't put it
at the bottom of fuse 10?



Thanks,


Max
