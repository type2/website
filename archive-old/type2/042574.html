Subject: 70 vs. 72

Hello All,
Thanks to all for your responses to my question about putting a 1835cc
engine into a 70.  I'm pretty convinced that my best choice is to locate
a 1600cc Engine.  During my search I located a 72 westy in very good
shape.  Once again there is no engine.  Today I found a 1600cc engine
with a Weber carb and the fixings from a local shop.  My question:  What
are the major differences between a 70 and 72.  Both are westies and
bodies seem to be in good shape, however I still need to see them for
myself. Other than the rear suspension differences are there any
advantages to owning a 72?  

Jason
