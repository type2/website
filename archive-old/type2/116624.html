Hey, you turned out ok with your barbies. ;)
I intentionally take each barbie and give them a defect.

ie, barbie with a mustache, barbie missing a limb.  Barbie with a
bad hair day, barbie with bad taste in clothing. Butch Barbie.

The kids will be just fine.

&gt;Even the inclusion of multi-cultural transportation that a type 2 van
&gt;represents cannot compensate for the future and perhaps, irreparable
&gt;harm to a young child's sense of body image, that a Barbie doll fosters
&gt;............ ;-)
