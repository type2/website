Subject: Re: [T2] FI fuel pump failing?

Thanks for the e-mails

I'm sorry the wording was not very clean on some points, let me 
clarify.  I changed the fuel filter today with a fresh one, same 
erratic readings from the gauge. I was hoping it was a clogged 
fuel filter but changing it didn't make a change.  I held the used 
filter next to a bright light and I see NO visible rust in the 
filter material.

Also I have tested the fuel pump with the engine off by deflected the 
AFM flap with the ignition ON and the pump doesn't make strange noises 
as frequently?!? 

In the past when I had a carburetor fuel pump on the bus for my Weber 
carb, I had no problems with clogged filters, although after 10k 
miles the filter did contain some rust. This probably doesn't mean much 
though since the carb pump doesn't move as much fuel though the filter
as a FI pump.

I did think it was the pressure regulator but when I swapped in the
old one, the fuel pressure still jumped around. The reason I replaced 
the old regulator was because it was giving me a reading of 31 psi at
idle instead of the 28psi.  Both regulators gave steady readings prior
to this week. 

I recall reading some place that the fuel pressure should never drop
below 28psi. Is that correct?

Tomorrow I'll check the fuel quantity delivered by the pump and
make sure that the tank outlet line is also not partially clogged.

Any more thoughts?

Alex
