Subject: Re: [T2] FW: Spill-proof cans -- suck!

Reminds me of something that happened around 30 years ago in the name of 
&quot;consumer safety&quot;. Some politician passed a law that motorcyclists had to 
wear seat belts. Looks good on paper! It was quickly repealed.

I would love to see someone show up with a lawnmower and one of those gas 
cans, and have one of the beaurocrats fill the lawn mower up in front of 
everyone to prove your point.
