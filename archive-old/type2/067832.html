 F.Y.I. - 1600 dual port rebuilt

Was in my local Kragen Auto Parts chain store this am and saw they were
selling 1600 cc dual port long block engines for $622 plus about a $200 core
charge.  Have no idea how good these are or who does them or any thing else,
but figgured it might be a useful data point for some of you folk.

Harvey
