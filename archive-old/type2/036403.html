Pour money on it Idea:
If it were mine, I'd consider replacing the fuel pump *and* the fuel lines.
Also check the condition of the wire that leads to the fuel pump.

Diagnostic suggestion:
Run a small wire lead from the fuel pump circuit back up to the dashboard
and power a small light-bulb with it. If the problem is with the electricity
not getting to the pump, you'll see that light flickering at the same time
as you lose power.


And BUY A FIRE EXTINGUSHER!!!

Happy trails,

&gt; Subject: Really bad engine probs
&gt; 
&gt; I've got a quick question about my engine which has some major problems.
&gt; Sometimes when I'm driving I find that the engine will not engage - it's
&gt; jolts back and forth as though going through a bad gear change but isn't.
&gt; The fuel pumps seems to be leaking as there's gas all around it and the fuel
&gt; gauge on the dash jumps all over the place once under 3/4 of a tank.
&gt; 
&gt; It's an upright stock 1600 with Solexpict30 carb and stock fuel pumps. Are
&gt; these problems related? Are they major? Doe's any one have any thought or
&gt; all? It would be greatly appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Frustrated owner,
&gt; 
&gt; Rob
