Subject: RE: [T2] plugged fuel line/tank(beetle)


I just went through this will my '69 that was last driven in 88.
Compressed air should blow out the fuel line, although I doubt a pump
like you mention would work.  Also, you'll need to take the carb off and
take it apart, cleaning out the jets and the gunk that's built up in the
float chamber.

&gt; I just purchased a 1971 Super Beetle from the original owner for $50
&gt; Canadian. One wheel is seized and they did not run the car=20
&gt; since 1986. Well
&gt; I put in a battery and the engine turned over. I checked that=20
&gt; there was
&gt; spark. Poured some gas into the carb and vhhhhmmmmm! fired=20
&gt; right up then
&gt; died. I tried disconnecting the fuel line going to the tank,=20
&gt; which I had
&gt; added new gas to, and sucked as hard as I could. Nothing. I attached a
&gt; bicycle pump to the fuel line to try and blow the blockage=20
&gt; out of the line.
&gt; I can get it up to 60pounds of pressure with no fuel flowing.=20
&gt; Does any one
&gt; know what my next step should be. Should I pull the gas tank=20
&gt; and try to
&gt; clean it? Any other suggestions would be awesome. Is there a=20
&gt; way to clear
&gt; the blockage with everything still on the car. My mechanic skills are
&gt; limited.
&gt; thanks in advance,
&gt; Glenn
