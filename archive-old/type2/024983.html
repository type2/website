re attaching a trailer hitch.


I would not relay on the bumper brackets alone to pull stuff.

I have a hitch I'll put on my 61 at some point- it does have a cross piece 
that attaches to the bumper brackets but the main pull comes from the frame 
of the bus forward of the tranny.   

In case you are wondering, yes it is possible to tow w/ a splitty.  Used to 
have a hitch on it (my ex bfs) that attached to the rear torsion tube with a 
holder bracket on the rear bumper in the middle.   Towed various bus here and 
there w/it, and towed an oval window bug back from Idaho  500 miles and over 
the cascades.      

Then again if anyone does want to tow w/ the bumper, I ave a rear bumper w/ 
reinforced brackets and tow ball attached I'd part with for $35 in Oly WA.   
Could be prettier.  Weighs a ton, not shippable.
