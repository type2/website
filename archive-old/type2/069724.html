Subject: Re: Rebuilt Spindles 64-67

Roy -

The biggest difference in our spindles verses some others (Wolfgang's not the
only one) is that we tend to be a little more picky on the condition of King
Pins (the core pieces) on the spindles....  We tend to pay a little more for
good core units than the competition which in alot of cases will buy anything
they get their hands on.  Out of 5 spindle pair cores I receive or buy, I
eventually have to scrap the pins on 3 out of the 5 because they are so
pitted and mistreated from previous owner's lack of maintenance - they should
be lubed every 1500 miles.  I learned the hard way with my 67 Deluxe from the
day it was new - it was drilled into my head by my late father and after
307,000 miles I've never had to rebuild them - they're in that good of shape.

Rebuilding the best (and only the best) core units involves a little more
work than some of the others and the methods employed.  The King pin has a
Rockwell Hardness factor which is only so thick to regrind, resurface and
polish to maintain the integrity of the King Pin Strength.  When I first came
to BBI years ago, I noticed at least 26 grind sizes on the chart they use in
the shop.  I'd say grind size #14 thru #26 was bit uncomfortable for me and
felt it compromised on King Pin Quality and Integrity.  The method BBI was
using at the time to resurface the Pin was a Grinding Wheel mounted on a
Lathe - not the most desirable method because a Lathe doesn't track as true.
 Went out and purchased a used Landis OD Grinder ($3500us) and very good
condition.  These are the right machines to use when grinding Pins,
Crankshafts (we don't do these yet) and other items requiring a very strict
tolerance which was felt was needed to produce as superior a product as
possible.  In addition, the bronze bushing stock was rather soft and of poor
quality, subject to what I felt was premature wear than the original bushing
stock.  Changed that to Silicone-Bronze Bushings - much better.  Another
thing was they were using Adjustable Reamers because of the various finished
Pin sizes.  Tossed those in favor of Custom-made Reamer Tools for EACH size
of Pin (Not cheap - about $125 each for those).  Procedureal changes were
also made to insure that the spindle assembly could be as close as possible
to what the factory specified in their Workshop Manual (now in the 63-67
Bentley).  All of this costs a little more money to do (I'll be up front - at
the last review of the Bill of Materials and Labor sheet on this product it
was about $179us OUR COST to produce a set of spindles) and we feel it's
worth it.  (Incidently, the guy working there at the time is now doing them
at WG across town, didn't really care for the way I like doing things, came
to work when he wanted, so product availability and quality suffered even
more than when I was there for the first two months.  He knows how to do them
right, but at last report, he was doing them the old-fashioned BBI way before
I came to BBI, but I also heard that they may have gotten an OD Grinder like
ours, so maybe their Pins are being done almost as nice as ours).  In my
opinion, you get what you pay for.  BTW their Link Pin Set Price shown is for
Reconditioned ($50us).  They have new Link Pin Sets at about $90us as
reported by another customer recently.

Bill forgot to mention that over the border sales require your cores to be
shipped to us in advance - 2 reasons 1)Most foreign spindle sales usually
never result in cores being returned (There's a fierce core shortage on 64-67
spindle sets here in the US) and 2) If they check out OK, it is less to pay
(VAT) overall for the units (Still $249us but no core charges to worry about
unless a pin or two is too far gone to regrind/resurface - about $20us per
pin).  The other guys apparently don't worry about this stuff, but then again
I guess they'll take anything they can get IMHO.  Where does that $20 per pin
go?  Part of it goes into the core bank account to help buy more good cores.
 But the majority of it goes into another account to eventually reproduce the
pins - yep we're gonna do that this next year - brand new ones. :-)
