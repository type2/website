Subject: Hub Cap, It Done Rolt Along [thread expires 9/10/00]


Okay. Regarding the Great Bus Tour which is actually a Great Hubcap Tour,
but who's counting:

Chris Huff has bowed out as Official Hub Cap Cruise Director after a long
and distinguished tenure. I want to thank her loud and long on behalf of
all the volks for helping to move the Hub Cap down the road for so long.

&lt;applause&gt; &lt;applause&gt;

Chris has said she will still maintain the Bus Tour's web page if that is
desired, but it either needs a new Czar, or it needs an unprecedented
degree of uncoordinated cooperation, from this point forward. Perhaps with
the indulgence of the administrators we can discuss this on the lists OVER
THE WEEKEND and not beyond.

As long as nothing changes on the web side I have no intelligent opinions
about this and certainly no authority over how it proceeds, you folks have
to take it from here; we (and procmail) have every confidence that you can
do that while preserving a flame-free environment.

Thanks!
