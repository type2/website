Kenny --  Reading your latest post in the Digest.  Can't say what the little
triangle might be without seeing a picture or getting a better description.
Also can't tell whether you are talking about the input shaft to the trans
as &quot;transmission pin( the little thing that the engine sits on..&quot;   You can
get a lot better information from guys on the list if you would first sit
down with any of the better workshop manuals and learn the language -- just
a polite suggestion.  Maybe you could find a Peasantsvagen friend near
Lethbridge who would be willing to give you some help.  Good luck!

Subject: Bug engine in Westy


|There are design differences in engines intended for transporters,
something
|about oil clearances in the conrods, etc....... but if it's any comfort to
|you, I transplanted several bug engines into 63-67 microbuses with very
|satisfactory results.  I just drove like the proverbial little old lady to
|avoid stressing the engine..... got many useful miles out of those
|microbuses.  Will be interested to read how it turns out for you.  Good
|luck!
