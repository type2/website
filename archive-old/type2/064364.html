&gt;I
&gt;have the Michelin XZX 185SR14 reinforced but I can't seem to find them.  The
&gt;tire place I go to said that he didn't think they were made anymore but still
&gt;has one in stock ( I need two as they had 30K miles on them, the front are
&gt;Sumitomos w/ 15K on them).   I'd like to stick w/ Michelin but is there
&gt;another
&gt;'part' they make for vanagons?

You're right.  They don't make the Michelin XZX any more.

My tire guy says the replacement is Michelin LTX 195/75-R14.  It's a little
wider and has an all-season tread.  I got a set of these last month and I
really love them.  They're wonderfully quiet, really improve the handling
of the van, and costed a small bundle.  But heck, tires are critical.

If, on the other hand, you just need one tire bedcause of the blowout I
don't think it would be wise to mix these LTX tires with your old XZX ones.
