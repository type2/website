Bryan,

This may just be compression, but there is an easy way to check...
Remove the following, one at a time, in the order stated, try turning the
engine between removals:

remove:          If it gets easy to turn, it's:
spark plugs      just compression, you are fine
fan belt         bad gen/alt bearings
distributor      bad distributor
rockers          stuck valve.

If, after you have removed all these things, it is still sticky then you
have a problem in the bottom end.  It is time to pull that engine and have
a look inside the case.  If it's sticky valves, it is still time to pull
the engine and i would seriously advise a rebuild, but that's a case of
&quot;do as I say,&quot; as I have gotten many miles out of engines with
compressions that low (forced by poverty years ago :-( With 95
compressions, you are due for a rebuild pretty soon anyway, sorry to say.
