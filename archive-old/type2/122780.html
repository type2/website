Subject: Re: [T2] type IV fan fell off

Hi Jason,

That 3-bolt flange that the fan bolts up to is tapered to fit onto the 
crank and is held to the crank with one bolt. If that bolt breaks or 
comes unthreaded, the fan comes off. Even if the noise isn't obvious, 
you will know pretty quick anyway as the alternator light will come on 
as soon as the pulley stops turning.

Have a look at this diagram:
http://homepage.mac_dot_com/ratwell/Microfiche/t200900.gif

The flange is part number 6, and the bolt that holds it to the crank is 
part number 24.

In 2001 the bolt that helds my bus's fan broke off, and the engine had 
to be dropped in order to drill out the remains and replace it. It also 
chewed up the key slot pretty good. When I reassembled it I used lots 
of red loctite on the flange/crank junction and on the bolt as well. 
The bolt is supposed to be a one-time use item, and it's still 
available from VW dealers.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt;
&gt; This problem you speak of -- is it particular to older T4 engines?  
&gt; The fan on my '78 engine is held on by 3 bolts with 1/2&quot; (12.7mm) 
&gt; heads, and is not held on by one big nut.  Since more than one of you 
&gt; has mentioned the fan falling off, should I worry that mine might 
&gt; someday as well?
