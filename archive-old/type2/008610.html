Subject: Gas filler safety alert
Mime-Version: 1.0

Adding to the comment that in non-do it your self states the attendants can
#$%^ it up- note the following even if you do it yourself.

NJ is also a non-do it yourself state to fill gas- and I still do it myself
with our 78 Westy, convincing them it's better I hold it than them wasting
their time having to hold  _at_^#_at_%# pump with the spring loaded
anti-pollution cover- You are subject to CRACKING the upper fill connector,
which is rubber- I speak from experience- you let them jam it in until the
coil holds it there it lays horizontal &amp; it will eventually crack the back
of the rubber bent fill neck, especially old stiff ones.  You must hold
these nozzles up while filling so the end of the filler faces down.  I'd
like to see an aftermarket METAL filler pipe........
