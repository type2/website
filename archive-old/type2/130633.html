Subject: brake light

I have a problem with our brake lights, they come on every so often. I put 
new switches last year and drove the bus for the summer then it sat for the 
winter. Put a new motor in it then tried everything to see what was working. As I 
said every couple brake pedals the lights come on. Is this the switch and if 
so there are 2 how to check them without removing , if I remove them does this 
open the brake lines so I will have to bleed the system. Thanks Dylan
