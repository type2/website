Subject: RE: [T2] Seeking a side step support

I am also looking for one, the rear on mine broke. So If you find more than
you need for a good price let me know.  Does anyone know if the ones from
Bus boys are the same, and will the sides be the same as the orig ones?

Hello All,

Looking for anyone in a similar situation that would have one bad as well
that
is willing to part with.

Kind Regards,
