Hi,

	Well, I spent Saturday morning replacing the left heat exchanger on
my '77 pancake. Unable to find a &quot;German VW&quot; exchanger I once again fell
back onto the Dansk one- is it possible that the fit quality has actually
dropped since last time?

 After filing the mating surfaces flat and working the thing into place
I found that:

 (1) There is near zero clearance between the top of the exchanger and
	the engine mounting bracket.

 (2) The silencer fitting holes missed the studs by about 10mm! 
	requiring a considerable amount of filing and general hackery
	to get the system together at all.

 Although I was able to get the system assembled and sealed I have
very little confidence in its durability. In fact I have a deep
suspicion that the reason the exchanger failed is that it had
to have similar treatment last time. The components are assembled
under strain and as heat takes its toll they are likely to fail,
compounding this, I think that the exchanger is probably striking
the engine carrier when the engine is under load- transferring
strain to the mountings and the welds in the unit.

 Does anyone have any suggestions as to where to go from here?

 is there a better quality exchanger available, or is there some
way I can modify the system to alleviate the problem? At the moment
I feel that I've wasted two days cobbling together a system that
is so poor quality that I'll have to do it again in a few months.
 I f I have to do this again I want to be sure it's done right- I
would expect that the VW exhaust/exchanger system should last at
least five years.
 If I'd wanted that sort of grief I wouldn't be running VWs!

Cheers,
	 W.
