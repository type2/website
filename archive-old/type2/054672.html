&gt; &gt; Well, the rest of today I'll work on the interior panels. Mine are in
&gt; &gt; decent shape.  I was going to put some Thompsons on the backsides and
&gt; &gt; clear urathane semigloss on the front.
&gt; 
&gt; Don't do that. You want the same material (semigloss polyurethane varnish in
&gt; this case) on both sides of the panel--if you don't you'll run into
&gt; moisture-absorption problems and possible cracks, warps, etc.

I disagree. I have a bus full of panels with thompsons on the back and
they have not warped.
