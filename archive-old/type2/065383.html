&gt;If ANYBODY out there has a manual for a BA6 - I'd be most grateful!

Jay,

I believe there is some detailed info on the BA6 in the Bentley Vanagon
manual (80-up) since the BA6 was also used on early vanagons.  You might
want to appeal to the list for someone to photocopy this info for you.

I don't know about the Florida bus club the Espar representative referred
to--perhaps MOMBA? (Metro Orlando Microbus Assoc).  If this is the one, here
is the contact info (taken from Joel's list in the vanagon archives):

MOMBA
c/o Tony Morton
2318-B Simpson Ridge Circle
Kissimmee, FL 34744

Also, I received a post awhile back (I believe it was from Stefan Ufer, but
not 100% sure) regarding new parts availability for some Eberspacher heaters
in Europe.  He mentioned that Bosch dealers over there sell parts for
certain gas heaters.  Now, I've never inspected a BA6 up close, but if your
heater has Bosch components it may be possible for you to get parts across
the Atlantic if you make a contact.  I'd like to hear Tom Johnson's feedback
on which heaters used Bosch parts (if he's not busy in his workshop forging
a 40 HP crank ;).
