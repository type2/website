Since it seems that quite a few people are jumping on the bandwagon, I
thought I'd add my thoughts on the matter as well.

Many years ago, I went to the VW dealer to inquire about parts.  I was
quickly informed that they no longer stocked parts for air-cooled cars and
that they didn't have anyone qualified to work on them anymore.

It seems a shame that the very automobiles that gave VW their start in the
car market are now considered outdated by the dealerships.

&gt;&lt;&lt; Well, when I inherited my '78 Westy, I immediately went to the local VW
&gt; dealer (Houston) to get some replacement parts and was nearly laughed out
of
&gt; there.  Not only did they not have any in stock, they were completely
&gt; uninterested in even trying to help me get any parts.
&gt;
&gt; Maybe just my local dealership, maybe not.
&gt;  &gt;&gt;
&gt;I once had to drag an old service guy over to the parts counter to convince
&gt;the &quot;parts man&quot; that VW built a pickup before the Caddy (rabbit truck).
&gt;The dealership has been most helpful in obtaining parts for my various air
&gt;coolers over the years-- NOT!
&gt;In fact, they seem to want to make you feel like an idiot for still having
&gt;them.
