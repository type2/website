&gt; I have a 67 ghia vert that I'm restoring now that has been in more then 20
&gt; movies. It belongs to an individual, not a movie compony. He has told me that
&gt; the people that make the movies knows that there were/are alot of aircooled
&gt; VW's  out there and when they make a movie that took place in the 60'and 70's
&gt; that  they want them in the movies so its more realistic.

did he mention what they pay him to use his ghia??
