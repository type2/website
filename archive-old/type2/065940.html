The Split  - Bay hybrid you refer to is truly a fuuny animal! We have one in
England...just fully restored and converted to RHD (profiled in last issue of
SSVC mag)...do you want a picture and some info...? Trade for a story and photo
of anything interesting you find in S America!
BTW - we must have walked by each other in Holland! And are you in Denmark? Do
you know Greg (of NEATO background?)
Check out the posting re event in UK next July!
