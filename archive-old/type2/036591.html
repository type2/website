Jack -

I've always had pretty good results with the DieHard.

Consumer Reports called the DuraLast (from Auto Zone I think) it's best
choice.

I hear Optima's are good, but expen$ive.

I wonder if one of those 105AH Deep Cycle marine batteries would have enough
cranking amps to start the motor. If so, the added reserve capacity would be
a benefit whilst camping, etc..

&gt; We have a fleet of four ac vws o n our &quot; lot&quot;.  The neighbors might not be
&gt; as enthusiastic about this as we are, but.......
&gt;
&gt; Two of these  -  a bus and a '79 vert  -  have been sitting throughout the
&gt; winter months while I rebuild engines.  In the past week,  I've finished a
&gt; rebuild and needed to start an engine on a test stand in the garage. Two
of
&gt; the four batteries which worked just fine last autumn were dead and
&gt; wouldn't take a charge at the local gas station.  Both were less than
three
&gt; years old. So it looks as though I'm in the market for batteries.
&gt;
&gt; Before I head on down to Sears,  does anyone have good or bad experiences
&gt; with various brands to share?  Does any  brand beat the odds and give a
&gt; good unit every time?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks, Jack
