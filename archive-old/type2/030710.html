Clarification (hopefully) pre-hyperventilation:

This is NOT the stuff that is actually attached TO the doors of your westy
cabinets.  It IS the stuff found INSIDE after you have already opened the
doors (the jambs, if you will).  It fits in a 1/16&quot; kerf(groove) in the
plyboard/chipboard/whatever to protect the exposed edge.

Still great, but not the Holy Grail.
