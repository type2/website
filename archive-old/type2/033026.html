Well, after much thought and the guy coming down to a price I could live 
with, I purchased a 1972 panel van. They claimed it was a '71, but it had a 
pancake engine. Also, they claimed it had never been repainted, but the nose 
look like it has. Also, they said it had sat since 1972, but even that I 
dont know about.

Does anyone else have a bay window panel van or know how many were produced? 
I also need an engine for it. Im located in Florida, so the closer the 
better.

David
