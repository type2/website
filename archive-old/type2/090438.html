Subject: Re: [T2] hot times

Michael,
	I have to disagree w/ you on this one. 212 was my initial thought
as well on what temp the oil should be. The I thought about a pot of
water on a stove. Now at sea level it should boil at 212F, but there
is some evaporation going on a lower temps. While the water vapor
will seperate from the oil at higher temps it should also seperate &amp;
change to vapor at lower temps, just not as quick.

&gt; 200 ain't hot-it's too low!!  It takes 212 to remove the water
&gt; vapor-even the valve to route the oil to the cooler doesn't open until
&gt; 190 deg (watch your pressure gauge).... I drive a 236,000 mi original
&gt; engine Westy and when it's over 90 out 240 deg is not unusual at 65 mph,
&gt; and I slow to 55 when it does, and it may go to 235 and stay there.
