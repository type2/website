Subject: Intermittent Vibration at 55

I recently took my new 82 Vanagon out for its first legal ride.  It is a 
recently rebuilt 2L FI with standard trans and 142K miles.  When it gets 
above 55 or so I am getting a consistent intermittent vibration.  Meaning 
the vibration comes and goes like a metronome.  I experienced this same 
vibration in a f*rd r*ng*r that had 250k miles and needed cv joint.  I am 
hoping this is not a bad engine bearing or trans problem.    Any advice is 
appreciated.
