Subject: Hot air blower rewiring/73bus.

Dear fellow buspeople,
  It's that time of year again when it gets chilly here in the mountains of
Oregon, and I just installed a modification of my busses heating system that
I really like and that may be of interest to some of you.
  To make a short story long: I installed an extra switch that allows me to
operate the hot air flaps and the hot air blower motor independently.
  As you may know, in the breadloafs (at least in my 73 bus) the hot air
lever in the dashboard (the middle one of the 3) performs 2 functions: It
mechanically operates the hot air flaps on the heaterboxes, and it
electrically turns the hot air blower on and off. The way VW has built this,
it is not possible to fully open the flaps without turning on the blower as
well: It comes on when the hot air lever is pushed down about 2/3 of the
way. This has always bothered me, because at highway speeds the engine fan
is perfectly able to blow sufficient air through the heater boxes WITHOUT
the electric blower IF you could open the flaps all the way, which you can't
without turning on the blower as well. The blower comes in handy at low
engine speeds and in severe cold (Yukon territory in winter!), but on the
highway it often is quite unnecessary. And it's spendy and makes noise.
  So here's what I've done: I took off the dash and plucked off the
brown\white wire from the hot air lever. This wire is the ground connection
of the hot air blower relais circuit (current track 4 in the Bentley wiring
diagram for the 73 bus, for reference...). I connected this wire to a
separate switch with control light that I installed in the dash. The other
side of the switch I put on ground.
  Result: The electrical function of the hot air lever is separated from the
mechanical one. I can now open the flaps all the way without turning on the
blower. My heater boxes are in pretty good shape, and usually this is more
than enough to make me all warm and fuzzy inside my bus.
  Try it and have a good winter,

                                    Gregor

              P.S.: Welcome back, Clara! Nobody tells stories quite like you
do...Everyone here was choking with laughter when I told them about your
latest engine rescue mission to Europe. Well done!
