Hi all,

I stripped the #3 plug on my 71 westy  and as I am short on time/space to 
pull the engine, the quick fix treatment is all she gets right now.

My question is, can I pull the head on my 1600 DP without removing the 
engine? If so, what hoops do I need to jump thru to make this possible?

OR,

Would I be better off just installing an insert into the head while still 
attached?  Any concerns with shavings in the engine or squaring the threads 
correctly?

Thanks for your help
Scott
