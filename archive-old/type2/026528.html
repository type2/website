Subject: RE:  Fried coil - I think?

&gt;Here is the problem - when I was installing radio in my bus I forgot to
&gt;disconnect the negative wire from the coil - now the wire in the
distributor
&gt;is melting down when ignition is on - is the coil toast ?.
&gt;Is it OK to run the wire to the radio directly from the battery ( fuse in
&gt;line of course)?

I feel like I've missed something here.  Why would you want to disconnect
the neg wire from the coil to install a radio?  And how would installation
of said radio affect your coil and distributor?  Where did you attach the
positive and negative leads for your new radio?

When installing a radio in a bus, you should be pulling power from the fuse
block from one of the main (red 16 amp) fuses.  If there's not on open
terminal there, use a splitter spade and create one.  If you don't want your
radio to work when the ignition key is off, pick a fuse terminal that
doesn't have power.  If you do want it to work all the time (ie. turn the
radio off only with the radio's off button), pick a fuse terminal that
always has power.  Whichever one use choose, pull the fuse out until you've
got everything hooked up (and the radio's ground wire is attached to the
chasis) then put the fuse back in.

I know, I know, there's some other possibilities (such as 17 gigawatt
amplifiers that need power directly from the battery), but that's the gist
of it I think.
