&lt;&lt;  Can an '83 vanagon tranny be used in a late '70's loaf simply 
by swapping  the nose assembly on the tranny? The '83 tranny in

of the tranny. &gt;&gt;

Possibly, but I haven't researched that one myself.  If a simple
nosecone swap won't work then you would have to change the
gear carrier as well.  And to do that you have to disassemble the
gearbox!  Also, on the nosecone sideshifters of '80-'83, there is
a casting on their gear carrier housings that may interfere with its 
mounting in an earlier Bus.  If the simple nosecone swap does
work but the casting interferes, then there shouldn't be any reason
as to not cutting it off for clearance.  

But, again, I've not done any research into this transaxle swap.
