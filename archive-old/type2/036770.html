Subject: Power at RPM is lousy

Hello everybody, 
I have a 79 bus (CA edition) that suddenly has no power. What happens
is that when I am at low RPM every thing seems normal, when I try to
accelerate fast it sputters and almost seems ready to die. It also does
not seem consistent. Sometimes (rarely though) it seems to work regularly.
If I try to accelerate slowly I have no problem. If I put the hammer
down regardless of the speed I am at my bus just coughs like Pall Mall
victim.

Thanks - CLW
