another story for All Hallow's Eve .... :)



An Old Tale from the Deep South

It was a dark and stormy night.  The strobing flashes of lightening
darkened
the already deepening shadows inside the old Volkswagen camper. The
flames
of the small campfire flickered, like the tongues of snakes, as the soft

moaning of the wind increased. The trees bent over the campsite, their
limbs
draped in Spanish moss like old scarecrows in the tattered remnants of
clothing long gone out of style.

The little camper rocked slightly in the wind.  The old fellow at the
gas
station hadn't mentioned any storm. He only spoke about how this
campground
was haunted by the spirit of Jean Pierre Bapaume, one of the original
explorers of this area, who accompanied Iberville on his trek through
the
swamps of Louisiana, Mississippi, and lower Alabama. Somehow the story
didn't seem quite so laughable out here in the dark.

What was it he had said? Bapaume had been hung by the others from one of

these very trees, and swore vengenance on any who dared seek refuge
here?
The old fellow never did say exactly what it was that Bapaume had done
to
deserve hanging.

I looked at my watch. It was nearly midnight. I hadn't realized it was
so
late ... the sky seemed strangely light, almost like twilight. Suddenly,
out
of the corner of my eye, I saw an armadillo walk out of the bushes along
the
road and head straight for the fire and me. I threw a rock in its
direction,
but it kept coming. As it reached the light of the fire, its eyes glowed

greenish-yellow, and their gaze seemed fixed upon me.

&quot;Are you to be here when Jean comes?&quot;  The voice startled me, a
high-pitched
squeaking voice, with a terrible accent.  I stood up from my lawn chair
and
looked around, wishing I had brought some sort of weapon.  There was no
one.
Only the armadillo and myself. Then the armadillo stood on its hind
legs,
looked straight at me, and the voice again said, &quot;Are you to be here
when
Jean comes?&quot;.  It was the armadillo speaking.

I stared at him for a few seconds, then decided the storm and the beer
were
playing tricks on my mind. I threw a beer can and hit the armadillo on
the
snout ... he vanished.  No smoke. No noise. No nothing. He just wasn't
there
anymore. The beer can went right through him ... or rather, where he had

been ... and rattled down the dirt road.

Now I was sweating. I got the flashlight and walked around the campfire,

shining the light on the dirt, looking for tracks of some sort. There
was
nothing there. No sign that anything had walked over that ground in the
last
two hundred years. I didn't like this turn of events. I looked at my
watch
... it was exactly midnight. The wind was now only a soft whisper in the

trees, stirring the tatters of the Spanish moss.

I turned off the flashlight and started to walk back to the camper, when
I
noticed a rather large possum, sprawled out in my lawnchair. Like some
bloated lifeguard at the beach, but with eyes that were glowing red in
the
firelight. His eyes flickered somehow, as if glowing from within instead
of
reflecting the light of the campfire.

&quot;Are you to be here when Jean comes?&quot;  The voice was deeper than before,
but
the accent was just as bad. It was definitely the possum speaking ... I
could see his mouth move as he struggled with the English words. And he
shifted his weight in the chair as he gestured with one of his forelegs.

He apparently took my shocked demeanor to be misunderstanding, so he
repeated his sentence, pausing slowly at each word, and speaking louder
than
before.  I swallowed, and replied, &quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;I wish to know you still be here, when Jean comes&quot;, he croaked. &quot;Jean
do
not like you to camp here. Jean do not like people at all.&quot; As he said
this,
a twisted sneer of a smile played upon his features. If a possum can
smile,
that is.

Geez, I thought, now I'm talking to a possum in the swamps of Alabama!
How
old was that beer? I picked up a stick and walked around the campfire,
intending to defend my lawnchair, when the possum just faded out of
view. He
hadn't run away, or even moved ... he just faded out of sight.  I
carefully
felt all over the chair, but there was no warmth, no smell, no hair, no
nothing.  Only me, the crackling of the fire, and the whispering of the
wind.

&quot;Are you be here for Jean?&quot; This voice was deep, very deep. My spine
grew
goosebumps the size of golfballs. The voice was behind me, on the other
side
of the fire. I looked at the windows of the camper, to see any
reflection of
what was speaking, but there was nothing reflecting but me, the fire,
and
the woods beyond.  I turned slowly around.

An alligator, about ten feet long, was lying on his side, picking his
teeth
with a claw.  He looked at me with bright blue-green eyes that seemed to

steal all your willpower to resist. I looked away quickly and stared at
the
fire. The gator raised up on his rear legs, and sort of sat there, using
his
tail as a prop. His pale white belly glistened in the firelight.

&quot;I mean,&quot; he said, &quot;Do you stay til Jean comes?&quot;

&quot;Man, if you ain't Jean, I'm GONE!!&quot; I shouted over my shoulder as the
Land
Speed Record was broken by a 1971 Volkswagen Campmobile.


I don't drink much anymore. I don't camp at places without at least
three
other campers there ahead of me. And I NEVER stay up past ten o'clock.
