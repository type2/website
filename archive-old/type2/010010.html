Chad,

I've always used a roll around Sears 2 ton floor jack.  I've pulled a '77
Westy motor using a floor jack.  Just slide the motor out onto the jack
and get it balanced, lower it and wheel it where you want it!  It's
best to have a buddy with you though &quot;just in case.&quot;

&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone in the Sunnyvale, California vicinity has a cherry picker -
&gt; style engine hoist that I could borrow for a couple of days, I'd be much
&gt; obliged...
&gt; 
&gt; Alternatively, suggestions are welcome for methods of moving a complete
&gt; TypeIV motor from inside the cargo area of one bus, into the garage, and
&gt; then (later) installing it into another bus.
&gt; 
&gt; TIA,
&gt; 
&gt; -chad
&gt; '72 westy (with compression getting lower by the day)
