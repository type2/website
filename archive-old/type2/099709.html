&gt;I wonder why they don't make a sender that you can use with a short piece of hose and then run a wire anywhere.

Probably because it would cost more money and be more complicated and prone to failure.  A long hose works just fine and at 1/4&quot; thick isn't all that much larger and harder to route than a wire.
