Hi all -
And I wrote yesterday -
&gt; that the coil is faulty. Now that I have replaced the coil on general 
&gt; principles, how can I be sure that IT is the failure point, not 

And now for an answer.  BTW the coil was $72 YIKES, '80 CA version.
The FOR SURE answer is look for leaky black thick gooky stuff coming 
from out the under side of your coil at the wiring end.  That really 
and truly will tell you that it is fried.

Now for the followup question, for 10 bonus points.
Is this leakage, presumably the cause of death, due to internal stuff 
happening or (hate to think) external heat from overheated engine?
