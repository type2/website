&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; A friend just bought a 1980 Westy which I am helping him fix, and I am now
&gt; looking for a Westy myself (way too cool).  I have been searching the
&gt; archives for information on transmission kickdown issues, and a seeming
&gt; slip/slide into third.  I am hoping to gain information and assistance into
&gt; the workings of the auto trans in this van.  The real question is, what is
&gt; the kickdown switch, how is it adjusted, and are replacements available?
&gt; This Westy was converted from FI to carb, and I do not see a switch
&gt; anywhere.  I had one place tell me it is manual, the throttle cable goes to
&gt; the trans, then a rod goes to the throttle body, but that doesn't match what
&gt; I think I found in the archives.  Help please?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,

There isn't a switch, per se.

Kickdown is controlled by the throttle linkage, as you found. The cable end
is attached to a lever on the transmission case which operates the kick down
valve on the transmission. If the cable is not adjusted properly it will not
kick down. The top of the lever is attached to the rear throttle linkage,
which is a rigid rod attached to the throttle valve.

When the pedal is floored, the lever on the transmission should be a few mm
past the detent point, you can feel it easily when you are under there. If
the throttle linkage is adjusted right, and no kick down, then the valve
body may be bad.

If the bus was converted to carb, I wonder how the linkage was done? Is the
throttle linkage in the engine bay a 10mm steel rod? That is what it should
be for an automatic transmission bus. Maybe the linkage is missing, so no
kick down possible.
