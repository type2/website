Howdy --
In reference to the parcel tray thread -- I've got the trays, but the
wooden shelves I've got in there now rattle a little too much for my
patience, and I would like to acquire the cargo netting that I've seen in
other versions.  Anyone know where I can get ahold of this stuff?  I
suppose I could come up with a pseudo replacement, but I was just wondering
if they're out there...  thanks!
