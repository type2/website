&gt; I've got a 72 transporter with a 1/3-2/3 split bench seat up front and
&gt; I'd like to make the switch to two bucket seats.  Has anyone done this?
&gt; I don't have the bucket seats to look at so I'm not sure how much
&gt; modification is necessary.  The only thing I know for sure is my spare
&gt; tire currently sits under my front passenger seat so that'll have to go.

I did it many years ago, took out the double.
put the tire on the front of the bus (flame war bait)
bolted solidly a seat there, don't remember where I got it, don't even
think it was a bus seat.
took a sabre saw and cut out some of the backrest down to the top of the
seat base.  didn't cut that.
smoothed the edges and put something on them and drove for many miles.

I wanted walk thru....
