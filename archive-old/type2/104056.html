Subject: Rocker Panel replacement

Its time to replace the drivers side rocker panel assembly on my '74 bus.
Oddly, this is the only place on the bus that has rusted out really bad,
aside from the battery trays which I already replaced.

All three of the panels need to be cut out and replaced. I have the
replacements in hand. My question: what is the best way to weld the new
ones in?

should I weld the inner most panel in place first, then the middle and the
outer rocker panel last? or should i weld them together first and then
weld the assembly into the bus.

Theres gonna be a lot of alkward welds in the process and I want to get it
right the first time, and for the job to be as neat as possible.

I would appreciate any empirical advise.

thanks 
Eddie Goodwin
