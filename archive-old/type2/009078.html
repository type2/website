My parking brake would frequently stick, but I usually could get it going
by putting the bus in gear and using force to get it to pop loose.
However, one day, it wouldn't come loose no matter what I did.  One wheel
was free, but the other would actually slide across the driveway.  I
stopped before I did any permanent damage and called my mechanic.

He said that the brake cable will often freeze up.  He suggested cutting
the cables near the brake (don't confuse the parking brake cable with the
main brake hydraulic line!), releasing the parking brake, and driving it to
the shop so he could put new cables in.  So, I cut the cable, but the
brakes were still locked!

I finally had it towed to the shop where he said it took quite some effort
to free the brakes.  He said that this was fairly common on busses and
suggested not using the parking brake all the time.  He said to save it for
parking on hills.  So, now I just park the bus in gear without the brake.
