Anyone out there still have a manual box on an aircooled vanagon?  If so,
could you advise me on:

- Correct interval for changing gearbox oil?
- Correct lubricant for the nylon bits of the gearshift linkage?

Thanks, in advance for all replies.

I, in turn can give some advice....  If your gearshift feels sloppy, get
underneath and check that the spined bracket bolted on to the gearshift shaft
is tight.  It's much easier to sort it out before it falls off.....
