Subject: Re: [T2] What's your MPG

Hi Jason,

Slow down, and you will save a lot of $$$.  I find that my bus gets  
comparable milage at 65-76, but I can get closer to 25MPG on trips  
made at 55MPH.

A lot of the time on long trips I will also try to save gas by  
letting a big truck or another vehicle push the air in front of me. I  
don't get close enough to call it &quot;Drafting&quot;, just enough to feel  
some of the resistance recede.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; I tracked my mileage for the last couple of fill-ups and got 17 and
&gt; then 16.5 last night. Now my office is 25 miles from my home, and I am
&gt; doing some pretty fast driving (up to 80) to keep up with traffic or
&gt; just because I can. However, when I filled up last night and got 16.5,
&gt; I decided that my lead foot would be no more. I figured that Zoey is
&gt; 32 years old, runs well, but is still old and just because I CAN  do
&gt; 80 on a straightaway doesn't mean I should! Granted, I am sure that
&gt; the camper top adds a little more weight and wind resistance, but
&gt; 16.5... Holy crap!
