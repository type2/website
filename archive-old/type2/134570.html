Subject: Westy project for sale

It is with regret that I must change directions midstream.  I live in SE
Oklahoma and putting up for sale my '79 Deluxe Westy (Mexican Beige) project.
I say project because it is totally taken apart save for the fuel tank and
tires.  Body work has been completed except for some rust that would be sanded
off before painting.  Major body work was done on the front panel under the
windshield and the battery boxes.  Had the work done professionally and looks
great.  When I bought it 3 years ago, the previous owner had not driven it due
to tranny not shifting into 2nd.  I have bought a used tranny.  Engine tin has
been removed for powder coating but was not done.  Inside has been cleaned
out, parts catalogued/photographed when removed/stored, windshield clean,
small nick on rear lid, &amp; canvas was trashed.  Does not have factory rims.
Have been puttering on it for 3 years and feel that I am not devoting enough
time to make this Westy dream come true.  I purchased it for $1200, spent
$1650 on parts/body work.  Will part with it and trailer it somewhere in
300-400 mile radius for $2000 negotiable.  Would make a great project for
someone else with more VW knowledge and motivation.  Just needs put back
together with new owner's desired changes.  Email me for pix and more
information.
