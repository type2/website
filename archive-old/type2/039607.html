Subject: Carver Technology to Close (Carver P4 Heaters)

Some of you may remember my report last fall that Carver Technology who makes 
the P4 heaters that I sell, was bought out by their competitor, Truma of 
Germany.

I received a fax yesterday from Carver announcing that as of July, 24, 2000, 
they will close the factory and will no longer be manufacturing any heaters, 
or other propane products.

They will however, continue to supply replacement parts and service and will 
honor any warranty.

I have contacted Carver and arranged to purchase any left over completed P4 
heaters when the factory closes.  The current plan is to build only to 
current orders, and if everything goes as planned, there will not be any 
heaters left.

If I receive any discounted units, I plan on offering these to listmembers at 
whatever discounts I can negotiate.  I will  not have any further information 
on discounted units until July, so please be patient and wait for me to post 
details.  Also, I will not be placing any new orders with Carver other than 
the arrangement to buy any left over units.

I'm not sure if I will be offering the Truma units as replacements for the 
Carver heaters or not.  The Truma units are very similar and have some added 
features.  The downside is that they are more expensive.

Those of you that have purchased the heaters from me the past 2 or 3 years, I 
will continue to offer support as long as I can, and will assist with any 
warranty issues if they arise.

I have one spare unit in stock that I will keep until at least next fall in 
the unlikely case that any P4 sold in the past year fails.

I think those of us that have installed the P4 will continue to have a great 
little heater to use well into the future, and we are fortunate that Truma 
will continue to support the product.
