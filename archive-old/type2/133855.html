Subject: Re: [T2] Remove gas pedal

&lt;&lt; On a 76 is the pin on which the gas pedal pivots supposed come out?  My 
pedal
has one of the hinge points gaped to the point it can be removed with the pin
in place, but I suspect this is not right and why my pedal feels floppy.  I
know that on my 181 the two holes are the same size and the pin is just pushed
out the side to free the gas pedal.  However, on my 76 bus the pin is so
rusted I can't tell if is is fixed or not.  I gave it a few good whacks with
the punch and hammer but it didn't budge.  I don't want to beat too hard until
I know it's supposed to move. &gt;&gt;

FWIW, I replaced the rust-full hinge by bolting a solid brass strap hinge to
the floor (brass plate under the floor for added support) and the long leaf
of the hinge to the gas pedal...The strap hinge was already 50+ years old
so should have another 50 in it... ;-)
