Hey all,

  Been searching the world over for the 68 brake fluid reservoir that I
need.  Think I actually have a line on two of them.  Youd better
believe I am buying them both!  The Frankfurter has been stilled in my
yard for weeks now, me and the kids are bummed out over it.  Plus it is
beginning to get cold around here.  No more drowzing under the bus while
Im working on it.

  I have been putting off timing the engine because if I accidentally step
on the brake pedal Ill have to bleed the brakes again.  Been reading in
the Bentley manual, Idiot manual, and the instructions that came with my
new shiny chrome timing light.  It sounds easy enough, Ive seen it done
once or twice.  But not doing it and thinking about it is causing me to
have doubts.

  Found an article on the use of regular vs. premium gas at the Boston
Engine site.  He states that us air cooled folks should be using premium
because it is not the same gas that was available back in the day.  I am
tempted to do this and see what becomes of it.

  Went back to the locksmith today.  The owner was working and he found
that he had a bunch of the blanks that I needed.  I had one made online,
but I needed it cut to the owners manual code anyhow.  Had several
made.  He told me he had a bunch of Renault blanks he couldnt get rid
of either, told him I didnt have one.  He said nobody else does
either...

  The trip to New York nears.  Trepidation.  How do buses handle in snow? 
I already know they get blown around by the slightest breeze.

Thanks for everything,
Jennifer
