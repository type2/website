Hi all-
   I would like to thank Jerry publicly for his &quot;Aridzona&quot; bus sale postings 
too. I am currently looking for a 78-79 Westy or a nice splitty bus- And sure 
do appreciatte his postings- along with the postings from the New York, CT 
areas! You folks do a great service to us midwest folks!!  I too, will 
probably end up buying one from afar....
   Thanks again
    Brian
