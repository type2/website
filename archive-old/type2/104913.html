Subject: [T2] How do you turn a tight engine
 
&gt; I am thinking of lifting up the rear of the vehicle, putting the
&gt; tranny in 1st gear and turning the rear wheels.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone tried something similar? Will I be able to turn the engine
&gt; backwards to get the 1-2-3-4 reverse firing order if I did this?

Uh, No.
Take the plugs out.
If you can't turn the engine now, you got real problems.
