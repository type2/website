&gt; Hey volks,
&gt; Last time I did my CVs I had my mechanic walk me thru it and he showed =

&gt; washer.  My mechanic had told me to leave it on.  I took it off to see =
&gt; and I had more than a little play.  I was not comfortable with this play =
&gt; so I left the washer on.  What are the pros and cons????

I think that the spring pressure from the bellville washer tended to cause
the snap ring to pop out.  If your snap ring and groove are in good shape
it shouldn't be a problem.  I run mine without the washer and have no
problems either.
