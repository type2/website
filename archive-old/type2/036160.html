Subject: Know your buses and thier history.

VWTrends March addition 2000 features 50 years of the Bus. Maybe now I can 
understand all the jargon people like to use on this list server. 

I have a question: Why do people call the 73 bus engine a 1700 when the mag. 
indicates it is 1795cc?  If rounding is use then it would be more accurate  
to call it a 1800.
