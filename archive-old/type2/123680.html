Subject: RE: [T2] alternator charging voltage?

I had a very similar problem a few weeks ago on my Westy.  I cleaned all
the electrical connections on my fuse box with a Dremel Tool felt wheel
and alcohol (disconnect the battery first) and then cleaned up all the
connections on my battery and in the engine compartment i.e. ground
strap connection, starter connection, etc.  I no longer have the faintly
glowing light and my bus turns over MUCH faster after cleaning up the
battery connections.  My voltage at 3000 RPM with a stock VR is 13.8
volts.

I seriously doubt your engine hesitation has anything to do with the
glowing light situation.
