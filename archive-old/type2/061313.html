You may be right on the money, but if you call to order parts or accessories
from any after-market supplier in Europe, I suspect they won't know what a T3
is.  All of my parts and accessory catalogs list the Vanagon as a T2, and the
Eurovan as a T4.  They usually further give the years to not confuse the
Vanagon T2 with the Bus T2.
