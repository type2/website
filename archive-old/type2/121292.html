Subject: RE: [T2] Bus Publications?

Price must have gone up a little. I have been paying $34 for each year for the
last 3 years.

I like the magazine. It has articles about some very unique busses in Europe.
They have a lot of the one of a kind busses. It uses a nice quality paper
also.

IMHO $30 is not to much to pay for this mag. Especially since no one else
seems to cover just busses like this.
