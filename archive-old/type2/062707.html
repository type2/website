&gt; Well, why does it make a difference, compression-ratio-wise, whether you
&gt; put them under the cylinder or on top of it?

CR wise you are correct; on top makes no difference;&gt;) However, you now have 
two mateing surfaces to seal against leaks, the top of the jug to the bottom of 
the spacer aand the top of the spacer to the head. The pressures are high in 
this area. If you put the spacer at the bottom of the jugs it is easy to 
seal;&gt;) 

 
&gt; This all shows you how much *I* know. I never heard of putting them under
&gt; the cylinder before. And I have got 1600 rebuilds that had spacers on top.
&gt; Of course the engine I'm thinking of blew up after a few hundred miles. But
&gt; I don't think that's why. ;)

I have read claims that the shims on top setup allows carbon to build up in the 
seams and cause pre-ig.

 
&gt; Are the &quot;shims&quot; that go under, of some different constuction than the
&gt; &quot;spacers&quot; that go over?


A *shim* and a *spacer* are really the same thing. I can't imagine a 
difference in construction other then diameters. The shims I've seen are made 
of steel, with tight control of thickness. A head seal is copper. Its soft 
enough to *flow* into place, and forms a high temp seal.
