Subject: '78 Westy Low Beam Headlight

One of my low beam headlights does not shine.  The high beams are OK, but
sometimes the left, and sometimes the right low beam will not shine.

Always ONE of the two will be dark.  It has switched from the left to the
right, back to the left and then back to the right low beam headlight being
dark.  No particular reason, just switched to dark on its own.  But ALWAYS,
for more than the past year, ONE of the low beams has been dark.

When I measure the voltage on the low beam socket when I take the bulb out,
I get a very low (digital measurement) voltage reading.

What causes just ONE of the low beam lights to get this low voltage, and not
the other; and why does it switch back and forth, always ONE being dark.

So, right now, I drive with my HIGH BEAMS only, but I am due for a safety
inspection soon, so I need to get this solved.

Thanks.
