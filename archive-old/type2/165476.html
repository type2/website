&gt; &gt; It seems that with anything from China, the importer has to watch the

&gt; Seems the norm is to hire a company to hire a factory...The lead-painted

I was referring to the procedure if you want to import a good quality
product from China.  Every manufacturer in China is pretty well insulated
from liability because few of them have any business presence in the US
and an foreigner's chances in the Chinese court system is nil.
