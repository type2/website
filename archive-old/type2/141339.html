Subject: Re: [T2] Bumper color for 1970 cab

Hi Adam,

    Here is the address for Wolfsburg West (
http://www.wolfsburgwest_dot_com/index.cfm ) they have a good listing of
Volkswagen paint codes. Unfortunately the 70 is not listed. Although the 71
is. ( Bumpers: L 90D Pastel White )  Most likely their the same: anyone????
    Even if their not, it would be hard to tell, unless your trying to do a
Car Show Trailer Queen!

Good luck,

Howard
