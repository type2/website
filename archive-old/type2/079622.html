Subject: Re: [T2] 71 Westy needs a lot of power on brakes...is it the brake servo
 problem?


I got the servo rebuilt on my 71 by an outfit in Texas (around Dallas I
think) for around $70.  They did a great job and 4 years later it is still
working great.  I found the name and number in the archives but if you
can't find it I can probably dig the name and number out of my bus file...

Best of luck!

71 Bus


I have 71 Westy and the brake pedal needs a lot of pressure. I've driven
many type 1 over the years, but this is my first bus, and it certainly
requires more pressure than the type 1. The seller told me the bus needs a
lot of pressure on the brake and that is normal. The seller did not know too
much about the bus and I am now thinking maybe something is wrong with the
brake servo. I checked out the price for rebuild servo and it is around
$250. Is there brake servo rebuild kit I can buy and work on it? Also, do
you think the problem is the brake servo or maybe something else?

Thanks!
