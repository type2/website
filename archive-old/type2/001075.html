After six months I've acquired all the missing duct work, bowden cable and
timer switch (turned out to be for a BN6) for my BN4 gas heater. I tried to
follow all the wiring instructions that were in the library.  I tried to
bench test it this weekend. Without a correct switch I have the gray wire
and the red wire unaccounted for. If I ground the brown wire and put power
to the two bottom terminals on the flame switch the fan runs and the spark
fires but the fuel pump won't pump. If I put power directly to the pump, it
will pump once and I can manually get it to squirt gas by doing this, but I
can't seem to get power to the pump- or the pulse needed to pump. My
understanding of things electrical  is severely challenged. I hate to think
I might have fried something while trying wiring possibilities........As I
tried different combinations, the relay switch would tick. I hope I haven't
done any damage.

Q: Is there a way to complete a circuit with just teat leads to find if this
thing will work?
Q: Does anyone know how to  wire a BN6 switch to a BN4? The wiring
numbers/letters are different.

Thanks,
