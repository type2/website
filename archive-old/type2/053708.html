Alister,
	Twin plugging came from the heady days of Mike Hailwood and the Isle of Man
TT's, prior to Capacitor Discharge or Electronic ignition. I reckon you
could do better with that sort of hot spark from either of those ignition
options and with a lot less engineering problems.
	Extractors, CD ignition and smaller jets were a good economical and
powerful combination for me a few years ago...

&gt;
&gt; Has anyone heard of a mod. to the engine where an extra spark
&gt; plug is added
&gt; to each cylinder? I remember reading about this &quot;twin plugging&quot; of
&gt; motorcycle engines especially big twins such as BMW's and Moto
&gt; Guzzi's years
&gt; ago. The benefits are supposedly increased efficiency in burning
&gt; the gases
&gt; with improved power coupled with increased M.P.G.
&gt;
&gt; Any thoughts?
&gt;
&gt; Regards  Alister.
