Subject: cylinder ?
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I just bought a 73 camper.  It only is running on three cylinders.  The one 
cylinder blew out because ( the guy I bought it from said), the heat syncs 
went on it.  What are they? Is it a problem to fix them? Could that even be 
the reason? 

Thank You
