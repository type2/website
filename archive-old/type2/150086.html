Subject: Re: [T2] fans

I have one mounted on dash thru an existing screw from the guage pod  
face plate.  The power is supplied from cigarette lighter.  Works  
just ok.  It is especially nice having a little breeze blow on your  
face while sitting in traffic and 95 plus degrees outside.  don't  
remember where i got it and what brand though.

&gt; I've determined that I have to have a fan.  I've seen
&gt; them mounted on dashes in some of the pics I've seen.
&gt; Have any advice?  Are they wired up to run with the
&gt; engine off?  How long before it kills the battery?
&gt; Any bad experiences with them?  Recommendations?
&gt; Specific models would be nice.  Cheers....KR
