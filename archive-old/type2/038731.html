Hi everyone-
I just joined the list about one week ago and have been reading daily and enjoying the general good atmosphere and friendly help offered here. I have two questions I could use help with. After some attempts to use the archives search with little luck, possibly due to my own ineptitude, I am now posting them here. I am a daily driver with a 76' ASI Riviera which I have had for about 1 year. 

Question #1 (The more important one!)
     This evening as I was listening to my bus idle and noticed a noise, slight even ticking, which seems to have crept up unnoticed untill today. On pulling spark plug cables, I noticed that when #3 was pulled there was no noticeable change in RPMs while when the others were pulled there was a considerable drop. The plugs are new (less than 1000 mi.) and the compression was checked about the same time and ran 130 plus or minus 5 all around. I have a Weber progressive 2-barrel, center mount carb,installed by PO, which was been a real PITA to get adjusted, but I don't think that has anything to do with the current problem. I also noticed that when I reved the engine, it sounds like it was missing. Should I replace the cables? I would greatly appreciate any advice and help. (Should I even drive tomorrow?) Also if anyone has a similar carburator, I could use some help with getting it properly adjusted. (The auto choke has been disconnected since I bought the bus, and I have seen no vacuum hoses either.)

Question #2
     When it rains, I get water on the floor under the dash. Is my windshield seal or the front air vents  leaking? 

Thanks for any help and advice.

peace-
