Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] OT: Verizon Phone Service for Bus Traveling

&gt; Make that strap a long one. I was 10 feet short with
&gt; the Cherokee. I did 
&gt; have a come-along on that trip but no handy trees.
&gt;

i've been told and shown by 'thing' drivers but i
forget how long it was to also have a metal pole and
driver you can set in the ground and pull against so
when there are no trees you can still come along your
self out.  good idea if you spend a lot of time in
isolated areas cuz even if you can make cell signal
calls to 911 sometimes they aren't clever enough to
find you.  
i watched the search plane fly over me but they never
got to me on the ground.  come a long didn't help in
that situation.....
