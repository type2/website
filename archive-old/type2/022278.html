You were unclear as to the reason for the law under which the city is 
threatening you. Just because the neighbor thinks it is an &quot;eyesore&quot; 
doesn't mean the city can tow it. On the other hand, if it doesn't 
run/can't be driven/isn't registered with plates, then there are grounds to 
tow it as a junk car.  I think you need to be specific about what grounds 
the city is using to have it towed and scraped. If it is a true &quot;eyesore&quot; 
law, then maybe you can cover it up or build a fence around it so it can't 
be seen.

Perhaps all you need to do is cover the car with a conventional 
car/truck/camper cover.

Another idea beyond steel wheels without tires (which I think is a good 
idea) would be to have it towed or flatbedded or driven to another location 
such as a storage yard for boats, campers and trailers. Pay the $25 a month 
storage fee until she can afford the repairs. You could do this if the 
appeal was not authorized, or no hearing is granted. You could have it 
towed yourself to a safer temporary location, where it won't be scraped.

Idea number three: Make arrangements with the repair mechanic to pay his 
fee in installments, like so much up front and whatever she can afford per 
month. This would get the bus fixed, and would avoid the $25 wasted money 
storing the bus.

Or, sell it if a buyer shows up.  Make sure the bus doesn't get sold, and 
then towed and scraped before the buyer can have it removed. That would 
compound your legal problems.

Bloody nosy neighbors... My Mom is in San Diego, and has a '78 Westy
(auto trans). It's not the prettiest car in the world anymore, and at the
moment is in need of repair, for which the mechanic quoted $900 or so,
which is more than she can currently afford. One of the local Mrs./Mr.
Grundys has turned it in as an eyesore, so as of the 23rd she has 10 days
to do something or it gets towed and scrapped. ....snip...............
