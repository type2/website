&gt; I'm pretty sure XZX are passenger car tires
&gt; 
&gt; I have been running MXT without any problem for years.

I didn't have any problems with the Michelins I was using on my utility
trailer until one day the tread peeled halfway off with no warning.  Wiped
out the fender.

My father didn't have any trouble with the Michelins on his Ch*vy van
either, until the day that the tread peeled and wiped out his rear fender
well.  It's amazing how much damage a 3 foot long whip of rubber and steel
wire can do while decelerating from 60-0.  Curled the rear lip of the
fender completely up into the well and removed all the paint from the well
to boot!  It looked like someone had gone after the fender well with a big
hammer followed by a coarse wire brush.

I've heard of others having problems with sudden tread peeling on
Michelins too.

Considering the fragility of my VW fender wells, I won't be running
Michelin tires any time soon.
