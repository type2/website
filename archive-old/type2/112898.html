Subject: Re: [T2] does anybody know?

I'll take my best shot.

your spring adjusts the air fuel mixture (AFM) for your car.  turn turn 
it one way and it will have more oxygen (LEAN) the other way is more gas 
(RICH)  what you want is a BALANCE.  sadly most do it yourselfers like 
ourselves don't have exhaust gas analyzers (EGAs) to measure the gas so 
it's hard to get it right.  When you adjusted it did you do it yourself? 
 To get things right on I'll take it in after a tune up and hav it 
done... havn't needed to do so for a long time.  I get good mileage and 
emmissions.  I had a porche mechanic do the tweaking.

You bring up an interesting point though.  I'd be curious to know how 
others adjust their AFM.  To the best any plae with an EGA should be 
able to help you out or you  can buy one (they are of course very 
expensive).


&gt; Rockies. Well, my gas mileage sucks. I need to adjust the spring back. 
&gt; It isn't worth it. I get like 14 mpg.
&gt; Does anyone know what this spring is or how to adjust it.
