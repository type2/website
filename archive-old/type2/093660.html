Subject: Re: [T2] What's this Ink Stamping?

I have seen reconditioned engines with very similar markings.  This may 
reflect the date of  placing back into service.  I cant see that spot on 
my engine but right above there is where VW put the stickers specifying 
the recondition type and status.  another sticker stated date was 
stamped on case but not where.

&gt; When I was cleaning and stripping my T4 case I noticed this stamping on
&gt; the case. Anyone have any idea what it was for? The numbers seem to read

&gt; ones in a Junkyard. IF you look in the picture, from the link. It's
&gt; right below the Crankcase breather.
