Subject: Re: [T2] bumper reflective tape

It really does depend on you locale I guess,, the old plan around here was to
warn and educate people about misuse of the sign,, but it seemed that they
couldn't stop people from marking DRIVEWAYS with the SMV sign,,  coupled with
lack of funding, and job security, They targeted the misuse of the SMV sign ...
the MTO stopped warning , and started writing fines.

My neighbor got a ticket for having a SMV sign on his driveway post. Cost him
$127.00 Canadian, [about 2 cents American!] so big deal eh?
LOL
The MTO didn't bother with anything other than large trucks before,, now, they
grab what ever fines they can get to pay their wages.

Well , that is in southern Ontario Canada any ways...

&gt; Plus, feel free to ignore all the Jailhouse Lawyers on the list who predict
&gt; heavy fines and hassles from the police..... It hasn't happened to me and
&gt; I've been driving my bus WITH THE ORANGE TRIANGLE in place for several years
&gt; now.
