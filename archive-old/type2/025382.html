&gt;&gt; The 1973 Bus did not come with a 2.0 FI engine. The 1973 came with a 1700

&gt;&gt; a std 1600).
&gt; 
&gt; In the US, all 1973 model year busses came with 1679cc (&quot;1.7L&quot;) engines.
&gt; They were all normally aspirated - in fact the only Type 2's that were ever
&gt; *not* normally aspirated were those with TDI engines (I don't think there
&gt; have been any in the US).  Fuel injection or carburation has nothing to do
&gt; with being normally aspirated.  Normally aspirated refers to the lack of
&gt; forced induction, such as a turbocharger or supercharger.

Thank you for the correction. I've learned something new and stand
corrected.
