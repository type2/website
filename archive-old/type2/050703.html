Subject: [T2] Gas Heater Parts (long)

Hello,

     I had an awful experience with Gordon Hayman.  The full story of my BN4 
installation is posted on Ron Van Ness' BN4 website, though I have 
summarized some of it here.  Please excuse the length.  I ordered a BN4 
heater from Hayman Motors over the phone, leaving a credit card number as a 
deposit for what was described as &quot;tuning, testing and prepping&quot; of the 
heater. I was clearly promised a complete heater for installation in a '73 
Westfalia. Before I purchased the heater, I spoke to a tech person at Espar 
who said Hayman Motors sold good reconditioned heaters and would honor the 3 
month warranty that came with it. After all, Espar listed Hayman Motors on 
their own Web site. What I received was a pre-72 heater including 60's 
ducting which didn't come close to fitting my bus. Missing was all the 
ducting beyond the firewall, cover, electrical relay, exhaust pipe, switch 
and basically everything else. Worst of all, the heater obviously hadn't 
seen action since the Nixon administration in spite of the story about the 
tune up and prep. The fan revved erratically, slowing as it caught on the 
gunk inside of it. The fuel pump didn't work at first, but after taking it 
apart and cleaning and setting the points, it ran, dislodging a hefty 
quantity of crud into the glass orange juice bottle full of fuel. Responses 
to my many phone calls to Hayman Motors ranged from, &quot; I'm looking for your 
parts on microfiche&quot;, to &quot;my guy is getting your parts from a bus out back&quot; 
and later on, back to the microfiche story.  Basically, whatever he had to 
say to get me off the phone. The parts never arrived and he even went so far 
as to say during my final phone call that he had sent the parts and that I 
was lying in order to get him to send me extra parts. He also refused to 
refund the purchase of the non working heater when I realized the test and 
prep was nothing but a story, but did offer to &quot;fire up&quot; the heater for me 
if I brought it back to Toronto. Pure shame almost keeps me from telling the 
price I paid....$500 Canadian, about $375 U.S. I informed Espar as to what 
had happened and told them that publishing Hayman Motors name under theirs 
reflected badly on them.  The heater in question, packed in an inviting 
cardboard box, was eventually stolen from the back of a car.  The insurance 
deductable....You guessed it....$500. I tell myself that this heater was 
destined to burn my bus to the ground and sometimes I even sound 
convincing...

     I sincerely hope that you have better luck than I do with Hayman 
Motors.  You are probably better off trouble shooting your heater on your 
own.  The list seems to have just about everything ever printed on them in 
the archives and they are fairly easy to repair once you take the time to 
understand how they function.  I would be happy to try to answer your 
questions.

-James.
