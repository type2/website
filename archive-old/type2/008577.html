I just got done removing a BA6 from my 79 parts Westy. That was the last 
thing left in it. I had plans to put this heater in my 77 Westy. After 
cutting all the welds to remove all the ducts I'm not so sure anymore. I 
can't imagine anyone retro-fitting one of these! This thing has 3 
supports welded in that are staying there. They support the main unit. I 
haven't figured out how they put in the fresh air duct to the back 
seat....that one is staying in. It curves around the torsion tube and 
has zero clearance between it and the body and it and the torsion tube. 
I did separate it and get the half that the blower mounts to, the halves 
were welded together. I may have to figure a way to duct it to the heat 
outlet under the rear seat. There is no hole in the floor for the rear 
heat outlet on the 79. When you ordered the BA6 with the bus, the rear 
floor pan is different. It has holes and places for holes my 77 doesn't 
have. ... it may be for sale......
