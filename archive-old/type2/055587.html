Subject: 74-79 westy poptop

i finally found a '77 fibreglass poptop. picked it up for $100 at
&quot;russ's recycling&quot; near irwindale, ca. they let me take EVERYTHING. the
roof interior, canvas, twin bed/padding, etc, etc. they wanted me to
take the welded off westy roof too, but i couldnt fit in my friends
truck. it would have been nice to have for measurements. i might go back
and pick it up. the fibreglass top itself is in real good condition. the
canvas is torn and ripped, not a big deal.

anyways, question!!! obviously the holes in the top of the front luggage
rack, are for water runoff. if thats the case, where does the water run
off to, the rubber seal around the bottom of the fibeglass? after i took
off the front luggage rack at the junkyard, there was piles of dirt,
even wasp nests. does the rain run off through the uneven-ness of the
rubber seal maybe?

thanks, dave
