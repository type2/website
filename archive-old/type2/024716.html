Greetings Volks
Well like a bad disease, I picked up what I think is a bench seat westy 
yesterday. Some had thought that it might be a Riviera having come from 
Oregon, but looks like might be a westy. Two things make me think that, one 
its vin is 239 which is Kombi and Campmobile, second it appears to have spent 
time in New York making me think it might be a Europian import (also looks 
like the lid is drilled for a Euro plate). Does anyone know what the camper 
layout should be or any links for pictures? Has anyone seen one before, maybe 
our European friends? Looks like with the bulkhead there should be lots of 
room for cabinents and without a spare tire maybe a full bed
thanks all
Chuck
