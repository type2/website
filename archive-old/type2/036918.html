&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone know of any decent heaters that plug into the cigarette lighter?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm about to embark across Canada with no heat...
&gt; &gt; go to good ski shop, buy skibib, down coat, warm gloves, heated socks.
&gt; You can also go to a motorcycle shop and get electrically heated chaps 
&gt; Defrosting the windows?  No idea!  I generally reserve my sojurns up north
&gt; for the times when the geese are there.  Geese are no dummies!

I'm a skier and have a gas fired Eberspracher(sp) in my van, drive in a
blizzard in shirt sleeves and the windows clear!!!

keep the geese off the slopes, cuz here I come.
