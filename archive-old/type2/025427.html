&gt; I think that colour is called Sierra.  Does anyone have a bay window parts
&gt; list?-- it should list the L code that the paint supplier can use hopefully
&gt; to mix that colour.

Sierra Yellow is really a dull pumpkiny orange that was found on 71 and 72
buses. The colors that look like school bus are Brilliant  Orange(73  and
74) and I think Marino Yellow(74-79). These are mid 70s colors mostly found
on Sunroof Kombis(mostly westies. Can't tell you the pain codes. Someone
once told me the real school bus color is called Internationl Chromium
Yellow.

Better kill this thread before Thom wakes up:)
