Subject: Re: [T2] newbie repairing totaled bus

Good point....

&gt;if you are &quot;buying it back&quot; from the insurance company you will probably get
&gt;a salvage title which might make it harder to sell later........

I guess if I had the keep it forever mentality about this bus (like I have 
mine) I wouldn't care.

Another approach - and I don't know anything about state regulations out 
there - is not to deal with the insurance company and authorities and just 
do this out of pocket.
