&gt; How in the world is one supposed to know what's domestic and what's
not? Most ot the Japanese carmakers build at least some of their cars
here in US. And &quot;American&quot; cars are built in Canada, Mexico, central and
South America. _at_0 years ago my Mom bought a Pontiac cuz she wanted to
Support American workers. Some time later she found out that it was
actully assembeld somewhere in South America.

Well, I can say for certain that my bus was definitely assembled in
Germany, probably by Turkish &quot;guest workers&quot;  :)

Of course, the engine was assembled in Mexico, the brake components in
Brasil, the motor mounts in India, the tires in Japan, the alternator
in Spain, the exhaust in Italy...

It's become far more international over the years!
