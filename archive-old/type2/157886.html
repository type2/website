&gt; My question is, is there a corresponding piece that mounts to the

&gt; order a
&gt; whole kit for the slider if I don't need the whole thing.

The seal contacts the sliding door all the way around. I'm not sure  
what effect it has but there is a plastic piece at the edge of the  
carpet on the Westy. I'll take a photo...
