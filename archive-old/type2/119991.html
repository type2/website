&gt; Hey folks...

&gt; I'm going to be in the LA area from Dec 21 to Jan 4, visiting my
&gt; in-laws for Christmas, and was wondering if there were any listies in
&gt; the area that might be interested in getting together some evening for
&gt; some holiday cheer.

LA is a big place.  Can you be more specific?
