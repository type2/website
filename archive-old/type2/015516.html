&gt;Today, he told me that the Georgia heat justifies permanently removing the

 I don't see why he would bother....Call me old fashoined but I take the
 view as many others do that if VW put it in there,it's meant to be there.

  He also indicated that the flaps
&gt;aren't too critical for warm-ups in the *reasonable* winters here...

 That's probably true,but why permanantly disable the flaps? If the weather 
 is warm the concertina thermostadt thingy will open the flaps in a very short
 time anyway and everythings sweet.If the thermostadt fails the flaps
 default to the open position anyway,again no problem with them left in-situ.

&gt;I've never heard this before, and I certainly don't remember seeing it in
&gt;Muir.  Does anyone have any perspective on this?

 VW built a world car (or van) It can/could be found in every continent on
 earth.The Australian scientific boffs even had two Beetles in Antartica
 back in the '60's.VWs were built to withstand (within reason) all
 manner of climatic conditions.They didn't for example put the flaps in
 ones destined for cold countries and leave them out of ones for hot
 climates,otherwise the Australian ones wouldn't have the flaps either.
 Even warm places have cool times and it's nice to have the engine up to
 operating temperature as soon as possible and if you need it,the heater
 will be a-happening too.Never before time in an aircooled VW!

 I just don't understand why your mechanic would want to permanantly disable
 something that can only be of benefit in cooler weather and have no negative
 effect in warmer climates.

 But that's just my opinion...
