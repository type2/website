I read the article by Ken Hooper in the library section on timing for a 009, 
but I still have a question. I have a 71 Westy with what I was told was a 
Mexican type 1 engine (it has no engine numbers on it), it also has oversize 
cylinders so it is at 1832cc, and a 009 dist. I am trying to time it and 
currently have it at TDC running around 850-900rpm. Should I rev it til 
there is no more advance and then set the 30degree mark on the wheel to TDC?

When the manuals have different settings for different years is that only 
because of differences in distributors or are there other factors. I read 
71's should be either at 5 ATDC or TDC but now knowing which engine I have 
exactly has me guessing.

Thanks for any help I can get,
Brendan
