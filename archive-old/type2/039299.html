Subject: Re: O2 Sensor on '78 Westy

This sounds like a '79 california spec car.  Is the catalytic converter
mounted parallel to wheels or does it run side to side (i.e. parallel to
the rear bumper)?  If it is parallel to the wheels, congratulations, you
have a cal spec engine, making exhaust parts difficult to find.

The oxygen sensor wire runs up through a hole in the engine tin on the left
(driver's) side of the engine and connects to a single wire (not sure the
color) coming out of the FI wiring harness near the double relay.
