Subject: Re: [T2] The mystery Single Cab

Guys are you considering the posibility that the bus was made to be export 
to another country beside USA, I mean my 1977 Westfalia, yes is a 1977 and 
the option are correct acording to the M code plate, was made to be export 
to Venezuela, and there are few diferences with a USA version, front disk 
brakes with out booster, 1600 DP carburated engine instead of 2.0L injected, 
ice box no fridge, no stove, the wiring is different too, using the diagrams 
provided by Bentley workshop I found a sort of mix betwen a few years.
Maybe and I not sure on this the bus has the correct options did you check 
the M code plate ready ?
