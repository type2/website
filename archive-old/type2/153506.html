Gentlemen, and ladies, of the list, take time,...to enjoy who you are and what
you do...and if you are an associate of this list....what is your ride....and
take a &quot;Big Look&quot;... and &quot;breathe&quot;, and say.....aaahhhh! These &quot;buses&quot; are an
icon of a &quot;space in time&quot;, and no choclate rabbits, or &quot;cute ladies&quot;, with
pink ears, will ever change that fact,..&quot;Dig&quot; in and enjoy...there are
immeserable &quot;things&quot;, that come with &quot;them&quot;!  Have a Happy Easter, or
Chocolate Rabbit &quot;time&quot;
