Well, I have a little more to add.

Wires in a vibrating object like a car are generally of the stranded type,
presumably because solid wires are prone to breaking. However when you start
soldering them you actually turn them into a solid wire. The soldered end
will become brittle and is a probable source of breakage. Actually the
crimp-on connectors are not so bad. The trick is that you have to apply
proper pressure when crimping them on. In the factory they will use heavy
duty tools and connectors that correctly match the wire diameter. Also the
isolation on the crimp-on connector supports the wire so it will not break
so easily. Back in tech college I was taught the following procedure for
stranded wires that have to be screwed down in plugs, terminal blocks,  etc.

- Remove about an inch (2.5 cm) of isolation.
- Hold the soldering iron at the end of the stranded wire and let the solder
flow so the strands are soldered together.
- then cut off most of the soldered end leaving only about 1/8 of inch (2-3
mm) soldered.
- screw it down on the unsoldered part.

Two reasons for this. As I said, the soldered end is brittle and likely to
break just at the point where it leaves the terminal block or whatever. And
over time the solder will 'flow' under the pressure of the screw causing the
connection to loosen.

So I have no hesition in using crimp-on connectors. But make sure you use
the right diamter for the wire and crimp them on with all the power you have
in you. Use proper tools, makes life easier (ever tried to use one of those
plastic tools to mount an RJ-11 telephone plug and you know what I mean).

One more note: unsoldered connections can actually be better than soldered
ones. I found that hard to believe when in the seventies wire-wrapping came
into use in the computer industry. But the electrical connections made with
wire-wraps had a lower resistance then soldered connections. But here again
the procedure must be carried out with the proper skills and tools.

Well I guess you never knew there was so much to say about a liitle things
as joining two wires.
