Subject: RE: [T2] Urgent Clutch Help Needed!!!  UPDATE

&gt;This morning while driving out of my apartment complex, I pushed in the
&gt;clutch, then all of a sudden it fell to the floor and did not come back up.
&gt;I managed to limp back to my apartment and park it.
&gt;I can move it up and down freely from underneath the bus, there is no
&gt;tension what so ever.
 I just crawled under the rear of the Bus to check the cable. It was
extremely loose, so I think its probably broken.
On the end of the cable is a wing nut with a couple other regular nuts. It
was just kind of flopping around. Perhaps the cable broke somewhere inside
the tube?
