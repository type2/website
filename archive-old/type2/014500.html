To: Vanagon_at_vanagon_dot_com, Type2_at_type2_dot_com

Just wanted to wish everyone a great Holiday, and thank you all for your 
support this past year.

I'm looking forward to another great year in 2001 and hope to get out and 
meet more listmembers.

Merry, Christmas, Happy Holiday, and Seasons Greetings from all of us at 
EuroCampers.
