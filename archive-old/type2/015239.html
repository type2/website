Subject: Compufire Won't Fit
Mime-Version: 1.0

I saw the posts in the archive about the rotor issue, but this is a
different one...I have not even gotten that far.

I cannot make the &amp;^%$ thing sit in the hole while making it line up to
screw it down.  Let me say that better.  That teat will not sit in it's
spot without the unit sitting sideways and practically forcing it in.  It
is hitting against the outside of the shaft.

I can remedy this by &quot;shaving&quot; the bottom corner of the unit right in the
middle where it is hitting the shaft but...

1)  I don't know if it will hurt anything...
2)  I don't think I should have to modify it to make it fit a stock dizzy.

It is going on a 1970 Westy, 1600SP, stock vaccum advance dizzy.  The box
says something about vaccum advance on it, so I think they gave me the
right one.

Has anyone else had trouble getting it to sit in there?  Trust me, I tried
for about an hour.  I can get it in the &quot;teat hole&quot; but when I do the hole
for the screw is WAAY off.  I can make it barely fit, but not sitting flat,
just with it sitting sideways and the screw going in crooked.

Thanks for any help
