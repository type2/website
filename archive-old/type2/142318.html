Subject: Re: [T2] Heating

The gas heater is great but the OEM system is good down to freezing temps IF everything is present. I have a friend with a Riviera that makes great heat down to freezing or did before the outer layer of the &quot;U&quot; tubes rotted off. Lowered heater box output temps significantly and thus the interior temps. 

When it works right the OEM system isn't bad but most folks don't take the time to fix it and like me don't realize that some of the details like the outer skin to the U-tubes exists until much later.
