I saw a neat setup at the Bug Out in Manassas a few years back. The Thetaford
Porta Potti was used as the base for a (foot)stool that fit in the space where
the Westy stool goes, between the single seat and the icebox. The owner covered
it with upholstery to match the rest in his van, with a little extra foam on the
top and the sides to make the same height and width as the Westy stool. It
looked just like an ottoman. The upholstered cover simply pulled off straight up
to expose the stool. Occupied the space normally taken up by the Westy stool.
Not sure where he kept the TP. He didn't demonstrate.
Me, mine's still under the seat that is behind the driver, but when I
reupholster the interior, my Westy stool is going in the garage. I want a place
for my toolbox. Oh, yeah, I like my Thetaford, too.
BTW, does anyone know what the strap that is supposed to hold the Westy
footstool in place looks like?
