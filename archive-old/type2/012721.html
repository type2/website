Hey there,

Yep. http://www.type2_dot_com click on the Bartnotek button.

Direct link is: http://www.type2_dot_com/bartnik/tech.htm srcoll down to
the fi section.

also check out Sami D's AFC trouble shooting page.

I like Chapter 13 of the Haynes manual. It covers the major
components of the FI system. I've got the Bentley (and Muir), but I
find I use the Haynes alot more then the other 2 resources. 

As always, before you troubleshooting the FI system, verify that the
other systems (starting sys, ignition - timing and dwell, etc.) are
in spec.

Later...
