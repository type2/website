Subject: Re: 50-100 lbs. and Mileage

Theoretically, yes.

Your gas tank holds about 100 pounds of gas. Can you feel the difference in
performance from empty tank to full tank?

A good test would be to top off after a half-tank three times and calculate
the mileage, then top-off after the tank nears empty three times and
calculate the mileage.

The mileage on the half-tank should be slightly less, due to you carrying,
on average, more weight around (the other half of the tank).

Another benefit of travelling light is less pressure on the brakes and
tires.

I'd have the kids unload the camping stuff.

&gt; Would 50 to 100 pounds make a difference in gas mileage for city
&gt; traffic.
