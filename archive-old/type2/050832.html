Subject: [T2] Re: [VB] MetWiz Pieces and EveryBus 2001

Kelly, who became famous for his ability to remove chicken wire, bondo and spray foam and replace it with correct metal, is expanding his business in the direction of fabbing parts. I am lucky enough to be sporting the prototype set of MetWiz jack points on the '67 bus. For those of you who would like to see the fruits of Kelly's labor in person we will be conducting the now famous MetWiz shop tour on Saturday during EveryBus 2001.

Kelly made me up a set of lower b-pillar sections for the '54, mirroring
the pattern he has for LHD buses.  They came out pretty dang good, considering
that he's probably never seen a RHD barndoor before...
