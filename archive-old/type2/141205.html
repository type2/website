Subject: Re: [T2] CB Radio Antenna install

I knew better... but didn't care...

I mounted my shakespeare 102&quot; fibreglass whip off the side of my trailer hitch
tongue , usually on a coil spring mount.

right at the center back,, right in the way of both rear doors... poor location
for transmitting from, ,poor location for accessing the oil dipstick,,

but I didn't really care,, &lt;grin&gt;

That sucker gets out .. looks good &lt;imho&gt; and as long as I remember to pick it
up off the gas station ground before I drive away,,, I am happy!

Here is my story.

I can't seem to buy the HD coil spring mount any more,, the old springs were
made of 3/8&quot; wire,, the new HD ones are 1/4&quot;
The 102&quot;  &quot;whip&quot; does just that ... whips around at high winds with that new HD
spring mount. So, I do not have the spring and it works fine,,, except when
checking oil.

That is when I unscrew it.. and set it beside the van,, check the oil, clean my
hands,, hop in and drive away,, leaving the ant. behind!
Last weekend I did just that!    lol
So I got smart the second time.. and propped it in the trailer,,,  I won't
forget it there!
It took me a while to figure out why the radio was soooo quiet!    At least I
still had the ant with me.. it just wasn't screwed into the mount!

Ok,, the fix to that.  One day, I am going to move the mount over to the side of
the bumper,, just like jdd did... so the ant. lays along the body to the left of
both doors... and put a tiny hole in the rain gutter to clip it there.

I use a tennis ball on the ant to keep the ant from chipping the paint off..

Works very well for me....  does doulble duty as a newfie wind-meter.... as it
is visible in the rear window...
while driving,, if it is:
centered in the window,,, head winds &lt;giggle&gt;
 if it over to the right.., or left ,,, light cross wind...
if it is visible in the front door rear view mirrors .. heavy cross wind.....
it is laying flat out ,,, clipping passing cars,, Hurricane winds!!!.... been
there once tooo often!

btw... Calculation for Range of an Antenna:
Square Root of Height (in feet) above ground x 1.42 = Range in miles

using that ,,,, the square root of 8 ft is 2.8  times 1.42 = 4
so.... even the best ant.  on a van in optimum Tx should only get out 4 miles.

I only need to get out 1-2 miles,, I usually squelch pretty heavy so only &quot;in
sight&quot; vehicles are audible.. but I want very strong and clear modulation....
and that is what I have!
:-)

just my perspective......
