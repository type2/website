As someone with the same setup, I'd suggest that you check to see if the
throttle plates are completely open when the gas pedal is pushed down;
you'd be surprised at how much better it will accelerate when the carb is
opened all the way......BTDT....8^)

&gt; Ok, so I did a major once-over on the Bus this weekend to try to get it
&gt; ready and registered.
&gt;
&gt; First things first:
&gt;
&gt; I have the Bus running, and running pretty decent. Like I may have
&gt; mentioned before I have the single DUAL port Webber carb atop a small
plenum
&gt; that's attached to four ridiculously sized runners into the intake ports
of
&gt; the motor. In any case, I am curious about the performance of the Bus.
From
&gt; say.. 0 to 30 miles an hour, the Bus actually does get up and go pretty
&gt; decent. But from say 30 to 40 miles an hour, I need a drag strip. I was
&gt; under the impression that this was a motor I could easily drive on the
road,
&gt; and go say.. 50-60 miles an hour regular cruising if I wanted to without
any
&gt; problems. How did all those people make it to Wood Stock in these things
if
&gt; the top speed was 40 miles an hour? So, this brings me to question my
car...
&gt; what can I do to fix this? I'm assuming this is not normal. Could it be
the
&gt; way my motor was built VS the way it's presently geared? Granted.. I
wasn't
&gt; flooring it... but it sure was taking a long time to get to 40.
