Subject: RE: What's the biggest box you've fit in your split?

The only consumer item I've ever purchased that didn't follow the &quot;four foot
rule&quot; (ie &quot;this box will slide into a Dodge Caravan&quot;) was a plastic back-
yard gym from Toys R Us.  Two of its knocked-down components are about 
5.5x5.5x1.  Feet.  When I stood them next to the Vanagon I understood why
the stockroom guy right away asked what I was driving when he saw the
order form.  I had to go home and take the middle seat out, AND the only
way the big pieces would fit was sticking out the side door.  I guess the
concept is that you're supposed to tie them to the top of your station
wagon, but I've seen two many flying mattresses to like doing that.  Ever.
