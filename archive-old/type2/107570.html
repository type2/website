Subject: $$HELP$$     Front deluxe trim still needed !!

I ran around through several web pages of people finder type things with no
positive results, then dialed directory assistance for Ormond Beach,
Florida, &amp; they came up dry also. So, I do not know the guys phone number. I
did find out that several &quot;Tyler&quot; members live in the Ormond Beach area.
Even the addresses were listed. No &quot;Bill's&quot; though. No &quot;William's&quot;, either.
At least as far as the info on the web.
 If you pass by this &quot;1320 Hand Ave, #12&quot;, is it an apartment house, or a
place of business? The directory assistance people couldn't tell me anything
about that address. (By way of history, Jerry &amp; Melissa Jess sent out a call
for the 2 front trim pieces for a splitty VW bus, &amp; this Bill Tyler guy sent
an email saying he has one for $40, &amp; he can send it for $5, a deal was
struck, I sent him the $45, the check clears on 25.July, I email him on the
30th, he emails back saying I should get them by 9.Aug, I emailed him on the
18th, as well as the 28th to say they have not arrived, but I've heard
nothing from him. I guess I can send all this info to the District Attorney
of Ormond Beach's county, but that's a last resort &amp; I'd never see this $45
or trim ever. The DA would do whatever he does, &amp; what will be will be.)
Thanks, again.
