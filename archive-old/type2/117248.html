Subject: '65 new trans-trouble

Mark, you said:

&gt;This is not what you want !

You mean I don't want it in neutral?

It was the only way I could figure to know for sure which gear it was in.  I figured if all (3?) sliders where in the same position, that must be neutral, since all the gears would then be accessible?

&gt;You either did or didn't have all the shift rods in &gt;neutral.

They were all at the same depth into the trans. The hockey stick could slide into any of them.

&gt;Makes a big difference.

Tell me about it!

&gt;You might want to back things up enough to be sure. &gt;If need to take a screw jack , disconnect everything &gt;that holds the tranny back and screw back the tranny &gt;and remove the nosecone and check.

$24K question is, what would I be looking for?

Thanks,

Billy
