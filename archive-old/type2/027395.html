I finally got my timming mark on pulley and the rotor to line up correctly 
and I belive I have it timed  correctly, but everytime I turn the key it 
tries to fire then floods itself out.  I wait a while it will try to fire 
again then floods again.  HELP!!!!! I need to know if there is away to make 
sure the injectors coincide with the firing.
Thanks,
