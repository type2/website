Subject: Re: [T2] Solar Battery Charger

Hey Max, Sounds like something is draining your battery, not going off when
you think it is.  If you do have a battery drain, the solar panel will not
help much if at all.  My buddy tried the same on his Westy with the solar
panel and the panel cannot keep up with the juice the drain consumed even
here in sunny Eastern WA.

Good luck,
Nik
