Subject: Re: [T2] Bumper color

Guys, 

I found a virtually new electric oven for use with powdercoating for 
$100.00

Has both lower and upper ovens!

You can find one if you look...most are around $50.

Cheers ,dave

&gt; &gt; By the way - for those folks who get the Eastwood Company catalog. I've
&gt; &gt; heard good things about the home style kit they sell but the cost of the
&gt; &gt; kit far outweighs the cost to have a batch done professionally. Not to
&gt; &gt; mention you need some way to cure the powder which normally is an oven. At
&gt; &gt; my house my wife would be quite suspicious of car parts going into the
&gt; &gt; oven. And a bumper doesn't fit in my oven anyhow! &lt;grin&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Once you cure powder coating in your oven you have a Powder Coating Curing
&gt; Oven--you can't cook food in it ever again. Which really pushes up the price
&gt; of the Eastwood kit.
