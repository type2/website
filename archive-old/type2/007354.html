You should not have to remove the axle nut to remove your brake drums. 
When you have the rear wheels off look at the drum.  You should see two
bolt heads that take a 10mm wrench.  Remove these bolts and, if the
drumsare not rusted on, the drums should come right off.  If the drums
are rusted on, you've got a bit more work ahead of you but that's another
posting that should be in the archives.  It's been covered enough.

Hope this helps!

&gt;Also, I'm going to think about trying to fix the hand brake cables 
&gt;myself.
&gt;Do I really need a specially modified five-foot-long length of steel 
&gt;pipe
&gt;in order to get the rear brake drums off?
