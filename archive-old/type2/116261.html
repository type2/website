Subject: How do I replace my ignition lock?? Heh.

Hey guys,
 
    Well, you know I lost the keys to my Bus!! :( And unfortunately, all the
locks on ALL my doors are from different busses (none of them work yet). I
thought I'd just completely replace my lock cyl or the entire ignition lock.
I know the Bus Depot sells them so that's probably where I will get it from.
But that brings the point to.. how do I remove teh steering wheel and the
lock cyl? 
 
I know, I know.. check my Bently manual... I did buy one, but it's much
easier to ask you guys. I'm really just curious about what I'm up against.
The steering wheel looks nothing like anything I've ever seen. I mean
there's literally a long SHAFT that goes straight down into the floor-boards
of the Bus! Not like any other steering system I've ever worked with!
 
 
 
Thanks,
