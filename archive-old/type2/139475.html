Subject: Staring Issue Revisited

Hello all,
I doubt many people remember my original post, since it was 6 weeks ago.
Long story short........My 77 2.0L FI bus wasnt starting.
After much trial and error the bus finally went to the shop this week.
They got it started after replacing the spark plugs since they deemed mine
&quot;too cold&quot; (whatever that means), and adjusting the valves.

Here is the current situation. It starts, but doesnt idle well, and is
blowing out some black smoke.
My bus has never smoked before, so Im not sure whats going on there. It has
sat for 6 weeks waiting for repair.

The shop is saying either the CHT sensor, or the AFM.

What do you think?
Thanks!
Eric
