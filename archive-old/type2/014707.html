&gt;  My engine is running on after I shut it off. I checked the archives and 
the 
&gt;  suggestions I found said that its either retarted timing or a problem with 
&gt;  the idle cutoff. 

I've been hearing for decades that incorrect timing can cause running on. 
I've never been able to fathom that. When an engine &quot;runs on&quot;, you've laready 
turned the ignition off!!! Timing has no meaning when there is no spark.

I can see that an overheated speck of carbon could cause running on (I can't 
think of anything other than an incandescant spot that COULD cause running 
on) , but is that incandescence likely to be from retarded timing?

Jes' wonderin'
