If you have cabinets on one side of the seat you are a bit limited when it
comes to 3 point belts.  The easiest thing to do is have a 3 point belt next
to the window and a lap belt on the middle mountings, as per how VW intended
it.  This setup would be no less safe than the majority of cars on the road
anyway.  In the end it all comes down to how much risk you feel like taking.
If you can't handle the risk, don't drive the bus, you'd be safer staying at
home. :o)  I have two lap belts on the rear seat and two on the middle.  The
rear ones are safer because they are anchored to the floor.
