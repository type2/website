&gt; i should pack spare part wise and which tool i can't leave home with 
&gt; out......thank you so much

OK since it is Friday here are the ten most important tools for keeping
your type 2 on the road for a long time, don't leave home without em!

_______

1.  Duct Tape - Not just a tool, a veritable Swiss Army Knife in stickum
and plastic

2.  Vice Grips - equally adept as a wrench, hammer, pliers, baling wire
twister, breaker-off-of frozen-bolts, and wiggle it til it falls off tool.
The heavy artillery of your tool box.  Vice grips are the only tool
designed expressly to fix things screwed up beyond repair

3.  Spray Lubricants - A considerably cheaper alternative to new doors,
alternators and other squeaky items.  (strangly enough an integral part of
these sprays is thi infamous little red tube that flies out of the nozzle
if you look at it cross-eyed

4.  margarine tubs with clear lids - if you spend all your time under the
bus looking for a friendly pin that caromed off the pertal valve when you
knowched both off the air cleaner it's because you eat butter, real
mechanics consume pounds of tasteless vegetable oil replicas just so they
can use the empty tubs for parts containers.

5.  big rock at the side of the Road - block up a tire, smack corroded
battery terminals, pound out a dent, bop noisy know-it-all types on the
noodle.

6.  Plastic zip ties - after 20 years of lashing down stray hose and
wiring with old bread ties some genius brought a slightly slicked up
version to the bus parts market, 15 zip ties can transform a hulking mass
of amateur quality wiring into something remotely resembling a wiring
harness, Of course it works both ways, when buying a used bus subtract
$100 for each zip tie under the hood

7.  Ridiculously large snap on Screwdriver - Let's admit it, there's
nothing better for prying, chiseling, lifting, breaking, spliting or
mutilating than a huge flatbladed screwdriver, particularly when wielded
with gusto and a big hammer.

8.  Baling Wire - commonly known as type 1 muffler brackets, bailing wire
holds anything that 's too hot for duct tape or zip ties

9.  Bonking Stick - this monstrous tuning fork with devilish pointy ends
is technically known as a tie-rod seperator.  But how often do you
separate tie rod ends???  Other than medieval combat, its real use is the
all-purpose application of undue force, not unlike that of the huge flat
bladed screwdriver.

10  35 cents and a phone booth  -  cell phone that is actually charged
will work in a pinch.


Have a good trip
Bob
