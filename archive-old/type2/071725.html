Subject: Re: Utah meeting/summer rendevous'

Thanks Blake

I'll put it on my agenda.

I've been thinking of starting up some rendevous for Vanagons and 
Bays throughout the mountain west this summer.  I 've done this in 
past summers with people I've met on the list and it is fun.  Maybe 
we could discuss something like this.  We travel two to three weeks a 
month during the summer and enjoy meeting people from around the 
country.  Maybe we could sponsor a informal get together at such 
places as Rendevous Beach at Bear Lake or Calf's Creek Falls or even 
one of the Festival weekends in San Pete County.  We could invite any 
one who is traveling this way from either list.  Maybe they would 
reciprocate and we could visit their gatherings while in their areas, 
i.e. Festival Concerts  Weekends in both Suisun and Healdsburg 
Squares which are held every weekend thru out the summer months in 
Northern Califonia.  I think Boulder, Colorado also does this.

Just a thought, maybe we could get people on the list to post 
upcoming events in their areas that might be interesting for other 
listees  who might be traveling in that area.
