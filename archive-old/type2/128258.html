Subject: Fiberglass Insulation

Ive been doing extensive archive searching/reading and have a couple questions about insulation.

My 77 Westy is basically stripped at the moment....

http://members.cox_dot_net/ezgruv/images/DSC02336.jpg

...and I would like to take this opportunity to replace the existing fiberglass insulation.

Most of what Ive seen in the archives is dealing with vapor barriers.

Question one:
Do I need to coat the inside of the wall before applying new fiberglass insulation? There is nothing between the existing insulation and the wall currently (also no rust) - except whatever is adhering it to the wall.

Question two:
Is 'faced' insulation a good enough vapor barrier? Or should I cover it to be doubly safe?

For what its worth, I live in Las Vegas, NV, which equals no rust.

Thanks in advance, as always.
