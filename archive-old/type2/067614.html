Subject: Re: Analog Clocks

This reminded me of one of my first experiences with a VW.
My '67 Sqbk's clock (analog, electromagnetically driven spring type) 
wasn't working.  Having heard that VW clocks were nortorious for not 
working, I was bound and determined to get mine working.  After 
playing for awhile, I attached live wires to it and started poking 
and prodding with a screwdriver.  Eventually I made contact and BAM, 
tick tock for 5 minutes.  A real heart stopper, to have a clock SLAM 
back to life.  Then it stopped, more prodding, BAM tick tock for 5 
minutes. After about an hour of this I finally found a spot where a 
rivet had fallen out.  Unplugging clock, I wrapped some 
copper wire though rivet holes and it still lives 20 years later.
