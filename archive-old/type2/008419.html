&gt; I tried looking through the archives, but couldn't find the exact
answers I
&gt; was looking for...  Is it worth getting hydraulic lifters, and have
you had
&gt; any problems with them?  I'm considering getting a longblock (with
&gt; hydraulic lifters if it's worth getting them) from Mofoco. Also, is
Mofoco
&gt; a good place to buy from, or is there a better company?

Hydraulic lifters are a good thing, but their installation must be
well-engineered.  They need an ample supply of clean oil to function
properly.  If you just slap hydraulics into a stock case you risk
having trouble down the road.

I'd say that the best source for hydraulic lifter longblocks is VW
themselves.  Mexican Beetles come stock with hydraulics, and the
engines available from Beetlemex come with either solid or hydraulic
lifters.

Hydraulic lifters are susceptable to problems caused by dirt in the
oil, so full-flow filtration is a must.  The Beetlemex engines solve
this problem with a filter attached to the pump.  The bad news is that
this filter can interfere with the rear bus motor mount and possibly
with the exhaust.

There are buses running around with this setup, so perhaps one of
their happy owners could illuminate us on the mods required to bolt in
the Beetlemex engine.
