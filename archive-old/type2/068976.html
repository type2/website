Subject: Re: Save your ball joints!

To All:

A boot made of oil-tanned leather is a valid replacement for those made of
rubber.  Indeed, leather was the first material used for this purpose and
often lasted for more than 20 years.

When first introduced ball joints -- and their cousins, the tie-rod ends --
were fitted with grease fittings.  Properly lubricated and with a good boot
(of whatever material) they lasted much longer than ball-joints of today.

Why remove the lubrication fitting?  There were two reasons, both produced by
the bean-counters who have largely replaced car-people in the upper-level
management ranks of all automobile manufacturers:

Reason One:  Consumer 'satisfaction' is gauged entirely on the FIRST owner of
a vehicle, typically measured within the first year of ownership.  After
that, they really don't give a shit.

Reason Two:  Sealed ball-joints and tie-rod ends are 'good enough,' meaning
they will last the three to five years it takes the owner to pay-off the
price of the car.   After that, they really don't give a shit.

Did anyone notice a common thread there :-)

Why didn't the dealers complain?  A few did but most greated the change with
joy.  Fewer grease fittings meant faster lube jobs... for the same price.
 And when it comes right down to it, they really didn't give a sh....   You
can probably take it from here :-)

- ---------------------

To be fair I should point out that this type of behavior isn't anything new.
 Nor is it likely to change.
