Subject: Another Jalousie Window Question

In the '68-'79 Bentley there is a picture of a jalousie window in a westy
being removed.  The instructions say (and the picture shows) there is a
white plastic trim strip on the inside of the window covering the gap
between the window and body.  This is the *only* one of these strips I
have ever seen.  Was this an item on earlier Westies that was deleted
later?  a fig newton of my imagination?  A rare option that only came on
the 23-window breadloaf?  Inquiring minds want to know!
