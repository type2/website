&gt;When the Front wheels lose traction, say right, the only friction in the
&gt;front is the wheels sliding sideways against the ground.

&gt;Can't think of a way to set up this situation is a parking lot.  It's
&gt;easy to force the rear end to slide (hand brake or goosing the
&gt;engine).  Forcing the FRONT to suddenly slide, don't know.

You'll lose it in the front from braking. In extreme circumstances (ice),
from rolling on an off-camber surface. In the former case, brake only in
the rear if you must brake, which usually means with the engine. In the
latter case, ruddering is virtually useless, disengage the clutch and roll
into it like you would with a rear skid and feel for grip, then correct out
slowly.

In all cases, thump that clutch right NOW and hold it down, that'll usually
get control back right away even if it doesn't slow you down any. Learnt
this stuff in the New Mexico high country; it doesn't matter how fast
you're going as long as you can steer through what threatens you. You don't
need to stop (usually) but you do need to be in control.
