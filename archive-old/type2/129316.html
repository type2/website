 &gt; This one is on the engine on the bottom toward the front

 &gt; on the upper right-hand side of fiche# 013-00, but it's
 &gt; mounted horizonally (not vertically, like on the fiche).

Mike,
If the pump is built into the block then it would be
the factory style pump used on 1.7 &amp; 1.8 liter engines
I believe...

This page has a photo of the fuel injection pump. This
page also has a link with a description of the double
relay and photo which you wondered if you had.

And for reference this an after market electric pump
used on carburetors.

A '77 engine would not have a factory fuel pump on the
block, so a previous owner might have changed out the
engine on your bus if that is what you have.  Can you
find out the code stamped on the engine block? It is in
front of the crankcase breather tower, usually under
oil/ grime.

With the code we can figure out what type of engine
you have and go from there.
