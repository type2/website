Subject: My B4 for ur tin!

Here's the guff... I had a zillion replies to my B$ gas heater posting 
and I think that's great. Here's the lowdown on the extra heater I have.  
Its in a 73 westy that is giving up its motor to help Folly cruise the 
asphalt highway one more time.  The motor runs and seems to be in good 
shape... I had it running just this past weekend.  I also tried the 
B4... it seemed to run well, but between the yelling back and forth 
between me and my VW buddy, and the fact that the gas leaked out of the 
tank the night before, I can't honestly say the thing blows enough heat 
to cremate Sam McGee  &lt;CDN plug here volks&gt;

Is this a possibility? Would anyone be interested in swapping a set of 
engine tin for my new/old 1700 cc pancake motor in exchange for the B4?  
I will, of course, include everything I can possibly take out of the 73 
that is related to the heater.  I'll pay postage for the tin, you pay 
for the heater.  Whadda ya say?
