Yes they did, and I actually have a set of Westlake tires on my bus.  They
are sold under other brands, but the DOT numbers of all brands start with
&quot;7D&quot;.

Don't panic if you have these tires, because it's likely that they are not
covered by the recall.

One point is that the recalled tires all have an &quot;LT&quot; designation in their
size.  The Westlake tires specified for our buses are designated 185R14C,
which does not have the &quot;LT&quot; designator.  I believe that the recalled
tires  are all in larger sizes for SUVs and Pickups.

Another point is that the DOT code ends in &quot;02&quot; through &quot;05&quot;, which I
believe designates the year of manufacture.  Mine are &quot;06&quot; and I got a
set from the first shipment my tire store received in January of this
year.  There may be older Westlake tires out there in 185R14C, but I
doubt it.

Of course, at one time I was suspicious of an Asian off-brand called
&quot;Hankook&quot;... :)
