Subject: Re: wiring weirdness

&gt;Does anyone have a feel for how accurate the Bentley is re: wiring
&gt;diagrams? The chart that shows which fuses protect which circuits bears
&gt;almost no relation to the reality of my fuse box.

i noticed that the wiring diagram looks like the fuse box is BACKWARDS, as
if you are looking at it from the FRONT of the bus, not the seat. look at
the wire colors (disconnect batt and GENTLY pull the damn box down) to
confirm the orientation and fuse order; this is the only way to check the
wiring, esp if POs have been snipping...
did this when I replaced my(70 9seater) box last fall (careful, if its
ORANGE it breaks like basswood), not as hard as it sounds...
