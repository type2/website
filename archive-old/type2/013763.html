I am still struggling along trying to get this engine ready to go in.
Engine is a carbed 1800, bus is a 74.

Tried to adjust the valves before I put it in but not having much luck.
followed the thread about finding top dead center, thought I had it
right, but when I try to adjust the intake valves, I back the screw all
the way ou and the rocker just pulls all the way down to the valve, cant
get any clearance at all.

How do I know which way to install the distributor?

The books talk about marking your clutch when you remove it to make sure
it goes back on right. What if you are using different clutch, how do you
install it?

Can I use a stock vaccum dizzy with a progressive Weber?

Thanks in advance,
