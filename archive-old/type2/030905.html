I have upgraded to wider lower tires with excellent results for many
years, helps the handling.  
I use  205/70R14  Michelin MXT all season radials

&gt; up to the front of the bus from the engine....to fix the notorious VW
&gt; heater problem....could I insulate this hose somehow?? or would that get
&gt; in the way and damage something?

doubt it could hurt anything, but doubt it would help much either
