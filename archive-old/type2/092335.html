Subject: Looking for Rear Hatch lock part

Well I finally figured out why my rear hatch lock isn't working
correctly.

After I cleaned up the greasy mess I found that a EPO had filled off a
part of the keeper that keeps the outside of the key cylinder from
turning.

Does anyone have an old rear latch that the key cylinder is buggered up
(technical term) and still has the keeper ring.

This doesn't show the actual ring but:

The part I need is part of item 24 and holds 23a in with the assistance
of a circ-clip type retainer.  I don't need a whole new lock just that
one little special formed flat washer.  I couldn't even try to ascii
draw what it looks like.

Thanks for any help y'all can provide.
