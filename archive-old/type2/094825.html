Subject: Re: [T2] Is there a EZ way to clean the tank?



Well there is the Clara way..........Clara is a regular contributer to the 
Vintage list.........

She take a sock and drops in a strong magnet. I would recommend taking apart 
a broken speaker, or better yet a old hard drive for the magnet. Put the 
magnet in the sock, and take a wire hanger and tie off the sock. Drop this 
in the gas tank, and let the end hang out of the filler tube. WHY? You all 
are asking WHY? The magnet will pull the steel bits to it. You take the sock 
out once a week and clean off the steel bits.

Any questions? Reply and I will answer.
Jason
