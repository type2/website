Subject: Replacing heater control cables

All,
Both heater control cables on my wife's 73 Kampmobile are broken.  I  
have excellent replacements (thanks Bus Depot!) but the remains of  
the old cables are apparently frozen/rusted in each &quot;conduit&quot;.  After  
removing what cable pieces I could from one conduit, I've been  
attempting to get the rest out using copious amounts of penetrating  
oil, compressed air, and various lengths of long stiff wire mounted  
in a drill.

I haven't yanked the other one out yet, but it appears to be equally  
frozen.  Before I start this whole scenario over again, does anyone  
have any better suggestions for getting the old cables out?

What, if anything, should I coat the new cables with as they go in so  
this doesn't reoccur?

Thanks
-lilmatt
