&gt; &gt;&gt; I have noticed a few people on the list use these Deep Cycle Marine 
&gt; &gt;&gt; Batteries...Just wondering where one could purchase that type of 
&gt; Thought I'd add $.02 (Canadian, = $.01 US) worth.  Don't use a marine
&gt; battery.  They're made to be discharged to the bottom before charging.  You
&gt; want something that will keep a charge for a long time.

I tend to agree.  I've never had long life from an RV or marine battery in
a camper application.  Two years seems to be about max which, oddly
enough, is the length of the warranty on these expensive beasts.

I went to using standard starting batteries from Pep Boys and usually get
about four years from them.  Do the math:

Deep cycle battery: $120/2yr = $60 per year
Starting battery: $50/4yr = $12.50 per year

Plus, the warranty is better on starting batteries!

The only time I'd recommend a deep cycle battery is if the total capacity
of the battery was an important consideration.  For normal 1-evening
camping, a starting battery is fine.

Plus, you can give yourself a jump from a starting battery, an act which
will destroy a normal deep cycle battery.
