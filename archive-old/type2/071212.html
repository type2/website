&lt;&lt; &gt;I ask all this, because I'm not sure if I should keep it, or try to
&gt;find an earlier bus...say a '71.  Keep it or sell it, I can't lose seeing as
&gt;I got a good price on it... Any comments/advice?

Depends on you and your tastes.  They both have advantages and
disadvantages.  Personally I think the advantages of the type 4 engine
outweigh the disadvantages.  Check the archives for plenty of discussion on

I've got a keeper...thanks for all your help...glad to be part of the list 
again.
