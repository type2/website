Subject: digicam deal at Staples

Since it's Fri, thought I'd tell you bussers about a deal at Staples-
the highly rated Olympus 450Z digital camera is $470 with a $99 Floppy
disk drive Olympus card reader thrown in for free.   Very natural feel
and layout for those used to regular 35mm cameras.  The 3x optical Zoom
allows us to use it for a business expense, for it will shoot through a
microscope just fine.  Plan to use it to to keep records of engine
dismantling, campouts, and shows.  See more and more of these things at
bus getogethers.
     Healthy, Happy, Holidays to all!
