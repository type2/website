Subject: Re: [T2]  hydraulic lifters or solid?

&gt;a little &quot;trick&quot; that might help without any disassembly.....take off the
&gt;valve covers and push down on the pushrod side of the rocker arm.  a
&gt;hydraulic should have some give, the solid will be &quot;solid&quot;.

I think you will only feel the 'give' if the cylinder in question is at TDC.



&gt;&gt; rebuilt more than once supposedly.  #2 What rust breaking oils/lubricants
&gt;&gt; are you using.  All I ever use is WD-40.  You can pmail me if anyone has
&gt;&gt; some amazing stuff their using, I'm not looking to start some sort of debate
&gt;
&gt;yeah I would love to find something that &quot;really&quot; works


A torch and a lot of fancy language is the next step after penetrating
oils.  After that comes a drill and a tap.
