Subject: Starting a road trip, need advice

Ok folks

here's the scoop. I need to outfit my bus to work as a mobile office. I work
as a photographer doing concert photo's mainly and want to spend the summer
covering as many festivals as my four wheels can get me to.

Right not I have a non pop top bus with a sunroof. It's a 78 and is
outfitted with a sink/stove bed and fairly decent karma.

I'd like to set it up so that I can use the front seat area as a desk and
keep the back for sleep/eat.

Here's one question, I need a computer and don't have a decent laptop. Could
I run a desktop off a inverter or is that just completely nuts. I would have
to get an LCD monitor which is fairly low power. If I had anything of a
budget I'd just get a balls to the walls dell 8600 but that's not an option
at the moment. Also has someone had experience using a spring pcs phone as a
wireless modem?

Thanks and any input is welcome. I'm probably going to be updating as the
summer progresses at my bus website. http://anyathebus.tripod_dot_com
