&gt; here. No matter what I do, my 2.0 litre 77 bus will NOT run when timed
&gt; correctly.  I have verified my timing mark using three methods.  The bus
&gt; runs well with an occasional miss if timed about 28 before tdc. As I
&gt; approach the spec of 7.5 btdc, even adjusting the idle screw will not keep
&gt; it from dying.
&gt; 1.  What could cause this condition on a 15000 mile eng with new bosch
&gt; you-name-it's(everything)?

. timing gear on dizzy off
. vacuum advance stuck
. timing mark on pulley off

&gt; 2. Why would the bus run so well at 28 btdc? And would it be terrible to run
&gt; as such since it only runs decent there?  I have never run hot and don't
&gt; want to now.

spark plug wires on wrong terminals of dizzy

check the TDC with the timing marks.
   pencil through the #1 spark plug hole,  turn til piston is at TDC
verify that the timing mark is at TDC
verify that rotor is set at plug #1 
verify that spark plug wires are on the right positions on dizzy cap

...

also using timing light with it set at 28btcd does the timing advance from
there when you rev up??

this should give you some simple checks.  I suspect that is where you will
find your problme
