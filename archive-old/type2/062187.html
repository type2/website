Subject: Poptop Restoration

Well gang, last night I found a very solid and straight '72 Westfalia 
parked behind the local VW shop.  Westy guys/gals please read!!  My 
questions are at the bottom.

Good Points
~~~~~~~~~~~
  o Body is in great condition!  Minimal surface rust, no rot or holes, 
    small dent in nose.
  o Frame is solid
  o Floors are solid and clean

Bad Points
~~~~~~~~~~
  o No Engine
  o No Transaxle
  o No Camping Interior
  o Poptop needs new canvas and seals and is very dirty (black grunge on the 
    outside)
  
The Bad Points are not really bad points, each one of the bad points 
listed could be good points.  Good points meaning it gives me the freedom 
to make my own choices about what powertrain and camping setup I want in 
the Bus.

Questions:
~~~~~~~~~~
How hard is it to do a restoration on the poptop?  Replacing the seals 
and canvas tent?  This one needs both.

Anyone ever use the seals and/or replacement canvas poptop tent from 
California Import Parts?  They list a replacement canvas poptop tent for 
$250.00, is it any good?

How hard is it going to be to find a complete Westy interior?  If I can't 
find a Westy interior, I have been toying with the idea of 
designing/building my own camping setup.  Good idea, bad idea, anyone 
have any tips?

Thanks again, as always.  I really want a poptop so bad, someone buy my 
Safare hardtop!! ;-)
