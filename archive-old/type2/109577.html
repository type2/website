Subject: 2L dual carb to FI

Can some one tell me the differences between dual carb motors and FI besides
the obvious?
I'm getting a spare motor &amp; GB that is FI (out of a '75 kombi) that I was
hoping to make a spare for my bus, '77 dual carb.
What I'm wondering is how hard it is to make it dual carb?
I know the obvious things that are different such as inlet, air cleaner,
fuel tank, 'computer', high pressure fuel pump + regulator.
Any other differences I should be aware of? Are the manual GB's the same,
starter, case, heads, distributor, alternator etc?
Thanks,
Richard
