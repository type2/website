possibility you have the wrong dipstick and are overfilling??
try checking the oil then reversing the bus 180degrees and check again.
to see if the bus is maybe leaning one side or the other or maybe nose
down and your getting too much oil


grabbing at straws here

good luck I hate these mystery glitches

Bob

 

nope bob i am whatta you call a paranoid oil checker.

always have been. i wil check the bus oil at every stop usually its just one of my routines before i get in the bus and start it up,and will check it twice in the same check to make sure it didnt read diffrent one from the other time on a oil check.LMAO

my carport is flat and level and i have acquired a certain spot i park her in every time and just keep the spot cleaned up with rag and carb spray works well for the grease not the dark spot formed there LOL...

i fill it to the top fill line as i always have.

i turn the dipstick around in the shoot to see if i can get diffrent readings as well. same reading though.

bob i cant stand these mystery glitches either arg^%&amp;^%^% trying to keep my sense of humore about all of this puking she's doing lately though not getting to discouraged about it so my mind stays clear.LOL

thanks

peace and love

chris
