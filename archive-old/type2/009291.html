Hi all...
     We're off-literally. I'm writing from 30-some-odd-k feet, enroute to 
Los Angeles. As some of you may remember, I bought a 1978 Volkswagen 
Westfalia Deluxe Campmobile in December of last year, with a toasted 
engine. With the assistance of my good friend Darryl Evey (runs Desert 
Autohaus in Victorville CA, drop by and see him if you're in the area and 
need some VW parts), I rebuilt the engine during the Christmas break. 
Darryl finished up putting the engine in the bus, and has been breaking 
it in for me, and now I'm on my way out to CA to drive her home to Texas. 
Joining me on this worthwhile endeavor is my co-worker and fellow lunatic 
Craig McKibben, who thought that a 1400 mile run in a '78 bus was just 
what the doctor ordered for those worktime blues. Crazy, eh? ;-) Start 
was a little rough, we got to Austin's airport at 5pm, with a 5:17 
flight, but we pulled it off, and are on the way. I'm listening to mp3s 
of the Grateful Dead at Red Rocks, 9-6-85, while I write, and Craig's 
alternately futzing with the QuickCam, getting photos of the plane, and 
playing the old StarWars arcade game in MacMAME. Many dead TIE fighter 
pilots... 

     This should prove to be an interesting trip. We're taking a large 
portion of I-40 (aka old Route 66) through AZ and NM, then cutting down 
through Roswell NM and visiting Carlsbad Caverns, before returning across 
the vast wastelands of West Texas and hitting Austin. Additionally, we've 
got the oddball factor going: 2 geeks, 3 Apple Laptops with attendant 
cables and dongles, a Connetix QuickCam, a GPS reciever and attendant map 
software, a '78 VW bus, 4 cds of live Grateful Dead mp3s, all 4 StarWars 
soundtracks in mp3 format, and a plethora of other fun software and 
hardware...  ;-) Being that we have the camera, we will be documenting 
all of this as we go in html, the pages (in fact, one's there now to 
accompany this report) are at &lt;http://www.hintz_dot_org/trip2/&gt;. We'll likely 
be the only type 2 on the road with it's very own local area network. ;-) 
We should be arriving in LA around 8pm, then we'll be driving on out to 
visit with my Grandfater and Mom-she doesn't know I'm coming, thinks I'm 
in Texas, so it should be a cool early Mother's Day present...  ;-) More 
tomorrow from the road...  ;-)


Peace,
