&gt; Is there such thing as a nice SMALL antenna for a CB. I'm interested in
&gt; making my CB permanent when my bus goes back on the road [...] What I'd like to
&gt; have is a small antenna to add to the rear of the pop top
&gt; (permanently mounted) like the late model VW's use (Beetles, Passat,
&gt; Jetta). Those are AM/FM antennas but is it possible to use one for a CB
&gt; without killing the CB's range badly? I use my radio for 'road reports' (CH
&gt; 19) and to communicate with friends when travelling together.

You're asking for a lot here.  Small antenna AND without killing the CB's range.
The more you shorten an antenna the more inefficient it becomes.

Another note, you mentioned mounting it on your pop-top.  If I'm not mistaken,
that is a fiberglass (not grounded) top.  VERY bad for mounting a CB antenna (or
any other antenna).  The antennas need a grounded (car metal) plane to work
against.

You should look for a No Ground Plane Antenna.  Firestick makes some

check out their 19&quot; Designer Roof antenna.  It is under the No Ground Plane
section of their antenna catalog

Personally, I'd go with one of their 5/8 wave NGP antennas, what you loose by
shortening an antenna  wave you gain some in lower angle of radiation with the 5/8
wave.  This will really help out mobile to mobile.

For some technical info about ground plane/no ground plane antennas,  check out
