Subject: Re: Stumbling on low tank? ('72 single carb)

My first suspect would be water in the gas tank. The tank outlet is
actually higher than the bottom of the tank (inside, sticking up aways)
so that water accumulating in the bottom often doesn't get sucked in
until the gas gets low enough to really splash around and mix the water
&amp; gas more. Or unless you get enough water that it gets higher than the
outlet pipe.
