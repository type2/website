Subject: Re: [T2] new engine maint. questions

Cassidy,

Muffler tape(from a local flaps) wrapped around the pipe before you insert 
it.

Be sure and read the instructions and let it warm slowly before running 
full blast. 

A better solution would be a &quot;reverse&quot; pipe knurling device  or &quot;reverse&quot;
muffler pipe expander.  This tool actually makes a pipe a smaller 
diameter.

The only problem is I have never seen one except the one I have and it is 
a custom made job...made from a pipe cutter with a custom machined 
&quot;cutting&quot; wheel.

Cheers, dave

&gt; I am finally driving my bus.  After a 5 year hiatus she is finally on the 
&gt; road again!  I have a rebuilt 71 1600 DP built by Bob, at Boston Engines.  
&gt; She is a beast!  Have done some fairly steep grades at 50 with no pinging, 
&gt; and pedal to spare!  Folks, spend the money when you do a rebuild, believe 
&gt; me, it is well worth it.  Anyway, I have logged 600 miles on her since 
&gt; rebuild.  I have done 2 oil changes since. 1 after initial break in in the 
&gt; driveway, and another time when she hit 500 miles.  Valves have been 
&gt; adjusted once.  First off, can you change oil too much?  I drive my bus very 
&gt; few miles, and mostly around town.  I have the capacity to change it every 
&gt; other week.  I figure I will drive about 200 miles a month, mostly in town.  
&gt; I would like to change it at least once a month.  It may sound anal, but I 
&gt; like to be very meticulous in maintaining my vehicles.  Second,  is it too 
&gt; soon to adjust valves?  This is a newly rebuilt engine, and I would like it 
&gt; to last.  When assembling, I left nothing to chance.  It was either 
&gt; refurbished, or brand new.  Mostly N.O.S.. Also, I have a full Leistritz 
&gt; exhaust. All nos.  For some reason, my damper pipe fits a bit loosely in my 
&gt; muffler flange.  I tried teflon tape, but it disintegrated, and blew out.  
&gt; Anyone else go through this?  Any advice or opinions welcome.               
&gt; thank you,
