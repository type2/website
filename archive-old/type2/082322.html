&lt;&lt; M-B rims look good on bays.   :)

 &gt;&gt;

Yes they do. But they're not 'zactly bolt-on. I had to slightly enlarge the
bolt holes (Steel inserts in the alloy rims) to fit the VW studs. I also 
used a ball grinder to recess the inserts to allow the VW acorn nuts to
sit deeper in the insert. On the back, the M-B rims needed a slight re-
cess (to clear the 10mm bolt heads on the brake drums) and allow the
rims to sit flush to the drums...
