&gt;some sealing compound (which?) to the O-ring and block surface that would

&gt;and withstand coolant? Any suggestions would be welcomed.

J-B Weld works very good on cast iron. I would first hold that plastic
flange on a flat surface and check around the port with a light to veryify
it is flat. They do warp with age.

Also, if the pitting in the cast iron is quite thin, I would grind it a bit
deeper. The J-B weld will hold better if it is not ultra thin.
