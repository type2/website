Subject: Re: [T2] Front Wheel Bearings

&gt; I just replaced the wheel bearings on both my front wheels, and I think I
&gt; may need new spindles.  I noticed a wear pattern on the outer end where the
&gt; outer bearing's inner race appears to have spun on the end of the spindle.

That's not good. Bluing or discoloration means there was a lack of
lubrication and things heated up and you should pay closer attention to them
in future.
  
&gt; First, are these races supposed to stay put or are they supposed to move?

The races are supposed to lock into the hub with a press fit. You usually
need a drift or bearing driver to get both in. Getting them out it should be
tough also. Only the bearings should freely rotate in their grease. You can
understand the design: spindle fixed, races in hub fixed, bearings
contacting two surface allowing rotation in one plane of motion.

&gt; The original races pulled out easily, and the new races went in pretty
&gt; easily.  Second, if they have spun, is there any fix short of replacing the
&gt; entire spindle?

It will never been as good as unworn...

&gt; BTW, now that my front wheels are more solid, I can feel
&gt; the slop that's in the steering linkage.  Oh well, just another thing to add
&gt; to the list...

Funny how it works that way. Once you start fixing it's a long time before
you can stop.
