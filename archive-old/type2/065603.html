Subject: Ball joints, anyone?

Has anyone around here done their ball joints lately? I'm in the process and 
have a coupla questions:

1) Where did you get your ball joints, are they German, how much?

2) Did you replace the torsion arm bushings and bearings? If so, where the 
flying heck did you find the parts? I've read Bob Hoover's sermon on this, 
and he says to use Whitney's urethane bushings. Fine, but my catalog doesn't 
list them for a bus. Nor can I find the stock parts anywhere.

2a) If you didn't replace the torsion arm bushings, how does one tell how 
good/bad they are? What are the consequences of leaving the old ones in if I 
just can't find the part anywhere?

3) What did you use to pop the lower ball joint off? What do you use to pop 
the tie-rod off with?

OK, more than a couple questions, but I gotta know...
