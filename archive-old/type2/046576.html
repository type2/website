Subject: [T2] TRIP REPORT

hey volks,

just got back from my biggest road trip in the bus ever.  I drive a 
1971 westie interior, riviera pop top with a stock 1600 dp.  Longmont 
CO to San Diego CA , thru Jerome AZ for the Jamboree, and back.
My route took me from 12,000 feet above sea level to sea level 
several times.  Temps ranged from a blistering 115 degrees in the AZ 
desert by quartzite to a chilly 26 degrees near trinidad colorado.
The bus did great!  (short version)

LONG VERSION
My bus is basically stock, except  a 009 dizzy.  I have a tired 
motor, 95 in cyclinder number 3, and a leaky main seal. In 
preparation for the trip I had the front end done at a shop, new 
rubber on the front, redid the breaks fore and aft myself, got all my 
electricals in working order (blinkers etc), full tune up, oil change 
and even got the pump above the ice box working! Of course it was 
down to the hour before departure to get done......
Loaded up with my lovely wife, my 15month old daughter,  food, water, 
two weeks of clothes, baby jogger, lawn chairs, two crates of travel 
toys (UFF DA) blankets,pillows, sleeping bags, tent, cooler,
stove, pots and pans, and a 12volt portable swamp cooler.  Not to 
mention tools up the wazoo and a break down kit of all the tune up 
stuff and belt and cables etc.  Whew....
Headed out tuesday night after work right up the mountain.....over 
the continental divide on I70 thru eisenhauer tunnel and down the 
other side to friends in the grand junction area. I went this way to 
force any break downs right off the bat, relatively close to home, in 
familiar surroundings, rather than in the middle of some desert some 
where.  Man what slow going.....All you mountain drivers out there 
will know what I mean. You climb so long, it doesnt appear to be 
uphill any more and you wonder what is wrong with this dang bus?  Why 
am I in 2nd gear when cars are ripping by at 85?
Slow yes, but the bus just kept on chugging along.  By the way I have 
no modified gauges:  no tach, no oil pressure gauge, no head temp and 
no oil temp gauge.  Just the two little unlit dummy lights.
Up the eastern slope and ripped down the western side.  I put my 
limited resources into suspension and brakes for just this reason. If 
the engine crapps out, I won't die, but if the brakes quit or the 
wheel flies off....bad news!
Arrive at our destination 7 hours later.  by normal car it is about a 
5 hour trip so not too bad.
Spend the rest of the night with friends, on the road again around 
noon destination Moab UT then south to friends in Flagstaff AZ. 
Rolling hills, painted desert, beautiful country.  A lot of 45 mph in 
3rd driving.
Camped in the mountains of southern utah wed night, Flagstaff AZ 
thursday night, goofed around Flag friday.  Flagstaff is a great 
town.  Progressive, strong local business, great restaurants, nestled 
in the mountains,  even a disc golf course!
Spend friday night in FLagstaff and up early on Sat to Jerome.  About 
a 1.5 hour drive.  Jerome is a kooky town, dug into the side of a 
mountain.  I haven't been to Europe, but it feels like a village in 
the Alps.  narrow cobblesonte roads, lined with homes and businesses. 
Hanging off the edge of a cliff.  The vw gathering is at the old 
copper mine about a 1/2 mile outside of town.  You need a good 
running vehicle to just make it to the show site.  No Junkers 
allowed!  Only drag is there is not a speck of shade at the show 
site.  Only what you brought.  Lots of folks, more than 100 busses, I 
never took a formal count. The vast majority were those unfortunate 
bussers that are too archaic to enjoy the comforts of a bay window. 
nuff said.  Lots of single and double cabs, only 1 wedgie.  Friendly 
lot.  I don't meet any listers.  Anyone there?
Saturday night was camping at the gathering.  Lots of beer drinking 
and assorted craziness.  I had my hands full with keeping a hat on a 
toddler.  Slow drags were a hoot. Trash can drumming til dawn.  made 
it hard to sleep, but all in good fun.....
Sunday it became apparent that the raffle for the 60 splitty was 
going to get dragged out til 1pm or later, so we gave our raffle 
tickets to a kindly older gentleman who promised to call us if we won 
and hit the road around 10 am.  Further up the mountain and over the 
top and down the other side to prescott AZ, swimming in a lake, down 
the mountain to the baking hades of I10 at quartzite.  I was really 
paranoid that the engine was going to burst like a soap bubble 
climbing grades in a loaded buss in 115degree heat.  all windows 
down, swamp cooler blowing on the baby and stereo turned up.  No 
problems. Crossed into California and towards riverside. South at 
riverside to San Diego.
Made San Diego in the wee hours of monday morning.  Spent a few days 
frolicking in the unusually warm pacific ocean, eating greasy mexican 
food, visiting relatives.  Friday morning head back by the southern 
route, I8 to yuma AZ.  swimming in the colorado river, then north on 
95 to lake havasu, home of the london bridge.

   Stopped at a surprise immigration checkpoint halfway there, and 
upon pulling away, I feel a definite sudden loss of power.  Yikes.  I 
figured #3 finally pooped the bed.  I leave her running and go check 
it out.  After nervously poking around, I see that my oil cleaner 
hose has slowly leaked oil on #2 plug wire and it came apart. 
Luckily I remembered I had a spare, unluckily I had to tear the whole 
bus apart to find it.  I put it where I wouldn;t forget where it was, 
but then I forgot where it was.   No, there was no wacky tobacky 
involved.  My lovely bride found it, I replaced the offending 
ignition wire and off we went.  I love breaking down and being able 
to fix it on the road!  It makes me feel like such a neandereer (or 
whatever Doktor Tim calls himself).
I will say, as one that has had less than pleasant experiences with 
&quot;the Man&quot; in the past, I was pleasantly surprised with the courteous 
offers of help from the border patrol.  They were super friendly and 
checked on me a couple of times.  (prob. looking for me to unload a 
brick of hash while looking for tools.....)
  Camped friday night, swimming in the lake on sat am, on the road 
again by 11am.  Made for Flagstaff again (love that town).  2 hour 
pitstop with friends, then on to Santa Fe NM.  We had a ripping tail 
wind and was able to maintain 65mph most all the way.  Cruize into 
town on fumes to a CLOSED gas station.  Had a undeveloped lot behind, 
so we camped saturday night at the lovely Chevron station. Sunday 
morning we drove north on I25 towards home.  Here is where a blunder 
was made on my part.
Stopped for gas in Trinidad , CO.  I had been struggling against a 
headwind and driving in 3rd gear for a long time.  At the gas 
station, I checked the motor and noticed I was idling fast (maybe 
1500 rpm) and when I pulled the plug wire from either cyl one or two 
there was no change in the motor.  Dead cylinders?  So I gas up and 
pull to the back of the parking lot to investigate further.  So I 
check spark to the plug and it is good, so I pull a spark plug to see 
if it is fouled.  Looked ok, but I put a new one in anyway.  I 
decided to change points and condenser.  I get those swapped out and 
now the bus wont start at all!! Jack with the point gap for an hour. 
I can get it to just barely catch, but dies with much shaking and 
chugging.  After freezing for an hour (26 degrees outside) I give it 
up and call AAA.  A young kid tows me back to his shop so I can get 
out of the wind, knows nothing about VWs,  He squirts starting fluid 
in the cargurator with a lit cigarette in his hand!  I firmly, but 
politley chased him off and finally figured out I had inadvertently 
switch plug wires 1 and 2 on the distributor cap. AAARRRGGGGHHH. 
Switch them back, she starts right up, all four cylinders working 
well.  Kid charges me $40 to &quot;open the shop on a Sunday&quot;, and bills 
AAA $40 for the tow. Blast out of there and pullin to my driveway 6 
hours later.
More than 2000 miles, 6 quarts of oil (leaky main seal) 21mpg avg.

Questions for the list
To cool the engine the quickest do I turn it off, idle or stop and 
give it a fast idle like 2000-3000 rpm?
Is it better to go 50 in 3rd or 50 in 4th if you are floored either 
way? Or should I only go say 40-45 in 3rd to keep the rpms a bit 
lower?
What was up with the two apparently dead cylinders?  was running 
smooth, just fast, and those two plug wires had no effect.

I love my bus!
