Subject: [T2] Re:Starter Recommendation 

Hi Volks,
   In an earlier post,Nick said
     &quot;I have a continuing problem though.  I have a bad hot start problem.  
I have added the hot start relay, and it still happens if I drive for an 
hour or more.&quot;

Well Let me climb up on my soap box while I respond to this problem.  Just 
like everyone else I used to have the dreaded hot start problem.
After getting tired of dealing with it I've found a simple and cheap 
solution.  Once a year I remove my starter to disassemble, clean, inspect 
and service it. At the same time I clean or replace, as needed, all the 
starter and battery wire ends. I also clean the chassis to tranny ground 
strap connections and remove the battery for a good cleaning and servicing.  
Put it all back together and you should be good for another year.
   This way I get to deal with the problem on my own terms.  You know, in my 
own driveway, on a sunny, warm, and dry day.  I firsted started doing this 
on the 77 we used to have and now continue doing it on our 71.    Well I 
hope this helps
