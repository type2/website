Subject: Re: [Re: [T2] Adding and Converting AC Systems]

Scott et al,
Since you guys seem to have some background here, maybe you can answer a
question.

The 71 adventurewagen i have had an AC system in it. The old lines runnin=
g
from the front to the back of the machine are some pretty stout stuff and=

looks to be in great shape.

Would this line work for replacement hose for the brake booster on 71 and=

later busses?

TIA,

Clark Gordon
Morehead, ky.
