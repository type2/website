Subject: Re: [T2] Calif. &amp; Ariz. Emissions Laws - What's the latest?

Ok, I live in North Carolina so I guess I have no
business replying to this thread but I had a question.
about the 30yrs or older exemption. If you have an
exempt 72 bus and you install an engine from a 78, are
you still exempt or will they make you have the smog
and emmissions settup for the 78 bus? Just wondering
incase I ever move to Cali. ;)

Have a great day!
