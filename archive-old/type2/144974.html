Subject: Plug color and mixture - 78 Bus

I pulled the plugs from the bus. These don't have
much mileage on them, but I was surprised to see
the changes in relative color between them.

I am going to do a wideband tune on the bus, but
before I do that I think that the mixture on each
the cylinders should be about the same.

The left spark plug is much darker than the others.
This one is from cylinder #1. I'm thinking I should
replace the injector for that cylinder. Maybe I 
should just replace all 4 injectors, but I have been
trying to avoid spending the $300.

Any suggestions/comments appreciated!

Thanks,
