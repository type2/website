Subject: Re:Magical Self adjusting timing - dizzy problem

     I stripped the points adjustment screw in my distributor last summer.
I was able to retap the hole with the next size up that happened to be not
metric.
 The smallest screw length I could find had a #2 Robertson head!
I wanted to get either a new dizzy or find a replacement plate also because
of the
ground wire breaking off on me twice before.
I found an add on The Samba for a NOS replacement plate part # 311 905 227 c
I just installed this new plate along with a Pertronics ignition yesterday.

The replacement plate came from Johnsbugshop_dot_com for around 25$US.
I think he may have others.

Hope this helps!
