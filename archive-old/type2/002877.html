The good.

'87 GL, auto, PW, PDL, fairly nice grey &quot;weekender&quot; interior with fold out
rear seat (I think one of the front armrests need repairs, maybe some small
tears here and there in headliner or back of seats, but pretty nice all in
all).
Wolfram Grey metallic.  Head gaskets replaced, some hoses at the same time,
runs well, 155, 160, 165, 165 compression.  Exhaust very solid end to end.
New brakes all round (possibly new rotors and drums by PO, I've got to look
to be sure,) auto tranny was replaced once by PO (junk yard markings), a
Good Runner.  To be straightforward the heads were JBed, I think this is an
excellent solution personally, taking it to an extreme approach I bead
blasted them to white metal, did the JB well, lapped all the valves in
again, etc, I've had excellent results with this approach, should be good
for another 75k at least.

90,000 origional miles.  Michelin 205/70 tires on steel wheels, but not
reinforced, it came with them, I think they are fine, probably 15-20k left
on them so next owner can be the judge.

The bad.

A/C compressor removed by PO's mechanic when he took out the engine (which
he left laying in the rear luggage compartment, the engine that is.  So A/C
has been open for some time, I bought some new O-rings and a new drier and
have yet to put it back together.  I will flush it, pull vacuum for a day or
so, reinstall with 134A and see what happens.  No promises there, the ducts
are missing most of their trim sealing strips and the system appears to have
been tinkered with before, possibly by incompetant recall work, or perhaps
it is still recall eligible and the PO did not realize.  Worst case you
might be $400 or so into the A/C to replace things if it doesn't work out.

The body, a lot of small dings here and there and one good crumple to the
rear left corner and bumper, does not affect hatch operation but this isn't
strictly the prettiest van, still no seam rust to speak of and from DC area
all its life so probably not that much salt exposure.

It runs strong, drives well, WV inspected.  This is an excellent &quot;spare&quot; van
for someone wanting to keep miles off their camper, syncro, whatever.  I had
long feared the auto van until I bought my '90 and then decided they are
quite pleasant to drive around town and don't suffer that much mileage wise.
I find them quite useable in the WV terrain, don't really do that much worse
on the mountains than a 4 spd, on the flat they are simply wonderful.

Well I have no idea of NADA, but Kelley says something like $3200 for trade
in value, fair (worst) condition without A/C, I'm guessing that is pretty
laughable as I only paid $5500 for my '90.  I have nowhere near that in it
so I'm asking $2500 quite negotiable.  I want to move all my excess vans so
I'm very open to offers.

Selling all the vans, I have a hankering to pick up a 4000 Quattro for
winter and have too many projects must concentrate on only one.  I will try
to get some pictures this week up on my old www site.  Any interested
parties please email.
