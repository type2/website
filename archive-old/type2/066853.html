Subject: N.O.S. parts

&gt;        It is believed that Volkswagen set the standard for quality and
&gt;precision both in the production of their cars and spare parts. However
&gt;most would agree that when restoring a vintage Volkswagen the most
&gt;difficult step is finding the best, most original part. Often times we must
&gt;settle for inferior reproductions thus reducing the authenticity of that
&gt;sad little air-cooled VW. Don't you love just spending hours modifying a
&gt;re-chromed/&quot;restored&quot; vent wing to get it to fit? Well, we can't stand it,
&gt;so we decided to hunt down original, German, N.O.S. parts, most commonly
&gt;used in restorations; thus forming our company. However, most original part
&gt;sources have dried up increasing their allure and value. Now after roughly
&gt;8 years of searching we have the parts/resources to offer to the public. We
&gt;discovered steering wheels in South Africa, coco mats in Kenya, electrical
&gt;items in Hong Kong/China, early motor parts in Alaska, interior pieces in
&gt;Spain, Holland, and Austria, brake parts in Germany and America; just to
&gt;name a few.
&gt;
&gt;        True, there are many items not worth replacing N.O.S., such as some
&gt;rubber, screws, stick shifts, sheet metal, the wire mesh filters for 25
&gt;horse power cylinder vent holes, but we have them anyway. So you stripped
&gt;your car, you made a list of what you need, now give N.O.S. a call. We may
&gt;have everything you want that you thought you'd never find - only New Old
&gt;Stock, the only parts we carry!
&gt;
&gt;N.O.S. - German Volkswagen parts, never used, often in un-opened, original
&gt;factory packaging thus ensuring optimum quality, fit, and authenticity.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Here is a list of some of the most popular parts we carry. Please call for
&gt;availability of other parts not on this list!
