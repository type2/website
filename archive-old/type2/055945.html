Subject: discbrakes on pre-67s Qs.

Hello all,

Other than the 68 beam swap for disc brakes, does anyone have any
experience with the aftermarket bolt-on link-pin disc brakes?  Emergency
stops for a yellow light are adventures to say the least.  Someone also
mentioned the lack of handling in heavy crosswinds.  This too scares me
when I'm driving down a two lane highway and a semi comes the other
direction doing 70!  Talk about white knuckles!  With the combination of
the crosswinds and the headwind from the truck I _really_ worry about
being blown off the road! I apologize in advance to the purists, but
does lowering help a bus's handling?  The disc brakes are a &quot;for sure&quot;
mod and I'm still on the fence about lowering.  Safety first, cool
looking second.
