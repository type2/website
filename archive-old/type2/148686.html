Subject: Dixie Bus Gathering

For those wondering, Dixie this year will be a back to basic campout. Good
friends meeting in a field and hanging out. As everyone else, I seem to be
way too dang busy to plan and prepare allot of activities.  There may be a
50/50 if I can motivate someone to scour the campground and hawk tickets.
There may be a door prize or two if any arrive.
At this point I will be doing good if I can find a weekend to cut some
firewood (some dang fool likes to burn a few cords I hear) and getting
enough chili fixins to feed ya'll.

I do expect a breakfast burrito on Sat am, prior to the cara bus over to the
show if anyone wants to visit the show this year.

Bring your musical instruments so you can entertain our guests by the fire.

I just wanted to set accurate expectations.

Again the dates are Aug 11-14

If you are on any other list than OVT or type2, please feel free to pass
this on.  I have done zero promoting this year.

Someone could send this to FMBC for me, that would be great.

Cya soon

Make it a Great Day!!
