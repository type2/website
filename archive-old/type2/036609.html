&lt;&lt; List Members,
     Are JC whitney's three point seatbelts still the best bet for new
 three point retractable seatbelts (in a 70 bus)?  Thank you all for you
 input.

I bought 10 sets of Mexican Bus belts over a year ago and quickly sold out.  
When I tried to order more, they told me they were no longer available.

I saw in a recent issue of Hot VWs that someone was selling retractable belts 
for the bus.  I can't remember who, but possibly it was Wolfsburg West.
