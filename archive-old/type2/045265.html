My vote is late standard westy yellow ('76-'78?) which is NOT the same
color as the '74ish chrome yellow though the chits (PPG for sure) sometimes
list it as that.  On the paint code tag (code I don't recall) the '77 says
Maragleib
which I interpret (with no basis whatsoever except it looks it) as Marigold.
Unless Mara means chrome.

Anyway '77 standard westy, it don't get no more school busish.
