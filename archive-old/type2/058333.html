&gt; 
&gt; My question is:  how can we treat the fiberglass roof so that it
&gt; becomes water-repellant in the same way that turtle wax makes the
&gt; paint water-repellant? 
&gt; 
	If you are really serious, you could &quot;Gel Coat&quot; it. Gel Coat is the
final shiny outside
	layer on fiberglass surfaces such as boat hulls. You can repair the
gel coat, or add it
	to your fiberglass top. Note the process not trivial in that it
involves cleaning, sanding
	and then applying the coating which is a two part fiberglass resin.
Pigments can be added, 
	or pre-pigmented resin is available. See library for books on boat
repair, or a good retail plastics
	supplier (Yellow Pages &quot;Plastic..&quot;) or a marine supply house should
be able to explain to you in
	fair detail how to use thier products.

	Getting a large flawless mirror finish surface is difficult, but a
reasonable surface is possible,
	and major flaws can be sanded, and polished out.
