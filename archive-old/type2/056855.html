Subject: Re: high heat

&gt;  I almost wish I'd followed the advice of the mechanic a couple of weeks
&gt;ago who told a bus owner they's be happier not knowing the temp.

That's the 'unsmartest', un-mechanic's advice I've heard in a looong 
time. Reminds me of people who don't keep track of the balance of their 
checking account. I never really understood why they called those lights 
idiot lights but now I'm starting to understand! Seriously, Oly, how in 
the world could any well thinking, halfway intelligent person be happier 
not knowing what goes on behind the hatch? I'll tell you, I feel a lot 
better when I know I have only $00.04 in the bank than when I think, 
hope, pray I have another $300 in there but really haven't a clue and 
might be overdrawn $600.

My advice: First, learn to relax; worrying is going to get you nowhere 
except in the hospital. Like a brand new mother/father, you're listening 
for every sign from your child to find out if it's sick. You'll only know 
when it happens. Second, make sure your clock is telling you the truth. 
Third, as said before, you don't know what goes on until it happens. A 
few years back I burned a hole in a head after 3 trips up and down Menlo 
Park to Donner Pass, (8000ft) here in CA. Nobody can tell me why or even 
how it happened; only make (wild) guesses. Had I had a clock at that time 
I would have known for sure something was drastically wrong and have 
stopped long before anything disastrous was about to happen; that's all! 
As it went, I kept on going which cost me $600. And what did your VDO 
meter cost you?

Relax and enjoy your trip.

&gt;I installed the VDO oil temp guage and used the dipstick sender.  as I
&gt;understand the previous postings, the dipstick should run a higher reading
&gt;due to location..  I had my 1600dp up to 280-290 on the guage in 90 degree
&gt;temps last week.  I'm using Mobil 10W30, have less than 10k on the motor and
&gt;have retarded the timing as much as I can.  Tomorrow morning I'm gonna
&gt;tighten every exhaust connection I can reach since it's been getting louder
&gt;over the last few weeks.
