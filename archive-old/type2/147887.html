Subject: Re: Stuck locks

 &gt;Have found a 76 bus that has been sitting outside since 86.   All locks not
 &gt;operable.  Have been using WD40 for last 4 days.  No go.  What now?

 &gt;Ginny in Winnipeg

Can you get into the bus through any of the doors? If so, it is an easy job 
to take the door skin off the front doors and unscrew the door handles from 
inside the door and hence get the handles out complete with locks. You can 
then get the lock barrels out of the handles - make sure you have the key 
in the lock before you do this or the little metal wafers and springs will 
attempt to escape!

Cheers,

Martin.
