&gt; Just before I drove back to Everybus I installed a 1986 Vanagon drivers seat

&gt; to a bus! All I had to do was to pound down the &quot;inner&quot; seat rails on my bus

I did this to my 78 a couple years ago, and I have to agree it is the best
single thing I did for comfort in my bus,  since mine is a deluxe I had
the air duct on the door but I just removed the door side armrest,  since
it was a later bus it just slid right in.  anyone who hasn't really should
at least give it a try
