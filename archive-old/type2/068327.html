Subject: ID My '68 Bus.....Please...?

Hi out there in VeeDub land...

Anyone who's been reading my messages will know that I am having
problems finding the wiring diagrams for my early '68 Bus.  I've written
to VW for details, but think this may take some time.

I wonder if anyone out there can help me to ID my bus, whose details are
as follows;

VIN                   : 228084614
Orig. Engine Number   : 0060661
Current Engine Number : AN000317
First Reg. in UK      : 5 April 1968

I'd like (obviously) to get as much info. as possible.  I am pretty sure
that it's a '68 bus, but Bentley and Muir are confusing me.  I think
from Muir that it was built in December '67 - which would make it a '67
bus...no?

If you can, then please do help me!

Thanks folks,

Jonathan.
