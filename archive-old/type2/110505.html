&gt; &gt;Good point.  How do the heat riser tubes seal to the center section?
&gt; &gt;Since there is exhaust going through that tube I want to keep in inside!

&gt; Aren't they just brazed?  Can't you have it re-braze welded?

On the dual port center section, the heat riser and the manifold center is
buried in an aluminum (I think) casting.  Not all that repairable.  Even
if it were a matter of rebrazing the tube it would be really hard to
get everything to line up without a very good jig.

The heat riser design is one place that Porsche really messed up.  If I
were designing it these days I'd put an electric heater muff around the
manifold with a thermostat to regulate the temperature.  Electrics were a
lot less capable back in '38, of course.

Makes that Megasquirt seem a lot more attractive, doesn't it!  :)
