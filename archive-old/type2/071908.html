Subject: Help!! I've got 34PDSIT blues
Message-Id: &lt;l03020900b361fbfab4ae_at_[130.159.236.35]&gt;

I am trying (and failing) to get my twin 34PDSIT carbs set up properly.
Anybody out there good at it? Please give me some help.
I have taken the carbs off, cleaned them up, set up the throttle and choke
flaps as per Haynes and put the carbs back on the engine.
I've set the timing to 4 deg ATDC with the vaccum pipes on and replaced all
the ruber manifold pipes.
It still runs like a 3 legged dog.
PS  Compressions are all around 100/115
