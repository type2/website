&gt; 2) What is the best way to haul a 16' canoe on the top of this pig?  ive been told both the little foam blocks as well as the yakima racks?  Any opinions?  We intend to pack the luggage rack w/ gas cans, etc... so i don't think the blocks will cut it.

Don't know about the rest, but this I can answer.  Parts List:

2 - 2x4's
1  - set of Quick-n-Easy Roof Rack Brackets (~$50) http://www.noc_dot_com/ss/pp/racksys.html
(optional) carpet scraps for padding

Use the Q-n-E brackets to mount to the rain gutters.  The 2x4's are the crossbars.  I needed to add small pieces of 2x4 under the crossbar to clear the westy roof.  This necessitated longer 3/8&quot; bolts.  I used stanless bolts with nyloc nuts.  Also, the 10-24 screw threads in the brackets needed cleaning up a bit. With a westy (or other camper top) one must be removed to raise the pop-top.  I mount the brackets backwards so the bracket turns out away from the bus (you'll understand when you
see them) to clear the pop-top. Then I took a hacksaw and belt sander and trimmed down the lock tab so the pop-top doesn't interfere. Before cutting 2x4's to length, look at the Yakima &quot;overloader&quot; bars (?).  I extened the front crossbar (or 2x4) so that it sticks out about 18&quot; past the driver's side of my bus.  Makes it much easier to load and unload by myself.  I can slide the canoe to that side, put the stern on the ground with the bow still on the front rack, and stand up under the
portage yoke.  Pick up the canoe, back up a little and walk away.  Loading is the reverse of this procedure:-).  I leave the rear rack on all the time and only put the front one on when I need to carry the canoe.  It's pretty quick.  Just loosen the clamps a little bit and it comes right off.  As for tying the canoe down, I use old climbing rope to attach it to the crossbars.  It stretches a little so won't work loose 5 miles down the road.  I also put a small line from the bow to the front
tow hook under the bumper, just in case:-).

I've hauled my cedar canoe and as many as 3 canoes with this setup for several hundred miles with nary a problem.

Good Luck
