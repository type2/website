&gt; I finally got the pushrod tubes in and now it's the rocker arms.  I
&gt; backed off all the adjusting screws, however it seems that some valves
&gt; are being opened no matter how bar you back them off.  This makes
sense
&gt; to me, as I don't expect enough adjustment that even a fully opened
valve
&gt; could be closed by backing off the adjuster - it's just that none of
the
&gt; manuals mention it leaving me second guessing myself (again)  Can
&gt; someone just confirm if this is normal?

It's normal!

Feel better now? :)
