Subject: Re: [T2] Windshield washer

Hiya Richard,

&quot;Reaching up in there in a PITA. There are only 6 nuts holding the upper part 
of the dash on. I'm not 100% about the 1970 dash ....................&quot;

No kidding.  It's a royal PITA.  In the 1970 dash too.  It's just that all he 
really needs to do is to get rid of the sprayer.  And if he busts it up 
getting it out there is no big loss.  I'm thinking that this might be the time to 
go the &quot;quick and dirty&quot; route.
