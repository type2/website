Subject: rumor mill

Hey VeeDubbers,
I got another rumor i want to have debunked. Thanks to Jim Hood for 
dispelling the last one, in which a neighbor told me &quot;a car battery set on 
concrete will lose its charge quickly.&quot; NOT TRUE says Jim.
The other one I had, notably from the same neighbor, is that &quot;the wire 
around your pushrod tubes (retaining wire) doesn't need to be there, just 
throw it away when you take off the valve covers.&quot;
Uh, i have seen a number of busses without this wire, probably because it is 
a pain to get in right, but are folks without this wire headed towards some 
kind of disaster?
Okay, also, if anyone else has VW oldwive's tales, lets discuss 'em...
