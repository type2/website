Subject: Re: [T2] Used Rotor question

&gt;From: Richard Atwell

&gt;I remember someone saying that NAPA had good prices for performing this 
&gt;work. I've found that the cost of having them turned to be expensive and 
&gt;you might as well put the money towards new rotors.

I had some turned at a local NAPA about two years ago. IT was like $12 a 
piece. I felt it was a just and fair price.
