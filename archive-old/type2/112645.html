When I first bought this CD I too figured that it might be a pirated copy of what the VW parts department uses. But I have continued to see it for sale on eBay with newer versions coming out every
year. I think that as paranoid as VWofA has been the last couple years about enforcement of their products they would have cracked down on this a long time ago if they were bootleg. The one I got
has an official looking case with VW and Audi logos on it.

What disappointed me about it is that many of the part numbers and descriptions for older VWs are flat out missing. The only benefit to owning this is that whatever is listed in there you have a
good chance of it being still available through the dealership.
