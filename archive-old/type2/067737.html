I'm afraid I disagree with Fig here...

Definitly on a 'loaf' the steering wheel comes of and is on splines so can be
moved. I've had mine off several times.

Don't know about splittis though.

An aternative which would work on a loaf, and possibly on a splittie if the 
parts are the same, is as follows...

The bottom of the inner steering column (the part that actualy turns) is 
connected to two corners of a rubber square. The other two corners are connected
to a flange which is clamped to the steering box shaft. If the clamp is loosened
then the wheel, inner column, rubber square and clamp may be turned together and
reclamped in the desired/correct position.
