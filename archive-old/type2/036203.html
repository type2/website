Subject: Road Trip Help (Houston to Wisconsin)

My cousin and I are departing Houston on Tuesday to drive to Chicago 
and Wisconsin.

We are delivering a car to a friend of a friend sort of thing, and in 
the process, we're hoping to pick up a &quot;70 Westy in Belvedere, 
Illinois, and definitely picking up my &quot;new&quot; 63 Notch in Wisconsin for 
our return leg transportation.

We will drive the Westy (hopefully) and the Notch (definitely) back to 
Houston during week of Feb.21.

Since I guess we might have two oldy newbies to worry about as far as 
making the trip home,
I wonder ................
Anyone on the way between Chicago and Houston out there that might be 
so kind as to offer up their appropriate emergency contact info to me 
so that I might be able to get hold of &quot;somebody&quot; along the route in 
case I need suggestions for reliable VW repair shops within a 
reasonable vicinity of the trip.

I have Triple A Plus, so I can get towed all OK should it come to that, 
but I will need to be able to get hold of &quot;somebody&quot; out there that can 
offer my cousin and I good suggestions on where to tow to.

I promise to not &quot;bug&quot; anyone for more than just info, but it would be 
nice to have a small knowledge of reliable VW repair shop &quot;safe houses&quot; 
located within 200 miles of wherever we might be at any given moment.
