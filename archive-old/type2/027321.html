Subject: Tranny swap needs?

Hi all. I'm pulling a tranny from an wearly 70 bus and putting it into my 
late 69.

I've been driving the 70 and the tranny checks out fine operationally, But 
since I'm doing the swap I was wondering if there are any external parts I 
should replace while I'm doing it.

Would new repop mounts be better than keeping the originals of they aren't 
worn?

Shift rod bushing?

Basically, I am doing the swap on the weekend and I want to go buy parts on 
Friday so I have them if I need them.

I can get under the bus first to check for wear, if that's possible.
