&gt;This will work, and will save the switch, but the voltage delivered to the

&gt;I've found that the VW fuses are another weak link in the electrics.  The

OK, this is what I've learned so far and it will be my first electrical project for the bus:

- run two separate wires from the starter to the relays.

What gauge of wire?

- fuse the lines separately

What style or fuse and what rating?

Lastly, who sells the relays I should be using and what are they rated at?
