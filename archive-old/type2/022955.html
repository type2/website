JC Whitney sells these if you can't find one off the list. They are under 
$20 for standard lap belts, under $50 if you want it to be retractable.

I just got retractable lap and shoulder ones  for my front seats that I 
like a lot more than the fixed length ones I had. Installation was a snap. 
I paid about $100 a piece.

You should be aware that part of a seat belts normal operation is to 
stretch a bit so as not to crack your hips or a rib in an accident. I 
replaced my front belts because they had no stretch left in them. I feel a 
bit safer now, though I know in a front collision I will most likely loose 
my legs.
