Subject: fuel injection, 77 bus.

Dear fuel injected buspeople,
  Once again I'm troubleshooting Karen's bus from hell. The current 
suspect is the intake air sensor. I was wondering if you could help 
me make sense of this sentence in the Bentley manual, p.10-16: &quot;To 
check the potentiometer, connect an ohmmeter to terminals 6 and 9 of 
the intake air sensor. The resistance should be 100 to 300 ohms on 76 
and later cars. &quot; Does this mean I should get a constant reading of 
anywhere between 100 and 300 ohms, or does it mean I should get a 
variable reading covering the range between 100 and 300 ohms, 
depending on the position of the potentiometer? I'm asking 'cause I 
get a constant reading of 300 ohms. Any opinions on that out there???
  Thanks much,
                                 Gregor
