&gt; 78 auto tranny two liter, stock.
&gt;
&gt; have been fighting with a bad head for over two months now, finally
&gt; arrived last thursday and got everything back together today..  cyl #1
&gt; can't get more than 30psi no matter how I set the valves, and this was one
&gt; of the &quot;good&quot; cyl before I started it had a solid 125psi before it was
&gt; #3&amp;4 that were bad, I just put a pair of heads on to keep em uniform..

Any chance you hung up a pushrod on the lip of the follower instead of 
nestled down in the center?  That would certainly keep a valve from closing 
properly.
