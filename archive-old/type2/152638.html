Subject: Slightly OT: Air Compressor Recomendations?

Hello All,
I'm in the market for a quality, decent Air Compressor to do my own body
work and run all the basic air tools. I might want to do some painting,
nothing spectacular, no show quality stuff.
Possibly the tiny tiny bit of sand blasting (just a cheapo harbor tools
sandblaster, no cabinent dealy or anything).
The big limiting factor is it has to be 120v. My house doens't have any more
room on the box and I have no spare 210 outlets.
Somewhat portable is always nice too.
Price is 2nd to quality. I don't have, you know, $1200, but if a $400
compressor is way better than a $300 one, or whatever, I'd spring for the
$400.

Anyone have any suggestions? Even just brands or places to buy or anything?

Thanks for any help!
