Subject: Re: [T2] The Saga of Mario Gavazzi comes to a head?

Hey Mark
 
     That statement was for all the people that are  getting more then 
stupid, but not for anyone else. That was a statement to one  person in a single 
e-mail.
 
Things are still very busy here and I have a great # of good  customers.  I'm 
sorry I can't make them all happy but its a very tough  business.
