Subject: Re: Kindness &amp; Jumpers [Friday]

seeing its friday and all, ill throw in my 2 pennies. 
 although new cars do have fancy computer systems that
can be possibly damaged(not that id know, i just
bought my first car made in the 90's last month
woo-hoo) i think i would rather risk the outside
chance of hurting my car rather than pass by a woman
and her child, or anyone else for that matter stranded
on the side of the road, rather than let them weigh on
my conscience forever.   ive been helped out in need
many times and also passed by, as we all probably
have, and it is certainly a great feeling to be helped
or help someone out.   so if i see you on the side of
the road and you look like you need some help, ill
help you out and even give you a jump in my &quot;new&quot; 93
grand cherokee, computer and all.
have a great weekend all.

&gt; Hey Andy,
&gt; 
&gt;               A relationship got severely strained
&gt; some years back when my
&gt; then-friend took my then-new Jaguar on a shopping
&gt; trip, suffered a flat
&gt; battery, and got a jump from a well-intending
&gt; Samaritan in the parking lot.
&gt; Result:  blown Lucas/Bosch computer... costs to
&gt; repair ran into kilobucks.
&gt; I had earlier, with some pride,  described why the
&gt; Jag's engine room did not
&gt; have the handsome SU carb setup seen on her father's
&gt; 1967 E type.  It's
&gt; scary when your car has more brainpower than you
&gt; do......  That's why I love
&gt; old Volksies -- you can depend on them, if you
&gt; understand them.
&gt; 
&gt; The incident above took place in the mid/late 1980s.
&gt;  I think by now nearly
&gt; everyone is aware that all newer cars have a lot of
&gt; computing power..... and
&gt; most folks know you can blow microcomputers in less
&gt; than a microsecond.
&gt; 
&gt; The Cuban lady you helped may be unaware --  Jumping
&gt; batteries is risky,
&gt; given present-day technology.  Given what we know
&gt; about diseases, you would
&gt; not ask to borrow a toothbrush from a stranger,
&gt; right?
&gt; 
&gt; Good wishes
&gt; Glenn
