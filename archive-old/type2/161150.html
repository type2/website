Subject: Re: [T2] Why is my 77 Westy running so cool???

Not to hijack a thread, but is anyone out there willing to sell a
functioning thermostat for a 78 2.0?  I have about 400 miles on a complete
rebuild but had to leave my flaps open as well since I could not find a
thermostat.  With the weather we're seeing in the Denver area, I'm lucky to
see much of anything register on my oil temp gauge whenever I drive her.
peace,
Troy

&gt; www.ratwell_dot_com has a really good discussion about the flaps. Mine are
&gt; stuck
&gt; open.  Not ideal, but better than stuck closed.
