Subject: 70 bus being parted out

Hello All

The time has come to start stripping the bus.
I have a 70 bus available for parts.  Everything is for sale and to date
only a few things are taken.

let me know what I can sell to you and we'll make a deal

Those of you who replied before I'll be getting back to you tommorrow.
Those e-mails
are at work.

Brent
