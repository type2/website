Subject: Radio block-off plate wanted

Hey all,

I'm looking for a VW radio block-off plate for the dash on my '79 Westy.  I
was thinking of relocating the stereo from the glovebox to the hole in the
dash, but checking it out the dash hole is uncut and original, and the radio
is too big to fit in it without modifying the hole.  I will not do that, so
the radio will continue on in its present inconvenient location.  However, I
would like a block-off plate to mask the gaping hole in my dash :-)

Anybody who wants to part with one, p-mail me with the details.

Thanks!
