Subject: Trade wanted Dellorto carbs

I found a couple for side draft Dellorto carbs I pulled off of an Alfa 
Romeo Alfetta 2.0 (?) when I was in Italy in the service. I think they are 
45's.

I am looking to trade for a pair of 36 or 40 mm Dellorto DRLA's.

Write if you want to trade.

Otherwise MERRY CHRISTMAS everybody!
