Subject: Re: radiused ring compressor

Doktor Tim
I didn't understand until I tried it.. I was always into fitting the rods on 
the crank, then the case halves,,etc.. then the piston. then sliding the 
cylinder over the piston. 

Then I read a bentley,, can't find that book right now..... but it said to 
place the piston in the cylinder ,, on the workbench.
Fit the rods to the crank on the workbench.
Assemble the crankcase and when time to install the pistons...install the 
pistons and the cylinder both as an assembly at the same time. 

It works really slick imho...... either way works for me...
The cutout in the bottom of the T4 cylinders allows this to happen.
You can't do it on a T1 engine..

&gt; Well, getting the rod to slip onto the end cap bolts after case assembly 
&gt; would be trading for a very difficult procedure, particularly with the 
&gt; last piston/cylinder in place. Split ring compressors work just fine and 
&gt; of course allow correct procedure. Verifying rod to crank assembly before 
&gt; case assembly will save you from a lot of extra work. At a minimum, it 
&gt; means at least one extra rod torquing not otherwise necessary. Not a fair 
&gt; trade for an unnecessary non-spec type ring compressor. Just one opinion.

&gt;&gt; Am I missing something? I was just thinking of tapping the piston into 
&gt;&gt; the cylinder from the top before fitting to the engine.
