There is the something similar that seems to work just as good if not better for
me... its called &quot;Vision Blade&quot; and I don't use my wipers either when it rains
because the stuff works so good.  It gives you incredible night visibility in
the rain.  For all you with those original scratched windshields...I think its a
must.  It seems like it fills in those scratches or something...
I haven't tried it on any split buses (their windshields are usually much more
scratched over the years..) but I imagine it would work wonders...



&gt;
&gt; Have you ever tried &quot; RAIN X  &quot; .... I havn't used my wipers in 2 years now!
&gt; It is easy,,, just like waxing your windshield..
