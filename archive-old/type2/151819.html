Subject: Re: [T2] Heated front windshield??

Guys,

My insurance agent puts &quot;glass&quot; insurance on my cars automatically.

Costs about $4-6.00 every 6 months and limits my deductible on glass to 
$100.

The will call out the chip guys to fix rock chips for free.

I have used it once on a non vw &quot;newer&quot; car...Windshield replaced
**and** upgraded for a total of $100.00.....not 100+ tax, but exactly 
$100.00

$6.00 every 6 months even on my new Subaru with the heated front glass...



Think about it.



Cheers, dave

&gt; &lt;&lt;I think that certain Fords and GM cars also had electrically heated

 Yep--and still avaiable in the higher end rides.
 GM for sure--Ford not sure.
 
 BIG DOLLAR&quot;S  to replace.
 
 A guy would live with a small rock mark for a long time.
