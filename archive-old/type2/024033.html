&lt;&lt; The guys name is G. Matthew Bulley, I believe.  I
 know this kind of message is annoying, but the archives left me empty
 handed. TIA &gt;&gt;

this is only my opinion...remember that!!!

it seems that we have become overly apologetic in regards to what is * 
acceptable * conversation on here.  yes there are rules and that is fine.  
but how many times do we have to hear about someone apologizing * for wasting 
the lists bandwidth*??  are you being charged by the *bandwidth* for your 
message??  if it is something important to you that you need info on or have 
an idea for then in my opinion please post it.  i personally wish more people 
would send there answers to the list instead of just the questions.  you may 
not need the advice at this time, but i bet most of you would agree that when 
a new problem arose sometimes you remember a point or two that you had read 
earlier.  i have heard the admin. tell all to keepit to related bus info.  
sounds fine to me....just remember, just cause it doesnt interest you at the 
moment doesnt mean it wont interest 100 other members.  just my opinion....
