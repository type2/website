Subject: or why we do what we do

You know, I have been wondering about this for a long time. Why does it seem 
that old VW owners (or at least those who love them) are more apt to help 
someone who need a hand? Not too sure other than VW's seem to seek out those 
who deserve em. Kind people who would go to the ends of the earth (and well 
into debt) for our cars, and in the meantime help all those who we pass along 
the way. Yeah, we go through life alittle slower...maybe just slow enough to 
see the faces of people. We may sympathize with people who break down, as we 
have been there ourselves, but somehow do WE ever truly feel stranded? We 
have a great community here! Great minds and big hearts.
Ever notice how the VW emblem is all enclosed in a big circle? We are all in 
this together.
Just a bit of Friday ramble!
