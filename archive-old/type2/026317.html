Subject: 7.5 BTDC Aaaaack! Are you nuts?
Message-ID: &lt;C51ED84B6F47D211917A0000F8BCBD1101550100_at_zcard00g_dot_ca.nortel_dot_com&gt;

&gt; &gt; (2) I strobed to 7.5 BTDC because of a sticker on the fan 
&gt; &gt; housing reads this
&gt; &gt; and shows a picture of the flywheel with the middle of three notches
&gt; &gt; arrowed.  
	[Crick, Bill [KAN:0W40-M:EXCH]]  Jim: My God man! Don't set it to
7.5! 
	That is the value that Volkswagon thinks you should set it at.
Everyone knows that they don't
	know anything about air cooled engines. They probably even think
they sent your van with the
	right distributor. 
	You can set it at any other value, and find someone who will tell
you this is the right value.

	You seem to be well along the right track. If you get any seemingly 
	sensible answers to your dwell question from more than one person
	you may want to take the advice. I'd go with the dwell, as it is a
dynamic measurement,
	and worn  machinery is a dynamic situation when running. I had a
bike once that would only
	run with the points set to about 1 thou. Couldn't figure it out.
Turned out the crank bearing was about
	30thou oval. I suspect the dwell was reasonable when it was running
with the points set at 1 thou.
	NOTE: The above is only an opinion. It may not be a fact.

	Sorry! Couldn't help myself. Must be a full moon;-)
