Subject: 2.0 L case splitting advice sought

I'm splitting a junkyard 2.0 L case. All the bolts are out. (Yes, even 
the one behind the flywheel and the deep one near the cams.) Haven't 
started tapping yet.

The case was put together with some permatex. I had a difficult time 
getting the oil pump off; it too was permatexed. Using 2-screwdriver 
method per Wilson, I broke one ear off the pump cover, so now I am 
feeling cautious. (Fortunately, I am replacing oil pump).

I'm looking for advice on where to tap, how to tap.

Thanks.
