Subject: Re: [T2] Rust Bullet in Canada

I to was also going to use the POR-15, but the multi stages and the
seemingly finicky application and topcoating thing was a bit of a turn off,
not to mention the greater expense.  Rust Bullet comes highly regarded on
the Samba site.

I still plan on the POR -15 treatment of my gas tank as per Richard Atwell.

I have been getting great results cleaning carpets, and vinyl  and plastic
parts with a product called Pink Solution.  It is enviromentally friendly,
non-toxic and cheap.

&gt;
&gt; I was going to say &quot;have you tried POR-15&quot;. But in surfing the rust bullet
&gt; site it seems to be better.  Except for me, I do not want to do a second
&gt; coat a day later.
&gt;
&gt; Very interesting info.. Thanks for turning me on to them.
