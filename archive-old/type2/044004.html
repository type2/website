Subject: [T2] Re: input shaft replacement

You don't have to pull the diff out to swap the input shaft. I had a trans 
last year which I brought back from NY- it had been sitting so long that the 
flywheel and bell housing were corroded together, and the input shaft was 
pitted as well. I pulled the bell housing and everything else looked fine, so 
I simply swapped both the shaft and the bell housing. I don't think that you 
messed up the threads, I think they got boogered up on their own when the 
shaft unscrewed itself and bounced around.
