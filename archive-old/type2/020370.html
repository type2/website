I have a 78 bus, I have changed the front bushing and the cage on the
shifting rod. I can't seam to adjust it to get third and forth gear. It
also wants to go into reverse when I try to shift to second. tried to
adjust like in the Bentley book but no go. If I loosen adjusting plate I
can get third and forth but not with bus moving.

P.S. it's my daily need to give wife the truck back!

P.S.S. Would like to know of good mech. in Orange Co. CA. that I can
trust last jerk tried to bang me on new heads (Deiters in Fullerton Ca.)
when It was a valve adjustment problem (my mistake bad info) doesn't
know what a leak down tester is. Would not accept any other suggestions
on problem (adjusted valves great compression)
