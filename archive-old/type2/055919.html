Subject: Re: question '72 rear axle hub . 

&gt; 
&gt;  This &quot;sub-plate&quot; is listed as the &quot;axle hub&quot; . . .
&gt; 
&gt;  This &quot;hub . . is about six inch dia. . . wheel studs sticking out. .
&gt; big scallop in the circumfrence . .  
&gt; 
&gt;  That &quot;scallop&quot;, is probably a half pound &quot;out of balance&quot; from
&gt; where I stand . . 
&gt; 
&gt;  That's the question . . why the scallop imbalance and is there a 
&gt; position this should be in in relation to some other feature or 
&gt; each other on opposite ends of the drive train . .?
&gt; 
Naw, that scallop is there so you can do a brake job without removing
the hub.  Rotate the hub as needed so you can use the scallop to allow
stubborn brake parts out past the hub.
