&gt; By the way, I think that ASI is still around. I think I've seen ASI
&gt; Vanagons and maybe even some ASI Toyota vans (the earlier ones, not the
&gt; Previas).

I looked at one of their Vanagon conversions in like a '82 or '83
in a local Walmart lot one day, I was amazed at how identical but
slightly different the fiberglass top was (which is what caught my
eye).  Unfortunately the owner never came out.  But it brings me
to something else, the one I saw had I swear, louvered side windows
like a Bus, something I feel on a camper would be preferable.  Any
ideas?
