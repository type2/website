&gt; As for vanagon five speeds?  They are so rare that they may as well be
&gt; rumor only.  Seriously.  I was going to point you to the vanagon
list's
&gt; archive, and tell you to search for &quot;5 speed&quot;...but it appears to be
down.

I thought I would let you know also that the Vanagon 5-speed caries a
HIGH price with its rarity. A friend has a Vanagon with a bad 5-speed,
the cheapest one he can find they want $1500 for (used). I can get
091's for $125-$150 and they are higher geared than the
002's(depending on year,application,ect..)
I will stick with my 4-speed, I've heard the Vanagons 5's are not too
reliable, but Todd Hill could tell you more.
