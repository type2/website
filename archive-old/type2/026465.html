Subject: RE:  sink/ice box : for sale
Date: Fri, 12 Feb 1999 11:11:04 -0600

&gt;just letting you all know i have a sink/ice box combo out of my 72 
&gt;westy that is for sale.has a manuel pump, and works and looks 
&gt;perfect. lethbridge, alberta,canada

Sticking my nose into other people's business again.  Probably get me
flamed, but I gotta say it anyway:  

If at all possible, keep the damned thing.  Put it in an attic.  Use it as
an end table in your house.  Whatever.  But keep it.  

Even though you may find it useless, if you ever sell you Westy, a potential
buyer might not buy because of lack of original equipment.  And who knows?
You might change your mind in a few years and spend 4 times as much money
trying to replace it.  Original condition campers are getting harder and
harder to find.

Just my unsolicited 2 cents.
