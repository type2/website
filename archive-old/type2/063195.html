        Gregor,
        You've got disc brakes on that '73, use 'High Temperature
Disc Brake' wheel bearing grease, not the cheap stuff and NOT the
super-heavy-duty stuff made for cooler-running CVs.

        Jonathan,
        Yep, if you can jump start it, it isn't a starter problem.
Solenoid wiring?

        All, but especially Jonathan,
        Three approaches to spiders &amp; webs on recently acquired 
busses or busses which have sat for a long time.

        1) Scare 'em off. Very polite considering #2 or #3.
        2) High pressure water wash. Garden hose or coin-op.
        3) Chemical warfare: Aerosol Brake Cleaner. Aim to saturate
        the underside of their abdomen, where their lungbooks are. 
        It'll slow them down in a few seconds, and seems to last
        about 30-45 sec. Don't be mean and 'experiment' once
        you've sprayed, just kill them quickly.
        I use this for black-widows, which seem to like my garage. :(
        I suppose WD-40 or any other petrochemical spray would
        work equally as well.
        Possibly a light alcohol in a pump-spray bottle would work too.

        Doing this on a bus you're just looking at would certainly
        require the owner's permission, or at least should leave no
        residue.

        Bill
