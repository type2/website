Whatever happened to the flag idea? I would carry one, if everyone else
would too.

&gt; Grrlfren', you are gonna get these guys ORganized!
&gt;
&gt; The AIRS t-shirt is how I found George Lyle at Havasu. He was wearing
&gt; one, so I figured he was one of ours -- &quot;I'm Nikki, who the hell are
&gt; you?&quot;
&gt;
&gt; I think a big laminated button, something like 2.5&quot;d with the AIRS bus
&gt; on it would be really cool, and it could serve as decoration in the
off-season.
&gt;
&gt; I know we're getting into Friday territory here, but that's my .02 worth.

&gt; &gt; some of you while staring you straight in the eye! Maybe we could just
do
&gt; &gt; some kind of highly recognizable logo (like the line drawing of the bus
on
&gt; &gt; the Type 2 web site) and use that instead of plastering our names to our
&gt; &gt; chests...sort of like a brotherhood/sisterhood high sign...&quot;Oh! You're
on
