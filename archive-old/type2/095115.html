Subject: re: wife and I cruising america quit our jobs ? a place to stay?!!!!!!!!!!

My wife and I (Julie and TJ) are traveling for a bit!!

We were unable to take our honey moon when we got married 3 years ago 
(because a jerk hit us off of our motorcycle 20 days before we got married) 
so, we have quit our jobs and are traveling (tj is going to finish a 
graduate degree in philosophy at the end of June, 2002!!!

we are starting in Charlotte, NC on July 15th, 2002 and traveling north 
hopefully all the way to New Foundland and then we will head west through 
the states.

We need to know what will be the best to see and we need places to stay (so 
we don't ruin our budget).

we are mid 20's -- quiet and are excited to meet new people and more of 
America -- and grapple with more and new ideas!!!

I am going to try to log our trip on a website I have reserved as 
discontnenment_dot_com

we will be in our 74 westy fully self contained minus a toilet and 
shower?????!!!!!

ANY suggestions on places to stay, people to meet, things we should do to 
our bus (we are neophites -- so nothing is too basic), things we should take 
with us!!

thanks so much for all of your ideas!!!

Julie and TJ
