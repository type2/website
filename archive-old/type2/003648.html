Subject: Re: [T2] trying to do my rear brakes and need help!

&gt; Hello listees, I am trying to replace my rear brake shoes and so far am
&gt; getting nowhwere.  I cannot even losen my lug nuts!  I have sprayed WD40
&gt; on them and this stuff called PB blaster and so far nothing is working.
&gt; I am not a weak woman by any means but I am REALLY trying to loosen
&gt; these damn things and getting very frustrated.  Is there some trick I am
&gt; missing?

What kind of wrench are you using?  If you are using the stock wrench, you
are going to need more leverage.  The stock wrench is fine if the bolts/nuts
have not been overtightened but in your case it's apparently not doing the
trick.

Get a good breaker bar (just a long handle that you can plug a socket into)
and try that, as you will get more leverage.  If that doesn't do it for you,
position the breaker bar on the nut as horizontally as possible so that if
you push down on it the bolt/nut will loosen.  Then stand up on the breaker
bar (support yourself with the rain gutter) and use your whole weight to try
to loosen it.  You may even try bouncing on the bar a little but don't get
carried away.  Just be careful, sometimes they break loose with a snap so be
ready for it.

If that still doesn't do it then it's time to pull out the big guns.  Go to
your hardware store and get a 6-ft length of galvanized pipe that will fit
over the breaker bar handle.  Put the bar on the wheel bolt or nut and then
slip the pipe over the bar.

Here's where the math comes in.  Torque (rotational force) is measured in
ft-lbs.  The easy way to figure out how much torque you are applying is to
take your weight in pounds, and measure out every foot on the cheater pipe,
and mark it with a marker or tape or something.  So let's say you weigh 100
lbs and that you are standing on the cheater pipe at the 1-foot mark, so you
are one foot away from the wheel bolt you are trying to loosen.  Well, 100
lbs. at 1 foot is 100 ft.-lbs. so that's how much torque you are applying.
If you go out to 2 feet, now it is 100 lbs x 2 ft. = 200 ft. lbs.  So you've
doubled the force you are applying just by increasing your leverage by one
foot.

Now if you weigh 200 lbs. then you don't have to go out on the pipe as far
because 200 lbs _at_ 2 ft. is 400 ft.-lbs!

The reason you need to know this is because of the limitations of your
sockets, breaker bar, and wheel bolts or studs.  If you go out too far on
the bar you can break your breaker bar or twist off a wheel stud (which will
then have to be replaced).  So start at 1 foot and work your way out from
there.

The other thing is, a friend of mine told me I need to have a
&gt; special &quot;sping removal&quot; tool otherwise I will not be able to get the
&gt; springs off. Is this true?  Thanks in advance for any help.  Beth and
&gt; &quot;Prudence&quot; the '78 bus in NJ.

Nah.  There are 2 kinds of spring removal tools in the world of drum brakes.
On some kinds of drum brakes there are springs which go through the shoes
and adhere them to the backing plates.  It just so happens that the late VW
Bus drum brakes do not have these springs so you don't need the tool (though
if you did have a vehicle with these kind of brakes, such as a Vanagon, the
tool is WONDERFUL!).  The other kind of springs tie the brake shoes to each
other.  There is a different kind of spring removal tool for these, which
you don't really need as I've found a pair of needle nose pliers will do the
job quite nicely.  Your Bus does have those type of springs.

Good luck!
