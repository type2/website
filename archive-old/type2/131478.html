Subject: Re: [T2] rear main seal

&gt;From: &quot;Rob Henley&quot; There should be an o-ring on the end of the crank (mine 
&gt;was missing) and it
&gt;just slides on the cone.

That O-ring should be replaced with new while you are at it. Your local 
FLAPS should have one the size is 1 3/8&quot; OD and 1 1/8&quot; ID(IIRC).
