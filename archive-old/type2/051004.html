&gt;Gentlepersons-
  &gt;                     Found an excellent station to install those hollow 
&gt;core ignition wires:

You may laugh but I have seen a Mechanic remove a coil wire and replace it
with piece of vacuum hose, then start the car and it ran. Regular Vacuum
hose! The key is that the rubber in the hose had a very high carbon content
or something and it would carry the voltage to the cap. Just one of those
cool Bar tricks, but it does work.
