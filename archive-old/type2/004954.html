Your point is well taken...

I don't recall whether the plug issue was raised earlier in this thread  -
with all the conflicting messages and concerns it's been difficult to keep
my ancient and addled brain focused :-)

So..  Derek...  did you notice a big hole in the rear [rear is rear] of your
carburetor?  Can you see the inside of the carb throat through an opening in
the carb body?  If the answer is yes, you may have solved your problem.

The opening can be repaired with a circle of sheet lead and some sealer  -
some folks have had success using a dime.  I use a piece of lead cut to fit,
then &quot;expand&quot; it in the opening by working around the perimeter of the plug
with a large punch and light hammer taps.  The opening usually has a groove
around the inside, as if a snap ring belonged there, and expanding the lead
plug seats it in this groove and secures and seals it mechanically.  It's
still a good idea to finish up with some sealer, just in case...

By the way, some carbs have a 2nd piece that lives inside - in front of the
circular plug.  It's a small casting, and is shaped so the front [front is
front] side matches the contour of the carb's throat and the back side is
flat.  The engine will run without that piece, but if it's rattling around
loose inside the carb it can be troublesome.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  I don't know who started this thread, but something else that might
cause this 34pict-3
problem is that pesky soft plug falling out.  Maybe someone should write
more about this since at this time there are no archives to refer back to.
