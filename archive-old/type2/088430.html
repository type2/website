Subject: Re: [T2] Re:Re: [T2] Distributor Vacuum Advance(Is this correct)??

[...]

&gt; Ok I went and played with my van on my lunch break. I found that my throttle
&gt; body wasn't returning all the way at idle, but when I pushed it closed there
&gt; was vacum on the retard side of the vacum can and none on the advance side
&gt; so my hoses are correct.
&gt;
&gt; When I move the plate under the rotor counter clockwise, plug either or both
&gt; holes on the vacum can the plate returns to the original position so I think
&gt; this means the can is bad...correct??

Before I would condemn the vacuum unit by this test, I would get a timing
light and check timing at idle. Then remove the vacuum hose on the retard side
and check timing again.
With vacuum on it should be 5 after.
Vacuum off it should go to about 8 before.
Now connect the retard hose to the advance side and check timing again.
Depending on the distributor/vacuum unit you have, it should go to either
16-19 before or 11-15 before.

Since you have a 75, there are 3 different distributors that came originally
on that engine. Depends on transmission and if it is a Calif version. But
there are only 2 different vacuum units.

Non-Calif, manual trans, 022 905 205AB [0 231 181 012]
This has a 07 125 vacuum unit.
Non-Calif, auto trans, 022 905 205AC [0 231 181 014]
This has a 07 127 vacuum unit.
Calif, manul trans, 021 905 205AB [0 231 181 048]
This has a 07 125 vacuum unit.
Calif, auto trans, 021 905 205AC [0 231 181 055]
This has a 07 127 vacuum unit.

The 07 125 vacuum unit will have 995 on the arm near where it attaches to the
plate.
The specs for it is:  8-11deg Adv _at_ 7.9 In. Hg, 11-13deg Ret _at_7.9 In. Hg.
The long Bosch part number for it is: 1 237 121 995

The 07 127 vacuum unit will have 999 on the arm.
The specs for it is: 3-7deg Adv _at_ 6.3 In. Hg, 11-13deg Ret _at_ 8.2 In. Hg.
The long Bosch part number for it is: 1 237 121 999

You really need to call around and get a price for a new one before you decide
to test yours...... and you need to be sitting down:)

&gt; My plan is to replace the vacum can,(maybe points and condenser while I'm in
&gt; there) buy a timing light, make sure the throttle is all the way closed,
&gt; time van to 5 ATDC at idle, enjoy good running van??
&gt;
&gt; Does this sound right?

Almost right..... get the timing light first! Test and verify before you spend
$$$ for something you may not need.
