Subject: RE: [T2] Injector seals

&gt; I used fuel injector seals from Bus Boys for my injectors.
&gt; I was disappointed with the quality

&gt; I ordered seals from Bus Boys and I couldn't tell the difference
&gt; from the ones that I removed

&gt; At www_dot_carmadillo_dot_com, you can see pictures of the seals they sell.
&gt; They have a small and large seals for 57 cents and 66 cents
&gt; each.  They also have Bosch seals for 3.85 and 6.02 each!

&gt; Maybe Ron can explain where these affordable seals come from? At
&gt; these prices they don't seem like Bosch.


The ones I sell are from Continental Rubber of Germany, who is almost
certainly the OEM supplier.  It is highly unlikely that Bosch actually makes
these seals themselves, as they're an electrical manufacturer not a rubber
manufacturer. Most likely they are just reselling the same Continental
seals.  I can't see spending $40 a set (!!!!) for the Bosch name in this
case. Continental is a quality outfit and I've never had a single complaint
about their seals.

My price for the Continental set (part # 311 198 261A) is $4.25 for a full
set of 8 (four large, four small).  This is cheaper than carmadillo's
no-name ones (which may be Continental as well).
