&gt;Anyhow, I  checked Harbor Freight, Pepboys, Autozone, etc.  And guess  what?  The Sears Essentials store near my house had a 3 ton jack  for $59!  It's a bit heavy, but I'm really impressed with  it.

I don't see it on sale now, but often you can get their 3 1/2 ton jack with the wide saddle and 2 stands for $99. The 3 1/2 ton model seems to have been replaced with this 4 ton model: #50156.

The wide saddle is perfect for seating below the torsion bar cover plate.
