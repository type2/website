Subject: Vanagon seat belts in a '76 Westy

I installed those Vanagon belts today.  It was a piece of cake.  The 
only modification of the belts that was necessary was to use a longer 
bolt and a spacer for the top swivel mount so that there is enough 
clearance to swivel.

I documented the project, and you can read about it and see photos here:

Enjoy!
