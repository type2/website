Subject: Re: [T2] Mini-microwave for Westy?

From: &quot;courtney hook&quot; &lt;courtneyhook_at_shaw_dot_ca&gt;

&gt; Has anyone come across a REALLY small microwave for our westies?

Have you tried a van conversion shop?  There's one here locally that
specializes in stuff for vans.  Just about anything that someone would
consider putting into a van.
