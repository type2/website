Subject: Re: Tranny fluid change. any hints on how to?

 Ed said, 

 Hi all; I have a 72 bus and am planning on changing the
 transmission fluid.  Are there any seals around the drain plug
 (like the oil drain) that I need to worry about?

no

  Second, There is only
 one drain and one fill plug.  right?

I would expect two drain plugs, one in front of the other, but i am not so
familiar with the later buses.   One fill plug.

 And finally, what size allen wrench do I need?

17mm.  You can get a wrench, but if you can find the socket that goes on a
ratchet it is easier.    

Set your 1 gallon jug of gear oil in the sun to warm up, so it flows easier.
  Get a pump when you get the gear oil.    remove the fill plug first, then
the drain plug (s), with the bucket  and rags handy of course!    It's best
to do this with the rans warm, ie just after driving.       After it slows to
past a drip, you can put the drain plug back in,  tighten it down firmly,
 and fill the trans with the pump on the gallon jug till it just starts to
come back out.    It'll take most of your gallon.   

A bug tailpipe is a good cheater for loosening those plugs.
