In real estate, it is location, location, location;

in the stock market, it is timing, timing, timing;

in VW air cooled maintenance it is vacuum, vacuum, vacuum!!!

Thanks to H Steven Dolan, we found my problem.  Major vacuum leak.

It was at the gasket on the throttle to the air plenum.  A little Permatex 
on the gasket, and all is well.

After two hours of spinning our wheels (so to speak), I took some starter 
fluid and sprayed around the area.


First of note was the EGR valve, which we sealed off from the air plenum 
with the Permatex.  Then we could clearly identify the throttle gasket as 
the leak. A little Permatex there, and on my arm, and on the VW, and on a 
wide variety of tools  (OK, so I leaned on the open tube of BLACK Permatex 
while I was screwing the throttle back on.  No one's perfect!!) and the 
results are un-be-lieve-able (said in my best Billy Crystal voice)


The vacuum went from 10 to 16!!  And my best ever vacuum was 14.

The VW idles so smoothly, and purrs so nicely I just want to hug it.

And I can, because the '78 Westy DOES NOT heat up anymore.  After a 13 mile 
drive to work this AM, in Northern Virginia I-95 traffic, the fan housing 
was actually COOL.  And I'll bet I could probably have touched the muffler.


The '78 has run super, super hot for the last 4 years.


Now I get great heat from the defroster vents, but  the engine stays cool.  
Go figure.

Thanks for all your good wishes - for reading this far.

PS.  It was funny to see Steve step back 15 feet from the rear of the '78 
when I pulled out this starting fluid spray can, and then later, see him 
actually spraying on the throttle body AFTER we fixed the vacuum leak.  He 
is now also a believer.

Newby's, you heard it before, and I heard it for the last few years, vacuum 
leaks are bad news.  The starter fluid really works!!  I am going back over 
the '78 to check ALL my fitting. Maybe I can get the 16 vacuum up to 18!!

Thanks, Steve.

PPS. The throttle gasket leak developed from my changing the spark plugs so 
often.  I always removed the 'S' tube from the throttle body.     When I 
tightened the 'S' tube bottom clamp, I pushed the Phillips screw driver hard 
against the clamp's screw while I turned the driver, to be sure I got a 
good, tight fitting.  I did not realize that I was also pushing against the 
throttle.  Perhaps this was why I noticed a worsening of running with each 
successive spark  plug change (three in 6 months).
