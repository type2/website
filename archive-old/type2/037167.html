Subject: Left rear window seal

List,

I want to replace the left rear vent/window combo on &quot;Clem. II&quot; with a solid
piece of glass from the right rear of another bus.  Question:  Can a non-vent
rear window seal be used on either side?  Failing that, anyone stock/have a
suitable seal?  Thanks again.
