&gt;I picked up a(just one) Weber 48 IDA, I dont know much about these carbs but
&gt;I hear they are pretty wicked. It is pretty clean , the shafts are tight and
&gt;it doesnt seem gunked up. It has short intake stacks on it but no intake
&gt;manafold. i was wondering the value on these for two reasons
&gt;if I want to aquire another and in case i decide to sell the one I have.
&gt;  Thanks,
&gt;  Bryan

Post it for sale on ebay or any of the Porsche websites. That carb is too 
big for anything but a fully tweeked 911, and I would expect a new ONE 
would cost $1000+. There is no use whatever for an IDA on a  T-II.
