Subject: Re: [T2] Belly pans?

&gt;Are we talkin' about the front &quot;belly pan&quot; that covers the mechanicals
&gt;(pedals, shift, etc.), or the full pan running back to the engine? The
&gt;front pan is universal; the full pan is not.

Sorry, group, I wasn't very clear. I was, in fact, referring to a 
middle/rear pan, and not the one in front, which I do have.
