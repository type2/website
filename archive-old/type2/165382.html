Subject: Re: [T2] Bumper replacement

Hi James,

Your bumper sounds impressive. It sounds like a Jamie Rivers Hitch  
with a beefy bumper added on top.

Me, I think the &quot;Rivers hitch&quot; is the way to go. It's a quality built  
item and it doesn't change the look of the bus at all. The only  
caveat is that it might not work with certain non-stock exhaust  
setups. I don't have one myself, but every single customer that I  
have talked to was happy with it. My dad even bought 2 hitches from  
Jamie for his Vanagon Fleet.

I have also seen a bus where the owner extended the rear bumper about  
12&quot; backwards to create a rear porch; I think it was used to haul a  
motorcycle. I didn't see how it was connected to the bus but it  
looked pretty sturdy and the original bumper was still used.

Just a thought...


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

&gt;
&gt; In my infinite (ly small) wisdom I am making a new rear bumper
&gt;
&gt; 2x4&quot; 1/8th thick rectangular steel bumper with a 2&quot; reciever
&gt; from Princess auto welded to the bottom for the back bumper.
&gt;
&gt; Have all the parts and just need my dad's welder to finish it up.
&gt; Going to paint it with POR15 and then white paint to match it
&gt; up to foxy. Figured what the heck.
&gt; Total cost (in canadian funds): 45$ - tubular steel, 5$ flat steel to
&gt; weld onto ends, 9$ for 2&quot; reciever and a little bit of brown nosing
&gt; to get the welding done pronto... not too bad. And I think
&gt; it will look sharp too.  Safer as well to put 4+ bikes onto.
&gt;
&gt; If interested I can put up a picture later.
