Subject: poor fuel mileage

hello, i have a 74 westy.  Bus originally had 1800cc motor but due to 
#3 connecting rod blowing thru case, had to find an entirely  rebuilt 
engine.  Bus now has with a 2000cc motor with solid lifters,  1800cc 
heads,  modified cam providing extra .025&quot; lift, and a single weber 
progressive carburetor.  Old motor got 18-22 mpg, new motor gets 11mpg. 
  Have done everything I know to try to increase fuel mileage including 
new plugs, wires, points, valve adjustments, and even different size 
carburetor jets.  Bus runs well when warm,  hesitates when cold.  I 
have recently noticed while pressing on brakes, rpms increase.  I 
replaced vacuum hose from intake manifold to brake servo booster and 
did not help.  I believe power brake booster diaphragm to be leaking.  
Would this cause such poor fuel mileage?  or am i missing something?  
Total advance timing is set a 30 degrees.  any help is appreciaed, fuel 
is getting too expensive to filling gas tank every 160 miles!!!   
thanks in advance.
