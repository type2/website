&gt; I'm changing the boots on the axel shafts and I went to my mechanic
friend
&gt; who checked them out.  He let me bead blast all the rust and crap
off, and
&gt; now they look beautiful.  Now I need help to figuring out what is
the best
&gt; paint for them.  Originally the paint was baked on, but I dont have
the
&gt; capability to do this.  Your help and/or advice is appreciated.

1. Mask off the splines.  You don't want paint on the splines!

2. Prime the shafts with suitable primer

3. Paint the shafts with the desired color.  Stock was black, but let
your inhibitions run wild!  Allow the paint to dry.

4. Determine how much your wife/SO likes VWs.

4A. If your wife/SO loves VWs, walk into the kitchen and put the axle
shafts into the oven.  Bake at 250F for an hour or so.

4B. If your wife/SO isn't fond of VWs, consider replacement of
wife/SO.  In the meantime, sneak the axles into the kitchen and place
in oven at 250F for an hour or so while wife/SO is out.  Make sure to
turn on the vent fan!

5. Allow axle shaft to cool and remove from oven.

Done!
