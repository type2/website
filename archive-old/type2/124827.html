Subject: oil cooler leak

re oil cooler leak.

I don't know what kind of engine you have

do you have the oldest 1600 with the 2 seal oil cooler or the
later 1600 with the 4 seal oil cooler with the offset adapter? or
the newer whiz bang type IV

whatever, you must use the correct oil seal, there are really
different ones. The recessed oil seal holes in the engine case are
different outside diameters. The seal you use should fit snugly
into the recessed case hole. The worst type seals are the ones
that look like they were just cut off a rubber tube as a simple
cylinder. The better seals are the two layer deep ones that look
like a donut with a taller tube in the middle ; or a seal with a
higher internal step in the middle.

I always tighten the nuts (evenly) to squash the oil cooler to
touch the case. The later model oil coolers have positional stops
built into them. Do not go by torque alone, start with super clean
threads and nuts that will easily spin all the way down the
threads. Check the position of the oil cooler when finished. Use
Blue, removable strength, locktite on the threads. On TOP of the
first nut down put on an American type split spring lock washer.
Then put a nut on top of this to lock the first nut down. That is
two nuts with a lock washer in between.  I use lock nuts or I
double nut everything I can on a VW engine. It is really important
to double nut the head's exhaust studs to protect them from
corroding away.

There is a guy selling an oil cooler test jig on ebay.

Please let the list know what your final solution is.

thanks

Gary
