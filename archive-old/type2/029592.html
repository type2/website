&gt; Hello Ethan, and others.
&gt; Why did you choose the 30PICT-1 for a 1600 dual port?

Our '69 bug has a 30PICT-1 carb (original) on a dual-port manifold.  It
works great!  Easy to tune, holds its settings well.  I have a 30/31 carb
on the bus, also a dual port, and it works OK when clean, but tends to get
gunked up much easier than the -1.  I wish I could find another 30mm
center section for the manifold, as I'm not all that happy with the
adapter on the bus.  I found the 30mm center section for the bug by just
pure dumb luck while junkyard cruising for the DP parts.  At the time, I
didn't realize that the carb bases were different!

I think that the 30-pict-1 carb was the last of the &quot;no compromises for
smog&quot; designs.  This is probably why they are so easy to work with.  They
lack the complex idle passages that are so sensitive to particles of dirt
and debris.
