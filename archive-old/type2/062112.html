Subject: starting irregularities

I'm still not sure whats going on.  Every time I start the bus
(unless it was running moments before or idle for days), the bus starts but
requires an unusually high number of revolutions before firing.

I'm no pro, but does that not sound like my engine is flooded?

The other suggestion I've heard is that the starter isn't getting enuf
juice and a relay to the solenoid might help out.

If the engine is flooded, how could this happen?  I've been playing with a
spare carb and can't see how it could happen (spare carb doesn't work, btw).

Could the fuel pump be defective?  And pushing gas into the carb to hard?
That _might_ do it.  Its a 34-pic-3.

Any help would be appreciated.

...Markus

ps:  the bus always starts, just not as nicely as I'd like.
