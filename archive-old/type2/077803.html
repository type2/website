&gt; &gt; No, Bob.  The moral of the story is that if you time to the block, not the
&gt; &gt; distributor, it can cause you to severely overheat the engine.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I'll second that.  More than one Type 4 engine has been severely overheated
&gt; because the owner had an 009 distributor and timed it to the specs printed
&gt; for the engine (which originally had a vacuum-advance distributor with a
&gt; completely different advance curve). You must set timing based on the
&gt; distributor that you are using, not to the engine.

I guess I have been doing it wrong  for 30+ years and just been D**n
lucky.   well I have also owned a timing light for almost the whole 30+
years so maybe saved my butt.
   still somehow confused, I had that damnable 009 in my bus when I bought
it and never could get it close to timed right.  but I was and still turn
on timing light, start engine and aim light and make sure the timing marks
are where they belong and that it advances correctly.
    have temp guage and it never gets over 240 on the hottest of days on
the interstate...lately (it's winter) it has been barely reaching 200 on
the interstate at 65mph

certainly I bow down to the knowledge of Steve and Ron, they have more
experience than I ever will on the VW bus.

  now to figure out what dist I actually have (think it is the correct one
for my engine) and compare that with the &quot;real&quot; specs

Mea Culpa to anyone I may have mislead.  although honestly I am still
confused about the way bentley presents it, thank goodness for the list.
