T. Neal has been removed from the list.

Posting blatantly offensive language on this list (even with a * or two 
thrown in) is probably the fastest way to get unsubscribed for good.  This 
is not the high school locker room.

&gt;Hey -
&gt;Ron and the Bus Depot totally ROCKS. There is no other way to describe the
&gt;fact that he provides what so many of us need. For those of you who choose
&gt;to criticize at the drop of a hat, think again. Would you rather drive to
&gt;U-Pull-It or the VW dealership or make that fruitless call to someone who
&gt;claims to have what you need but never does? Anyone who cliams the service
&gt;is bad is the same as someone who sends their Big Mac back because there
&gt;aren't enough pickles. This is a valuable service - not Burger King - and
&gt;it could go away.  Wise the f*ck up. We have a good thing here...
