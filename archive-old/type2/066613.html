Subject: Re: The VW cd

&gt;At the risk of eternal damnation and to incur the wrath of one
&gt;who speaks from on high. Might I very tentativly suggest that
&gt;the number 1 source of info would be 'The Sermons'. At once a
&gt;source of inspiration and encouragement for myself and I suspect
&gt;many others.

        While I too find the Semons of The Most Honorable Reverend Hoover
both enlightening and inspiring, I find many words of wisdom in the gospel
of Bentley. And Sir Hoover (I wonder how hard he's laughing as he reads
this) has mentioned time and again the use of other reference materials.
And while he is very knowedgeable, I don't think he has the resources to
have complete and full technical information on every aircooled VW. An
officially sanctioned CD would-at least in theory. Personally, I veiw Bob
(that is, other than as a friend) as the man who fills in the blanks.
Bentley can give excellent information, and forget to mention something
that Bob can answer from his long experience. In other words, the CD would
be like an encyclopedia, with trival but important things such as part
numbers, model year differences etc. The sermons can answer the questions
left foggy by Bentley. Took me a long time to say that, didn't it...   ;-)

Peace,
