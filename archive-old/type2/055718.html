Subject: RE: horn substitute/replacement

Well said, Clara.  If one drives much on the freeway there's no such thing as 
a &quot;too loud&quot; horn!!!  It's astounding how much difficulty other drivers have 
seeing a Type 2.

I ran an air horn for quite a while, but without a relay and dedicated wiring 
it was not up to full capability and also needed miscellaneous road crud 
cleaned out of the trumpets on a regular basis.

I'm now running a pair of Italian(?) electric horns I bought cheap at a local 
FLAPS.  They're much louder than the stock VW beeper.  I got around the 
grounding problem by mounting them in the stock location using a piece of 
radiator hose material I split and more-or-less flattened.  This insulated 
mounting allows use of the stock wiring with no polarity difficulties, and if 
debris hits the horns the mount will give and prevent/reduce damage.
