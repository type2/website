&gt; Can you guess what might stop me from buying this bus ?

If you had a look at this page you can understand that I suddenly feel very
rich owning my unrestored all original mint condition bus that even has
chrome and other goodies the above mentioned bus did not even have.

Curious ?  ... Have a look at http://www.hrps_dot_demon.nl/jwbus/bus-69.htm

You don't need to ask, its not for sale !! (However you can try to make me
an offer I can't refuse :-)
