Subject: Run Marty, it's the Iraqis...I don't know how they found me!!!

Heh, anyone remember in Back to the Future - Part 1, the Iraqis came after
the Doc because he had stolen plutonium from them? They found him in the
parking lot of JC Penny's and they were chasing after him with a moon-roof
Volkswagen &quot;Bay Window&quot; Bus. The guy was sticking out the top with a rocket
launcher.
