Subject: Re: [T2] procedure to replace front shift rod bushing?

Wow! Now ya got me thinking. I do these about 3X a
year since the wreck! I have never undone the coupler.
I'm thinking either I pull the shift lever or maybe
un-do the front section of the shift rod - there is a
set screw about where the parking brake adjusters are,
about two feet back of the shift lever. You can put
the tranny in 1st or 3rd, then pull that set screw out
and you may have to tap the forward aprt of the rod
off with a hammah, then you need to be careful that
you don't allow the rod to get away from the shift
lever as the little spring-loaded pin is hard to get
back in from below. It would probably be real helpful
to have someone topside to move the shift lever toward
1st/3rd while you use two hands to put the bushing on
and the third one to hold the rod upward so it won't
drop from the lever... OR maybe a long tie strap or a
piece of baling wire, or any of a variety of small
clamps to place up under the rod at the back side of
the housing, just to keep the rod from dropping during
the operation.  I usually buy two bushings and tie one
with a loop of baling wire, to the housing for the
next time. -BaH

 To replace the front shift rod bushing (more like a
 grooved grommet) , 
 is it as simple as putting it in first, removing
 rear cushioned coupling 
 bolt, put it in 2nd to separate the rod from
 coupling, remove coupling, 
 pull rod back enough to replace bushing in front?
