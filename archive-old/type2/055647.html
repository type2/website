Subject: '68 Westy, $2000, Saugus, Cal.

I saw a '68 poptop westy sitting by the side of the road with a For
Sale sign attached.  This is in Saugus, California, about 20 miles
north of LA.

Bus looked pretty good, body straight with what looked like a fair
repaint job (all white).  No visible rust, both bumpers there. 
Interior looked like there were a few parts missing but not too bad. 
No radio and dashboard hole has been enlarged for &quot;modern&quot; radio. 
Good tires, but standard load.  Engine looks good and original,
including smog gizmos.  Non-stock exhaust, but heater boxes are still
there.  Nose pan missing.  Sign said that it &quot;runs good&quot;

Phone number is 805-296-0931

Now you know as much as I do.
