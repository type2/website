&gt;&gt;  I forgot to grease the tranny input shaft splines before putting

&gt;Could you drill a small hole in the side of the bellhousing and squirt

No grease, anti-seize is the ticket here. The hole in the bellhousing deal 
sounds like a good way to end up with grease on the disk. Very bad news. 
Clean and dry will work if the spines are unworn. Biggest problem would be 
if it sits in high humidity sometime and rust gets started. It could then 
get sticky. The anti-seize seals the metal from the air so prevents this 
issue, as well as providing the type of non-migrating lube for free 
movement.  I lube the splines on the shaft and disc then slip them together 
then remove the excess before I assemble the clutch. Thin film on 
everything and nothing left to foul the disk.
