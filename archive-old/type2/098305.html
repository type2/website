Subject: Single Port vs. Dual Port

An earlier post about SP rpm's and mpg reminded
me of a question I have for you folks.  I'm
thinking about a 70 bus with a SP engine.  I've
heard lotsa claims with respect to better mileage
from this engine.  True or not?  Is this due to
the head?  Due to 28/30/31 Carbs?  Due to lower
speed due to less hp?  :)  

I've heard some claim the SP's heads last longer.
 True?  

Any comments and suggestions gladly accepted.

Peace and blessings, 
Nemo, the Busless Captain
