Anton,

The easy way to tell if you have a 1500 or a 1600 built on a 1500 case is
to look at the intake manifold.  If it is a single port (one continuous
piece of pipe that comes up off the 1-3 head, goes over to the 2-4 head
with a &quot;T&quot; in the middle for the carb), then it is probably a 1500.  If
you have a dual port (aluminum casting on the 1-3 head, goes up to a
rubber gasket (aka boot) that connects it to the center tube (carb T's in
here) and over to another gasket and into another aluminum casting down to
the 2-4 head) then it is a 1600 no matter what the code on the block.
Many 1500 cases were rebuilt as 1600's because it was cheeper to get 1600
jugsa and heads than 1500's.  Economies of scale.

&gt; Here comes some newbie stuff...
&gt;
&gt; I'm getting ready to do my first tune-up on my Westy - had the first one
&gt; done by a professional when I first bought the thing, ready to do the
&gt; second one myself. So I open the engine compartment and get out the
&gt; Idiot Book, and start to look at the thing...
&gt;
&gt; I was led by the PO to think that I had a 1600 DP in here. Seemed likely
&gt; - it's a '71 Westy. And the engine certainly looked just like the
&gt; Mexican replacement I had in my ol' '75 Super. Never had a problem with
&gt; that vehicle - first one was the original, and after my sister reduced
&gt; it to a lump of molten metal, the second one came with a set of
&gt; instructions from the folks I bought it from...
&gt;
&gt; So I'm trying to figure out what the timing for the Westy should be, and
&gt; I check the engine number. Guess what? My engine's number is &quot;H&quot;. Just
&gt; H, nothing following. Muir gives &quot;H&quot; numbers for 1500 engines, circa
&gt; 1967... So what do I have here - a rebuilt case from a 1500? Is that why
&gt; the thing is working so danged hard? Man, I feel like an idjut, but why
&gt; the heck would you put a 1500 in a '71 bus?!
&gt;
&gt; Question #2 is, of course - how should I time this thing? I'm going to
&gt; do it static; just can't figure out what the best timing for the thing
&gt; would be.
&gt;
&gt; #3 - Whaddya think - should I replace the dist. with the 009 from my '64
&gt; wreck? The Westy has a Weber carb and a stock distributor.
&gt;
&gt; Sheesh. Nothing's easy. Good thing it started raining here and I can sit
&gt; and drink coffee and think about all this for a while... :)
