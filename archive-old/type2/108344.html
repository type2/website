Subject: westy sliding door handle

Is there a source for the interior sliding door handles? I was hauling a bunch
of kids around for a church thing a few months back and when one of them went
to open the door, it broke in half. I could drill for some pins and JB Weld it
together I guess, but I was wondering if new ones were around. From my
understanding, the Westy handle is different than the passenger bus handle
