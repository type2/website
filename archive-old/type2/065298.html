Subject: 1776 owner

Last week, someone (from Australia I believe) posted some observations on 
how much he liked his 1776 dual carb setup. I trashed the message but would 
like to ask a few questions of that owner, as I am now considering a very 
similar engine for my 70.  Of course anyone who owns such an engine is 
invited to share their thoughts. My questions:
1) How many miles so far?
2) What's a comfortable cruising speed with this engine? (Can I go 70 mph 
without busting a gut?)
3) How's the mileage?
4) Does it start in cold weather? (more dual-carb related than engine size)
5) Do you get the impression this engine will live a long, healthy life?
Thanks
Bob
