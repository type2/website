Subject: Re: [T2] cv boots

If the boots are recently torn (not run a long distance with
&gt;torn boots) you can simply install new boots, regrease and install.  If
&gt;the CVs have dirt in them you need to disassemble them and clean with soap
&gt;and water.

-------------------------------------------------

I wouldn't suggest using soap and water on anything prone to corrosion, even 
if you intend on using the oven to dry the parts immediately thereafter.  
Use a solvent that will evaporate completely, without leaving any residue.  
I like Brake-kleen.
