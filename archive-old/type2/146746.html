&gt; Chris,

&gt;&gt;Your situation sounds like the brakes are not adjusted right - the
&gt;&gt;shoes. Need to be tighter.
&gt; 
&gt; Agreed

David,
I don't know how you could get your shoes any tighter as per your post, 
you said that you adjusted the shoes until the wheel wouldn't turn.  You 
almost over-tightened them so you *should* have great breaking action... 
actually, I do the same as you did, leaving them tight, because they 
&quot;break in&quot; and wear off after the initial adjustment and are in perfect 
adjustment after an hour or so of driving.

Anyways, I would open things back up and make sure that everything is in 
place correctly.  I would have someone press the brake and and see if 
the piston expands.  Just be careful that you don't do it too much or I 
think you can push the pistons out of the cylinder and make a mess.  But 
I would check that and see if the action looks correct.  You might have 
missed some that is not allowing the pads to move the way they normally 
move.

Also, how are you testing your rear brakes?  If you use the e-break, the 
rear of the bus will kinda drop.. it's definately a different feeling 
than when the front brakes kick in.  Have you lifted the back tires and 
pressed the pedal while spinning the wheel?

Mike
