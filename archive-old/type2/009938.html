I am looking for a engine for my 71 SC. The PO swapped trannys to a 77. I 
would like to find a complete late loaf engine in running, but not 
necessarily pristine condition. A type1 would do if there is nothing else 
available. Location is also a factor as shipping would be a killer. 200 
miles radius of Chattanooga, TN / Atlanta, Ga area.

'71 Singlecab
'76 Mango Westy

&quot;the bus came by, and I got on...thats when it all began...&quot;
