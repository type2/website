Subject: Re: [T2] primer/body filler query

No Tony-- 
The answer should really be --
Skip all the non metal fillers, impregnayted with polyester resin, or
epoxy which all have a dissimilar expanson, contraction rate than sheet
metal--- and use lead---which will never move---or pop off, or shrink,
or bleed through---

And aluminum powder doesn't have it either--

This is the best no holds barred--without any comparison--

You just have to find somebody that still knows how to use the stuff---

I still have the wood paddles, the tallow, and lead bars---

Or if you can't find anyone that can still make the lead flow-find a
skilled bodyman that can still use a hammer, dolly, and a body file
---ths is the right way to remove any imperfections
This is a art of the past---  

Later,

Terry

Skip the Bondo and go for one of the water-proof body fillers like
Met-All...Aluminum powder in an epoxy base.
