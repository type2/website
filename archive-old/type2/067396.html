Subject: icebox/sink combo

What is a fair price to offer for a Westy icebox/sink unit? It comes out of
a 71 and is in decent shape. I have a 69 Westy, but the PO tossed the said
unit, because &quot;it was too difficult to get around it to get in&quot;. The guy
saved a beat up, badly bent, bumper mounted, spare tire rack, but didn't
save a piece of the original interior - go figure.
