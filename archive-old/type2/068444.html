Subject: Re: Shift lever

Your mail with regard to your SCAT shifter supprises me, most people 
want to go the other way.

The SCAT shifter reduces the movement at the top of the stick by raising 
the pivot point. Additional shifting seems more positive. Reverting to a
standard shifter may actualy move the top of the stick further away.

Before making this change try adjusting the position of the gear stick...
Lift the boot at the base of the stick and slacken the two bolts that
hold the stick to the floor and move the whole stick mechanism to a
position that gives you a better 'stick top position'. 

WARNING you may find its possible to move your shifer to a position to
where its not possible to get 1st and 2nd (I did this).


To do a replacement the standard stick is as follows.
 -  Knob
 -  Rubber boot
 -  Stick with tapering spring at bottom, small end goes into a cup to
    which a flange with bot holes is attached
 -  Diamond shapped guide plate (different from Bettle) with bolt holes 
    to match flange above and floor.
 -  At the lower end of the stick there is a ball though which there is a 
    hole, a small spring goes in the wide end of the hole, and a pin 
    through the spring and out the other side of the hole. The pin 
    fits into a slot in the side of the cup on the linkage shaft and
    stops the stick from rotating.

fitting is described in Haynes/Bentley.

PS to fit the Scat shifter the PO will have cut a large rectange out of 
the carpet / rubber mat and the standard stick will leave a big (new
carpet size) gap.
