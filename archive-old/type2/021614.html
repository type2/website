Probably one of the best things to do is clean out your fuel injectors
if you haven't already.  There are shops that will service your
injectors and get them spraying nicely.  Another thing is to run Chevron
through your system (if they sell that gas near you).  I have heard many
people swear by the Techron that's used in the gasoline.  Otherwise, get
yourself some quality fuel injector additive and give that a try.  Best
bet is the shop option, though, cuz they clean the screens and test
them.

Personally, I'd be weary of getting another FI system unless it was
designed for a particular engine and tested thoroughly to get the
correct settings.  Or, if it had some kind of system allowing you to
dynamically change the mixture settings for various rpm, air pressure,
manifold vacuum, etc (whatever design it uses) settings.. 

Then, even to set that up, you'd need to either purchase a quality
air/fuel mixture meter (expensive) or go get it dyno tested.. a bunch of
times....

I'd just clean up what you have real nice, and make sure all your
connections are good.  One thing that I did was coat all my contacts
(including inside the AFM) with ProGold.  I have no affiliation with
them (caig products) but I know LOTS of audio engineers and electricians
that use it all the time.  It cleans contacts and also lubricates them
as well; something that can't be said for most electronic cleaners. 
Plus, it also seals up corroded connections and fun stuff like that...

Hope that helps!

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt;    Today I was looking at prices for replacing some of the old tired parts
&gt; on my 78 van fuel injection system. It was sobering to see that just to
&gt; replace the injectors would cost $360.00.
&gt;   At the same time I see that there are companies that specialize in new
&gt; fuel injection systems starting at about $850 and going up to around $2000.
&gt;    My question  to you:  Have any of you done such a complete change over to
&gt; an all new fuel injection system with success? If so, What company and
&gt; system did you go with ? One such company that I found on the web is called
&gt; Affordable Fuel Injection  at www.affordable-efi_dot_com .
&gt;    Also, I would imagine it is possible such an alternative system would
&gt; require a few other modifications such as different fuel pump. Any comments
&gt; ?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
