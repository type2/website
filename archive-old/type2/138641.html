Subject: RE: [T2] Compression and Valves

&gt;From: Don Tuleja

&gt;Someone shoot me.

&gt;Just shoot me. End this miserable excuse for a life.

&gt;Did a valve adjustment and compression check yesterday.

&gt;1: 122
&gt;2: 125
&gt;3: 119
&gt;4: 124

&gt;Better than the 80's I got last time! So what did I do?!?!?! I must
&gt;have adjusted the valves poorly, obviously. Grrrrr.......

&gt;Plus found my bottom end rattle! It wasn't the bottom end. It was a
&gt;loose alternator cover.

&gt;Arrrggghhhh!!!!
&gt;Put me out of my misery!!!!


Why? Sounds like you are getting right... now. The third strike is the one 
that gets you out. Good thing you hit it the second time.

Later,
