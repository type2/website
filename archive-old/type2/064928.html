Subject: Re: Pushrod tube seals

I'm very interested in getting my pushrod seals and valve cocer leaks under 
control and would appreciate getting receiving some of the tips you received. I 
just purchased an '82 GL van with a rebuilt engine, It looks really clean and I 
suspect that both the seals and cover were replaced approx 1,000 miles ago. I can 
see oil residue ( a little) beneath one of the heads near the valve cover and 
also under the cover end of the pushrod tubes. 

I'm getting the smell of burned oil (I suspect) from the oil dripping onto the 
heat exchangers. There isnt much dripping so it somewhat confuses me. Maybee 
there is still oil in it from before the engine overhaul?? The heat exchangers 
look pretty clean from the outside. 

Anyway, i'd appreciate whatever insight you might be able to provide me with.

Dear all,

Thanks to all your good advice the van no longer
leaves lovely patterns on the driveway.  It was much
easier than I imagined, the only difficulty was a couple
of rusted screws on the tinware, no plier squashed tubes, 
or heads cracked by flying rods, thanks to you.

Once all the oil was cleaned of the heatexchangers they were 
in a much better condition than I imagined. Does anyone
advocate a permanent oil leak as a form of rustproofing.

Yours gratefully
