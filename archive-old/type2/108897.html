Subject: oil pressure warning light 

When I turn my key on my oil light does not come on.  The alt light works fine
but not the oil.  I took the bulb out and the bulb holder.  The bulb holder
appears to be kaput.  Is the bulb holder only supposed to have one wire going
to it?

I just have the wire sticking out of the dash now.  When I turn the key on -
that wire should light a grounded test light - right?

I changed the pressure dealy in the engine but I'm a bit confused about this.
I clipped the single wire that is sticking out from under my dash to the wire
that connects to the high beam switch and then I used a test light on the wire
at the end that goes to the oil pressure switch and grounded it. When I turned
the key the test light lit up - I assumed that this means the wire is good
throughout.  But how does that switch get power to begin with.  I only have
one wire going to my switch.

Confused in Kingston
