Subject: Thermostat and 12V connection to carb
Message-ID: &lt;3753B3C3.3C3B76A0_at_informix_dot_com&gt;

While playing silly buggers with the pushrods over the weekend I discovered a couple
of other broken items on my 1977, 2.0L.

1) The thermostat cable had snapped so I replaced it with a thicker, bicycle, brake cable
   but what is the spec for the stat? It has 85-90 stamped on it and tested OK for that
   temp range but my manual (Haynes) says something more like 70, but only really covers 
   the earlier engine.

2) The electrical connection from coil to the main body of one of the Solex carbs has
   snapped off. Is this a big disaster? - engine runs OK (well used to, before I started
   fiddling with it ;-). I can't see an easy way to re-attach it without trying to solder 
   onto the two rivets that held the tag on. Is it safe to do so or will the insulation
   around the rivets melt?

Cheers,




Cosmo
