Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] deck height

There might be, but I do not know of it. I stopped wrenching for a living 15
years ago.

The problem is the amount of cylinder filling changes based on the cam,
heads, and RPM you are measuring at. IOW, a 7:1 engine with a stock cam will
give a cranking pressure close to a 10:1 big cam engine, but this pressure
changes as RPM go up.

I have seen Dynamic CR Calculators online in several places, but I have
never played with them to see if they corresponded to my experiences. If
someone finds one (I do not have time to look) I'll be happy to play with it
and see what I come up with.
