&gt; &gt; I am looking for a bit of advise for the removal of a starter on my 77 bus.
&gt; &gt; I only have one bolt left to remove, it is the top bolt and I cant seem to
&gt; &gt; locate it. Chilton's states &quot; have a helper hold the nut on the top bolt
&gt; 
&gt; because the Chilton is wrong, that information is for the older type I
&gt; engine

I didn't notice that you were referring to Chilton.  If I had, my first
advice would be:

Buy the Bentley manual and save the Chilton for specialized tasks such as
wiping dipsticks.
