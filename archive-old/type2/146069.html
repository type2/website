Subject: Re: [T2] Autobraking (Brake pedal gets 'sucked' down when I
  decellerate)

75 bus with 76 Bosch FI.
Vacuum is connected to the booster.  Haven't checked all the vacuum hoses
yet.  just trying to figure out whats going on.  I'll check the check
valve tomorrow.  The hoses all look good and I have a hard time believing
that the MC went bad already.  Its brand new.  I'll do some knuckle
busting tomorrow and see what I come up with.

&gt; Zach,   we need more information, does it have carbs,
&gt; vacuum set up on the brake booster, the brake booster
&gt; could be the problem or the one way check valve could
&gt; be bad. Check all the vacuum hoses anyway. Phil
