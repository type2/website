Airs Members,
   My wife and I will be driving our 71 westy from Long Island, New York to 
Flint, Michigan on August 20 and 21.  Our return will be the following 
weekend.  I've printed out the appropriate states from the AIRS list, but 
hopefully, I won't need to call any of you for help.  But if you live near 
route 80 east of Michigan, this is your warning to gas up the cars, stock up 
on beer, and turn down the volume of the ringer on your phones.
   Our bus has been running just fine lately and I don't really expect a 
problem.  Of course that's how I felt back in April when I headed out for 
Everybus 2000.  Needless to say the bus didn't make it to the event, but I 
did in our other car.
   Everyone have a great weekend,

Paul A
Huntington Station, New York
71 westy
