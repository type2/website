Subject: Re: [T2] Re; Powdercoating Rims

&gt;there is a potential problem area.
&gt;The crevice between the wheel rim and the center
&gt;tends to void application, due to an electromagnetic
&gt;phenomena called the Faraday Cage effect.
&gt;The angle of the sharply opposing surfaces
&gt;tends to repel the charge and the powder.

We got powder in there but it is uneven. Another lister recommended white 
(choose your color) caulking to seal this area.
