I agree with you, I would just sort of do without all the attention if I had
my way. Driving my split around town gets me the slack-jawed gapers and the
occasional compliments, last week some guy in a &quot;Trans-Am&quot; gave me the peace
sign....&quot;oh ick&quot;. I suppose they mean well, on the other hand maybe they're
just being smart asses.
Sometimes I enjoy the &quot;when I was a kid, I drove across the rockies in one
of those...&quot; when I'm buying gas, and sometimes I've got other things on my
mind; I always try to be nice and personable; I'm always hoping for the one
time someone will come up and say &quot;You know, I've got a couple of those
someone left in a barn, sure would like to get them out of there....&quot;
Once my wife and I were pulling into the parking lot of a local restaurant
and a bunch of kids started making a fuss about our bus, she looked at me
and said &quot;you know, I'm just not in the mood&quot;. That pretty well sums it up
for me too.
The thing I'm afraid of is the time when &quot;non-bus people&quot; will buy them
because they're fashionable and then not wave back on the highway. When I
had an old ratty 912 Porsche in college, I'd wave to the Orthodontist types
in their new Carerra's and some would visibly wince, or pointedly ignore me
because their cars were perfect and mine wasn't.I hope this never happens to
buses.
