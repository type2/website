Subject: [T2] Thread Size

Volks,

I am having one hell of a time trying to get this damm Oil Filler pipe leak 
free. Does anyone know the thread size of the nuts that connect the Oil 
Filler pipe to the sump? I think wrench size is 13mm and thread size 9mm?? 
I'm not sure about this it's only a guess but I would like to get it back 
together and not loose a quart of oil each day.

Thanks,
