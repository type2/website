&gt; Sean, that seems a little harsh.

When a member signs onto the list, they get a copy of the list charter.
In this charter are the rules by which members are to abide to remain in
good standing.  One of the cardinal rules is that you don't post spam to
the list.  It is obviously impolite to subject 1000 listees to reading
the spammer's off-topic message.

Spam is like a cancer,
and we cannot permit it to spread.  Our philosophy is that it is better to
ban the offender outright than it is to make potential offenders feel as
if they are always entitled to a second chance.

The list is not a democracy, rather it is more like a benign dictatorship.
We strive to keep it on-topic and useful to the members.  Spam, no matter
how well-meaning, has no place here.

George Lyle, List Administrator, First shift.
