Amen.  If the clips are wired in I can see no other reason to go thru 
the hassle of putting a later-style arrangement in there.  I mean, it's 
not a HUGE pain to pull the bell housing (and fascinating to look inside 
the tranny), but IMHO not really worth it just for that.

(I will add that if you gotta take the bell housing off anyhow, it makes 
replacing the mainshaft seal very easy!)

&gt;&gt; wiring the circlip that goes around the cross shaft next to 
&gt;&gt; the bushing.
&gt; 
&gt; To do this you have to grind a bit of relief in the washer next to the
&gt; bushing to accommodate the safety wire.

Ah - I hadn't thought of that.  Thanks.
