Dream on...That was an auction...Prices at those &quot;events&quot; are wildly divergent from prices of real

sell...You can ask whatever you want for anything...
Besides, how much do you think the seller already has spent on that $41,000 VW...Including the trailer (it
sure wasn't driven to the auction) and garaging (it doesn't see sunshine much less snow...?-)

300079782203.....

2006 Complete body renovation (over $4,500 worth)  used all top quality material for body work.
and then this: Quarter panels probably need repainting (not bad however slight imperfections).
and : Metal inside bus needs repainted (have plenty of paint)
Have 1 qrt paint.

Still needs
Tie down latches for roof (4 at 9.99 each)
HUH?  Last I looked at a 68-73, it only took 3.....
