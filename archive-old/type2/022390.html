&gt;Can anyone fill me in on my airconditioning? This has a large compressor? on
&gt;the drivers side of the engine compartment when you open the rear lid, and a
&gt;complex vent system attached under the main dash up front. There are 6 (I
&gt;believe) adjustable vents on this system with a min/off/max knob on the left
&gt;side, and a temp? knob to the right. It does not appear to be working, but
&gt;blows lots of air. :-) I didn't notice a belt to the compressor, how does
&gt;this thing work?

The compressor is mounted &quot;backwards&quot;.  The belt is behind the fan housing.  Unfortunately, it's a narrow, non-standard belt and I would be willing to bet that yours is missing.  Last I checked the belts were still available at the dealer for about $20, but be warned that replacing the belt might just be the beginning of the costs associated with getting the A/C working.
