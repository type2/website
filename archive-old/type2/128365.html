Subject: Found another bus....

I have a 78 transporter whose engine recently siezed. 
I am getting the engine rebuilt for 3k and am now in
debt 2k dollars to my parents. However, I found a 69
bus in very good condition and many many more features
then the one I have now for only 1500.  So now I want
to sell the 78.  Would that be the right decision,
having put all that money into it, and if so, what
should I sell it for.  The body is decent, surface
rust and 3 or 4 rust through spots, and the engine is
brand new rebuilt.  It's a decent bus over all, and
could be fixed up with minor work.  Any help you guys
can provide would be awesome.
