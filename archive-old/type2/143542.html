Subject: Re: [T2] Brake hoses changed

&gt; All of the brake lines, with the exception of the clogged one, seemed to be
&gt; in
&gt; perfectly good condition (not worn or cracked or deteriorated in the
least),
&gt; and I've saved the three good hoses for emergency spares.  Given the good
&gt; condition of the other hoses, I should have invoked the if-it-ain't-broke
&gt; rule
&gt; and replaced only the clogged one,

All of your brake lines are deteriorated, even if there seems to be no degra-
dation...Rubber ages even if it's not used. Tires are perhaps the worst in
this area, tho'. New old tires are suspect at best, but any old rubber pro-
duct is a gamble...Of course, this is offset by the &quot;quality&quot; of the replace-
ment part, so's you pays yer money and takes yer chances... ;-(
