Subject: Re: [T2] Lost my keys!!!

Hi Todd,

Assuming you can still get into the bus....

Is the key for the ignition the same as the rear hatch? If so, pull the 
rear hatch and there will be a code number on it. Then visit  
www.steveslockshop_dot_com and call Steve Sandlin. He will take your credit 
card info and ship you a new key.

I had this experience with my camper back in 2000, and Steve was a 
great help.

Happy trails,

&gt; Ok... well, looks like I lost the keys to my VW Bus. I know, I know. 
&gt; I've
&gt; never lost keys to any car before in my life... but this time I did.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, what do I need? Steering wheel puller, etc?
&gt;
&gt; I figured I would just get an entirely new lock cyl. Do they sell 
&gt; those?
