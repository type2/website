Subject: New to list.

Hello to all,

        I am new to this list as of 9/18/96. I currently drive a 1987 Jetta. My interest of VW's 
goes back 17 years when my sister had a bug and I couldn't drive it enough. I want to purchase an 
old VW but I am so confused as to which one. If I had the money I would buy one of each model, Bug, 
Kharman Ghia, Squareback, Bus etc. My current fascination with the Bus or Camper cannot be ignored. 
I guess it will be the one I choose. Is there anyone out there who can tell me if one year stands 
out as a &quot;good&quot; one. Are they pretty much all the same? I am just starting to look, and being in 
New England doesn't give me a great choice. 

        I am looking forward to receiving all the info I can about these vehicles. I have 90 
messages waiting to be read and this is only my first day on the list. One last quesion, Is there a 
list somewhere out there that has all the models and what year they were made?
