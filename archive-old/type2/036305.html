Subject: Re: Free to good Home &quot;79 &quot; Bus

&gt;Hi folks,
&gt;
&gt;I have a 79 bus here in NH that I am going to give away. There is no rot on
&gt;this bus, just surface. The frame is pristine, the floors are very 
&gt;good..................


This vehicle is obviously overpriced.  After the costs of repair and 
rejuvenation are factored in, a rational person would realize that 
for the same kind of $$$ they could own a fine, 5-6 year old 
plastiqiojellybeanmobilio.      8^]

This is a fine offer,  a tip o' the old hat to Matt on this one.
