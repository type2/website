Subject: Re: pair of wiper arms 68

Somewhere on the internet there is, or used to be, a site that tells about recalls for various cars. I think that's where I read that those side bolt wipers were a VW recall back in '68 or '69. The great advantage of this later style is that it will grab virtually any wiper post no matter how much its been destroyed by its original arm and not let go. Visualize grabbing on to one of your digits after hitting it unexpectedly when your wrench slips.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; No. Only '68 wiper arms will fit in a 1968 Bus. 
&gt; 
&gt; ****Aren't there 2 different wipers used in 68? Correct me if I'm wrong. 
&gt; *The &quot;earlier&quot; being similar to Splitties and just &quot;clipping&quot; over the shaft 
&gt; and... 
&gt; *The &quot;later&quot; having the sideways bolts/nuts. 
&gt; 
&gt; I have the &quot;later&quot; 68 only arms- the bolted kind. 
&gt; But, a local 68 DC (you know who you are :-) and the pictures that Joao just 
&gt; sent me confirm the &quot;earlier&quot; kind without the sideways bolts. 
&gt; 
&gt; Or, did someone just put splittie wipers on these 68's (without the sideways 
&gt; bolts)?
