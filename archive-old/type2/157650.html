Subject: Re: [T2] Spare Tire Cover Brand New Need to Sell

&gt; I just received a new spare tire cover in the mail from a great
reputable Bus parts supplier, it is very nice, well constructed, white
with black piping that looks really cool, unfortunatly it doesn't fit
over my spare tire.

&gt; I had assumed that my spare was a stock size, but it is a 195-75/14
(which is the same size as the tires I put on the bus, so that is kind of
nice).

If it won't fit on a 195/75R14, it won't fit on a stock tire.  The 195/75
is actually smaller than the stock 185R14.
