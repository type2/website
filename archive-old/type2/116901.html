Subject: '79 Fuel Pump Problem

Greetings,

I feel that I need to reintroduce myself, due to my 2 year absence from this
list.  I have been lurking and reading posts on a daily basis and really
enjoyed all of the information presented here.

I've got a '79 Westy, all stock/original.  This bus has been my baby for the
past 5 years and has never let me down.  Due to some dramatic life changes
and a hectic work schedule, she has been parked in her dedicated space in my
garage for the past 10 months.  Deciding it was time to get her back into my
daily routine, I went about getting her ready for the road and some late
summer and fall camping trips.  Oil change, fresh battery, etc.  She ran
perfectly when I parked her and usually starts right up, even after a long
Minnesota winter of hibernation.  This time, no go.  I've got spark and
compression, but no fuel.  Fuel flow to the pump is fine and I've got 12
volts at the pump. I disconnected the fuel line on the &quot;out&quot; side of the
pump and nothing.  The pump gets warm to the touch after a short period of
cranking and I've tried tapping it with a piece of wood.  Still no flow.
Anyone have any ideas before I spend the $150 for a new pump.  It seems odd
that it would fail after an extended period of non-use, but I should know
better than to assume anything with these vehicles.

Thanks in advance,

Rob Weisel
