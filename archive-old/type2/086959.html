&gt; It will get hotter than if the car is running!
&gt; 
&gt; When the car is running, current flows through the coil about half the
&gt; time (when the points are closed).  When the car is stopped with the key
&gt; on, there is a 50-50 chance that the points will be closed and that
&gt; current will flow at the engine's particular postion.

and they can get hot enough to catch fire, ask me how I know ;8*_at_

&gt; &gt; Dear Listees:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Last night while me and son were trouble-shooting the electrical in our 70
&gt; &gt; bus, he noticed that the coil was very hot.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; We had not been running the engin at all.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; We were just following wires and such around to find problems.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I touched the coil and it was very hot.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; We disconnected it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Do these coils get hot when the ignition is on with the motor not running?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Do they get hot when the engine is running?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I think we have a wiring problem to the coil, right?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Many thanks.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Bill and Erik Spencer
