&gt; HI all hope i can help,
&gt;     I just looked at my 78 and the blue one goes to the cold start the brown
&gt; goes to the temp sensor and the black goes to the aux air control.
&gt;     The temp sendor is a PITA to get to, just remember that the half moon
&gt; side of the plug faces down.


I thought of those 3 initialy, but they are all 2 pin terminals and not
grey...... here is the 1st paragraph of the post:

''Last night, I discovered an unconnected wire dangling about in the engine
compartment (recent rebuild).  It is grey, the unconnected-end has a
three-prong attachment (bent, incidentally), and it appears to be attached
to something below the air intake distributor, to the firewall (tin).  I can
only reach it by jamming my hand beneath the AFM and snaking towards (&amp;
below) the gas tank.''

I just looked at 2 FI harness's I have laying in the driveway, a 78 and a 79
Cal. Neither have a 3 pin 'any color' plug. I thought maybe the microswitch
connecter, but it is 2 separate wires.
I looked at my 77 up around the heater fan......no grey plugs.
I don't believe your wire is part of the FI system. Is there any way you can
follow the wire in the other direction??
