Hey all.....thanks for all the help you have provided me.  I have my 
site up.  Well, some of it anyway.  The VW portion of it is up and 
running.  Its got pics of my 78' Baywindow that I am repairing as I 
drive it daily.  Let me know what you think.  At the bottom of the 
page is a link to the pics.  Some are kinda high quality so give em a 
sec.  Let me know what you think.  Once again, you have all helped me 
out alot and I appreciate it.  Keep on rollin'
