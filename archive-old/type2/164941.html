Subject: Re: [T2] I'm hitting the garage door!

&gt;I need to lower my  Riviera at least an inch.  When I drive it into
&gt; the garage of the new place, the roof scrapes against the garage
&gt; opening.


Is this a garage on a house or is this a parking garage?

If its a parking garage then I would suggest that a simple set of dropped 
spindles for the front and adjustable lowering plates (boomerang) for the 
rear.....that wll drop your bus about 2&quot; safely can always be returned to 
stock if needed....

If its your house garage then I would do what Tony suggested, raise the end 
stopping point of the garage door to clear your bus.....
