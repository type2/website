Subject: Thanks

Fellow Listees
I want to thank the list for the input to the electrical problem I'm
having. I was freaking out last night and I don't know why. The list was
quick at hand to put me back on the right road and stop stressing over
replacing my alternator (DUH).
On one hand I think this old bus has to go and on the other, I somehow
LOVE the adventure. Although I don't look forward to the next one.
Unless it's a trip to Santa Cruz with the Mt Bikes and friends.

Thanks again

George and the &quot;Beacon&quot;
