I'm the '71 camper back with another question or two.  How can I tell if 
my calipers are stock '71 or upgraded to the '73-'79 size?  I also have a 
'73 Transporter part/possible project sitting at Dad's.  The easy answer 
would be to compare the two.  Problem is that this '73 is 2 hours away and 
I barely have enough time to spit when I visit.  Could someone tell me how 
to check my '71 and give me a quick breakdown... err, uhhh... HOW-TO (no 
breakdowns, please!  We all have enough of these already!) on how to do 
the switch.  I can't afford any manuals right now and the library only has 
two copies.  One was stolen and I've had the other on hold for weeks.

Have a good one,
Eric
