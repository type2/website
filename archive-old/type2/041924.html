I'm just wondering how worth it is to spend a hundred dollars more on a meter
when the fuel settings aren't going to be perfect and they won't even stay
stable because the system (ECU) doesn't compensate for O2 readings unless you
have an ECU model from a later year.  Granted, your unit could (and probably
will be) used on vehicles other than VWs..

What are you really paying for when you add the 100 extra bux (compared to the
CB Performance meter, which has a heated element and goes from 12 to 17
:1(analog gauge))?  My guess is that the extra cost doesn't come from the meter
because it's just a matter of adding another LED(for the non-gauge ones) and
maybe doing some minor electrical changes.  But, I'm also guessing that the
reason people haven't added those extra LEDs at the end of their meters is
because the O2 output curve is so steep towards the outside and would give, like
you and many others said, inaccurate readings?  So, summing this all up, it
seems like the real accuracy lies within the quality O2 sensor?  What kind of
sensor are you guys using?  I'm curious to know...

Thanks,
MIke
