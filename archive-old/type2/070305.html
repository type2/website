&gt;This has turned into a thread with a life of its own, removed completely from
&gt;the VW content to which it was originally attached, sorry about that Volks
&gt;(there now there is some content).  In answer, the MacIIsi is a wimpy machine
&gt;incapable of supporting advanced functions like video or free-tel, has only an
&gt;80Mb hard drive that is at 90% of capacity, and only 8 Mb of RAM, so it looks
&gt;like I am going to start piecing together a PC for her for Christmas, even
&gt;though I like my Mac PowerPC, I just can't afford one for home.

Here's some VW content.  I gave my mom in Germany a MacIIsi last year so I
could send her Vanagon e-mail.  She has a '94 Eurovan Westfalia (full
version) and is interested in our list, but can't keep up with the traffic,
even in digest mode.  :)

Despite what you say, the IIsi is a perfectly capable machine.  I bought
four 4-meg simms for my mom's computer recently for $100, now she has 17
megs... plenty.  She also is running system 7.5.3, MacTCP 2.06, Eudora,
Netscape 2.0, and on and on, all over a 28.8 modem from GERMANY!  Plenty of
&quot;internet applications&quot; run really well on the IIsi.  I hate to see
Mac-bashing like this.
Her whole computer system barely cost $500, and granted it's a little slow,
but you can't get anything better in the PeeCee world for that price.  Did
I mention it has a Trinitron monitor?  Oh, and by the way, there is no way
you can have 8 megs of RAM on a IIsi.  You either have 5 megs, or 9.  Have
a day...  :P
