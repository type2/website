X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL - S

&gt; PayPal is your friend; if you open a new PayPal account and use
&gt; tedebare_at_one_dot_net as a reference, it gets you five dollars and us five
&gt; dollars as well. Even if you are utterly broke, not a dime to your name,
&gt; you can figure out how to donate $10 to the list like that. And later
&gt; when you get some money you can easily buy stuff off of Eb_at_y with your
&gt; PayPal account. Go to www.x_dot_com to get started.

One minor point Hoop, et all, the $5/$5 referral bonus is for US accounts
only, I just set up a 2nd account with the email account I use for the T2
list (Tigger), and tried the referral, to get a &quot;US Accounts only message&quot;
in regard to the bonus.

No biggie, I'm sure that at least 80-90% of the list membership's US based,
so it still applies for all you guys.

FYI,

Neale
