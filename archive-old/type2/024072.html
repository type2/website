I was 15 when I learned to drive my bus.  At first I just sat in the bus, 
didn't even start it up, and I practices switching gears.  I had my dad take 
me around the neighborhood, which was good practice for stopping and 
starting. Then we went into the country where there were long roads and 
little traffic to practice 3rd and 4th gear.  After doing that a few times, I 
got the hang of it.  The day I got my lisence I just went out on my own cause 
I wanted to drive the thing sooo bad, and yes, I killed it a couple times, 
but Iearned best when I was just thrown out onto the streets and pretty much 
had to know how to drive it.  Now I love driving it, and hate driving 
anything else.
