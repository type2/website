Hi everybody!

The location for the Type2_dot_campout (aka EVERYBUS) has changed but the  dates
have remained the same( April 16,17,18). The new location is Hagan-Stone
Park located just south of Greensboro, NC. The new site is a 400 acre park,
campground and wildlfe refuge. We have reserved 30 slots in the RV field
with hookups. There are plenty more spaces including a tent loop if we need
them. P-mail me ( vw69bus_at_mindspring_dot_com ) if you are coming so we can
reserve more sites if need be. 

The website has been updated with new maps and details on the campout.
Please check it out at
