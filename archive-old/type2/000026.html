Hey guys and girls public slander on anybody's part is uncalled for, and I 
have yet to see a one sided coin, but I do know that I like this mailing list 
and work 12-16 hours a day restoring them.  So time is very limited to read 
my mail so please stick to the content, its hard enough to keep up as it is.
Peace Out
Rick
