Subject: Bay Window rear sway bar

When I was at the Spring meet on Washington I bought a rear anti sway bar
for my 71 Westy. I decided that I better install the darn thing before I
travel down to L.A. for the OCTO/Classic weekend. As far as I can tell it
bolts to the frame rails via supplied brackets and then the ends bolt to the
bolts which hold the spring plates on. Can anyone who has a rear bar verify
this or point me in the right direction? Any pictures would be greatly
appreciated. Also if you see Kate (11) or I in the Roadcow please stop by
and say Hi.
