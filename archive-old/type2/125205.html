Subject: RE: [T2] POR-15 and TK---

&gt; I used it on a '76 Westy, cab floor and on
&gt; the chassis, and 3 years later no rust had
&gt; returned. I'm a believer in POR 15.


Just a note that in addition to the quarts of POR-15, we now sell a
complete kit as well. This is primarily intended for spot use, such as
touch up of smaller rust areas. It includes enough POR-15 to do &quot;up to
12 square feet&quot; as they optimistically put it, depending on how heavy
you lay it on. As compared to a quart's &quot;up to 96 square feet&quot; this is
not a huge amount, so you may want to get two kits rather than finding
yourself short. Unlike the quarts, the kit also includes all of the prep
stuff that POR-15 recommends, such as a water-based degreaser and
MetalReady etcher, and even rubber gloves and brushes. While all of
these items (or something comparable) besides the POR-15 itself can be
found at any auto paint supply house, this will save you the hassle of
the trip and worrying about getting the right stuff. For smaller jobs,
this may be an easier (and cheaper) solution than buying a quart of
POR-15 plus the prep supplies separately, only to have to store the most
of the quart when you're done. (If you do store it, make sure to reseal
any unused quantities quickly or it will go bad; i.e. pour some out to
work with rather than working right out of the open can for a long
time.)

The kits are only $14.95 each.
