Hi Dan,

Just this morning I updated the heater articles on my page to include some
pictures that might be helpful:

http://www.type2_dot_com/rvanness/index.htm

Once I finish tweaking the heater articles (I'm a super tweak) I'll update
Sean's tech page with the current edition, but for now the latest can be
found at the address above.

&gt;lucky enough to have all the manuals; however, I'm
&gt;unsure about what to do with the ductwork.  Charles
&gt;Miller fitted it with a way of using warm cabin air, so
&gt;I need a plan to duct the hot air, warm air in, and the
&gt;muffler/intake install in the rear.  I read the
&gt;excellent article in the archives, but I still wonder
&gt;if anyone has any templates for where the holes should
&gt;be made.  

For the traditional engine compartment installation, I have templates for
the intake &amp; exhaust location for the early BN4, but not the firewall or
under seat template.  The under the seat exit is easy to do without a
template, but the firewall cut might be tricky without one.  

For anyone else doing the same on a later bus, I also have templates and the
VW dealer installation guide for the late model BN4.  It's specifically for
the '72 bus, but I think '72-'74 should be the same.

If you just need the early BN4 templates, drop me your address and I'll mail
them.  For the later BN4 guide/templates, send $2 to cover shipping and copying.

&gt;Am I correct in assuming I'll have to pull the engine
&gt;to do this?

It can conceivably be done with the engine in, but the worst part would be
the firewall, which you could probably cut with a Dremel with the engine in,
but you'd be seriously cramped.  With the engine out you can remove the
firewall and make the cut neatly on your work bench, and it will be much
easier to cut the exhaust hole as well.  I cut the exhaust and intake holes
with the engine in, the rest with the engine out.
