Subject: RE: Cargo holder for sale

To all,

        I have a 50&quot;w x 71&quot;l x 16h wooden box. It is waterproof and is mounted to two &quot;Thule&quot; roof 
racks. It fit right od the gutters of a '78. It has a lockin hasp and can hold approx 26 cu. ft. of 
cargo. I'm not looking to rip anyone off, but at the same time I don't want to get screwed either. 
I called an RV place got a price for a typical storage unit approximately the same size. I think it 
should be worth between $200-$300 dollars. The racks alone I know are expensive.

        I have attempted to attach a Word for windows document with a drawing in it to show what it 
looks like. I don't know if an attached file will make the trip but here it goes.

        Any advice to the worth of this thing would be greatly appreciated.

Thanx,
