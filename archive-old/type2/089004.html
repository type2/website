Subject: how to find vac leak?

------=_NextPart_000_0091_01C2191D.1143D7C0
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Well, I'd swear I don't have a leak, but it's hard not to trust a brand =
new vac pump that reads 12-13 at idle. I need a way to locate the leak.  =
I have disconnected and plugged all the smaller hoses like brake =
booster, nipple between #1 &amp; #2 runner, aux air reg, decel valve, =
crankcase vent and it still reads 12-13.=20
I verified the large &quot;S&quot; hose to be airtight.  The 4 intake runner hoses =
were new in 99 and are tight to feel. Gasket/block between runners and =
head were new at same time and torqued to spec.=20
I don't want to spray carb cleaner(paint remover) which would =
deteriorate hoses and ugly up a very clean engine.   I did try some =
butane lighter fluid near the runner to head gaskets and at the plenum =
to runner hoses with no idle change.  Then I shot some in the air =
cleaner intake to test it and it killed the engine immediately. (was =
expecting idle to speed up, but I guess not)
Do we agree that vac should be 17&quot; (not 12) AT IDLE?  I can only hit =
17-20 if I rev the engine.=20
Any hints appreciated!  Also, where would I find new vac hose sized =
right for the aux-air-regulator to &quot;S&quot; intake.  Mine has had the ends =
trimmed for the last time as it is getting short.=20
Thanks all!
Jay
