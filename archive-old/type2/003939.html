Subject: engine and auto tranny come out together in 79 Westy???

My Haynes says I have to remove the 090 auto tranny and engine as a unit in
my 79 Westy. It seems to contradict itself, as the supplement at the back of
the book says the 090 has to come out together with engine, yet earlier in
the book it says if you're concerned about weight, remove the engine first.
Has anyone got any experience with this?
Thanks again,
Courtney
