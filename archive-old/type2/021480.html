Greetings...

My wife to be and I are getting wed on the 4th of August and then 
heading out for a three week road trip in our new to us 74 type 2.
We have a few problems. The main one, being we are looking for some of 
the more interesting sites to see, and as I have traveled the states a 
fair amount I have some good ideas of places to go. Dasha, my wife to 
be, has lived for the last 20 years in NYC and before that in Russia, 
she has seen little of the states, most of which was CA when she was 
about 14. The second problem on our list is the bus, It was running 
fine, well within reason, then the webber carb started to leak and I 
took it in to get it fixed, no room here to work on it, Brooklyn after 
all is not the best place to work on the street on your bus, Long story 
short (I know, to late..) its not running as well as it once was after 
it got out of the shop, not being a great engine mechanic I am in need 
ot a referance for a reasonably qualified repair tech in the Brooklyn 
area that I can get to have a good going over of the engine before we 
head off on the road. And third, sort of ties the first two together, 
any one out there who can help figure out what is going on in a VW's 
belly that might be located near some hither to before unknown wonder 
and mystery of the USA (or perhaps Canada) that would be interested in 
letting a guy and his every so lovely, charming, and talented wife stop 
in on there honeymoon and lend a hand should they need it??
Quite frankly, its an important trip for us and I want to know I have a 
few places across the country that might be able to lend us a hand 
should the old girl spit and sputter her last along the way.

Any and all sugestions for places to visit will be greatly appreciated.

Much Thanks..

Dave And Dasha
