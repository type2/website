Hey there...
  Just a couple o' questions... 1) I haven't seen many baywindows with Empi wheels. Why is this? I'm considering 5-spoke Empi's for my 68 kombi, but before I invest, does anyone know if they are interchangeable with the stock rims? BTW, the PO put 70's era bus rims on it.
  That brings me to question no. 2: The padded portion behind the front seats (around the panels) was pretty bad, so I tore them out. Can you get new ones? Has anyone else encountered this?
  Your feedback is greatly appreciated =0) BTW, great site Shelby!

Peace &amp; Harmony
