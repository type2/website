Subject: RE: [T2] Vehicle history report pre-81

&gt;From: Arnaud Meylan
&gt;My eyes are on a '71 and I have the VIN for it. However it is a pre-1981 
&gt;10-digit VIN for which Carfax does not work. ( Since 1981 VINs are 16digit)

&gt;Is there a way to get some vehicle history report ?


Try six 0's before the Vin. ;)

Later,
