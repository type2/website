Subject: Re: New Vacuum adv. dizzy isn't identical to old, can i use it or..?

      Well, at least it's for a T4 engine (unless those early 1700 dizzys
didn't advance as far???) - it might be make to work for the meantime by
just figuring out which port should be hooked to the vacuum -- one is to
advance the spark, the other is to retard it, has to do with one of the
pre-FI emission schemes. You might even be able to just get a new vacuum
canister. Not sure why it wouldn't let the engine idle, but it could be that
the vacuum diaphragm is leaking.

&gt; Ok, I found out that this new/used dizzy is for a 1974 * 1700 Manual
&gt; Trans, Dual Carbs,
&gt; probably not the right one...
