Subject: [T2] Rear torsion adjustment - request for comments

My 71 westy has more than usual butt-sag, plus the camber seems off 
(splayed out at bottom) which _might_ be due to the sag, but I'm not 
sure.  If it were a swing-axle, I'd say that's why, but do IRS trannys 
also undergo camber changes with suspension flex?

Anyhoo I'm contemplating the spring-plate adjustment procedure.  I've 
gone over the stuff in the Type2 library and read some posts in the 
archives going back to '96 or so.  I've read Haynes for the geometry 
info.  The procedure doesn't sound overly difficult (heh, heh, sure).

I'm thinking I should just pull the plate off the outer end of the 
torsion bar and crank it down one notch (and therefore raise the rear by 
one notch-worth).  Do I also need to do the inner end -- ie, will just 
one notch at the outer end be too much?

Comments on this and on your experiences with ride height and handling 
after spring plate tweakage would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Joe
