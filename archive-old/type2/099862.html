Subject: Installation of Espar Heater

Looked through the archives on this and didn't find anything.  I'm looking
for someone that is experienced with installing an Espar heater.  I have a
complete one that came with the last bus that I purchased and would like to
get it installed.  I live in the Chicago area.  Anywhere within 4 to 5 hours
is OK.  I've contacted Espar and they sent me to the local Espar dealer but,
they won't install anything into a VW.  I'm a little leary of installing
this myself.  My luck and I don't do it right and I'll burn up my bus.
Can't have that!
