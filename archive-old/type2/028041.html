Subject: RE: [T2] brazillian cab gaskets

&gt; hi - i am surveying to see if listees found the brazillian front door
&gt; gaskets worthy; whether them gaskets held up and were worth money. any of
&gt; you wish you'd waited out for something german?



The answer you get will depend on the specific seals in question.

If you buy your front door seals from pretty much anyone but me, you will
receive one of two brands of aftermarket Brazilian made door seals (perhaps
relabeled with another name depending on the vendor, but that's what they'll
be).  The quality of these seals is definately inferior to any of the
genuine VW seals, German or otherwise, in terms of both fit and quality.

I normally ship genuine VW/Brazil front door seals.  I am the only one in
the country who has them.  These are far superior to the aftermarket ones in
terms of both quality and fit, but still inferior in both regards to the
original German ones that came on your bus. I sell them for $19.95 each,
which is about what most places charge for the lower-quality aftermarket
Brazilian seals. However, the bad news is that I presently have only a
limited supply and no more coming for 3 months, so it is likely that by
mid-September I will be forced to substitute the aftermarket ones until new
stock arrives. Part number 211 831 721D (left) and 211 831 722D (right).

With regard to German seals, until recently they were completely unavailable
at any price, having been discontinued by VW about three years ago. And in
another month they will probably again be unavailable, possibly forever. But
for a very short time they can be had.  I received on my last shipment from
Europe six pair of original German Volkswagen front door seals. These were
obtained from a dealer in Germany who still had them on the shelf, and it is
very unlikely that any more will turn up when they are gone. I am selling
them for $199 a pair, while they last, which is about 25% off of the
original dealer price. Yes, they are definately better than the Brazilian VW
seals, with proper corners etc. Are they worth 5 times the price?  That's up
to you.  If you plan to have your bus a long time, they probably are.  Part
number 211 898 721D.

Incidentally, the same difference applies to virtually all of my '68-79
seals. 90 percent of what I ship is either OE Volkswagen, or European made
aftermarket.  Many of them are unavailable anywhere else.  Another good
example is my front door outside window scrapers (with chrome strip), which
are genuine VW whereas literally everybody -yes, everybody- else in the
country is shipping the same relatively ill-fitting aftermarket Brazilian
one (for the same price!).  I'm not saying I never ship an aftermarket
Brazilian or Mexican seal, but my resources for seals are fairly good since
I'm a direct importer, and I only settle for the low-end stuff when no other
option is available.
