Subject: 1st T4 engine drop - please help!

Listees,

I am considering dropping my engine in my 82 Westy.  Basically I'm wondering 
if you guys think that I can pull it off. I feel pretty confident about 
preping for dropping and the actualy engine drop as I'm going to have a 
friend with me that's really good at this sort of thing. I'm doing a 
compression test this weekend and if I have to replace the heads, I'm 
wondering how difficult it is to tear down the engine and replace the seals, 
oil cooler, heads, and clutch.

I've done the same thing one a Type 1 engine on my 71 I had and I'm 
wondering how much harder the Type 4 is in terms of actually working on it 
and putting it back in. I mean if the Type 4 is like 50 times harder than 
the Type 1 I'm probably not skilled enough to pull it off. How high do you 
have to jack it up? I loved how I didn't have to jack up my bus with my 71 
to drop the engine. Also I think I'm leaning towards the dropping 
engine/tranny as unit style but what is easiest to do in terms of putting 
the engine back in?

My very cool neighbor next door is going to let me use his garage so I will 
have cover and a concreate slab to work on. I told him it may take 3 weeks 
or so from start to finish. And this time I would be able to take my time on 
everything as opposed to last time I dropped the engine on my 71 I needed it 
for transportation and there was snow on the ground and I was working 
outside. I'm hoping I could get it all back together around the first week 
of August.

And I really need to get and study the Bentley for the Vanagon before I 
touch anything. I gave my bay window Bentley with my 71. Any one have a 
Vanagon Bentley for sale?

Thanks so much for any insight/help,

Daniel
