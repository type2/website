Subject: VW nuts

I bow before the disassembled Gods of VW lore.

I'm trying to replace the WW switch in my 68 loaf.  I got a new one 
from Bus Depot.  The terminals and washer hose connections look the 
same as the one that's in the bus now.  The special &quot;VW nut&quot; that 
holds the switch to the dash is different for the new switch.  It 
needs to be larger in diameter on the threaded part.  Looking in one 
RMMW catalog, it lists a # 141 955 517A for 68-72 bus, and 68-71 Bug, 
Ghia and T3 in one catalog,  but another one doesn't list any years 
of bus for the switch.  Bus Depot's site lists it for 68-72 busses 
too.  A #141 955 517 is also listed in  RMMW, fitting 62-67 Bugs, 
Ghias and T3. The pn on the switch in the bus is 141 955 517 - no A.

I thought maybe my 68 had an early style (?) switch with the small 
nut, so I went to the local VW yard today, thinking a later early 
loaf would have the big nut to fit my new switch - I'd just enlarge 
the hole in the dash a bit.  A quick look found a 70 - it had the 
same small nut as my 68.

Can anyone shed any light on this?  I checked the archives with no 
success, and didn't have time to call Bus Depot today.  I'll try them 
tomorrow, I guess.  This has been a real head scratcher.

Thanks
