Subject: Re: [T2] AFM adjustment of spring tension-how?

&gt; &quot;Instead of dealing with all of this ancient fuel injection, I got a
&gt; megasquirt EFI.  Cost me about $120, less than a rebuilt AFM, and I can
&gt; tune my entire EFI with a laptop.  It blows the l-jet out of the water
&gt; and is a breeze to tune compared to the l-jet's &quot;spring tuning.&quot;

Ummm, cost was low, but how many man-hours went into building the unit and
interfacing it to the bus?  The megasquirt is interesting, but it seems to
be just about a hobby unto itself.  It isn't exactly a Heathkit!
