Subject: horn wiring

Help!  The evil PO removed all the stock horn wiring, 
replacing it with a small push-button taped to the side
of the column tube.

1)  Where does the wire from the horn button, that snakes
down through the steering column, go?  Does it hook onto
the rubber coupling disk?  Where does it go from there, and how?

2)  Where does the wire that hooks onto the bottom of the
column tube go? (eventually to ground, I know)
The Bentley shows it going through a loop in the bottom of
the cover plate, but does not hint as to where it goes from there.

Thanks for your input.  : )
