I've had several people ask me:
:  What did you pay for this jewel and is this the one that
:  comes with hydralic lifters?

And the answers are:

- - for the 1600 dual-port stock engine from VW Brazil, various bits of
  tin, an intake manifold, exhaust system (I think it's called an
  extractor, all the headers come into one big pipe, which then bolts
  onto a muffler), and a Pertronix electronic ignition unit, I paid
  somewhere between $1700 and $1800.  Shipping ran about $70 more.

- - there are no hydraulics in this engine.

The Pertronix worked really well when I first got the engine.
Sometime after that is when I discovered the 009 distributor was
frozen, and the vacuum-based replacement is the type with a permanent
post for the points.  The Pertronix effectively has its own post
molded into its case, so it's not removable.  So, I'm back to standard
points.  I may eventually get irritated enough to get another
distributor, but not yet.  I believe the base engine price was
somewhere in the neighborhood of $1400-$1500.

Scat had ads in HVW&amp;DB, VWT, etc, that quoted the price.  I suspect
they still do.
