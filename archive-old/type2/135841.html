&gt; I've seen a few positive comments in this forum on Megasquirt. I 
&gt; visited the

&gt; worked this
&gt; out for our VW bus application?

At least one member has a working Megasquirt in his Bus, and judging 
from his comments in the past, he seems to really like it.

Megasquirt can be a bit intimidating before you get over the learning 
curve, but I certainly wouldn't be *afraid* of it.  I've come away from 
my reading up on it that it's a very good system ... and it's certainly 
inexpensive!

&gt;  Does anyone sell a complete solution?

Define &quot;complete&quot;.  You're going to need some of those D-Jet components 
to use Megasquirt... the plenum (which you'll have to modify slightly; 
it will need to be fitted with the MAP sensor), the intake runners, and 
the injectors themselves (you'll probably want bits of the D-Jet wiring 
harness, too).  Other than that, the Megasquirt web site has info about 
where assembled units can be purchased, I think.
