        I just looked for it and couldn't find it on the sermons page, so I
looked it up in the Vanagon archives. Here's the URL for this particular
one:

Subject: Re: Timing marks question

In a recent message Jonny Miner discovered he had an alien pulley on his
engine and asked how to find TDC.  Once he knew that, he needed to know how
to locate the recommended timing point for his engine, which was 7.5 degrees
before Top Dead Center.

&gt;&gt;Using this system, once I find TDC, how do I know where 7.5BTDC is?

Jonny,

You can figure it out.  The stock VW steel pulley has an outer diameter of
6.995&quot; -- 7&quot; for the arithimetically challenged :-)

Circumference is 2 x pi x the radius or pi x the diameter, which is 21.975&quot;.

There are 360 degrees in a circle and in this case the circle is 21.975&quot;
around so we just divide 360 into 21.975 and we'll get about .06104&quot; inches
per degree.  Multiply that by seven and a half and you've got .4578&quot;.  Round
that to .46&quot; or about 29/64ths of an inch.

Lay that out on a piece of paper or something else you can bend to follow the
contour of the fan pulley and score a mark on the pulley at the 7.5 degree
point, which will be to the right of the TDC mark when you are facing the
pulley..

Easy as pi :-)

PS -- the article on tune-ups is in the archive maintained by Richard Kurtz
(rmk_at_sky_dot_net).  He can direct you to the web page, which he maintains at his
expense.

PPS -- Another way to skin this particular cat is to take a protractor and
some cartridge paper and lay out a degree wheel the same diameter as your
pulley.  Position the paper degree wheel atop your pulley aligned with TDC
and transfer any mark you think you may need onto the pulley.  For example,
total advance at engine speeds above 2,000 rpm should never exceed 32
degrees, so you might want to put a red dot at that point and perhaps a
yellow dot at 28 degrees, a safer number for normal running.

For adjusting your valves it's handy to know Bottom Dead Center, that is, 180
degrees from TDC for #1 cylinder.  The degree wheel will let you locate this
number with confidence.

Don't try holding the paper degree wheel against the pulley, it will only
slip and you'll put the mark in the wrong place.  Glue it to the pulley.
 Seriously.  Cut out the center of the degree wheel so it will fit over the
pulley nut then dob some rubber cement on the pulley, let it get tacky and
press the paper degree wheel onto the pulley, being careful to keep it
aligned with TDC.

We used to do this all the time when dialing in an after-market cam, back
before aluminum degree-wheels were commonly available.  It's old fashioned
but it works, and once you know how to do it you'll never be without a degree
wheel again since you can make one up with just a few minutes work. -- rsh
