&gt; I removed the 'fridge guts from my '78 Westfalia and regained use of that
&gt; deep locker there. The non-Champagne edition Westy's with iceboxes all
&gt; have a nice locker there and now I do again too!

Champagne edition has nothing to do with it. The difference is between
non-deluxe and deluxe Westies. Deluxe comes with the fridge.
Champagne edition buses came as buses and Westies, in non-deluxe and deluxe
versions. Champagne edition buses offered two-tone brown paint, brown
interiors, intermittant wipers, and chrome bumpers.
