&gt; After the problems I have had with my engine this summer (Burning oil like
&gt; an Iraqi dictator bring one of them.) I have decided to rebuild my engine
&gt; this winter.  I was looking at the rebuild kits available at CIP.  My
&gt; current engine is a 1976 2.0 with solid lifters.  I'm looking at two kits.
&gt; One is more or less a stock rebuild at 1915cc and the other is a stroker kit
&gt; that brings the engine up to 2027cc.  I want to run my stock FI system.  It
&gt; works perfectly on my current 2.0 (1915cc).  

are these kits for a type4 engine? the sound more like upright kits.
the two are not interchangable, oh and the 2.0 is actually 2000cc not
1915
  
&gt; My question is this: What kind of performance increase will I get from the
&gt; 2027cc Stroker kit with the stock FI system installed?

It won't matter much since the parts won't fit :)
