Will:
002-141-701 is the part number. Can't imagine that you can't find a new one. Or weld up the old one. Lots of new ones need the welds fixed anyway, so maybe a good shop can fix the old
one if it just broke by the welds anyway.
And, hey, who needs a clutch anyway? Years of driving Vanagons with their hydraulics leaves me releaseless at least once a winter.
Just shut it off to stop, put in first or reverse, use the starter to begin motion. (Avoid stopping totally, if possible!) Match drive and driven gear speeds with the gas pedal after
that and gently ease into gears.
I learned to drive old US built 3 speeds that had no synchro on 1st, so matching gear speeds was something I learned early on.
