&gt; in VW air cooled maintenance it is vacuum, vacuum, vacuum!!!

err... make that fuel, vacuum, compression, spark :-)  Vacuum is one of
the big four, but only one.  And you still need to reset your dwell to 50!

&gt; It was at the gasket on the throttle to the air plenum.  A little Permatex
&gt; on the gasket, and all is well.

Yup, it sure was.  These gaskets get very hard as they age and if they are
disturbed at all they leak like a sieve.  I have had this problem before
and should have seen it sooner but when Barry said the EGR filter was not
installed, I suspected that system first.

The cone gasket is still available from VW for under $5 and *must* be
replaced if disturbed.  Our permatex fix worked, but I am not a big fan.

&gt; PS.  It was funny to see Steve step back 15 feet from the rear of the '78
&gt; when I pulled out this starting fluid spray can, and then later, see him
&gt; actually spraying on the throttle body AFTER we fixed the vacuum leak.  He
&gt; is now also a believer.

Yes and no... I *HATE* starting fluid.  It is way too flammable and in
anything like an enclosed area (like your engine compartment) can be
deadly.  It works, but it's dangerous.

&gt; Newby's, you heard it before, and I heard it for the last few years, vacuum
&gt; leaks are bad news.

AMEN!  Buy a vacuum gauge, use it.  The minimum vacuum reading you want is
15&quot;.  16-17&quot; is far better.

&gt; The starter fluid really works!!

&gt; I am going back over
&gt; the '78 to check ALL my fitting. Maybe I can get the 16 vacuum up to 18!!

I think that if you reset the dwell to 50 exactly and the timing to 7.5
vor that your vacuum will rise to 17&quot; and that that is the highest you
want to go.  You can get it up to 19-20 by advancing the timing per
american V-8 timing specs (advance it til it stumbles, then back off a
hair), but you will burn your engine right up.  VWs have, by american V-8
standards, very retarded timing, but this is necessary to prevent damage
to the engine.  Try to get it to 17&quot; and steady, then rest and be happy.

&gt; Thanks, Steve.

You are welcome, Barry.  Thank YOU for the AFM and ECU!

&gt; PPS. The throttle gasket leak developed from my changing the spark plugs so
&gt; often.  I always removed the 'S' tube from the throttle body.     When I
&gt; tightened the 'S' tube bottom clamp, I pushed the Phillips screw driver hard
&gt; against the clamp's screw while I turned the driver, to be sure I got a
&gt; good, tight fitting.  I did not realize that I was also pushing against the
&gt; throttle.  Perhaps this was why I noticed a worsening of running with each
&gt; successive spark  plug change (three in 6 months).

Yup.  As I said above, they get old, they get hard, and any movement will
create a leak.  If it had been daytime, we'd have been at VW buying a new
one.  Wait til you see where that RTV has gone in your throttle body! :-(
