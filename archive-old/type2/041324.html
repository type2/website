Subject: Hello and FS '79 Adventurewagen

Hello;
My name is Tim, I live in San Carlos, CA. which is half way between San 
Francisco and San Jose.  I own a '71 Westy and a '79 Adventurewagen.  I've 
owned and driven, as a daily driver, my '71 for seventeen years, it has 
289,000 MI's on it.  I've done almost all the work on it myself.
I haven't posted on the list before (although I've tried a few times) I have 
however responded to a few posts with what I hope was some helpful 
information.  I'm sure some of you will recognize my name.
I also was the first person to respond to the &quot;Sway-Away Blow Out&quot; that was 
so popular a few weeks ago.  I now have sway bars on my '71.  They make a big 
difference, for the better, in handling and stiffen the ride very slightly.  
But I think the best thing about sway bars is the car is more stable and 
controllable.
I also have a '79 Adventurewagen that I'd like to find a good home for.  I 
bought it from the original owner.  He had collapsed a valve seat and parked 
it under a big pine tree in front of his house where it sat for about 10 
years.  The car was surprisingly unmolested when I bought it. (76,000 
original MI's)
If you're not familiar with this type camper; it's a bubble top with a cute 
little aerodynamic tail and rear window.  It sleeps 4, two in the bubble top 
and two in the conventional place over the engine.  It has an electric (12VDC 
and 120VAC) refrigerator, two burner propane stove, propane space heater, 
approximately 20 gallon pressurized and filtered water supply system, sink 
with gray water storage tank, a table with a removable leaf, and LOTS of 
inclosed storage space above the front seats.  The car is Green and beige 
with a dark brown interior.  The curtains are original and usable.
If anyone is interested please email me and I'll send digital photos and give 
you all the details.  I'm motivated to sell this little gem and will give 
list members or people referred to me by members a break on my price of 
$3,200.  This is a very good price for an exceptionally clean and virtually 
rust free car that you could do an around the country tour in with 
confidence.
