I remember the Wal-Mart episode!
But I do think that they were more worried about us being fans of some superstar
concert that was happening in North Carolina at the same time,,
I didn't recognize the name of the group, but apparently there was a LARGE group
of hippies heading to a concert in that area,, and seemed to have an undesirable
reputation with the &quot;older&quot; folks

There was another fellow on our tour that was not impressed with a large group
of &quot;Hippies&quot; taking over his parking lot... 
roughly the same section of Hwy,,,

&gt; &gt; Darn, EB02 was gonna relocate to Walmart so we could all camp for
&gt; &gt; free :) Maybe Kmart will host us.

&gt; &gt; &gt;I have heard Wally Mart allows camping in some of their parking lots
&gt; &gt; &gt;but maybe that is just an urban legend.

&gt; &gt; &gt;On our way to Everybus this year, Wal Mart security freaked out when
&gt; &gt; &gt;our caravan of 11 buses rolled into their parking lot!
