Subject: Re: front beam interchangibility

Hi Volks!

&quot;Snoopy&quot; &lt;waitejj_at_musc_dot_edu&gt; wrote to the List:
&gt; Front beams-- Does any one know which years will fit into a 77?
&gt; I can get one from a 79 or a 73 and was wondering if it mattered?

'73-'79 model years are interchangeable, but '79 got
softer (progressive) springing.  If that '73 really
is one, and not a '72 (one year off isn't that unusual),
the '73 would be more original.  As to what's more
desireable, I can't say -- never rode in a '79 yet.

The above applies to German models.  Whether it's the
same on US models is unknown to me; I however think
it is.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
