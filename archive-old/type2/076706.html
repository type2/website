Subject: solid/hydraulic swap?

gang,

matty here. i have a question. right now i have a 2.0
FI type IV engine in my bus. however, as it is a 76,
it has solid lifters, i do not like this. i plan to
replace this engine with a 78, specifically for the
hydraulic lifters. what i'm wondering is, would it be
possible for me to rebuild the 76 engine, and just
swap the solid lifters for hydraulics. can this be
done? if so, it would sure make my life a lot easier.

if not, then i need to find a 78 or 79 engine that i
can rebuild, running or not. anyone got one? the
cheaper the better, as long as it IS REBUIDABLE!

later-matty
