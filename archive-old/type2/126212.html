Too many broken autos... You should just scrap them. Send 'em to me and I will see that they get properly recycled. Be sure you send the signed titles too of course. &lt;grin!&gt; 

If it rattles really bad at startup and the noise starts suddenly, it may be the flex plate holes have broken out. I bought a little FWD car once with that very problem. It got loose and the owners kept driving it. It got worse and they did not fix it. Eventually one of the corners broke out and the other two did also soon after. I got it CHEAP but I knew what I was getting into.

Screwed up the seals on the tranny/torque converter but did not hurt the torque converter. I had to buy a new flex plate and bolts, and drop the whole mess to fix it. $25 to fix it with a new seal, new tranny fluid, and a used flex plate and bolts. I did the tranny filter too so that actually pushed the fix over $25.
