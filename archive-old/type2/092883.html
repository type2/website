My personal opinion is that an oil pressure gauge is the best way to keep 
track of oil temperature.  If I had to have only one gauge, oil pressure 
would be it.

&gt;Despite the wide selection of gauges to be had, it is easy to run out of 
&gt;space to place them or making the dash look like an airplane cockpit.

You say that like it's a bad thing.  :)
