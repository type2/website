One of a few problems - either electrical, physical, or some force we can not
begin to understand.  On the '79 with the FI, if it just started this problem
- especially after playing in the engine compartment - I would say a vacuum
line is loose - check the brake booster line (on the left of the air
distributor), also check all the big lines that run around the air distributor
and the airflow meter.  

Electrical - the '79 was much simpler than earlier FIs, so just check all your
connections - to the &quot;brain&quot; (in front of the battery), to the air-flow meter
(in front of the meter), and a tricky one is to the head temperature sensor
(near cyl. #3).

My guess is that should do it -
