Sorry Scott,

    No Zing meant, its is just that some people don't realize that a good
example of a restored bus is worth $12,000.00 or more.
    At one time there was a dealer in Texas, that was buying &quot;rust belt&quot;
Volkswagens of all kinds, packing the mud to them and making a killing. He
has since taken his short term money and gone on the greener pastures.
    Look close, don't buy over the phone, don't buy at night, don't buy in
the rain, don't buy because you &quot;just have to have that car&quot;, and last don't
buy on the first visit!
    Good luck, let us know what you find.
