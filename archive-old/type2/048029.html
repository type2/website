Subject: [T2] Bright lights

Dear List,

Just after I installed new bright Bosch headlights  (and overloaded my
underdash wiring because I didn't know about the relay)  the &quot;bright&quot; switch
in my turn signal stopped clicking when I lifted it.  Needless to say, I
haven't seen the high beam function yet.  While reading the Bus Depot
catalogue, ( this IS a hobby, afterall) I noticed a part for 68-69 called,
&quot;headlight dimmer relay&quot;.  I'm ignorant electrically, hence this question:
IS that part what allows me to switch from low to high beams ?  If yes,
could I have burned it out when I turned on the new lights without their
required relay (it was too hot to touch under there )?

This is a 68 Kombi, the turn signals and high beam switch are together in
one on the steering column.

Thanks for insight and advice,
Jody
