Subject: electronic ignition and a heat exchanger?

  What do people think about the bosch electronic ignition systems.  Are 
they worth the $100 jcwhitney is asking?  I have a 1973 bus with a 1800 
(with dual carbs) in it, and have trouble starting on occasion. I was 
thinking someone out there has either tried or has one of these systems in 
there bus.  So, if you have, give me a shout out with your beef.

   By the way, anyone got a used right side (passenger side) heat exchanger 
for a 72-74 for sale. I am a college student and can't afford a new one, 
plus it's the only part left for me to &quot;theoretically&quot; have heat again. Have 
some cash, would pay shipping.  Let me know if you gots what I needs.

Peace
