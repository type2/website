&gt;So what is the best radio setup for a 1971-1979 bus??
&gt;

Plop in a BlauPunkt AM/FM/SW from many Audi/VW/Porsche of the same era.
Won't have to cut the dash. Won't have to splice and solder the wires.
Won't have to figure out the rear mount. Stick with stock and it will be
easy to install and function as intended. Don't forget to grab an original
German Harrada antanae to go with it. New Harrada's are marked,
&quot;Manufactured by Harrada of America, Made in China&quot;. 

As a side benefit to infrastructure, it will not fracture the steel
reinforced concrete curbs as you idle through the 'hood.

Get a junk yard candidate fer cheap. Campbell-Nelson will have a bunch. If
it needs service, Wilford Wilkes can make it like new for you. You will
find him in Hemming's and perhaps on the net?? He restores Telefunken,
BlauPunkt and Becker. 

That's just the objective of my need for simplicity and function, and all
at the same, harmonious, long time. Objectives vary as to individuals
unless they accept the original design objectives of they who designed and
built it. That's a systematic approach to what is &quot;best&quot;. Those of the
subjective approach must design the swap themselves to function as they
deem &quot;best&quot; or suffer functional problems, therefore, lost value. If
time/money has to fit under your &quot;best&quot; umbrella, stock is the only logical
choice.
