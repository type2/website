In a message dated 99-06-07 23:12:29 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; recently  rebuilt, new or replaced engines. often these have less than 5000
 &gt;miles on them. am i being paranoid, or is this something to be suspicious
 &gt;of? &gt;&gt;
What's worse is that I've seen a lot of ads that say rebuilt engine with 5000 
miles (or less), and end with &quot;not running&quot;.         Jeff S.
