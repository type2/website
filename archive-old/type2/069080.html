Swap meet.  Or a buddy who'll let one go.  I don't know of anyone who repros
them.

What you need:

Pulley nut: has 2 notches with ramps, so you can only turn it one way.  It
pushes the crank away when the motor catches.

Rear apron: has a slot with a larger hole in the middle: =0= to fit the
crank into.  Its also reinforced around the hole, because it has to support
some of the weight of cranking.  Only fits '55-'66 - barndoors have the same
thing, but the apron is different.

Rear tin:   has a little window with a spring-loaded cover to lift up and
put the crank thru.  This pieces is really the only part that can be improvised.

Crank:      about 2 feet long or so, with 2 90 degree bends.  The part where
you put your hand has a &quot;bushing&quot; so it will spin.

As a set, be prepared to pay $75-$150, depending on condition.  Make sure
you test-fit the crank and nut before buying: a lot of them are roached.
And check the conditon of the slot in the apron: most I've seen are
thrashed, which would be a major bitch to fix.

I got the nut for free, paid $20 for the crank, $20 for the apron (slot
good, rest of apron thrashed) and improvised the tin.

Worth its wait in gold when you have a starter problem.  There's been a few
times now I kicked myself for not having installed it yet!
