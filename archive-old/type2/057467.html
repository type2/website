   Well, that used to be true, but most inverters these days are much
more efficient, more like 94%, and are pretty quiet. The Trace
inverters, for example, only use .045 amps at idle for the 1500-3600
watt models, and only .017 amps for the 800 watt model -- they also have
pretty good sine wave control now, so you don't have to be afraid of
ruining your computer monitor. 8-) And, of course, you can turn it all
the way off too, if you aren't using it. 

&gt; 
&gt; You'd probably be better off to just get fans, lights, etc. that run
&gt; on 12V. RV folks use lots of that stuff.
&gt; 
    True, for most stuff. You can buy those groovy little halogen desk
lamps, for instance, and cut off the 110v adaptor and just run them on
12v. Hey, when we lived off-grid for 17 years, for a long time we just
used 12v taillight bulbs for lights. Plenty good enough to read by. 
    OTOH, I just picked up a little DEC Multia computer, not much bigger
than a laptop but with a Alpha cpu, and I want to install it in my bus.
There's two ways to go -- an inverter, or hacking a DC-DC conversion to
bypass the regular power supply. That's easy enough to do, but then I'm
still left with powering the monitor, and that's not so easy to do
DC-DC. If LCD screens weren't so expensive I'd rather have one of those,
and maybe DC would be simpler too.
