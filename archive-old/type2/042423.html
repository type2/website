Hey.

    You know that feeling you get when you decide it's time for another
VW, and you see one that's perfect for you, and you really really like
it, and it's nearly in your price range?

    Do you then, also know the feeling you get when you finally get a
hold of the guy, and it's sold?

    Here's my deal.  It was a 1972 campmobile.  Blue and white.
Wonderful high top.  From NC, no rust.  Also, no interior from the
driver's seat back.  Engine ran nice, so I hear.  Was $1650 when i last
saw it.

    So, I want a high top.  There's one around, but it's rusty and has
the wrong engine.

    So, does anyone have a high top they want to get rid of for cheap
that has a good engine and rust free body?  And can be delivered to my
door, or at least driven home, from no farther than half a day's drive
away?

    All together now:  YEAH RIGHT!!

        Ok then.  Just had to ask.  We need a therapy group for this
sort of thing.  In my mind, it's already next summer, and I'm in
colorado in that bus.
