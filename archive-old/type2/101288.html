&gt;The VDO sender for a temp gage is only about 15$ and even cheaper of you
&gt;go to a wrecking yard and get a sender from a VW, Audi, Porsche.
&gt;Or buy a set of gages from me .Buy these gages with the senders: $70.00,
&gt;Add $5.00 for delivery.
&gt;Oil Temp, Oil Pressure and the senders.

I just put a cyl head temperature sensor on the 2.0L that I'm
preparing for my Vanagon. The sensor is the one that comes with the
VDO gauge and goes on the spark plug hole.

I am not familiar with the other types of heads, but the 2.0L head
such that you'll have to bend the sensor ring properly otherwise you
won't be able to screw in the spark plug. The risk is that the plug
might not sit properly in the hole.
