Subject: Re: [T2] Hydraulic Lifters


It wouldn't hurt to adjust them but it probably wont solve the problem. Sounds like you have a lifter that isn't holding it's prime. Not a problem as long as it pumps up quickly, say within a minute or two. Some folks try things like MMO to clean out
the lifters but I think if they don't pump up quick enough they should be removed and properly cleaned and primed before reinstallation.

&gt; I have an 82 Camper with Type 4 engine.  Do the hydraulic lifters ever need adjustment on this motor or should I leave well alone?  They work well except 1 of them, (don't know which), is noisy when first started up after a few days sitting idle.
