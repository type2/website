Hi,

 

I was putting in the new Robert Bosch spark plug wires yesterday.

 

I nicked one very badly and I nicked one just a bit. The other just
slightly.

 

The one I nicked badly I could braid inside while I installed it.

 

I was trying to get it into the holder below the oil breather.

 

The holder for this one is bigger than the new wires.

 

So, am I hooped or is there anything I can do to fix this.

 

Stupid thing is inches away from the fuel rail.
