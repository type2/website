Subject: Passed! And passed well!

Peregrine passed emissions. Although I was going to go this morning, the 
rain hadn't quite cleared and -- since there's a big bald spot of bare 
steel where I am working on the roof rust -- I thought I would keep her 
inside.

Tested this afternoon. Here are the numbers:

at 15 mph

	Max	Ave	Measured
HC	219	67	2		(PPM)

CO	1.66	.021	.07

NO	2191	482	1034

at 25 mph

HC	169	40	0

CO	1.46	.21	.06

NO	1991	569	891


So looks like I need to clean the internal EGR lines in my plenum.

Mark Hineline and his very happy bus, Peregrine
