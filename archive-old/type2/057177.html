Subject: RE: High altitude driving

Rob and All;

We run a 1970 Campmobile with a dead stock 1600 SP, right down to the original 
Solex carb and original distributor.  

We live in Tacoma, WA, on Puget Sound, at an elevation at our home of 325' 
above sea level.  The Campmobile is tuned for optimum operation in our local 
conditions/environment, which means timing at TDC and carb running stock jets 
and mixture.

We routinely travel several times/year over assorted Cascade and Rocky  
Mountain passes ranging up to 5000' or 6000', and have never felt a need to 
retune the bus for high altitude conditions.

A couple of Summers back we (2 adults and a teenager, plus &quot;stuff&quot; and food 
for the whole trip) left Tacoma on a Sunday afternoon bound for Yellowstone NP 
and points North.  After an overnight in Kellogg ID, by 4:00PM Monday we were 
set up in the Mammoth Hot Springs CG.  We subsequently spent 2 full days 
touring Yellowstone, crossing passes in the 8000' to 9000' range.  We then 
drove North to Glacier and Waterton Lakes NPs, crossing more high passes en 
route (we took a roundabout route on &quot;blue highways&quot;).  We left that area by 
crossing the Going To the Sun highway in Glacier NP (another high pass), then 
West through Kalispell MT to Sandpoint ID.  Final leg was from Sandpoint, 
through Spokane to I-90, and we were home in Tacoma by Saturday evening.

On this 1 week trip, an ambitious itinerary in any conveyance, we averaged 
between 20 and 21 MPG on a corrected speedometer/odometer and consumed 1.5 
quarts of 30W Castrol in an engine that was definitely well worn.  Nothing 
broke or fizzled.  I never touched the toolbox or spares the entire trip.

Even though the engine was tuned for sea level we routinely motored right by 
motor homes and other RVs going up the passes, and when the road got twisty 
we'd leave them far behind.

My advice is to not sweat the altitude issue.  We never have in 20 years of 
traveling in Campmobiles, and our home elevation is a lot lower than 
Bartlesville OK.
