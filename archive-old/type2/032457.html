OK, I just spent an hour trying put hub cap retaining clips on one wheel, how in the H#LL do you do this (1970 &amp; earlier 5 lug wide pattern wheels)??  I was trying to pound the little rivot flat on the back that holds the clip and all I have to show is 3 smashed fingers!  Anybody have any tips they'd like to share???
