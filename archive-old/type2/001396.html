Hello listers,
    Belive it or not, a clothespin does work.  I had to use one on my 69 B*g
most all the time.  Haven't had to on my Bus yet, though.
Have a great weekend!

-- I've heard, but never actually tried, that putting wooden clothes
 pins on the fuel line will diffuse the heat &amp; keep the gas from
aporizing in
the lines.

 I'm also skeptical about this fix- I can't see it working.

Cheers,
 W.
