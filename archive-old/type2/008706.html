Hey Y'all,
  I was in a local yard yesturday and was talking to the owner and she
told me that they were about to put a 82 or 84 Vanagon in the yard. This
is a U-pull type place and the prices are really cheap. Like a rear
bumper is only $21.50, carburators are only $8.00. The van looks
complete and real nice, too bad its going to be parted. But I thought
many of you would like to know. The yard is called pull a part in Tacoma
Wa.
Pass this on to the vanagon list too please.
