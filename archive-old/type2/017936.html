Im a Graphic Design student at Central Washington Univeristy. I've owned
Maggie the Magicbus (1970 yellow poptop) since last April. She's had her
good and bad times. I'm a care provider for a disabled student (and also
one of my bestest friends). I still have a lot planned for her 'fore I
can take her rock climbing/camping this summer.
In lieu of Maggie's temporary shortcomings, I drive a GLI (no flames
please).

Love to lurk this list,
Jay Santos
