&gt; Last night on the Simpson's Halloween Special, the first of three that
&gt; night, I think it was a re-run, there was a green on green splittie that
&gt; got crushed by a giant Ken Brockman (I think it was Ken).
&gt; 
&gt; It was only on screen for a second, so I couldn't get more of an ID.
&gt; 

I saw this!  It was the giant neon beer advertising mascot who crushed
the hippies with his gian beer bottle.  Not only did he crush them, he
turned the bottle side to side to really smear 'em good :) 

I love the Simpsons!  Also saw that green VW Thing in the &quot;Who shot Mr.
Burns&quot; outtakes :)
