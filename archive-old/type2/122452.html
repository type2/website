&gt; It appears that whoever bought the kit used whatever seals they needed to

Most of the seals are interchangeable with the bus.

&gt; Without any experience, I wouldn't know if all
&gt; of the bits are there for the remaining cylinders.  Is it worth $60.00 half
&gt; there, or complete?

It's got some value but hard to say. You can take inventory of it by using
my gasket article and seeing what's useful for your bus. Most of the gaskets
are same (intake manifold gaskets won't fit because they are 3 stud).

Or send me pmail and a photo and I'll help you piece it together.
