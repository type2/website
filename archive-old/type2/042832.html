&gt;Nicholas,
&gt;According to the Bentley, you should use a total of 3.2 oz (90g) of grease
&gt;of which 2/3 is packed bewtween the joint and the protective cap (the metal
&gt;flange with 6 holes in it) and 1/3 to pack the open front of the cv-joint.
I
&gt;think if you follow that instruction you will not have enough to also pack
&gt;the boot, nor would you want to do that, at the risk of blowing out the
boot
&gt;by using too much grease.

If yoy put some extra grease into the boot, you can go in every 6 months or
so, give the boot a squeeze, and force more grease into the cv.
