A spreadsheet is not the way to go! The AIRS list should be backed by a 
database with some CGI scripts at the front that let you search on anything 
you want. They should also allow people to edit their own entry using some 
form of authentication. (A password at creation time, or emailed to the 
user are both easy to set up.) It would be really cool to be able to enter 
some information about a trip you are taking and have it give you a list 
for that trip. But with a good search feature people should be able to find 
what they need.

A simple perl script would be able to read the list in it's current form 
into a database in no time at all. I would love to help with such a 
project, but would want to get the okay first so as not to steal the 
current admin's thunder. I have a BS in Computer Engineering, so I think I 
am qualified. :~) I am sure that I could have it up in running in a 
weekend. Beat that time to market!
