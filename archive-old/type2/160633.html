Subject: Sears Tools sale

I swore I didn't need any more tools, but . . .

Sears is selling a 3/8 drive 20 piece set of combined SAE/Metric 6 point
sockets for $19.99    sears_dot_com  34864  You can order them online and get
the shipping rebated.  Thru 6 Sep 06

9 sockets each: SAE 1/4 - 3/4 and metrics 9mm - 17mm

What's so great about these Sears Craftsman??  Well, they are the READABLE
sockets, and you can actually see the sizes engraved on the socket.  They
use to be the Harley-Davidson special sockets.

What's so great about ordering online??  You can send a set off to your kids
/ grandkids in college as a random act of kindness / love / incurred
obligation and save the hassle and cost of mailing.  Of course, you could
wait until they come home to visit, and wait, and wait ...  Boy, do I sound
like a bitter old man??  ... hope so, wouldn't want to leave a wrong
impression.
