&gt;also i noticed while i have the engine out that the gen. pully does not

&gt;of line. i have been thinking about putting a alt. in this bus. will one 
&gt;of the kits fix this problem.
===================&gt;
An alternator kit will fix the problem, however ...........

What you have is the concave mounting tin which is concave so that it will 
align the generator pulley to the crank pulley when a proper bus generator 
is installed. This generator is a bit longer than the bug unit and develops 
a bit more amperage, as well.

Somebody has mounted a bug generator in your bus without retro-installing 
in a flat piece mounting plate so as to put the shorter length bug pulley 
outward a bit more and thus align it to the crank pulley.

Fixes.........
Put in flat plate tin to accommodate your current the shorter bug generator.
or
Put in the longer bus generator.
or
Put in an alternator kit.
