&gt; You have to be carefull with Landrover stuff .. the standard land rover
&gt; pressed steel rims will fit pretty much anything .. But I know that the
&gt; Alloy wheels from Range Rovers will not fit (the hub is too big) .. although
&gt; I cannot think of a reason why you want alloy wheels on a Landrover (or a
&gt; Rangerover for that matter).

   You've obviously never seen a NYC Landie tricked out with the usual
chrome rhino bars and oversized alloys with zero sidewalls and blacked
out windows...(not to mention the stretched Hummers...) It's a jungle out
there... ;-)
