Subject: [T2] Fuel tank:

Sean,

    Bad news here, looks like you may need to pull the tank, and maybe
replace it. If there is enough junk in there that it keeps stopping up the
filters, just changing them wont be enough, it will stop up filters from now
on. Pull the tank, look inside and see how bad the rust is. If it isn't too
thin where the rust is, it can be cleaned with &quot;Muriatic acid&quot;, (Wal-Mart,
couple bucks a gal, you will need about 3 or 4 gals) then treated with a
&quot;Butyl&quot; gas tank sealer. Most motorcycle shops, or automotive supply stores,
$20.00 or so a qt, need about a gal.
    Follow the instructions on the acid very closely, bad stuff. The gas
tank sealer is easy to work with, again follow instructions.
    When finished with the tank, cleaning, or replacing, replace the
filters, clean the whole fuel system, including the injectors, lines, etc.
The pump may be ok, you'll just have to try it. Listen to it, if it makes
any noise, don't take any chances, replace it. Worst case here is that you
may end up having to replace the injectors also, the rust and scale is so
small and you can't take the injectors appart to clean them. So if the
injector cleaning wont do it they will have to be replaced.
    Good luck.
