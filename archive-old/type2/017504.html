Subject: Engine Hesitation

&gt; &gt;I recently purchased a 67 bus with a &quot;new&quot; 1600 DP engine. Although it
&gt; &gt;seemed to run pretty well when warm, it was barely driveable when cold due
&gt; &gt;to a horrendous hesitation (or stumble) at low RPM in each gear.  I was
&gt; &gt;told that the carb (a PICT-34 I think) was new.  It also has a new 009
&gt; &gt;distributor.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; This dizzy/carb combo is legendary for this. Best is to lose the 009 and get
&gt; a real dizzy. One with a vacuum advance. Alternately you can adjust the carb
&gt; to the point that you will get lousy fuel economy and it will run nearly
&gt; okay. 

I disagree. Stick with the 009 its a superior distributor. You don't want to 
have to rely on a vacum advance distributor. 
They're ancient. When using an 009 with a 34.3 there will be a dead stop upon 
shift up through the gears. 
Learn how to drive it best to eliminate that - overlap the clutch with the 
gas pedal a bit more and it will go smoother. 
By the way, the 34.3 is a mediocre carb on its best day fresh out of the box, 
so you might consider switching to a 30pict1 
and an adaptor plate, this will also help your dead spot.
