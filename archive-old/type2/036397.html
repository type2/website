Subject: 009 dist in a 1700

I've read on a couple of lists about the hesitation that the 009 dist gives 
you on take off. The 72 bus I just got and had tuned up by a 30+ year vetran 
of VWs, has this hesitation. It also has the aftermarket Weber progressive 
2brl carb. Does anyone have a better setup for this engine or know what the 
original dist should be? Also, could it be used with the weber setup. Im 
also thinking about going to the electronic setup, but would this be ok in 
the 009 or better to go with the orginal dist. The mechanic also said that 
some of the webers he has seen is the cause of this hesitation and some run 
like a champ. Has anyone ever tried several webers and had this problem with 
one and not the other ?
