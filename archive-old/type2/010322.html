	JT,
	The round numbers are just that- round numbers. 1700 is really 1679, 
1800 is 1795 and 2.0 is 1971cc. Then there are the non-stock configurations,
like 1776, which is a popular over-bore of the 1600, which is realy 15xx of
course.
	VW's 'round number' aircooled displacements were 1100, 1200, 1300, 1500, 
1600, 1700, 1800 and 2000cc. 11-1600 were Type 1/2 cases, the 'upright'
fan shroud style, as found in Beetles and busses through '71 in the USA.
1700 through 2.0 are Type 4 engines, pancake style, installed in busses
from 72 to 83 (early Vanagon). NONE of these engines has the actual
round number displacement in ccs.
	The precise numbers, like 1776, usually indicate aftermarket
bigbore or long stroke or both setups. Unless you're talking with
someone who KNOWS what the actual displacement of a 1600 is and
likes slinging the number around the impress folks. 
	So when in doubt, ask, as you have done.
