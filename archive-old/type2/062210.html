Subject: Re: 1600Dp muffler install on 65' bus?

&gt;I am soon to embark on installing a new (stock) muffler on my 1600Dp bus
&gt;engine (for 65' westy) are there any tricks or thingsthat I should watch
&gt;out for? Or is the install pretty starightforward and self evident?

A couple things:

* get the 12mm copper exhaust nuts: makes it a lot easier to put it on -
more wrench room
* get some anti-sieze stuff and use it liberally
* make sure you have the clamps for between the heater box air intake and
the muffler.  Not the exhaust clamp, but the large, wide band-clamp.  Put it
over the heater box before you mate the muffler to the bus - you'll never
get it on otherwise.
* get all new gaskets (*duh*) but some people forget...
* get new fresh-air tubes
* good time to replace the engince compartment seal in the apron

&gt;Also has anyone had any luck painting a muffler w/ grey paint that actually
&gt;stays on for any length of time. I suppose I good get the muffler powder
&gt;coated or something but that would cost more than a new muffler costs. Do
&gt;most people just give up and let the muffler rust?

Tried some high temp paint from the hardware store.  Some places its worked
like a champ, others its flaked off.  No signs of burning, but it just
didn't stay put.  Maybe if I'd stripped it first or something...
