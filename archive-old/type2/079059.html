Subject: Re: [T2] Stauling Out

Before you take on a car note........ try some fuel additive that removes
moisture from your tank. Its best in Winter months to keep the tank as
near full as possible to reduce in-tank condensation. I use Berryman B12,
about 4 oz per tank.

It only stauls out when I'm at a stop
&gt; sign or something like that and then I try to go.
