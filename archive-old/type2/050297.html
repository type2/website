Subject: Re: [T2] No Quarter on the list

&gt;For starters, I've built a 1776 T1 engine for my bus but I find that I
&gt;could really use more power.  I'm concerned about longevity and it's
&gt;getting to the point where I almost resent adjusting the valves.  I want
&gt;something powerful and reliable and a little easier to maintain so I've
&gt;decided to build a bone stock 2L T4 engine.  I already have new P/C's and
&gt;the pistons are dished.  Dunno what that means.

OK I won't mock but I will say this.  To do a stock 2.0 right you will
be into about the following.  $300 for the P&amp;C's, you got em.  $200-$250
each for heads.  Personally I'd never use a rebuilt head as Reichert has
the new German and you could get them together for about $250 each
outright I figure.  Crank will be $75 or so after you get a core, rods $60
after you get cores, bearings $35 main, $30 rods, $12 cam.  Cam is
going to be $75 for a nice regrind, lifters $100, pushrods, rockers, etc
you need to find nice cores and clean up.  $60 for the gasket set, $40
for the oil pump, $10 for the rear main seal, $5 for the nose seal.  Then
you would need a set of the proper tin (a bit tough but Bus Depot had
new and they float around for much less.)  Nikki would get you a set
of exchangers for $100, $100 for a nice muffler, and then you need some
sort of induction which would be say $250 for a solid used Weber (ugh)
or about the same for a working FI setup, then $50 for a late FI gas
tank and whatever hassles to make that fit so the Weber is likely how to go.

So to do it so it will last at least 75k miles or so, I'd figure $1000 in
parts
alone with your jugs to do JUST the engine after getting core stuff and
pushing $2000 by the time you find tin, induction, exhaust, rectify clutch
and bellhousing issues and anything else that would creep up.

I've driven a number of 1776 early bays with engines built well.  Running
even a stock 34 PICT or certainly dual Kadrons they were about equal
heavier late bays and easily had 75k mile lifespans or better.

Doesn't seem sensible to me, just one opinion.  A T4 doesn't get built
on the cheap.  And putting one into a non T4 bus just doesn't make
much sense effort wise for the benefits IMHO.  $2000 would build a hell
of a type 1 even in a new case, with hydraulic lifters, done right.
