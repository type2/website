You might want to use a screwdriver instead of the pencil.  Less
likely to fall completely inside the cylinder!

The screwdriver is remarkably sensitive for this as it will lever
itself up at an angle as the piston reaches TDC.  A very small
movement of the piston will result in a large movement of the
screwdriver handle.

Be sure to turn the engine only by hand while doing this, and _don't_
force anything.  If you feel any sudden resistance, you're probably
trying to bend the screwdriver.  Pull the screwdriver a bit more out
of the hole before proceeding!
