Subject: Keeping engine cool and the EGR valve

I just recently came across a list posting called, &quot;A guide to overheating (1st draft)&quot;.  I'm relatively new to my stock 1980 Westfalia, but I'd really like to keep it running at the right temperature.

The PO had a trashed, foam engine compartment seal half way around the compartment.  I've since installed a stock-style rubber replacement.  Something seems odd, though.  With the seal installed, there is still a gap in some places.  Do I need to bend the tin until I can't see daylight?  It's particularly bad on the forward-most (of the vehicle) firewall where the accelerator cable comes in.

The EGR valve is mentioned for its effect on temps.  The PO of my van did not replace the stock &quot;U&quot; shaped pipe going from the crossover pipe to the muffler where the EGR filter connects.  Instead, he had two beetle exhaust parts welded together.  Now the EGR pipe from the filter is just hanging there.  I would like to replace the &quot;U&quot; (can this still be purchased?  PO mentioned a ridiculously high price being the reason for not staying stock), but until then, should I disable it?  How should it be done (at EGR filter or at air intake)?

Thanks in advance,

John Haddad
