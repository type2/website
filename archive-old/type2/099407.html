Subject: Re: [T2] Excellent tune up

This is exactly what I'm getting at. For a little more money than junk, you 
can get durable high quality best brand name products. Fluke is not the 
only good manufacturer, but considered best by the most qualified 
professional users. The Snap On unit could well be Snap On specs build for 
them by Fluke, or Beckman or Techtronix.

&gt;Yep,
&gt;I just looked at the big auction site by the bay and see Snap-on in a padded
&gt;case sold for less than $40.
