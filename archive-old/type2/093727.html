Subject: Re: [T2] Question for you'ze guys

[...]
are we talking pre vanagon or a vanagon westy.  the vanagon westy does 
not get
as good gas milage  with all the extra weight.  15 to 17 is what i get 
at average of  65 mph  at  this altitude.
  I found i do get a little better milage when i go down lower.  In a  
few weeks i will find out some more on a  little  longer trip to  hunt 
some wild chili peppers.

&gt; Depends on your speed, headwinds, and the terrain.
&gt; My 77 deluxe Westy will get around 20-22 if I feel like cruising at 
&gt; 65. But I
&gt; normally run all day at 80-85 so it drops considerably. Somewhere 
&gt; around
&gt; 15-17. I average 200 miles to a tank
