Subject: Re: [T2] Bolts needed to attach pressure plate to 215mm
  flywheel

Greg, are not the bolts you are talking about
8X125X45mm, about a inch long. Should be able to get
them at Lowe's or Home Depot in the automotive Bolt's
section of hardware. I got some here but it would take
a week or longer to send them. Phil ( Easley, SC.)
