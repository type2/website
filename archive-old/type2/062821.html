Subject: Re: Deluxe Micro Middle Seat

I have a late 50s deluxe seat (its red with Ivory grab handles across the 
top) in my parts collection. This seat does have the fold down part on the 
right hand side of the seat to allow access to the rear. I'm not sure, 
however, if later busses had the same.
