Subject: Re: [T2] Trans gear oil replacement

I use a Turkey Baster with a 12&quot; hose extension (you won't need the
preparation H with the baster).
Home made 17mm tranny plug wrench.

&gt; &gt; Can someone tell me where the gear oil fill opening is on a 71

&gt; top of the transmission). After exensive archive research I found 
&gt; that I should use GL-4 90 weight oil, but not the specifics of 
&gt; changing it.  I also had no luck finding this info in my Bentley.
&gt; 
&gt; it is on the side of the tranny, uses a really big allen wrench to 
&gt; remove.
&gt; 
&gt; oil goes in until it just reaches the fill hole
&gt; 
&gt; I use a enema syringe to put the oil in.  cheap at the local drug 
&gt; store,
&gt; and you get the enema as a bonus, of course a used one works just as 
&gt; well
&gt; when cleaned ;8*?
