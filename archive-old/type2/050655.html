&gt; Basically, after experiences travelling around in the bush and blowing 2 tires

&gt; hardtop, both from the top-heavy and the rack-held-on-by-rain-gutters-and-straining-them
&gt; perspective.

I carry a spare on my rack and don't think that it's too much.  The rack
is rated at 200 pounds and the spare is pretty much all that I carry up
there.  Keeps it up and out of the way of thieves.
