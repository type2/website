&gt; I'm looking at installing my '78 engine and manual transmission in a bus 
&gt; that has an automatic transmission in place.  How hard is it to change a bus 
&gt; from auto setup to manual?  What all is involved?  Would I need everything 
&gt; from the shifter itself, the shifter linkage, all bushings, shift coupler?

what year is the auto tranny bus, 78??  (what kind of shape is the tranny
in??, where are you located??)

there is a lot more to it than first appears.  besides the engine and
tranny some things that need to be dealt with.
. clutch, and linkage
. all shift linkages
. need the shaft for the shift linkages
. different front tranny mount
. different accelerator linkages
. different ECU (this doesn't appear to matter unless you are in Calif)
. different half shafts, the auto tranny axles are different lengths

&gt; I don't want to yank all this out of my current bus.  In a perfect
&gt; world, I'd have 2 bus bodies with only 1 engine to maintain.

in a perfect world I'd have two engines and trannies and one bus ;8*}

it's a lot of work and requires some welding...
good luck
