Subject: Bus Depot baywindow sliding windows?

Hey there guys,

I've been off of the list for awhile, but I've been reading posts daily for 
awhile again.  I went to Ron's website to see the 'specials' he's got going 
right now, and I see(or don't see) that the sliders are gone.  Did Ron 
announce this, and if he did, did any of you guys grab extras?!  I contacted 
BD and Karen tells me that they have no plans to replace them.  What do I do 
now?   Start scroungin' for used ones again?  Are the replacement seals 
still available, and if so - through whom?

Eron
