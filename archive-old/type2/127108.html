Subject: RE: [T2] Overheating? How can you tell?

Maybe your idle is set high, or your pressure sender has a slightly lower setpoint. I only see this at temps significantly above 220*F
 
I assume your light comes on before engine start...

It just means the oil pressure is slightly below the senders threshold pressure. As long as the light clears when you rev the engine, should be ok.

Older worn engines may have more tendencie to do this.
