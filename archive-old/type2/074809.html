Subject: Re: [T2] Themostats for pancakes (available again??)

I know that they were still available from VW for $50.00. Did you by

what the price was going to be?

&gt; I went by the Flaps and had a nice conversation with the lovely Glenda.  We
&gt; were talking about the thermostats for pancakes and she called up a couple
&gt; of her dealers.  One said they had 100 coming in this week and the other
&gt; said they had 150 coming in...  Is someone new repoping these?
