&gt; &quot;I was also told by a shop in British Columbia that they are not a good
idea in the mountains. You go down a long &quot;hill&quot; rev with the rev limiter
kicked in.  Two things happen. First the unburned gas washes the oil off
your cylinders and rings causing increased wear. Second your exhaust system
fills with gas, and at the bottom of the hill when spark starts again this
unburned gas blows your exhaust system off. Just what I was told.  The guy
discovered one on a bus while I was there, and he quite violently ripped it
off, threw it outside, and stomped it into the dirt!&quot;

Whoever rides their engine down hills at over 5400 rpm (the slowest rev
limiting rotor I know of) deserves to blow their bloody engine!  Yes, those
things would happen if you were goofy enough to do exactly that but... come
on.  Blaming the rotor for that problem is as stupid as blaming the
transmission for being able to try and go up those same mountains in 4th
gear at thirty miles an hour with the pedal mashed to the floor.  Damn those
tranny's!  They'll ruin your engine!  Hee, hee!  ;-)  I guess it's
automatics for all of us now!
