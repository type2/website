Subject: RE: [T2] Ohhh, man... I'm soooo nervous!

Come on Don,you know that rust is gonna come back sooner or later! ;)

Seriously, I need to seal up my bus too. I was completely missing my rear 
hatch seal so I used that foam weather stripping from Home Depot, seems to 
be working fair. That freaking seal is $70 new, cost maybe $10 to seal up 
rear hatch and engine compartment with the stuff from Home Depot.

I plan on using the same stuff and sealing all the doors with it, hoping 
that can keep water out for awhile until I'm rich and famous and can afford 
brand new GERMAN seals. Maybe you want to consider this route too.
