&gt;&gt;On the passenger side, I found a small grey plate mounted at 90 degrees and
again not with the details I'd expected. On it are the following rather
cryptic set of digits:
52 064 767
J6J651 A41 123
49 4 7042 EN 2140 11
Anyone got any idea what these mean?&lt;&lt;

Paul,
Yep, This is your M-code plate.  It will tell you everything you need to know about your bus including date of manufacture, original options installed, paint color, interior color, and even the Port to which it was imported. Goto Everett's http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw and you can find the information link that will lead you to a site to decipher these codes.  If you can't find it there, I think ther is also a link on Thoms vintagebus_dot_com
