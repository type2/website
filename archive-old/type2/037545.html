&gt; I simply have to ask... Why not just replace the Bowden tube?
&gt; 

:O) and I simply have to answer -- it was a field repair, done in a limerock
parking lot at work.  I'm not sure what you mean by flex tube - the cable
conduit in my bus is rigid and spot-welded in at least 2 places along its
length.  Although, being a Gator, had I known it is called a Bowden tube, I'd
have gotten rid of the darn thing anyway  ;O)  Are ya listening, Joe?  Hey,
it's Friday ..
