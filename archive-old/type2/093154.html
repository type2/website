Subject: Re: [T2] Window Felt Install?


&gt;The body shop that painted my bus took the felt strip out of the passenger 
&gt;door. It broke while out. I'm finally getting around to putting it back. I 
&gt;ordered the felt from WCM. Looks like good stuff (but what do I know??). 
&gt;What I didn't know was that I need several clips to hold the thing in.
&gt;
&gt;The clips are not there. I called the body shop, they deny taking them out 
&gt;and have no idea where they might be.
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone know where to find these clips?
&gt;
&gt;Is this a big job?

Get the clips from a junk door. Requires a screwdriver to slide them 
forward or backward a bit and then they fall out.

I put them in place in my door add a little more squeeze, and then install 
the new felt strip with my hands and sometimes with a light tap from a 
rubber mallet.

Not alot of info but if you have questions, holler back at me.
