Pfft. You think you have problems. When I discovered that my camshaft 
was broken, the bus was in a rented garage. Unfortunately, the landlord 
was the University of California and they decided they'd give me a $50 
ticket every day until the bus was registered and smogged. So I bought 
a house, but had to build a garden shed in order to make enough room in 
my garage to pull the engine. I'm flashing and roofing the shed today.

All told, I suspect it's costing me upwards of $350,000 to rebuild this 
engine. Mostly borrowed, of course.

Mark &quot;but when I get the engine rebuilt, I will have heat&quot; Hineline
