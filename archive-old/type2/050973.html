Subject: [T2] Por 15 in canada

what part of canada are you in? Here in winnipeg the local body shop
supply store sells all of the por 15 products, there is a place in
Ontario that will send it to you - they seem like quite nice people but
they were too slow for my tastes - the name of the shop escapes me but
if you look around the por 15 web page - or maybe even
http://campbellsauto.hypermart_dot_net/ check these guys out
