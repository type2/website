Subject: Charging problem

Hi folks,

Got a little problem that's been getting worse.

My '60 single cab is 12v with a dynamo. With a charged battery (that's
brand new) it starts just fine.
Generator light goes out straight away and never come in even under load
(light, wipers, etc.). When I got
for a long'ish drive stop, and try to start it again the battery is dead
- and it's really dead  i.e. it's not a heat
related thing.

So since the bus runs fine when it's going, I figure the dynamo is
putting enough current out because the
charge light  goes out. Leads me to the regulator. Now I've never sat
down and worked out what the
regulator actually does. So my request is this: Does anyone have a
working description of the regulator ?
so I can digest it. and/or have we seen this problem and know the
solution ?


Secondly Bug Freeze, bunch of us went in a bus convoy and I only spent 7
quid:  2 quid on an unopended
60's tin of Genuine brake fluid (sad eh?) and a cab door panel off a '58
firetruck - 5 quid. Excellent day
out, I saw loads of bus buddies and won runner-up in the concours for my
pickup - cool!

Lee.
