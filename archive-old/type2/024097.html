Does anyone have any information on AVP engines. I have a 72 transporter with 
a dropped valve seat and I am considering a rebuilt engine.  I am not really 
sure what my options are.  The manuals I have say to get a new cylinder head 
and pistons.  Does this sound correct?  If you have dealt with this situation 
please advise.
