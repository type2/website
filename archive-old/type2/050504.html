Subject: [T2] Axle Beam Replacement

Hello Everyone,

      Well I worked all day yesterday on body work, today I decided it was
time to face the cold hard fact: if my '77 Westy is going to Everybus 2001
it ain't going on the front beam that's on it now. 
The backside of the beam has holes big enough to put your fingers in, and
the lower tube has separated. I've read Steve Dolans write up on beam
replacement at least two dozens times, and Bentley covers it as well
(although they make it sound pretty damn simple). This first PITA today was
removing the heater tube, these things develop quite a set after 20+ years!
Once that was done, parking brake cables were a snap, less than five
minutes. Now the shift rod, one very important step here, trans must be in
first or third gear, I knew this yet forgot it, and finally remembered
after about 20 minutes of fiddling around with it. Had to bolt the shift
lever back in, put it first, took it back out, shift rod came right out.
Now the drag link had to be removed from the relay lever. This nearly
brought me to tears! I had to remove the sway bar in order to get my gear
puller in place. Then I cranked and I cranked and finally a loud POP! and
it had broken free. At this point I quit for the day, tomorrow the brake
booster  comes off, then the beam (call me crazy, but I'm gonna try to do
it by myself) I'll try to get some pictures posted by the end of the week.

PS-yesterday I pulled the luggage rack off the roof, and there were the
wasps (I had mistaken for yellow jackets) About 100 wasps nesting under the
luggage rack! I'm glad they're gone!
