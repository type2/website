Subject: $$ deposit for Mexico travel

Hey all,

Waited for friday and now I've lost the news article, but....

Since listmembers often go to mexico, especially in winter (based on
trip reports) I wanted to pass on some info that I read in the paper.

In an effort to cut down on illegal car smuggling into mexico, the
mexican authorities are requiring a deposit for vehicles when entering
the country.  Something like - $800 for a '99-2000 vehicle, $600 for an
84-99, and $400 for a &lt;84 model.

I don't know if they have done this all along, but I wanted to pass it
on so someone doesn't get a wrench thrown in their trip.  As always -
check the details out for yourself , but I think - Cash or charge is
accepted, and one mexican state &amp; maybe Baja is exempt.
