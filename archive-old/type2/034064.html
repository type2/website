Subject: Re: jumpering a fuse

&gt;

&gt; I will remind you that there is a potential several hundred amps
&gt; available in the circuit

Not on any car I ever saw. What are you driving ?


&gt; and there are a hell of a lot better ways to
&gt; look for an electrical  problem than shorting the fuse.

We're not discussing shorting a fuse. I don't think you understand what you
are discussing. We're not shorting anything.

&gt; If you had a probem in your house would you jump out the breaker panel to
&gt; eliminate the breaker as the cause?

If the circumstances called for it but you're exaggerating so never mind.


&gt; I feel as if you gave bad and possibly dangerous advice more
&gt; dangerous to the people who are not so well versed in electronics.

Now you're just being silly.

&gt;
&gt; Ive worked in electronics for over 20 years and still wouldnt advise
&gt; someone else to jumper out a fuse. Of course I have done it on myself and
&gt; watched the smoke, more than once.

You should have tested the amp draw but that's another topic I don't think I
want to get into..


&gt; this is getting a waste to keep posting.

You're right there.
