Subject: canvas

happy thanksgiving! I am still searching for the canvas canopy for my
single cab. VW CANVAS inTexas no longer makes them. they are just doing
westy and poptop stuff. if anyone knows anybody who is selling an
original or repro canopy please let me know. 

also has anyone purchased and installed the new gery fiberboard panels
from wolfsburg west? if so how do they look and fit? especially the
headliner panels they are really hard to duplicate. 

any info on these subjects greatly appriciated

thanks
