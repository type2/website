Hi Todd,

&quot;VERY&quot; must mean something different where you come from.

Up here we don't think it's cool until our keg freezes. THEN the 
whining starts....

Happy trails,

&gt; Definitely.. I think I've been to that campground in Bahai Honda. Or 
&gt; was it
&gt; Knights key? I was dating an older woman at the time, (Denise : I was 
&gt; 19,
&gt; she was 35) and we camped out in an actual tent there for almost a 
&gt; week.. it
&gt; was VERY cool at night (like 60-65 from the breeze) and I believe it 
&gt; was
&gt; around this time of year too.
