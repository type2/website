Subject: Re: [T2] Mix in gas tank

&gt; Speaking of odd mixtures in the gas tank, I was told to throw a couple of
&gt; ounces of ATF in (to clean up the deposits from running rich) every other
&gt; tank of gas.  I swear it did seem to run better after I did this, althougth
&gt; I haven't pulled it apart to see if it actually cleaned anything up.

repeat after me,  &quot;gas goes in the engine, ATF goes in the auto tranny!&quot;

gas port is on right side of bus behind sliding door
ATF port is near left lower firewall inside engine compartment

&gt; Is this an old mechanic's tale or is there something to this?

that old mechanic never had time to work on cars dreaming up all these
tales!!!!
