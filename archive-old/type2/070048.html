&gt;one thing i am looking for (besides an electric fridge for really 
&gt;cheap), is a small water pump for my sink.  of course the original one 
&gt;is kaput.  i cannot seem to find a suitable electric replacement.  the 
&gt;only ones i have found are huge and expensive.  any suggestions?
&gt;
&gt;thanks for the ear(s)

Try the J.C. Whitney catalog. They have a small electric pump in the RV
section that works just great. We put one in last summer. Fits right
where the old one did under the sink. Was under $20.
