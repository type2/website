Subject: Re: [T2] tire pressure in '71

&gt; The Bentley is another good source but there
&gt; has been some confusion on the list in the past
&gt; concerning the correct pressure for campers
&gt; because around 1971 the tires changed from bias
&gt; ply to radial and the Bentley recommendations
&gt; diverged: a reinforced tire for campers and a
&gt; commerical tire for the other body types.

Which doesn't make a bit of sense.  The
reinforced tires have lesser max pressures and
lesser max load than the commercial tires. 
Obviously, the camper is heavier than the station
wagon and should require the heavier tire.  I
think somebody reversed the recommendations.
