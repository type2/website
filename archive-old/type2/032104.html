Subject: Re:[T2] Front Axle/Engine Seal Bonanza

&gt; ...does anyone know of a source for the torque converter bushing...

I've had VW torque converters rebuilt on two occasions. One time I got a
TC bushing from an automatic transmission rebuilding shop in Capitola, CA.
The other time I got it from a shop that specifically did just torque
converters in east San Diego, CA.

Try such a place. This is specialized hardware.

Good luck,
