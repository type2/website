Subject: Re: [T2] Alcohol and Driving

If I remember correctly (I will accept correction on this). Some vehicle
manufacturers notified vehicle owners that their fuel lines and some
gaskets and filters had to be upgraded when the most recent fuel blends
were introduced into major cities about three years ago.
VW would have also sent out this notice on the ethanol/gas blend would
have effected their vehicles.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Would it be possible to convert an air-cooled VW engine to run on 
&gt; 100%
&gt; &gt; ethanol? If it is possible, what would be involved? Would it work 
&gt; on carbs
&gt; &gt; or fuel injection, or both maybe? Change valve sizes, material,
&gt; &gt; lift/duartion, CR?  Hotter spark plugs? Anything else come to 
&gt; mind? Let's
&gt; &gt; assume that the supply of ethanol isn't a problem and that we're 
&gt; talking
&gt; &gt; about a small fleet, not a single vehicle.
&gt; 
&gt; The following racing series run alcohol: the Indy Racing League 
&gt; (fuel
&gt; injection, no turbos), CART (FI, turbo in 2001 changing to non-turbo 
&gt; in the
&gt; next few years), World of Outlaws (carbs), Alcohol Funny Cars and 
&gt; Dragsters
&gt; (not sure what they use for induction) and Monster Trucks (carbs 
&gt; with
&gt; superchargers, IIRC). Monster trucks run alcohol because most 
&gt; monster truck
&gt; races are held indoors, and alcohol exhaust is less likely to kill 
&gt; the
&gt; spectators than gasoline exhaust. I'd say you could run either carb 
&gt; or FI.
&gt; 
&gt; One thing I know you have to worry about is the construction of 
&gt; your
&gt; induction system. Alcohol will dissolve parts of some carbs; get a 
&gt; copy of
&gt; Stock Car Racing magazine and you'll find carbs specially set up for 
&gt; alcohol
&gt; racing series. These won't dissolve. (These are also Holley 650cfm
&gt; Dominators. I don't think you want this on your Bus.) I seem to 
&gt; remember a
&gt; Cadillac (or maybe it was a Chrysler; I know it was a 70's vintage
&gt; &quot;establishment car&quot;) that came with instructions to not run gasohol 
&gt; because
&gt; the alcohol in it would dissolve the injectors. Gasohol is 90% 
&gt; gasoline and
&gt; 10% alcohol; I can just imagine how quickly straight alcohol would 
&gt; eat the
&gt; nozzles.
&gt; 
&gt; Alcohol's also hygroscopic--means it draws water from the air. And 
&gt; worst of
&gt; all, it has an invisible flame. All you see looks like heat waves 
&gt; shimmering
&gt; up away from the burning thing. I saw a show about Indy Racing League 
&gt; safety
&gt; teams. They use local firefighters, who are told, &quot;we are going to 
&gt; issue you
&gt; a special foam for alcohol fires. If you see a driver rolling around 
&gt; on the
&gt; ground for no apparent reason, you just soak down everything you see 
&gt; with
&gt; this foam.&quot; I would definitely label the Buses &quot;runs on alcohol&quot; 
&gt; just in
&gt; case the fire department has to deal with one of them.
