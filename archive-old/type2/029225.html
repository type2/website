Dear List,

I'm hoping that someone will have a good fix to my NLA part for my '71 4
speed tranny.  It is the &quot;dust cover inner shift lever&quot; or the boot that
covers the end of the nosecone.  The part number is 211 301 289A and no one
has it that I know of.  Tried Weddle, Ron, Old Volks, Wolfsburg West and
none had it.  A guy at Wolfsburg suggested going to a 4x4 store that
carries shock boots and finding one of them that would fit.  Don't have any
around and hate hot pink ;)  Anyone tried anything else that would work?
Got to keep the dirt and dust out of my tranny and off of my shiny new
hockey stick :)

I have to offer a 72 Owner's Manual anyone who wants it.  It was Rudolph
Barrette's from Jacksonville, FL but he left it in the glovebox when his
bus went to the junkyard.  It is in fair shape but does provide lots of
info including his maintenance record. (first rebuild was at 52k miles)
Not a lot of it pertinent to my 71 though...  Anyone that wants it can have
it just let me know.

Thanks for the help and am looking forward to smooth shifting.

- Brian
71 Bus
