&gt; Before you totaly dismiss the stock VW bus tranaxle, I would go to this

&gt; lot of other Buses powered by V8's and V6's that use the stock VW trans,
&gt; both the 002's and the 091's. This is an Aussie site and I think it
belongs

Hi,

Well I can answer some questions, first up most of the V8 and V6 buses run
the 091's obviously for the taller ratios and extra strength.  On my Baja
site they run the standard ratios because they are mostly built for off road
use, you don't need anything taller.  My Bus also runs a V8 with 235/75/15
tires on the rear and a 091 transaxle.  I didn't want super low mud crawling
ability over freeway running and engine life so I looked into transaxle
options.  Basically it was cheaper for me to get an 091 built up to my specs
than to put in a 5 speed.

Every single gear in there is custom made except reverse to cope with the
torque and the low reving V8 motor there is generally now 1 tooth where
before there was 2 or 3 meaning each tooth is thicker and stronger, the
teeth are also cut a little straighter.  It'll pull 110kmh at approx
2100rpm.  Almost any ratio can be cut for the Bus, I picked mine based on
the car the engine came from and then dropped them a little because of the
extra weight I'm pulling, took a bit of calculating due to tire sizes as
well but it all worked OK.  Now ideally I'd love a 5 speed but the cost of
Porsche boxes down here is way over the top and adapting a Subaru box was
out of my league.

The guys that run the standard boxes know that one day they'll break, and
believe me it's always spectacular, I broke one 002 doing wheelstands, ever
seens a bus pick up the front wheels at a set of traffic lights :), I had an
091 ready to go in before hand though.  Before I got this box I went through
3 transaxles, although I was never easy on them.  Now I go through clutches
instead.

Anyway, the ideal choice is the transaxle that goes with the engine, as long
as the weight of the Bus isn't to far off the original car/whatever, after
that a modified 091 will cope with the power and is cheaper to do than fit
another makers transaxle, this is followed by an 091 which will last if you
just drive, but with a hot motor who isn't going to have a laugh every now
and then.  The last option is the 002, big wheelstands tire shredding
burnouts (those ratios are low) but with a lifespan of about a week you
better have a few in the shed and know how to rip them out and put them in
at night before the next trip to work.

As for adapting the reduction boxes, I dare you to do it ;) and then send me
the pics for the Baja bus site or the Wild VW site :) Ohh, and when you do
find out if you can flip the ring and pinion let me know.

Cheers and thanks
Steve

P.S Just for your info here are the ratios I run :-
1st 2.83, 2nd 1.81, 3rd 1.14, 4th 0.7 with standard 091 ring and pinion
