&gt;...and finally how important is
&gt; it that the ground strap from the transmission  be grounded properly and
&gt; would it relate to this problem
&gt; Thanks!

That ground strap is very important, its the true ground from your engine to 
the chassis.
Your problem may be the ignition switch and/or wires from ignition switch to 
starter/solenoid.
