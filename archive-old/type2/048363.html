&gt;I'll bet your hot idle oil pressure after a half hour of 55 mph driving is
not very high (5 to 10) psi.

This is an interesting point. If you want to see something really scary,
take a ride in a new O*ds Aur*ra. These are equipped with a 'control center'
that is capable of displaying current oil pressure. After warm-up, they
consistently display an oil pressure of 7 PSI at idle. Normally.

Reciprocating Air Compressors use splash lubrication (0PSI) with electric
drive motors putting in the equivalent of 50HP and give an amazing service
life on the rod bearings, which are basically identical to automotive
bearings. With similar bearing loads.

The oil light has never lit or flashed on my AVP at hot idle, and I know it
is working. We live in the highest peaks of the Appalachians, and some of
the grades are considerable. We have even run the van at almost full
throttle (75MPH-probably had a tailwind) coming home from Missouri for
several (two) hours at a time. Not a problem.

I am going to stop bragging about my engine now, before it explodes.
