&gt;OK, I have stupid on my forehead. But now the question.
&gt;
&gt;Where did I get the idea from,


I have read about dumping diesel in the a gas carb to clean it out. 
It think that is mentioned in the Muir book. There is also a theory 
about running some ATF through a diesel motor but that may be urban 
legend.

Who knows :)
