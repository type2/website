I believe they said it was a volks engine that was made for an airplane,
not for a car, so that would probably explain the larger pricetag on it.
As for the carbs, I didn't pay that close attention to it ;)
Have a good Friday.

Jonathan

	Hey, all!  Since it's Friday Fun-day and all...

	I watched that show too, and thought it great fun, especially
when the Monster Garage staff just SHREDDED the NB to get all the AC
stuff into the back of it.  Did anyone else happen to catch how much
they were charged for the alleged &quot;1600&quot;?  I could have sworn the
narrator said it took an approximately $2800 bite out of the $3000
budget!!!  I also couldn't quite decide if it was sporting a Weber carb
on one bank and a Dellorto carb on the other, when it first came out of
the box.  Later on they seemed to have gotten a matched set of carbs
(either Webers or Dells), but I was thinking at first &quot;Boy, did that
off-road shop that supplied the motor have a laff!&quot; AND they charged
them $2800 for the privilege for throwing together some extra junk they
had laying around the shop...  They also mentioned the name of the shop
and/or showed the name on the shipping container, but it was said really
quickly the one time and/or in a real quick camera take.
