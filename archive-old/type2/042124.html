&gt; hello all,
&gt; 
&gt; my friend has a 71, just installed a new rebuilt 1600 DP. everything was
&gt; hooked up and it ran okeh.  He then decided, (before driving it) that he
&gt; should have the transmission rebuilt.  he pulled the engine (again),  had
&gt; the transmission rebuilt and then reinstalled the whole thing again. It has
&gt; a NEW Bosch coil, distributor, and alternator. He also just installed a NEW
&gt; 650 amp battery.  when he hooked up the ignition coil wire, he said he
&gt; accidentally hooked it up with the ignition wire to the minus side, and the
&gt; wire from the condenser to the plus side.  When he connected the battery got
&gt; major sparkage and the distributor had smoke coming out of it.  When he
&gt; realized his mistake he disconnected the battery.
&gt; 
&gt; now, he has been trying to trouble shoot it.  he took out all the fuses,
&gt; disconnected the coil, and when he tries to connect the battery he gets
&gt; MAJOR sparkage.

My guess is that while he had things hooked up backwards he melted the
insulation on the points rendering them always grounded.  You get one
guess as to how I know this can happen.

Solution is to replace the points.  You will find that the wire leading
to the points inside the distributor is a crispy critter, having produced
that impressive smoke that was shooting out of the vent holes on the
bottom of the distributor.
