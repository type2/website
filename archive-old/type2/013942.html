&gt; &gt;I was discouraged from doing this by my local VWFLAPS.  Apparently there
&gt; &gt;may be a quality difference between the autozone &quot;rebuilt&quot;
&gt; &gt;CVs and the Lobro &quot;new&quot; CVs.  I don't know if this is true, but for me the
&gt; &gt;autozone part had to be ordered and the VWFLAPS had the CV
&gt; &gt;on the shelf, which sealed the decision.
&gt;
&gt; I merely suggested replacing the entire axle assembly with one from Auto
&gt; Zone as they are cheap and available. That way he isn't on the side of the
&gt; road for days waiting for a UPS truck or NAPA to get an order in for him.
&gt; Anything that gets him moving would be good enough. Surely the cheapest
&gt; axle would get him home.

I understand your philosophy here, and I would certainly go the same way
if I was caught on the road with a shot CV.

&gt; As for the VW FLAPS - some are good and some are not. I was running my old
&gt; axles with NO BOOTS for a couple of years. I knew they were worn and I
&gt; wanted to see how long they would last. They never failed. I decided I
&gt; didn't have the money for new axles but at least wanted to make them
&gt; watertight for winter. I paid a visit to a VW FLAPS in Chattanooga (90
&gt; miles away and near our families). The replacement boots were good looking
&gt; but failed in under a month - - no warranty that he would stand behind.

I feel your pain!  My local VWFLAPS seems to be pretty good.  The
counterman knew the jumper bodge to make a common VW 5-terminal headlight
relay work like the unobtanium 4-terminal relay.  When I asked him about
the brand and origin of the last CV boots I bought (on the phone) he said,
&quot;Don't worry, they're German.  I don't stock the Taiwan junk&quot;  Since it
seems that he knows my concerns even before I ask, I'd say that the shop
is competent.  He said that the rebuilt axles get new balls and cages, as
these are the parts most likely to be bad.  However, the balls are not
matched to the individual CVs as they supposedly are on new Lobro CVs.

&gt; All I am saying here is just because the parts come from a VW FLAPS, there
&gt; is no automatic guarantee that you are getting good quality parts.

So true.  I can think of one shop in the San Fernando Valley that I
wouldn't set foot in.  Lotsa shiny chrome Taiwan tin that doesn't come
close to fitting.  Fool me once...

&gt; That
&gt; said - I AM SURE - that your VW FLAPS has to be better than this one. I
&gt; won't ever do business with that fellow again...
&gt;
&gt; I bought two of Auto Zone's axles expecting little from them, I'll report
&gt; on them later once I have some mileage on them. They fit my budget at that
&gt; moment and come with alifetime warranty. I know what little that really
&gt; means but sometimes the manager will actually stand behind what the
&gt; customer THINKS that means. I used to work for Advance Auto so I certainly
&gt; recognize that the quality of the basic supermarket FLAPS parts is rather
&gt; poor on many things. But that is another thread...

Your report will be interesting.  I have little use for &quot;lifetime
warranties&quot; as the real cost in CV replacement is the labor.  When I hear
of folks who are happy because they are on their fourth starter on a
&quot;lifetime warranty&quot; deal I wonder if they are counting the time and hassle
of removing and replacing the starter, being stranded, etc. in their cost
savings over a new Bosch part.

&gt; I don't even shop at Auto Zone or Advance unless the item I need comes in a
&gt; bottle. At the time the NAPA replacements were quite pricey and my budget
&gt; was shot. NAPA is really the only other better quality parts store locally.
&gt; (Small Town)

NAPA is a savior in small town America.  The prices are a bit steep, but
when you need a particular part in the boonies.
