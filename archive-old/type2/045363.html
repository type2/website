Subject: Re: [T2] dipstick, poptop questions

Christopher Darilek sends:

&gt; 1. How far apart are the one quart low and full
&gt; markings on a pancake engine's dipstick?  Less
&gt; than half an inch?  There's another mark scratched
&gt; in mine another half inch up and I'm trying to figure
&gt; it out.

Mine came with little crosshatchings between the full and add marks, like
the ones on a Ford's automatic transmission dipstick. They're about an inch
apart.
