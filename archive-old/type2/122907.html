Subject: Re: [T2] isolators and regulator info - Thanks Guys!

But isn't that what your saying yourself?

'and a switch to toggle it manually'

Where is this switch? on the relay?

J

&gt;But where would you find a switch that could handle 300+ amps?
&gt;Much easier to use the high-power relay with large cables and a switch to 
&gt;toggle it manually.
