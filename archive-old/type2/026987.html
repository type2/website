Subject: Refurbishing sliding-door-gear steel rail

From: Nigel A. Skeet, Great Britain
To: VW Type 2 Listees
Date: 7th September 2001
Reply to: naskeet_at_hotmail_dot_com

Dear Listees.

I am currently refurbishing the sliding door gear of my 1973 VW Type 2; 
particularly the steel support cum guide rail, below the side window.

Are there any hard wearing, low friction, corrosion resistant coatings, 
which can be applied to the rail, to inhibit wear and rusting of the rail?

This would have to be applied in-situ, so the coating must either air-cure, 
or be like some two-pack epoxy, I would imagine. Use of modest heat from a 
hair dryer or similar device, would be okay.

From past experience, I have found that paint wears quickly or chips off.

Sensible suggestions please?!

Regards.
          Nigel A. Skeet
