Subject: 1600 SP Carb woes

Hi List,
I am in the process of resurecting my '68 Westy 1600 sp.
The motor is the stock set-up, single carb, etc.
When I was last out looking at it, a friend noticed that the choke was
really stiff, and not &quot;springy&quot;. You could shove your finger in the top of
the carb and move the butterfly but it would stay where you moved it.

So now, problem,  I need to get this puppy mobile in 48 hours. The bus runs,
this I know, but it isn't a fan of idling, could this be attributed to the
choke? It will stay lit as long as you keep the rpm's higher than an idle,
but if you let off, it dies.

So in summary:
1) how does one quickly fix a sticky choke?
2) does a stick choke affect your idle?
3) what is correct protocol for adjusting your idle speed? (I don't have a
tach installed)
