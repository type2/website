&gt;&gt;Ok In my bus (and in the picture on the link I attached) there is a slot 
&gt;&gt;at the bottom of the fridge for something to slide in to. On the super 
&gt;&gt;original 72 in my link there IS a big tray there as if a vegetable crisper 
&gt;&gt;or something. http://www.72camper_dot_com/3936.jpg If this tray is not 
&gt;&gt;original what are the slots for? A rack? It sure looks original. &lt;&lt;

My ice box came from a 73 and it has several slots too, but it only has the 
wire basket and the ice tray with the drain hose.  I figured the mulitple 
slots allow you some adjustments.
