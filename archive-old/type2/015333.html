hi doktortim...

High Steve,

&gt;Are you opposed to carrying spares like extra brake fluid? extra oil?
&gt;extra spark plugs... extra fan belts, accelerator cable and clutch cable 
&gt;wiring stuff etc.?

I am not at all opposed to you carrying spares. What I was trying to say,
and most evidently poorly, is that I don't need to because I trust the
thoughough nature of my inspections when I don't have incentives to compromise
my machines. The risk of my breaking down is extremely small. I can't remember
replacing a flat tire on one of my machines since I left for college. That was
1969. It has to do with attitude, aptitude, tenacity and hard won experience.
All these things differ amonst all us apes. You don't have to rely on luck if
you understand some very simple universal principles. 

&gt;i was a boy scout at one time and i like their motto... be prepared.

I agree. I prepare my vehicle for abscence of failure with the inevitable
gap left between my abilities and perfection. You may prepare via method 
of your choice. I accept the risk for my gap, in all things, as do us all,
in case you weren't aware. 

&gt;(plus my stash of spares sometimes gives me the opportunity to help
&gt;others... 
&gt; helped out a good friend 
&gt;almost free t-shirt)

Oh, I see you are aware. 
That is a hell of a good point. Good way to narrow the gap a little more.
I think I'll use it. On my next trip, I'll load a bunch of VW essentials
for uninspected vehicles sitting at the side of the road because they had
not yet learned of the DM.  And while installing that throttle cable for
them I could initiate them into the minds responsible for das machinen.

If I was Harry Pellow, I would give them a gold plated carb nut as a momento
to memorialize the experiance. 

&gt;peas,
&gt;
