Subject: T2 list is an amazing resource!

I've not been on the list as long as some (most?), but I continue to
be amazed at the depth of information, links, insights and knowledge
gained from personal experience, occasionally to the most minute and
seemingly inconsequential details that many of the posters posess and
are willing to impart to the list. Thanks to Karl, Richard and all
those who make this list the encyclopedia of VW information that it
is.
I always knew that there was a cult of VW, but the subculture of Type
2 enthusiasts is mind boggling. I sometimes mutter to myself, &quot;It's a
Bus thing, you wouldn't understand&quot;

Rick
