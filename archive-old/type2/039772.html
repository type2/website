&gt; Personally, I find that driving makes my
&gt; throat very dry,

ME TOO!!! I tend to fill my Westy's water tank with
equal parts of: Tequila, Rum, Vodka, Gin and
Triple-Sec....then, I simply by a Pepsi from 7-11 and
top it off from my faucet....VOILA!!! Long-Island
Iced-Tea!!! 

Now, with a concoction *this* valuable, I *never*
trust a cup holder...I use a spill-proof squeeze
bottle, but that's just me. Use your own
'drinking-and-driving' judgement here.


Seriously...I take this ridiculous thread to mean that
we are all (collectively) having a relatively
trouble-free week with our busses, as there hasn't
been much 'real' content;-)

I'll drink to that!!!;-)


Here's a thought... How 'bout we just lighten-up on
what the 'yuppies' and 'neandereers' (what the Hell
*is* a 'neandereer', anyway????;-) are doing, and just
learn to enjoy life??? Ok, bad idea.


One last note for those who take life (and this post)
*WAY* too seriously, this is what is commonly referred
to by normal folk as a *joke*. I do not condone
drinking and driving...nor for that matter, taking
life too seriously. Both are detrimental to your
health, and should probably have a Surgeon-General's
warning attached to them. And yes, I, like most of
you, have probably done both more than once...but
that's no excuse.


Later...I'm off to a VW show 3 blocks from my house!
Don't need no cup holders, cell-phones, A/C,
Cruise-Control, or pessimistic PITA's... Just me, the
kid and the dog:-) Hope to see you there!
