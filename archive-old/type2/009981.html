Well, here i am in Sunriver, Oregon, van up on stands, transmission ready to 
be dropped. Yesterday when enroute here from the other side of the mountains 
my clutch discontinued its much appreciated service and left me limping in 
3rd gear.  Luckily i made to rental house, pretty much unscathed, save a bit 
of excessive abuse to my tranny and engine.  But i made it.

Now for the emergency clutch installation...

I got the sachs kit this morning from a VW dealer in bend, carrerra's VWs, 
great service and not so bad prices (only 50 bucks more than busdepot), when 
you're in a bind that's not so bad.

Any list members around these parts?  I should be able to handle it, but 
sure would appreciate that safety net.

Hopefully she'll be rolling tomorrow...
