Subject: I need a set of 2L engine tin, High Country

Hello List,

I need a set of 2L bus engine tin. I have a 914 motor
which has about half of its engine tin but I need a
complete set of 2L Bus engine tin so I can fit this
engine in my 74 bus. I will be at High Country Bus
Festville this year and can pick it up there. If you
have a set to sell and won't be going to High Country,
then that would be great too. Just let me know what
the shipping will be. Thanks so much! 

My address is 

David Kelly
213 ILEX Drive
Wilmington, NC 28412

If you have a set to sell, let me know. Thanks!!!!

David Kelly
