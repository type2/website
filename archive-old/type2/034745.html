It's not all that hard.  Go down to Radio Shack and buy the cheapest CB
mobile that they have.  CB radios are power-limited by law, so it
doesn't pay to spend more than about $50 or so on a CB.

The key to a decent installation is a good antenna.  I recommend the 6
foot &quot;firestik&quot; antenna for bus use.  If you have a tubular roof rack,
you can mount to that or else you can get a gutter-clamp type mount. 
It is quite important that you mount the antenna to the roof, as
mounting the antenna to the side of the bus will reduce your radiated
power by quite a bit.

For a &quot;no visible holes&quot; mounting, put the gutter clamp near the engine
air intake, run the coax cable down the air intake, and bring it up
behind the spare tire.  You'll have to drill a hole there to bring the
wire into the car, but the hole will be hidden by the spare tire cover.
route the coax to the front of the bus to hook to the radio.

Power for the CB is no problem, as it draws less than a typical stereo.
 You can draw power from the accessory fuse on the fuse block.

The toughest thing is to get the antenna cut to the correct length to
resonate.  For this you need a SWR bridge or (really nice) an SWR
analyzer.  Without adjustment, your antenna will probably not be
matched to the radio, and your power output will suffer.  Your best bet
is to get in touch with an avid ham or CBer and let them show you how
its done.

OK, assuming that you do all of the above, what kind of performance can
you expect?  In open terrain (line of sight) you might get a mile or
two of range.  In the mountains it will drop to a half-mile or so. 
Don't expect too much of a CB!

An alternative, if all you want is car-to-car communications, is to
pick up a couple of those FRS handheld radios.  No hookups, no holes,
and performance is as good or better than the CBs.  Not so many
foul-mouthed idiots, either!

Of course you can go off the deep end and become a Ham operator.  Then
you can have six antennas on your bus like me!
