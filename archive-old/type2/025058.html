The best way I have found to pinpoint an exhaust leak (or a vacuum leak), is 
to buy a $10 stethoscope, pull the dollar size metal pc. off the end and get 
a 18&quot; pc. of copper tubing that fits inside the plastic tube of the 
stethoscope. Listen around all exhaust joints, connections, etc.  You will 
notice a leak if its there.  Next, do not let a leak go for very long, 
especially if it is close to the head.  you could easily overheat the exhaust 
valve and possibly drop a valveseat. You will not have to remove the engine 
for any exhaust work. One more thing...if you do exhaust work make sure to 
use the VW copper nuts, with no washers; they will never &quot;freeze&quot; on the 
steal studs...
