&gt; My last question regarding the damm transmission (had a frustrating
&gt; evening getting selector shaft out). Anyone know of a good
&gt; article/procedure on changing the transmission oil while the
&gt; transmission is still in the van?

It's too simple for an article.

Step 1 - remove fill plug

Step 2 - remove drain plug

Step 3 - replace drain plug

Step 4 - fill transmission with GL-4 fluid

Step 5 - replace fill plug.

DO NOT drain the trans until you have removed the fill plug!  The plugs
can be difficult to remove and it would be better to leave well enough
alone rather than removing the fluid and having no way to replace it.

&gt; It would seem that I need some type of
&gt; pump to fill the transmission up. What does the community use?

Either a pump or a helper.  If you have a helper and a meter of hose you
can run the hose past the breast tin, crawl underneath and tell your
helper to squeeze or stop as necessary.  When your trans runneth over,
stop, let the excess run out for about 15 minutes then close it up.

If you go to your FLAPS you should find a pump that screws to the top of
the bottle that will allow you to transfer fluid to the transmission.
A picture of the pump you are looking for is at the bottom of this page:

&gt; And what type of seal is on the drain/fill plugs? Nothing is listed on
&gt; my ETKA.

There is no seal.  The plugs are tapered and need a 17mm allen wrench to
remove.  These wrenches are very available at FLAPs or Sears but if you
don't have one or cannot find one then a 17mm-headed bolt with a couple of
nuts double-nutted to the shaft will do in an emergency.

                             OOK!
