Subject: Re: [T2] Hello All!

May have trouble getting powder into the seam between outer and inner 
rim (front of rim).

Also as it like thick paint check the lug nut torques after a few miles. 
Somebody one time speculated about the paint compressing causing the lug 
nut to loosen and the wheel to come off. End result is a coating about 
the same (in my experience) as brushed on paint.

One Type2-lister suggested caulking to fill that troublesome seam later.
