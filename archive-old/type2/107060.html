Subject: Re: [T2] dizzy hole isn't deep enough

Drew,

Some of this is basic, but I'm not sure what your experience level is...

Assuming you have the right distributor, it may take some force and rotation
to get the dizzy in.  Try lubing it with engine oil (do you have the rubber
o-ring installed?)

Once the distributor bottoms out, you will probably need to rotate the dizzy
shaft to line it up with the notch in the drive plate/gear.  It only lines
up one way. This will allow it to drop in a little further.

If all that doesn't work:  If by chance you rotated the engine with the
dizzy removed, the dizzy drive gear may have popped out.  If that is the
case, your timing will be on another planet.  This can be fixed with some
nuisance value, but I'm not up on the procedure. I'm sure it's in the
library and/or archives.
