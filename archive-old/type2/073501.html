&gt;1.  My bus has a single carb, but I thought they had duals, am I mistaken,
&gt;or has some type of conversion been done?  Should I have concwens about
&gt;this?

Yes, it should have come with dual Solexes.  Switching to a single Weber
was a common conversion.  It would be difficult to find all of the original
parts that you would need to convert back.  It will run okay with the Weber
if you take the time to set it up properly (check the archives) with the
possible exception of poor cold-weather running.

&gt;2.  Underneath the bus in the center there is what appears to be a large
&gt;radiator/heat exchanger type of device with hoses coming out of each end.
&gt;Two of the hoses are in the engine compartment, where the auxiliary bettery
&gt;would be, but are not connected. Not sure yet where the other two end up.

That would be the Air Conditioning Condenser.  Sounds like you might have a
Safare or Adventurewagen conversion!  The two hoses in the engine
compartment would have gone to the compressor.  Look for signs of a missing
evaporator/blower unit up front either overhead or under the dash.  Check
your headliner for a fading pattern.  If your camper is a Safare, it will
have an identification plate and serial number at the rear base of the
passenger door, on the B pillar.

&gt;3. There is no aux battery, will the fridge work anyway, or does it neeed
&gt;the other battery.  I plugged it in to A/C and it did nothing, I will need
&gt;to investigate further.

It should have worked when plugged into A/C.  Some fridges have a switch
down at the bottom that you have to use to go between A/C and D/C - check
for that.  If it's a Safare, the fridge will not run from D/C without the
aux battery.  Check for a relatively fat (10 gauge) wire back to the left
of the engine near the A/C hoses you mentioned earlier.

&gt;Any other tips for a new owner?

Absolutely.  Check the type2 list archives at vw.i405_dot_com for hours and
hours of interesting reading plus a few off-topic posts and unsubscribe
requests.
