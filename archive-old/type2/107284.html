Subject: Re: [T2] how to tell if a valve is bent when the valve spring
  keeper is  busted

Sound like a bent valve to me. Don't know about the need new head 
statement though. Most heads can be rebuilt. If your strapped for cash 
and adventurous you could replace the valve yourself  but i would highly 
recommend replacing the valve guide also. I've seen the results of a 
chunk of valve guide doing a dance inside cylinder #3. You definitely do 
not want to go there!

If I were in your mechanics gloves I'd blow 20 bucks at the flaps and 
get a cheapo 2 ton floor jack and check out BusDepot_dot_com for the current 
price on a rebuilt head. Last I checked about 185.00 + core. I've lots 
of experience working on bugs and American hot rods when I was a kid. 
did my first bus engine about 1 1/2 year ago with little help pulling 
the motor and no help going back in. This aint' bragging only saying 
it's not hard if you plan ahead.

Another train of thought is; 950.00 is getting close to the price of a 
rebuilt engine if you install it yourself.
