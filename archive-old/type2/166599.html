Subject: VW Tent question

This cavaet was with a recent posting on the un-named auction site.  Is it
true (taller on the side that attaches to the VW), or just more work for the
MythBuster

&quot;&quot;&quot;Note: Look closely at the photo and you'll notice that the tent is
designed to be taller on the side that attaches to the VW. So please pay
close attention when erecting the poles. The red tape goes to the VW side.
If not set up correctly you will end up with a lop-sided tent. &quot;&quot;&quot;

Lord, if you have a MythBuster, you must have had a MytherBuster &gt;&gt;&gt;
