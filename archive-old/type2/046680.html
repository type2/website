Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Levels

[...]Both of my ACVWs exhibit the behavior described, and I usually (but not
always) find that the procedure given by George Lyle gives repeatable
results.  I think there may be something going on with surface tension  of the
oil.  If, after checking, I find the level to be low, when I expect it to be
higher, if possible I go away for a half hour and come back and check it
again.  If it's still low, I add a little.

Not sure I agree with not keeping the level at the full mark at all times.
While it could be (and often is) true that blowby is increased on a higher
mileage engine, that same engine probably needs all the cooling it can get,
and the proper oil level is bound to help.

&gt; &gt; That's weird, I never really had that problem with the 1600 engine in my
&gt; &gt; Type 2. But I DO have problems reading the ATF-level in my 1971
&gt; &gt; Fastback, but that's a different mailinglist I guess. By the way: nobody
&gt; &gt; could help me there as well, so my advice is: just try to keep the oil
&gt; &gt; level as close to maximum as possible (as far as you can read it
&gt; &gt; anyway), a little bit too much oil won't hurt I think.
&gt;
&gt; I have noted different readings depending upon how the dipstick is
&gt; handled.  I've found that putting the stick in rapidly and removing it
&gt; rapidly will result in a low reading.  I usually push it in, pull it up
&gt; slightly, seat it firmly, wait a couple of seconds, then pull it for a
&gt; reading, with much more consistent results.
&gt;
&gt; Of course, it's important to let the engine sit for at least a few minutes
&gt; before checking, so the oil can drain back to the sump.  Otherwise the
&gt; reading will be low.
&gt;
&gt; Note that it isn't such a good idea to keep the oil to the full mark at
&gt; all times.  I've found that oil blowby will increase above the midway
&gt; point.
&gt;
&gt; After rereading the above paragraphs, I don't know whether to post it to
&gt; the Type2 list or submit it to Playboy...  :)
