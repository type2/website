I have finally settled on a paint scheme for my '68 Westy and it might sound
hideous to some of you.  I really love the Splitty scheme of charcoal over
that deep tomato soup/brick red.  I don't want to guess by looking at a fan
deck in a paint store or something like that.  I'm looking at the paint code
page:
http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~deasterw/paint.html 
and it appears that I want L53 Sealing Wax Red but none of the Grey's chips
are loading and the L73 Chestnut Brown &amp; L312 Palm Green look exactly alike
on my screen.  Can someone tell me which Grey it was that came in this
scheme?  Thanks,
