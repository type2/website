probably much more trouble than it is worth, that is major project

&gt; Also it sounds like the engine is
&gt; screaming! when I only am going 55mph. The gas milage is crap and I am
&gt; not sure what to do at this point. I have changed the modulator and the
&gt; vacume lines. 

if your engine &quot;really&quot; is sceaming it may be overrevving, most likely it
would be because the tranny is not upshifting to 3rd.
  you should be able to hear/feel two shifts, one about 10-15mph  the
second about 30-35.  check the vacuum lines again, also in Bentley there
are instructions on how to adjust the modulator.

good luck
Bob
