Hello volks-

The rear hatch on the '76 has started to rattle really badly over the last
few months. Yesterday, I tried adjusting it (loosened the strike plate and
moved it forward (FIF) as far as I could). It rattles a little less, but
still annoying. At that time, I noticed that the rubber striker looked
pretty worn. Can these purchased new? (RMMW doesn't have the correct one
listed.) Anyone have a good one they would want to sell/trade?

Thank you muchly,

Jeff
