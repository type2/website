	Bought a '71 Parts Bus sight unseen last month for $150.00.  It was
located in Houlton, Maine (not to far from the Candian border.)  Made a
deal with a guy to haul down here in New Hampshire for a rusted out Alfa
Romeo Alfetta sedan.

	Well it arrived today after a 7 hour trip and I knew it was a good omen
when I saw the shiny VW emblem on the front as it pulled up.  As I looked
closer it was a deluxe bus with all of the chrome and what was that thing
under the dash that wasn't on my other '71?  It had factory installed air !
 All the seats and interior trim was there even the spare tire cover.  It
had the original dual port engine with vacuum advance carb ( My other has a
009)  Taking up about a 1/4 of the left side of the engine was the
airconditioning pump.

	In the glove box was the original title and bill of sale from Biloxi, Miss.

	On the underside take up most of the middle was a large maybe 3ft X 3ft
louvered unit.  Does this tie in to the ac?  

	Some rust in the rockers and front wheel wells.  But worth $150.00 for
sure.  How rare is the factory air option?
