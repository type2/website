Ok.. I think this is a clue because that's strange that it won't start 
using the fluid.  At this point, I'd pull off injectors and use a test 
light to see if it's still firing the injectors.  I would also keep 
trying to start it a few more times as maybe it flooded itself?  I think 
the key here is trying to figure out why it stopped.  Also do a check to 
see that spark is going to to each spark plug.  Timing here is critical 
because it only seems like it happens after it's run for a little.  We 
need to figure out if it's the timing that stops, the efi that stops, or 
if it's just getting flooded?  However, the fact that it won't start 
with fluid would lead me to believe that it's either flooded or the 
ignition stopped working.

&gt; ??? intermittent electrical problem????  I wasn't even touching the engine
&gt; when it stopped, just listening to it run and trying to determine what was
&gt; what.   it never did more than idle, could not get it to rev up at all??/

check the flapper vane in the AFM and make sure it's not stuck.

&gt; got it on the charger while I mumble to myself and to the german auto
&gt; dieties

always good ;)

&gt; am on a different checked out AFM
&gt; using a diffirent brain box.
&gt; using stock points/condenser/rotor etc

I'd try and figure out why it stopped running.  That's the interesting 
part.  *especially* because it won't run on fluid... that sounds like 
ignition, or flooding to me.  Granted, I'm guessing that flooding might 
stop a cylinder from firing, even if you use fluid...

&gt; over the hump on the rt 301 bridge over the potomac river. called it
&gt; quits in LaPlata MD, wrote this off as the sunken valve seat but now I
&gt; wonder...???

Yeah, something's up.. I think as long as you have descent compression, 
valves are adjusted, and the cam/distributor are in the proper 
orientation, then any other problems should be with ignition/fuel.

try the above, though, and let me know what you find.

also, while we're at it - pull off and plug the vacuum line to the brake 
booster.  Might as well eliminate that as a potential vacuum leak...
