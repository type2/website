&gt;Im really sorryi f this is not the right addy to write to but im after
&gt;some help and u are my last hope...

Heavens. You *are* in a bad way then. =^ )

&gt;i have a type 2 aircooled vw camper
&gt;with a c.u 2litre engine. I was wondering if each crankcase was mached
&gt;specifically with each flywheel or is  it ok to change one second hand
&gt;flywheel for another? coz i have a badly scored flywheel wich i need to
&gt;change ..it would be great if u could help me..if not then thanks anyway

It is 100% fine to switch those horses in the middle of the stream. In the
interest of easing your mind I'm CCing this to the type2 list, where many
people will holler if I am wrong.
