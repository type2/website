&gt;do neither, find someone who does know how to rebuild ?1.8 liter engines

Yes, it's the 1.8

&gt;and get him to work together with you and rebuild the engine with the best
&gt;materials, take your time and learn as you go.

Wish I did know someone, and the money for this person wouldn't matter that
much if I knew such a person either.  But in my case it looks like I'm
eitheir stuck with a mechanic out of a shop, or buying a rebuilt engine.  I
don't have the resources or the the background to do it all by my lonesome.
I'd alsolike to get her running soon as my Golf's transmition is in bad
shape now.  I could always keep the original 1.8 and slowly rebuild it
myself too?

&gt;so what if you have to pay him something, you pay tuition at school

&gt;&gt; well at the very leat I need a valve job on my 74 bus Automatic w/fuil
&gt;&gt; injection.  Now I'm no wizz with rebuilding engines (I can only rebuild 2
&gt;&gt; stroke motors at this point).  Now do I pay about $1k for a rebuild on the
&gt;&gt; valves and maybe find out the engine also needs a rebuild for another 1k.
&gt;&gt; Or do I just go buy a rebuild and drop it in?
