Subject: Re: [T2] windshield sill woes

I drove down to a shop that one of the vw places uses. He said
they do nice work and the price isn't too high.

So I head down there, talk to the guy and he's
explaining what may be happening etc etc and this guy
comes up and starts peeking into my '74. I think he's simply
curious and all. I didn't hear him drive up but he pulled in
driving a '75 almost identicle to mine. Funny how timing works
out. He's friends with the body guy and picking something up
for his kid or something.

Anyway, long story short. I am taking it in on Tuesday
and he's going to take the windshield out, check out the
problem and fix it. He said worst case scenario is $400.
Probably closer to $300 for welding, por15, painting and
all the reseting of the windshield , seal etc.
I figure for that it's worth it. I can spare the canadian bucks
if it keeps rust out. The bus is pretty rust free and I want
it to last 'forever'. My 10 year old says that she wants the
bus when she's older... might have to start looking for one
for her :)

Sounds to me like the water is getting between the seal and the body.

Pull the windshield and I bet the sill is just fine. Put it back in
with some tar in there and you'll be good to go.
