It is a manual Transmission on a 72 bus with a 1800 engine, sorry I forgot to

mention that important piece of info, DUH. And yes I used the donut shaped
seals for the oil cooler, I just didn't torque them enough before I put the
engine back together. Then I could only get to two nuts on the cooler, and
finally the front one, I think I have warped the seals and figure I will just

replace them when I drop the engine this weekend.
