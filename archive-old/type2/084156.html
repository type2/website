&gt; Subject: engine Wires
&gt;
&gt; I am just about ready to install my motor in my 70 bus. I do not have my
&gt; Bentley's yet, it is on the way though. So until it gets here, I need to ask
&gt; the list my (what I hope to be) simple questions.
&gt;
&gt; How many wires should there be going to the motor?
&gt; I have found 4.
&gt; one is for the backup lights.
&gt; The other 3 I am unsure of.
&gt; One is GREEN    It is by itself on the passenger side.
&gt; The next two are in a sleeve together.
&gt; One of those is BLACK
&gt; The other is GREEN &amp; BLUE

When I rescued my '70 and got back on the road after 10 years I rented an engine (12 pack of Gordon Birsch Marzen a month) for awhile.  The engine came with a working alternator so rather than reinvent the wheel I stayed with it.  There are apparently 2 styles of alternators
with differing connections that are commonly used on VWs so after I determined which style I found that the VR is not used at all with my style.  The wires, in my case, are: single GREEN -- to spade connection on the alternator; and a new thick wire spliced from the battery POS
to the alternator post.  But, all that is moot if you have the other style alternator.

The 2 in the sleeve (as before) go across the engine -- BLACK to the coil, BLUE/GREEN to the oil sensor.
