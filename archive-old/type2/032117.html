Hi, folks:

I've had a loss of power and mileage in my 1970 bus over the last 3-4 gas
tanks. Took it in this morning to a local [Portland OR USA] place called
The Master Wrench. Didn't think this was going to be fun, and that guess
was right.  The Master Wrench's verdict: The engine is coming down to the
end of its days. He says the mechanic found signs that it had run hot
somewhere along the line--not overheated, he said, but hot all the same.  
Heads are losing some compression [didn't ask him for numbers over the
phone], and there's some end-play in the crankshaft.  In short, he says,
it's an old engine coming to the end of its time.  Most of you know the
drill at this point.

Whatever else, of course, he can re-torque the heads and adjust the
valves, let me put it back on the road at least for a little while, while
I get some kind of Plan B together.  Money is very tight right now, and
while that may not be the most desirable course of action, it's still the
one I may have to take for the short run.

This particular shop's style is the &quot;top-of-the-line&quot; overhaul, with new
case.  He says it'll run about $3400.  Way out of my budget.  And there
are places around town, he guessed, that would start with the original
case, etc., and do the job for perhaps $2000, although with a
corresponding reduction in total quality and lifespan of the job.  A
devil's choice.

I'm reading, and will continue to re-read, the archives on this, so I'm
not asking folks to use up bandwidth rehearsing the well-documented
options for me.  I just have a few specific questions:

1.  Do his prices on overhauls sound about right? [I'm going to start
making calls as soon as I log off from this, but a general sense would be
helpful.]

2.  Does anyone in the Portland area know this place [The Master Wrench,
on Barbur at Capitol Highway] and have any specific advice about them?  
Or know any other local place with recommendations for or against? [I had
a mechanic who seemed to know his stuff, but he's becoming
unavailable--long story.]

3.  I know that diagnosis and prognosis via email isn't exact, but is
there a reasonable rule of thumb about how much time a re-torque/re-adjust
might buy me to try and work up some other options?

[Background is not too helpful now, but for what it's worth: I've used it
for a daily driver around town for 2+ years, can probably count on one
hand the number of times I've driven more than 1/2 hour at a stretch,
rarely more than 5-10 minutes of interstate.  I live at the top of a steep
hill, so coming home every day involves a change in about 600 ft elevation
over the final mile.  The body and interior are in pretty good shape.  I
don't know anything about the history of this engine before I got the
bus.]

The garage will give me a day or so to give them an answer.  Any advice
from the brain trust will be most welcome.

Thanks in advance.

p.s. Nothing like a dying engine to put the problem with the gearshift
flexible connector into perspective, eh?
