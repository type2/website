Subject: Re: [T2] Dropping a Vanagon gas tank

I don't think it's possible to only drop one side of the tank.  Besides, if
that's an original fuel sender (metal flange instead of the plastic flanges
of the newer senders) then getting that thing off the tank can be a PITA in
and of itself and you'll want the tank on the ground so you're not dealing
with the removal &quot;blind.&quot;

Here's the link

for my write up of the procedure.

&gt; Volks,
&gt;
&gt; Well, my gas gauge quit working in the Vanagon.  Usually not a big deal
&gt; for me in a bus, as the gauges were always weak in the bays and I
&gt; am pretty used to this. Instead of filling by the gauge you fill every
&gt; 150 miles or so on the odometer, not a problem.  Alas, the vanagons have
&gt; the added joy of a weak odometer so I am now driving with a 2-gallon gas
&gt; can and filling by the gas can.
&gt;
&gt; I have a replacement sender and I know it's a matter of dropping the tank
&gt; to install it but I have never done this before.  I would love to hear
&gt; from people who have done this.  Especially I would love to hear that I
&gt; can lower the driver's side only and avoid unhooking the fill tube.  Is
&gt; this possible?
