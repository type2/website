nope I had a 74, 412 and the oil filter was same place up under the oil
filter,
also had a 1700 411 engine in my van from a 71 for a while and the oil
filter was in the same place

&gt; &gt; I recently put what I thought was a 1974 1800 bus engine into my 1972
&gt; &gt; camper. Why I never noticed, but I didnt, but the oil filler is not in
&gt; &gt; the usual place (coming out below the alternator). It is on top of the
&gt; &gt; block just above the alternator. Does anyone know why the filler is
&gt; &gt; there? Is it from a type III?
