Subject: End Play Specs

Thanks for the quick replies everyone!!
Jim's reply really got me thinking.  Since it is only a little out of 
spec and the shims do wear, this sounds quite logical, and 
wallet-friendly even!
I pulled the 3 shims from my engine ( H-case) to measure them.  I came 
up with .0133, .0134, and .0125 to give a total of .0392&quot; of shims.  
With my end play being off .0075 this would mean that my total end play 
would be .0467&quot;.  What is the shim-less end play spec?  Does anyone know 
it or was it ever even published?  Bentley just says to put 2 shims in, 
measure, and then add an appropriate 3rd shim to bring it within spec.  
Shims are available in .0134&quot; and .0126&quot; so two of my shims are only 
worn .0001&quot; each.  That is if they were in that size when NEW.  These 
would have 50,000 miles on them, but I don't know how much they wear.  
They have oil on them constantly so I would assume very very little. 

This still leaves my end play out of spec, I think.  I wish I knew what 
the shimless end play tolerances were.

So, if I put in 3 shims of .0142 (.36mm) that would bring my shimmed end 
play to .0041.  That is in the dead center of the Bentley spec.  I think 
that is the route that I will go.  3 bucks for 3 shims which could mean 
another 10-20K or more (depending on how I drive it) out of this engine, 
why not?

Opinions/rants/raves are more than welcome.

Thanks!
