&gt; &gt; Who's really to blame: the owner or VW engineering?

Neither.  Since there is a gap, either the adjuster or the valve stem has
to mushroom.  Better it be the adjuster that is softer, as it is easily
replaced.

VWs are made to be maintained.  Replacing mushroomed adjusters is a
maintainance item.
