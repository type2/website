Subject: Towed with the bus

Volks,

Last night I towed my 3200lb Mustang+driver behind my bus.  I was amazed to
find that it was no trouble at all!  Granted, I'm in Texas, where they
think that a 100ft hill is Mt. Everest, but still.  I just hooked a tow
strap to the Mustang, attached the other end to the hook on my bumper
mount, and away we went!  No drama whatsoever.  Acceleration was reduced,
but not by that much.  I guess I've heard people say for so long that you
can't tow much of anything with a 60hp bus that I had just accepted it.
Now I'm ready to go out and have a class IV hitch welded to the frame, so I
can pull a car carrier w/ electric brakes!  I can see it now, cruising
around through small towns, looking for busses, and when I find the '78
Westy that won't start for $100, I tow it home.  :-) 

As for the Mustang, it looks like either clogged injectors or bad gas...
everything else checks out.  After 172,000 miles (and a new alltime best at
the drag races last weekend), I guess it was due for a minor breakdown.
