Subject: front end replacement cost

hey guys, i have a 1978 Westfalia and i need to replace the front end. It was hit when the guy who had the bus before me rear ended some one. Now that there is this dent all the way across the front, i am gonna buy the front replacement part but i have no idea how much ill be charged for the actual work some will do on it.
   
  or will i be better off doing this on my own. i not sure if i will be to do it b/c 1.) no garage or shelter and 2.) Never welded before
   
   
  anyhelp or price guesses would be appreciated
   
  thanks
  latr
