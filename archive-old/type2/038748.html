Subject: Re: Bus tires

&gt; &gt; Anyway, I've had these Michelins for a week and have been very happy.  Oh,
&gt; &gt; she handles like a dream!  Can't wait to see how gas milage improves.
&gt; &gt; Although... anything would have been an improvement over the
&gt; &gt; cracked and balding old Yokohamas I used to have!
&gt; 
&gt;  Don't worry, be happy! I'm sure these will be fine. You might like to
&gt; try and get an opportunity to drive a bus with higher rated tyres in a
&gt; crosswind, though, you may be surprised at the difference.

However, if you start to perceive a vibration, be sure to stop and examine
the tires for a telltale lump or bulge that indicates that the tread is
about to separate soon.  Michelins seem to do this now and then with nasty
results to your bodywork.

To be fair, I've had this happen with Jupiter (Hercules) tires too, but
those were almost-worn-out standard load tires so I should have expected
it.
