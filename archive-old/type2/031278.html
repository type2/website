&gt; I have a 78 Westy, 2.0 L engine w/FI. The reference to &quot;type*&quot; has me somewhat

&gt; correct? What is the difference between a Type2 and TypeIV engine? This may be
&gt; elementary to this knowledgeable list , but is confusing to me.

it's one of the most confusing things about the bus. it's all in the
archives but to make it real simple

ALL buses, including bays, vanagons, even the new Eurovan are type 2
(usually written arabic numbers)

the models also have a type number but we usually ignore that here.

in the early 70's VW introduced the TYPE 4 car into the USA and with it
came the first totally redesigned engine of the flat four made by VW.
prior to this they were improvements on the original 1930's design.

This engine was fuel injected in the Type 4 car (411 and 412 models) when
the type 4 car sort of went bust, VW decided to put the engine into the
bus,  the engines are 1700, 1800 and 2 liter depending on the year, and in
1977 (or was it 76?) it became fuel injected.  that engine is what we
refer to on this list as the Type IV engine (usually written in Roman
numbers)

so my 78 is a 

Type 2
model 2
with a Type IV engine

because folks switch engines so much it is usually better to make it clear
what engine you are talking about when asking a question

confused yet???

hang around it will make sense shortly
