Subject: Re: [T2] STOCK DUAL CARBS TO PORSCHE 1700 L-JET FI CONVERSION QUESTIONS???

Hello List,

I would liket to thank every one for the time that
they put in replying to my Fuel Injection questions. I
think I am going to go for it. I am undecided as of
yet whether or not to go with the stock 2000cc L-Jet
stock bus fuel injection or go with the 1800cc L-Jet
stock Porsche 914 fuel injection. according to some
posts in the archives, they are almost identical. What
are your thought on that? I read that I can use the
stock 2000cc vw bus fuel injection on my 1700cc
engine. I read that it would make my bus run alittle
rich but it would still be a good settup. Any
thoughts?
I plan to buy the Bosh Fuel Injection book this week
some time. I will be reading up on it...

Thanks!

David Kelly

&gt; &gt;&gt; The Porsche regulator on the eailier 914 was
&gt; adjustable, 
&gt; a nice feature, but they stopped that when DIY'ers
&gt; kept wanting 
&gt; to turn screws that they had no way of knowing how
&gt; to set right. &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Just curious...Is this something verifiable, or
&gt; just conjecture? Or was it 
&gt; 
&gt; That's fact.  You loosen the lock-nut and turn the
&gt; screw.  Porsche specifies 
&gt; 28.5 psi as the correct setting.  I've got a
&gt; permanently mounted inline 
&gt; pressure gauge in my 74 914 2.0 and I found that
&gt; when I was in San Antonio, TX 
&gt; that 30.5 was OK - clean emisions, more power than
&gt; when set at 28.5, good mpg, 
&gt; no bad side effects.  Since moving to Colorado
&gt; Springs, I've backed it off to 
&gt; the recommended 28.5 to keep it from running too
&gt; rich.
&gt; 
&gt; Tim's comment about DIY'ers is frighteningly true. 
&gt; I don't know how many d-Jet 
&gt; manifold pressure sensors I've seen with the epoxy
&gt; drilled or chipped out and 
&gt; the factory-adjusted screw jacked with.  Turns a
&gt; perfectly good sensor into a 
&gt; paperweight - no way to correctly re-set the tension
&gt; on the diaphram.  Funny 
&gt; thing is, &quot;tuning&quot; with that particular screw gives
&gt; you absolutely no benefit.
