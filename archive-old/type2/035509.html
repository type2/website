&gt; I put on some flexible metal dryer duct.  I have not insulated it, but I
&gt; be).  Those vents are really small diameter.
&gt; 
&gt; appreciate any thoughts

I use truck flexible exhaust pipe,  it comes in a number of sizes and can
be bought in 25ft rolls (which is about what it takes to do a whole bus)
  can't find this at the local FLAPS though have to go to a wholesale
house or big truck repair shop..   

   got mine at RG Loock in Baltimore but they don't do mail order,  seem
to recall 25ft being about $50 or so

this stuff is a &quot;B***h&quot; to work with and wear heavy gloves it has sharp
edges, but when done it is durable and looks good, did mine about 3 years
ago and they show no sign of anything.
