If the twin Kadron carburettors are properly set up, I would hope that your 
otherwise stock, twin-port 1971 VW 1600 Type 2 engine, with extractor 
exhaust, gives a lot better than 18.8 MPG (US gallons, I presume!?). When in 
good condition, my family's 1973 VW 1600 Type 2, twin-port engine with 
single Minnow Fish carburettor and Monza style Scat exhaust, gave a fairly 
consistent 25 MPG (imperial gallons).

For comparison:        1 US gallon = 3.7853 litres
                 1 Imperial gallon = 4.5461 litres

Regards.
