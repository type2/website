Subject: Colour Sanding 

So I finished painting the inside of my bus last weekend and it looks .... OK.
I used Acrylic Enamel and I hear that runs are not uncommon with that type of
paint - the are certainly not uncommon on my bus now.   Actually - there are
only two runs but one of them is on the dash. So what to do ... One guy I
spoke to said sand em out and shot those spots again.  Someone else said I
should wet sand the runs and buff it out.  I'm inclined to wet sand and buff
because I think I would be able to even out the paint a bit (there are a
couple spots where the gloss is ... maybe less than what it should be) and
there are a few flecks of dust here and there.

My question.  What do I do.  Do I just get some 1500 grit and wet sand
everywhere and then buff?  How do you buff the interior?  I don't have a
buffing machine but I could get one but ... there are very few large surfaces
upon which one of those buffers would work.  Is it possible to buff by hand?
What kinda stuff do I use?  I've been using a Haynes book (Body Repair &amp;
Painting Manual) but they don't seem to talk about colour sanding.

At the end of the day I am quite happy with how it looks.  My bus is a 60 and
when I got with 35,000 original miles.  There was some serious roof damage and
the dash was in very bad shape.  The paint had all been cracked and there was
a lot of rust on the dash - only surface rust - but still ... looked kinda
bad.  So I sand blasted it and used metal ready and por-15 then tye coat
primer and high build and now paint.  I realize I went way way overboard.
Sand blasting and epoxy primer would have been fine ... but ... I did have the
por15 so ... what the hay.

Anyway - How do I colour sand??????

TIA
