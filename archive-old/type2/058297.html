Subject: Kudos to AVP

Having just completed a 3000+ mile trip in my '77 westy, I wanted to
take a moment and mention how pleased I am with my AVP rebuilt engine. 
It has proven to be very strong, powerful and used just over a quart of
oil on this trip.  I was impressed from the start with helpful, friendly
staff at AVP. And now that the engine has gone on a long trip, where I
averaged 70mph, travelling up to 14 hours with stops only for gas, I am
even more happy.  To anyone considering a crate rebuild I have nothing
but good things to say about AVP.
