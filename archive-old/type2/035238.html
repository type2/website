&gt; I have to agree with all that William Warburton said. And I have been 
&gt; thinking about some of the claims on this list that reinforce the belief 
&gt; that buses aren't reliable.

I sort of figure that as long as what I put into my bus per year is less
than the monthly payments on a new car, I am coming out ahead.

yes my 78 is a daily driver, and until just this last summer when wife
bought a SaT**n it was an only car. (and she got it because of new job in
opposite direction)

I have driven mine many thousands of miles, I bought it for $2 and drove
it home, but I have since put several thousand into it over the last 7
years (not counting the GEX fiasco)

I ski, I take it into the mountains in the winter and believe you me, I
Don't want to be sitting on the side of the road when I could be making
tracks in the powder.

Can an older van be a daily driver, yes, but it takes lots of PM
(preventive maintenance)


&gt; There is, for instance, this myth: &quot;Older things are inherently less 
&gt; reliable than newer things.&quot;

this could be true, but it is also probably caused by external factors as
often as not.

&gt; Of the critical components of a bus, the rates of wear are all very well
&gt; known, and replacement schedules are available in black and white. 

But other than Dr Tim who takes the time to do em ALL on schedule.  one or
two folks I'm sure....

&gt; The problem here is that you just cannot compare all buses against all 
&gt; Volvos or all buses against all Hondas. The most important variable in 
&gt; this whole discussion is the maintenance record of a given vehicle.

I would certainly agree with you here
but unless you have done all the maintenance or have a pretty good record
from the PO then you probably have a lot of ????? about what has and has
not been done, and what has not been done right.
&gt; 
&gt; Type2 &quot;unreliability&quot; is a stereotype, nothing more.

I'll let you know in 2 weeks when I get back from two back to back ski
trips, one of 400 miles the other over 1,000
