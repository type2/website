Subject: Re: Oh, to pass smog

While I have no experience with ether alcohol in the gas tank, I have tried 
the patent medicine available at many FLAPS that guarantees to give you your 
money back if you don't pass smog (after having run a tank of gas thru the 
engine with this stuff added). My neighbor's Geo Sprint was about 20% over 
smog limits on CO, even after we reset the carb float level as best we could 
thru the thick, parallax-inducing, view window. After the magic fluid 
treatment, it passed! Important too is to be sure the engine is hot when the 
tech finally gets around to putting the sniffer in the tail pipe.

What you might do is look at last year's results and see which limit, HC or 
CO, you were closer to exceeding. If it was the CO, then lean the mixture, 
if it was the HC then enrich the mixture, but very slightly, assuming that 
nothing else has changed in the intervening miles. Of course, dwell angle, 
timing, and plugs should be set.

We in California have to test every two years, except for '73 and earlier 
models. My van doesn't get 'grandfathered' until 2003, though my first 
grandchild is expected this January:)
