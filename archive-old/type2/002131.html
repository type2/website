        Hey there all.
Went to start the Contraption this morning and no go. It would turn over and
just barley run on the starter then quit.
I looked below and noticed the mechanical fuel pump was wet.
Pulled the pump and tried a spare but the diaphram was toast, leaked.
Tore down cleaned and rebuilt the pump with a smear of gasket maker on the
sealing surfaces and the bus starts and runs fine.
Do you think the pump wasn't pumping? I didn't replace anything in the pump.
I phoned Hans ,a VW mech. i know and he says rebuild kits arn't available.
Anyone know of a source for 72-74
mechanical fuel pump rebuild kits??

Glad the Westy is running fine but this puzzled me.
