Subject: console subwoofer enclosure?

Who was it that made that subwoofer enclosure for between the two front 
seats?

Can you send a link to that pic again, and any specs you might have?

I have mine mounted below the rear bench seat, and like most of the 
locations ive tried so far, it sounds like poo.

id like to go bandpass, which of course means more a bit*34 to build, but 
anything to make it sound good once and for all.
(and all and for once?)
