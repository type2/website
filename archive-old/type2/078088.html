Subject: Re: [T2] 15&quot; wheels and Fat Boy Muffler

Okay - where did you get adapters and how much??

The last time I researched the topic wheel adaptors were mucho-expensive 
AND the manufacturer stated that they were for light duty - whatever that 
is... &lt;grin&gt;

I too have a set of Cookie Cutter wheels and would love to run them.


&gt;I just wanted to address the thread of 15&quot; wheels for busses.  I've done 
&gt;alot of checking lately, including looking at Audi wheels, MBZ wheels, and 
&gt;new VW wheels.  New Audis have the right bolt circle, but the offset 
&gt;should be checked to see if they're OK for busses.  The same with wheels 
&gt;on new Mercedes'.  I never got quite serious enough about these wheels to 
&gt;research it myself.  New VW's don't have the correct bolt circle, so 
&gt;they're out.  I went with 15&quot; Porsche Cookie Cutters, which came stock on 
&gt;944's.  I've never seen a bus with these wheels, and I think these wheels 
&gt;look &quot;retro&quot; enough.  Since the bolt circle for Porsche wheels is 
&gt;different than bus wheels, I'm using wheel adapters.  I know some of you 
&gt;in list land don't like wheel adapters, but if they're well made, they 
&gt;shouldn't be a problem.  I ran an old Datsun auto-cross car years ago with 
&gt;wheel adapters, and that car went way faster, with much greater G-loads 
&gt;than any bus, and I never had any problems with my wheel adapters.


And I agree the only speedo calibration problems are one coming from a 
change in outside tire diameter. Bigger rim, shorter side wall. There are 
easy math equations that can help figure that.

Of course that is the reason I want 15&quot; wheels - less sidewall, less 
wander, better handling, and yes I'll be adding sway bars too.

Thanks for the good post Jim!
