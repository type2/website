I just had a significant birthday and got this great gift.
	I sold a split to another old man about a year ago and he knew it was hard
for me to let it go. He is a jeweller and for my B/day he made me a silver
copy of the original old key. Now around the neck it is great, all VW and
old style. Love it! Why not get one yourself?

50 - old enough to be in the group with hippie cred. and thus ignore Thom's
anti neo-hippie emails.
