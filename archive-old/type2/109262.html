Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for Show Single Cab, what is it going to cost?

Depends on what your opinion of &quot;perfect&quot; is. If you are wanting something
that has been restored (new engine, body work, paint etc. etc.) I am
thinking somewhere in the $7,000-$10,000 range. I am assuming you are
wanting a bay single cab? Are you open to a double cab? Check out
www.thesamba_dot_com . There are several single cabs and double cab bays in the
68-up classified section. Here is a link to a very nice 69 double cab.

&gt; My wife has given me the okay to buy a perfect clean single cab, the only
&gt; catch is that I can't do anything to it, so it must be perfect.  What is
it
&gt; going to cost me?
&gt;
&gt; Anyone know of a good one for sale?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
