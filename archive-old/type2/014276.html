Subject: RV Roof AC Unit Cheap

I've got a Coleman Mach II rooftop AC unit for an RV.
It is about 7200 btu and was serviced about a year ago.
It is too heavy to put on a West roof and it will not work at the 24-30
degree incline on Westy roof.
It has to be on a flast roof.
It is about a 1978 model, the cover is in good condition with reinforced
corners etc. Original White top and grey bottom.
The air distributor is in good condition and the system has a thermostat.
It is located in Dallas Texas, you'll have to come get it since it weighs
about 90 pounds it isn't worth the freight expense for long distance
shipping.
Asking $200.00. I'll plug it in and run it when you come for it.
