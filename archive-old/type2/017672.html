&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; Looks like the seals on my steering box are shot!
&gt; There is oil all round it :-(
&gt; 
&gt; Can I add oil until I can get around to
&gt; repairing/replacing it?

Yes! By all means, top it up! Another thing that might help is adding a
part bottle of auto trans seal conditioner. I've never tried it on a
steering box, but it sure works on transmissions. Makes the seals soft
again. And really you have nothing to lose. Running low on grease is
sure to wear it out rapidly.
