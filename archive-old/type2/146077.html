Subject: Re: [T2] Corvair Powered Bus (Transvair)

Here I am. Specs: 1965 Corvair 110 HP (all stock), 3.55 4 speed gearbox, trans-vair kit. 

Am 95% done. Only have fuel lines and a little bit of cooling left. 

Have alot of Corvair internet resources. 

How can I help? 

Suggested Google hunts: Ultravan. BIG RV with normal Corvair powertrain. They deal with all the sorts of issues we do such as hot days, heavy loads, etc. If a particular idea works on an Ultravan, it will work better on a Trans-vair! I think there is also a Corvair van list somewhere. I'd start looking at www.corvair_dot_org , smae problems, good solutions. 

I need to learn alot more so let's talk. 

As for starting a new list I think we'd be a bit lonely! I suggest keeping the discussion right here but putting &lt;Transvair&gt; in the subject line so the archives gain whatever we learn, and the non-Corvair powered folks know to delete, delete, delete. I know Type2 was the first place I started looking for info. 

See ya!

'99 CR-V 2,0L 

See a theme here? &lt;grin!&gt; 

Long term plans are 140HP based engine with full EFI and header exhaust. I'm seeing numbers on the web of 165-175HP with good reliability.
