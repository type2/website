Chris,
what you need to do is just move out of state:)   im
in omaha, but still a resident of NY, so ive been
running on my 10 day goin on 2 years now:)   as soon
as i hit the NY border for trips home, i have 10 days
to get the vehicle inspected.   im never in NY that
long for visits home, so its full proof! LOL   sounds
like the bus is coming along well, keep up the good
work!

&gt; The parts arrived late last night. I'm on day 43 of
&gt; a 10-day temp inspection
&gt; sticker. I changed the date 3 times and and the
&gt; month once with no trouble, but there's no easy way
&gt; to change APR to MAY so
&gt; again I'm up against it. Change 3 of the four
&gt; rubber brake lines and the right rear metal brake
&gt; line, which had stripped and
&gt; snapped. My shoes don't fit. Have to send
&gt; them back to the Depot. I think they have trouble
&gt; with the 72 shoes. New
&gt; cylinders, stars, screws and star anchor plates
&gt; went in okay, except knocking the old star anchors
&gt; off with a pickle fork and 5
&gt; lb sledge was causing some consternation with my 95
&gt; year old neighbor, even
&gt; though it was only 9pm - I agreed to call the
&gt; operation off until this
&gt; afternoon.
