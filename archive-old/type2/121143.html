Subject: Couple items for sale

Trying to make some room in the garage. Couple itemsI have moved around 
more than once!!
First a set of black headrests. Molded vinyl. Need to be cleaned ,but no 
holes or tears. I think from a late bay? Look like the ones in my 78 
Westy only they are black. $10.00 for the pair plus shipping.
I also have a set(4)of the artificial raingutters. They were on my westy 
top before removed them filled the holes and painted it. Need a quick 
coat of spray paint,but in good shape. $10.00 for the set plus shipping. 
Last, I am replacing the interior of my 78 Westy with the interior that 
has a fridge and stove instead of a ice box/sink. It is green/yellow 
plaid.  Some of the laminate is damaged in places.  Right now I have the 
rear folding seat ready for pick up. The rest of the cabinets shortly. 
Make me an offer on that stuff. Interested let me know. All located in 
Mystic,CT

Bill
