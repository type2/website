Subject: RE: [T2] Electrical woes... still

I read in the type 2 library ( http://www.dolphinsci_dot_com/relay.html )that in
this relay the coil should be in the circuit. (Just applying 12V to the
trigger input is not enough. The circuit relies on the higher voltage pulse
that is generated by the coil when the points open.) could this be why I
have an empty male spade connector on my coil?
http://members.bellatlantic_dot_net/~vze3t2qs/bus/engine006.jpg  Or does that
only apply to the type IV motor that he's discussing?

I'm looking at the wiring diagram for 76 model Westy's in the Bently
manual... but can't seem to find exactly where in the diagram you are
talking about...

Now for the interesting part... just went out to my bus to trace those
wires...  Can't really tell if it's a red w/blue strip or red w/black
strip... (with a flashlight) the brown is definitely brown w/black strip,
both of these wires go out through the lower right corner of the firewall...
every wire in that group, (that's going through the hole in the firewall) is
butt connected ( I think that's what they're called... small tube, put one
wire in one end, one wire in the other end, crimp the wires in...)  SO if
they've all been replaced from the firewall on... what color they are
doesn't even matter right?  AND the black wire connected to that relay, goes
to the coil...

(THE GAME IS AFOOT!)

&gt; The wires going to the relay that you identified as a newer vanagon
&gt; fuel pump relay look suspicously like the wires that should be on the
&gt; fuel pump control section of the double relay.. the only large red blue
&gt; wire i can find is the fuel pump pos lead.which is supposed to be
&gt; connected to the double relay. the only brown lead i can find in that
&gt; area is the ground for the double relay. Note that the double relay has
&gt; a couple of circuits inside of it that if they go bad you could
&gt; actually get a slow drain because it is leaving circuits active.  From
&gt; your year and type of engine i am sitting here with the wiring diagrams
&gt; and it is looking like somebody did a hack around the problem wiring
&gt; fix to something and has left you with the difficulty of trying to
&gt; figure it out.  Very possible that the fuel pump control side of the
&gt; double relay went bad.  my opinion without being able to get my hands
&gt; on it.
