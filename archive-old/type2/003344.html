I was driving my '69 Westy only a block from my house yesterday when i
noticed a funky-looking white bus with a big black grill on the front and no
windows on the side.  I went to check it out and the kind,kind owner came
out to chat. she said it is registered in Mexico all the time as she goes
there for one month a year. (she said she only pays $200/year for insurance)
But anyway, the bus looks like a '78 or somethin'('cept for the grill) but i
was informed that it is a '92!

I knew that VW still was producing these old-style type2's, but this is the
first i have seen in person.  The owner is in the process of restoring the
interior and she is looking for a two of the jalouise (sp?) crank windows
for the midsection of her bus.

If anyone has/knows of a source for new or used windows like these, could
you please let me know?
I told her i would try to help her out. :)

thanks for any help,
I hope all volks will enjoy this fine day.
