&gt; If a mechanical EGR ('76 on) is attached to the air plenum without the

&gt; tell whether it seals at the top of its action or the bottom, or both.

Having recently replaced a mechanical EGR valve with a rebuilt one,
I have to say no.  The valve doesn't seal absolutely air-tight.  Just like
the FI auxiliary air regulator does not seal air-tight.

The valve is spring loaded to remain in the closed position.  Closed is
when the lever arm on the valve is to the left (in case your spring has
sprung).  When the throttle positioner moves open, a pushrod between it
and the lever arm pulls the EGR valve open.

&gt; The answer to this riddle will be applied to a temporary condition, as I 
&gt; prevent a nasty vacuum link while trying to find pipe and linkage.

My EGR pipe broke at the flange on the EGR valve.  I sealed off the flanges
on my broken pipe and hit the junkyards to find a better pipe.  I actually
found two usable EGR pipes.  If you want my spare, email me.

Using the lids from a vegetable can and the old flanges, I made some metal
gaskets to seal this up tight.  I traced the flanges onto the can lids,
cut them out and drilled the 2 mounting holes.  With some of the red exhaust
goop smeared on them they sealed nicely.  Temporarily.  Within weeks, I
was removing them and installing a better EGR pipe and new EGR valve.
