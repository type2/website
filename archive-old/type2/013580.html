&gt;at the FLAPS near you, as you try and convince the Chevy owners that an
&gt;air-cooled engine is a reliable beast.


next thing you know you
&gt;will be hanging with them at the local pub drinking Guiness and complaining

Charlie:

No offense to anyone who owns a Chevy, but I don't think they're typical Guinness drinkers.  Maybe Bud or Coors, but definitely not Guinness.
