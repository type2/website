&gt; &quot;So you've bought a CDI or Pertronix or upgraded your ignition system

&gt; the same article says it could go from 16 to 26 mpg!
&gt;
&gt; I'd be happy to increase it a few mpg!  does installing an electronic
&gt; system really help and if so, which is recommended?  And the cost
&gt; woudl be about $180. (I thought it would be about $100) Also, do I
&gt; need to get replace my distributor, the lobes have worn down.


I've used the Pertonix for years and like the no adjusting of points and
stability of the system and reliability, BUT I have seen no difference in
MPG   same before and same after if there is a difference it is so small
as to be unnoticable.

you shouldn't have to replace your distributor with a pertronix
