Subject: Re: [T2] Throwing in the towel on my louvers

&gt; hehehe.. you're like me. I hate those things. They leak a ton of air 
&gt; into the back and rattle like crazy. 

For some reason the jalousies have been on my wifes hit list since we got the bus over a year ago, by hit list I mean that she finds a few things a year to obsess over killing and removing from her environment, I usually hold her off by arguing the ROI of a project with hours versus the warm fuzzy feeling of completion, it helps but doesn't keep her from obsessing internally.

I like to keep some things like this original, I modify some things, I can't explain my selection process, but I have a list of projects I want to do (in my head) that is in the hundreds and this one can't even see the top, so I am giving up on this one to get rid of the wind noise, the rattling, and the nagging.

I can hang on to the 4 windows and when I retire in 35 years I will have the 2 weeks to restore them.

Thanks,
JM
