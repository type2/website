&gt; Hi Everybody!
&gt; One of the previous owners of my '78 Westy gutted the heating system, all
&gt; that remains are the naked fins of the heat exchangers. I am wondering how
&gt; well the stock system worked in the first place, is it worth replacing all
&gt; those pricey bits?

personal opinion only

  I have a 78 and drive it year round, and ski so I drive in some pretty
cold places.   in any case my heating system was totally shot when I got
the bus (8 years ago) 
   I have totally removed the heating system including the fins, so I have
naked pipes.   what I have done is put a gas heating system under the
front of the bus taking the imput air from behind the dash and routing it
back into the central duct above the front beam.
   When it is working right I can drive with a light jacket unzipped in
below zero weather with the wind blowing....durning the summer I disconect
the flame blower and gas pump and use the air blowers for defrost, I used
the A/C blowers for the heat when I removed what was left of the A/C

&gt; Memories of my '62 Type 1 and '76 Super Beetle &quot;heaters&quot; during Minnesota
&gt; winters have left me suspicious about how effective heat in a bus could be.
&gt; My Westy is garaged all winter, so when it gets brisk during the spring and
&gt; fall months we just dress warm and use an electric ceramic heater (110v) and
&gt; the dogs to take the edge off at night when we're camping.
&gt;
