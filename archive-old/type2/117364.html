Subject: Rear Window Defogger Grid 

Hi Barry, 

	Early grids were made up of copper foil ribbon soldered together
at the junctions.  Prior to the repair kits with conductive glue, ribbon
repair kits were common in FLAPS. You can still buy the foil in 1/8&quot;,
1/4&quot;, etc ribbons with self adhesive on it.  One source was suppliers to
slot car raceways, others are alarm window foil(RadioShack), and
electronic suppliers.  Make up your own grid pattern. Modified VW logo
would be possible. change direction by folding, think origami, not cutting
and joining.  You need a couple of 'bus bars' at the sides which should be
made out of thicker or wider ribbon.  Scrape the ribbon clean where it
overlaps and quickly solder it with low temp solder.  Solder paste is
best.  Connect the 'bus bars' to the defogger supply and see how it works.

	Since you are talented enough to make, or have made, detailed
masks to sand blast the images on the window you could make a mask to have
a window partially silvered.  It would take a couple of shots empirically
or a few questions to a knowledgeable glass coatings engineer to get the
correct area/thickness relationship figured for the resistance you needed.  
One result might be a crying bus defogged area on your back window or
Jerry slowly appearing out of the mist as you drove home from a concert.

I need to re-grid my entire rear window. I scraped the window and the grid 
smooth and clean with a razor blade.
