Subject: Mix in gas tank

Hello Volks

I live in Venezuela and we have a general strike since 30 days now as you can
figure everything is hard to find including gas. Since the gas you can find at
the gas stations are not certified I was guessing if I use an outboard mix I
have (40 parts gas 1 part two stroke oil).
I was wondering if this mix 20 liters plus 40 liters of regular gas could make
some damage to the engine or just some smoke.
Any advice will be highly appreciate, I don not planning to do this as a
regular basis but we are passing through a hard times

Greetings and happy holidays from the sunny lands of Caracas Venezuela
