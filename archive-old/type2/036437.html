Subject: lighter questions

Hi everyone, 
    Excuse me for being a little behind the power
curve, however, i bought a '78 Transporter and it
doesn't have a cigarette lighter.  I've searched the
archives and found nothing about installation or where
i can find parts.  Please shed some light on this. 
I'm looking to install one.  

Thanks
Chrissie and Gertie
