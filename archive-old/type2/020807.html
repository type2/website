&gt; The tube that carries the main wiring harnes from the engine compartment,
&gt; does go thru the frame members as I remember (it's been 5-6 years :-).
&gt; It is about an inch in diameter and goes down to the right of the main
&gt; heater tube, looking forward. On mine, the tube was about 60% missing
&gt; because of rust, so preservation was not possible, but a run of (?3/4&quot; or
&gt; was it 1'?)  thinwall electrical conduit contained the harness nicely.
&gt; As I remember, I had the engine and trans out and fed the tube in from the
&gt; rear, but I would really want to go home and look before I got definite[1]
&gt; The body I am talking about is a '73, BTW.  One thing fersure, if you have
&gt; a different year, you may have a different arrangement

Steve, Dave:
Later buses got rid of this tube, I think by 76 it was gone. I'd just find some
rubber covered hose supports and screw it to the inside of the mail frame rail.
Seems like I did this on my 69 double cab, rather than having the harness support
the remains of the tube. (I split it off with  a tin snips.)
