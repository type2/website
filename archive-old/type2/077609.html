Subject: RE: [T2] RE: Coils

&gt;I had a coil that was failing in a Mercedes. (Bosch Blue) It ran 
&gt;fine until it warmed up then it would miss regularly. I was 
&gt;working for an older guy who said that if it only missed when 
&gt;warm that was the first thing to try. Replaced the coil and that was it.

Hmmm.  Very interesting.  I'm trying to track down an intermittent &quot;hiccup&quot; and 
have had no success as yet.  It doesn't do it at idle, and I don't notice it at 
full throttle.  But at light-to-medium cruising speeds (any gear, any speed, 
any RPM) it just &quot;hiccups&quot; every minute or so (no particular timing to it, just 
on average about once a minute).  I'll try swapping out for the coil from my 58 
and see if it fixes it...

Thanks.
