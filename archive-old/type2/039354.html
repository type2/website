Subject: Re: idle problem in 73 dual carb

&gt;so im not the brightest light on the ferris
&gt;wheel:).....anyways i appreciate all the advice i
&gt;receive on this great list.   heres the update, went
&gt;to my local flaps and bought some rubber hose and
&gt;clamps, and proceeded to replace all old cruddy vacuum
&gt;lines and clamp them down, screwed the main idle screw
&gt;OUT:), but lizzy stiil refuses to idle.

Sorry about the delayed reply - I've been out of town.

If you are turning the idle adjusting screw and there is no change in idle,
then your idle shutoff solenoid is probably stuck.  This is a common
occurance with the dual carbs.  The idle shutoff solenoid is at the very
front (Front Is Front) of the left carb, next to the tin.  It is also
larger in diameter than the other, similar looking solenoid on the carb.  I
have always had trouble with this solenoid - the best I was able to do was
to get one to work 90% of the time.  It would still occasionally stick
closed.  So, I stacked up a few washers underneath the solenoid before
screwing it in, so that even when it was closed, it still allowed air
through.  I have been running it that way for five years now.  I believe
it's purpose was to prevent run-on after the key is shut off, but I don't
have a problem with that, YMMV.
