Subject: What Engine is This?

&gt; Another ? - according to the VIN, my bus is a Kombi, but everything
&gt; I read about them is that they should have two bench seats.  My bus
&gt; has the table and rear folding bed/seat with a top mounted rear
&gt; &quot;cabinet&quot;.  It also has louvered windows.  Is this a Kombi or did
&gt; someone in the past try to make it a &quot;pseudo- camper&quot;

These are not pseudo-campers. They were built by Westfalia. I've seen a
couple down through the years. Ex-husband donated the one I'm describing
here to a convent in Mexico around 10-15 years ago. In March 1973, we bought
this new 1972 camper from the VW dealer (Wester, I think) in Monterey
California. It was solid Sierra Yellow (breast-fed baby poo yellow, don't
ask me how I know). It did not have: a pop-top, sink/icebox, rear quarter
closet, electrical outlets, seat behind driver. The bulkhead behind the
front seats where the seat and the sink/icebox usually lives was paneled
with the baltic birch. There was a bracket behind the driver's seat to
attach the stool to. It did have: yellow/gold vinyl upholstery on the Zbed
and stool, jalousie windows with screens/curtains, stool, kids cot up front,
full-width Z bed, full width storage cabinet with a door above the
&quot;way-back&quot; area in the rear, storage under the back seat without an access
door (with cutouts on either side to store the kids cot), the darker formica
paneling on the cabinetry in the back, the light gray vinyl flooring in the
back, the table hinged under the jalousie window on the driver's side, the
light fixture over the table, a dome light for the front. The front of the
bus was standard, tan basket weave seats, etc. 

It was a great bus and I wish the ex had given me a chance to buy it from
him. Where are you? Perhaps it found its way back from Mexico to a loving
home in the US. Wouldn't that be a hoot?
