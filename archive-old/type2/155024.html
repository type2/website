Subject: Square headed set screws in shift linkage

Any of you that have had to deal with the shift linkage under your bus know
that the shift rods and rear coupling are secured by set screws with square
heads.  The normal socket for dealing with square hardware is an 8 point
socket.  I don't have any 8 point metric sockets so I tried my SAE sized 8
point sockets.  It turns out that a 5/16 inch, 8 point socket, works just
fine.  Using a socket, instead of an open end wrench or other tool, makes it
easy to use a torque wrench to tighten the set screws when your putting it
all back together.
