Subject: Muffler styles for 75-78 Westy

The &quot;original&quot; muffler on my 78 Westy is a tube centered under the
bumper, having a pipe exiting on the left side to bolt to the heater box
directly; the right side has a tail pipe and another bent pipe going to
the other heater box.  The same &quot;rusty&quot; one is on a 75 I'm fixing, and
the one sent by the bus depot looks more like a beetle muffler with
pipes to the heaterboxes joining at the center and then having a bolt on
oval muffler that extends too rearward and rather far to the right.  (I
can send a pic if asked) -This fits poorly under the heat shield, and I
question that it breathes as well; can anyone send me a pic of the
pacesetter one that Ron says is an alternate that looks more like mine? 
The pic on the &quot;Whipeme&quot; site is the same for all muffer details!

&gt; I saw a nice one piece unit in jcwhitney for like 80 bucks made by
&gt; pacesetter that replaces all three pieces if you can run without the
&gt; cat.converter legally. Have not tried it but probably will order one for my
&gt; 82 westy soon.
