Subject: Re: [T2] CD player that actually fits into VW dash?

I've had several modern DIN-type stereos in my buses. I've never done any
cutting, only a little &quot;tweaking&quot; (had to use a flat punch to open up the
corners a tiny bit) of the opening to fit the sleeve. I'm currently running
a Kenwood head unit, but have also used Sony, Alpine and Aiwa successfully.
It takes a little patience to get everything worked into place, but I've
never had to cut one yet!
