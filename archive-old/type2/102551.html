Subject: Re: [T2] Leaky Valve Covers

Guys,

I always glue mine with 3m weatherstrip(yellow) for t1 and t4 
engines...haven't had a valve cover oil leak in years.  Change gaskets 
about every 3rd or 4th oil change just for good luck....

Take your valve covers and get another tab or two welded on 
and see if it helps!....and let us know...

Cheers, dave

&gt; My 914-4 sucks valve cover gaskets almost everytime I autocross it.  The
&gt; gaskets deform and suck in along the bottom edge and oil poors out (I've
&gt; never glued my gaskets).  I have the same problem on my bus, but not nearly
&gt; as often.  One possible cause of sucking gaskets is insufficient crankcase
&gt; ventilation.
&gt; 
&gt; I always thought VW's design on the type IV motor valve covers was pretty
&gt; half-assed.  If they'd put TWO tabs on each side instead of the one in the
&gt; middle it would have taken care of the problem once and for all.
