got a package from Nikki today, something she found in the desert that you
can't get around here BUT

it arrived having been opened for inspection, had a big stamp on it saying

&quot;CERTIFICATION  this piece does not contain any parcels that match a
security profile jointly espablished by the FAA and USPS&quot;

their checking up on you, thought my heat shield was a bomb or something!!

Thanks, that made my day

Bob
