Subject: cot

I am looking for somebody.  A few months ago I sold somebody the upper
fold out cot from a 73 westy.  Last week I found a part that should have
gone with the cot.  It is the rubber bumper that attaches to the roof
and I guess keeps the cot from laying directly on the roof of the bus
when the cot is folded up.  I didn't save the persons e-mail address or
name so,  If you recently acquired a cot from me, let me know and I will
send the part right out.  If it doesn't get claimed in a couple of weeks
I'll give it to somebody else who need it.
