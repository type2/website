Ladies, Gentlemen, (and the rest of you, too)

Right at the moment, the list backlog is approaching 200 messages, and 
growing.  The oldest message in the queue is now from 11/02! *Please* stop 
it on the counting! *Please* keep it on topic!  Traffic is way up all of a 
sudden, and if we overload things, then no one gets anything!
