Hi Volks,

our list admin Steve Dolan wrote to the List (among lots of stuff 
that I agree with wholeheartedly):

&gt; Third, killed is killed.  After you see a &quot;kill this message&quot; post *-from
&gt; me*- stop posting!  I will allow about a half hour lag for messages still
&gt; in the pipe, after that measures will be taken.  

Erm... I'm afraid that's too short for those who are on digest mode.  
Please make sure that the digest containing the kill post has been 
distributed before taking measures.

ObBusContent: Anyone know where I could get the clips by which the 
inner cover of the sliding door (in commercial vans) and rear hatch 
are attached?  They don't seem to be available anywhere here in 
Germany, but it seems you have a more enthusiastic parts industry in 
the US.  Any hints would be appreciated.

Thanks,
    Erik.
