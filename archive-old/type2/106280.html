What a nice weekend!
It all started on Thursday afternoon when I met Ted
&quot;The guy with the cherries&quot; Finesman and Frank &quot;Chili
King&quot; Biffath at Ted's store in Cincinnati. After a
parting photo taken by an innocent by-stander we were
on the road.
Route 52 east along the Ohio river was our first leg
of the trip. 75 degrees, sunshine, nice 2 lane road
running through the some of the most beautiful country
Ohio has to offer. One word: &quot;NICE!&quot;
Darkness fell and we decided to take advantage of the
interstate route since there is no scenery in the dark
anyway. It seems like we covered more ground in the
last 3 hours than we did in the first 8 hours.  About
1:00 am on Friday morning we rolled into the
campground.  Of course we were all still wired from
the drive and the coffee, so we stayed up for a couple
of hours enjoying some cool refreshments. About 3:00
am or so, we retired to our respective Westy's for a
crash.
I awoke at 6:45 am on Friday to the loudest racket I
have ever heard that early in the morning. It seems
Frank thought that this would be a good time to
construct his new 10x10 nylon\aluminum shelter... Oh
wait, that was me waking Frank up with the shelter
building! Sorry Frank!
Anyway, the Canadians made a FABULOUS pancake
breakfast for us to enjoy, thanks again Greg Potts and
Crew!  The rest of friday was spent hanging out and
getting re-aquainted with people and meeting some new
folks, and with Frank trying to decide whether or not
to move his camp site across the road right next to
the only fire pit in the area. Any of you who know
Frank, already know which decision he made!!  After
Frank moved his bus, it was time to run into town for
some supplies and a quick oil change for Franks
HapyBus in the parking lot of AutoZone (a long story
which should have its own post dedicated to it;^)
Friday night we found out that there was no community
breakfast planned for Saturday morning. I crashed
early at about 10:00 pm and woke up on Saturday
morning feeling great!
Let me just tell you how good I felt Saturday morning!
Well, that lasted for about an hour and a half. Then
Frank rounded up me and Ted for a mission.  We (the
OVT) were going to make breakfast for everyone.  I
thought that Ted and I had finally talked Frank out of
this idea, when he said: &quot;We'll just start cooking for
3 people and whoever joins us, joins us! If you cook
it they will come!&quot;  Well, we started with 2 pounds of
sausage, 1 dozen eggs, and 1 pack of tortillas.  As
soon as people started smelling the sausage and coffee
cooking, they began to appear out of the woodwork.
People brought veggies, more meat, eggs, salsa,
cheese, etc. Before we knew it, Greg Potts had joined
us on the stoves and when it was all said and done I
think we fed at least 50-60 people breakfast burritos.
To Frank: You are truly a man with a vision! (even if
it is double-vision sometimes!!)
So breakfast ends and we have a quick meeting of the
Ohio Valley Tribe to get prepared for the rest of the
day.
Saturday afternoon saw Chili cooking, guitar
strumming, and enjoying the weather which went from a
short period of wet and crappy to a glorious sunny
after noon!
I am sure that I don't have to tell you that Frank
repeated as the EB Chili cook-off champion, which just
goes to show that if you have a big enough kettle,
it's got to be filled with good stuff.  After the
dinner festivities and awards it was back to the camp
fire. BTW, WHO BUILT THAT FIRE?!?!  The park personnel
were very nice and kept Frank stocked up with good
fire wood, and one of the park guys even sat down with
us and picked out some VERY good tunes on my guitar. I
didn't know that such good sounds were even possible
on that guitar!  But all good things must come to an
end and Sunday morning's cleanup arrived right on
schedule.  We broke camp pretty early and were on the
road by 8:30 am, well 9:30 with the time change.
The ride went really well, oil temps were running low,
and the buses were climbing the mountains like champs.
Then the further north we got, the colder it became.
By the time we hit Central West Virginia, it was quite
nippy. As we crossed into Ohio the bottom dropped out
and temperatures fell even further.  Ahhhhh, welcome
to Southern Ohio in April, only three days ago we were
driving with the windows down, and now its spitting
snow flakes.  But we eventually made it home.
It was a great trip, Ted &amp; Frank are probably 2 of the
best travellling companions one could wish for.  Also
a couple of other thanks to Chris for putting the show
on, to my neighbor Dan (the guy from Key West who
lived in his bus) who helped me out with the proper
attitude adjustment first thing on Friday Morning. To
Greg Potts and the Canadian Crew for a great breakfast
on Friday and for doing it again on Saturday, to Mark
Dearing for a steady supply of &quot;Bug Droppings&quot;, to the
Park personnel for supplying the firewood and tunes.
And to everybody else who made this a very enjoyable weekend.

&quot;So we got into the red VW microbus with the shovels and the rakes and
the implements of destruction and we headed on to the police officer's
station...&quot;
