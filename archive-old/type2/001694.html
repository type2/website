Hi All ,

   We have an oil leak in the back area on our 78 van. The engine runs OK
and has OK compression. I have eliminated the rear crank seal, the valve
covers, the oil cooler, the oil pump, the oil filler pipe ,the oil filter
and the dip stick tube. The only thing I can think of is that maybe one of
the oil pressure relief valves is sticking and forcing too much oil to the
top of the engine at high RPM . There is evidence of oil on the electric fan
above the oil breather and oil inside the air intake ducting.
  So, does that sound like a good theory? Can too much oil pressure force
oil out the oil breather?

Thanks,
Neil Sundberg
