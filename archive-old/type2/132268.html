&gt; I thought this was correct as well, but since our friend seemed quite
&gt; confident that the holes are spaced different I went out to the garage
&gt; to look. On both a web cam and stock cam shaft the holes are not equal
&gt; distance from each other.

Yes, I stand corrected on this. The bolt holes ARE indexed and there is only
one way to bolt on the cam gear to the cam.
