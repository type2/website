Subject: ignition improvements

Folks,

We have talked over the relative merits of compufire v.s. pertronix, but I 
would like to hear from folks who have actually installed some of the late 
model CDI units...ones I can buy on the open market today.

Better, worse, same?

Old coil ok, new coil necessary?

I see John sells Mallory, Ron sells Crane...some are pushing MSD

Who has installed which..and how did it work and what was included?

Do all of them have a bypass switch?...if the &quot;booster&quot; fails?

Did they include the &quot;points&quot; replacement...was it optical(compufire?) or
&quot;hall&quot; effect like pertronix....don't know about the crane unit.  Will 
they work from &quot;regular&quot; points?  

Can you use your old &quot;blue&quot; coil, or can you sue one of the &quot;silver&quot;
coils that require an electronic trigger?

I just can't seem to find enough info at the various suppliers to make an
informed decision.

I just want to compare and think about it!

Cheers, dave.
