Subject: Re: [T2] oil sheen

that is what causes the oil to blow out there? i am losing oil out the
hose that comes off the oil filler. i thought i was leaking from the
valve cover because it is covered in oil, but then i realized it was
dirty cuz oil was dripping on it. someone told me once that back pressure
with blow it out there, too, so when i saw this happening, i got scared.
if this could be the problem, it is a simple fix... i think i will look
into it.
