&gt; Your long-time VW mechanic is partially right. 
&gt; The 30PICT is a far better
&gt; carb - but for 1500/1600 SINGLE Port Engines. 

Most of the guys who wax poetic about the old
30's and 28 carbs do so because there was no air
bypass circuit.  Adjustments were done with the
ONE screw on the side and the throttle positioner
screw.  

The new 30/31s available to day are similiar to
the old 30PICT3 that came on the US spec 70
westy.  They DO have an air bypass circuit and
are just as finicky as a 34PICT3.  

Happy bussin'
