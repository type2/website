Subject: RE: [T2] Is a aircooled vanagon ECU different between automatic
  and  manual transmissions?

&gt; I know in the Bay window busses they had different ECU's....I figure this
&gt; probably had something to do with duration of the injector pulse, or
&gt; something..........
&gt;
&gt; Any advice is appreciated.


I was once told by my rebuilder that an ECU from an auto would work fine in
a manual, but that he wasn't sure if the opposite would work....
