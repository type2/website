Grant and others:
As I recall from my reading of this system it worked differently.

First, I thought it was only on '74 specifically but it could well have been
on all dual carb Type 4 Buses.

There were 2 components to the system:  a switch on the transaxle (much like
the backup light switch) which told it when it was in 4th gear, and an
electrically operated valve next to the heater blower in the engine room.
Oh yeah, and also a temp switch somewhere but I don't remember where :-)

This system was called vacuum advance cutoff.  I could have sworn that it
worked the opposite as described below, that it cut off vacuum advance when
the engine was in 4th gear at above the specified temperature.

I would reread the section but I am out of town and my Bentley is not
accessible.  It was some sort of bizarro emissions control device, and I
remember thinking it was '74 only because it was right before FI came out in
'75 and did away with all those air pumps and vacuum advance cutoffs.

So no, you should not lose the faith unless you have a '74 VW Bus where this
system is still connected and working :-) -- I don't think I've seen one
intact yet.

&gt; I just read on page 73 of Bentley's Engine &amp; Clutch chapter that the vac
&gt; advance had a temperature switch and was cut off in all but 4th gear at 54
&gt; degrees.
&gt;
&gt; Well, like every other up to date VW person I have gotten religion on the
&gt; subject of vac advance, and its superior ability to respond to load not
just
&gt; RPM.  Now I find that  (at least here in the balmy latitudes) it was
turned
&gt; off most of the time.  Saint Hoover save us!  Should I doubt my faith?
Can
&gt; I spend that $400 I was saving for a Mallory vac advance dizzy on slow
women
&gt; and fast gin?
&gt;
