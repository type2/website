&gt; A little addenum to the T4 rebuiling tirade.  I picked up a copy

&gt; day and really like the little thing.  This one is a '71-'74
&gt; edition and has all specs for T1,2,3,4 manufactured during those 
&gt; years. Basically all the spec sections from the ends of the Bentley
&gt; chapters for all of those cars, any model, for those years and
&gt; specs from the owners manuals for dimensions, etc.

Hey there Volks,

If anyone is interested in seeing what this VW service &quot;without
guesswork&quot; manual is all about Thom at http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/
(click on online manuals) has recently hosted the Obsolete Air-Cooled
Documentation Project which has scans of the '69 and '72 copies.
You'll need a PNG file format viewer, tho.

Later...
