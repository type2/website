Subject: Re: [T2] Belly Pan?

My Westfalia has a &quot;belly pan&quot; that runs from the crossmember that the spare
tire carrier attaches to back to just short of the nose of the transmission.
I presume it's there to protect the gas-fired heater the Westy has, which my
regular Vanagon doesn't.  Don't know if that's the &quot;belly pan&quot; in mind that
started this thread(s).  It's held in place by hex-head screws of the
&quot;sheetmetal&quot; sort.

&gt; Belly Pan?
&gt;
&gt; This is interesting.  I've got two buses and the only pan that I am
&gt; aware of sits under the steering column and protects the
&gt; accellerator and brake linkage.  If there is a pan that covers the
&gt; entire undercarriage, I've never seen it.  Both of my buses are
&gt; pretty intact stock, and neither of them have any pan that even
&gt; remotely runs the length of the vehicle and covers the beams and
&gt; crossmembers and such.... or maybe I am not understanding what a
&gt; belly pan is.  The only thing that protects my undercarriage is a
&gt; healthy coating of undercoat applied by the VW dealership when my
&gt; father was the original purchaser 27 years ago.  Is one of these
&gt; pans year specific?  Earlier buses certainly had better assembly and
&gt; quality of machining, that much is evident to anyone who has ever
&gt; taken apart a dash or window regulator on a TypeIIa bay vs. a
&gt; TypeIIb bay.  Hmmm.
