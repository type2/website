Subject: Replace Heater/Vent levers 68-71

Hey all ....

I've recently obtained a set of replacement heater/vent levers (the end with
the knobs) as was wondering
if anyone had a procedure for R&amp;Ring them.  Near as I can tell, it has to be
done from the front side (FIF)
of the dash. It looks like if I pull the radio and the glovebox, I -might-
have enough room to work up there.

Anybody been there, done that?

Thanks.
