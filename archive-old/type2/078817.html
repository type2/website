Subject: vacuum leak?

Howdy Volks
Finally getting around to see why my 71 westy 1600DP was running rough. What 
it was doing was SERIOUS hesitation upon acceleration. It was doing it for a 
while, then was fine for a while, now back to bad. Ayway, did the usual 
valve adjust/check head torque. So I started her up and it was rough on the 
idle. It would idle low then kind of rev on its own, then go back to a rough 
ticking (not valve ticking, but another kind) then rev then tick, then 
afterr about 60 seconds or so idle, but idle high (maybe 1200rpm).Checked 
dwell (52degress, just on the high side but should be ok) when I went onto 
checking timing. ok at idle (recheked statically later - ok) but when I went 
to check timing at advance by pulling the throttle it would cut out. As soo 
as I started pulling the throttle I would hear a loud whooshing - much like 
lettin the air out of something. So sounds to me like an exhaust leak. It 
sounded like it was coming from the right side, maybe under the generator.
So..from what I've read I can spray carb cleaner to see if it idles higher 
(or more or less normal). But what do I spray it on? And if I find 
something, what do I do? (I suppose that depends where it is, duh) Any 
suggestions as to:
1. where this might be occuring?
2. techniques for diagnosing?
3. possible solutions for different possible problems?
4. am I on the right track here?

Thanks mucho
wink
