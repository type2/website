The single most valuable tool for body work is a 7&quot; grinder.  Its slightly less
powerful sisters and brothers are buffer/polisher/sanders.  The working end of
the grinder is fitted with a heavy grit (16 to 36)  disc made of some stif fibre
material which is backed by a big rubber disk.  This will go through any rust
and down to shiney metal in short order.  Rent one if you can't borrow or buy.
If you get prepared you can grind out all the rust on the whole car in a few
hours.  The grinder is also invaluable for finishing fibreglass and bondo
repairs.  The coarse discs will get the bulk of the material into a level plane.
Finish sanding can be accomplished with a &quot;soft pad&quot; which is a foam backed pad
on which sandpaper is glued using disk adhesive.  

Once I get all the rust I can with grinder..hammer and chisel, etc....I paint
everything with rust reformer...Benzoic acid emulsion sold by  various
firms...The one I'm using these days is a NAPA product.  This stuff turns rust
into a black stable compound and acts as a primer coat for the rusted areas.  I
go over my cars once or twice a year and treat rusty spots with this stuff to
keep it from advancing till I can get around to a complet repaint.

I've tried Zinc Chromate primer next in heavy coats over floors and such.  

Larger rusted out areas are covered with fibreglass cloth and polyester resin in
three or four coats, and a final skim coat of bondo to fill the texture and make
a smooth finish.  

Finish with paint of your choice...John Jensen in Annapolis,
