Who knows;
		Below the heater controls on Ramona's dash, there is a red plastic round
button-esque light that, when depressed, goes lit red. There is a &quot;B&quot; in the
center etched in white.
		Been there forever, and I've never known its use. We've always used it as
the miscellaneous James Bond button; fire bombs, rear-end oil spray (like
'Mona needs a button pushed to do that ;), and, her favorite, the cloaking
device initiator.
		Stranger, it always used to illuminate when pushed, even with no key on, but
since we've been tinkering around the past few months in our (successful)
effort to revive our hero-ess, the light no longer lights...so, that's what
really got me thinking about throwing out this post to you all.
		Since we are not planning any future trips through Utah, the cloaking device
and lack thereof, is not a necessity, but we're very curious, and figure you
can help.
Many Thanks
Rachel &amp; Ramona
