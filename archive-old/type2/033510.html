oh. also.

be sure you clean up the flanges on the muffler, as well as the heater
boxes, with a good wire wheel, or file, or what have you.  the muffler
flanges had a few...imperfections... that did not allow the gasket to seal
properly.  and the heaterbox flanges tend to havesimilar problems of their
own by this time.  both set of flanges needd to be fiarly straight and
smooth.

later...davi

&gt; Any help or suggestions are appreciated.
