Michael.

There is no need to enlarge the coverplate hole or to remove the ignition 
distributor.

I simply used a 50mm long spacer mast, with male and female M10x1.0mm screw 
threads, in conjunction with one or more banjo fittings, such as those which 
are used with BMW brake master cylinders or the oil-pressure switches of 
water-cooled VW and Audi car engines.

Regards.

&gt;
&gt;I just put one of these in my 78- It's the VDO with a terminal for the
&gt;idiot light and a terminal for the sender.  It grounds to the case.
&gt;Instead if t's and elbows  (it's tight with the tin and distributor) ,
&gt;get a dremyl rotary tool &amp; a couple of grinding bits (#911, 932, or
&gt;8193).
&gt;The stock hole must be enlarged by removing the distributor (mark its
&gt;position and stuff a rag in the hole). and grinding around the edge of
&gt;the tin until you can screw in the sender.  Use a screwdriver as
&gt;leverage between the terminals to tighten the sender.  I used a bit of
&gt;gasket sealer on the threads. A bead of silicone can be placed around
&gt;the sending unit to seal air leakage.  Wear rubber/mylar gloves as you
&gt;have to use a finger to work in the sealer.

&gt; &gt; and sending unit for my bus (VDO.)  i want to get the sending unit with 
&gt;the
&gt; &gt; terminal for the idiot light AND the gauge.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; so, simply speaking....if the picture of the gauge has 2 pointy things 
&gt;on
&gt; &gt; one end, and opposite is the end that fits into the engine....this is a
&gt; &gt; dual gauge for the purpose i am seeking?!
