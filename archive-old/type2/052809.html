Subject: Aircooled Buy &amp; Sell

Before I get any more mail about it, the &quot;BuySell&quot; link at www.type2_dot_com
has been disabled temporarily, and I've asked Yvan to disable the site
itself (BuySell lives on a server over which we have no control).

There has been a report, which seemed credible, that there may be a person
selling parts/busses/restoration services through the BuySell page, using
multiple addresses, who is engaged in fraud on rather a large scale. We
don't intend to try to police every transaction that occurs through BuySell
(caveat emptor always) but given these particular circumstances, if you are
buying something through BuySell I think you should sit on your hands for a
day or two and don't send any money to anybody.

We will try to get to the bottom of it ASAP but in the meanwhile please
just sit on your wallet.
