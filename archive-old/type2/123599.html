Subject: RE: [T2] Re: silicon caulk vs OEM oil cooler foam seal

&gt;&gt;&quot;one question, why not replace with one of the 'new super' foams?&quot;

&gt;When I installed the doghouse into my '70 1600SP, I used a valve cover
gasket and contact cement to seal my oil cooler tin.  Works like a charm.
The cork can withstand oil as well as the extreme temps, just as if it were
sandwiched between a valve cover and a cylinder head.


fabulosio! i was told today by the flaps dewd that at his shop they use
one-sided sticky foam for doors and windows. i was going to do that with a
caulk trim. your timing is stupendous, eron. something to sleep on. heavy
thanks to all the guys who pitched in on this thread.   - steve
