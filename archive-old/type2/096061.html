&gt; &gt;If you can leg press 500
&gt; &gt;pounds, you can probably live without it, but if not, it can be important.
&gt; 
&gt; Seriously, have you guys experienced dead-booster buses as being hard to brake?

I don't know about that but replying to a 5 line message with each line
800 characters long is getting old, either turn on your word wrap or get
decent software! 

now for what it's worth, I have hand controls on my bus and the once or
twice that the booster has failed I can vouch for the &quot;real push&quot; to get
that bugger stopped
