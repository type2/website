Subject: Re: Electrical FIRE! and Nellie

My  electrical guru says

(As I am an electrical idiot - more on Nellie later)

Put in a 6V battery.  Trying to charge the 8V er with an system designed to
put out 6V, causes extra heat because the battery wont  accept the
electricity, because it has more electricity in the battery than is flowing
towards it, so the heat builds up and Voila!!   zap and burn em.


BTW,  Nellie is still, sadly in the garage. 65 camper.  The rebuildt master
cylinder is in, brakes bled, windsheilds resealed with the ledges cleaned off
and repainted, but I feel like having wipers.  The wiper motor that came with
it 1) worked, but noisily  2) the pivots were both broken, and 3) is 6V,
where the bus is 12V.

I put the motor on another frame, which pivots must be heated up and cooled
to free them, then oiled before installation.   Hopefully, this will cut done
on the noise.  

Also, I will get a voltage drop resistor.

Okay for that - also, a brief electrical fire happed in the front wires, and
one of the taillights no longer lights.  Blinkers and brakes light ok, no
running light.  Afterthe fire, it's all shot to heck.
As it has inexplicibly warmed up to a balmy 55 or so, from the freezing days
of a week ago, I should be out there now, but am not.  Tommorrow, I will take
a deep breath, lots of sandpaper and new push on terminals, and dive deep
into the wiring.    A true baptism. (hopefully not of fire)  And though I
seem to have no wiring diagram for a 65, I do have another 65 to compare
with.
