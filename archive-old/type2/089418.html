Cam installed without backlash (.000&quot;-.005&quot; )
will contaminate the oil with metal flakes.
The gear is very soft, and will disintegrate.

&gt;guess what. cam noises. i have enormous certainty the cam
&gt;rivits were tight tight. before i go in an do surgery again, do folks on
&gt;the list have any comments as to whether there are other things to consider
&gt;besides the cam. it sounds like bong drums in there, and gets louder and
&gt;more consistent as the engine warms.     - steve
