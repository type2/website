&gt; It occurs to me that it ought to be possible to fit one of those Coleman

&gt; Is this safe ?  Is it a good idea ?  Has anyone tried it ?  

My answers would be more: mostly, a qualified yes, and yes :-)  I have
used a gasoline fired stove by times and a propane fired unit as well. For
cooking, stoves (any fuel) are reasonably safe as long as you have good
ventilation, but there are dangers as well.  

&gt; Yes, I know this subject is covered in the archives, but I'm confused by
&gt; some transatlantic language problems...specifically when the term 'Gas' is
&gt; used does it mean 'Petrol (UK)/Gasoline (US)' or Butane perhaps, or Propane
&gt; or something else like LPG or Methane or whatever...

Locally, here in the colonies, gas can either be a contraction of gasoline
(petrol) or it can be a fuel that comes in gaseous form (Natural gas,
propane, butane, LPG, etc.). In this, as in so much else, we appear to be
two countries separated by a common tongue :-)

Westfalia installed only LPG-fueled stoves in their campers, there and
here.  Aftermarket, there are all manner of fuels used.  Used as directed
(stable position, lots of fresh air, fire extinguiher handy) any
well-maintained stove is safe enough.  The one big word of warning is that
combustion should never take place in an enclosed area! No matter what the
fuel, if you are not circulating a fresh oxygen supply, then you will
develop carbon monoxide and it will kill you.  The general reply of &quot;yeah,
but whose bus is that tight?&quot; is one that I hope we never have to answer.
