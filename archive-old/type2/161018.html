I have not been at all happy with the unit I bought on sale at Sears a few years ago.  In some modes, it almost never wants to stabilize.  Just jumps around like crazy.  I don't know when it started doing that but it's not worth fixing.  Thanks for the advice about the Actron.  Might try one of those.  For me to spend $250 for a Fluke would be a, well..    Cheers....KR

&gt; You can get a $250+ Fluke on the auction site by the bay for about
&gt; $50-$75 bucks, send it to Fluke for service and
&gt; insure good data for life. Here's one, 190074796178.

I have a 450$ fluke meter and a 1500$  fluke scopemeter and i have
an actron 7676 in the bus and use it for all things automotive and it has
always worked just fine.

page.
