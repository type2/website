&gt; I've got one. I use it in the garage to warm it up.

Hello Chris and guys    I had a small heater like that cause a fire under a 
bus one time in a small garage . The bus unknown to me had a small gas leak 
behind the engine.It was just like what happened to Terry with the drop lite. 
Thank goodness I had a large fire bottle sitting right there, didn't hurt the bus 
except for some  soot.  So be careful with anything that has an open flame. 
Later and have fun  Mark Dearing
