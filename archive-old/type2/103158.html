Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Sad, sad day for Lurch

Chris,

This is a t1 engine ...from reading closely...!!!!

My opinion....even a *bad* oil pump filter setup is better than
none at all.

I'll probably get seriously flamed for this , but have always had good 
luck with the standard aftermarket filter pump setup.....course I always
do it like the guys in &quot;hot to hot rod your vw's &quot; say to make sure it is 
good.

I would rather blow a filter(and have on a cold morning) than circulate 
garbage in my oil.

Chris, how can the crank be ok if the bearings were scored??
garbage in the oil passages on initial startup and breakin?

If you would'nt eat supper out of the inside of any part of your engine
when assemling, then it is *not* clean enough.

Carbon on the pistons...standard
black plugs with a 009....hmmmmm...too cold a range...obviously something 
*not right on the heat side if the pistons and cylinders were &quot;bluish&quot; and 
scored.

Chris, 28 degrees should be fine for the 009....too lean...&lt;sigh&gt; what bs.
How far do you drive it on a daily basis and in what kind of traffic/road?

Engine tin and all seals exact?
Are you *really* sure you want to deal again with the guy who rebuilt this 
last?????
How many miles?

Cheers, dave

&gt; Kind listfolk,

&gt; I last posted about a month ago, to wit:

&gt; &lt;SNIP&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Lurch died this morning.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;It was 9 degrees out and I was going to run an errand.  Lurch started OK,
&gt; but after about five seconds, it quit suddenly. 
&gt; &gt;After that, it would just barely crank.  Hmmm....

&gt; I had Lurch towed to the guy who rebuilt the engine last.   After about two
&gt; weeks (yesterday), I went out to look at things.
&gt; 
&gt; #1 main bearing had seized.
&gt; All the cylinders/jugs showed heat damage (scored cylinders/piston skirts and
&gt; bluish discoloration of the jugs).
&gt; The case, crank, cam (one-piece), and lifters were all OK.
&gt; The bearings were scored.
&gt; 
&gt; I did a tune-up and oil change four times since the rebuild.
&gt; I had filings in the oil, but never excessively (I failed to test them for
&gt; ferrousness).
&gt; The spark plugs were always black!   There was still carbon on the pistons,
&gt; but it was flaking off.
&gt; I did switch carbs from a 31 PICT 3 to a 34 PICT 4 (?) about a thousand miles
&gt; before this calamity.
&gt; The 009 distributor was always set at 28 degrees at 3000 RPM (about 7.5 at
&gt; idle).
&gt; 
&gt; The rebuilder suggested that I was either too lean are too retarded (the
&gt; timing).   He suggested timing it to 30 degrees or more.
&gt; 
&gt; I monitor this thing to the nines.   RPM, oil press., oil temp., head temp.,
&gt; amps and volts, and never did any of these parameters go to extremes.
&gt; I realize that absolute values aren't much due to inaccuracy, but relative
&gt; values have been peachy through several engines.
