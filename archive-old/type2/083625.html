&gt; I'll never forget a large truck in Italy that had such a high power
&gt; transmitter on his radio (would it still be a CB in Italy?) that he broke

&gt; Sounded like an Italian speaking devil - all deep and rumbling. I did not

It can be done with the high power and uncontrolled spurious emissions of
the typical CB amplifier.  If the product is illegal in the first place,
why put any effort into engineering proper spur suppresion into it?
