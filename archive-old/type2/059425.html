Subject: Fan....

All,

In the engine bay of my 1978 2-litre camper there is a fan above the
engine that has two outlets, it appears that they each go to one of the
heat exchangers...is this a booster fan??? I can't find any mention of
it in the handbook, but it it is there in all the pictures...and how
does it work, is there a seperate switch, or a thermo switch..

Any help would be gratefully accepted....

TIA
