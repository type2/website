Subject: Re: '79 Engine in an '81

&gt;Here's the scoop on switching tin, etc on '79 vs '81. The heads and
&gt;heater boxes are exactly the same, so there should be little problem in
&gt;changing tin, heat, exhaust, etc.

This is incorrect.  Check the parts lists for verification.  The '79 
heat exchangers are a one-year-only part.  This is because the Bus used 
an electric heat blower fan in the engine compartment that blew fresh 
air into the heat exchangers from above.  The Bus also used a heater box 
connection to the fan housing to get some air flow that way.  The 
Vanagon used neither of these methods.  There is no connection to the 
heater boxes from the fan housing on a Vanagon (hence the different fan 
housing) and the Vanagon uses a blower mounted to the alternator to 
provide all the fresh air to the heat exchangers, hence the different 
exchangers and heat ducting.

The heads are the same, which is why the '79 heater boxes are a one year 
part.  The earlier Bus heads used an oval shaped exhaust port while the 
so-called Vanagon heads ('79-'83) used a square shaped exhaust port.
