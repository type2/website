Subject: Re: [T2] powdercoating rims

There is a grey zinc enriched powder primer that is prbably the best thing 
to use under the white topcoat. When you have the wheels blasted make sure 
they use sand, aluminum oxide or the newer synthetic sand. Do not blast them 
with glass beads. We always tell the blasters 100 oercent white metal and I 
believe the proper profile is 2-3. The other important thing to do is try to 
grind off any sharp corners. This applies to liquid or powder. It tends to 
create and thin spot there and just ends up rusting.

There are several ways to get around the Faraday cage problem. The two 
biggest being run a fan tip on the gun and spray the wheel hot. Most places 
try to spray everything at room temp and it can make the faraday cage 
problems really bad. The bus wheels tend to be pretty bad because of the way 
that the rims are made. When I finished mine I even went over the crevice on 
them with a little bit of motor oil to try and seal it as well as possible.

Make sure they use a polyester based powder. An epoxy based powder will fade 
in the sun. If you have any other questions just let me know. I've been 
spraying the stuff for about 10 years now.
