&gt;The 018 subs to the 020. Either one will work. Both are 7 pin.
&gt;You are thinking of 75/early 76. This was the 016 AFM. It had 6 pins.
&gt;79 Calif is 022. It has 7 pins but also has a O2 sensor.

If anyone is interested....I find very good used ones here in Fresno, Cal. in the $35-$40 price range. 016's are tough to find. 022's a little easier. 018-020 common.
