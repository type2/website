Subject: RE: [T2] Brazilian VW Bus

Todd,

I believe you can register it as a kit car in most states. I am not sure of
the specifics but it may be similar to the Experimental Aircraft licensing
for private planes. Many X-Aircraft are retired and restored military planes
that don't meet government regs, much like cars. If someone can purchase a
MIG-15 and fly it over my home every Sunday morning, I am sure there is a
way to get a Brazilian bus here too, without resulting to semi-legal
shenanigans.

My wife INSISTS that we buy a brand new Brazilian Volkswagen Bus. I told her
I didn't think it was possible because they don't meet US safety and crash
test ratings. Is there ANY to buy one and bring it over to the states? Even
if it isn't legal to drive on the street, can I still bring one over? (and
then maybe work something out in one of the states with more LAX
registration laws?


Thanks!
