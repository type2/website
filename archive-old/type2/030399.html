X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

First, the admin for the web page is Ken Hooper.  Suggestions for
improving it should go directly to him.

Second, tho I like the idea of (a) an indexed link page or (b) a
mechanical FAQ on the web site or both, we already have them to an extent.  
The problem is that maintaining a list of links is a very time consuming
task.  I know, I do it for work, and we conduct sweeps of that list every
month and average a dozen changes in 240 links *every* month!  and those
are professional sites, presented by state govenments and universities!
