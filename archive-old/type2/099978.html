&lt;&lt; Obviously, it is a labor problem and a &quot;who&quot; problem.  The old guys
actually &quot;look&quot; at what they are doing and the $8.00 laborers could care 
less cause they don't feel good, or are stoned, or are semi-drunk....they 
are just there to do a &quot;job&quot; instead of really &quot;looking&quot; at what they are 
doing.  *They* aren't going to be out in the middle of the desert when the
alternator bearing die, so they don't really care. &gt;&gt;

Before casting stones, try and spread the blame out a little more...
If &quot;we&quot; (that's me, too) shop by price alone then the company with
the lowest price gets the biggest market share and drives out the
others. Most corporations consider &quot;labor&quot; just another item to be
purchased at the lowest cost; i.e. the most &quot;production&quot; per man-
hour often regardless of quality. New VW's aren't just built by
highly skilled German craftsmen, either...But then again, neither
are Mercedes-Benz vehicles...;-(
