Subject: Maryland Metrics - useful link

Volks,

(I'm bored, can you tell? :-)

Just surfing a bit and again I came across the Maryland Metrics home page,
which had the torque specs I was looking for.  I thught I ought to post
their URL here, as they have a web page that is an *incredible* source of
data on all sorts of metric fasteners.  The only real drawback to the page
is that they are strictly a wholesale outfit :-(  If you want 100, 1,000,
or 10,000... they have you covered!  For 1-10, tho, you're out of luck :-(

Their home page is:
http://mdmetric_dot_com/
As an example, from our recent discussion on metric stainless fasteners,
see their page of nuts at:
http://mdmetric_dot_com/fastindx/chapterd.htm
Not only steel and stainless steel, but aluminum and nylon!  Even
WHITWORTH thread!!!!

Within the stainless section, they have what are probably the ideal nuts
for exhaust work at $22.10/hundred for plain or $77.90/hundred for
self-locking!  Heaven knows what I would do with the other 92 nuts after I
was done tho :-)  See:
http://mdmetric_dot_com/fastindx/ud56_62.pdf

Then you can look up the proper tightening torque at:

What an amazing site! I have no connection to them, but wish I did!

Lastly, I am gonna buy their metric 150mm +/-.01mm electronic caliper
micrometer for $32.  Just too good a deal to pass.

                           Steve Dolan
