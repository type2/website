Subject: Re: [T2] Oil substance leaking at rapid rate......

Troy, put a plastic bag under the Bus and let some of this leak drip onto
it. Pull the bag out after it's got some oil on it. Then pull your dipstick
and smell the oils on the dipstick and on the bag, one oil at a time.

If what's on the bag smells like what's on the dipstick, you've probably got
a blown main seal on the engine. If they smell different (and if the oil on
the bag is a lot thicker than the oil on the dipstick), you've probably got
a blown transmission seal. (Since you're not seeing oil levels change in the
engine, my money's on the transmission seal.) And you need to pull the
engine to fix either one. Level of difficulty depends on how good you are at
pulling engines and whether it's a Type 1 or a Type 4 engine--the seals
themselves are not hard to change. Tradeoffs: Type 4 engine is heavier and
takes more muscle to maneuver, but the Type 1 flywheel bolt (gland nut) is
harder to get on and off.
