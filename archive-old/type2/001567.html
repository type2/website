I'm set to go look at a couple of basket case buses soon, and think I'll
have the opportunity to salvage some sheet metal for my 71 Westy.  Any words
of advice on doing that in the field, maybe without electricity available?
Probable parts include the rocker panel, rear corners (I hope), wheel wells,
etc.

I'm no body guy, keep it simple.
