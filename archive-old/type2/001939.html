Bus wouldn't turn over, but I could push start it...but I had to wiggle the
key in just the right spot....tried to tighten solenoid connection...the
bolt broke off with part of the solenoid. I replaced solenoid today and new
battery cable. But to my suprise it still didn't turn over. I know the
starter is functioning. Could I have put the starter in wrong?..must I line
up the gear? Is it really important which clips those little red wires
attach to the solenoid (fuel injection). Could a fault in the ignition
switch itself cause the solenoid to burn out?...and finally how important is
it that the ground strap from the transmission  be grounded properly and
would it relate to this problem
Thanks!

P.S. Muir taught me to understand that working on a vw would teach me
valuable lessons...about myself..
