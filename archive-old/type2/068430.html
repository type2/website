Subject: Magic Bus (not VW related, sorry) (fwd)

Ok. I hope not to offend and I do not want to be rude. But,
Did anyone read the recent message from our list adm. Ken reminding
people this is a VOLKSWAGEN list? Ken puts in lots of time and
his own money for this list and frankly, my bus would be
sitting in the garage immobile if were not for this list.

When we go to the new server with a message limit this is
exactly the kind of NOT EVEN CAR related stuff that will
be taking up space when some poor guy is stuck at home
and can't get to work and needs some advice to get his 
bus going again. If it were I that was stuck and I saw this 
message, I would not be happy.

Now please do not get me wrong. I think that there is
a great community feeling about this list  but if 
some of you desire to incorperate freind making
maybe there should be some other list that you can
start and maintain and pay for. In the meantime,
let's all please adhere to our adm. request and
keep this VW maintanence related.

  They play Philly on Sunday and some more of the
East, I don't know what else.  Sort of neat seeing 40 year olds taking
their kids to see them BTW, that is staying power as &quot;the worlds
greatest rock and roll band.&quot;
