&gt; WOAA!!! What was that rusty tube a picture of? Was that the tube

That's not part of the frame, that's the heater duct from the back of 
the Bus that
runs under the floorboards.  It was originally wrapped with insulation 
to help
keep the heat in, but the insulation tends to hold water and promote 
rust.

Which would explain why it's rusted so bad while everything else looks 
nice.
