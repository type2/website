Subject: Re: [T2] Deceleration Valve testing

on 9/29/03 14:50, Ryan O'Rear related:

&gt; I was attempting to test my deceleration valve by following the Bentley
&gt; manual. It says to pull the hose  from  to the AFM side of the connection .
&gt; Then start the engine. So I pulled the hose from the 'S' side and attempted to
&gt; start the van. The engine would die out after a second

the instructions should say remove and PLUG. make sure any hoses you remove
are plugged at either end, or the hole they leave is plugged. you are trying
to take the decel valve out of the intake air circuit, so you need to plug
any hoses you remove. you might need some small corks for this.
