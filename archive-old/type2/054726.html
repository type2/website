 I worked a VW shop for a few years, and we would always pull the
 alternator with the engine in the bus.
 
 Yes , that's on a 1600.  We only worked on upright engines, no pancakes
 at all.
 
 The only time we had to pull the engine is if the fan nut wouldn't break
 loose.  
 
 Maybe we were doing it wrong, but it always worked, and I've done it on
 my own bus.  You just have to get  up in the engine compartment with your
 engine.  
 
 Just a thought,

I have no doubt that you can do it if you say you not only can but have done 
so.  But I am 59 and not double jointed and I cannot imagine any position I 
could get into that would allow me to loosen or retorque the fan nut with the 
engine in my 71 bus.  It is much easier for me to pull the engine.  Might 
have something to do with advancing age too, but that is not a VW topic so 
don't remark on it.
