I'll have to put the flame suit on for this one. IMHO, $5,800.00 may not be 
too far out of line for this one. I've seen bays going for more than this 
that don't &quot;sound&quot; as good as what you describe. Garaged and the interior is 
in mint condition? A fairly rare find. How far did you drive it? The brakes 
may have been slightly rusty if it's been sitting a while. Mine do this when 
mine has been sitting for a couple weeks or more, but it goes away after a 
while. Or the rotor(s) may have a high spot. I'd take it to a mechanic and 
have the whole thing checked out. More often than not, low miles and little 
use are harder on a vehicle than high miles and frequent use. Sure, you can 
buy a rusted out beater for $1,000.00 or less, but is that what you really 
want? And if you buy the beater for $1,000.00 and plan to restore it, I 
guarantee you'll spend far more than $5,800.00 in parts and TIME. And, sorry 
Mark, but a one year warranty from a private seller is unheard of. Even a 
used car lot would MAYBE go 90 days on a vehicle this old. Use the brakes and 
the heat ( and whatever else a mechanical inspection turns up ) as a 
bargaining chip,and try to get the seller down some, maybe to $5,000.00. 
Final question- How many of you out there would sell a garaged Westy with a 
complete, mint condition interior for less than 5K? Yeah, I thought so.    
Good Luck,  Jeff   ( Who has been restoring a rusted out Westy for three long 
years!)
