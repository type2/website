Hi John,

	From what I have pieced together, the .009 was originally favored as
a &quot;performance upgrade&quot; by the racing crowd.  Since most of these guys were
building engines that were far from stock, the stock dizzy wasn't
necessarily the perfect choice.  My research indicates that for instance the
vacuum signal from many large Webers is far from ideal for the stock dizzy.

	For streetability and extended engine life on a stock or near stock
engine, the vac advance is the way to go.  
This is another classic case where the VW  engineers would have rather saved
the money and kept things simple if it worked as well or better for the
engine they designed.  
	It seems nowadays that the .009 is used whenever people need a cheap
distributor that will get their engine to run well enough to get them from
point A to point B.  The fact that the .009 has no vacuum port attachments
(relies on mechanical advance only) makes it a simple and straightforward
install.   In my opinion this is the reason for being the choice for so many
shadetree mechanics over the years.  The .009 will get most aircooled
VWengines to run somewhat, even the Type IV's,
	The availability of cheap parts is also another reason that they
still enjoy popularity.  You would probably be hard pressed to find a FLAPS
without a cap, points and condenser for the .009 in any location.  Trying to
find these parts for a stock vacuum dizzy can be a much more trying, and
often more expensive process.

							Of course I could be
wrong...

Someone (Steve Dolan??) stated earlier that they checked 10 early bays at EB
and ALL had .009 dizzys. I have owned 3 different buses with T1 engines, and
ALL of these had .009.  Yet the general consensus is that these are BAD.  SO
the big question then is &quot;If the .009 is obviously bad, then why the hell
does nearly everyone with a T1 engine in an early bay have this
set-up?!?!?!&quot;  It must be more than cost and availability.  In the service
records of my 71 Westy (I have all records since new, thank JAH God or
whomever for Previous Owners who actually took great care of the bus!!) I
have a receipt where the PO had a reputable shop in Virginia (I think it was
VA) remove the old dizzy and install the .009 set-up. SO WHY HAVE SO MANY
DONE THIS IF IT IS UN-ARGUABLY BAD????
