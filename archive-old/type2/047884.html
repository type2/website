remove the v belt.  run the engine for a short time. if the sound is gone
then you know it was in the Alternator, fan, or fan housing.........

&gt;     I am posting to both lists because my bus falls into both categories.
I
&gt; have a 70 with a 1600cc dual port engine. This morning when I cranked him
&gt; up, there was a funny, almost 'rubbing' sound. (It sounds very much like
the
&gt; sound my 68 made when its generator died.)
&gt;     I have an alternator that was out in, brand-new, 2 years ago this
month.
&gt; The sound is definitely coming from the engine compartment, and you can
hear
&gt; it and out of gear, but it is very faint. In fact, unless you drove him
&gt; everyday like I do, you would probably not even notice the sound.
&gt;     I know it is a longshot to get any advice on a sound that none of you
&gt; can hear, but I thought I would give it a try anyway.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for the time,
