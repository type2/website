Subject: Damn!  Rounded over CV Joint Bolt!!!!

Hi all:

Removing CV bolts today, got over-confident and rounded out one of the
Allen-head bolts.  Thank goodness it was on the trans side.  Since I'm going
to remove the trans anyway I can just drill out the head of the bolt and
deal with the stub later.  But, I'd kind of like to see if I *can* get the
bolt out properly.

I've seen suggestions to use vice-grips.  Frankly, I've never had much
success with the vice-grip method and, given how tight these bolts are
seated, I'm not too optimistic about that method.

I've seen suggestions to use a 1/4&quot; Allen-head socket and pound it into the
rounded-over head of the bolt.  Since I'm going to re-use the CV joints, and
not disassemble them upon removal, I'm a little leery of the &quot;pound it in&quot;
method.

Has anybody tried carefully cutting a &quot;slot&quot; in the head, like the slot in a
screw head, and removing the bolt with an appropriate &quot;screwdriver?&quot;  (I
have screwdriver-head sockets, so I can get good leverage on the bolt that
way.)  Just figure it's a logical thing to try, but maybe somebody else had
tried it, and can comment on how it works?

TIA.
