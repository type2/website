Subject: [T2] 911 engine install on a 74 bus.

&gt; I am thinking of installing this 2.4 911 engine and 901 tranny I have into
my
&gt; bus, but I am still just kind of pipe dreaming about it.
&gt;
&gt; I know I am going to have to install the oiltank and figure out a CV joint
&gt; conversion, mod the tin,etc, but does anyone have any info on a 911 engine
&gt; swap into a late model bay? There is a dead link on www.type2_dot_com

Do it. Just do it....( the little Devil on your other shoulder :)
When you price the Raby stuff, it becomes emminently easier :)
Anyone else want one ?
I have a dozen, and all the tricks.
( .....yes, this is rocket science:)
