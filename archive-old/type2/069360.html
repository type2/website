I would like to thank the following for their input regarding the '87
Jetta GLI. We are getting it fixed and will keep it as long as possible. I
will post a update after we pick it up. Thanks again,

Is anyone planning on attending the Volunteer Bug Jam '96 on 8/3 &amp; 4. It
will be held at Chilhowee Park, Knoxville, TN. My girlfriend and I will be
there enjoying the scene and also looking for parts for my '72 camper. I
need a louver (jalouse) window, and outside mirrors (drivers &amp;
passengers), and the handle/lock for the sliding door. If anyone
plans to attend and/or have some of these parts for sell, please let me 
know. I am not affiliated with this show, I am just passing on info. from
a flier. For more info regarding this show call (423) 579-5272.

Thanks,
