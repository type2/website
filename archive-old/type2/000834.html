Subject: Starter removal for a 77 bus
Date: Wed, 26 Jul 2000 16:53:04 -0700

Greetings,

I am looking for a bit of advise for the removal of a starter on my 77 bus.
I only have one bolt left to remove, it is the top bolt and I cant seem to
locate it. Chilton's states &quot; have a helper hold the nut on the top bolt
with a wrench in the engine compartment while you remove the bolt from
underneath the vehicle.&quot; I cant seem to find the nut in the engine
compartment, and the bolt that I feel on the starter feels round....

Any helpful hints on how to get this top bolt and nut off would be grand.
