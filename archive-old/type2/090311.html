Subject: Re: [T2] no spark continued

&gt; i took the advice to put a test light on the sid of the coil that runs to
&gt; the distributor and turning over the engine.  The light never went off like
&gt; it was supposed to.  I didn't turn the engine over by hand i had a friend
&gt; turn the key.  so does this mean the points are bad?  thanks

1) points not closing.
   misadjustment?
   broken dizzy? is the rotor turning?
2) no ground for the points. This brings us back to the braided wire
again. check the continuity from the plate inside the dizzy to the engine
case/ground.
