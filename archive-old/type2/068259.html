&gt;&gt;Dropped the engine to get to the clutch/pressure plate problem today.
&gt;&gt;Sure enough, the ends of the teeth on the diaphragm-type pressure
&gt;&gt;plate were real worn, with a couple of them actually broken off.

&gt;I bet your old one [he's referring to the clutch plate - Tom] is good for
another 5 years.  My current clutch disc has
&gt;9 years and over 50,000 miles on it, and it *still* doesn't show any signs
&gt;of wear other than a slight glaze which is normal.

&gt;p.s.  As far as I'm concerned, clutch discs aren't subject to entropy
&gt;unless they are abused.

I think that there may be something particularly problematic with '71
busses and their clutches. My previous bus had terrible problems:
1.   The clutches wore out fast.
2.   The clutch pedal never felt right. Normally, the pedal has a little
free travel (1/2&quot; or so) before showing any real resistance; once you
push beyond the resistance, the pedal pushes fairly easily to the floor.
However on my '71 the pedal started out with a little resistence, which
grew until the pedal was all the way to the floor.
3.   It was impossible to adjust the clutch cable with any confidence,
because of problem #2. No matter what I did, including adjusting the
slack in the guide tube by the transmission, there was no way to get
that 1/2&quot; of free-travel in the clutch pedal, because there was no point
in the movement of the pedal where I felt a definite change in
resistence.
4.   Everytime I changed the clutch, the pressure plate was damaged. The
teeth at the ends of the spring fingers in the center of the plate were
grooved, and the some of the fingers did not spring all the way back up
when the plate was removed from the flywheel.

As a result of these problems, I was replacing the pressure plate,
clutch plate, and throw-out bearing about every ten months. No one on
the net or otherwise was ever able to offer any  advice that led me to a
solution.

I sold that '71 bus a couple years ago and got a '71 Westfalia pop-top.
The clutch pedal still doesn't feel the way I think it should, but I
don't think I'm having the same problems with wear.

One possibility that occured to me is that my old bus might have had its
transmission bell housing shaved down to accept a non-stock engine. This
might have changed the geometry between the pressure plate and the
throw-out bearing, bringing them so close together that they were always
in contact. It's just a guess though.

I'd be very interested to hear if anyone else has had similar problems
with '71s.
