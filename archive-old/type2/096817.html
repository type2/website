Subject: 1969 camper canvas

--part1_fd.1db269df.2ab2d2bf_boundary

I'm restoring a 69 Westy camper with the cot pop up.  I have recently 
replaced the seals on the poptop and am amazed to see how much of the work by 
previous owners has been quarter-assed (half assed would be too kind).  I am 
ready to install and new canvas, but all the instructions I've gotten say to 
refer to the installation of the old canvas as you're taking it out and apply 
the same methods to the installation of the new one.  After seeing the 
condition of the old canvas, I hesitate to follow the same method of 
installation for fear that I'll just be doing it wrong.  A blow by blow guide 
would be more than helpful.  Pretend for a moment that when I got it there 
was no canvas at all.  I don't want to repeat the mistakes of the previous 
owners and I want this canvas to last.
I'm a new comer to this board and happy to be privy to the knowledge of more 
experienced owners.  Hope you can help me.
All the best,
Debbie
