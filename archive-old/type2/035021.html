Subject: Bus sightings in DC/Baltimore

I recently saw a brown pop top with &quot;JFF&quot; on the license plates in DC. And 
today I saw an orange Westy on 83 North coming out of Baltimore.  Any one on 
the list?  I tried to wave, but I wasn't driving my bus so I wasn't very 
noticable.

Anyway, I love to see those buses on the road.
