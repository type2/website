Subject: Re: How to Clean Pistons?


&gt;Next step is to clean of my pistons, cylinders, and heads that are coated
&gt;with carbon deposits.

&gt;What does everyone else do?

Go ahead and spend the $80, get new P&amp;Cs. You'll be glad you did. For the
heads you need a big bucket of carb cleaner, which is something like
nuclear waste but less benign. At your local auto parts store. Wear
neoprene gloves, it eats latex. It also eats carbon. 8)
