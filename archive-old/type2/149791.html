&gt; I've found that my dwell has changed from 44 to 52. What would this
&gt; change indicate - rubbing block wear?

Could be. Smaller gaps mean larger dwell.

&gt; A change in dwell changes timing, correct?

Yes.

&gt; Is there any formula to
&gt; translate change in dwell to change in timing. I was timed at 7.5 BTDC
&gt; previously. I'm wondering if I can determine what my timing's going to
&gt; be now that the dwell has changed.

An 8 degree change in the distributor might translate to a 4 degree change
at the crankshaft. Since the time the points close is 4 degrees ealier and 4
degrees later I would guess the timing has changed by 2 degrees.
