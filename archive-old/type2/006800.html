Hi all, this is a Friday kinda thing to do i suppose, but bear with me...

My boss thinks that all Volkswagen drivers use Macintosh computers, we have 
this ongoing PC vs. Mac debate. Personally, i am a PC guy. Anyway, he 
thinks that since I bought a bus I am going to convert to Macs. I thought 
it would be interesting to create a poll, if you care to cast your vote or 
just look at the results, go to:

gracias,
roger
