X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL - S

Thanks to everyone who has already replied!

First, excuse my lapses on two counts:
(1) Duh! Hydraulic *lifters*, not valves - I knew that!  As it turns out,
I've an exhaust leak on that side, where the heater box matches up.  Sadly,
only a week after getting my Westy running again, I must go overseas for a
month.  I'll take a look there when I've returned.
(2) Duh again!  Thanks to all who pointed out what I had apparently
forgotten - outside city water is just for the sink, not to fill the tank.
That's what the input on top is for!!

Now, to the electric.  Thanks to everyone who said I should check for bad
grounds.  As I write this, I haven't looked yet -  but will at my first
opportunity this afternoon.  I'll let everyone know what happens.

I am increasingly indebted to this wonderful community of fellow T-2'ers.  A
brief note to put things in perspective: the other day, my Westy was parked
on the street (a sign of movement and therefore mobility!) for the first
time in eons.  I left to the store, came home and discovered an Atlanta Gas
&amp; Light business card on the windshield.  On it was written &quot;Fellow Westy
Owner&quot; and an invitation to call!  I've had plenty of other cars sitting
around, including my wife's J**p - and I can think of no others that evoke
this sort of friendship.  Cheers to all of us!
