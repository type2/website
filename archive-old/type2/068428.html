&gt;An excellent discussion of where to wire your hot leads on your radio
&gt;

One note on WHY you should wire it to the buzzer or to a continuosly hot
wire and NOT to any wire which is hot when the key is turned to the &quot;on&quot;
position:

If you run your radio with the motor off but the key &quot;on&quot; you run the risk
of a burnt coil, as the coil will be charged when the key is in it's &quot;on&quot;
position.

Have fun and Good luck
