Hi David,

I say if you can get good hiop on a rebuild, so much
the better.  Especially if the bus has AC and will be
used for trips to the Eastern Shore.  When you get
stuck idling for an hour in bay bridge traffic, it's
nice to know you're oil pressure is OK, and not trying
to drop towards zero.

There are some trade secrets involved in getting good
hiop with a Type 4.  The only rebuilder I ever heard
of that would specify what you would get was Mark
Stevens.  I've heard of no one else who will specify
it; not Boston Bob, not Mofoco, and I'll bet not AVP. 
I feel this is a VW mystery waiting to be solved.

Rob

&gt; Here's a loaded question.  Why is HIOP such a big
&gt; deal?  Can anyone provide 
&gt; references to cases where low oil pressure at idle
&gt; caused premature engine 
&gt; failure?
