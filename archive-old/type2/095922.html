Subject: Re: [T2] wiring harness

I've seen alot of comments on this thread having to do with Bentley's and
other manuals that contain wiring schematics, and I felt I would add my own
(penny-saving) experience. While looking for a good color-coded wiring
diagram for my '78 Bus, I decided to visit the library to see if they had
anything. Well, it turns out they did! I found full two-page wiring
schematics that are black and white, but are labelled with the colors, fully
detailed and easy to read. Those diagrams have been indispensable ever
since, and they only cost $1.50!
For this reason, I would suggest to anyone that does not have the money for
a shop manual to visit their local library.

'Hope this helps someone!
