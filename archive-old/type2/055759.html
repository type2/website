Subject: RE: kill that westy thread

I'm about to take my newly acquired Westy tent into the back yard
and...1-) Water-proof it....2-) let small children and rodents
defecate in/on it...3-) dig a REALLY LARGE AND DEEP TRENCH around
it...4-) during a horrendous rain-storm (caused by el-nino, no doubt)
get myself castrated (doing my part to save the world, y'know)...5-)
burn my tent to the ground as it is a very large parrafin candle (my
castrated self being inside, of course)....
If I sound a little off the deep end, it's only because this thread is
WAY off the deep end!
Can we ALL PLEASE MOVE ON???:-)

Geez Jamie, let me buy you another Triple Mocha. I wont say another word
about it,,,,promise.
