That's a good idea, thanks Mark. 

In case anyone missed my previous post, I have a 78 camper van I'm looking
to rebuild/replace the engine in, and currently lack a nearby VW
specialist. I would much appreciate if anyone would happen to be in the
neighborhood they could stop by. I'll even buy lunch : ) I'm in Myrtle
Creek, OR, at I-5 milepost 108. If anyone is interested, drop me a line:
