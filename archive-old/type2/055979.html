Subject: VW Type2 Archive Search Tips... (All about Bob Hoover!)

Sorry that the search engine was down today, from about 11:00am to
3:00pm PDT.  I made a server mistake from remote and couldn't get home
from work any sooner to fix it &lt;grin&gt;.

There are a lot of really great messages in these archives, I encourage
everyone to play around with the search engine.

  ==== New Tip Page =====

http://www.i405_dot_com/vwarchive/about.asp  &lt;--- gives you two pages of
great tips about how to best use this engine!

This search engine is custom built, a VW type2 list deserves no less.
It has a simple yet effective philosophy, several small quick searches
are better than one monolithic complicated search!  However, there is
the education barrier.  I'm tracking what people are searching for, and
I'm seeing that some pointers are needed.  Again, Look at the
http://www.i405_dot_com/vwarchive/about.asp page for some tips, I promise it
is worth taking the time to read it.


  === What have people been searching for? ====

Hey, anytime you want -- you can see what other people are searching
for!  A little cryptic, but maybe you can figure it out and eavesdrop on
what other's are doing:

  === The Bob Hoover Series =====

The Exact Sender feature has been popular!   To use this, you have to do
a normal search, then find a specific message.  Once you are on a single
message, there is an option to show all messages with that exact sender
on the FROM: line.  However, the sender match is very specific... even a
single character cosmetic change to the e-mail address will constitute a
different sender.  For a given person, it takes a little effort:

1)  The three different list servers represented the e-mail addresses in
different ways.
2)  Sometimes your ISP, such as AOL, change their software and that
makes it different.
3)  Then people like Bob just re-install their software once in a while
and opt to change their name.  For example, Bob Hoover has changed the
&quot;visible&quot; portion of his e-mail address (at least) three times in the
last 18 months.  In the e-mail profession, this is sometimes called the
&quot;display name&quot;, and isn't the same as the e-mail address.  Although Bob
has kept the same &quot;address&quot; over time, slight variations in his display
name cause differences for an exact match.

To save time, I put together a shortcut page that has links to all of
Bob's messages.  There are five I have found so far.

  http://www.i405_dot_com/vwarchive/link00.asp  &lt;-- All of Hoover's
messages?

I will see if I can get a search that is more &quot;fuzzy&quot; that would let you
mach the technical e-mail address, putting in &quot;veeduber_at_aol_dot_com&quot; and
match ALL of these.  However, don't hold your breath, I'm more than
ready to take a long break from working on this search engine code
&lt;grin&gt;.  Could be weeks, could be months...
