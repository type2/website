Subject: Re: [T2] Stripped plug hole in the UK

Rent a car for the trip and have more than one old running car (especially if 
one is a VW bus) around so you can drive one while you work on the other. 
To do that spark plug the head has to come off and go to the shop, don't you 
think? It is a common occurrence with this car, surprising as it is, for the 
stupid spark plug to strip or get stuck. Aggravating! Put a coil in both plugs 
as long as it is off too.                             Laura :o)
