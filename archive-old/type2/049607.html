Subject: Re: [T2] changing out steering coupler

getting ready to replace the steering coupler in my 78.  wondering if
anyone had some helpful hints.

is it possible to do without removing either the steering column or gear
box??
is it easier to do it from the top or bottom??
any other parts you NEED to do the job?

TIA
Bob
