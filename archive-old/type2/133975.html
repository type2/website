Subject: re: oil temp sender install

&gt;Hi volks!
&gt;
&gt;I would like to install an oil temp sender on my 1700cc westy engine... 
&gt;Where and how should I do so?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!

Marck; 

I just ordered the VDO sender that replaces the oil drain plug for my
1800cc motor. Turns out my drain plug is M12 thread , and the sender is
M14. Apparently an M12 sender is not available, so the other place is to
drill a hole and permanently mount the sender there (which is what will
happen to my bus). But check your drain plug thread size, because that's
an easy place to install the sender.
