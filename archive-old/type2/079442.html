Subject: Re: [T2] turn signal indicator works only in one side



&gt;Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;My 71 Westy blinks the right side of turn indicator in the gauge even I 
&gt;make
&gt;left turn. So it blinks whenever I signal right AND left
&gt;Does anyone know what is happening?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!
&gt;William

Can't say I have an Idea but I seem to have a similar problem right now and 
look forward to suggestions on a possible fix.  &quot;Janis&quot; left turn sig. works 
fine but the right burns the fuse and causes the fuel gauge to slam to full? 
  and does not function otherwise?

Anyone have a suggestion?  I'm thinking either short on right, bad relay or 
switch.  Anybody?
