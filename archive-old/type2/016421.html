&gt;Hi,
&gt;    Before I start dissecting my engine I am interested in any comments on
&gt;the following problem.
&gt;
&gt;Just over a week ago my 2L engine(76 camper) started idling roughly,
&gt;backfiring and generally sounding really sick. A quick check showed that
&gt;No. 3 was not having much input into things, so I checked the tappets and
&gt;found that there was no gap on the intake valve. I adjusted it only to find
&gt;the same thing occurring several days later; adjusted it again only to find
&gt;the same problem this morning. I should point out that the locking nut is
&gt;not coming lose....it's staying as tight as I set it.
&gt;After resetting it everything runs fine for awhile but you can feel it
&gt;slowly losing it again.
&gt;   It has been suggested to me that the valve could have burnt but I'd
&gt;appreciate any comments before I start any major surgery as time to do so
&gt;is rather scarce at the present.
&gt;
Better to do something now than wait until it goes BANG!!!

Its possible the valve is stretching, the head will break off soon

Or secondly the valve seat is about to let go Both would need
attending to sooner rather than later.  But this is more common woth
exhaust valves

I just tore a spare 2 litre down the other day (it was in my bus when
I bought it not running).  It had dropped a seat on the number 3
exhaust valve.

Not a pretty Sight
