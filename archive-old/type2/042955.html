Subject: Bus Camping - Little Fort

Type 2 camping is the 'cat's meow'.

Last year, I shared a great camping experience at the Little Fort Virginia 
campout and beer blast.

At the campout, someone from (I believe) the Richmond VA, or VA Beach area 
showed me a map gazetteer of the Little Fort VA area.  It was great.

I recently bought a Virginia gazetteer, but is is much different from the 
one that I saw at the campout.

Could the person who had the gazetteer at Little Fort please contact me via 
P-Mail??  There REALLY is a difference between my new gazetteer and the 
others I saw.
