Just recently replaced the type 4 engine in my '72 bus with a '71 type I
engine.  However, there is a massive amount of space around the engine that
needs to be sealed off to ensure proper cooling.  I've played around with
different ideas, sheet metal, trying to find some fabricated tin, etc.  I
had a brain storm last night and thought I'd get your advice.  What do y'all
think of getting the rubber mat from the back seat area of the bus and
cutting it to fit around engine and seal off compartment?  Wouldn't need
much drilling and messing around with metal that I don't have or have money
for.  Just thought I'd see what y'all thought about this idea.

Michael
