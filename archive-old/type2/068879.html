Subject: Re: Bigger bed in 68-73 poptop???

Eric,

My old '71 came with a plywood bed with a foam mattress. It apparently was a
european only option from Westfalia. No reason why you couldn't fabricate
one. Hinge it on the front; put bumpers on the back.

Chris Venema (on the list) has my old bus now. Maybe he can give you some
dimensions and such. Chris? Are you there?

Good luck! Joe

&gt;Folks,
&gt;        I have a '72 Westy with the little tiny cot of a bed in the poptop.
&gt;This thing is painfully small and uncomfortable, basically it sucks.  I'd
&gt;love to have a bigger bed up there so when my girlfriend kicks me out of
&gt;the lower bed I have someplace decent to sleep (or vice-versa).  Or when I
&gt;go fishing with my buddy we don't have to fight for the lower bed!
&gt;        Has anyone ever put something bigger up there that will fold up or
&gt;be put away so as to allow one to still stand up when the top is popped?
&gt;Will the later style beds retrofit?  If yes, where could I get one?  The
&gt;cot appears to be easily removable so that probably isn't a problem but I'm
&gt;not in a hurry to drill a bunch of holes anywhere to mount the thing (a
&gt;couple clean ones maybe but I don't want to get crazy).  Any insight would
&gt;be great!
&gt;
