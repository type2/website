&gt; I am still a little confused about this...  It was my understanding
that
&gt; the octane number reflects the rate of combustion and is directly
&gt; related to the timing.  How does the presence of lead affect the
timing
&gt; between (say) 91 RON unleaded and 91 RON leaded?  If the octane is the
&gt; same, should this not mean the timing is the same?

IMO, you're correct.  91 octane is 91 octane, regardless of how it was
achieved.  The test engine doesn't know the difference.
