Subject: Dometic Fridge Amp Draw
Message-ID: &lt;OMNGILPMNHNGBAAA_at_theglobe_dot_com&gt;

Does anyone know how many amps a dometic draws? I'm looking to get a power converter and I need to know the amperage requirements.

And just in case any of you want to preach to me about how useless the Dometic is (I read the archives first), that's because most people don't keep them on all the time. Personally, I'm building a docking station for my bus...so not only will I have continous power to the dometic, but I'll also be able to access the ECU from my home PC to get that Hippie Time Machine effect. Heck, I may even network the bus and let you join in from my web site, volks_dot_net. ;)

Thanks! Joe
