Subject: VW-FIXING JUMPY .009 DIZZY

A relatively new Bosch .009 distributor is exhibiting JDS (jumpy dwell
syndrome) wherein the little whelp will flutter around from 50 to 40
degrees of dwell erratically.  It starts at the proper 50 degrees or so
but soon after being revved up, you can watch a dwell meter needle wiggle.
The timing light at idle also exhibits advancing from 7 1/2 BTDC in
lockstep with the dwell fluctuations.  Replacing this dizzy with another
.009 completely eliminates the problem.  I took the dizzy to an
auto-electric shop but they told me that based upon my description, it has
to be in the advance mechanism (the shaft seemed in place and the bearings
fine).  I then took it back to the place I bought it but they informed me
that they would not exchange an electrical device like this beyond five
days after purchase.  My protests that the problem wasn't in the
electronics (i.e., the condenser) but in something mechanical fell on deaf
ears.

It's only two months old with only a month of actual driving.  One option
would be to buy another $80 .009 dizzy (though from a parts store that
offers a 90 day warranty) but eighty bucks is eighty bucks.  The other
option would be to take the bastard apart and see if there is a screw or
spring or weight missing.

My question to y'all (or as they say in Texas for the plural you: &quot;all
y'all&quot;) is whether I should bother or is a .009's mechanical advance
set-up so funky that repair is not possible or parts are unavailable or
outrageously expensive?  If the former is true, is ther anything I should
look for?

Thanks,

Nick
