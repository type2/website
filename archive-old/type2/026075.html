Subject: Great Weekend at BNNTA

What a wonderful weekend at BNNTA.  The weather was perfect, during the day,
shorts and tee shirt weather, at night, sweatshirts and blankets.  Not a
cloud in the sky and a full moon at night!  The campground is beautiful and
the shower and restroom facilities are very nice.  The park people kept
everything clean daily.  Very cool place to gather a bunch of busses.

Good turnout of busses, the numbers were down some from past years, but
really a nice size for the campground.  There were about 85 from what I
could tell.  For long distance, Dave Easterwood drove out from the east
coast along with another east coast person.  There were some from Texas too.
Good number of splits along with every other model including 4 eurovans.
Got to meet a number of people who I had only known from the lists.  In our
group (the Buskatiers who had the largest group turn out by far) was a
number of first time bus meet campers and I know they enjoyed the weekend.
There were also a good number of families with small kids who seemed to be
having a good time as well.  As we were leaving Sunday afternoon a couple of
our group members were going down to the lake to rent jet skies.

I enjoyed cooking for our group, it's a nice way to bring everyone together.
And I want to thank those who pitched in to help by the groceries, I
couldn't afford to do this without your help.  We fixed chow for about 30
people at each meal and had breakfast burritos Saturday morning, fajitas and
red beans with rice Saturday evening and pancakes with pepper bacon Sunday
morning.  The pepper bacon went over really well!  I wanted to do some of
the cooking work so people could just enjoy the weekend and not have to feel
like all they did was cook and clean up every few hours.  It's also nice for
the new campers not to have to worry about food so much and have a good
camping experience.

Evenings around the fire were fun, we had a group fire that was tended very
nicely by Terry Wolfe (who by the way won an award for his bus).  Terry
brought the fire wood and Rob Laffon brought the engine cases!!  We had many
people who had never seen an engine case burn and really got a lesson in how
bright those things can get!!  Erin (No Quarter) brought his guitar along
and was joined by a number of other musicians from all over the campground.
We had a great jam session each night.

The trip to and from the campout was very nice, we took the back highways
and enjoyed going through many nice small towns.  The trip home was the best
though, we took old highway 24, which was less traveled.  I have NEVER had
so many people waving and honking as we did on that stretch of MO highway.
People were so nice, they didn't mind following behind the 3 busses in our
caravan.  One car passing had what looked like a couple big red necks and
when they passed, out pops this tree trunk arm and he just waved his hand as
fast as he could!!!

I've got to go unpack the Westy and Scamp now, but I've got to say if you
could have gone to this campout, but decided for one reason or another not
to go, you missed out on one of the best bus campouts!!
