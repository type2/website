Subject: Missing Studs?

Hello All,

I noticed the other day a stud was missing on my exhaust port manifold as  
well (another list member noted the same thing on his engine) , I was  
told by the PO that the heads were installed by a pro - can these studs  
fall out by themselves?

Thanks in advance!

David.

PS. THANKS Mike W. for the fine posting on this problem!

&gt;On both pairs there are a few studs missing! (exhaust on both pair I
&gt;believe)  What can I do about this?
