Subject: Re: [T2] The first dropped valve seat

Hello Dave   What I use to do in the winter was to take an old album cover 
cut about a 4 inch hole in it and place it over the intake hole at the fan  then 
after driving for awhile I would stop and remove the cover after the engine 
reached operating temp. You will loose a lot of your inside heat but in my case 
I had a gas heater for the inside. I used an old Lawarance Welk album so I 
dont really think I lost a lot but it did get the engine up to temps.  The early 
36,40 HP engines use a system that worked like this .  later and have fun
