Subject: Auto trans shifter cable

The other day/week [time flies when your having fun!] someone 
wanted/needed/had to have [pick one] the shifter cable. I found one 
today at the wrecking yard off a 79. What a PITA removing it!

Anyone want it/need it/have to have it?

Lots of other parts on two buses there, a 78 and a 79.
BTW, I'm in Fresno, Calif.
