Subject: Re: Book with buying advice?

I think Ken is harder on the Idiot Book than is warranted.  The stuff about
grokking your potential purchase sounds worse out of context than in, and
has to do with deciding whether you like the van enough to buy it rather
than a sensible car.  I don't think &quot;busses are *different* from normal
cars&quot; so much as bus people are different from normal people.  Plenty of 
people are working on 15-40 year old cars -- as expensive armatures to 
hold up wax.  WE'RE the only ones that are working on 15-40 year old cars
with the absurd idea that they can carry us, our families, and our 
refrigerators sometimes, in daily use.  The problems we face are quite
similar to what you'd face in driving a 1961 Chevy Bel-Air every day.  It's
just that nobody outside of Cuba does that any more.
