Hey Steve

Don't think it is Silca.  That is all we use at work.

Had a close look at the key head &amp; I think it reads
F(?)S
  11P
Even if that is not correct, Silca normally have their
part nos on one line, at least here in Australia.
Standard R series blank is VO11.  Have never
ordered plastic head version so no totally sure.
