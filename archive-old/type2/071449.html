Subject: Vacuum connections to stock dizzy!
Message-ID: &lt;dae4e33f.24a2ed1d_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Can anyone tell me how the vacuum connections are hooked up on a stock 
distributor on a 1973 Bus with a 1700 type IV engine??  The bus now has a 
single carb with one vacuum connection.  When I got the bus it had no vacuum 
hoses connected to the dizzy.  The dizzy has two places to attach hoses.  
&gt;From what I've been reading one connector is for retard and the other is for 
advance.  Which one is for retard and advance, in relation to the dizzy.  How 
do they work?  Seems that one would pull against the other canceling out any 
movement of the distributor plate.  
Much to learn! 

Thanks,
Paul
