&gt;
&gt;To show you how clueless Insurance companies are, when I insured my
&gt;previous 1969 bug, I paid about $800 for the year.  About 2 weeks
&gt;later, I got a call from them saying that they needed to increase my
&gt;rate to $850 because of an error by the previous salescreep.  OK, not
&gt;too bad since it was still the cheapest I had seen.  A week later,
&gt;another call from the same people.  It seems they had made another
&gt;error, and needed to increase my rate to $950.  Now, this was too
&gt;high for me.  And the reason?  It seems they thought my 1969
&gt;Volkswagen Beetle had Anti Lock brakes!  Hmmm....I don't remember
&gt;that option in the literature!  
&gt;
Aren't anti-lock brakes considered safety equipment? I thought that having
additional safety equipment was a GOOD thing, and since you can stop safer
(in theory), shouldn't the insurance rates go down? I'd start shopping for a
new insurance company (actually, insurance brokers will get you a better
rate than an insurance salesman).

Up here, we have one car insurance company in Saskatchewan - the provincial
government. Overall they are ok, but they still can't tell me my my '85
Nissan 200SX costs me more to insure than my buddies '96 Ford pickup. I
doubt that my Nissan is worth more than the pickup, and Japanese parts
aren't THAT expensive. The 200SX is NOT a sports car (at least the non-turbo
model isn't). I guess they don't like imports. 

Obvw: If I want collision coverage for my bug, I will have to have it
appraised - I can only get PL&amp;PD otherwise. When my bug's restoration is
complete, it's appraised value will be higher than the Nissan, but it will
still be much cheaper to insure.
