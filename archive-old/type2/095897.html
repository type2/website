Hello again everyone,

First I just wanted to thank everyone who took the time to respond to my =
post or any post.
This list has really saved me a lot of time, $, and aggravation.  So than=
k you all.

As most of you may have noticed I am very excited about my plans to move =
from the CA bay area to Chapel Hill, NC.  I will be leaving around July 8=
th and traveling through Colorado to pick someone up.  I will then be tra=
veling to NJ where I will spend a week with family.  Then it will be sout=
h to NC.  I plan to arrive in NC sometime in August.  Other than that it =
is pretty much up in the air.  Anyone have any recommendations of places =
to visit, places/people to see, places to camp, etc.  Anyone know of any =
shows or campouts along the way.  (I know there are plenty in NC and will=
 be seeing many of you there.)

Also, the important part of making sure the bus makes it.  Any recommenda=
tions, comments, concerns?
The bus is being taken to Fred's VW tomorrow to be inspected.  I will do =
a tune up before I leave.  Any thought on what to pack and how to best ut=
ilize the space.

Thanks everyone,
Kyle 79 Westy w/ auto tranny
Palo Alto, CA on my way to Chapel Hill, NC  =20
