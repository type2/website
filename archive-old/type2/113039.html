Subject: pump, tank, what's wrong?

Every now and then I can hear my pump on my 78 making noise.  A while
back the pump was making noise and I wasn't able to accellerate, so I
bought a brand new pump.  Well, then the new pump started making noise,
so I got it exchanged for another new one.  Well, now this one is making
noise.

My mechanic says that the pump will make noise when the pump is getting
insufficient fuel flow.  I've taken the hose off and the fuel flows
pretty freely.  I've also blown air up into the tank.  This seems to be
a relatively intermittant noise.  Sometimes it purrs quietly, sometimes
it's noisy.

I thought maybe something is landing on the inlet?  I don't know what to
do next.  Anyone have any suggestions?

Thanks,
Mike
