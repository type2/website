There are a lot of good deals out there if you look, I had a 68 Dormobile
for sale on the net for over 2 months for $2500.00 dollars, this was a
mechanically sound, rust free, complete Dormie, that could have been driven
anywhere, all it needed was some cosmetics (camper interior) and someone
would of had a nice Dormie, it is finally gone to the first person who
looked at it in person and they thanked me for letting them steal it for the
2500 they paid for it.

From what I've seen in recent years baywindow buses have definitely turned
the corner on pricing and are headed back up.  This was really obvious at
OktoBugFest [Puyallup, WA fairgrounds] last weekend.

There were several Bays for sale there, and even truly ratty and trashed
rigs were priced at least twice what they'd have been asking [and getting] a
year or so ago.

One '71 Westfalia that was partially &quot;restored&quot; with a so-so paint job and a
recent engine rebuild was priced at $5,800.  The camper interior was
incomplete, the upholstery was ragged and torn, and the only clean and shiny
part was the newish paint.  There was no shortage of interested customers,
and not a peep about the price.

A friend chose not to put his '69 European-spec Westy for sale at Puyallup
because he thought it was too beat and tired to attract interest.  In fact,
there were plenty of early bay buses for sale there in far worse condition.
The cheapest I saw was a gutted and rusted out '68 or '69, with mismatched
and worn out tires and hacked holes everywhere that was priced at $2,900.

It won't be long before parts vendors pick up on this trend, and we'll find
ourselves in the same boat as the splitty owners.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  My feeling is the Internet is helping to push prices up. You can still
get one for a decent price, but not
from someone on the net!  &lt;&lt;
