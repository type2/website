Subject: Re: [T2] AIRS - Clutch went out near SF! UPDATE

Hey Everyone,
So, I dropped the engine and pulled off the pressure plate.  The clutch
disk decided that it wanted to disintegrate on the pressure plate side.
   So, tomorrow morning I'm going to hit up the parts shop for a new disk
and pressure plate (from one of the stores you guys recommended) and pop
the engine back in and continue on my road trip.  Thanks for all the
suggestions on stores!!

Mike
