&gt; &gt;      No, if you look you'll see the ports are different shapes as well,
&gt; &gt; use different gaskets, no way to make it work.
&gt;
&gt; In Theory, anyway. In practice, I have a hacksawed '76 manifold bolted up
&gt; to a '79 head and it works.


This is similar to the results that AVP have reported.  Leonard, the owner,
insists that in actual use the difference in the shape of the ports on
'72-79 heads is so small that the copper gasket will fill in the difference,
allowing you, in practice, to use any heat exchanger on any year head
without an exhaust leak.  A few customers who have tried this have reported
similar results.  If you can get a tight seal, there certainly is some
benefit to mixing and matching.  For example, the '72-74 heat exchanger and
exhaust setup is both less expensive and better quality than what's
currently available for '75-78.
