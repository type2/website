Subject: RE: [T2] Engine removal question.



&gt; &gt; When removing the engine I just have to put away the bumper=20
&gt; and the 4
&gt; &gt; big screws holding the cut away body-piece. Put your floor=20
&gt; jack under
&gt; &gt; the engine, get off the engine screws and just pull it out.=20
&gt; No need to
&gt; &gt; even raise your bus.
&gt;=20
&gt; Now that's a cool idea! I wouldn't do that to a Porsche - but=20
&gt; to the Bus -
&gt; hot damn! You could pull the engine anytime you wanted with=20
&gt; minimal effort!

I like that idea, but I don't know how to weld.  Wonder if there
could be a way to do it without welding?
