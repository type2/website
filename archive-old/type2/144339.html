Thank you phil as always........i got the bus back running again but wasnt going any further till i knew for sure about the little noise box was???..... 
i crunk the bus without finish charging the battery back and she fired right up first try even though i did have to give her a little gas,.... she started to purrrr..... i finished recarging the battery after testing to see if the alternator was the verdict knowing it was... when i pulled the old alternator off sheeees that bad boy stunk to high heaven like electricl burnt smell or like some of those burnt cases we split open shoooooe weeeeee it stunk.... so yep yep it was the alternator...
 
 
now to get the shift rod fixed so i can shuft gears LOL.. i think the cotter pin at the bottom of the rod  or key rather has broken maybe...? will know later tonight ....going to take it all apart and see whats broke in there... i cant get into 4rd or forth or reverse anymore.... something insdie feels broke and binding it up form doing so....??
from the shematics in the bentley i am shooting for the cotter key to be broken maybe&gt;???

Chris, the little black box is a static arrestor to
help stop raido noise, the only wires you have to be
concerned with are B+, which has the rubber boot over
it(10mm nut), it goes to the soloniod on the(Red wire)
starter. The plug has D+ &amp; DF, with D- below them,
these three plug into the voltage regulator with the
blue wire coming out of the plug for the alternator
light(the black wire that is at the regulator is not
needed it was used for the test circuit. Phil
