HEY LIST WHATS UP
I JUST STARTED ON MY 76 BUS AND WAS HOPING FOR SUGGESTIONS
ON REPLACMENT OF MY EXHAUST.
I WOULD LIKE TO REPLACE THE WHOLE THING INCLUDING HEATER BOXES
PROBLEM AS MOST OF YOU KNOW,  TOO MANY N/A PARTS!!! 
DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR REPLACING WITH A STREET LEGAL , QUIET , 
AFFORDABLE SOLUTION???? 
ANY HELP WOULD BE WELCOME
THANKS
