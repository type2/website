Subject: Re: Expedient Parts Washer

Due to the elimination of ozone depleting substances, businesses are 
using a fancy version of a dishwasher for cleaning parts.  I've been 
wondering the same thing as West.  Thinking about getting a used 
washer and set it up in the garage for cleaning parts only.  I don't 
want to mix my food with my bus parts. I've tasted both and I prefer 
my own cooking to grease/dirt combo (but just by a slim margin).

Now, what does one USE in the dishwasher as a cleaning agent?
Another question for the environmentally friendly.  What would this 
do to my septic system? (I'm out in the boonies) and conversely what 
would this do to centralized sewage treatment? (It probably can 
handle it without much problem, is my guess)

&gt;  So I'm back to washing the heads in the kitchen sink and I'm 
&gt; thinking that altho I've never cared for dishwashers, I could get
&gt; a half case or two heads in one real nicely.

&gt;  What do you think?     west
