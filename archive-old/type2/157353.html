The frequent debate:  FI &amp; Electronic Ignition versus
Carbs and Points.
    
That debate is solved in my state.  If your car is 75
or newer, it can't be EMISSIONS modified and still
pass the emissions tests.  Unless of course they don't
look carefully during the inspections every other
year.  :D

&gt; &lt;&lt;Nothing can be more frustrating than a non
&gt; fuctional AFC system---&gt;&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;&lt;True but why does it have to be that way...&gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; That's why I mentoned it Richard--
&gt; If it's true--forget about it.
