&gt;   Just a couple o' questions... 1) I haven't seen many baywindows with
&gt; Empi wheels. Why is this? I'm considering 5-spoke Empi's for my 68
&gt; kombi, but before I invest, does anyone know if they are

Empi 8's in the wide-5 pattern?  (the 68 should use the wide 5 lug
pattern..)

A few things to consider:  These will be 15&quot; wheels, and require 15&quot;
tires....195..what...70's? maybe 65's? Not sure...Chances of finding a
load C or load D tire in that size is probably pretty slim.  Or move up to
a taller tire, and deal with the change in gearing, and the error with the
speedometer.

Also, these wheels were designed with the weight, load,  and cornering
stresses of a bug in mind, not those of a bus.  This could cause premature
failure of the wheel.

Next, the offset of these wheels is likely incorrect for a bus, and could
cause premature bearing/spindle failure...

And you may have to deal with width/clearance issues as well.

If you still decide to use them, find one you can rent or borrow, and take
it to a tire shop, after deciding what size tire oyu would like to use on
it.

Have htem mount .one. tire on .one. wheel, and put that wheel first on the
front, then on the rear, to check clearance of wheel wells, trailing arms,
etc.  Jounce the suspension firmly, as well as move the steering through
its full range, to check for interference.

Cheaper to find out now, at the cost of one or two tire mountings, then
later after you chew up new tires...

&gt; interchangeable with the stock rims? BTW, the PO put 70's era bus rims
&gt; on it.

70's era?  The only 70&quot;s bus hweels htat should fit a stock-equipment 68
would be from 1970.  71-79 uses a smaller 5 lug pattern that is not
compatable.  (and adaptors are plain unsafe.)

it is possible that both the front and rear brake components have been
changed to upgrade to the later brakes...this owuld allow the use of the
later wheels.

If this is the case, then the wide 5 empi's (nor the narrow 4's) will
.not. fit.
