Subject: RE: [T2] What about diesel conversions?

Someday I would love to do this. The biggest problem isn't only getting a 
TDI engine to fit and set it all up correctly but the tranny has to be 
totally geared differently. Diesel engines have much much lower RPMS than 
gas engines - you'll have to have different gears put in your tranny.

I think it would be awesome to be running off french fry grease, many people 
are doing it now. Using this you have to have a preheat system as the fuel 
turns solid.


It would be a huge huge project.

&gt;Do Jetta diesel engines
&gt;fit in a bus?  Then one could go greasel or biodeiesel.  The 1.6 vanagon
&gt;diesel I have been warned about, but what of some of the other german
&gt;diesels out there? Fit in a bus or AC Vanagon?
