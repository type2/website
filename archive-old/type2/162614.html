&gt; &gt; Plase refresh me on why disconnecting the battery  while the engine is
&gt; &gt; running on a fuel injections system is a no - no.  Thanks

&gt; The battery acts like a power conditioner. It buffers spikes and
&gt; brownouts to provide relatively clean power to the computer, stereo,
&gt; etc. The act of disconnecting and connecting the battery will also
&gt; cause power spikes. The ECU is too expensive to risk.

the battery is also part of the charging circuit and if disconected it
will blow the voltage regulator.
