Check the electromagnetic fuel shutoff valve that sticks out of the side =
of the carburetor. It's a cylinder with a wire going to it or it has a =
spade connector on the end of it. It should have + 12 V going to it (a =
wire from the 15 side of the coil) or the fuel is shut off at idle =
(assuming that the carb is a Solex 34 PICT or equivalent).

Also, the only way to set the ignition timing accurately is to use a =
stroboscopic timing light and set the 009 dizzy at 30-32 degrees BTDC _at_ =
3500+ RPM.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Hi  Folks,
I'm at my ends wits right now.  Here's the scenario.  My '71 ( AK engine =
)=20
ran like crap five months ago.  I couldn't adjust #3 valve so I let it=20
sit.  I replaced the heads, spark plugs, ignition, set the timing (009 =
at=20
7.5 BTDC statically).  It won't idle.  I noticed a crack in the vacuum =
hose=20
to the brake booster so I replaced it.  How do I check if I have a =
vacuum=20
leak else where?  I believe its the carb.  I check the idle air screw =
(big=20
one) and it's two turns out.  What else can I do.  My family are suppose =
to=20
go camping today  but....  Thanks in advance.
