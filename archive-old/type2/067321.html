Subject: Crack in sliding door 75 Deluxe

I was looking at my sliding door yesterday because I noticed that it wasn't
closing tightly.  I noticed that the latch was broken, no little hook, and
upon further inspection, I noticed a small CRACK in the stinkin door.  It was
directly above the latch on the edge of the door, if you were looking at the
part that doesn't show when the door is shut.  It is about an inch and a half
long, and is starting to rust, and allows the door to flex somewhat.  MY
QUESTION IS:  can I weld this, rather, May I weld this?  will it help?  can
one weld directly onto the door, if there is very little rust?  I am an
adequate welder, but would have it done by someone who does that sort of
thing.  

Thanks.
