Subject: Re: [T2] Another key question

Sean, are you sure that cylinder is sealed? Usually there is a very
tiny set screw. I thought mine was sealed too until I took it too the
locksmith to get it keyed. Then he scraped some dirt off and showed me
the set screw. I always have my locks keyed aliked by the locksmith
rather than try to locate new stuff. Sometimes I can key them myself
if the cylinder has the right combination of insert sizes I can move
around.

I don't worry too much about other people's keys working in my locks
either. I have learned after many years of VW's that sometimes if I
don't have a key for a lock, one of my other VW keys will fit it.
Mostly I just consider the lock to be a deterrent to the casual thief.
The determined ones will obviously get what they are after.

John
