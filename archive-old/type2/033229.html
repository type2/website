Subject: Re: Luggage Rack

My 72 Campmobile was missing the three spacers that hold up the rear of the
luggage rack.  From what I hear they are very hard to find so I recently made my
own.

Materials:
A short length of 1 1/2 inch thin walled pipe.  You'll need 1 1/2 inches
altogether, but you need more to hang on to it while cutting.
6 - 1 1/2 inch steel fender washers.
3 - 1 inch stainless steel fender washers.
3 - #10  2 inch long stainless steel sheet metal screws.
6 inches of 1/2 inch box tubing.
A piece of tire inner-tube.
weather strip adhesive.
silicone sealer.

Process:
Using one of the fender washers as a pattern, cut 5 washer sized pieces from the
inner tube and punch a small hole through the middle.
For the two outboard spacers:  Cut two pieces of the 1 1/2 inch pipe, 3/4 of an
inch long.
Braze a fender washer over each end of the two pieces of pipe.  Use some weather
strip adhesive to attach a rubber washer over each fender washer.  Smear a glob
of silicone over the screw hole in the roof of the bus then place each spacer
assembly over the hole.  Put a stainless steel washer on a stainless steel screw
and loosely install through the luggage rack and spacer.

For the center spacer:  Place the 6 inch piece of box tubing under the rear
center of the luggage rack.  Slide fender washers under the tubing until you
have the correct height for the spacer.  Braze the fender washers to the center
of the box tubing then drill a hole that goes through the center of the washers
and through the box tubing.  Attach the rubber washer to the fender washers and
install this assembly with the rubber washer against the top of the bus.

Notes:
I used the box tubing in the center because my rack was starting to crack in the
center.  I thought this would help distribute the load.
I used #10 ss screws because the holes in my roof had become enlarged over the
years.  #8 is probably closer to the original size.
Paint the spacers with a high quality primer and paint.
Turn a garden hose on the roof and check for leaks so there will be no surprises
during a rainstorm.
The 1972 Campmobile has the luggage rack in the rear.

Disclaimer
I have never seen what the original spacers look like.  I asked the list and got
a few different answers as to the size of these spacers so I had to go with what
I thought was right.  My luggage rack sits pretty good now.  If anything, I
probably should have made the spacers a quarter inch higher.

&gt; Hello all,
&gt;
&gt;  Does anyone know
&gt; where I can get ahold of the three spacers for the rear luggage rack?  The
&gt; ones that raise the fiberglass level with the front section.  My roof looks
&gt; lamely uneven and I've already tried stacking washers (didn't work too well).
&gt;  Any ideas?
