It will take a while for the smell to go away, and unless your HE's are
intact, that is the inner pipes carrying the exhaust gases, you will not
eliminate this problem. Fortunately on the type 4 the inners tend to be
quite solid and its more likely that any fumes are coming from gunge getting
inside the outer part. The ultmate cure may be to replace the HE's, an
expensive job in parts and labour. I just redid mine by doing a lot of
welding, but the time involved would have been better spent on other things
and I should have gone out and bought new.

As to adjusting up the cables and flap valves, I also checked Haynes and
have asked on the list and various newsgroups. Nobody seems to know and I
think I will be breaking new ground if I work this out. On the face of it it
seems obvious that the two cables connect up front to a lever in the cab -
on the RHD version its the right hand red lever. Lever up for off means the
cables and flapper valves are in the relaxed position. At the flap valve the
lever is full back for off and the heat all leaks out underneath the bus.
Pull the cab lever down and the cables pull the flap valve open sending heat
to the cab..

However so far I haven't been able to adjust the cables so that the flap
valves can be set to entirely open, that is maximum heat to cab, none
leaking out underneath, and also entirely closed, no heat to cab and all
leaking out underneath. I can get one or the other of these states but not
both. The secret seems to be to get some adustment in the length of travel
of the levers either at the cab or on the valves and neither of these are
adjustable as far as I can see.


The centre red lever is to send the heat to either the dash or down below,
and the blue lever opens the fresh air vent in the grille up front, but
these are simple matters.

Will report if I get anywhere with this.
