    I haven't been a very vocal member of the type2 list.  And I really
don't know Josh, except from his web page and his postings to the list.  But
I know that Josh's thoughts, dreams &amp; knowledge have been very helpful to a
great many people.  I know that he has a loving family and many friends.
Josh had more friends than he could have ever  imagined.  And I know that he
will be missed very much.  Reflect on the memories you have of him, and the
love you have for him in your hearts.
