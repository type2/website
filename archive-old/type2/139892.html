&gt; ...&quot;new technology brazing rod, anyone with little or no experience
&gt; can repair cracks, holes, leaks, rivets, broken ears, threads
&gt; or fabricate aluminum, cast aluminum, and cast iron quickly,
&gt; easily, and stronger than new!&quot;
&gt;
&gt; &quot;This new repair technology performs well on aluminum,
&gt; cast aluminum, pot metal, copper, magnesium, and all
&gt;
&gt; Debunkers welcome:)

maybe on fins or such but I sure wouldn't repair a valve seat or something
on the head/cly area.  heck the valve seats probably get hotter than the
brazing source heat.   I would suspect when you get to the &quot;fine print&quot;
they will say &quot;not reccomended&quot; for things that get high heat levels or
some such.

if it sounds too good to be true, it probably isn't
