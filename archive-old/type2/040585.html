Subject: Fuel sender - gas tank seal?

&gt;I was wondering if anyone knew where I could get the fuel sender 
&gt;seal/gasket or my '68? I'd like to clean out the gas tank and maybe treat 
&gt;it but all I see available are seals for the later busses!  Can anyone tell 
&gt;me about these seals? I would think it would need to be replaced, no?

Just switched tanks on our 71 SC (way easy to get to :), and according to 
Bentley..and Haynes, you might also have to change the foam seal around the 
bottom feed through area, and the 4 (?) small area seals that precent the 
tank from &quot;squeaking&quot;. ( I think that was their term). I carefully removed 
the tank..and reused the old ones..as on SC's, to redo is no big deal. 
Haven't had a long road test on it yet..so may be looking for the seals just 
described. Good luck in finding the sender seal..and hope you don't need the 
others.
