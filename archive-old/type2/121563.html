&gt;So today I pulled off the fuel filter and cleaned t out as best as 
&gt;possible. (I didn't get to try to start it yet because I was being burned 
&gt;so badly from the gas that ran down my sleeve that I had to rush home to 
&gt;shower). So, now I plan to charge the battery and then go back and try and 
&gt;start it.
&gt;Is there anything else I should consider besides timing and fuel filter?

Sounds like classic clogged filter symptoms. How much 'stuff' came out the 
back of the filter?? Always clamp the hose from the tank first. Then remove 
or loosen the clamps at the filter. Then twist the filter to loosen the 
hoses from the nipples. Prepare for catching gas. Pull off the tank side 
hose, block the filter nipple with a finger, pull the filter out of the 
other hose while rotating the blocked nipple down. With attention to 
details I get no more than a few drops of gas on my hands. Holding filter 
with fingered nipple down, the tank input side, drain into a clean 
container. If you see clean gas, blow through the filter to determine no 
restriction. If none, it's not the filter. Reuse it. But any resistance to 
flow, or cloud of dust in the drainage, replace the filter. If it's got 
anything like 20,000 miles since last change, reasonable maintenance 
requires replacement as standard insurance of function. Those filters are 
simply not designed to be cleaned and reused. They are designed to TRAP 
particles. The only way to remove the restriction is to replace the filter.

There is just a whole lot of unnecessary stress put on the fuel pump trying 
to suck gas from a restrictive filter. The only way to destroy the life of 
the fuel pump faster is to run it dry. The cost of a filter is peanuts 
compared to the pump.

There is never a good reason to risk bad function on the road or excess 
stress to spendy parts from lack of simple maintenance of designed to be 
cheap in comparison replacement parts. You either prevent these problems by 
following simple instruction or wait for problems to happen for certain. 
Which do you think is less costly in time/money?? I think three filter 
replacements with no failures is far cheaper than one breakdown founded 
upon less cost for filter maintenance. But that's just me. When in comes to 
preventing unnecessary, wasted time/money, I am as cheap as you might ever 
see comes.
