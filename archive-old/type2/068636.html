Subject: Re: Where can I rent a CO meter in East Bay (CA)

&gt;I need the CO meter to properly set idle and timing on my Vanagon.
&gt;I've called all the usual rental places around Lafayette, CA but
&gt;no one I've talked rents them.
&gt;
&gt;Is anyone aware if somebody local rents these things, or am I doomed
&gt;to visit my friendly, knowledgabe, local VW mechanic? &lt;wry grin&gt;
&gt;

  One of the things we all have to start thinking about is clubs 
that can pool these kind of resources.

 In your case, Beth or Tom, I seem to recall that the East Bay area
has an enormous vw club of some sort.

 You need to make some new friends.  :-) it's worth a shot!
