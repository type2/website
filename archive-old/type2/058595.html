Subject: EGR riddle

If a mechanical EGR ('76 on) is attached to the air plenum without the 
linkage or the pipe to the EGR filter, does it seal the plenum? I can't 
tell whether it seals at the top of its action or the bottom, or both.

The answer to this riddle will be applied to a temporary condition, as I 
prevent a nasty vacuum link while trying to find pipe and linkage.

TIA
