Or you could buy a convex mirror and stick it on to the passenger side
mirror.  No saw zal needed

Subject: Fix that suicude cabinet on your westies


&gt; &gt;years to look for.  The one thing I advise *strongly* against is going
&gt; &gt;to the 68-73 westy settup.  The stock settup for those years includes
&gt; &gt;full-height cabinet behind the passenger seat allong the reare quarter.
&gt; &gt;this cabinet creates a *huge* blind spot that IMHO is dead flat unsafe.
&gt; &gt;I have a '73 and call it the &quot;suicide cabinet&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; I've got this set up as well.  If I ever get around to putting the axels
and
&gt; rear tin back on so I can drive my bus, here are my plans...
&gt;
&gt; A year or so ago I met a fella at the coast with a similar set up and he
&gt; showed me what he did.  He basically turned the &quot;closet&quot; section into a
low
&gt; cabinet.  Took a sawz-all and removed the top portion of the cabinet,
right
&gt; at the level where it would (and does) make a great armrest for anyone
&gt; sitting in the seat.  Said he did not even have to remove the cabinet from
&gt; the bus.  I sat in the drivers seat, and it opened that blind spot right
&gt; up.
