Subject: Re: A or B

&gt;I am struggling with a fundamental theory, is ATDC to the left or the 
right
&gt;of TDC with the engine at idle and a strobe illuminating the scene?
&gt;
You're not supposed to think of these kinds of questions, they just 
cause headaches! :-)
You're just supposed to do it :-)



&gt;Which is after and which is before?  If the crank turns clockwise I say 
the
&gt;first is before.  My 71 is timed the first way and I hope that is not 
wrong
&gt;it should be ATDC...

Well as we all know the engine turns clockwise.  TDC = top dead center = 
0 degrees.

Since the engine turns clockwise, points BEFORE top dead center must be 
to the LEFT of the TDC mark on the timing scale (for those of you lucky 
enough to have Type 4 engines).  Points AFTER top dead center are then 
to the right of the TDC mark since they come AFTER TDC in the engine's 
revolution.

The same thing sorta goes for the Type 1 engine except they don't have a 
timing scale, just a notch on the pulley and a seam in the crankcase.  
So this is irrelevant for you with a Type 1, since you just line up the 
notch in the pulley with the seam in the case and blammo, the engine is 
timed (assuming you have the stock pulley).  

Some of the Type 1 pullies have divots in the rear (front is front) rim 
of the pulley for TDC.  If the spec for the car is x degrees BTDC, the 
v-shaped notch for timing will be to the left of the divot.  If the spec 
is x degrees ATDC, then the notch will be to the right of the divot.

Another way to look at it is this:  when the engine is revved, the spark 
is advanced.  Advanced means MORE BTDC.  When you rev the engine with 
the strobe light going, you will see the timing mark move to the left.  
It is advancing to more and more degrees BTDC.

Got it?
Or did I make it more confusing? :-)
