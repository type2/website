&gt;DON'T.  

&gt;you are trying to drive an unknown vehicle into some of the highest
&gt;roughest terrain in the lower 48.  I took my well driven, well known 65
&gt;westy through there some years ago and wondered if I would ever get over
&gt;some of those hills.  between Pagosa Springs and South Fork you have to
&gt;cross Wolf Creek Pass at 10850 ft.  that is one long long slow climb, and
&gt;then don't forget the run down the other side, what kind of shape are the
&gt;brakes in?????   

I have to second this.  I've made the trip from Fort Collins and Boulder to
Durango several times (as a passenger) in a well-tended, well-known Beetle, and
a couple of times we almost didn't make it.  If you aren't familiar with the
vehicle, don't attempt it.  Just don't.  


Now, I gotta tell this story since we're talking about Durango and VWs.  }:) 
The busy folk can skip.  But it's a good story, so...

Once upon a time, in a state far, far away.

We made the trip from Boulder to Alamosa in the beetle, and we suspected when we
began the transmission was marginal.  We figured it'd be okay to drive, though,
and it had lots of new oil, and we carried spare oil and such along with us.  As
it turns out, it was much, much worse than marginal.  

We found this out when it suddenly coughed, died, and dumped its innards into
the road, possibly as an existential protest against the agony that we call
life.  Maybe it's because we were using the transmission to help brake, 'cause
that's a *really* scary stretch of road.  

Those who have made the trip probably know what I mean when I say that we were
somewhere between the point where you begin to think that you might not make it,
and the point where you begin to think that you actually *might*.  Sort of
halfway between.  *Everyone* in the car had a sore right leg from jamming
imaginary brake pedals into the floorpan.  We were all seatbelted, but it wasn't
too necessary, since everyone was shoved back so hard into the seats that it'd
have taken a crowbarand a hydraulic press to pry our butts out of the car.  

Whatever the reason, there was a heck of an oily, geary, jumbly *mess* on the
road, and what really scared us was the fact that this oily geary jumbly mess
was the thing that was supposed to take the motion of the noisy, bangy, spinny
thing in the back of the car, and make the big round rubbery things on the axles
turn really really fast and get us the heck *out* of there.

There was, incidentally, no cell phone in the bug.  Always carry a cell phone if
you're driving in places like that.  It's easier to store than a flare gun,
12-foot neon sign, bullhorn, and incidental equipment for sending smoke signals
and/or semaphore messages.

I got busy inventing swear words.  

So, while I was still muttering and digging through the manuals looking for
&quot;What to do when your transmission barfs unidentifiable things all over a very
sharply slanted road,&quot; the driver gathered these odd-looking bits and pieces of
transmission arcana, and looked at them for a while.  Then he pulled out a rag,
cleaned them, and wired the whole thing together.  Like it was incidental.  &quot;Oh,
gee, these things happen.&quot;  

We drove away.  

I think of that whenever I start thinking that the VW gods are being unfair to
me.  :)
