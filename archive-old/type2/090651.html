Subject: Re: [T2] ugly bus competition

Will.
I've found that you can do anything to your Bus or Vanagon that you want
.......... just don't tell the list.
You have to say it this way ; *I have this friend of mine, yada yada
yada* and everybody just thinks your friend is a blithering idiot.
You just step into third person *persona* and all of their criticism just
rolls off.
And to make you feel better I've known people that named their VW Vans,
Pinto and Psoriasis because they were so scaley but they still loved
their busses.
Many people in old splitties and bays display their rust with the pride
of war medals, it never stops them from going where they want and these
old experienced vehicles are always welcome at any VW event.
