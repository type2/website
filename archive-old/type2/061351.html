Hi Volks,

Well every time this is mentioned it causes much discussion, so I've decided
join in and to come to some reasoned conclusions. If you disagree please don't
take it personaly. So donning my anti-flame suit heres what I think -

Some people will pull the engine, others will cut a hole in the luggage area
floor.

Many folk won't cut a hole because they want to keep their ride as close to
original as possible, I respect that.

Others may not have the time, facilities, or mechanical inclination, so they
take a more pragmatic approach and just cut the hole. Are they wrong to do so?
Off course not. The VW repair procedure was to cut the hole - they even made a
special plate to cover it up afterwards.

Does it effect the the structural integerty? - off course not, VW would have
been slamed through the courts of Europe and the USA years ago if that was the
case. And they certainly would not be putting this hatch into every T2
(loaf/bay) transporter that is comming off the production line today. For your
information it's different from the old European hatch being circular and
about 8 to 9 inches (220mm) in diameter - bigger than the hole most people
would cut.

Others fear a petrol smell due to cutting the hole - to those I would say
there will only be a smell if theres a leak - filler necks, sender gaskets,
tubes joining vents to tank are all made of rubber and 20 to 30 year old
rubber may well be perished. I would rather a petrol smell led me to repair a
defective feul system than have my bus go up in flames.

There were also two types of fuel sender unit used on Eurpoean production T2s
- a long cylindrical one and one with a float on an arm (rather like a toilet
cistern ball float) - Sorry I don't know what years they were used.
I suspect (that if you are going in through the engine compartment) there
would be sufficient clearence to change change the second type without
removing the tank, but if you have already removed engine and firewall it
would be a small amount of work to pulll the tank, so its probably accademic.

Others have mentioned that its possible to pull the tank over the top of an FI
Type 4 engine (JUST); so they must have removed the fire wall first so there
may be milage in changing the scond type of sender without pulling the tank in
this case.

If the jobs done well I'm reluctant to criticise someone for changing the
sender in the way recomended by VW (ie cutting the hatch). But personaly I
would come down on the side of accessing the tank through the engine bay; not
because I'm anti cutting an access hatch, but because after 20+ years the
rubber bits will (almost certainly) need to be replaced, any crud can washed
out of the tank, the intank filter checked and cleaned, and any rust examined
and treated. 

Good luck
Bob

(Is it safe to take my anti-flame suit off yet?)
