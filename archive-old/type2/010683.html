Listees,

I must get rid of some valuable bus stuff. I hate to throw this stuff out!

Front seats from '79. good shape, one has a rip.
Tire rack for mounting spare on nose.
Complete set of seatbelts (lap only)for front two seats of '71 (or any year for that matter).

Please save this stuff. Free. you pay postage.
