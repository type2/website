&gt; Could someone tell me if they're on my bus and if so where to look.

Jonny,

There is a Yug.  There are no drain holes (like Yug mentioned) in
your '64.  You have the soft top and no water should be getting
in to be drained.  Sunroofs on '68 and later buses are &quot;hard&quot; and
slide in a channel which has drains because the weatherstrip
can't keep out all the water forever.

So, if you're getting water inside, something else needs
attention.  Either there's a hole in your vinyl/canvas or the
front bar (with the handle) needs to be adjusted to tighten the
seal.  There's also a strip of rubber between the vinyl/canvas
and the bar which helps keep things watertight.  Yours may be
missing (if the vinyl was replaced) or just deteriorated.

Can you identify the conditions under which you get water?
