&gt;OOOPPSSS!  I just assumed that the Grand Canyon was in Colorado.
&gt;It's a good thing I had planned on going to Arizona anyway!   Can
&gt;you tell I'm from the &quot;Deep South&quot; and never been out West? 
&gt;&lt;sheepish look here&gt;
&gt;

That's ok, Juli...seems that most foreign tourists think that the
Grand Canyon is in Nevada...that's where all the air tours are based.

Btw...there's a campsite 60mi down a dirt road from Fredonia, AZ (or
about 90mi S of St. George, UT) where you can camp right on the edge
of the Inner Gorge of the Grand Canyon. I mean 2 feet out and 3000 feet
down.

Busses by the Arch? How 'bout Busses at the Abyss?

Cheers and good luck
