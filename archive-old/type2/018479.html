Subject: Used Seatbelts (long)
Message-ID: &lt;37630A0C.26C7D9D9_at_capital_dot_net&gt;

Hi all, Dave K from Albany here.

Recently there has been a discussion about using seat belts from a
Rabbit or some such in a bread loaf.  Good idea if they are like new and
fit, but I need to add my $.05 worth here.  You must NOT use old seat
belts from old cars, especially from a wrecked car.  Here's why.

 It seems that I once worked for a crash test facility for New York
State DOT.  I designed the instrumentation for the various tests.  One
of the things that I learned about seat belts is they must stretch a
little during a crash.  The reason for this is that when you crash you
are thrown against them with a least a couple of &quot;Gs&quot; of force, usually
more. When your body hits the belt, it is like hitting a wall.  The
reason that the belt is kept sung to the body is to reduce the traveling
distance to the first object struck.    The stretchiness of the belt
absorbs some of the impact and lessens the injury to the body.

As seat belts age they tend to get dirty with stuff from McDonalds and
the like.  This dirt will make the belt stiff.  A stiff belt will not
have the give that it should have and will cause serious injury to the
body if you hit it with any significant force.

A seat belt from a wrecked car is even worse.  Here the fibers are
pulled to their design limit resulting in no possible stretch at all.
To prove my point, in the owners manual of every Volvo, there is a
statement that informs the owner to replace the seat belts in the event
of a accident.  Now I don't give a hoot about Volvos but the point here
is this, this manufacturer recognizes that seat belts stretched in an
accident must be replaced.

I am of the opinion that driving with stiff seat belts is nearly as
dangerous as driving with original fuel line.  What you don't know can
be very dangerous.

If you insist on using used belts, make sure that they have some
stretchyness left in them.  Go find a new car and feel the things.  Then
go looking for belts.  I think you find that you will wind up doing what
I did and order either a set of original belts or perhaps get a set of
generic belts from your favorite supplier.

In my 76 Westy, I used retractable seat belts from J. C. Whitney.  I
found that the original belt mounting holes (for the lack of a better
term) would accept the bolts supplied from J. C. Whitney (JCW). The
threads matched and screwed right in.   I used the supplied &quot;L&quot; bracket
to mount the retractor vertically behind the front seat and I mounted
the &quot;shoulder loop&quot; with the  original hardware.  I had to replace the
original buckle with the JCW one and used the original bolt here as
well.

I noted the following things about this setup.  The J.C. Whitney
retractable belts will not latch gently to relieve that annoying tension
on the shoulder.  This can be a bit of a problem for short drivers with
the seat pulled forward.  I keep the seat full to the rear and it
doesn't seem to bother.  The are also a little long for this
application, and will not fully retract.  This means that the belt will
fall out the door every time you get out.  I just stuff it back behind
the seat when I get out.  You get used to it.  Finally it would be nice
if the buckle end could be made to stay near the edge of the seat
instead of lying on the floor.  But as I said, you get used to it.

I suspect that I may have touched on a sensitive subject here.  If so,
let the flames begin.  I just tested the delete key and find that it is
working fine!
