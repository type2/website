Subject: Do breadloafs sag naturally?

I've been looking at my recently acquired (1 month today) '71 Westy and
notice that it has a distinctive slant towards the rear.  It's not a hardcore
lowrider look but it definitely sags.  I've been trying to compare it to
other buses and pictures of buses but can't make up my mind if mine is an
exaggeratted tilt.  Could I get some feedback from the breadloaf community
out there?  Does your breadloaf look like it's lower in the back than in the
front?  Is this a natural phenomenon?  If so, why?  Because the engine's in
the back?
