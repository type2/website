There was a aircooled man with a few bugs and busses out back of his shop.  He does restorations, and has a cool white chopped single cab out front.  You can find him on Rt 250 West of C-ville about 3 miles out of town.  Near the Wal-mart on the left side going towards Waynesboro.  He can direct you to a few other yards in the area.  There was also a VW salvage yard on I-64 just off of I-81 East of Staunton.  It only a few hundred yards off the interstate, on the southside of the highway.

I have a bug friend down there that knows of another yard or so, email me and I'll see if he know the directions.  That area is hot with bugs and busses.

There is this old guy in Waynesboro with a crew cab, 2 splitties, and a westie rotting away in his yard, and won't part with them.  They have haven't moved an inch in quite a few years.  I've asked him twice, but he won't budge.  What a shame.

Hope this helps,
Snoopster
