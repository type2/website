Subject: Heater Blowers and Aux Cooling
Date: Tue, 17 Jul 2001 13:17:00 US/Mountain

Fellow list member J. Zupper and I were just talking about auxiliary heater 
blowers.  I've got a pair of 914 (1-outlet) blowers mounted in my 73 with one 
going to each of the intakes for the heating system.  But I've been thinking 
about swapping them out for a pair of bilge blowers (more air, less power draw 
I would think).  But then you've got the problem of hot air backing up into 
them when you're not using them.

So.  You could fashion some sort of flap like VW/Porsche used on their aux 
blowers.  But why not just wire the blowers to a 170 degree thermostat and let 
them run all the time when it's hot?  The heater control boxes have those nifty 
bypasses anyway so if you didn't have your heater turned on the air passing 
through the heat exchangers would help to cool the exhaust (and exhaust 
valves).  

Additionally, the thermostat would allow the blowers to continue running and 
moving air in your engine compartment even after you shut off your motor.  And 
we all know how hot it gets in there when you shut down!!

What do you all think?  Anyone ever gone this route?
