Subject: Re: [T2] Engine problems :(

The VW mechanic here recommended adjusting the valves just to see if 
they got out of whack.

The reason I don't think it's a valve is because of the oil spray that 
I'm getting all over the enging compartment.  I'm guessing that the 
spray is being caused by a leaky piston causing blow-by cuz otherwise 
wouldn't the presurized air just leak into the intake or exhaust manifolds?

plus it's burning a little oil..

I guess it could be both rings and seats.. errr

Mike

&gt; This isn't real consistent with the knocking, but there might be a
&gt; dropped valve seat or (in my case) a burnt valve.
&gt; 
&gt; What did you notice on the #4 valve that made you adjust it? or just
&gt; trying things.
