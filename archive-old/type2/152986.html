Subject: 2nd Annual Buses By the Beach BUS BRRR Winter Campout!

Join the always interesting Buses by the Beach
(www,busesbythebeach_dot_com) gang at Pokagon State Park in Angola,
Indiana for our 2nd Annual Bus Brrr! Winter Camp on Saturday and
Sunday February 10-11th, 2006.
(http://www.indianatraveler_dot_com/state_parks/pokagon.htm)

As always, we combine our love of the venerable VW Bus with fellowship
and fundraising for our favorite charity, The Phoenix Society for Burn
Survivors.  (http://www.phoenix-society_dot_org/)

Last year's inaugural event was a blast!

We rode the crazy refrigerated dual toboggan run (45 mph-faster than a
Split Window Bus!) after setting up camp, then returned to 3 kinds of
famous Buses By the Beach Chili and a roaring campfire.  LIMBO
Magazine did a feature of us having a good time and getting an early
start to the Bus Season.  We had 2-3 &quot; of snow on Sunday morning, but
it just made for good photo opportunities!

Dress in layers. There will be electric hookups available for all and
small 1000 watt heater will keep the interior of the bus nice an
toasty.  All campsites are located near pit toilets.  Alcohol is
permitted in February, but not obnoxious drunks.

So fire up the Boxer and point the Bus towards Northeastern Indiana
and join us for a great time and help out a worthy cause!

Pokagon is a State Park and bringing in firewood is prohibited due to
the Emerald Ash Borer Beetle.  There will be firewood available.  We
will have specially designed hoodie sweat shirts for sale
commemorating the event.

Any questions, Pmail me at pnocean_at_earthlink_dot_net or Brien at
briendews_at_charter_dot_net.

See you there!
