Subject: sliding window parts???

Ok, I've heard that parts for sliding windows(78 std bus) are NLA from 
anywhere!

Say it ain't so.  Seems that the parts I need are used
on vanagon sliding windows also.  We don't have many late model vanagons 
around here, but I saw an 81 today in a car lot and it has the same 
sliding windows as are on my 78.


The same window to body moding rubber seems to be the same all the way
up to 1990?

I need the plastic slide inserts and the rubber sliding glass moulding.
Anything else I can get if possible.


Anyone????  Vendors??

My 78 is going to look pretty good with new paint and rubber, but the old 
cracked sliding window stuff is sure going to detract from the overall 
appearance.

Any hints, tips, techniques??

 Cheers, dave
