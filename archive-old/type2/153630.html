Subject: brake calipers

I have not been keeping up to date on brake calipers ...
today I had the left caliper fail... seals blew out.

I picked up a pair of calipers.. right,, and left side according to the box.

first question...
they are &quot;semi loaded&quot; ........ what the heck is that??

the left one had the line enter on the top...
mounting hole with the shoulder bolt on the top
2 bleeder screws...
grinding marks where the mfg name was in the casting.. so I have no idea if 
they are ATE ,, vw ,, audi.. or girling..&lt;doubt that tho&gt;
the piston cut out relief are positioned,,, down.

the right one.. looks like a different manufacturer
 has the line enter on the top..
mounting hole with the shoulder bolt on the top.... that is how I determine 
left from right.
2 bleeder screws....
ATE with VW and the audi symbol on it..
the piston relief would be on the top

Does it matter where the piston relief goes???

The caliper I took off has the brake line enter the body in the middle.. 
this one looks like it could be left or right.. mounting hole with the 
shoulder bolt on the top makes it a left .... and the piston relief is down.

even though they look different.. they are basically a VW caliper...
the only technical difference is the piston relief is up on one,, down on 
the other..
they both are in boxed marked SEMI LOADED

The stock guy pointed out he only had the 2 ... and didn't have the fully 
loaded ones..

back to question one,,, what the heck is that??

I only replaced the left... the right is fine...
new pads ,,  serviced the wheel bearings..
done.

is there something I should be concerned about....... LOL........ I am 
leaving for a 1200 kilometer trip
I am leaving Wed evening...
Thanks
