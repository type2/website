Subject: &quot;westy&quot; and other names

 A recent post on what exactly a Westy was also ran down some other definitions;
I've got one I'd like to see if we can nail:
I own a 70 9-passenger bus with NO walkthrough, green paint to the
roofline, grey
interior. NO spare tire well in back (so where did it go?).
The tag on the back hatch reads SALINA, which I used to think was the
dealer name.
HOWEVER... recently, two other buses moved here (austin) that are EXACT
duplicates,
and they have the same plate. I refuse to believe that ONE dealership
specialized
in green 9 seaters, and we all just happened to move here. But you never know.
Any answers?
Craig
