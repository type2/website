Subject: Vanagon heat

I've wondered why the rear deck ahead of the engine compartment gets so hot,
often hotter than the engine cover itself. Yesterday while driving around in
90* heat I noticed that the situation wasn't being helped by the fact that
heat was pouring into the van despite the control being firmly off. I knew I
had a heat flapper that was likely stuck open and probably the on I had tried
to repair earlier but I couldn't remember which side it was. Before crawling
under the vehicle, on a whim I felt the rear deck and sure enough one side
was much, much cooler than the other. That side of course was the open
flapper which was funneling the heat into the van rather than exhausting the
heat into the area under the rear deck. 

I'll grant you that the insulation in that area is likely shot from being
soaked in ATF in an earlier life, but it does seem that vw could have put a
little more thought into directing the hot air away from this relatively
confined space.
