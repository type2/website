Subject: ramblings. it's hot!

Greetings all,

        The engine for my '72 Westie is now in about as many pieces as possible.  This 
weekend I hope to take the crank and case in to have it measured and machined if
necessary and order bearings.  It would really thrill me to get the beast going 
before winter, but I don't think that is going to happen.  The engine is a 1600 
DP.  The motor looks good except for those cooked pistons.  My brother, who is 
an airplane mechanic, looked at the bearings and gave me,  &quot;Eh, they don't look 
too bad.&quot;  Which in the dialect of northern MN means they look good.  All in all
the motor looks solid, but deserving of a full overhaul.  So I'll take my time 
and do it right , which means money, which I don't have a lot of right now.  I'm
even having VW dreams.  Me tooling down the country highway in my van, breeze 
blowing through my thick, full head of hair (it's my dream damit), waving at one
perfect VW after another.  
        What isn't a dream though, is the fact that Type II's are popping up all over 
the neighborhood.  At first I chalked it up to the &quot; I got one now I see them 
everywhere syndrome&quot;, but they are parked where they weren't before.  One block 
over a '69 Westie with an ever expanding oil spot under the sump plate.  Just a 
half a block over a '75 Westie hasn't moved all summer.  And just last night I 
spot a green splitty panel that's been lowered somehow.  Looks really nice, but 
I ask 'why?'
        So  I will spend the winter with Bob Hoovers admonition of &quot;don't let her 
become a hanger queen&quot; on my mind.  That one stung a little since I used to fly 
quite a bit before I married and became a good family man. (For those wondering,
a hanger queen is an airplane that looks great, but rarely sees the outside 
because of one reason or another).  My favorite hangar queen story is about a 
local doctor who had his Cessna 170 tied up at a small airport for two years.  
One day he decides to come out and fly.  He fires the old girl up and takes to 
the sky... for about 30 second.  That's about when the first of 2 or 3 gallons 
of water hits his carb.  See,  he had checked the petcock drains under the 
wings, but usually you get only a few drops or maybe an ounce of water in your 
gas, so you see it.  His jar was full of water so it looked like all gas.       
He was O.K.  His plane is probably part of someones beer can right now.
        Speaking of airplanes, I used to fly one with an exhaust gas temperature gauge.
You used it to adjust your fuel mixture, which is adjusted from inside the 
plane.  Full rich for takeoff,  lean it out for cruising and altitude, with an 
eye to the temp. to prevent overheating.  How could I rig up that deal for my 
bus?  Have a big knob in my cab for adjusting my mixture.  Of course I'll have 
to install dual Nav/Com's, a transponder, strobes, emergency beacon,...
say , there are two guys in white coats just showed up.. gotta go,  bye.
