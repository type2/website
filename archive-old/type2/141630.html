Subject: Re: [T2] Re:Gas Cap

Hi Dino

Silca, an Italian key blank manufacturer &amp; Europes largest, make key  
blanks for
your gas cap.  I'm not a work or I would get you the blank number as  
they make
that profile &amp; the reverse as well.  They are readily available here  
in Australia.


&gt; Hello Richard,
&gt; I was happy to see the cap picture (key).  Just like my 72 bus.   
&gt; The problem
&gt; is I only have 1 key left.  I keep it in the ash tray.  Last summer  
&gt; my 8 year
&gt; old took it out of the tray and I found it in the back of the bus.   
&gt; I almost
&gt; ran out of gas, thought I would have to ruin the cap. Anyways, I  
&gt; found it in
&gt; time.  Every time I see a new lock shop I stop in and try to get a  
&gt; key.  My key
&gt; is stamped 218. Do you have a key blank?  Or even one with the same  
&gt; number?
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Dino Spentzos
