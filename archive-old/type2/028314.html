Subject: NEW Toll-Free Number  1-866-BUS-DEPOT

Thanks to the new &lt; 866 &gt; toll-free exchange, we now have an
easier-to-remember toll-free number for orders:

1-866-BUS-DEPOT

Our existing toll-free number, 1-888-819-DEPOT will also continue to work,
but you may find this new one a bit easier to remember off the top of your
head.  (Just remember to use the new 866 area code, not 800, 888 or 877.)

A reminder that both toll-free numbers ring to the order desk, not to
customer service.  The operators at the order desk can ONLY TAKE ORDERS BY
PART NUMBER.  If you need part numbers lookups, or have questions about
parts or about an existing or prior order, please contact Customer Service
at 215-234-VWVW or sales_at_busdepot_dot_com , as nobody at the order desk is
trained to handle those questions.

At this time neither of the toll-free numbers will work from Canada, because
we have not been able to get an affordable rate for that service yet
(although we will keep trying!).

Thanks,
