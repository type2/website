Apparently they are unaware of the following:

- Mobil introduced Mobil 1 in 1976
- Porsche has approved the use of synthetic oil in its engines since 1980
- Porsche's have been &quot;factory filled&quot; with Mobil 1 since August 1992.
- Porsche 911's were air cooled until the 1998 model year

&gt; Just some food for thought on friday, feel free to pick apart their reasoning
&gt; (or mine if necesary).

I enjoy reading all those a magazines that support the hobby. Live long and
prosper!
