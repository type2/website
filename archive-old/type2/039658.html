Jeff,

John is right, I usually start mine the evening before if I am going on a
trip and plan to use it.  One suggestion I have from Nikki and David
Schwarze is that in RV stores they sell these tiny fans that really make a
difference!  by circulating air over the fins, they bring the temp down
quite a bit.

John is also correct on the 2-week (or more) capacity of the propane tank.
BUT... one problem that the original regulators (the rectangular ones)
have is that they age badly and often leak.  Get down there with your nose
and sniff for propane... if you smell anything, mix up a batch of leak
detector solution (dishwashing detergent and water) and brush it all over
that pup... any bubbles means replacement!  New regulators are not too
expensive (I kinda remember $30)  And this is a serious a safety issue as
gas lines!
