Subject: '75 FI jet question

Just brought home from Montana a '75 2.0L RSI pop-top camper.  A trip 
report will soon follow.

Today I got my first whiff of gas blowing through the vents thinking it 
was the &quot;old rotting hose&quot; syndrome passing through the vent lines into 
the overflow traps - wrong - it was a mis-seated FI jet or the 1.5&quot; 
fabic hose on the ring main.  It appears that the metal flange that the 
injector passes through that is bolted to the induction housing is 
rubbing the engine tin - pushing the jet slightly up and out of the 
induction housing.  

In the 400 plus miles from Libby, Montana to Bellevue, Washington I 
didn't smell a thing.  We had the heat blowing through the defroster the 
whole time.  Yet yesterday - take a whiff of Jiff - gas was puddling 
under the #2 jet on the tinware.

I tried lifting the bottom of the flange while tightning the nut to the 
induction housing - no change - it dropped down on to the tinware.  

Would there be any detriment to the flange if I filed it a tad to take 
the miniscule amount off the bottom that is rubbing?  Or, give the 
tinware a tap with the rounded end of a ballpeen hammer?  Is the 
injector flange supposed to rest on the tinware?

The one thing I did do to attempt a fix was to remove the 1.5&quot; of fabric 
hose from the ring main to the injector.  I also removed the jet from 
the flange and pushed the o-ring back into the flange then placed the 
jet back through and into the induction housing.  I clamped the new 
fabric hose on the jet and on the ring main and started it up.  It 
didn't leak but I'm still gun-shy seeing the flange scrating a small 
grove into the tinware.

Any thoughts?

Thanks
Danny
