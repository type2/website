When I had my 2110cc motor built the shop recommended that I add the 
cooler.  I have had zero problems and my bus doesn't act starved for oil 
nor does it over heat with it... Sorry you had such a bad experience TP, 
but sometime products just don't like working for certain people.
If Your engine is still stock... There is no reason for the additional oil 
cooler, the stock system works quite well.  And according to Gene Berg, 
will actually out perform any after market product, in this situation.  I 
actually do NOT recommend mounting the cooler under the bus.  They mounted 
mine where the Air Intake is on the side of the van.

Good Luck!

&gt; &gt;Hello,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  I purchased an after market bugpac or bugpack oil cooler with quite a few
&gt; &gt;connectors and a 11&quot; square nice coil that will mount under the bus. Has
&gt; &gt;anyone evr had experience with mounting and hooking up. Being there are no
&gt; &gt;directions...
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt;No experience with mounting and hooking up, just with dismounting and
&gt;unhooking
&gt;when replacing the motor that destroyed its self as it screamed, &quot;I don't like
&gt;this oil starvation any more!!!!!!&quot;
