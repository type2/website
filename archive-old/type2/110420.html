Subject: Re: [T2] Differences from vw pancake to Porsche 914 pancake

&lt;&lt;  I've found 
that 914 engines can cost more because they're from the Porsche side of 
things, and they're more rare since the market for them isn't as big as the 
Bus market is. &gt;&gt;

IIRC, the 914 was a VW/Porsche in Europe and badged as a Porsche in the
USA...When it first came over, there was a stink from the Porsche Owners
Groups about letting the car in...

&lt;&lt;  http://www.914-club_dot_de/  &gt;&gt;

Has a picture of the European logo of the car.

(BTW, aren't Acuras still Hondas in Europe?...Unless it's a Sterling, that 
is...)
