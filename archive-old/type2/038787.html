Our Camper has an ATK (VEGE)engine in it-remanufactured 1200 bucks.  First 
one we got blew a piston #3 (we did have some trouble but trouble brings 
experience and experience brings wisdom)but ATK replaced it a month later 
with another and we have not had any problems Since.  40 thousand miles and 
around the country.  Take it for what its worth.....

30 mph in second gear on a 18% GRADE  VERY STRONG ENGINE- VALVE ADJUSTMENT 
EVERY 1500 and oil change

PS:  In Search of a Jumpseat and tent for 71 camper.

Nothin left to do but smile, smile, smile!!
