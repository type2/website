Subject: Updated Restoration Page

I have updated the '64 21-window restoration to include some 
photos of the bus before restoration began and some progress 
photos.

Yes is WAS a lot of work (although Thom's barndoor makes this 
one look like it was in &quot;Good Condition&quot;).

Check it out at:
