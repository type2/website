This is the only question I feel qualified to answer... ;-)

If the pencil isn't held perfectly straight, it will get trapped. If
you're not careful, it will snap and leave a piece of itself in the
cylinder. Your paintbrush handle is a great idea - its size holds it
in the spark plug hole and helps keep it straight.

As for the fuel/oil soup... Keep in mind that there is only one place
that an otherwise healthy engine can put fuel in the oil. The
cylinders. It is either leaking past the rings or there's a hole in a
piston. One of these leaks will increase the level of liquid in your
sump by adding fuel and/or combustion particles. (And if your
compression is shot by one of the above leaks, there won't be much in
the way of combustion!)

I would do a compression check all around and see which cylinder is
allowing fuel into the oil.
