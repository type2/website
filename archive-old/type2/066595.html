Subject: balljoint rubbers

Dear All,

Mike recently enquired about the rubbers over the balljoints.
I too have the same problem and as Mike didnt have a specific
response about the rubbers, I wondered if anyone had any advice.

The rubber around one upper balljoint of my van is leaking grease.
I presume I need to replace this fairly quickly. Is it an easy job?
Should I replace all the rubbers while I am at it? Do I have to
replace the whole ball joint or take the torsion arm off?

Thankyou
