Subject: [T2] More newbie help...

Thanks to all who have replied to my earlier questions.

Now here is another.  After driving around for a day, I now have a film
of oil on the back of the bus.  I did not notice it smoking, but the oil
is coming from somewhere.
What do I need to look at now.  I took her by my VW mechanic and he said
he does not work on any busses newer than 1971, so I am back at square
one.  I have one other place to check before I bite the bullet and go to
the VW dealership.

Any ideas on what I am up against?

thanks,
