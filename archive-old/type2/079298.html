&gt; Hi all, 
&gt; So I'm having some painting frustrations. Never done body work before so
&gt; be gentle with me. The top coat is acting funny. It's sorta making
&gt; spider web-like patterns in some areas. These webs are slightly raised

&gt; difference is I'm using a white top color on top and a yellow on bottom.
&gt; Yes, I'm using cheap rattle can Rust-o-leum (no flames, please) but that
&gt; wouldn't explain why it's only happening in some places. 

I painted my bus from rattle cans and anyone who sees it can tell you
while it isn't factory new it is better than anyone would expect.

now I was almost forced to do this as it was my daily driver, so I did one
panel at a time. 

the difference was that I used high quality auto paint, same as used for
touch up work.

now have bright white over metalic blue 78 bus.  never like any of the
later stock colors .

so I suspect your problem has more to do with the &quot;cheap&quot; part of the
equation..._dot_use quality paint.....I used a Duplicolor paint if I recall.
