&lt;&lt; WHY did you gap them?  Was the purpose to hammer the seats or something??  
I curious about that... &gt;&gt;

Mike,

Not sure what you mean by &quot;to hammer the seats&quot;, it isn't mentioned in the 
recent research and work that Boston Engine Exchange has done on hydraulic 
lifters.

My intent is make sure the lifters are fully bled and pumped up before doing 
the final adjustment.

Here's the link, the article is in his tech section:

From what I have heard and read he is a very highly regarded engine rebuilder 
in bus and vanagon circles and has done a lot of research that has even 
appeared in Bentley updates.
