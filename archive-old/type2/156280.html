Subject: Re: [T2] Burned wires

zach the big wire that is melted looks to me to be the wire that runs between the alternator and the starter...? might not be but just what it looks like to me...?
   
  the little blue wire is either the oil light for your dash or the battery light.. might be something else... but i was thinking there is a blue and a black wire for battery and oil light?
  i dont know now since i had to replace my whole harness with other wireing ....(homemade wireing harness).... but i do know that the bentley has a accurate diagram in there of these wires.. cause i had to go by it when i did my harness...
  (do you have a bentley)? if not get one borrow one must need for things like this...
   
   
  maybe with the pictures zach one of the list gurus knows best whats up and can give you better help than i ever could ...
   
  good luck with that..
  wELL lets go finish the beetle engine and get it ready to install....
  have a grateful day
  peace 
  chai

  Okay,
Finally got the email problems worked out and just got the pictures in.
I re-examined the pictures and the wire in question is NOT the positive
battery lead which is supposed to lead to the starter.

here is the first pic

This is looking down into engine hatch. You can see the positive cable
just to the left of the other red wire which is leading into the voltage
regulator.

Sorry bout the angle. I didn't get the connection where this wire comes
into the harness that connects into the alternator, I am going to try and
get some better pictures tomorrow.

Anyone got any ideas?
