&gt; ...How much of a hassle it could become is probably dependent upon
&gt; whether or not someone is currently publishing reproductions, or plans

&gt; publishers are becoming extremely vigilant on this issue...

An interesting side note:  I have a Toro lawn mower.  A sticker on the
handle says &quot;Read owner's manual thoroughly.  Free replacement owner's
manuals are available from...etc.&quot;

Obviously, the goal of giving out free manuals is to head off
liability concerns.  Wouldn't the same logic apply to auto
manufacturers?  If one were to send VW a letter saying &quot;Please send me
a copy of the owner's manual so that I can operate my vehicle safely&quot;
it would be pretty hard for VW to refuse the request.

Frankly, I can't see VW getting all that upset about reproduction of
obsolete and out-of-print manuals as long as those participating in
the practice keep a low profile.  Dissemination of information that
supports the safe operation of existing vehicles is probably in VW's
best interest.

The business of VW jumping on every website with VW in its name is
probably due to a combination of corporate suspicion of anything
associated with the internet and the relative ease of searching for
&quot;VW&quot; and variations thereof.  There are people out there who make
their livings by seaching the net for references to companies, people,
etc. and reporting their results to clients.  Some corporate suit got
a burr under his saddle and spread some grief because it was easy to
do so.

I would be extremely surprised to see VW going after an individual
making one copy of an obsolete manual for private use.  VW would have
nothing to gain by this, as they are already publicly defending their
trademark and copyright in other cases.

Now, if you were to force the issue by telling VW that you were
reproducing manuals, you would force VW to defend their copyright.

It boils down to an unofficial &quot;Don't ask, don't tell&quot; policy!
