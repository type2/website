&gt;So we get there and lo and behold we see in the distance, behind the
&gt;three-wheeled corrola and a real ugly corvette, the blue bus, the chariot of
&gt;hemp, the stygian transporter I now call Sam, or sometimes Sammy.  I tell you,
&gt;many moons were spent getting the reek out of this one, friends.  I haven't
&gt;cut into the ceiling for little baggies yet.&lt;

You aren't planning any trips to Canada, are you? ;-)
