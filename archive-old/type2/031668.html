&gt; Turn it in (clockwise) until you see an increase or stablization of

not only almost in but only when fully seated do I see any real
improvement....I also plugged most of the vacuum lines to see if that
indicated a leak, no change at any point, so I started futzing with the
air mixture screw (on the AFM) finally got it running reasonably well but
still not spot on.

  I still have the small exhaust leak, finally got the part I need so will
get on that...hopefully this will help

any other suggestions on getting the air mixture any richer as I am sure
it is not right.

thanks

&gt; &gt;yeah I realized you had it reversed, the big question,  any suggestions as
&gt; &gt;to how far in to turn the AFM adjusting screw???
&gt; &gt;   I know I would need to check exhausts etc to get it right on but any
&gt; &gt;ballpark ideas to get started??
