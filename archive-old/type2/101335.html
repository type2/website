Subject: Jalousie window overhaul kits?

Check out  http://www.wolfsburgwest_dot_com/  I bought a seal kit from them.
Haven't installed it yet, but it looks like good quality.  It's also the
original grey rubber.

hope this helps,

Does someone make Jalousie window overhaul kits? My windows need new seals
and the widows flutter at highway speeds. The looseness in the mechanism
seems to be coming from the gearbox. Can I get a replacement gearbox? I see
that it appears to be permanently riveted in.
