Subject: '62 clutch weirdness

And the MOT Saga [sic] continues, each installment more thrilling
than the next...

My clutch never behaved itself since I bought my bus. The cable
was on max, but it felt like it wasn't disengaging fully. So I put a
new cable in there, but still had to wind it up to max adjustment. It 
was a big improvement, but I still had to floor the pedal for a smooth
shift.

Since I had the engine out last weekend I decided to put a new 
clutch plate (friction plate) in there, see if that improved things.

Well, this evening after getting the brake lights to work (a frayed
wire up front), I tried moving the bus out of the garage. With the
engine was running, I could only shift into reverse, and then with
a horrible noise. I lifted my clutch-foot and rolled back. When I
pushed the pedal down it disengaged OK (i.e. I stopped moving).
Equally, if I put it in gear *before* starting the engine, everything
was OK, although it's not too happy about coming out of gear
with the engine running.

My guess: either
a) I've got the wrong cable
b) The pressure plate is worn (I don't fully understand the latter -
this is a hypothesis of my boyfriend's)

BUT  I am mystified and stupified at why everything is *worse* with the
new clutch plate than with the old (which, incidentally, wasn't worn
much).

AAAGGHHH. Help?

Some good things:
My new VW nosebadge turned up today from a kind man in the
Split Screen Van Club. Very nice condition, bare metal, only fifteen
quid.
Some kids have written 'We Love Sarah' on the wall near my garage.
Well, ain't that nice? (side-note - probably the same little bastards
who took my original nosebadge :-)
