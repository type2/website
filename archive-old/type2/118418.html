Subject: Re: [T2] locking gas cap

Autozone had one listed one on their website for my 70 bus. I went to the
store and they had the same listing, so I bought it. It was a waste of time,
it wasn't even close.
Someone said a VW Thing locking gas cap is the same as the early bays. They
can be had but are expensive.  I am assuming your 71 is the same as my 70,
with a huge hole there for the filler.

I would like to buy a locking gas cap for my 1971 westy. I`ve asked around
at my local volkswagen part shops ,But nobody knows if they are avaliable.
 Any suggestions will be appreciated

Thank You Very Much
