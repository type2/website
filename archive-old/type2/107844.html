Subject: RE: [T2] Sound proofing - was '68 wheel locked up

I was doing public relations work for Lydall corporation which has a website
at www.CoolandQuiet_dot_com and they sell sound and head deadening materials.
The same stuff that the major car manufacturers use, not the crappy stuff in
the JC Whitney Catalogue. Not sure if they're still doing consumer sales but
if they are, the stuff is really good.
