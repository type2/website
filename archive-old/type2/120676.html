Subject: aircooled_dot_net promo code?

Hey volks,
I'm about to order a SVDA w/ compufire ignotion from aircooled_dot_net and
was wondering if the list had a promo code (like at BusDepot). The list
has had lots of positive things to say about the performance of the
SVDA's. Any &quot;gotcha's&quot; I need to look out for during install? I'm
replacing a 009 into a type4 motor with a Weber progressive carb.
Buh-bye flat spot :)
Thanks!
