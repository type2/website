Subject: tranny trouble

Greetings fellow listees!
I will try to be brief. Please bear with me as I really need guidance on this.
I recently purchased a 78 westy with only 125,000 mi on it. I am sure of the 
mileage, as the PO kept excellent maintenance records.
When I bought it, there was alot of play in the clutch before it engaged. I 
tightened it up, but may have made it too tight, I'm not sure. When the 
clutch pedal is depressed, I was getting a growling noise in first and second 
gear. I checked the tranny oil, and it was low. I filled it, and this didn't 
fix the growling. I loosened the cable a little, and this didn't help. Still 
growling. BTW, when the clutch pedal is let out, the growling went away. 
After about two weeks of this, I was going around a curve in third gear, and 
it started to slip, the engine revved high. This happened twice. Then several 
days later, I was driving to work and I heard a pop-bang, and the clutch 
would not work. Thanks to Muir who taught me how to 'synchro' shift with out 
the clutch, I got to work, checked the clutch cable and found it intact. 
My question is this: Is it something cheap and simple to fix like clutch 
plate or throwout bearing? If the clutch is bad, will there be a little 
slipping in third? 
Or do I need a new transmission? If I need a new tranny, I will be buying an 
aftermarket, or something like that. I dont want a cheesy rebuilt, or 
scrapyard tranny. Hence the importance of this question. A good tranny from 
Bow Wow Auto parts would cost about 850 dollars!
Please help!
Sorry about the length of the message!
Faithful listee follower!
