&gt; i'm going to be replacing both the left cv boots today.  do i do these

&gt; guessing i use the entire tube that came with the kit?

Remove the entire axle, take off whichever CV comes off the easiest, and
replace both CV boots from that end.  Wipe out the CVs with many paper
towels until you get as much of the old grease out as possible, then
regrease carefully with the grease that comes with the kit.  Put any
excess grease in the boot.  Don't tilt the CVs too much or you get to play
the reassembly puzzle.

You definitely want a disposable work surface (cardboard box, for example)
and several pairs of latex gloves.  It's a messy job!
