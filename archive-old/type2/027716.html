I feel a liitle better to see someone else sees this as plausible. Last 
week,in doing a simple tune on SO's KG (could happen on a bus, I think), I 
grounded the end of wrench on the battery..and did a credible arc welding 
job on the plug that I had almost out :(. Insert repair of the head didn't 
work (The PACKAGED kit had the tap 1MM too big for the insert required, I 
find out after the failed attempt and engine drop! Quess you gotta' mike 
everything you touch)

The unfortunate part is, I've ruined a 1600 SP head that was almost new, and 
they're hard to come by, Karl tells me. Moral: don't be stupid, as I was..go 
to school. I mean...weird things can happen.
