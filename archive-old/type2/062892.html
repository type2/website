Subject: Re: What's the deal with naval jelly???

&gt;I believe that naval jelly is some kind of acid  (oxalic???) it causs a
&gt;chemical reaction that converts the ferrous oxide into ferric oxide, this is
&gt;nert. You must have a rusty surface for it to work and as long as the
&gt;reaction goes down to the bare metal you will have no problems.

Naval Jelly contains phosphoric acid, the same acid used in Coca Cola. 
Coke is probably cheaper, and I expect the syrup has a concentration 
pretty close to Naval Jelly.
