&gt;SENSITIVE, FLAME HAPPY, UNDER THE AGE OF CONSENT, OR RESIDE IN
&gt;A STATE WHICH CONSIDERS SUCH FORMS OF HUMOR OFFENSIVE, PLEASE

&gt;Kath:
&gt;
&gt;NOW JUST WAIT A MINUTE HERE!  My entire view of
&gt;the wonderous state of California comes from reading 
&gt;Hot Tits and Engines....er...Hot VWs.  My impression
&gt;is that your state is populated by plastic blonds with
&gt;legs up to here, wearing tiny string what-em-a-call-its
&gt;and white high-heel shoes.  They spend most, if not all,
&gt;of their time leaning back against shiny VWs, or sitting
&gt;behind the wheel of same, flashing cleavage.  Even though
&gt;my bus is not yet repainted (just mechanically restored
&gt;and the interior completely redone) I am convinced that it will
&gt;also attract these silicon babes better than a shopping mall.
&gt;
&gt;I've been busting my ass for the past month getting my bus ready
&gt;to drive to California--but now YOU are challenging my worldview! : {
&gt;
&gt;I don't know if I can handle this.
&gt;
&gt; .....be on the road in no time. (but now I don't know if I want to)

Rick, you're killin' me!

Have you ever thought of going into writing for a living?

Thanks for your reply!
