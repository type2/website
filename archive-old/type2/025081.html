Well I changed the carb. and it idles perfect.  It runs quite well.
Although... more problems.
After finally getting it running  and fusin'with it in the drive way I noticed
a good size puddle of nothing other that OIL.
Also if I tried to move it the car jumped when letting out the clutch.
After looking for the source of oil I determined it was the rear main seal.
SO, I brought the motor down got a new clutch disc and rear main seal.  
Intalled them, but it's still leaks a little bit, like when I drive it and
then park it I would say I get a puddle about 5 inches wide... that is more
oil than I would understand a VW leaking.  I looked at it again and it seams
like it's still coming from the rear main seal(or from between the motor and
trans.)
Well my question now is why would it still leak from the rear main seal even
if I changed it?
The clutch works fine now, but won't it make the car jump again once it gets a
lot of oil on it again?

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Joe

&gt;I found a motor that had not been running for a while.  Cleaned the carb, 
&gt;filed and gapped points, changed dist. cap and rotor, plugs, wires and 
&gt;adjusted the valves.  When I installed it I got it to run by choking 
&gt;it(by putting my hand over the carb).  It ran for a few seconds, say... 
&gt;5-10 secs. and died. 
&gt;Even if I try to accelerate it it dies.  
&gt;But if when it's going to die, I choke it again... it will run for 
&gt;another 5-10 seconds and dies.  In conclusion the only way I can get it 
&gt;to try to run is by choking it over and over.
&gt;I checked that the fuel pump is pumping... which it is.
&gt;
&gt;Any ideas on what I might check?
&gt;Could the coil do this?
&gt;Any help is greatly appreciated,
&gt;
&gt;Thank You,
&gt;
&gt;Joe
