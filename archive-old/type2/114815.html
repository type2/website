Subject: Inerior design

Has anyone bought products from Sew Fine Products (www.sewfineproducts_dot_com)?
They have a great selection but, the seem kind of pricey. Are there any
other alternatives out there? How easy is it to fab my own door trim pieces?
Also, are there any places that offer carpet kits at a cheaper price?

Thanks Volks,
Scott
