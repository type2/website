Subject: Tire fart for Don

The problem is that there are no 205/70/14 in the
proper load rating for quite some time.  Do your
tires have reinforced sidewalls, a load range C
or D rating, and a max pressure of 50+?  Michelin
used to make some that were factory for vanagons
with alloys, but I'm not aware of any current
options.  

&gt;I got them because that size was MUCH cheaper in
the higher load ranges than a 185R14.

You get what you pay for, Don.  Run passenger
tires if you want.   You're still real new to the
VW game, I know.  I ran passenger tires also...
until I got tired of changing lanes when the wind
blew.  The difference is drastic. 

VW engineers knew what they were talking about.
