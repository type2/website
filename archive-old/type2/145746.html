Subject: rappin, buckin, barely runnin

So I'll try to make this short and sweet.  I mean sour!  =(
   
  1978 Volkswagen Transporter/Campmobile.  Prior to trip (of 40 miles), no rapping, no nothing, purring like a kitten.  Compression 90, 130, 130, 135 (not great with the 90 there, but figure she's still got some life in 'er).  This engine has approx 13,000 miles on it, was a crate exchange from a company in CA.  
   
  Heading to the destination, 30 miles or so, starts making a rapping sound, temp at approx 90 deg c (oil dipstick sensor).  Plenty of oil pressure.  Some power loss and bucking.  Thought it was a fuel problem  the bucking  still not resolved.  If I plant the accelerator/quickly open the throttle, no increase in RPM; if I slowly open the throttle, RPMs gradually come up.  Replaced the fuel filter, problem remains.
   
  Return trip, still rapping, bucking, left anyway, rapping got worse, backfiring started, throughfiring, major power loss, until it stopped running and will now start but not remain started.  Had it towed to the house, where it sits awaiting repair.
   
  Rapping sounds like something more central to the motor than valvetrain.  No loose/sloppy rocker arms, all valves seem to be moving properly when the engine is running.  All valves adjusted a few months ago. Timing is right.  No loose vacuum lines near as I can tell.
   
  Engine is a 2000 cc FI, hydraulic valves.
   
  Any thoughts?  I am praying for a miracle
