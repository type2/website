Subject: The Lurker and the Stutterer

        You'll never get me!  I am the shadow!  The rustle of leaves just 
behind you!  The silent minority! The... guy who has a little blue bus 
that is stuttering a bit and needs a bit of help?  
        Yes, I have come clean, a lurker no longer.  My name is Michael 
Hoefer and I am proud owner of a '75 afc-injected transporter, which 
actually is powered by a '76 2000cc POWERHOUSE.  Yep.  First, a bit of a 
tale.
        My friend had a bus which I had an integral part in blowing up.  
Anyway, we were searching through ads and heard about a bus in a junkyard 
in Redwood City.  I figured, hey, maybe some parts, eh?  So we get there 
and lo and behold we see in the distance, behind the three-wheeled corrola 
and a real ugly corvette, the blue bus, the chariot of hemp, the stygian 
transporter I now call Sam, or sometimes Sammy.  I tell you, many moons 
were spent getting the reek out of this one, friends.  I haven't cut into 
the ceiling for little baggies yet.  don't think I will.   Then to make a 
long story short we met an amazing guy named Roy Clouse at a vee-dub show 
in san Jose and he unloaded a '76 running block on us for fifty bucks.  
And oh, does it run.  He is just one of those guys who is content and 
wasn't looking to make any money off anyone, rather, he saw a couple of 
guys in need and basically gave them a running engine, even dropped it off 
at our place twenty minutes away from his home.  
     
        There's a brief introduction, and I'm sorry to bore anyone.  The 
engine sounds good, only problem I can sense is a bit of STUTTERING in the 
power when accelerating.  Nothing too bad, but you can definitely notice 
it.  Could this be:
        a)  Old clutch?  I didn't replace the clutch plate before.  
(should have)
     
        b)  Dirty injectors?  
     
        Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Adieu,
