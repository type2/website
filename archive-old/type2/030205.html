&gt; Hello All  The best way to remove a gen. is to remove the big nut on the fan 
&gt; while it is still in the fanhousing. To do this remove the front half of the 
&gt; pulley and use a wrench on the remaining half of the pulley to turn the nut 
&gt; off the back of the fan,which you dog down with a breaker bar and 36mm 
&gt; scocket. This leaves the fan still inside the housing and doesn't require 
&gt; lifting the housing at all from the other tin work.  Mark Dearing Salem

This is a good idea, and I'll try it if I'm ever foolish enough to remove
the alternator with the engine in place again!

One caution is that you need to be careful to keep track of the washers
and shims on both sides of the fan.  If you drop one of these into the
shroud it will be a heck of a job getting it out!  Still, with care it
would be a lot less disruptive than lifting the shroud.
