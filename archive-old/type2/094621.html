Subject: Update - AIRS request for Susan Dolvin...

------=_NextPart_001_0003_01C24F04.32EA6200

Hi everyone,

On Wednesday friends posted a AIRS request for anyone in the Nebraska are=
a to &quot;backup&quot; Susan Dolvin if she needed assistance.  Susan is touring th=
e old Oregon trail and various pioneer landmarks as she proceeds from the=
 coast of Oregon eastward to the BNNTA event this coming weekend.  She le=
ft Oregon with an &quot;iffy&quot; alternator, and sure enough, after a few days it=
 apparently stopped charging all together.  She's in a well-worn '78 West=
y with a dual battery system, so she gets both of her batteries charged b=
efore her driving day starts, and seems to be enjoying her drive using th=
e power off the batteries while touring eastward.  Obviously she drives d=
uring the day and turns off all accessories.  =20

We have secured a remanufactured Bosch alternator for her here in St. Lou=
is and will do the repairs, and an oil change to boot, after the event is=
 over.  As of 6pm Wednesday evening, she had already bought a charger in =
Kansas and was overnighting near Independence, MO.  All seems to be going=
 well for her, and after some sightseeing on Thursday morning at historic=
 sites in Independence, she plans to hop onto I-70 with her fully charged=
 batteries and cruise on over to stay with us here in St. Charles, MO.  W=
e'll welcome her with open arms, run her a hot bath and ice down the brew=
s!  Those of you attending BNNTA will get to meet this intrepid adventure=
r and noted Westfalia and Dormobile expert.  She's quite a &quot;gal&quot;!

Again, so far, so good for Susan!  Thanks to all of you for your concern =
and offers of assistance.  It looks like she'll be cruising into my shop =
under her own power, just the way she'd like to...

Lookin' forward to seeing Susan, and some of you all very soon...

p.s.  If anyone coming to BNNTA has any extra alternator brackets, bolts =
and hardware, especially a correct alternator pulley for a '78 Type 2 Bus=
, could you throw it in your Bus &quot;just in case&quot; we need to locate any of =
those parts to complete her repair.  I'm told she may have a Toyota, Dats=
un, Motorola or some other brand alternator in there, so who knows what h=
ardware and pieces we'll need to get the correct Bosch alternator back in=
 there.  Thanks for any assistance on her behalf!
