Subject: 1968 through 1971 Type 2 rear engine support bar.
Date: Tue, 2 Jan 2001 03:55:53 -0800

Has anyone ever put together a modified early Baywindow rear engine support
bar that would accommodate the oil filter/pump setup installed on new
Mexican VW 1600 engines with hydraulic lifters?

All things considered, it seems like this is a niche just waiting to be
filled.

I'm aware of approaches/strategies that eliminate/relocate the oil filter so
a stock &quot;mustache bar&quot; will work, but it seems to me the simplest approach
would be to re-engineer/re-fabricate the support bar.

If folks can fabricate a whole bunch of bits and pieces to install a Porsche
911 six in a Bay bus, just modifying a rear support bar ought to be a piece
of cake.

FWIW.....
