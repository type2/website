It's been pointed out that:

&lt;Putting a &quot;T&quot; in the line would negate this function, as the fuel
would simply circulate.&gt;

Well the heat sink bit is true...but I used to convert 72-24 buses to Bosch
EFI-D  from a 70-73 411-412(The best unit was the 71 411 &quot;W&quot; series 1.7)..I
tried using the single outlet tank...it would be impossible to get the air out
of the lines....what air? you say...HA! The early tanks don't have the extra
baffle around the fuel pick up..turn the corner with 1/4 tank or
less....&quot;Brrrrrrzzzaap&quot;
the pump sucks air....and just keeps cycling the bubbles...
My *own* 72, I pulled the tank panel (don't forget the two screws under the
car!) and spliced the return into the right vent line...worked great! *AND* I
found that the vent hoses were all perished and needed replacing anyway...
For customers cars I'd put in the FI tank...it is possible (barely) to remove
the tank with the engine in the car. pull all the carb stuff off 1st..and Umm,
did I tell you not to forget the two screws under the car??? Not that *I* ever
did ;-)
