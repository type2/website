OOPS! Silly me! Maybe your old rotor can be turned. For some reason this did
not occure to me. It would probably only cost about $40-50 to have a shop do
it IF it can be done, sometimes they are just too thin to machine so you
should be preparred

&gt; after inspection i noticed that the pad is rubbing the disc every half
&gt; turn.
&gt; it does stop when i brake. there is no roar
&gt; like described, so, it shouldn't be the bearing, but i am having it
&gt; checked out by a trusted VW mechanic on monday, so we'll see what
&gt; happens. any advice on how i can seperate the pad, and save some money
&gt; would be greatly appreciated.
&gt; thanx for the responses-
