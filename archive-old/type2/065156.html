Subject: Head lights brightening?

When I drive at night I notice my head lights occationally get brighter and
then return to normal.  They don't seem to do this at any particular time.
I immediately think it must be the voltage regulator but is there any thing
else is could be.  I also notice it with the interior light so it isn't just
the head lights.  By the way, where exactly is the voltage regulator on a
'77 bus?
thanks,
brett
