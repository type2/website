&gt; I originally thought that it took whatever the altergator/generator was

&gt; 
&gt; That doesn't appear to be the case.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm reading about 13.3v up front when the engine is running.
&gt; 
&gt; Are things like car radios and other accessories able to handle variable

Hello Markus.

Without a regulator, the voltage output from a generator will continue
to climb until the unit burns up :&gt;(  The regulator keeps the voltage at
*around* 13.5 to 14 volts. It must do this to put *juice* back into the
battery.

If you are getting 13.3V, your OK.

Yes, radios and stuff can handle this change.:&gt;)

Have Fun.

Douglas
