Now that we have a new baby (www.monad_dot_net/~sjtickner) we are very concious 
Sorry, wrong URL. It's actually top.monad_dot_net/~sjtickner.
Also, I did more research on the list last night and read all the way through the replacing fuel lines posting. Down near the bottom they talk about replacing the filler hose and they reveal something I didn't know, there are two rubber sections on the filler neck. I only replaced one and it needed it bad. So I'm hoping with some gymnastics I can replace the other one as well. That should fix it so we can go to Winterhawk w/o any problems. Thanks
