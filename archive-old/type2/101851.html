&gt; Hi List,
&gt;
&gt; What's the best way to cap the vac line coming off manifold on a 1600dp
&gt; from a  a 71  with brake servo?  I'm popping the motor into a 65 that
&gt; doesn't need that vac line.  Thanks,

Swap the manifold center section with a bug center section.  Save the '71
center section for someone who needs it!
