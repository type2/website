Subject: Notes from the Service Bulletins....

I recently acquired the Service Bulletin Updates to the VW factory manuals
for the years 68-70 for Type I, II, and III. This book is 8 1/2&quot; by 7&quot; by 6&quot;
thick.. Cover's VW booboo's..

Any way, the metal bent  pipe, that everyone throws away, from the
distributor to the vacuum pot on the dizzy, is put there to prevent gasoline
&gt;from running from the carburetor and damaging the diaphragm in the vacuum
unit. It is bent to arch up from the carb and then down to the distributor.

I don't know if this makes a difference in the grand scheme of things, just
found it interesting. TBear (try pulling your hose from the carb end and
seeing if it is wet with gas, mine was)

Don't take life too seriously- you'll never live through it.
