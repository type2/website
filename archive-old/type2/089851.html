Subject: Re: [T2] vent thingy under rear seat

Wtih the rush of answers went back and crawled back under the westy.
All of the heated air lines come to a junction at the gas booster  
heater and go through it.  but that one line is a stranger.  After 
looking at the answer below it makes sense.  Because of the angle air 
would actually be getting sucked back into the flow and mixing with the 
new air from the fan.  Still seems a strange place to put it though.
thanks everyone

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; It's probably the air intake for the heater. It's much more efficient to
&gt; re-heat warm air from inside the vehicle than to suck up cold air from
&gt; outside.

&gt; Happy trails,
