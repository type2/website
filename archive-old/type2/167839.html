&gt;&gt;  build it to Ethanol standards

	I haven't the exact numbers in front of me, and they vary 
slightly with T, but I think you'll find there's no such thing as E50 
-  once you try to dissolve more than c.15% EtOH in petrol, it will 
not form a single-phase solution.
	Then when you get up around E85 it becomes again possible to 
make a single-phase liquid.  E90 is an attractive fuel, according to 
the U of Canterbury team who researched it (mainly on Dr John Peet's 
Mini with readily changeable jets in a Solex); the vapour in the tank 
is not explosive.
	The Brazilians are of course the experts on hi-EtOH fuels, 
including VW T2 with CR c.16:1 (like the old J.A.P 500cc single on 
E100 which ruled speedway till suddenly eclipsed by Jawa).

&gt;
&gt;Those will give you problems.  They need different jetting and may attack
&gt;components, even metal ones.  Exactly which components they will attack is
&gt;not obvious, you just have to keep an eye out for deterioration or
&gt;corrosion.

	right on Teach
	methanol/petrol solns are even worse
