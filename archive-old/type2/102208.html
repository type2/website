Subject: RE: [T2] Transmission Bell Housing

On 1979's the bell housing bolts to the bus and that is what holds the
tranny in.  If you support the weight with a chain then the answer is yes.
But the axels, the two bolts on top, the clutch cable and tube, 2 backup
light wires, the shift coupler, and the 2 front carrier bolts is all that is
holding it in now anyways.  I would pull the thing so you can have more room
to work.  It is only half hour more work and it is easier to workout side.
