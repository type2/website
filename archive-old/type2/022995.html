&gt;While cruising on a level road at a normal speed yesterday, I heard a
&gt;pop and then the tenor of the engine noise changed - it became more
&gt;ragged. Now, especially when decelerating or going down hill while
&gt;engine braking, I hear what seem like a series of mini-backfires. Also
&gt;the engine is now running hot, so much so that when holding your hand
&gt;over the heat vent it becomes almost painful.

A compression check would be a logical first step in such situations.
