Subject: RE: [T2] Parts engine

	Thanx fellas for the useful warnings about various fuel pumps.
	But may I, from a motorcyclist perspective, point out that 
there's no obvious need for any fuel pump at all on a T2?  Is the 
fuel tank at a handy altitude wrt the carb?  If so, why not simply 
rely on that most reliable, free force *gravity* to run the petrol 
down into the float chamber?  This has always been normal practice in 
sickles  -  the tank is ca.0.5' above the carb, so you just turn on 
the tap and away you go  ...
	Pressure at the carb would be approx. 14 psi x (0.5'/30') x 
0.8  -  which suffices for 100mpg or even 40mpg consumption, so could 
the T2 tank have 'the drop on' the carb enough   ...  ?
	Or could it be that only the twin-carb versions have the tank 
far enough above the float chambers?
