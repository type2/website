Subject: Jet Sizes??


&gt;&gt;I have a couple of spare 34-pic3 carbs  which I will rebuild into one good
&gt;spare.  Is there any way to identify what the stock jet should be as I
don't
&gt;know what I will find in the way of jets
Dale:
Just about any 34PICT3 will have either a 125 or 127.5 main jet, depending
on original application.  I don't know if there is an easy way to tell.
That's OK with stock Type 1 motor and exhaust, stock dizzy.  I don't think
it's likely you will find any other size in there.  Good luck
