&gt; I was given a 1966 Corvair, the body needs a lot of work, but the engine

The corvair turns the wrong way for the VW transmission.  You have to
install a special camshaft to allow the corvair to turn the right way.

Most corvair installations I've seen also include the corvair
transmission, often the 2-speed powerglide automatic.
