&gt; &gt; I have been running MXT without any problem for years.
&gt; I didn't have any problems with the Michelins I was using on my utility

&gt; I've heard of others having problems with sudden tread peeling on
&gt; Michelins too.
&gt; 
&gt; Considering the fragility of my VW fender wells, I won't be running
&gt; Michelin tires any time soon.

I have been running Michelins exclusively on all my cars including 20+
VW's over 30 years and the only time I had a tread peel was when I had
passenger car tires on a bus, and they lasted 45,000 miles or so...didn't
realize they were the wrong rating until they peeled, real quick changed
all 3left to correct rating and have had no problems, (not counting
hitting a half cinder block that fell off a truck on the interstate)
