Subject: Hey, there's a bug engine in my '71 bus!

This weekend I made a weird discovery while changeing the clutch in my
'71 pop-top. I've had the bus for almost two years, but this is the
first time I've had the engine out. Anyways, I pull off the rear bumper
and apron and realize there's something funny about the engine, and
about the reat engine hanger. It turns out that one of its previous
owners modifed the hanger so that it could fit onto a standard bug
engine. Normally, the bus engine has a slightly different crankcase,
with a few extra drillings to allow the hanger to bolt on. However, in
my bus only the ends of the hanger are left. In between them is welded
some home-grown metal work that appears to grab the engine somewhere
behind the main pulley.

Has anyone ever heard of this modification before? I don't think it's
given me any problems, but it seems that the engineers at VW would have
used a bug engine if they could in the first place.
