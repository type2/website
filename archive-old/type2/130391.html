&gt;I just finished doing a compression test on the engine in question, here are 
&gt;the results:
&gt;
&gt;Cyl. #     I      II      III       IV
&gt;
&gt;Test1   94     143   122     125
&gt;Test2   90     144   117     121
&gt;Test3   91     145   115     120
&gt;Test4   92     145   116     119

II is high, III and IV look normal for age, and I is heading south for rebuild country.

&gt;Now I know that they all should be over 100 PSI and within 15% of each 
&gt;other. Is that 15% of the average of all of them?

15% is so the engine remains in a better state of balance. You are looking at 15% difference between the highest and lowest readings to minimize bottom end wear (as much as you can with an unbalanced VW engine). You've got 38% but you'll recover if you can fix #1.

&gt;Am I just looking at this wrong? If this is correct then I guess I better 
&gt;start planning the tear down and rebuild. Any suggestions or comments?

Buses with worse results are still driving down the road but you've got a head replacement in your future.
