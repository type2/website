&gt; Has anyone had any luck taking their bus to a local shop / chain store to

Probably because it is a time consuming job.  It isn't particularly
difficult, but you have to be able to follow the Bentley instructions to
get the desired results.

I wouldn't trust this job to a random mechanic.  It should be duck soup
for a competent aircooled VW mechanic, though. 

&gt; Also, what shocks work well on loaf Westy's, anything in particular?

Nothing will make it corner like a Ferrari, but some of the suppliers on
the list can fix you up with OE Boge shocks.
