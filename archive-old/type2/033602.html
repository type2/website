&gt;Hi all...Need help...' 81 Vanagon...Emissions...&lt;
Lets see now...' 81 Vanagon, oh yea, that came stock with a bored and stroked
American Motors 401...yea, thats the ticket...Vanagon. 1981. 2.l eng. Bosch
AFC fuel injection. Time to check the bi-focals, Doc.

and

&gt;Lisa,
&gt;Now that we kicked Dr. Tim around it's time for the list to get helpful.


Why are comments like these necessary??!  If you don't like Dr. Tim's
attitude ( and he can be overbearing), IGNORE IT.
He wasn't insulting, he wasn't cruel or nasty; he just pointed out that it
would help if we knew WHAT was IN the poster's bus... as I recall, what VW
put in isn't always what stayed there. If you think he WAS nasty in a post,
perhaps writing him pmail, or a 'sorry, we're not all like that' to the
original postee should do.

Sh*t like this is NOT placing yerself on a higher plane.........
