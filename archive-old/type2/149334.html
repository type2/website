&gt; cliff - straight up, i think wcm stinks up and down the block. low

&gt; glass and rubber, so i am breaking out the NOS gaskets.

No doubt WCM fit is lousy but...

&gt; moral of the story is to get on german ebay, learn a little german,  
&gt; and call it good. with one bid on [snip] bought 3 nos windshield  
&gt; gaskets

Why are you bothering with NOS windshield gaskets when OEVeedub sells  
new German rubber:

I fit one of them to my bus almost 3 years ago and the fit was  
incredible. Quote from their website:

&quot;Our OEM seals are made in the original Volkswagen moldings in  
Germany and the compounds used are the most modern EPDM supplied by  
the Metzler company -- this ensures the seals are not only the  
correct shape, they are made better and will last longer than the  
original! Here you'll find body seals, door seals, window seals and a  
large assortment of interior, chassis and rubber pieces for your VW  
bus. (We do not sell old, brittle NOS seals.)&quot;
