Subject: Bug Sighting on TV

This morning they were showing the movie &quot;Footloos(I think) and I just 
caught a part of it where this kid drives a yellow bug with stripes into 
the school parking lot and everyone is laughing at him.  Later, he cums 
up with the famer type kid (like Jethro) and they actuallfilm him from 
the back seat, starting up the bug, putting on some tunes, and taing off 
and you can hear the engine running.  It was neat.  He then gets pulled 
over by the cops for having too loud of music of music playing.  Seems 
like this kid was trapped in a Bible belt town or something....
