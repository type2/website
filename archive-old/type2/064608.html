The categories  are fairly specific.  Category one has ceased to be a car and
has become a work of art.  it is not driven and can be expected to win top
honors in any show.
Category two may be driven but is almost as good as one...Like new with minimal
signs of wear.  Most cars in carshows are category three..they look good from
twenty feet but on close inspection show some wear. Every thing works on a
category three.. Category four is a driver...shows signs of wear from twenty
feet out.  Needs little or no work to be functional.  Category five may or may
not be running but isn't weathered, wrecked, rusted, or stripped of parts.
While presenting a real challenge to the restorer it won't have him chasing all
over the place for parts.  And finally._dot_category six  the car we are all driving
around...The parts car.
