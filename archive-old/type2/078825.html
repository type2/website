Subject: Dual vac adv dizzy question

Hello all, my 72 westy has the dreaded 009 dizzy that I 
intend to replace with a rebuilt stocker when funds 
allow. Until that time I figure I may as well reinstall 
the stock dizzy that I still have. I know that the shaft 
is slightly worn, but I seem to remember that it was 
running fairly ok(amd certainly not any worse) with said 
original dizzy. I bought the 009 on the advice of a 
parts counter guy (yes I have come to realize that isn't 
the most cost effective method of diagnosing problems). 
Should I just leave well enough alone until I get a 
rebuilt stock dizzy?
The second part of my question concerns the vaccum 
lines. Mine has dellorto frd34 carbs. The po had one 
vaccum line connected to the left hand carb and the 
other was teed into the intake manifold where the brake 
booster is connected. Is it OK to have vaccum advance 
and brake booster running off of the same port (I would 
think the two would compete for vaccum)? Can I use the 
vaccum port on the right hand carb?
Okay one last question: Would it be a bad thing to not 
have the vaccum reatrd hooked up? What if I just capped 
it off?
Thanks, 
Mike
