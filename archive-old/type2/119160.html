right. Keep a sharp look out, The first dirt Rd. on the right will be

your turn. This is dirt Road #900. You'll see a message board on your

left after you turn, just keep goin' straight. You'll pass three dirt

roads going to the left that are closed off with gates. When you come to

Rd. #913, cut back up to the left and go up the hill. You'll go up a

hill, then down a hill, then up a hill again. When you get to the top of

the hill, they'll be a steep incline to your right. Go up the incline

and your ready to pick your campin' spot.
