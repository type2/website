Subject: It's GREAT to be back!

I used to be on the vanagon list about a year and a half ago and am acstatic
to find that the list has split into two and be back on.  I have a '63 kombi
that I rescued from certain destruction from a junkyard.  It's in my garage
and has yet to be driven by me, but should be on the road soon.  There are a
few hurdles I still have to cross, but hopefully I can get it done in the
next few months.  Anyway, just wanted to say hi and let everyone know who I
am and what kind of bus I have.
