maybe i should have put &quot;hello Westfakia&quot; in the subject line for this one.
i just want to &quot;publicly&quot; thanks chris for well-done deal. as he said 
earlier, i called him wed. afternoon &amp; asked if i could pick it up that very
evening.  by the time i made it to greensboro from raleigh he had the
interior cleaned up nicely &amp; all the paperwork was ready to go. so now i
finally have a bus of my very own.

made the drive back to raleigh with no problems at all. &amp; actually,
for you deadheads out there, chris left me a surprise in the glovebox - a
HQ copy of GD 5-8-77 Cornell. so for the hour &amp; 1/2 drive home i was
listening to a great show, was kept nice &amp; toasty by the well working heat,
&amp; was generally feeling good busma. all i could think to myself was
&quot;nothing left to do but smile, smile, smile...&quot;

&amp; am hoping that chris lets me inherit the rights to the westfakia namesake.
i cant wait for EveryBus!!!
