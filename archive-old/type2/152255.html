&gt; Great story but it sounds like you could some of  those rather

&gt; that also.  On my old starter, the  connector would not stay on for 30

I crimped and soldered all the connections on our OTHER diesel vanagon,
but not this one. Guess what I am doing today?

I'm also going to check the nightmare of wiring on our '77 Bay Westy to
make sure the evil fuel injection system is all tight.
