Subject: Re: [T2] 12mm Fuel Hose

It is 10mm, not 12mm!
And it is not under pressure except from gravity......it goes between the
filter and the inlet side of the pump.
It is available at your local Mercedes Benz dealer. A while back I posted
the MB part # for it. It is 112 476 12 26. Suggested list is $15.50 a meter
[39 1/4''] but you only need about 4''.


&gt; I am replacing all of my fuel hoses and have obtained several fathoms
&gt; of 7mm, fuel injection rated, hose from the Bus Depot.
&gt;
&gt; However, on my '76 2000 cc there is one section, from the fuel filter
&gt; to the fuel pump, that is of bigger diameter. It looks to be about
&gt; 12mm (interior diameter), but I can not find any reference about it
&gt; in any of the usual Type2/VW catalogs/web sites.
&gt;
&gt; Before I run around town looking for a suitable hose, can anyone
&gt; confirm that this is indeed 12mm ID?
&gt;
&gt; Also what pressure rating should I purchase?
&gt;
