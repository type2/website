 It is obvious to the casual observer that one of the major interest areas of this list is camping and I am curious as to why this seems to be limited mainly to the Bus conversions?  The early Corvair van campers used a roof-top camper unit 
(see http://www.mkellstrand_dot_com/corvairs/camper.html) as well as some split-window VWs 
(see http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/type2/photos/photosaccessories4.htm).

These units are still very much available and would seem to be a very practical alternative for the non-converted Bus owners among us (as well as the non-pop top Westys).

See:

http://www.bimo_dot_com/skydome1.htm

http://www.mantec.co_dot_uk/ (they specialize in Range Rover stuff but offer a roof-top tent in their &quot;overland essentials&quot; area)

http://www.themark.co.za/oa/equip/tent/10759.htm

http://www.autocamp_dot_de/english/products/
for commercial products or:

http://reality.sgi_dot_com/80_series/tech/roof_tent.html
for a home-grown version.

In reflection of the recent discussion of Eriba Puck trailers, there is a growing movement with the &quot;teardrop&quot;-style camping trailer.  Get all sorts of information at the Teardrop Trailers main site (http://www.teardroptrailers_dot_net/).
See all sorts of plans at the Tears and Trails index (http://www.teardrops_dot_net/plans01.html?).

Another Eriba alternative could also be the ultra-light tent-trailer style like the Lees-ure Lite camper (http://www.leesurelite_dot_com/).

Whichever way you go, have fun.
