Hola everyone....

Can't wait to get on the road to everybus....should be a hoot...

Thanks to everyone who responded, could have sold many more....maybe I
need to learn how to sew....

Still have the 34 Webers(No inquiries whatsoever...hmmmm) and the 79
camper is available too....

Will have a great set of stock Solex duals finished rebuilt by Friday
too....Is $150(US) for like new a reasonable price...I can even set them
up on my 1.8 so they're a bolt-on if you like...

Den..
