Subject: RE: [T2] VPC Air Conditioner for Station Wagon

&gt; #1. Wait for the pics.
&gt; #2. Ron is correct, go straight for the Sanden.
&gt; 
&gt; Ron may not remember that to get the sanden and
&gt;  kit that he sent to work, I had to put an entirelly  
&gt; different &quot;head&quot; onthe compressor.


I do remember. That was last year, when we had some Sandens at half price
that we'd bought on closeout from an A/C parts supplier. It turned out that
the heads on some of those units didn't fit properly when used in this
particular application due to the way the fittings protruded (so we had to
send another head). However, the Sandens we have now come with a different
head.
