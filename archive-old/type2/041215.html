Yes, the wire &quot;bails&quot;  ( or bales?)  wear out over time and lose their
tension.   Replacing them helped immensely and stop my valve cover gasket
leaks.  Also, check to see if the valve covers are warped by putting them on
a flat surface;  I used a old metal office desk that in my barn.

Good luck.

Howdy VW Fans,

I got a '78 Transporter and bought from a guy who just never drove it (twice
in the last 8 years). I got her home and found that the both cover gaskets
were dried out and leaking. No problem, take them off clean them and replace
them with new one $5 and a couple of hours. Only problem is it never solved
the problem. My question is has anyone else found that the wire clip that
hold the cover in place doesn't quite hold to good or is it that I didn't
clean them good enough. Thank you muchly.
