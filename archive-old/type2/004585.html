    Hello lister`s

    I have a 69 bus and i know she as a compression problem (less 30 %) and
due to a lack of money i´m woundering what could be the consequences of not
repair it right now. I would also like to know what  should i do to solve
that problem.

    Thank`s in advance.

    Paulo Gomes
