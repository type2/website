Another cheaper alternative, is to buy a 6 inch nipple from your
FLP(lumbing)S, screw it in the block and put the oil pressure sender on
the top of it.  The thread for the oil pressure sender is tapered 1/8&quot;
NPT (National Pipe Thread).  The nipple needs to be at least 6 inches
long such that the sender towers above the engine and does not interfere
with the distributor.  I did this about two weeks ago and it works
great.
