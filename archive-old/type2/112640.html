Subject: Re: [T2] major engine teardown woes

Bummer.
&gt;&gt;&gt;a) one of the heads has hairline cracks coming from both the intake and the
exhaust valves&lt;&lt;&lt;
If the crack is between the valve and the plug hole, that can be repaired, 
But only if you are on a low low low budjet. 2.0L used heads are easy to find 
in fair used condition! 

&gt;&gt;b) one of the cylinders has a huge chunk missing out of the bottom of it&lt;&lt;
Matty, where is this chunk now? In the case!!!

&gt;&gt;c) two of the pistons have huge gouges out of the sides, one big enough to
send a BB thru&lt;&lt;
Finish, garbage. you DON'T put used pistons, you don't mixed pistons 
(uneven compression and different weight) 
At best, find a good set of used pistons and cylinders.

&gt;&gt;&gt;2) Should I replace both heads at the same time or can the uncracked one be
used again? i.e. Do the heads need to be paired?&lt;&lt;&lt;
COMPRESSION/ratio!!! cheap budjet solution = find a used one, have both heads 
re-done. 
Respect compression ratio! or all the work (removing the engine) done will have to 
be done again. 

Cheap solution = find a good used engine! i guess you can find one for 300-600$
