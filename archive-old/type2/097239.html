Subject: Dutch Bus meeting pics online

Hello aircoolers,

I just wanna tell you that i have compiled a photo album of the Najaarsmeeting
of the VW Bus Club Nederland. This meeting was held last weekend in the
southern town of Helden in the Netherlands.

The meeting grounds were nice in a pinewood forest. Tall trees and a good
meadow to camp on. About 200 buses came to the meeting and alot of them were
Vanagons. However my heart lies at the T2 buses so most pics in the album show
that kind of bus.
It was fairly good weather on friday and sunday but on the saturday there was
more rain. But our club the Vrienden Club T2 had a nice solid tent with coffee
music warmth and beer!

You can find my photoalbum on http://members.home.nl/bulli/
Click on fotoalbum and then onto VWBCN Helden.

Enjoy my pics.....
