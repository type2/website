&gt; Surely this couldn't be it, but you're pretty much beyond the

&gt; Many of the DP manifolds have a vacuum port out to the left side. On
&gt; that
&gt; long tube that the carb mounts to. The conventional way to block this
&gt; up is
&gt; with a piece of gas line with a screw in it. If it were not blocked 
&gt; you

&gt; 
&gt; Let's grasp at straws together,

Long ago, a grizzled mechanic taught me not to plug unused vacuum lines
with screws.  The threads can provide an opportunity for a vacuum leak
just large enough to make idle adjustment difficult.

His solution, which I still use, is to push a small ball bearing (a bit
larger than the ID of the line) into the line.  It seals great, and
allows you to cut the line shorter than a line with a screw.
