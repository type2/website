Subject: Hello List!

Hello -

I hope this is appropriate for the list. I just signed up and wanted to say
hello. I have been a long time member of the Vanagon list and own an 85',
86', and a 90' but I signed up here because my SO, Patty, is purchasing a
78' 7 passenger. She loves it and I get to do the work on it - however I
don't know a lot and this is my first adventure into the AC engine.

Well, I won't take too much of your time. We should have the Bus on Friday.
I'm sure I'll have lots of questions for you all - but I'll check with John
Muir and Archives first.

We are excited and can't wait to get to work on the bus.

Take care,

Jeff &amp; Patty
