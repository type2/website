Subject: Re: [T2] FRIDAY CAMPER QUESTION (:

I'm 5'-7&quot; so if I am gorilla camping, I sleep lying on the floor, out of sight.

All other times, I/we sleep with our head towards the middle.
We often leave the sliding door open so as to enjoy the view as we doze off.
In the morning, it is easier for me to get up, make coffee, and hand Mary 
Beth her cup of coffee right through the open sliding door.

On  those occasions when it is a night for the stars to be more fully 
enjoyed, we will sleep with the hatch left open and have our heads toward 
the hatch.

On those occasions when I am by myself, I will sleep in the top cot, and 
there you have no choice as to where your head is to be located.

Yes, there is an answer in here someplace................ on occasion.
