single port heads...and a strange speedometer thang...

 

 

any good place on the web to get em? where do you'all get your parts? 

also, a strange instrument panel thing...the gas gauge &quot;flickers&quot;...it does not stay steady, but jumps around near where the actual level should be...the speedometer does the same thing....in the past i have seen speedometers do that, as a result of a wore out dust cap...but this one seems fine...even tossed a little jb weld on it to assure its stability...but it still fluctuates maddeningly, bouncing from 45 to 70 when iam doing 55...so, must be in the gauge itself, right? so, replacing the instrument panel seems the logical thing to do...

woe, lots of questions there!

 

anyway, just a gray summer day in the northbay, ca! the ol' haight street fair in san francisco is today, perhaps the &quot;summer of love van&quot; should attend!
