Ron:
additional info re:

Brakes: air in one caliper will cause brake delay on that side,
but will &quot;almost catch up&quot; under compression.
a rusty almost broken center steering coupler (sheet metal box)
on the front axle beam center, will actually break off and all
steering will be lost. mine happened in a parking spot, and not
on the expressway at 75 miles an hour.

Noise:
 inexpensive solutions to a very expensive noise at the rear ;

(I had to ride shotgun w/ my head in the engine bay to find this one!) :
the upper shock bolt had worked all the way out, but there was no damage
to the threads nor the chassis, and tightened up just fine. simple, but
expensive! :...  my buddy that was driving ( wrong gear, clutch jerk, grind,
overrev, grind, force gear, grind.....&quot; Yeah, I usta&quot; have one of these
{sic: Late Bus}
back in the sixties ! &quot; ) .

the other cheap solution turned out to be loose tools (vw jack ? ) in the
empty spare tire reservoir.
