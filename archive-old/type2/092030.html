Subject: Re: [T2] compression readings

You know Mike,, you have a good point that I forgot to report... I did go through 12 liters in 1500 miles, to EveryBus and home,,, as I expected due to blowby.
The spark plugs are nice and tan,,no sign of burning oil there ,, 

I think it is blown out of the engine as it looks like a self oiling device now,,,
oil all over the rear of the bus ,,,

It spins over very quickly,, and starts up quick tooo....

&gt; Hmmm, I'm not that low yet- ( 236k mi, no rebuild, 120 lbs compr, but
&gt; some valve leakage on #1, so it is about 95.  -but how much blowby is
&gt; getting into your crankcase?  I blow twice as much oil driving at 70
&gt; that at 50!  It averages a quart per 200 mi.  The actual compression
&gt; once it runs and oil is sloshed behind the pistons may be higher- how
&gt; can it start with compression that low?  The mixture needs some
&gt; compression!
