Subject: Re: [T2] Decel valve, 81 air cooled

Disconnect the decel valve and plug both the
connection points with corks or whatevers. It will
still backfire. It will react better when you back off
the throttle though, and that was why I disconnected
mine many years ago. If you are getting a genuine
backfiring, there is air getting into the exhaust
somewhere. It can be anywhere from where the header
tubes bolt to the exhaust ports on down. No air = no
backfire. -BaH

&gt; Hi all. A lurker coming forth, looking for help.....
&gt; 
&gt; I have major backfiring when decelerating, from my
&gt; 81 2.0L, and have been
&gt; looking at the decel valve, hoping to find the
&gt; source of the problem. Been
&gt; hassling folks on lists for answers,  and I
&gt; understand enough now, &lt;&lt;SNIPPERED&gt;&gt;
