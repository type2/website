Note:  I know this guy, and have seen the bus a lot.  it has a modified
camper interior, with the closet modified not to occlude the windows.  Its a
fairly nice bus, definitely of the cal-looker variety.  He's s'posed to be
getting me pix for me to put up on my web site in the next couple days, but
he's lagging hard...
