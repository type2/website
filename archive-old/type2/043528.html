Subject: senior vehicle owners

Gentlepersons-
                       As fellow senior vehicle owners, we should note the 
passing of Christian
Eich, of BMW, in the recent SST crash. Eich was involved with the British 
Motor Heri-
tage Trust (I'm sure quite a few Bus owners are multi-marqued...), and was 
attempting
to transfer ownership to a private trust to continue operations and parts 
sourcing (we
VW owners can surely relate to that).
                       On a lighter note, in view of the FBI's Carnivore 
program, I suppose I will
have to return to an old signature line...Those familiar with the work of 
Thomas Pyn-
chon will recognise it and if J. Edgar's scions are watching...The Washington 
library has
a copy of &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot;, I'm sure. Hi, guys!
