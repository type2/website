A year or so ago, I removed the motor from my 78 Westy, as it was burning
more oil than gas and had reached the 280K mile marker.  It took all that
time since to rebuild and furnish it with nice things from the Bus Depot.

Six months ago my daughter was born; coupled with active duty in the USN
and part-time college, I simply haven't had the time to finish the job.
Subsequently, I decided to pay a local self-purported VW guru to
re-install it.

Today, he told me that the Georgia heat justifies permanently removing the
air control flaps.  Insisted, in fact.  He also indicated that the flaps
aren't too critical for warm-ups in the *reasonable* winters here...

I've never heard this before, and I certainly don't remember seeing it in
Muir.  Does anyone have any perspective on this?

Secondly, in looking at the diagram of the flaps in my official VW service
manual, I noticed something I'd never seen before: an &quot;air injection
pump,&quot; which was apparently driven by an extension to the fan pulley.
What's the deal here?  What, exactly, is it's function?  Does it provide
additional
engine cooling?  If so, I might be quite interested in finding one, as
I'll be moving to the *unbelievably* hot Persian Gulf next year (and I'd
like
to bring her!)

Thanks in advance!
