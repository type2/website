Gentlepersons-
                       The single-breasted lady's bookstore is not the only 
source for books,
especially old/out-of-print/etc. on VW's or whatever...
                        Clinton R. Hull's &quot;Volkswagen Van Camper&quot; is 
available from an affiliate
bookseller through &lt;www.bookfinder_dot_com&gt;. The Advanced Book Exchange is 
another fine
source, as is Alibris...Why buy new, when used will do...
