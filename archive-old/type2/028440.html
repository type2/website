Hi Rick,

So why not just use a synthetic on your Westy?

&gt; Hi Rick, First,
&gt; it is a misnomer and unscientific to say oil breaks down. Remember, it was
&gt; tremendous heat and pressure that made the oil in the first place.

&gt; 20w50 simply cannot protect as well as 40wt in hot climates.  The 40wt has
&gt; NO multi-viscosity polymers to break down under heat.  Again synthetics
are
&gt; an exception here. Your test might prove something if engine oil just sat
in
&gt; one place over a stove burner, but it doesn't do that.

hey Steve, your suggestions are good and feed back is always a sign someone
is thinking!

Our tests were just static but did show how oils react under heat.  Most of
the oils turn into a thick sludge, very much like where they came from
before the refining proccess. And you are correct, the multi vis oils break
down more than the single weight oils.  Of course the best in our tests are
always the synthetics.  And unless your engine is leaking or burning the
oil, the synthetics would be the best way to go.

I do agree with you on the single weight oils, we always use 40W in the race
cars and it is a racing formula oil.  But in my westy which sometimes runs
in colder temps, I do prefer the 20W50 and the Lucas additive.
