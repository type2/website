Subject: RE:  914 motor into a bus (was 0mile engine)

&gt;Of course, your other option for the heads would be to replace them
with bus 
2.0 heads and sell the 914 ones on eBay for more than enough to cover
the new 
&gt;bus ones :)

Of course, there goes all your power. Those 914 2.0 heads had huge
valves and were killer. Be glad to trade you my Type4 2.0 heads if you
decide to go that way ;&gt;)
