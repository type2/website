Subject: Re: [T2] overfilling your oil???

Trust your dipstick. Start there. Drain out the oil and refill to the mark.
Go to a car wash, and clean the bottom of the engine.
It should be dry when you get home. Simple enough, yes ?
With the engine running ( wheels chocked, neutral gear, emergency brake
on ). you may find some leaks at their source this way.
Use a flashlight and follow the leaks uphill to the source as best you can.
Place a sheet of cardboard under the engine to mark additional oil leaks
overnight.
Overfilling will cause oil to leak out and maybe blow out the crank seals
front / rear. If you now see bad leaks, you will have to do some work, but
you must first start with the correct oil level to make the diagnosis. It
may well be stopped by simply correcting the level.

&gt; fellow listmembers...
&gt;
&gt; what happens when you put too much oil in your bus? can that cause
something
&gt; to start leaking?
&gt;
&gt; I have oil dripping off of those two little bolts/screws coming off the
&gt; bottom of the fan housing, LOTS of oil coming down off of the drivers side
&gt; heater box and drivers side engine mount.
&gt;
&gt; I checked and replaced the pushrod tube seals, but from inspecting them, I
&gt; do not think they were leaking to begin with.
&gt;
&gt; From looking, maybe coming out of the oil cooler?
&gt;
&gt; not sure where to start looking, or if I should just have someone else
work
&gt; on it, if its going to require a lot more knowledge than I have to tackle
&gt; the job. (mainly because its m daily driver, and work 40 hours a week.
cant
&gt; really have it out of commision too long)
