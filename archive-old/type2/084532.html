&gt;I met a guy here in town and when I told him I had bad rings he helped me 
&gt;to check it out. He removed the oil filler cap and felt over it and then 
&gt;reved the engine. He said there was no pressure, that it was fine.

Not a conclusive test.  The engine needs to be under a load (like full 
throttle) to be sure there is really no crankcase pressure.  Simply goosing 
the throttle isn't going to tell you squat.  If you *really* want to know 
the condition of your rings, a leakdown test is THE way to do it.

&gt;I did have the oil breather capped off and he said it should be open and 
&gt;preferably routed back to the carb or something, but there isn't a place 
&gt;for it on my single Weber Progressive.

He is right, it definately has to be routed somewhere, or at least 
vented.  You can't cap it off and expect not to blow oil past your 
seals.  You should route it to the air cleaner housing - if there isn't a 
port, you can install one.

&gt;He told me to do a compression test with and without oil and that may tell 
&gt;me whats going on. Here are the results:
&gt;
&gt;No oil added
&gt;3 (110)        1 (120)
&gt;4 (115)        2 (120)
&gt;With oil added to the spark plug holes:
&gt;3 (130)       1 (150)  damn!
&gt;4 (110)       2 (120)
&gt;
&gt;Both the front cylinder readings jumped up a bit. My spark plugs were very 
&gt;black and sooty looking. What does all this tell me? What else can I do to 
&gt;test the engine before we pull it tommorrow?

Yeah, the one cylinder went up a bit with the oil, but they were fairly 
even when dry which is a good thing.  Sooty plugs mean rich mixture, as 
long as they weren't wet.  My guess - there is nothing major wrong with 
that engine and the oil leaks would slow down or stop if the breather box 
were plumbed to the air cleaner or at least vented to the atmosphere.

&gt;If you made it this far the original engine in the 73 has this reading:
&gt;3 (70)           1 (130)
&gt;4(120)          2 (130)

I agree that this engine definately has a problem!

&gt;Something is definately wrong here!! No 3 cylinder is way low. I know its 
&gt;the one that typically fails, but what can I do to investigate this 
&gt;further. Should I use this engine or the 72 engine?

Try the oil test on the low cylinder, that will tell you whether it's rings 
or valves.  Regardless, the other engine would be my choice.
