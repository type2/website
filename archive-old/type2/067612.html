Subject: My VW page, air conditioning, Brave Combo, Hot Springs

First you can take a look at my bus and also of a picture of burning semi at 
my page address is www.ualr_dot_edu/~agroberts/index.html
It is  little rough the page is but will get better with time.
Second, the previous owner of my bus took out the compresser but left the 
overhead panal above the drivrs head for it. Only thing that bugs me about this
is going to from the back to the front it makes it real easy to smack your
cranium on. He said the extra weight is why he took it off.
Third, somone mention that they saw Brave New Combo in Austin. I saw them
earlier this year in Little Rock. Incredible band if you get a chance to see
them do.
Fourth I don't live Hot Springs, but on the weekends I go camping, hiking and 
traveling as far as my shallow pocket book will take me. This winter I may be 
driving to Hartford, CT and Amhearst, MA to visit friends. This fall I may and 
end up in Sumnter, SC to visit my sister and look for a job in Chapel Hills as 
computer/network tech at the university since that is what I do now in Little 
Rock.
Peace and a turtle
