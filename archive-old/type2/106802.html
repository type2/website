I pounded a long six point socket on mine.  Worked well once the bolt was

Wiser heads may have a better idea.

&gt; OK...so I was finally able to get my 2.0 liter air-cooled engine dropped solo
&gt; (only after snapping the ground bolt off my starter trying to loosen it as
&gt; well as cracking the plastic release bearing guide sleeve in the bell housing
&gt; of the tranny) but now I have one last bolt to get the exhaust system off and
&gt; its stripped. Any advice on how to get this bolt off? Vice grips will not fit
&gt; in the space and neither will my dremel to cut it. It seems that almost every
&gt; component has at least 2 or more different size bolts/screws so someone has
&gt; tinkered here before. Thanks in advance.
