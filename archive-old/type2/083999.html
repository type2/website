Subject: Re: [T2] why a stumble?

Jumping in here late- on the way to a camping event (around 20K mi ago),
I experienced similar symptoms, with stumbling under load, and I thought
it might be the points (rubbing block broke on me once- but then it ran
crappy at idle).  At the campground, I did a timing/dwell check to see
if that was the case (your timing would be like 12 deg retarded if
points block broke and you dwell would be way too large)- but dwell was
ok but timing advanced only to 26 or so- Jon (a local mechanic) whipped
the dist. out of there, did a little spraying with WD40 down inside,
twirled the base, and put it back in.  Advancees fine, no stumbling! 
It's still stock at 233,000 miles.
