The Jester, 69 sends:

&gt; Acetone works great for removing most residues... but its somewhat
&gt; nasty.  Couldnt be too bad though, its whats in nail polish remover...

We have a film cleaner at work that's fifty percent hexane and fifty percent
isopropyl alcohol, and the one time I tried removing window film a little
dab of this stuff did the trick.
