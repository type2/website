It's off.  The light goes off right away and stays off.  The chatter doesn't
last long.  Never more than a few seconds.  I like the lifter hole pointing
down theory.

&gt; on and the engine clatters 'til your oil pump regains its prime, then the
&gt; problem is more serious.  My theory on this is that it is time to replace
&gt; your (oil and) filter with a better filter.  some filters seem to let the
&gt; oil pump drain overnight and it takes 3-10 seconds for the pump to reprime
&gt; itself.  This is not good and should be avoided.

Luckily Bus Depot has fully stocked me with MAHLE filters!
