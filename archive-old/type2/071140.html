Subject: Re: [T2] JUMPING OUT OF GEAR
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

WHAT WOULD CAUSE A BUS TO COME OUT OF FOURTH GEAR? THE SHIFTER CAN BE
TIED BACK AND IT WILL STAY IN. THIS IS IN A 68.

Mike, How long has this been going on has it just started or has it been 
getting progressively worse?  The first thing I would is adjust the gearshift 
lever stop plate on the floor per Bentley.  If that doesn't help look at 
shiftrods and make sure they are tight and properly adjusted as well.  If 
none of the above do the trick then it sounds like the 4th gear synchronizer 
is going bad the teeth get worn and it jumps out of gear.  The worse thing to 
do is repeatedly slam it in 4th gear harder and harder trying to get it to 
stay.  You could bend rear shift rod and then it becomes shorter and it will 
never stay in 4th even after you get transmission rebuilt.  Take the 
conservative approach first and adjust stop plate on floor.  If you must 
drive it continue to hold it in gear with rope but I think that it's going to 
do more damage.  Marcus
