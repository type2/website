&gt;       Your first mission is in South Dakota, United States. Time is of the
&gt; essence so listen carefully. According to the Sept. 22 Des Moines
&gt; Register newspaper in Des Moines, Iowa in the classified section - over
&gt; 400 air-cooled vehicles are at stake. I quote:
&gt;       &quot;VW's  400+ mostly air cooled, cars to be disposed of this fall (605)
&gt; 335-7704&quot;
&gt;       Doing a little detective work, it was determined that the phone number
&gt; given originated in South Dakota. A preliminary call to that number
&gt; determined that noone was home. Therefore details are sketchy. Your
&gt; mission, should you wish to accept it is to:
&gt;       1) Make contact with the unknown party
&gt;       2) Determine scope of problem and types of vehicles involved
&gt; and     3) Report back to the list ASAP what you have found.
&gt;
Ok, I *know* someone has to live in South Dakota, and would just love to check
this out...
Don't make me contact special agent Joel to get names of folks in the area!
:)
Could this be another group buying opportunity????
