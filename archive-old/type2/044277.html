Subject: [T2] RE: Painted Hubcaps $24.95/set of 4

&gt; OK Ron, I'll bite. Then what holds them on them? The usual hubcaps (not
&gt; wheel covers) are mounted just outside the lug nuts.


This is what results from writing an email late in the day when the brain is
not functioning. :-)
Yes, the hubcap covers the lug nuts.  It just does not extended to the edge
of the wheel like the plastic wheel covers do.
