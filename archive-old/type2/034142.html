Subject: need rear bumper willing to buy or trade...

i'm looking for a rear bumper  for my '69 bus; also a handle for the inside 
of my push-window (i'm not sur what you call it.. it's in between the 
windshield and pasenger window) seat-belts, reflectors, and a locking 
push-button handle for a cabinet.  i have an old bumper, but it's a little 
rusty and dented...i have a cot to trade or sell as well, also some cot 
pieces...
