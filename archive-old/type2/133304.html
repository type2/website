you set the end play exactly the same as for a flywheel.

&gt; myself. I guess I could pull the flex plate off and install a flywheel since
&gt; I am going to put in a new seal anyway.

do you plan on putting the engine in a manual tranny bus???
manuals have flywheels
automatics have flexplates

they are not interchangable
