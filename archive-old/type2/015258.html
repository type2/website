Subject: valve adjustment w/ hydraulic lifters

Hello All:
It is time to adjust the valves. 
'78 AVP 2.0 rebuild with hyd. lifters.
I've read the muir,bentley and archives. But, I'm still
confused on a couple of things.

1- in the archives I read that with hydraulic lifters
the engine does not need to be cold. (sit over night).
If I understood correctly, please tell me if I am wrong,
I should loosen the adjusters and let engine run for minute
or two to pump up the lifters. then adjust.... 
am i way off here? is this correct?

2- When adjusting, loosen adjuster, then tighten until
it makes contact, then 2 more turns.
is a 'turn' 180 degress or 360 degrees?

Which is worse, valves too loose? or valves too tight?
i would think neither one is good for the life of an engine.
but if i was to err, would it be better to err on the loose
side, or the tight side?

any advice, tips, suggestions you could share would be appreciated!

thanks-
Rob
