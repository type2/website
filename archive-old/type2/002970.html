Subject: Re: [T2] continually tight valves


&gt;Recent discussions about torqueing head bolts makes me wonder. Nearly
&gt;evertime I adjust my valves, usually 2,000-2,500 miles, they are tight.
Like
&gt;I can't even get the .006 in there tight. Not always all of them, but maybe
&gt;6 out of the 8. Any reason why this would be? The SIR ruibld has about
&gt;12,0000 miles on it now, but the same was true of my old engine. I was told
&gt;they would be tight as it breaks in.

    I had tight valves on an engine with brand new VW heads, ended up that
the heads had bad seats from the factory.  Had to have a valve job, new
seats and new exhaust guides after less than 10K miles.  Been fine since
then.

    Anybody else getting bad seats from new Brazilian heads? (1600 DP)
