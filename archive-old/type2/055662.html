Subject: East Coast show update: Litchfield &amp; Terryville

Hi Volks,
  Just got off the phone with Chuck Pisconski, the promoter of the
Litchfield Bug-In and Terryville Bug -a-Fair. 
 The Date for Terryville has been changed for August 23rd to August
30th.  Camping is available at the fairgrounds the nite before.

 As many of you know, the Litchfield Bug-In has been moved to the
Harwinton Fairgrounds in Harwinton,CT. (Only 10 miles of original site)
What you might not know is that there is Camping available the nite
before at the fairgrounds.  The cost is 15 bucks and that includes
admission to the show Sunday.  That show is Scheduled for June 21st. 
   LiMBO is looking for Volunteers to help out with parking and judging
of buses at both shows. If anyone can helpout, please contact me here at
LiMBO or Email Ned Rothstein _at_ nednstu_at_tiac_dot_com.

Reservations for camping can be made by calling Chuck _at_ 860-283-5256.
Thanks, hope to see you there. Take care.
