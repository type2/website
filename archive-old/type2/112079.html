Subject: Investigation on sticker in Doorjam

A little while ago Alex Wisniewski asked me if I know
the meaning a a certain sticker in his 1977 type 22.
The sticker is in the doorjam says:

   &quot;Karte Card Carte 246&quot;

It also shows a logo which I think is of the VW
maintenance programm. Here's are two pictures:

overview of the doorjam in Alex's bus:

close-up of the sticker:

So now I am wondering if anyone knows the meaning of
this sticker.

And if you happen to have a sticker like this in your
bus then end me a message personally(!) so we do not
put too many short messages on the list. My
emailaddress is:

    molenari_at_yahoo_dot_com

I am interested to know:

  1. what type of bus do you have
     (Type 21, 22, 23, etc.)
  2. What kind of engine was originally in it
  3. what is the modellyear of your bus (3rd
     digit in chassisnumber)

I am curious!
thanks in advance.
