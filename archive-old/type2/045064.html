Subject: [T2] &lt;F&gt; Bus in Blythewood

Does anyone on the list drive a black, post '72 bus around Blythewood, SC? I 
see him (or you) about twice a week at the &quot;Threshing Floor&quot; parking lot. If 
not, I guess I need to print out a flyer and give it to him. And to correct 
my political uncorrectness, I know it's a him, I have seen him (or you) 
driving down the road.
