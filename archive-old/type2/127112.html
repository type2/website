Subject: Re: [T2] Why I drive a VW bus...

i liked your reply john.... it was honest and straight to your point,.....
i didnt however agree with it but that is me....
i got the point and the laughter you were sending from the stickers...
even though it wasnt my bit of stand up ~!~
 
most folks see the bus in a hippy state of mind....(me included but thats just me)
dont know why i guess the same reason when i tell them i am cherokee they think i live in a tepee still...? go figure..?
and dance around the fire and sing...
well at least the part about living in the tepee isnt true .....~!~
 
a baja bus sounds cool wouldnt mind one of those myself one day to go play in. used to go mudslinging as a teen in a old jeep wrangler... till we drowned it and us crossing a mighty big hole one day with a case of emptys in the back,,,
 
you are entitled to why you drive a bus as well....
funny thing is there is alot of people out there that are bus drivers........
you are what you are.....and your bus is yours as ours are ours.....
i have met all kinds of vw bus folks and by far are they all hippys but they are all the kindest i have ever met no matter there backgrounds or preferences to there life or lifestyle..some doctors, some engineers, some teachers, some writers,some just mom and dads,...
 
hope you dont play bad cop with the hippy vans.....?
there is nothing much better in this world when we are talking about bus peoples...
I have seen them do things for me that no one would have ever of done in any other club or car association  or event or situation.,.,.,. trully amazing folks....
 
ps i bet that is a site to see with that bus jacked up in the air and camo ;d up real good and your uniform on....?
 
just one more sticker you need though IMO,.,.,.,.
I fought the law and the law won.....~!~
 
peace
Cha
 
ps
tree hugging, dirt 
worshipping, Birkenstock wearing, whale saving, dope smoking(only good grass though)&lt;lol, granola biting, Clinton voting, U.S. citizen~!~ &lt; that would sum me up better than some of the other things...
btw our country isnt getting any more civil or educated by bush~!~

Ah, come on. That is exactly what I was talking about. Now see, I could 
respond with something similar to: &quot;Is there actually a social or economical 
class that is protected for left wing, pinko, commie, tree hugging, dirt 
worshipping, Birkenstock wearing, whale saving, dope smoking, granola biting, Clinton 
voting, non-bathing, draft dodging U.S. citizens?&quot;, but that would be getting 
too serious. Ah, lighten up, and live! I love the first admendment, and love 
that you have the same ability to express your viewpoints. So why would my 
original post get someone upset? It is humorous, and was intended to be from 
the start, unlike some VW's I've seen in town and their hateful messages. But 
then again, to each his own...

Thanks for the reply,

John
