I looks like asbestos to me.  The replacement heater ducts don't
contain asbestos; however, they don't look like the original tubes.

I still have originals.  I worry more about CO leaks than asbestos. 
I personally believe that if you don't disturb asbestos, it's not a
problem.  But that's just my opinion. I could be wrong.

&gt;I haven't had this stuff tested yet but I'd bet that this white 
&gt;fibrous
&gt;stuff that is used for the heater duct gaskets is asbestos. And what 
&gt;might
&gt;be inside those ducts that bridge between the heat exchangers and 
&gt;the hard
&gt;ducting under the bus?  Anybody found asbestos free replacements for 
&gt;these?
&gt;Seems like a terrible place to use the stuff.
