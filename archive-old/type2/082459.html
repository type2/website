Subject: Looking for &quot;RAH&quot;

Sorry to trouble the list with this, but I accidentally deleted a message from 
someone asking for info about engine conversions.  He signed his e-mail &quot;RAH&quot; 
and I seem to recall the address as being for Rob Hand or something like that.  
If you're out there, please e-mail me at mikeg_at_pcisys_dot_net
