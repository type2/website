tomorrow i'm gonna go over everything in my van,starting with ignition and 
working up, just to make sure that my problem is indeed the servo.

if i do need one, what year busses are compatible?  i've had some people 
offer some to me from different years, and there is also some good local 
junkyards around that i'm sure i could yank one from, but i need to know 
year compatablility.....thanks.....

mark. '78 fi van.
