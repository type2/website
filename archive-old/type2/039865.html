&gt;I'm a Ham Radio Operator, and wanted to mount an antenna on a westy.
&gt;I cut a hole about four inches in diameter, in  the fiberglass in the middle
&gt;of the top just above the drivers seats. The a mag mount goes through the
&gt;hole and mounts on the metal roof, and it will work fine, and the cable can
&gt;be routed into the cab from there.

Recently a hailstorm destroyed my plastic roof vent cover.  I replaced it 
with a metal one from an RV store.  I have been getting by with a short 
glass-mount CB antenna but it occurs to me that I could mount an antenna on 
the roof vent now, or even use a mag mount on it.  I will try this when I 
get a round tuit.  For anyone that has a roof vent, this might be an option.
