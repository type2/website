Subject: Air hoses for '80-'82 Vanagons

A few days ago a list member posted his measurements for all the
various vacuum hoses associated with his '80 Vanagon.  Since I'm
re-doing my '81 Vanagon I saved the message......at least I thought
I did!

Would the list member who wrote this article re-post, or send it to
me directly?

Thanks!
