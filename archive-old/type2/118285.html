Subject: fyi, need fasteners?...boltdepot_dot_com

Hi,

Just mentioning that I've been on somewhat of a quest recently to
locate and replace a number of the fasteners on my Vanagon.

I had to replace a front turn signal lens last year and found the
heads on the screws rusted nearly to the point of being unusable.

I looked at Lowes, I looked at Home Depot but it was the same
story....an inconsistent selection that had been rooted through by
folks to the point that I might find 1-2 of what I needed but never 4.
Also, they were available in steel or zinc but never stainless.

While they don't have everything they have quite a few....

Careful...I managed to order the wrong size a couple times but I'll
find a use for stainless screws eventually.  Its worth it to get the
right ones in stainless.

(They also have a survey in the left hand column that gets you a free
thread guage in metric or U.S. for filling it out.)


Sincerely,
--
