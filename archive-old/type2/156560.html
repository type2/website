Subject: Re: [T2] exhaust leaks- are old gaskets still available?

Mike - I use a product from VICTOR (the gasket people)
that looks like a toothpaste tube (but orange) The
stuff inside comes out the consistency of
toothpaste... You smear it all over the uneven
surface, bolt 'er together and let it set up. It
hardens like a soft ceramic for lack of a better
description. I have been using it on all my exhaust
joints for about 15 years now. It is the only product
of the exhaust patching variety that I can swear
absolutely works 100%. If you still use a gasket, and
the surfaces are really uneven, coat all 4 surfaces -
I prefer to use no gasket and deal with only two
surfaces! Yes, it can be removed.
