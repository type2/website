&lt;&lt; Some questions:
 Does a vw engine fit on a generic stand?
 Are any adapter parts needed?
 Am I correct in assuming that the engine can be rotated on any of these
stands?
 Is there any reason to prefer the stand advertised in the RMMW catalog that
 presumably is customized to fit a vw engine?
 
 Thanks, Jack &gt;&gt;
I mated a normal bench mount VW stand to a generic roll around stand.  I had
pretty much ran out of bench space in my shop and I like the idea of having a
mobile stand.  I see no reason why you could fab a mount for your VW engine.
But hear are some other ideas I incorporated in to my stand.  Instead of
rotating the engine with a short handle (a draw back on most el cheapo stands)
I replaced this short coming with an old chrome 3-spoke steering wheel.  Not
only does it make the engine a breeze to rotate, but it makes moving the stand
a lot more fun.  The other addition I added was a pipe with a gland nut welded
to it for building cranks.  It's so nice!  One more thing to think about.  Be
sure you have a way to get your clutch pilot tool in.  I have a hole in the
face of my stand and just slide the tool forward when its time for the clutch.
Another advantage is I always know where my clutch poilt tool is!!
   Peace, Love, and next project-drip tray and tool rack,
