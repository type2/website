For what it's worth, my pride &amp; joy (aka 82 westie ayrcool) had a
hiccup/TINY miss that was't fixed by a tune up.  It would occasionally
die when you tried to get going at a stop sign, etc.  Nice folks on the
list suggested a mixture prob... and were right (mostly).
So off to my mechanic-  quite a few $ later, it was found to have 3
wires broken in the wiring harness and a bad temp sensor on the
manifold.  We also reset the mix.
It now runs like a ethiopian distance runner- with a lack of attention,
I'll fly down the hiway at 75+ with 2+ inches of pedel left.  I'm very
happy.  The moral of the story- don't forget those little sensors on
late busses.  I never would have figured it out!
All is not rosy tho- while getting fixed, my mechanic put  small dent in
the LR corner. But he's good for it, and it's in line for new paint
anyway....  What 'cha think it costs to paint a bus?
AND- I got a 'seal of approval' on my first tune up
(pts/plugs/timing/etc)!  I did it all by myself with no extra parts left
over! ;)
a big THANK YA'LL to those who helped 
pppps,
Kevin
