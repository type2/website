Thanks, Pat, for posting the info. on Phil on this list. I hadn't
heard it before.

I drive buses *and* listen to the Dead. I don't do one because I do
the other, but they always seemed to go together really well.

I hope Phil gets a liver if that's what he needs. I would like to hear
him play a few (hundred) more times.

I *do* agree with Thom on the organ donor card. Mine is part of my
driver's licence. I hope you all have yours filled out too, but I also
hope it doesn't matter any time soon. We've had enough of that around
here lately.
