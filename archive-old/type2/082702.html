Subject: Hate to do this (again!)...

...but I need to sell my 71 Campmobile project. Here's
&gt; the stats:
&gt; Not running, but rolls, brakes are functional. Has 4
&gt; NEW LT tires (forget which brand).
&gt; Case has been line bored for .010 oversize mains,
which
&gt; I have. Crank has been cleaned and mains polished,
&gt; bearings pressed on.Tranny is fine, have new t/o
&gt; bearing.
&gt; Heads have been bead blasted, ready for new valves.
&gt; Engine tin is complete and repainted.
&gt; Floors in cab have been POR15'd and repaired. Body
is
&gt; straight w/some small dents (quarter-sized. Rust
&gt; damage is confined to battery tray and same rear
&gt; quarter, outer rockers and roof has surface rust. In
&gt; the time I've had the bus,it has been stored in a
&gt; garage. Was a Cali bus until 3-4 years ago.
&gt; Interior is complete, front seats need padding and
&gt; recovering.
&gt; I have TONS of spares for the bus - oil pumps,
cables,
&gt; carbs, dizzies, trim rings, rods, valve springs,
&gt; couple of generatorsa, etc. All will go with the
bus.
&gt; This is an excellent project - I have neither the
time
&gt; or $$ for it now. It will be offered only to you
&gt; listees (unless I get no response...) for $500, a
very
&gt; fair price (read, no dickering please). The bus is
&gt; located in Cornwall, NY (Orange County).
&gt; Interested listees should contact me off-list at:
