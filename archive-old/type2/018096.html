Subject: would 009 diz cause a '77 too run hotter than a stock diz?
Message-ID: &lt;37455C99.FD365CDB_at_mindspring_dot_com&gt;

Hey all,
1st off thanks to those who sent replies regarding earlier 009 diz
question. Now one more quick one...

I am not sure if I may be looking too hard for problems, but it seems to
me that the engine is running hotter now than it had been previously
with the stock vacuum advance dizzy.  Is it possible that the 009 would
cause the engine to run hotter?  According to the mechanic my old vacuum
diz had no advance at all (I do trust this person from past
experience).  I seem to have a great deal more power now.  I do notice a
brief pause when I first give it gas when standing still, and am
guessing this is what people refer to as a flat spot. What concerns me
is that I was able to drive on the freeway 25 or so miles and stop and
be able to put my hand on the fan housing and it would not be so hot as
the need to remove it.  Today it was too hot to keep my hand on it for
more than 5-10 seconds. Also the bumper felt quite hot. 

The other changes that coincide with the new dizzy;
1. New exhaust system, A pacesetter. Which I was rather disappointed to
find is nearly as loud as my old rusted system. 
2. Had my auto transmission serviced.

By the way if you are in need of a quick patch to the exhaust pipes, I
used aluminum chimney flashing and fastener clamps. I first wrapped the
pipe with reynolds wrap, then put the flashing over that, then clamped
it down real tight.  My first emissions test was aborted because of too
high a level of oxygen in the exhaust pipe.  After my patch I passed the
emissions test with plenty of room to spare!

Thanks,
Scoob
