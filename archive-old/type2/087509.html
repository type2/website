Subject: Re: [T2] what i will admit to today

ah, same thing, same place on the bus, different geographical location in
the world. that is a very sneakly thing in that it is a very hidden defect.
fortunately easily accessible. i wouldn't pull a rocker assembly as a
regular check up, but it is recommended to look very carefully during
rebuild and w/i 5-10k miles in install given the probability of mileage and
type of usage...'specially #3. we will survive.  was yours a type1 too?  -

&gt;Hi Stevo,
&gt;
&gt;It was my engine that broke in Nevada, and it was the rocker shaft stud on
&gt;the #3 cylinder.  I think it was just a bad stud, as there was nothing else
&gt;wrong with the engine.  Anyway, it's good to check that stuff out before
&gt;something goes badly wrong, especially if it could leave you stranded in th=
e
&gt;middle of nowhere.
&gt;
&gt;Good luck!
