Subject: Introduction

Since this is &quot;open Friday&quot;, Please allow me to introduce myself.
My Name is Ron Cheshire, also known as Dr. Pepper.
I have owned and been around VDUB's since the 1960's,
but have not had one since the early 1980's. I live in Ridgecrest,
California, in the High Desert, about 90 miles West of Death Valley.

I just bought a 1972 bus last week.
The timing was WAY out, and the guy couldn't fix it. I paid $600.00
for it. The body is straight, with only minor dings and problems that
are readily fixable, and it seems to run OK when I fixed the timing.
The paint is fair  to good.

This puppy has a large sun roof. It also has a ponderous steel bush
basher, front and rear, I think I'll be removing all that metal and
trading it for standard bumpers. I will post pix if anyone is interested,
just let my know.

I've been following this list for about a week, and find it very interesting.
I hope that I can contribute to it as well as gleaning all the great information.

I am a Ham Radio operator and a &quot;Scannerist&quot;

Thanx
