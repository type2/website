Subject: Please Stop

Okay. I spent years tending these resources, man of y'all have spent years
BEING these resources, and I don't want to see any more of them degerate.

I will do what I can to see about a CD if you will all please stop this.
I'm as angry as anybody else but please just stop, there's nothing to be
gained now, so shut up. No promises, last I heard Hoover was taking a job
that would have him abroad for months at a time and I might not be able to
get hold of him, but I will try if you will please KILL this THREAD.

But if you don't I won't. So put a sock in it.
