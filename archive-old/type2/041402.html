Subject: Please define &quot;lugging&quot; the engine

I have been meaning to ask this for some time. I have a '70 bus daily driver 
with 1600sp engine. I do have a tachometer. I was wondering what is 
considered &quot;lugging&quot; as far as RPM in this engine? I have tried not to 
accelerate below 1800-2000 rpm especially uphill. I just wanted to know what 
is considered the lower limit? Related to that is the &quot;redline&quot;. I see in the 
Bentley and others it rates the engine max horsepower at 4400 rpm. I have 
tried not to go over 3500 rpm and going as high as 4400 rpm on that old a 
design worries me. Am I overly concerned? Thanks in advance for the advice.
Dana
