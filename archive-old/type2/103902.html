Subject: Looking for rest stops on I75

Well I am leaving Toronto ON for Orlando FL, taking I75 the 
whole way down. I will have my trusty AIRS and LIMBO books 
with me but I thought I would put a request out to you Volks 
to see if anyone can offer up a driveway for an evening in 
case I need to make an unplanned stop.

The trip takes me through Detroit, Cincinatti, Lexington, Mt. 
Vernon, Knoxville, Atlanta (I have already heard from a bunch 
of people here), Macon, Valdosta, Orlando. And all points in 
between.

Anyone along the way who wouldn't mind a visitor this weekend 
(or on the return trip next weekend) please let me know. We 
won't stay long and we won't intrude. Just looking for an 
emergency driveway.

It is the maiden voyage of my refurbished Vanagon Westfalia 
so I want to make sure I am covered.

Thanks,
Chris
