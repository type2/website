Subject: vintage voltmeter

Yep, I remember them well. They are actually a load
tester. Back when batteries had exposed lead straps
connecting the cells the tester could be pushed onto
the straps which would impose a load while measuring
the resulting voltage for that one cell under load.
There used to be battery rebuilding shops that would
replace just the bad cell.

&gt; On page 7 of Bentely's electrical section there's a
photo of a 
vintage
&gt; voltmeter used to measure the voltage of each
battery cell. I see 
this style
&gt; of meter is still sold but I'm wondering how useful
it really was. 
Does
&gt; anyone remember using one?
