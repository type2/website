Subject: Re: [T2] high idle when warm

Guys,

Ditto lately on my engine as well.(it's gotten colder here).

Starts better when it's cold outside, but still not as well as I think it 
should.

I also noticed over the weekend that it suddenly seems to be idling at 
higher speed when coming off the hiway.

Read the decel posts in the archive and will try disconnecting it again 
and looking for vacuum leaks again, but I have never found any yet with 
the engine starter fluid.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hey folks, my recently rebuilt 79 Westy w/2.0L FI
&gt; engine experiences a higher than normal idle when
&gt; fully warm after being on a road trip.  It also seems
 to idle a little too low when cold.  It's got a new
 cold start valve and thermo-time sensor and double
 relay.  The auxiliary air regulator is closing
 completley when warm.  
I've looked in the FI manuals,
 the Bentley and the archives and can't seem to find
 any answers relative to this particular issue.  Any
 light(s) you might shed on the problem would be
 helpful and appreciated.  Thanks, Greg
