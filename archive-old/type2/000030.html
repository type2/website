Subject: Oil Oil, Clean motor

I disassembled most of the motor tin and dropped the heat exchangers they 
were filled with between the skin and core.  Anyhow its all clean and I 
parked it over a piece of wood to monitor the leaks.  The good news for today 
so far is the lack of a single drop on the board, indicating it is a pressure 
fitted piece that is leaking.  I'm going to replace the oil cooler rubber and 
check the relief valve.  Replace if I can find another, and hope for the 
best.  Any ideas as to what else would drop oil in to the exchangers? It 
seems as if the case has to much pressure, but not positive.  Sorry about the 
lack of trouble shooting time on my part its just getting to be hell here 
with the move fast approaching and I really want to take my baby home with 
me.  I just have to weigh out the cost of making road worthy or taking a 
pocket full of change and purchasing something there.
Peace Out
