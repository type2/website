Subject: What is it:  Answer (?)

&gt; Since it's Friday, I thought I'd challenge the list geniuses to try to
&gt; figure this picture out. It looks to me like a homemade compressor,
&gt; but why would it be in a Bug? The more I look at it, the more confused I
get.

&gt; The fins on the cylinders are appropriate for a compressor, not
&gt; &gt; an engine that generates power.
&gt; &gt; I wonder if the air intake and runners are dummies, and the
&gt; &gt; cylinders are solenoids- the reciprocating electric motor! :) But then
&gt; &gt; there would be big wires, not the spidery intake runners, going to
&gt; &gt; the cylinders.
&gt; &gt; I'd like to know the story behind it! But I'm inclinded to doubt
&gt; &gt; it powers the Beetle it's apparently installed in. There seems to
&gt; &gt; be snow on the rear fenders... so its parked outside.


 I just recieved this email:

Hi,

 I know this is odd, but it looks like an electric motor I inadvertently
 designed while trying to make a perpetual motion machine.

I'd rather not be more specific but that is why it has all of the heavy-duty
electrical wiring and the semi-disributor still attached, as well as no
exhaust. The intake air is only for cooling.

Feel free to post this to the list (I'm not a member right now.)
