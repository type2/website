Subject: Re: [T2] Oil pressure gauge readings...

Well I've just wired mine up and only driven the bus twice, so limited
experience here :-)
About 60 psi at idle on startup, down to 20 psi when good and hot, 40-60 off
idle depending on oil temp.

As for oil temp, well I posted the other day that I wasn't sure whether it
was working, now I know it isn't working as it doesn't move after a good 15
mins at 60 mph.  Any tips for troubleshooting?  If I ground the sender wire
should the pointer go over to the right?  I will try it later and see if it
does.  I'm thinking if it doesn't I must have an open circuit or a faulty
gauge, and if it does I may have a faulty sender?

(OK, I can see in hindsight it would have been better to test the thing
before I installed it but I was short of time.)
