Subject: Re: [T2] steering wheel

&gt;If you go aftermarket, be sure to keep the same
&gt;diameter...Smaller wheels are cute as a Bug until
&gt;you try parking... ;-(

Everyone warned me about this when I was looking to
put a smaller steering wheel on my bus (I am a big
guy, and was kinda cramped behind that big 'ol
steering wheel), and I'm happy to report that it
didn't make much of a difference at all.  Granted, I
haven't had to parallel park yet, but then again, this
is Ohio - how often do I have to parallel park?!? 
There is a pic and more details here:
