Subject: Re: [T2] Trip Speedo

&gt; Forgive me if this subject has been beaten to death,
&gt; I searched the archives and found discussions but no
&gt; real answers for this one.  How common are speedos
&gt; with a reset-able trip odometer for the bay window
&gt; buses?  I just bought one and it's dated 9/74. 

This is what I know about the speedo with trip
recorder, let me know if I am wrong:

- Not available in miles
- was put in buses from modelyaer 1973 and up
- came automatically with the dashclock on vehicles
with KM-counter (M-code 25)
- was fitted standard in Deluxe buses from 1973
onwards

1973 is the last year with the old-style speedo (grey
with light grey centre) so they are quite hard to find
for this year.
