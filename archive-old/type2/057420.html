&gt; Not having seen it, I can't comment except to say that applications

&gt; don't make huge demands on cooling.  The engine was probably fairly
&gt; open (no bodywork around it) as well.

    Fairly open, yes, but also continually covered with a layer of
sawdust (which, BTW, is a fantastic insulator). Daily maintenance
included removing the bottom deflectors and scaping all the sawdust from
between the fins, etc. And believe me, that little 1500cc was cranking
wideopen when actually sawing. In fact it was possible to stall the
engine when sawing some hardwoods or frozen logs, And it did this 8-10
hours a day, 6 days a week for years -- far harder work than what these
engines get in a car, where usually they run for an hour or two a day
with occasional long trips. 
    Pretty neat little rig, that sawmill. Had a big honking magneto on
it in place of the distributor, started with a rope. Had to be very
careful with tuneups or you'd seriously regret it when it tried to break
your wrist. Almost ate two of my fingers one day when I was sharpening
the teeth and forgot to flip the switch off. It fired on just one
cylinder when I turned the blade, took my hand right up into the guard,
broke one finger and cut it and another pretty badly. I was all alone,
had to stick my hand in a spring run to numb it enough to let me get my
head back together. 
    Sorry, I just don't buy the theory that a sealed compartment is at
all necessary, or even desirable. I suppose if you live in a big city
and spend hours each day sitting in traffic jams, the engine compartment
seals might have a point. OTOH, I've never seen an idling VW engine
overheat, unlike waterboxers. And for that matter, anytime I'm in a
traffic jam or waiting for a train, etc. I always turn that puppy off
anyway. Why waste gas? 8-)
