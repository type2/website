Subject: Re: [T2] Whats the secret for removing push rod tubes??

--- Andrew Burczyk &lt;Andrew.Burczyk_at_monarch_dot_net&gt; wrote:
&gt; To keep from damaging the pushrod tube I put a small
&gt; hose clamp around it
&gt; and tighten it down.  One of those small clamps that
&gt; has a worm gear built
&gt; into it that meshes with slots cut in the metal
&gt; strap.  Once its tight you
&gt; can grab the worm gear by the ends with a vice grip.

This is a GREAT idea, as I have tried all the others
with no success. I will try it as soon as I get home tonight.
