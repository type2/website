Subject: Re: [T2] More Ball joint/torsion arm Questions

Brandt, Volks,

I have seen the other responses, but want to throw a couple mor pence in
the fountain....

&gt; 1)Do I have to do both sides at the same time? Is there some tension thing I
&gt; am missing? Seems like I am (step 19 Mike Gensler, in Library)

You don't have to, but it is wise to.  the general rule on anything
related to suspension/brakes is to do both ends of the axle at the same
time.  with the ball joints, you are committed to a front end alignment
afterward, why pay for two?  The tension thing is that there is still a
pre-load holding the upper arms against the horn of the front axle beam
and it is difficult to get the upper arms off as a result.  Mike
Gensler's article describes it well.

&gt; 2)My upper Bus-boys pre-pressed balljoints don't have the hex shaped
&gt; &quot;eccentric ring&quot; on the upper ball joint. Should I be concerned?

No, they swap from the old arms.  Removal can be a bear, but they are
*not* welded on (appearances to the contrary :-)

&gt; 3)Are the torsion arm seals NLA? Do they usually need to be replaced? And
&gt; what about the needle bearing? (Bentley 2,18 Fig 7-16) Does a 78 have this?
&gt; and is it NLA? or usually worn to the point of needing replacement?

I have always clened and reused the seals.  They really don't wear.  If
the needle bearings are bad, then you need a new beam.  Even if they were
available, the procedure for removal and replacement is &quot;involved&quot;  I have
never woried about it and so far, it has not bitten me.  I wipe a rag over
them and check to be sure they do roll.  So far all have been fine.

&gt; 4)Should I use anti seize on anything when I put it back together? Is it
&gt; worth getting a socket that fits the ball joint nuts for proper torque? And
&gt; What kind of grease should I buy? Brand, type?

I anti-seize all nuts as a matter of principal.  I am thinking of the next
time I do the job in another 20 years :-)  The socket... err... I have a
big combo wrench that I use and just go for &quot;dying heave&quot; tight on those
nuts.  they are big buggers and can take it :-)  Grease is any competent
front-end grease.  Lithium is good, but this is not a high-temp or
high-speed application, just high pressures so any good grease will do the
job.

&gt; Also, I ordered (Bus Depot) tie rods, all four shocks, all new brake
&gt; pads/shoes and rear clyinders, front brake hoses, plus other stuff. Every
&gt; rubber seal/boot in the front end of this bus is shot. Now I find myself
&gt; wondering if I should do the front wheel bearings and swing lever bushings
&gt; while I'm at it.
&gt;
&gt; 5)Would this make sense? (bearings, swing lever bushings)

This is a definite can of worms.  The more you do, the better your bus
will do, but there has to be a &quot;sanity limit&quot; somewhere.  Certainly  check
them all as they come off, but pace yourself.  If the rest of the front
end is in bad shape, the swing lever is certainly suspect as well.  wheel
bearing are a separate job in my mental catalogue and I would leave them
for another day.

&gt; 6)Finally, any tips for the stabilizer bar clamps? the one with the slide on
&gt; clip. C-clamp maybe?

This is what caused me to write and add my pence...

I have and use a large-jaw Vice Grip 12LC to compress the rubber bushing.
Use lots of penetrating oil, bang the clamp on the side to loosen up the
rust before you attempt to punch it off.  Remember there is a tongue
insice the U, and if you bang on both, nothing is going to happen (ask me
how I know :)  But the biggie is to use the 12LC to compress the bushing.
