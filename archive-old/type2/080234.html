Subject: Re: [T2] black crud coming off my 1970's steering wheel

Going to clean mine with mineral spirits and then a very quick clean with 
lacquer thinner (to remove any oily mineral spirits) and then plan to 
respray using the color that matches my dash.

IF I am correct this should seal the failing steering wheel vinyl / rubber/ 
what-ever-it-is stuff.

I'll update the list on the results. I should be doing this is weekend.

By the way, my grandfather's 1995 Lumina has done something similar.



Ciao!
