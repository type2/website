Subject: Re: [T2] Help with rust hole in 70 camper please

Howard,
Ever weld with a coat hanger?

I have.

It's the strongest, high carbon rod money can't buy.

Back in the stone ages , this all I used for body panel repair-- a torch
a bucket of wet rags , a side cutters and a bunch of coat hanger's.

I can weld with coat hanger so it looks as good as my Mig / Tig welds.

Mig is fast for 1&quot; plate you right, but the tig if your a skilled welder
is as fast, and you get a better weld, because you have more control of
the arc area with it.
Mig welding to sheet metal ( especially rusted out area's ) sometimes
becomes mass air welding---

And by air welding I mean filling caverns  of air after you created with
the mig welder having blown through the paper thin rotten sheet metal.

Or spaghetti welding --loading up the void with a mile of unburnt
wire---Not a strong joint for sure---

The tig set up ( or the coat hanger ) you have more control of the
heated area, and can fill more, faster, and with less warpation ( not
with the torch and the coat hanger ) with the hand held rod.

Been welding since 63'---certified, personified, and mortified.

Done it all.


Take care,.
