Subject: Re: [T2] foam pads or sisal fibre pads for my 70 bug seats?

[...]
at the motorworks show i was talking with one of the vendors on seat 
redoing.  she said that for several  of their setups they actually use 
both.  They use the original vw seat pad and then put a thin foam one on 
top of that.  Another  bus driver  at the show said that was how the 
shop in castlerock that did his did it also.

&gt; OK so gonna order these today, but don't know which to use? I see some
&gt; articles saying foam, others using the sisal. I'd appreciate anyone who 
&gt; has
&gt; actually done this giving me a heads up before I tackle this job. I 
&gt; have the
&gt; TMI interior, a hot sunny day, so I think it's time to put those

&gt; in the sun to loosen them up and quit procrastinating!!!
