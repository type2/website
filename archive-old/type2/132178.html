Subject: Looking for Type 4 pulley/fan bolt and nut

Everything has been going great since my engine install but a few days ago I
noticed an intermittent tapping sound that was tied to the engine rpms. It
would come and go making it hard to locate and I finally realized that one
of the bolts holding the squirrel cage to the pulley was backing out and the
head scraping the inside of the fan shroud.

Lucky the fan can be removed without having to drop the engine any. I must
have forgot to put some loctite on those bolts and in the process of
remedying the situation the bad nut/bolt combo stripped on me. The bolt has
a triple square head but it's much smaller than a cv bolt.

I checked the fiche but low and behold there is no hardware shown attaching
the fan halves together (#4). Parts #11/12/13 look similar but they are
actually the bolts that hold the fan the hub.

Does anyone know a part number for the hardware I'm talking about or better
yet does anyone have the the nut/bolt from a junk fan that they could sell
me? I just need that hardware to get going again...
