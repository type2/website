&gt; I got a question that's been buggin the hell outta me on my 76fi.  What

&gt; that it's getting it's timing from the points, but the points don't tell
&gt; it which cylinder is firing, just when.
&gt; 
&gt; So, do all the injectors open on every cycle of the points opening and
&gt; closing or is there actually some way that the computer is able to know
&gt; which cylinder is going to fire a particular time, therefore opening
&gt; that respective injector.

The injector doesn't synch with the cylinders.  The open/closed time ratio
is varied to set the mixture by vibrating the valve open and closed, but
the fuel simply accumulates in the manifold until the intake valve opens.
