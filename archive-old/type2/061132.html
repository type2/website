&gt;Scott,
&gt;  If you don't mind, tell me a little more about the bilge blower fan.
&gt;Any info would be appreciated...

Well, Pete and listees,
 I tought I would make this a general post due to the fact that with 
winter here there has been a lot of buzz about blowers and heater 
improvements. There are two articals in the type2_dot_com library, but one 
uses a different type of blower and the other does not give a lot of 
detail on the installation of the Attwood tunnel type blower.
First is a list of things that you will need:
1 Attwood turbo 3000 tunnel type bilge blower 3in or simular
Duct tape or metal foil tape
Switch ( a stock Bus dome light switch or headlight switch looks the 
best)
Wire and connectors
Cutting device e.g.   hacksaw,sawzall,zipsaw,diegrinder,cut off saw, or 
even a dremel
Optional is a relay and inline fuse
   Fisrt thing to do is to remove the skid plate under the front of the 
bus. Then locate the heater tube that comes from the back of the bus to 
the front and goes up to the defroster. Hold the blower up in a mock 
position to locate the best spot in the tube for it. Then mark with a 
pencil where the cut needs to be. Then use what ever method you have 
available to cut out the peice of pipe. I had a zip saw, like a small 
sawzall that worked great but it is a tight spot to work in non the 
less. With the pipe section removed test fit the blower in place. If it 
fits attach a wire to the black wire on the blower and find a sutable 
ground. then attach to the yellow (or what ever your fans power wire is) 
wire and run it up through a hole in the floor (there are many to choose 
from, no need to drill). now put the blower in position and tape around 
it to hold it in place. If you want, the blowers have feet on them that 
you could make a bracket to mount to, but I just used the tape and it 
hold just fine. I also installed a little insulation aroud the pipe and 
blower to keep things warm and used the zip ties supplied with the 
blower. Put the skid plate back on and go inside the Bus. Find the wire 
that you pushed up thruogh the floor and bring it up to the dash routing 
it out of the way. The stock Bus dash has many holes drilled in it in 
line with the switches that are allready there. Feel behind the dash at 
the bottom and you will feel the holes, they are just covered with the 
vinyl. Choose a hole and cut out the vinyl. I used a stock dome light 
switch from a parts Bus and it looks like the factory put it there. So 
take the wire from the blower and attach it to the switch. Find a power 
source at the fuse block and run a wire from the fuse block to the 
switch. Make sure that the terminal you choose can support the 2.6 amps 
that the blower requires and you attach to the fused side.
  The results are wonderful. I can feel air flow all the way to the top 
of the windshield and it clears the whole thing all the way to the 
rubber seal and even a little on the side windows. Lots more air flow! I 
now can see where I'm going.
  The only draw back to this set up is that the blower is loud, but I've 
found that I only need to run it for short times mainly when I fist get 
in and then I can turn it off after about 5 to 10 minutes depending on 
the weather. Then only turn it back on when needed.
  Some options to make it a little better are to use a headlight switch 
or a windshield wiper switch. This would allow you to put a resistor in 
line and have two or three speeds and that would reduce the noise when 
only a little boost is needed. Some of you may want to install the relay 
and run a big long wire from the battery and just use the dash switch to 
trigger the relay, it up to you.
  I have run mine full blast with the headlights on and the wipers going 
and turnsignals blinking with no smoke, hot wires or any other problems, 
but I don't guarentee this will work for you ( I take no liability). But 
I don't see why it would not unless you hook it up wrong or try to use 
too small of wire or hook to too small of power source.
   The time involved was about an hour give or take and I will do it to 
any bus I ever own. Not as much heat as a Gas heater but much less 
expensive and I feel more comfortable with it (no flames involved).
      Well I hope this help everyone stay warm and see the road ahead, 
safe and warm is posible in a Bus, It just takes a little effort on our 
part.
  Good Luck and Happy Bussing.
