Subject: Re: [T2] hi temp powder coating?

High temperature powdercoat (and most all the others )
generally bake at around 400 F for 10-20 minutes.
When the parts are cool, they are as done as they will ever be.

&gt; Tony,
&gt;
&gt; You would point that out wouldn't you&lt;grin&gt;....it didn't say...I am hoping
&gt; that it is the standard 400 degrees and it finishes when you actually have
&gt; it on the car getting hotter...sort of like the por-15 header stuff..
