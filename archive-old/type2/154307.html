Subject: VW Photos 

Hi All

I am starting to put a small 2007 VW calendar together from some of my photos
over the last year, and would appreciate any feedback on the 12 images to
use.

I have set up a simple web page with about 21 images on it with tick boxes
next to the photos and a send button.(no emails required)

If anyone is inclined I would be grateful for there opinions.

thanks in advance

Peter Gibney
