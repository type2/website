&gt; Oh great - my 73 Westy knows I am about to leave on a 2 week trip to
&gt; Mexico...Yesterday I took rotated the rear suspension torsion bars one
&gt; splign to adjust my ride height back to normal...after bolting everything
&gt; back together, I noticed a vibration under power in 2nd &amp; 3rd gears...when I
&gt; make a RH turn under power I get the pluc-a-tah, pluc-a-tah noise from the
&gt; RH side...I removed the RH half shaft and checked both CV joints, thinking I
&gt; had 'dropped' a ball or something without knowing...everything looked
&gt; OK...pulled the brake drum and wheel carrier (by the way an 1-13/16&quot; x 3/4
&gt; drive socket fits the axle nut just right) to peek at the outer hub
&gt; bearing...looked a little dry in there, but I didn't go any further until I
&gt; can get some new bearings &amp; seals...the shaft has a little movement, so new
&gt; bearings will probably be in order (140K miles) anyway...My local guru tells
&gt; me that type2's almost never have rear wheel bearing problems...
&gt; 
&gt; My real question is, why did the noise start now?...all I did to adjust the
&gt; torsion bars was to remove the shocks, unbolt the brake line, unbolt the hub
&gt; assembly from the spring plate - do the spline thing, and put everything
&gt; back together....any ideas, anyone...if I had a worn CV joint, would it only
&gt; make thumping noise in a turn like this, or would it thump any time when
&gt; power was applied??...also, if you get off the power in a RH turn, the
&gt; thumping quits...and it doesn't thump in a LH turn or straight ahead, except
&gt; for the vibration mentioned above...any suggestions would be greatly
&gt; accepted from the many experts out there that may have run into similar
&gt; symptoms...thanks.

Ray:
What, ain't it warm enough in Stockton? Wishin' I was in Stockton cause
2 weeks ago it was -22F here in Iowa. Much warmer now though.
I'd say 80% chance it's the CV joint. Changing the ride height and
turning corners (with its attendant change in joint angle proves too
much for the wear or possibly just dry grease). I agree with your local
guru nothing else hardly ever goes wrong. One other thing- you did get
the nut (BIG nut) tight didn't you-with only a 3-foot pipe cheater bar I
dont think you could get it too tight. Oh, I'm re-thinking what you
said, you didn't take the stub axle loose at first, right? Then I'll
stick with the CV joint. I've prolonged the life of dying CV's by 20-30
thousan miles by cutting a small incision in the boot and spraying
around inside with spray grease. I figured I had nothing to lose- I
think the joints usually outlast the boots in our climate.
