&gt;I just purchased a 67 double cab, the truck is scruffy, but will be a great
work vehicle.  The problem is, the steering is really sloppy, like 1/2 turn
before anything happens.  The relay arm is very loose in its mount.  How is
something like this repaired?

You have to pull the old bushing, put in a new one, and ream it to fit.  I'm
assuming by &quot;relay arm&quot; you mean the pivot point on the beam.  The drag
links also will end up with play in them.
