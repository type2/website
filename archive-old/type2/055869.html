anyway, here i am and i am indeed happy. with the old tranny and
mismatched redux boxes (doh!), i felt comfortable cruising on the
highway at about 55. my only indicator being engine noise, tranny whine,
and pedal. no fancy guages on my stock dash :-) anyway, now it seems
real comfy somewhere between 60 and 65. feels like there's still a bit
of room up there too, but this is fine with me :-)  got a bunch of other
stuff done while i was at it too. this is the best my bus has felt since
i got her. got a feeling this is contageous :-)

congrats on getting it sorted out.  hope it wasn't too slimy.

But a couple things:

If you have 64-67 brakes in the rear  and the earlier ones in the front it is
not matched properly and can cause problem.  However, having mismatched brakes
on the same axle is -really- screwball at at least that's not going on
anymore.     Even though it's a PITA, you should think about a later front end
or getting earllier gear boxes on your bus.

I'm sure the 67 trans is geared higher than the one you took out of the bus,
but It probably isn't geared to do 65mph.  Maybe you can borrow a tach and
figure out your rpms?  I keep meaning to do that myself, but I don't drive 65.
And did you check the tarnny boots on the 'new' tranny?   Make sure they are
good.  Also change your tranny oil in a couple hundred miles,  center section
and gear boxes, and clean the magnetic plugs.  Do it again if it didn't come
out pretty clean.     Sometimes there is a lot of crud and or/water in there.
If it sat somewhere a long time there can be rust above the oil level, and
settled gunk below, which gets stirred up into the oil with use, and can
abrade the gear surfaces.  I drain it after I drive it, so the oil is mixed up
and warm, so it drains quicker.   I like the slick 50 tranny additive, which
does help quiet gear noise, which can only be good and indicates to me less
friction (wear) is going on.   I use that in the final oiling of the tranny-
usually it gets changed more than once unless the PO was anal retentive about
changing the fluids, which is unfortunately very unusual.

my 3 cents
