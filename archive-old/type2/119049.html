Subject: Optima charging requirements

Could someone comment as to the correctness of my understanding of the
discussion on regulators?:

1. The original Bosch voltage regulator and generator in my 70 bus will not
provide the proper charging required to properly maintain  an Optima/dry
cell battery.
2. A  solid state regulator will allow an alternator equipped bus (72 and
later) to properly charge a dry cell/Optima.
3. A solid state regulator cannot be used with a generator to properly
charge an Optima.

&gt; If you've really stepped up to the plate, as I did, and have opted for
&gt; the spiral-wound, &quot;starved electrolyte&quot; type of battery, then those bad
&gt; boys require an even higher charging voltage than the sealed or
&gt; maintenance-free batteries..... I have seen, but not used, the Bosch
&gt; solid-state VR that looks just like the old-school
&gt; &quot;dumber-than-a-sackfull-of-hammers&quot; Bosch VR.  Same external can, same
&gt; plug arrangement on the bottom, but pop them open, and it's different
&gt; world inside - .....  If you're
&gt; doing a daily driver, and want the utmost in reliability using more
&gt; modern bits and pieces, then our friend David has provided us one way to
&gt; achieve that goal -  a big &quot;List thank you&quot; to David, and for providing
&gt; the Wells part number (VR650)-.....
