Subject: I need a part and the bus depot doesn't have it!

Hello all - 
   
  I have determined my auxillary air regulator is shot, and I need a new one.  Unfortunately the bus depot doesn't have it!  
   
  Any suggestions on where else I could get one?  Anyone got a spare?  :)
   
  It's for a 2.0 Aircooled 81 Vanagon.
   
  Thanks.
   
  Marc
