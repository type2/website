I was thinking about your problem, since I have the same thing onmy bus. 
What about putting some aluminum fol on the end of the contacts of the bulb 
(basically shove some in there. Would that work? Is that a hazard? Or maybe 
solder some wire of something on the end of the contact, basically to extend 
the length of the bulb so it makes contact with the socket.
OK, maybe not the cleanest way of repairing...I guess the most 'efficient' 
way to do that would be to buy a new assembly. Is that efficient, really? 
Cleaning, as suggested by others would be good to, but if all that doesn't 
work, does anybody have any suggestions about adding foil/wire/something to 
the bulb length?

&gt;ok, i've got my tail lights ['71 westy] more or less working again, &gt;but 
&gt;the problem with them seems to be flaky bulb sockets on both &gt;sides. the 
&gt;bulbs lock into the bayonet socket, but they're not very
&gt;firmly held in place. if you push in on the bulb a little too much,
&gt;the spring loaded contacts don't push the bulb into the bayonet. i
&gt;don't really see how these can be repaired, since it's a small
&gt;internal part. i'm thinking at this point that maybe i just need to &gt;buy 
&gt;new tail light assemblies, which should have firmer sockets.

&gt;before i order this, does anyone know of a trick to retension the &gt;springs? 
&gt;i couldn't see how this thing would come apart to do it
&gt;myself.
