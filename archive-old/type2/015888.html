&gt;&gt;Not so -- that's more like what it should be for a T1 upright engine, not

&gt;Gotta disagree with that one.  An 009 will hit max advance way below 3500
&gt;(ie about 2700 - 2800).  I don't know what the advance curve is with a stock
&gt;dizzy, but every long-term bus and/or 914 mechanic I've talked to is
&gt;emphatic that anything over 32 degrees with an 009 is a no-no.  I've been
&gt;running mine on my dual-Weber-ed 1.7/1.8 hybrid (don't ask) for 8
&gt;years/70,000 miles and I know it is right.  
&gt;
&gt;Anyone else want to offer an opinion, cold-hard fact, or experience on this
&gt;issue?  

Okay, I agree with Harmon.  My bus has gone tens of thousands of miles with
about 44 degrees total advance (not sure exactly since it's off the scale).
 I'm sure an 009 cannot supply this much advance unless you set it to
something like 15 or more degrees BTDC initial (which is way too much).
The 009 supplies much less total timing advance than the stock dual vacuum
unit (albeit at earlier rpm).  This is because the dual vacuum unit
provides advance not just one but three ways - from mechanical advance,
vacuum advance, and vacuum retard.  Yes, the retard effectively supplies
advance since you go from full retard at idle to full advance at WOT (Wide
Open Throttle).  Now how much would you pay?  

I once backed my timing down to where I had 36 degrees total advance and it
ran like a three-legged dog.  Also ran an 009 for a while - hated it.  Flat
spot.  Tried everything to get rid of it.  Went back to stock dizzy, flat
spot went away - it was like a breath of fresh air.  Never again an 009 in
my engine.  IMO they belong in old, old type 1 engines only, just like VW
says.

Reading back over what you said, Mike, I think you guys are talking about
different things.  I agree with you also when you say anything more than 32
degrees timing with an 009 is a no-no.  That's because you would have too
much initial timing (at idle) with more than 32 degrees total advance.  I
also agree with Harmon who says that the type IV needs at least 40 degrees
total advance.  I would venture to guess that you are losing a significant
amount of horsepower in your engine from lack of advance.  If you ever put
your bus on a dyno, take along a stock distributor and I'll bet you lunch
you will gain power running the 40 degrees total advance that you would get
with the stock unit over the 32 degrees you have now with your 009.  Or,
just bump your 009 way up during the test since you'll only be running at
WOT anyway.  Your bus idles nicely and accelerates well, but I bet you are
losing a bunch of power from lack of advance.
