Subject: Further to: Strange Cylinder Wear


&gt; Mates,
&gt;
&gt; For anyone who can help, I've posted two pictures of the offending
&gt; weirdness.
&gt;
&gt; http://home.earthlink_dot_net/~jlsmi11/cylinder1.jpg

Are you meaning the cut-out on the bottom edge of the cylinder? One side is
long and square, the other a half-moon?

&gt; http://home.earthlink_dot_net/~jlsmi11/cylinder2.jpg

Now I am a little confused. Seeing this pic I didn't see anything wrong.
Then I reread your original message. Is what you are looking at the cut out
for the rod to clear the bottom edge of cylinder as the crank turns?

Do you have a 68-79 Bentley?  If yes: go to section 5, page 44, figure 13-3.
There is nothing wrong. That is the way they are made.

&gt;
&gt; Trusted listees,
&gt;
&gt; First, let me say that I know little if anything about identifying
&gt; cylinder/piston wear.
&gt; Now, in the ever-so-long process of rebuilding my 78 2.0 litre, I pulled
the
&gt; cylinders today from both of my donor engines.  All EIGHT cylinders had
the
&gt; following strange condition:
&gt;
&gt; On the &quot;sleeve&quot; of the cylinder, one side of the circle is what appears to
&gt; be a machined half-rectangle.  Directly across from it is a moon-shaped,
&gt; semi-circular groove which does not appear to be normal....  All the
&gt; cylinders have varying degrees of this half-moon.
&gt;
&gt; Can anyone help?  Is this a normal machine process or is it a sign of
wear?
&gt; If so, are the pistons (about which I'm equally ignorant) inherently
&gt; faulted?
&gt; Considering the somewhat exorbitant price of cylinder/piston sets...
uuggh.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for any help!
