Subject: Bus folks need help in USA

Volks... as some may recall, and some may know them.... Richard and Gayle 
Millar from South Africa are touring the USA in a '79 FI Westy... the &quot;Yankee 
Pumba Wagen&quot;.

Well, they are broke down in Rapid City, South Dakota... no compression on 
#4... they are currently in the parking lot of the place that will work on 
the bus, but the shop is full up til Wed to work on the bus.  Richard phoned 
me asking if there were any Type 2 members close by... the only AIRS person 
is on the east side of the state.  Richard is wondering if anyone would have 
the room to host them, instead of living out of the bus in the parking lot of 
the garage there in Rapid City for the holiday weekend.  He isn't asking for 
any parts or mechanical help at the moment, just looking to share some laughs 
and probably a cold beer.... it could get kinda lonely in the parking lot for 
the next four days.

These are good bus folks, a lot of fun.  If any of ya all are in the area, or 
have friends that would like to entertain a pair of bus folks from South 
Africa, drop me a line.  Richard will be calling back here tomorrow morning 
to see if I have heard any info.

All help greatly honored.
