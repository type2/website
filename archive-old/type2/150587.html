&amp;gt; FWIW, you can get any rotor cross-drilled through several aftermarket

&amp;gt; and Automobile). This would make a HUGE difference in performance for a
&amp;gt; reasonable price.

Please define &amp;quot;HUGE&amp;quot;.

Sorry to be a stick in the mud, but the reason for cross-drilling if to
produce slightly improved performance with cold brakes in wet conditions.
The holes allow water to escape quicker and prevents the pads from
&amp;quot;hydroplaning&amp;quot; on the disc surface.

I've experienced this phenomenon on a motorcycle with undrilled rotors
and it was rather disconcerting.  The solution was to simply keep the
front disc warm by dragging the brake a bit.

I've never experienced this on a car, though.  The pad forces and
protected location of the brakes make it a lot harder to get the disc wet.

What I have seen with drilled rotors is rather uneven wear.  Cross-drill
your rotors and figure on turning them with every set of pads.  Otherwise,
new pads won't seat correctly.

Cross-drilling will have a tiny effect on cooling.  The holes just don't
add that much surface area to the discs.

I think a better solution is simply to drive slower.  It's a bus, not a
911!
