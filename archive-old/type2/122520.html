&gt; I don't think any engine is 100% tight (0% leakage), although someone
&gt; please correct me if I am wrong.

Engines aren't designed to be 100% tight at the rings.

&gt; I seem to recall that 10% leakage is
&gt; generally acceptable running condition for non-rebuilt engines of the
&gt; 72-79 vintage (I think I gleaned that from Wilson's rebuild book).

- newly built should be around 5%
- good running condition about 10% or less
- 20% means engine has seen many miles
- 30-90% indicates majors problems

And race engines have even higher standards.
