&gt; &lt;&lt; s there a replacement for this that does not involve cloth covered rubber. 
&gt;  Do they make steel covered fuel lines?  I'd like to replace it with 
&gt; something a bit more rugged since it sits near hot heat exchangers and the 
&gt; engine. &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Pop down to the local &quot;speed shop&quot; and replace everything with braided 
&gt; stainless steel and fittings...'Spensive, but you only have to do it once.
&gt; Look up &quot;Racer Wholesale&quot;, also for catalog.


I got mine from a comercial vehicle hydraulic repair shop/wholesaler. they
sold me &quot;roll ends&quot; fairly cheaply (still over $1 a foot)

a piece I took off to examine looked brand new inside and out after 8
years of use,  this stuff has multi thousand pound presure ratings
