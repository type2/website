Subject: Re: [T2] Electrical problems 70 bus

Hi Martin,

Welcome to the list!

&gt; He also has a switch he was using to
&gt; operate the wipers so I'm assuming
&gt; the switch for the wipers in the
&gt; steering column went bad. 

You say you have a 1970 bus. In that year the bus
still had a Switch on the dashboard to operate the
windshieldwipers. The switch on the steering column
was introduced with modelyear 1972 (august 1971).
  
&gt; The next day, I turned the key and
&gt; the warning lights in the dash come
&gt; on in  the first position, but in the
&gt; start position I get 1 click from the 
&gt; soleniod and nothing. 

This might indicate a bad contact between wires. Check
if the big red wires on your solenoid are making good
contact. I had one of them loose last summer, I had
the same symptoms (no electricity in the car
whatsoever).

If the contact is weak then you can get power when you
turn the key the key to 'contact' but as soon as you
ask more by starting the engine the contact gets too
much power I guess and doesn't pass on any electricity
anymore.

Also check the battery contacts.

I see your name is 'Van Tassel', are you from The
Netherlands?
