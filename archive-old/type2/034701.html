Subject: Westy T-molding

I replaced some of dryed up/shrunk T-molding on my '79 Westy last weekend. I
noticed that there are two different types in use on my Westy. There is a
thin plastic T-molding on my side cabinet rear, and side cabinet 3 open oval
storage areas. These are the parts I replaced. The counter-top covering the
stove has a different, thicker rubber T-molding. 

Do you other Westy folks have plastic T-molding where I do?
Does anyone know of a source for the rubber T-molding?

I got my plastic T-molding from the Woodworkers Store (see my post from Mar
1998, search on &quot;molding and Hoare&quot;). This plastic T-molding worked great
for my '79 Westy, it is a hair wider than the original (1/32&quot; or so), but it
fits great and looks much better than my old stuff. I just hope it holds up
to the heat cycles.... only time will tell.
