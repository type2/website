Subject: OIL PRESSURE???

--part1_ad.21a109b7.2a8885a6_boundary

Hey out there...
This post has nothing to do with a van...but I hope I can ask anyway...it 
does have to do with a VW motor...I have a VW trike...it has I think a 1972 
beatle engine...somewhere around that year...anyway...I rebuild the engine 
last year...finally got it running...I hooked up a oil pressure guage...it 
seems when the engine is idling the guage drops to 0 ...but it sounds great 
...the motor that is...runs great also...now when I'm driving along...the 
guage reads anywhere from 10 to 35 .._dot_depending on the RPM's...is this 
normal?...bad guage? ...what are the specs.for oil pressure ?...any help will 
be appreciated...just for the records...I do drive a 80 vanagon ...and 
restoring a 78 transporter :) ...
thanks a bunch ...
