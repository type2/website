X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL - A

Monte in SD asked me for one of the surplus .009 dizzies I have here at the 
house.
I am sending him off a cleaned and rebuilt .009.

My cousin and I have the dizzy box out and emptied on the work bench as I 
type........
We are cleaning them all up today, and putting them in working order.

A couple of others on the list out there asked me for a couple of the vac 
advance ones I have.

So I do not have to search my archives filed away to find who you 
were.............
Who were you, and please send me your mail address.

Will get them off this week.
