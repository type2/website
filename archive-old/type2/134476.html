Subject: Re: [T2] What exactly does a CO screw adjust?

Marc said:

 I have an 81 Vanagon that is still running too rich.  I was thinking of playing with the CO screw, but I
don't really know what it does, and I like to understand things before I monkey with them.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Too rich over the whole rpm range is usually caused by either a bad #3 cyl head temp sensor or no vacuum to
the fuel pressure regulator or a leaky diaphragm in the fuel pressure regulator and fuel is being sucked into
the intake.
