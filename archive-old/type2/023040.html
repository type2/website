Perhaps, but I've had the same wire running under my bus since I put the 
gauge in about twelve years ago.  The insulation has stiffened and cracked 
a little at the end but otherwise it is in good shape, and I've done my 
fair share of rough-roading in the bus.  The wire does not hang down below 
sump level.

&gt;I was referring to a type 1 engine and the readings are different between
&gt;the dipstick/sump senders.

I guess I missed that point - my apologies.  The majority of discussion on 
this list is about the type 4 and occasionally I am caught assuming it.

&gt;Does the 914 sender stick up an inch or so into
&gt;the sump?

Yes, at least an inch into the main sump.  The sender is actually mounted 
in a recession so it will reach up further (and presumably be more out of 
the way).
