Subject: Re: [T2] very frustrating electrical problem

I think I figured it out too, but my conclusion was different than 
yours.  I noticed that when charging, the voltage was not as high as I've 
seen in other vehicles.  I found that the stock mechanical regulator over 
time was cutting out at a lower voltage than it should due to gradual 
fatigue of the moving parts it is made up of.  The net result was less 
juice going into the battery than was needed to keep it charged on short 
trips or with other electrical loads placed upon the system.  A properly 
working electrical system should recharge the battery after a typical start 
within 60 seconds.

The solution is to replace the stock regulator with one of the new 
generation solid-state electronic regulators.  Charging voltage will rise 
and your battery will maintain it's charge level more easily.  The need to 
charge occasionally with shore power will be eliminated.

Note that there is no free lunch - the extra power is being delivered by 
the alternator, which means that it will run a bit hotter than 
before.  Shouldn't matter with a good alternator but if yours is marginal, 
it might push it over the edge.  Pure theory - I only bring it up because 
my ooriginal alternator which had worked well for a dozen years or more 
failed sometime after I upgraded the regulator - maybe within a 
year?  Can't remember exactly.  Can't say it's because of the regulator or 
not, but it might have been a contributing factor.  Replaced the alternator 
with a Bosch rebuilt and have had no trouble since.  If the newer regulator 
does put more stress on the alternator, it's not more than it was 
originally designed for, so I don't worry and neither should you.  The new 
regulator is at Autozone and is under $20.  Made by Wells.  Looks different 
but works the same.  Here's what it did for my electrical system (2500rpm):

                         Old regulator    New Regulator

Engine running no load       13.1           14.1
Engine running w/lights      12.6           13.9
Engine, lights, wipers       12.4           13.8

As you can see, with the old regulator not much charging was going 
on.  With the new regulator, lots of charging going on.  I throw this 
modification into the &quot;One of the best things I've ever done for my bus&quot; bin.

&lt;!sarcasm&gt;
Of course, if you'd rather pay $100 for a NOS Bosch mechanical regulator so 
you can experience this joy all over again a few years from now, be my 
guest.  You can be content knowing that you applied DM (Dumme Methode) and 
are somehow superior because of it, even though your bus won't start.  :)
