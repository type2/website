Subject: Help needed with 'new-fangled' '75 Breadloaf!!!

Hey all:

        As the subject indicates, I have a few questions with respect
to one of 'dem 'der new-fangled type-iv transporters...But they're 20
years old you say...Ah, yes!  However, one must remember that the
'newest' type-II I have ever owned is my current '66 Westy...hence, I
feel justified in the &quot;new-fangled&quot; term. ;)

The situation is that the brother of one of my friends has a '75 Westy
in which he has toasted the engine...[and to think that my friend had
given him a copy of St-Muir for Xmas last year].  Anyhow, Bill [the
fellow with the bus] was quite willing to let it go, but his SO
'insisted' that they replace the engine...so I have been asked to
intervene.  Now, Bill didn't know what was in it for an engine...and
since he is living in BC, I cannot check...from what I can remember,
they cam stock with an 1800cc type-iv...wasn't this the first year for
fuel-injection as well [D-tronic]?

So I am looking for places/prices on a new type-iv...either complete
or long-block [Bill doesn't know what parts off the old engine are
still any good...so I am arranging for someone to venture up to
Gibsons and have a boo for I].  If the fuel-injection, etc are still
in good shape, he will be in the market for an 1800 long block.  If it
looks like a complete engine is required, then he is open to either an
1800 or 2.0l as a replacement.  

The catch is that they do not have large quantities of cash at their
disposal as they are in the midst of starting a new business [for
which they had originally purchased the breadloaf]. If it was an
upright he was looking for, I could ship him one...:(  

To make this growing saga short [Ha!], I am looking for a good
condition 'stock' 1800-2.0l type-iv [preferably on the West coast] to
ship to Gibsons, BC.  The catch is that Bill has only about $1000 to
spend [I know this would get him a rebuilt 1600dp...but am unsure of
the price of a rebuilt type-iv].  Can you wizards out there recommend
to I the &quot;best bang-for-your-buck&quot; in terms of quality place(s) that
rebuild type-iv's [or if anyone has one they would like to sell]?

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Splits...Oh, my!

Roy
