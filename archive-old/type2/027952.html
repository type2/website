&gt;Last night, I discovered an unconnected wire dangling about in the engine
&gt;compartment (recent rebuild).  It is grey, the unconnected-end has a
&gt;three-prong attachment (bent, incidentally), and it appears to be attached
&gt;to something below the air intake distributor, to the firewall (tin).  I
can
&gt;only reach it by jamming my hand beneath the AFM and snaking towards (&amp;
&gt;below) the gas tank.

I have it too!!  I really don't have a clue though.  I found a &quot;mate&quot; (ie
the other end) for it on Friday when I was trying to get the fridge working
(which I did), so plugged it in.  No idea what it does though.  Didn't
notice anything different with it connected.  I don't have Bettie here, but
next time I'm working on her I'll try to trace the other end.  Maybe
something to do with the camper conversion?  It looks kinda original though
the way its mounted through the firewall
