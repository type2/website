&gt;If you didn't touch the distributor, then leave it alone for now.
 
I agree, you'll feel stupid when you find the simple anwer.

I took off all the vacuum hoses last week for my diagram and when I put them back on I couldn't start. On my second start attempt no oil or alt light came on. I freaked for a second, then when I calmed down I remembered that I messed with the battery ground strap. It must have been insulated by a bit of paint . I made sure it made a good connection and the engine started up.

Be systematic and eliminate the easy ones.
