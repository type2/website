Shannon,

The problem is that every year is different.  Below, is a short summary of
differences I know of.  It is not complete but is what I know.  Others are
invited to add any points I missed/didn't know (like when the trapezoid
port/triangle port switch happened)

No differences:
72

minimal differences:

You can install any '72-74 engine.  Same case, same dual carbs.  But you
will need to figure differences in things like smog pumps, charcoal
filters, etc. (never owned one and not an expert here, but smog pumps
frighten me :-)

Do-able, slightly more differences:

The '75-78 engine will also fit.  Same case, different exhaust, different
flywheel, and it came with FI.  Installing FI instead of carbs is a bit of
a job, but can be done (I know, I've done it) and has certain advantages.  
Or you can keep your dual carbs, but they are a bit small for a 2L engine.
Or you can install a weber progressive or dual delorto's (not cheap).
Also the exhaust differences... You can install the '72 exhaust, or go
with the later exhaust, but must have a complete one of whichever you
choose, as they have no parts in common.

Possible: 
The 79-82.5 case will fit, but you will need to modify/swap a
couple major bits.  the biggest is that you either need to go with the
later heads, with the square exhaust ports and the associated exhaust
system or switch heads to your oval port heads and use your old exhaust
system.  Also, the mounting points for the rear hanger, V'gon uses M12
Bolts, loaf uses M10.

Lastly:

European buses used the 1600DP engine all the way thru the 70's and you
can install one here, *if* you get a set of the tin, which is *very*
different from the tin you have.  You will also need the correct
&quot;moustache bar&quot; to support the rear, and will live in fear of emissions
inspections/vigilant safety inspectors for the rest of time.  This in not
applicable in all states/countries, but no one is loosening standards and
what passes this year may not pass next year :-(
