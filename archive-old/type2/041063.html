Subject: Ohio VW Shows

Hello to all of you folks that live in Ohio. I have a free plane ticket
that runs out mid July, and since I have never been to Ohio thought this
might be a good opportunity to see a VW show and knock Ohio off my list
of states to visit, only 11 to go.

So....... which show would any of you suggest, the one that is June 27,
or the one that is July 1-2 ?

Also any one want to help house and provided a show buddy to me when I'm
there? I could stay at a local Hotel but think meeting new VW folks
would be neat, of course I will pay any expenses needed.

Even though the name is usually for females, I am a 36 year old male,
none smoking, social drinker, so I know that knocks out about 50 guys.
But if you wouldn't mind a South Carolina fellow Busser coming and
visiting for a few days, please let me know.

Thank You!
Meredith

P.S. Even if no one can offer a sleeping place and a buddy, which is the
better show to go to?
