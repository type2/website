hey all
I know all of you live 1K miles away from me...or it seems... but there
are a few around here.
I have one bay window bench seat - middle - black, and 2 full length
bench seats - bay - one black - one tan...all are rather nice...but the
tan one has the infamous &quot;stains&quot; that it gets from the sun...
If anyone wants these give me a hollar as they are taking up a lot of
room in my garage/bus.

best offer...I will ship...but not pay for the shipping ;)

later
