Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Sliding door seal

Unless you have a one piece molded seal and are offended by the following
comment....
Cut the seal or open it at a corner if its a glued 4 piece aftermarket
one.
I glue the seal in with weatherstrip adhesive anyway so its no more work
to reglue the open spot.
Ive found that the seals usually need to be stretched a bit so I glue with
black weatherstrip adhesive and tape it in place until dry so it stays
put.
Ive never used an expensive german or nos seal. If I did I might be more
inclined to do it the good (hard) way. maybe...


&gt; Another option, which seems to work without requiring support or a helper,
&gt; is to undo the support at the top-leading edge of the door.  While holding
&gt; the door, tilt it out slightly, slip your seal in, and re-attach the
&gt; support.
&gt;
&gt; Hi Chris,
&gt;
&gt; The easiest way to fit the sliding door seal is to undo the two bolts that
&gt; hold the rear sliding hinge mechanism onto the door (these are to be seen
&gt; from INSIDE of the bus just below the window).
&gt; Then with the door ajar, WHILE SUPPORTING THE DOOR (bloks, axle stand, jack,
&gt; helper...), pull the hinge mechanism out, pop the seal through the gap,
&gt; slide the hinge back into the door.
&gt; In my experience this is much easier than removing the track cover and
&gt; takeing the slider off of the track.
