I am in the process of restoring a 71' Campmobile and I am in need of a new sliding door the door I have is full of fiberglass and bondo. I am also in the need of getting a fold down bed in the back. I have one right now but it is for a 76' and does not fit right so I would be willing to trade beds if you have one. I have many other 76' Campmobile accessories like stove. ice box and heater. If anyone is interested in them. I am in the Northern, iL area. Also if anyone has any pics of there Buses please send them so I can get some ideas from them.

Dan
