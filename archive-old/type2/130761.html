Subject: Double-Relay wiring (was Re: [T2] VW's take on tires...)

Hi David,

Great idea, I was thinking that this would be a good idea for those 
with electrical fuel pumps.

Here are the pin-outs for the double relay:

85 -  Ground
86 - Therno time switch
86a - Starter
86b - AFM Vane Switch wire #36
86c - Ignition switch (+ coil power)
88a - AFM Vane switch wire #39
88b - Resistor Pack
88c - Aux Air regulator
88d - Fuel Pump
88y - Battery
88z - Battery

88y and 88z are powered from the same wire to the battery.

I would suggest you use a ~$5 12V relay so that it connects 86b and 88a 
when it senses voltage on the blue alternator wire.  This will simulate 
the operation of the AFM vane switch. The end result will be that the 
double relay will send power to the fuel pump when a signal is rec'd 
from the starter, and will continue to power the fuel pump as soon as 
the alternator spins up. If the alternator stops spinning, the fuel 
pump will die.

This will also turn off the fuel pump in the event that a fan belt 
breaks, which is not necessarily a bad thing.

This is an affordable safety feature for those who have an FI bus 
already weberized in a less-than-completely-safe fashion.

Happy trails,

&gt; As I was sorting out some parts in preparation for a trip, I 
&gt; discovered two double relays in a box of spare parts from the same PO. 
&gt; I would like to wire one of these so that the electric fuel pump 
&gt; automatically turns off when the engine turns off. I'd appreciate 
&gt; advice, not judgement (no, I wouldn't have gotten rid of the FI if it 
&gt; had been my choice).
