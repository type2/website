&gt;
&gt;Personal note.
&gt;     I had a good friend discover his bus was on fire while he was stopped 
&gt;at
&gt;a light.  Turns out the auxillary blower shorted and started to melt wires,
&gt;which then ignited spilled oil around the filler tube.  No major damage or
&gt;explosions, but his AFM and most of his engine wiring harness were
&gt;destroyed....  I can only image what would happen if the fire had burned 
&gt;for
&gt;much longer.  Which is why everyone should carry a fire extinguisher in
&gt;their bus.  I keep mine in the slot under the drivers seat(always close at
&gt;hand and usually&quot;hopefully&quot; far from the fire.  Another point to make about
&gt;fire safety is to keep your fuel ring up off the tin surface.  Of course
&gt;this relates to my 78 transporter and YMMV.  Maybe there is a flame
&gt;retardant coating that could be applied to high pressure fuel lines that
&gt;could delay tragedy.  Any thoughts??

&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; And another note, aren't most of the first in VW busses caused by 
&gt;old,
&gt; &gt; cracked
&gt; &gt; fuel lines?  If you change your lines, what else would cause a fire?  
&gt;just
&gt; &gt; curious?
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Any number of electrical sources for fires back there. Loose wires
&gt;shorting...
&gt; &gt; battery not bolted down, etc. Add some old spilled oil and you could 
&gt;have
&gt; &gt; enough
&gt; &gt; of a start to cook a fuel line and really BBQ your VW...
