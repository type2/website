&lt;&lt; But keep one thing in

mind.. When an insurance company totals a car, they do so because it is

cheaper than fixing it.. That doesn't mean it cannot be done.  Jan B &gt;&gt;

There's another reason for &quot;totaling&quot; a car...the title. You or I may 
be attached to a car (I've got a Morgan &quot;basket case&quot; spread through-
out my house and garage), and spend the time and money to bring it
back, but the next buyer would/should know that. Lots of cars are
totaled and suffer unsafe damage to frame/structural components,
but are rebuilt. Fires and floods are other causes for changes on 
titles. The problem comes in when unscrupulous resellers &quot;wash&quot;
the title to remove the notification. This would be worth knowing
on a 2 or 3 year old car and certainly would affect my decision to 
either purchase a car or not. On a '71 bus or Wildcat (or '62 Mor-
gan), again, I'd prefer that I knew the history...
A buddy of mine bought some cheap wheels a while ago (a twenty-
something year old Ford van with low miles) to use as a work truck.
It had been hit by a falling tree limb years before; totaled by the in-
surance company (this time because of cost, as you said), but re-
paired and in use. The problems came up about a year later...The
windshield leaked (no prob, more silicone, it's a work truck), till
the front end collapsed (luckily entering a driveway and not at
speed) from internal rust - I'm sure there's Bus owners who can
relate to that! 
My point is, repairs can be made to anything, but they should be 
done right and documented.
