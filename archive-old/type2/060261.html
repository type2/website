&gt; For the record (see archives), I went through 3 sets of new, &quot;top of the

&gt; There was no continuity at all in some of the wires, and others had such
&gt; crummy terminal clips that the breeze from the cooling fan blew them right off
&gt; the plugs.

      Yup,  don't worry so much about the brand (as long as they have the correct
seals and plug ends), just make sure that the &quot;wires&quot; are, well, *wires*, as in
copper, not carbon, or whatever they're using these days. Another thing I've
found is that you have to make sure the connectors are screwed in tight to the
wire (on the plug end) and acutally touching wire on the dizzy end.
       You can buy copper plug wire and make your own too, if you have some good
seals and ends. And you can spray the wires and dizzy cap with silicon or WD-40
to protect against moisture, especially if you live in a rainforest like Portland
or Seattle. Wish I lived there -- my daughter lives in Portland, I really like
it.
