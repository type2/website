Subject: Trip Report - NJ to Ontario!

Hey Now

First let me say, thanks for the good thoughts - Samiam, my '77 Westy,
took his three passengers on an 800+ mile round-trip from Berkeley
Heights, NJ to Oxford Mills, Ontario and performed like a champ!

About 2.5 hours into the trip, we stopped for a bio break, and when
we returned to the bus, it would not start!  Seemed like a wedged
solenoid.  Rather than take the 20 minutes right then to fix it, Robert
pushed, and I pop-started the bus, and left it running (through 2 fuel
stops, yikes) all the way to Ontario and the Kenstock festival.

Saturday morning, a new Kenstock event was unveiled - VW Mechanic's
School.  I had 4 able-bodied folks push the bus backwards while in 3rd
gear (a la Muir) to make sure the starter gear wasn't hung up.  I then
grabbed the big screwdriver and my current tester, and went under the
starter.  Starter goes fine...  Solenoid engages with a little coaxing.
Zap the solenoid a couple times, and then rap it with a hammer a couple
times (a la Muir).  Bus starts great!

Sunday afternoon, we head out on the road, assured that we can turn the
bus off (and back on) at will.  Well.  Re-read the second paragraph, but
reverse the direction of travel...

The bus ate about 41 gallons of premium, 1.5 qts of 30-weight, and ran
like an absolute champ the whole time.  The Dometic fridge (oops, it
doesn't work - make that &quot;cooler&quot;) kept ice for over 48 hours, and the
CD player (no, it's not original equipment) outplayed the wind noise
of 3 open windows at 65 MPH.

Now for the real surprising part.  The only other VW bus I saw the entire
trip was Robert's (V_at_L listmember) '95 EuroVan camper, the Space Shuttle.
The only other aircooled VW we saw was a parked yellow bug in southern
Ontario.  Got lots of waves from other motorists, though - there are VW
sympathizers out there, volks!

And to pick up on the old &quot;Border Crossing&quot; thread, when we crossed into
Canada, we were waved right through, and when we crossed back (me in the
lead, Robert behind), the fellow in the booth asked if I was with that
other Volkswagen bus.  &quot;Some kind of VW convention, huh?&quot;  They always
ask what we do for a living on the way back into the country, and they
always get friendly and don't ask any more questions when we tell them 
that we're computer programmers.  Go figure!

That's all - thanks for reading.  I'm off to find a new solenoid!

        TTFN
