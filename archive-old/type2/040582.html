Tony,
The vehicle needs to have whatever it had for smog equipment when it was 
sold. So if it was a &quot;49-state vehicle&quot; it needs whatever that had on it; if 
it was a Ca vehicle, it needs what that had. So check into the history, look 
at any stickers, talk to the VW dealer parts people to get the history of 
how it was equipped when first sold.
For those who previously brought a &quot;49-state vehicle&quot; into Ca and were 
charged a $300 smog abatement fee, there was good news yesterday. Following 
an earlier court decision that found the fee contrary to law, both houses of 
the legislature passed bills to refund the $300 and maybe add a little 
interest. The differences need to be resolved and then signed by the gov; 
but there is hope we'll get our fee refunded.
But Tony that is history; they stopped collecting the fee after the court 
decision. Before you go for the test, make sure it is well tuned per the 
factory spec (timing, idle speed), and that everything for smog is there and 
works. If idle CO is out of spec, you can adjust the screw under the plastic 
cap on the top of the air flow monitor box.
Turning it counterclockwise leans the mixture and lowers CO. Try 1/4 turn at 
a time. You might first want to have the test done &quot;off line&quot;. for a reduced 
fee (perhaps). That way if you are way out you avoid being declared a 'gross 
polluter' and consigned to the secondary official state-operated inspection 
unit for further flogging! Once you know you are in spec, it should stay in 
spec unless wear and tear sets in.
Good luck!
