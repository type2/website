&gt; I've tried CARFAX and about 4 other services but no one can do the pre 1981
&gt; vehicles. Anyone know a web site that does?
&gt; and trying to buy a 73 Kombi

Call your local State Police.
Tell them it's a &quot;hippie van &quot;  ( for faster service :).
They have very accurate information. And it's Free.
