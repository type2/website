Subject: Re: [T2] Fwd: Bay Window Westy Article in Providence Journal
  and Website

The idea that I'm going to put even $7500 into my 67 westy so I can drive  it 
everyday. I know its has a lot of miles on it at least a few 100k miles and  
yes its a rough bus, but it makes more sense for me to invest  money into a  
bus I get to restore then to pay twice that for something else. It would not  
make my life any more convenient to be making payments on a new car and I don't 
 see any out there that are going to last as long as my bus. I have driven it 
for  3 yrs both as a daily driver and as the perfect work truck( its made it 
down  a  paths a newer ford truck would not and has replaced a Suburban that I 
 can't find the right parts for with out costing me the total  cost I have  
in my westy which is $350  that's buying it and getting it road worthy and  
minus oil and gas and two state inspections (no more..lol) for 3 years of  
driving. THATS ONE CAR PAYMENT no thanks. I don't feel bad about selling the  wife's 
Nissan  to use the bus and bug as daily drivers.
