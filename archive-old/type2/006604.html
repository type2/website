The event was the VW Springmeet at the Fairgrounds in Puyallup WA, and the
Roadcow was a big hit at the WetWesties campout for the weekend.  The paint
scheme is eye-catching in the photos on the website, but in the flesh, so to
speak, it's downright startling :-)  Britt did not display Roadcow in the
show, but I'm certain he could have won a trophy if he had...

Britt reported that he drove straight through on his return home, apparently
without any problems.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  And just to let you all know (if you didn't already), Britt Grannis is
the new owner of Roadcow.  I believe he has just finished taking it to the
Puyllap or however you spell it event.  &lt;&lt;
