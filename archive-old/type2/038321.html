Subject: Replacing window rain guard

Hello all:

I am pursuing replacing the rubber window scrapers on the driver and 
passenger doors of my 72 bus. These are the rubber strips that press up 
against the window, preventing the rain from seeping into the inside of the 
door, where it then can enter the vehicle. Mine no longer press firmly 
against the window ... so when it rains, water comes into the car. And it 
rains a lot in the Seattle area.

Has anybody out there done this procedure? I'm trying to figure out how much 
of everything I have to take apart to put the new rubber in. Looks like the 
windows might have to come out, but I don't know about the other molding 
pieces, the wing window, etc.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
