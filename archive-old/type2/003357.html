I had a similar problem. Turned out to be a loose shock. I THOUGHT it was
tight, but it tightened up another quarter turn and the noise stopped.

&gt;     Can anyone suggest what the cause might be of a loud clunking noise
&gt; coming from I think the rear undercarriage of my 79 bus?  My mechanic
just
&gt; replaced the rubber engine mounts and that did not solve the problem.
&gt; Exhaust system is tight, shocks appear to be OK.  I live on a gravel road
&gt; any bump makes the car sound like it's drumming, very loud, like metal
&gt; hitting metal.  It's not noisy on a very smooth road.  Nothing is
obviously
&gt; loose.  Any ideas on how to diagnose the problem?   thanks,  Mimi Cantwell
