Subject: [T2] weber carbs and brake booster

Hi Everybody,
Right niw I am in the process of getting my 71 westy going(needed
engine) and i was planning on using the dual weber DCNF's that i have. 
Is there any way to hook up the booster to this/these carbs? is it
necessary or can the car be driven without the extra help of the
booster? thanks for any reply
