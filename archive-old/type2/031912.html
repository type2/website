Rachel:

Try Bud's Bugs in Concord, CA.  It's located not far from the old Price 
Club that used to be there, if you're familiar with that.  I think they're 
on Folsom Court.  You can look up their address at budsbugs_dot_com.

&gt; Any of you helpful folks know of any in the Berkeley area? Or the general
