Subject: Upgrading to a 2000 engine.

I am looking to take the 1600 upright with a thrown rod, out of my 72 
transporter, and replace it with a new one.  I was wondering if it is 
possible to replace it with a 2000 engine.  Has anyone done this?  I know 
that I will have to get new exhaust, and carbs, but will it work?

Thanks,
Roy
