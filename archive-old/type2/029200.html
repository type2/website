X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Speaking from experience on my 78s, I found doing the 1/4&quot; closed cell foam
seal under the trailing edge of my luggage rack made a huge difference on
both my campers, even though they both had 100% intact tents &amp; new pop-top
seals. It is a PITA to get in there since you have to remove the luggage
rack which requires removing the headliner paneling etc.

While waiting for the time to tackle that PITA on my second 78 I discovered
that if you roll the loose folded tent canvas after you have dropped the
top (but before you latch it) it will reduce the breeze noticeably, BUT
putting in the weatherstripping made it dissapear. This of major importance
if you hope that the rear passengers (which in my case, cry when they get
cold) will remain semi-comfortable.
