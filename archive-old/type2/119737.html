&gt; I want to eliminate my head gaskets on my 1.7 engine, and make up for the

&gt;
&gt; How much 'shim' must I use?

Take a micrometer.  Measure the thickness of the gasket.  Use that much
spacer.

Better practice would be to &quot;CC&quot; the cylinders and heads to achieve
volumetric balance and the compression ratio you desire. See the following
article in the library for details:
http://www.type2_dot_com/library/engineg/shims.htm

&gt; Better yet, can I just put head gaskets at the base of the barrels?

No.  They are different diameters.

                             OOK!
