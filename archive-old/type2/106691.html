Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Cooler seal

&gt;How much of a problem is it to change the oil cooler seals with the
&gt;engine in? Will I save any time doing it this way as opposed to pulling the
&gt;engine?

Nah - just pull it and renew all the rubber you find (hoses, seals, etc.). 
Also take the time to look for missing pieces and clean EVERYTHING.

For me replacing the seals with the motor in place would be an emergency 
tactic.
