Subject: Re: [T2] Need PN for VW sodium filled valve, HELP?

&gt;By the way, anyone want to buy a set of sodium filled valves?  $175 for the
&gt;set.  I won't break the set.  They cost too much to replace.

I'd also like to sell mine (TRW).  I could only find three just now - the
fourth one had some light pitting on the surface of the valve - I hope I
didn't do something stupid like throw it away.  Anyway I will sell mine
individually since I can only find three.  They are used with very low
mileage.  Make me a reasonable offer.

-David
