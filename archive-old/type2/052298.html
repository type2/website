Subject: Re: [T2] 2/3 front bench seat in a bus

Did that years ago in my 71 Westy- not sure where we got the 2/3 seat
(from an earlier bus, I think), but I remember putting hinges in the
front so the seat could flip forward, and in the back, had to cut a slot
on one side of the pedestal so it could sit level- the otherside slipped
into the provided  3/4 circle that's there for the stock single seat. 
We eventually got tired of climbing over the seat to access the rear,
but it made for cozy riding in front, and the passenger could stretch
out!  MB  78 Westy

&gt; Anyone ever installed a 2/3 1/3 bench seat in a 73 bus replacing the
&gt; front single seats?  Will this work? How much modification would be
&gt; necessary?
&gt; Thanks for any input.
