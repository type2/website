Subject: Looses power at crusing speed-coil? condensor? something else?

Hey folks,

I am having a problem today, where I loose power while crusing at 60 mph or
so, much backfiring.  I stopped and checked, adjusted the points and it
seemed better, then got much worse.  I stopped, yanked the distributor and
carefully set the points, cleaned the cap, rotor, rechecked all vacuum
connectors, spark plug connectors and everything was normal, no backfiring.

Back on the road, all is well, 15 miles later power loss reoccurs, I change
to a slower road (I know everything is okay that I can do anything about)
and continue on maxing out at 40-45 mph.  After stopping at red lights, I am
able to go 55-60, then I slow down again.  So maybe there is a temp related
failure.  I did make it home, in the city it drove nearly normally.

I am thinking I have either a bad coil or condensor.

Condensor is pretty new, the coil is pretty old.  I know that the condensor
gets hot when the engine is running, and maybe the apparent temp related
observations can be accounted for by blaming the coil.

Any ideas?

Much thanks in advance.
