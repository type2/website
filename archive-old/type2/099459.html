Subject: fuel tank sender install was gauge won't go to 1/1 

Hello Eddie.........I just did a fuel tank inspection two weeks ago on my 
76 Westy, while the engine was out. There were 3 screws on each side of the 
vertical firewall panel, and one screw on each side of the lower edge of 
the panel lip. These two screws must be addressed holding the driver 
straight up. They are hard to find and difficult to turn, even with the 
engine out. The other six came out rather easily.  With all the screws out, 
the panel unhooks from a sheetmetal lip, and it needs considerable space to 
fold toward the back of the bus prior to being totally free.On my car, lots 
of body sealer held the panel in place also.

With the panel off, I looked at the placement of the fuel sender, and 
decided I couldn't perform any manipulations on the unit even with the 
panel off.  My hand was too large to get in under the remaining 
overhanging  fixed portion of the panel shielding the top of the tank.  The 
sender is about 6 inches inside and forward in this covered space, and I 
think it would require a special tool to remove the old sender and insert a 
new one.

I had neither the special tool or the patience to try to get the sender out 
some other way, so I buttoned it back up and put the engine back in. 
Incidently, the tank compartment looked like new inside. Like the day it 
rolled off the assembly line.

I'll cut a hole in the fixed panel above the sender if I ever decide to 
replace it.

Getting that rear firewall panel off is very taxing in my opinion, but even 
that doesn't expose the sender very well.   So yes, I'd say it is going to 
be an aggravating job at best.

hello list.
Isn't it quite possible to install the fuel tank sender without dropping
the engine and pulling the tank?
so how much of a PIA (and i imagine it is) to get that sucker out with the
gas tank in place? (im not making any holes!!). i know it can be done, but
sounds like a headche. Will it just be easier to wait until the next
engine pull and do it all at once? I don't mind keeping track of my
milage.... but it would be a super luxury to have a *real* working, fuel
gauge.
i don't mind doing more work with less aggravation. I like working on my
bus. I don't like getting aggrivated. So I will take the maximum work with
minimum aggravation any day of the week.
pulling the tank with the engine in sounds like aggravation....especially
with a FI engine.....which im glad i no longer have &lt;:-O
thanks all
