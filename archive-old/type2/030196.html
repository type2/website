&gt; Good thinking, but: We are not driving at 5000 RPM.

No, but if the flow is flat between 4000 and 5000RPM, it won't pay to put
a smaller pulley on the generator to increase the fan speed at 3500RPM
cruise.  The 5000 figure was to simulate the smaller pulley, not as a
suggestion of normal operation.

My feeling is that the designers did a good job of sizing the system and
there's not much we backyard engineers can do to improve on their work.
