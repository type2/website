In Annapolis I see one or two splitties a year..and one of those is usually from
out of state.  I saw one last week and took a close look to soak up some
nostalgia.  I came away thinking of most of the differences between the splitty
and my 83 vanagon air cooled as IMPROVEMENTS.  Still, I'd like to have the time
to restore one and get it on the road.  Maybe next year.  John Jensen in
