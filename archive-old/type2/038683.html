&gt; Please let me know your ideas.

I've used ordinary black RTV sealer with good results on the doghouse tin
pieces.  Nice thing about this stuff is that if you cut it carefully with
a razor blade the first time you disassemble it, it will go back together
with minimal gaps.

Don't get carried away with the RTV, though.  Small gaps are perfectly OK
and won't leak a significant amount of cooling air.  I don't seal the fan
housing to the cylinder tins, for example.  Just make sure that the pieces
go together correctly.  It's easy to get the cylinder tin flanges on the
wrong side (inside) the fan shroud.
