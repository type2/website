Subject: Re: [T2] How do I mount this thing??? - I'm done.

Ron does answer personal email.  Although there have been slight issues
with customer service before, it has been my experience that Ron will do
what needs to be done to ensure proper end results.  I think a good couple
days for a business to repspond or take action is acceptable.

Peace, Troy

&gt; Needless to say, between exceptionally long times for
&gt; shipping and poor communication, I am very
