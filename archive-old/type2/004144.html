On my '78 Westy, I have a pair of pipes that hang along each side outboard
of the engine.  They look like exhaust pipes and I notice they kinda angle
up toward the heater flap valves.  In fact, the flap valves have remnants of
flexible duct on the opening that points toward the pipes (the flap valves
have two openings, one towards the front to heat the cabin, and the other I
just mentioned).

Are these pipes designed to &quot;bleed&quot; off unused heat from the exchangers and
direct it out the rear of the bus?  I can't find anything in Bentley like
this.

Thanks for any help!
