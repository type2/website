        Dang, that Hoover fellow hits it more often than not.

        Dyer and fellow tree-huggers,
        While your older VW bus, at idle, does produce more polution than
a modern fuel-injection + catalyst + lamda system vehicle, your old
bus is still pretty respectable running at normal rpms on the road. Properly
maintained, your normal-driving emissions (high rpm in the California test)
are about the same as pass-fail limits for a new car. Of course, a new
car, properly maintained, runs at less than half those same limits, but
you're still in the ball-park with that '66. Keep it in good shape and
drive proudly. 

        Know your smog numbers, and the limits, and you'll be surprised 
how good your older vehicle can be. The one thing you can't really
control is idle CO, so don't idle for extended periods. Otherwise, be happy.

        Happy Motoring!
        Bill

        ps -Agree with The Chameleon- smog pumps DO support continued combustion
of CO to CO2 and HCs to CO2 and H2O. 3 way catalysts did a better job but
a smog pump is not a bad start.
