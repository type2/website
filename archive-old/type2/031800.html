&gt; I been painting and welding semi's for 25 years, and believe me, I've

well I'm an engineer so I guess my welding and refinishing is no where
near your quality or speed but then I'm not doing it for someone else.

but I understand, I paid my way through college as a tour guide in DC,
needless to say whenever friends come to town the first thing out of their
mouths is &quot;show me DC&quot;  I generally give em the Grey Line schedule.

I go away I generally want to see a tourist like a hole in the head, went
to Nicaragua on my honeymoon.

&gt; My Vanagon is perfect for this endeavor---

don't got no Vanagon, in fact my 78 is my daily driver, only other vehicle
avaliable to me is my wife's Sant*rn and she usually needs it for work

I live in the big city and don't have any place to park more than one
I'm lucky in that I have a garage and a parking pad, but that's it. wife
usually has to park on the street (her's has lojack)
