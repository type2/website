Was writ by &quot;George Lyle&quot; I gave him a little nudge to get him going each
time traffic crawled ahead....

Sounds like a strange &quot;mating&quot; ritual for a &quot;Winter Bus&quot; :^)

Bus content. I just changed the points (I know get an electronic Ignition)
but this time I just pulled the whole distributor out and did it out of the
bus. I did this since I have a Double Cab with a 74 bus engine hatch welded
in the bed and it was soooo easy to take the distributor out, and I didn't
have to worry about dropping that darn screw that secures the points. Total
time - under 5 minutes. Tools required 13mm socket, screwdriver, feeler
gauge. I know that the purists will cringe at this modification but I use my
bus and this is a great feature to be able to access the engine from the top
as well as from the original engine cover.
Have a great Friday,
