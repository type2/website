Subject: Re: [T2] PLF VW /Paypal

Kevin,

I've observed this kind of post for literally years now. What I've seen 
is that those who order from PLF and complain seem to think that Dawn 
goes to the shelf, grabs the proper finished canvas and sticks it in a 
box.  That doesn't seem to be how she works.  Apparently, she gets the 
order, purchases the appropriate materials and begins construction. My 
wife has seamstressed in the past, and the second item is the kicker... 
  If the appropriate materials are not immediately available, things 
take a bit longer.

As for the phone being disconnected; miss a payment and see what 
happens. Phone being disconnected does not prove malice. It could 
simply reflect what others have said... She's out of town visiting 
family.

Lastly, in my years of observation, I can't recall anyone who was 
&quot;ripped off&quot;.  In some cases it took a VERY long time for the order to 
be delivered, but as I said, I can't recall anyone who did not 
eventually get their order.  You might want to search the archives...

Jim

&gt; a bad deal for anyone who is considering buying from them YMMV but my
&gt; experience has been a bad one. 345.00 down the drain. Sorry for the
&gt; rant. But I'm pretty disappointed, since my only recourse is to
&gt; &quot;contact the seller&quot; and dawn won't answer my e-mails and her # is
&gt; disconnected.
