Subject: Spacer ring?

I just took apart my rear wheel shaft/housings/stubb axl all that stuff and as 
I am looking at the Bentley and the Haynes manuals I find a puzzeling 
discrepency. If you look at page 118 fig 7.1 and 7.2 in the Haynes manual and 
page 60 of the tranny and rear axl section fig 10.9 and 10.10 of the Bentley 
you'll see that in the earlier model has a shorter spacer ring on what looks 
like the outside of the oil seal, #11 fig 7.1 Haynes and #4 fig 10.9 Bentley. 
My bus is a 76 and had this spacer ring. Has anybody run into this before? It's 
quite peculiar that both these highly reputable manuals are both wrong.
