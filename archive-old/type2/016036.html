Don't forget to keep an eye on the brake fluid reservoir level.  Add
to replace what you bleed before it runs dry.

&gt;&gt;...Every time, no matter what we've tried.
&gt;&gt; A big bubble or two comes out every time we 
&gt;open-pump-close-release.
&gt;
&gt;I'm no expert, but what I've always done is:
&gt;
&gt;1.  pump the brake pedal a couple of times, then hold it down with 
&gt;light-moderate pressure
&gt;2. open the bleeder on the wheel cylinder and allow the fluid to 
&gt;flow.
&gt;3. Close the bleeder valve
&gt;4. Release the brake pedal
&gt;5. Go back to step 1.
&gt;
&gt;Obviously you need two people to do this.  If your wife is the 
&gt;brake-pumper be very nice to her!
&gt;
&gt;If you release the brake pedal while the bleed valve is open (as in 
&gt;pumping the brakes), you will probably pull air into the system.  
&gt;Not 
&gt;much, but enough to annoy you with small bubbles.
