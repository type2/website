Subject: Re: [T2] What is it with the 009?

&gt;
&gt;Why is everyone thinking that an 009 is better?  

Some always equate cheaper with better. A new one costs less than 1/3rd the
cost of the right one. Most of us grow out of it as soon as we become
financially responsable for ourselves and learn of neccessity how not to
waste time/money by following instructions given first. 

I don't get it,
&gt;ESPECIALLY if you already have a vacuum advance distributor.  Let's say
&gt;in the worst case scenario where the vacuum advance isn't working, it's
&gt;just like an 009 anyways (except for maybe a different centrifugal
&gt;advance curve) so you might as well just leave the thing in there.

But that's only if you apply LOGIC. A tool not in everyones bag of tricks,
particularly when cheaper is better. But I suspect it's just someone paying
his dues and learning. Don't know what's wrong. Don't know what to do. Will
do what I can with resources at hand and see what happens. Learning by
trial and error is a valid method. Most of what we know about what not to
do we learned by doing it, even though we were told not to. 
&gt;
&gt;This email is also sparked from the fact that when I just bought my 78
&gt;bus, it was running like crap. There was no accelleration and it had no
&gt;power.  When we went and looked in the engine compartment, what do you
&gt;know... there was an 009 stuck on the engine BY THE REBUILDER!

Did you not have opportunity to inspect the vehicle before you purchased
it??? You are no less guilty than the PO or rebuilder for buying non-stock.
Join the club. 

 &gt;
&gt;Luckly, the PO had the correct dizzy sitting around and it ran SOOOO
&gt;much better and actually had power.  

Lucky indeed, value reclaimed and put back to use. Good followup.

Is there something I don't know
&gt;about the 009 or are people just not willing to clean and lube the
&gt;breaker plates cuz I'm really curious why people keep trying it..

We are in the age of no maintenance, use it up and throw it away economics.
The old designs that could be maintained indefinately are becoming a
passing fashion.
