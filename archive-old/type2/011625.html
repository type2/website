&gt;I have always bought DIFFERENT cams for hydraulic and solid engines, even
&gt;stock applications. If you are using the same cam and it's working, then
&gt;perhaps it works! I just know what parts are available, and the theory
&gt;behind why, and have stuck with it. I know a lot of information that is NOT
&gt;in the books/manuals, but this isn't one of em'!

The cams had minor lift differences but roughly the same duration, thing
is eventually (by late 80's) VWoC rebuilds were coming with EITHER cam
in hydraulic lifter cars pretty randomly apparently.  I have personally taken
apart 2 known VWoC rebuilds, one had one, one had the other.  A solid cam
might run a tad better for the increased life but it is only about 0.040&quot;
or so.  All
the higher mile origional German 2.0's I've taken apart have had what they
should have had if origional.  I don't think BTW that the one ring, 2 ring, no
ring stuff alluded to by Wilson really washes again from personal experience,
and certainly only applies to OEM forged steel cams which are getting rare
now days anyway.

I'd note of course you must use solid spacers the appropriate pushrods, etc
as you would expect to convert to hydraulics, but I wouldn't fret the cam too
much, they wear badly regardless if it isn't the &quot;optimal&quot; ramp angle maybe it
wears a bit worse, I don't think you'll get any other problems.  Another
worry,
I've personally seen differences in 2.0 rocker arms (all with the 10mm
adjusters)
that prevented some from being used with hydraulics, no real rhyme to that
though, just make sure nothing in the valvetrain rubs and that the screws are
out an appropriate distance and the arm doesn't endanger releasing the
keepers.

We've done this before, check them archives.
