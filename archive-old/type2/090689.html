Subject: Thermometer, oil temp

Hi all,
I know there was something on the website about
running a digital kitchen thermometer sensor into the
dipstick tube and then running the wires up front to
the cockpit. just wondering if anyone has given that
or something similar a try and any advice you might
have. Thanks, peace,
Giles
