Subject: RE: [T2] &quot;Essential&quot; on-board tool kit and parts...

Check the Type2 Archives, Scott.  I can recall at least two healthy 
discussions on this topic within the last few years.

Hello all. Recently  purchased a 69 Westy and have been lurking here  for a 
few months. Any thoughts on what tools and parts to carry along  as standard 
equipment?  I am new to VW but mechanically competent.

Also need a  coiled spring for the drivers seat, anyone have one for  sale 
or know a parts supply in southern California?

Thanks, Scott
