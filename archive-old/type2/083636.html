Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Acceptable speeds

I get 22-24 w/ stock solexes in the flat areas
(North Carolina, Ohio, etc.)  Very light throttle
and I stay at 55.  Very surprised the first few
times I checked it.

&gt; 55-60 mph (to  keep temp down

&gt; better).  Amazing how the milage
&gt; &gt; went from ~18 to 22-24.  (and it blows half
&gt; as much oil!)

&gt; OK  I want to know how you get 22-24 out of a
&gt; big old Westy when driving
&gt; my 78 deluxe pretty much the same way I have
&gt; never managed to get more
&gt; than 20 on a good day with a tailwind
&gt; 
&gt; and of course around the city where I live I
&gt; consider it a good day when I
&gt; get 16 in stop and go traffic
