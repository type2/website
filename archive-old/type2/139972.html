Subject: Re: [T2] The full report (long)

&lt;&lt; I chose to loosen up all the case bolts and see whether I could tap the 
pickup into place. That worked, but whether I did any damage to the 
Loctite seal, I won't know for a few weeks, when I test run the engine. 
I don't think the halves moved. &gt;&gt;

Just for the record, the Maseratti 3500 straight six racing engine
(alloy block and head) came from the factory with a silk thread
bedded in sealant for a head gasket... ;-)
