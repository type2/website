&gt; has anyone documented a conversion to electric w/s washer pump in a

&gt; i know people have done it, using a microswitch in the stalk, electric
pump and modified reservoir, but i was looking for a website with
pictures.

Another thing you can do,, instead of a micro switch on the stalk, you can
supply power to a small relay coil,, take the other side of the coil to a
home made contact on the stalk,, a small gob of epoxy holding a tiny wire
soldered to a thumb tack kinda idea..... when you pull on the stalk, it
grounds to the column,, and energizes the squirter pump..

go a step further with a relay from a car that gives you a pulsed 3 squirt
sequence ,, and turns on the wipers ,,, then parks them after 3 cycles of
wiping......
