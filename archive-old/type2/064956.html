Subject: horn wiring--still stumped

&gt;And for still another experience (of intermittentant horn honking): keys
&gt;swinging beneath the ignition key wore through the paint on the steering
&gt;column, eventually grounding the column back through the ignition switch.

Peter:

This looks like what was probably happening to my bus when the evil and
spitefull PO ripped out the horn wiring, and replaced it with a push-button
switch mounted on the steering column tube.  

I still haven't discovered how the horn wire passes through / around the
coupling disk.  I'm pretty sure it attaches to one of the bolts on the disk
and then another wire attaches to the lower end of the same bolt??  If so,
how does this lower wire keep from wrapping around the shaft of the steering
box when the steering wheel is turned all the way in one direction or the other?

It's no problem getting to where the problem is--'cuz I've removed
the ENTIRE steering system from the bus (from steering box to
steering wheel, and everything in between!).  In fact, the ENTIRE 
bus is still gutted--running short on time.

I got the Westy canvas almost done--just have to screw in the two
side channels.  It's not all THAT hard--kinda' time consuming though.
I just got new tabs (hasn't been tabbed since I bought it in '91) they
were only $35 !??  I thought this strange as my '74 bug is up over $50,
and so is my '70 pickup truck. : }  [this is in WA state]

 .....be on the road in no time.
