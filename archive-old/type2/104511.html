Subject: Re: [T2] inside slider handle 

Enough talk.

Now, take action!!

The hinged metal Vanagon inside handles will fit nicely on the late bay 
sliding doors.

And because they are METAL, they have less of a tendency to break when you 
are pulling the rear handle to close the sliding door.

(While you are out camping . . . you use the rear handle because you are 
considerate of people OUTSIDE the bus/camper when you are returning to the 
bus/camper late at night after a visit to 'Maggie'; you are returning to the 
bus/camper late at night after a visit to 'Maggie' because you are 
considerate of others INSIDE the bus/camper)


So, save the hinged metal inside slider handles from the Vanagons for future 
recycling onto the late bays.

If you have any doubts, check the prices for Vanagon handles at 
WestCoastMetrics - $28 for black, $42 for brown
