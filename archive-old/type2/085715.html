Subject: RE: [T2] '78 Bus FI troubleshooting - only runs on cold-start after engine swap

Is the tack wire for sure hooked up to the condenser side of the coil ?. No 
tack no injection.

&gt;
&gt;I just went through this myself (put a 78 engine in my 79.)  There
&gt;should be a wire from the + side of the coil (terminal 15) going to 
&gt;terminal
&gt;86c on the relay.  This wire provides power to the relay, and if
&gt;I remember correctly, controls the switching of power to 88b.  There should 
&gt;also
&gt;be a wire from the coil (terminal 15 again) to the fan relay, which
&gt;in turn gets juice from the ignition switch (I'm a little foggy on this
&gt;part as my PO had removed the fan ran the ign wire straight to the coil.)
&gt;
&gt;So, to summarize, turn on the key, test power to terminal 15 of the
&gt;coil (+ side) and if that is good, check power to terminal 86c on the
&gt;double relay.  I'm willing to bet this is where the problem is.

&gt; &gt; I tried following the Bentley book in testing the double
&gt; &gt; relay. The relay seems to have positive in the right place
&gt; &gt; when the key is off. With the key on, it does not seem to
&gt; &gt; energize 88b as it is supposed to. Also, we are supposed to
&gt; &gt; check for presence of ground on 85, but what seems to be
&gt; &gt; labeled 85 doesn't seem to have a pin long enough to check
&gt; &gt; (or I am checking it and it isn't showing ground). This was
&gt; &gt; all working with the old engine, so I don't think the relay
&gt; &gt; is bad. Also we tried another relay that Lou says is &quot;known
&gt; &gt; good&quot; and it didn't work either.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm thinking that maybe wherever the signal goes into the
&gt; &gt; relay to switch-on 88b is where the fault is, but I don't
&gt; &gt; understand from the wiring diagram where I should be
&gt; &gt; checking. The switched positive from the keyswitch up front
&gt; &gt; must run back somewhere, through someting and eventually to
&gt; &gt; an unknown pin on the double relay. I think I should be
&gt; &gt; working backwards from the where this signal comes into the
&gt; &gt; relay, but I don't see where to check.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Any guesses what we didn't hook up right? Any suggestions on
&gt; &gt; any of this in general?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks much!
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; I promise a full report on the engine swap/AVP situation when
&gt; &gt; all is done.
