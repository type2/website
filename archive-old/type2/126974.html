Subject: Re: [T2] Installing new rings - hints

The reason they say to remove the ridge at the top of
the cylinder is when the piston is installed and the
engine running it could break the top ring when the
piston travels to the top on the compression and
exhaust stroke. To prevent this from happening you
remove the ridge.. Phil
