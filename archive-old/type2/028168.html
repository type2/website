I just saw a small notice and picture of a nice looking stainless steel 
muffler set in the Aug. 2000 issue of Hot VW's Magazine. It's in the Parts 
Bin section on page 124.  Available from OE Vee Dub in Colorado.  No price 
is listed.  It's designed for a '63-'71 bus with type 1 upright motor or 
12-1600 beetles.  They are made in England. Has anyone tried one of these?  
Maybe UK listees?  I'm looking at a new muffler in the near future for my 
'70 Westy.  Have to check the price today.  Thanks for any reports or 
comments.
