Subject: Re: [T2] Hard start

&gt; When The weather gets hot, the bus is hard to start. When I turn the key all
&gt; the way to start the bus. It just keeps trying to start, but it won`t until
&gt; after about five attempts.
&gt; This only happens when the temperature outside is hot or if the bus has been
&gt; running and the bus is hot. In the morning when the temp and bus are cool, the
&gt; bus starts immediately. Any answer will be appreciated

now this one is a textbook case for the hot start relay job.

of course you should check and clean up the connections and lube the
starter bushing and replace it if its worn (starter shaft wiggles round).
just because its good mechanicing.

cheers
