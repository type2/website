Subject: re:  NEW Microbus

I've read about this, and it may become reality.  However, I wouldn't
expect a reincarnation of the the Type 2.  The rumor I heard was back to
rear engine, rear drive.  The engine will likely not be air-cooled because
of emissions issues.  I also would not expect the front seats to be mounted
above the wheels because of safety issues.

I would, however, expect to see a new version of the splitty nose.  THAT, I
think, would help to sell a bunch.
