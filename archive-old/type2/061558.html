&gt;So I wired this huge Christmas wreath to the front of the splitty. So big
&gt;it comes almost to the headlights. We made it from lots of garish bits we
&gt;bought at Pottery Barn which is a store where they sell practically
&gt;everything except pottery especially if it is tacky.

Awright!!  I knew you were one of us, Ken (us?  Wierdos who decorate our
busses for the holidays!).

&gt;Doesn't David Schwarze cover his bus with green &amp; red LEDs every year? I
&gt;wish I knew how to do that. Any pictures out there?

Yes sir!  I just put up a picture of my bus on the web:

I have over 500 lights on it this year and I still haven't been shot at or
arrested.  They are just standard Christmas tree lights - it's real easy to
do.  People tell me my bus looks like it escaped from the Disneyland
electrical parade - not sure that's a compliment but at least they're
smiling, and that's the whole point I guess.
