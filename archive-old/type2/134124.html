Subject: 1980 vanagon questions

It's new to me so I've a few AC vanagon questions

1st heating.
am i correct in that all the HEAT air comes from that plastic fan and duct
contraption on the alternator?

I know the heaters require some constant airflow, but isn't there a better
way?
or should I just install my small (18Kbtu) propane RV furnace and go w/that?

can I add the front heaterassembly from a watercooled van to get a fan forced
defroster? will it fit in the same place looks like it would.


2nd  EGR,   mine was bypassed and removed, anyone have spare vanagon AC EGR
pipes and stuffs? I'd like to get it functioning again to help keep combustion
temps down and knock down.

3rd  DIzzy,  mine has a 009  I'd like to go back to the vac adv/ret that was
original in my non-CA engine anyone have a good priced good spare?
should I just go to a 050 which is better set for a 2.0L FI motor  and I plan
on installing a pertronix w/rev limiting rotor

4th I plan on replacing the high pressure fuel lines, how do I replace the
short part from the injector to the metal line?
I was thinking of adding a mechanical fuel pressure gauge to give a heads up
on system pressures.

the decelleration valve was bypassed, I plan on making sure thats hooked up
properly.



soo spare AC van parts i'm looking for (cheap of course)

non-CA dizzy
EGR pipes,linkages, and filter

thanks for your time and thoughts.
