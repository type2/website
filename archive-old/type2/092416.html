Subject: Ammeter Question...

Hi,

I just got my VDO ammeter today (with no installation instructions) and I'm 
trying to figure out
how to install it.
1) Does the VDO ammeter actually measures the current directly without 
using a shunt? (scary!)
2) I have a '69 bus with a generator and looking at the wiring diagram 
(believe it or not it matches
  the wiring in the bus) I see the following problems with the installation 
instructions I found on the web
a) If I split the cable between the B+ terminal of the regulator and the 
battery, then I will only see if the
generator is providing current
b) if split the cable after the starter, then I will only see the current 
used by the loads...

Well, I think I found the solution while writing this message. I have to 
reroute the cable from the regulator to
join the circuit at the ammeter instead of the battery as it is right now. 
And if I split the cable just before
the headlight switch, then I only need to bring 1 conductor to the front 
carrying only the current from the
generator. I put my proposed setup on a webpage for you to see.

The list is a big help, even before posting the questions!
