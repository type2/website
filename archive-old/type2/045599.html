Subject: [T2] RE: Gauges for 16 yr old's mega tour

Being 17...I thought I'd comment on this since I'm probably one of the
youngest busers out there....

If the person in question has just turned 16 or just got their license, I
think it would be a VERY bad idea to let them go out on a &quot;mega tour&quot;
(meaning driving cross country?)  especially in a bus....unless they really
know the bus inside and out.  I got my first car (71 bus - Stella) when I was
15 and worked on it a couple months before I got my license to get it running
and driving...and I knew that if I didn't, I wouldn't have a vehicle to
drive.  I did a lot of work on that old girl before she was ready to hit the
road....I got to know that bus very well.  I got the bus last year in the
beginning of june, and I got my license on July 30th last year....4 days
after my birthday.  I didn't take the bus out of town for a good 2 weeks,
just in case something were to happen.  I got on &quot;the list&quot; about a month or
two before I even got my bus, and read the manuals over and over.....and
asked a LOT of questions  (I'm sure many of you remember that).  Then, Buses
Nowhere Near the Arch came up, and I wanted to go....but my mother frowned
upon it...so I just went up into northern WI for a 4 day camping
excursion.....I was ticked at the time, but now I'm glad she did what she
did, because I don't think I was ready for the actual trip....the bus may
have been, but I don't think that I was.  I started attending DBG campouts,
and got to know a lot of other local busers....this helped a LOT.  I'd drive
up to 2-3 hours to go to a campout...and sometimes had VW events every week
or weekend.  I drove Stella as my daily driver up to about the beginning of
this summer and gave her a break (thats when I got my 62 bus)
Up until last spring, Stella had never been out of state....so on a spur of
the moment decision.... about 30 minutes before we left...I decided to drive
Stella to Detroit for the show last spring.  I'm glad I did this...and I
really didn't have any problems.  I had a wonderful trip too...not that far
away from home (oshkosh, wi) but far enough for my first trip.    Then came
buses nowhere near the arch this year, and I went... I had to.  I drove the
62 down and had no problems with the bus at all (except the fuel line coming
off at 5:30 in the morning on an Illinois interstate) and it was a BLAST.
Now if I wouldn't have been working on my own buses, I probably would not
know what to do, and would have had to call a tow truck or something of the
like.... so make sure that the teenager in question knows the bus inside and
out...becuase problems will arise....and mechanics and tow trucks get very
expensive, very fast.  The only time a real mechanic has ever touched any of
my buses....was to put a helicoil in the head..._dot_cause i didn't want to screw
it up.

Has the teenager in question ever travelled before?  The world is a big
place....and can be scary too....  My grandfather is a truck driver, and I've
been riding with him since I was 7 or so...all over the country....so that
helped me a LOT I'm sure...  It can be a mental thing too....if the teen in
question is ready for the trip....  not insanity or anything like that...but
a mental state....if he's actually ready to go through with it.

I loved to travel...and always have... but I'm glad I didn't take off cross
country the day I got my license... it DOES take practice to really know what
you're doing..  Thankfully, I haven't hit anyone/anything yet (knock
on...uhh... the metal dash... yeah..thats the ticket) and things have just
hit me... so my insurance hasn't gone through the roof...  make sure the
teenager in question knows what he/she is doing while driving...  Teen
insurance rates are outrageous...and theres a reason for it... and I'm paying
for it right now....just because of my age...even though I have a clean
record.

Just my little insight...thought some of you might want to hear it from a
younger buser...  I mean...how many 17 year olds do you know that drive a bus
and are proud of it??  ;-)

all air cooled, all the time

ps....maybe I'm bragging a little... but I've to take advantage of being the
&quot;young one&quot; you know?  ;-)
