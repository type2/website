Sounds like I should say Bigtop Rusty ;-)

VanBondo has been keeping a slow troll for a Westy or Puch type trailer...
I got wind of a teardrop style trailer for next to nada. A couple of calls
on Friday set the planets up for a trailer inspection to start at
Oh-early-thirty on Saturday morning. 
The trailer hunt commenced at 05:30 hrs. Sat, Oct 26, '96. Driving from the
Rotting Rusty Ranch to a place about an hour away, I eventually pulled into
the yard to view a total P.O.S. &lt;07:15&gt; *Not what I intended* Knocked on the
(wrong) trailer and was redirected to the adjacent house. This was an area
where you ask permission from Mr. Smith and Ms. Wesson before trolling the
property. The young man (79 years young and swore like that foul mouthed
librarian on Letterman) =) was slightly hard of hearing when I talked to him
over the phone. No answer was ever given from the property excepting a
&lt;thankfully&gt; overly friendly pit bull and rotty combo *puppy*... I don't
think I will go back in a year! &lt;DOH!&gt; About this time, anyone who has ever
lived in snow country would have sensed a serious hint of impending snow
weather. This is a big change from the hundred degree plus weather that
Phoenix was experiencing two and one half weeks ago.
Being a believer in several things, my sixth sense being one of them, I felt
that there was a reason that I had dragged a** there. I drove all around
checking out the sights and sniffing the air for that barndoor/split oval
smell. Coffee, Westy and me senselessly trolling dirt roads watching the
Quail run. No demands, No innane questions or deadlines from anyone. Ahhh! yes! 
Eventually I drove to a location in the opposite direction. I rounded a bend
and *BOOM* found a trailer of the type that I initially thought that I was
going to view. Yup, it's for sale. Now I need to make further
negotiations... No sale yet on a complete, and original 1948 Toure Teardrop
all aluminum Camping trailer with accompanying tent, jack, three burner
propane stove et al. Done. Complete. No trailer resto from hell. Badda-bing!
Big deal for the fanatic followers of this type of thing. Nearby, on teh
wall, was a picture of Paul Rubens. &quot;Yeah he's a friend of ours.&quot; VAnBondo
thought &quot;Naw, you're....&quot; and stopped.
The next sentence was too obvious for even VanBondo to verbalize or type. I
keep tellin' ya that I go up the the edge and pull back a tad. It makes the
mind wander donut?

Now to go give away the perfectly running, mechanically sweet, complete, non
damaged, '81 Vanagon, with all of the seats that I can't pay anyone to
take... =(
