Subject: Re: [T2] 1968 Bus Passengerside Windshield Wiper Arm

The 68 only arm has the end of a 67 and back where it mounts on the wiper
shafts. This means it has a clamping bolt to hold it to the smooth shaft. 69
and up started the splined shaft with a nut holding the arm on.
The other end, where the blade goes, is the same as 69 and up. A 45 degree
bend with a looped end.


&gt; I have few set of arms. How does one tell if it's a 1968 arm?
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Does anybody out there have a spare 68 type
&gt; &gt;wiper arm or know where one may be obtained?
