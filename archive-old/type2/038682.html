&gt; &gt; Problem with 77 Westy with EFI...
&gt; &gt; After driving down the highway for about the 20 minutes my engine starts
&gt; &gt; sputtering eventually cuts out.
&gt; 
&gt; Fuel Filter.

--&gt; If it's not the fuel filter, make sure the cylinder head temp sensor
is tight in the head (but not *too* tight -- it strips easily!) and has
the proper resistance.  If it fails open or gets disconnected the engine
will load up on fuel and quit once it warms up, due to running rich.  If
it's loose, the engine will run rich erratically and misfire.
