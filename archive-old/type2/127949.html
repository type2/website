Subject: Re: [T2] solex H30/31 pict adjustments

The instructions below look good except I've found
that it works better if I turn the fast idle screw in
until it just barely pushes on the cam with the choke
off. This keeps the throttle butterfly from jamming
closed in the throttle bore.

Steve Elms

&gt;On the 30/31, first set a clearence on the fast idle
&gt;screw, it must not touch the shaft when the choke is
&gt;off. Start the car then set 900 RPM with the air
&gt;volume screw, then go to the mixture screw and (from
3
&gt;turns out)turn in till a 50 RPM drop, then back up
1/2
&gt;turn, adjust the RPM with the volume screw to 950RPM
&gt;and you are done.
