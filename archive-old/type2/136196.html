Subject: SOLUTION: Oil Pump leaking like an Exxon tanker

Sometimes the answer is way too easy. Thanks to everyone who passed
along the general advice that some sort of sealant is needed in this
area. I was prepared to do the job, got the apron pully and tin off.
Took the cover off and got the surfaces clean. Then spent 30 minutes
looking for that gasket that I KNOW I had a few days ago. Finally
found it and went back to the task at hand.

I put a small amount of Suzuki sealant on the gasket to give it a bit
more seal (as everyone suggested) and started to put it back on. The
lower right bolt didn't seem to want to screw in well. I moved to the
other 3 and put them in just short of snug. As I went back to the bolt
that was giving me hassles I tried to tighten it a bit more and it
seemed to be bottoming out? WHAT? This seems quite strange I don't
remember that happening before. I used a small screwdriver to measure
the depth of the hole and low and behold, the damn bolt is longer than
the hole it should fit in. A quick trip w/ a cut off wheel and
suddenly the bolt fits fantastic. I'm thinking now that that corner of
the pump just wasn't snuged down and I would not have had any leaks
had I noticed this before. The first attempt I did torque them down,
but I guess I didn't check that it was a snug fit. Oh well live and
learn. But no leaks. Thanks again everyone.
