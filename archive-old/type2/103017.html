There is a company that sells a kit for that 5 wire 02 sensor.  They
also have a complete range of engine monitoring systems.  All digital
and it even can hook up to a laptop or your home computer.  You can go
as basic or as advanced as you want with their products.  I sound like a
salesman for them......
