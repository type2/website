Well, thank you to everyone that gave me advice on my 74 automatic. I rebuilt
the carbs and now it runs. Very well as a matter of fact. The only problem is
that when you put it in gear it clunks and lunges. Im hoping that my
transmission is not going. I checked the fluid and it looks a healthy color
and is up to the full idicator. The problem is not the idle because at first I
thought it was but now its adjusted way down and it still does the same thing.
Please tell me there is some sort of adjustment to cure this problem that will
not be to costly. Thanks again, Corey Harris
