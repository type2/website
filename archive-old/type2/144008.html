Subject: [T2] Spam

I don't know about you other T2 list members, but in
addition to the &quot;Paypal&quot; spam, most of my incoming T2
messages are now identified as spam, and automatically
arrive into my spam folder.  Speaking as a computer
geek, not a good sign.  Since I use Yahoo! for my
E-mail, that Yahoo! is losing control.  Yahoo! owns
Paypal.  The spam I just looked at was &quot;from paypal.&quot; 
And Yahoo! owns this T2 database.  Looks like Yahoo!
might be losing the battle against spam.  Hopefully
this T2 list doesn't degenerate in quality any
further.
