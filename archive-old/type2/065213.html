Michael...

Here's what I know, fwiw.  My tank did have clamps on the upper hose.  I dont
think the tank had ever been removed, so I think that was stock.  A po had
butchered a hole (looks like he used a canopener) above the sending unit to
replace that.  (I cant say I wouldn't have done a hole myself, but I would
have done it a little cleaner.)  From the design of the tank, I think the gas
could easily slosh up and over the upper connector, even when the tank is
relatively low.  Most tanks Ive seen have some sort of inner baffles to slow
down the sloshing action of the gas, but these have none.  It would concern
me, and I would clamp it.  By the looks of most of the hoses throughout the
system, though, I would do a complete replacement.  Many had cracks, and I
actually got really lucky in finding a leaky one up in the left air duct
(which I thought was only for vapor) but apparently when you fill the tank,
gas will enter these before it will run out the filler hole.  I didn't even
know they were there (You can see the top part if you look in the air duct
from outside, or crane your neck up from inside

The hose I have is rubber reinforced with cloth.  I bought a foot, and you
only need 4&quot; (or so they say), but I would send you 6&quot; (half) just so you
could be sure.  

I'm in Portsmouth, NH, so it wouldn't take long to ship. 
Thanks for the reply.  Hope this helps.

Ned
