Reposting this for a member who is having trouble posting to list:

i am redoing my 1971 and i need to buy original front curtains. just about
every camper has one that noone ever used hence they are in good shape and 
can be remade into regular curtains for the other window. the original
fabric isn'st available. the curtains that i want are plaid, yellow, brown
and white.

Please p-mail any helpful replies to:
