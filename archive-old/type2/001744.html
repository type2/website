To unknown bus owner (I don't have the original message),
&gt; &gt;I recently purchased a 67 bus with a &quot;new&quot; 1600 DP engine. Although it
&gt; &gt;seemed to run pretty well when warm, it was barely driveable when cold
due
&gt; &gt;to a horrendous hesitation (or stumble) at low RPM in each gear.  I was
&gt; &gt;told that the carb (a PICT-34 I think) was new.  It also has a new 009
&gt; &gt;distributor.


All the talk about your distributor is nice to know, but doesn't really
address your problem.  You're describing a situation that happens when the
engine and fuel systems are cold.  They are talking about something that
occurs all the time, regardless of engine temp.
First thing to do is check out your choke settings, to see if the butterfly
valve is opening up or not as the engine heats up... If it remains closed,
you're going to be starving the engine of air, and it will stumble when
cold...
The second thing to do is let the car warm up and have a look at the throat
of the intake manifold.. Watch to see if it ices up or not.  If so, that
could be a big part of your problem, as the gas isn't vaporizing before it
gets into the cylinders, which in turn causes it to combust very poorly in
the cylinders until it gets warm...
The other thing is to warm the bus up before you drive it.. Let it idle for
a couple minutes before you go driving off at high rpms.. This problem
really sounds like a carburation and fuel delivery problem more than the
common &quot;flat spot&quot; issue these guys were talking about...
Always check the easy cheap fixes first.
Good luck, let me know how it turns out..
Tom
