AS a new owner of a Golf TDI which requires synthetic oil, I hope it's not
disappearing. My oil changes are done by VW still so I haven't looked
around yet. Many of the folks on the TDI list are buying 5 gallon buckets
of synthetic oil at farm supply and truck parts places, usually paying $80
- $100.
Of course oil brand is a hot topic over there as well as well as secondary
bypass oil filters to make people more comfortable with the 10,000 mile oil
change interval. It seems like that could be a good addition to a Type4
engine, in addition t the stock full flow filter.
