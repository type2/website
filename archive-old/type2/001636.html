Subject: Festering fingers! (also know as Sufferin' Suckertash!

Couldn't keep away, just had to see the perp who's Phalanges got eaten by Mr
whipy (might change his name to &quot;vamp&quot;!). Pretended I was an investigator
from social services! He told me how hard done by he was, I asked him what
the doctors had said about his fingers, he said they weren't healing due to
rust, under shield (tar like rust proofer) &amp; luminous paint (I put a big
glow in the dark &quot;smiley&quot; on the belly pan 2 months ago). Now remember, I'm
supposed to be from social services, but I'm trying not to laugh!

Got out all the Disabled benefit info, my wife was sent &amp; started to explain
that 4 fingers would have to be amputated &amp; that they had asked me to tell
him! And that he should, consider where he was going to live after he got
out of the mental hospital. &quot;What Hospital&quot; he asked.

Well I explained, we feel that as a compulsive thief, these injuries are
self inflicted. Therefore we need to transfer you to a secure unit for
psychological examination!

I left him I tears! &amp; as pale as his sheets! Yes I am a terrible person, YES
I WILL go to hell. But I bet not one of you has stopped laughing yet!

Well worth the risk of being caught &amp; VERY VERY satisfing.
