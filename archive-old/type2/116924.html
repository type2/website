Subject: Interior roofing

&gt;I am intending on using the panels that you get from &gt;home hardware for the ceilings in office buildings. &gt;ie those rectangle's with a white pattern on one &gt;side that sit in the 'false' ceilings.
&gt;I'm just going to hot glue them to the roof.

Sweet lord in heaven, I picked a bad week to give up snorting drano.

You're saying, I believe, that you're gonna &quot;hot glue&quot; some 2x4 drop tiles to the ceiling of your bus?

For god sakes man, why? I'm sure together we can brainstorm some alternatives with more attention to aesthetics, function, reversibility for future owners.

Furthermore, drop tiles crack easily, I doubt they could tolerate the most minimual curvatures of the bus roof. Although hot glue is persuasive.

At a minimum, at least lay in a ceiling framework for the droptiles. Then you could come in later for HVAC or lighting upgrades, perhaps some cubicles.

Billy
