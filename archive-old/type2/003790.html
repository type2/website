I wanted to buy a set of Michelin Aligents locally.  Everyone said, &quot;No, not
available get.....&quot;

Tire Rack had them in stock, so I checked their installer  around here and
they said &quot;No, you can get...&quot;

After I told them (threatened them??) that Tire Rack would could deliver
them they were able to find them by the next day.

You figure it out.

&gt; &gt; On a different topic - I'm having lots of fun try to to buy a set of
tires
&gt; &gt; locally for $80 a tire or so.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I hesitate to order via Tire Rack or others because I don't want to pay
&gt; &gt; shipping and mounting and balancing. I'm leaning towards Michelins and
have
&gt; &gt; found several $80 tires but can't seem to get them locally. I am trying
to
&gt; &gt; get decent tires with the right load range so they'll be safe and last
long
&gt; &gt; enough.
