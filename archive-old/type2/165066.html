Subject: Re: [T2] re:decibel

I checked the r*dio sh*ck for one, and they have a $50 model. 
&gt; Does anyone know if this would be worth getting, ie is the thing accurate at 
&gt; all, or do you need to spend hundreds of dollars on one? I don't need it to 
&gt; be super accurate I guess, just relatively accurate-so I can tell if he 
&gt; stuff I do makes a difference or not. 

Find a car you like to ride in, like a nice European luxury sedan, or my wifes 1975 Volvo, and measure how loud it is with your $50 meter, at the same driving conditions, then shoot for the same in your bus.

I plan to measure a few other cars with the same meter to get a feel for how it feels at different measurements.

Right now I am thinking that it would be nice to get to 85dB under normal conditions at 55mph.

Today we are also planning to hook up a fancier meter that measures the SPL at different frequencies to target the problems better, sounds awful deep to me, but some of the bigger geeks at work are managing that part of it for me.

Use the $50.00 meter and do trial and error with inexpensive stuff, plus I will be sharing my results and hopefully that can eliminate some trial for others.
