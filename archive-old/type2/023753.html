Hi,

&gt; To get the hybrid concept down to zero

 There have been some interesting developments recently using liquid
fuels like alcohol or petrol in fuel cells. I think the concept is to
fit a unit between the fuel source and the fuel cell which can seperate
hydrogen (or whatever fuel the cell uses) from other components in
more conventional fuels. This would circumvent the distribution 
problems with introducing hydrogen filling stations. The result 
wouldn't be perfectly clean but would be more efficient than burning
petrol in an ic engine.

 I hope that this technology isn't 25 years off- I think it might be
closer than that if developments continue. I believe that the whole
concept of battery powered vehicles is flawed, barring a huge leap
forward in storage technology, and that similar limitations are
characteristic of multifuel and hybrid vehicles (whatever drive you
are using you have to carry the dead weight of the other system).

 What I think is workable, given a bit more progress in fuel cells,
is to replace the bus drivetrain with a dedicated electric system-
the gearbox would be replaced by an electric motor (say, 75KW), the
engine by the fuel cell (~50KW) and seperator and the fuel tank
would stay where it is. Probably there should be a small battery
pack which would be charged by regenerative braking and would 
provide a little additional power to supplement the fuel cell for
hills and acceleration.

 I hope this might be feasible inside a decade.

 The primary environmental benefit to using a bus is that it means
you don't need to build a new car- as has been alluded to on this
thread already, a significant amount of energy and raw materials
are used to build a new vehicle. Much better to build cars that
last indefinitely... problem is that doesn't offer a good business
model to the carmakers...

 My wife &amp; I run two cars- both over 20 years old. I hope the bus 
will last long enough to convert to fuel cell power someday. 
Meanwhile, I'm still working slowly towards a flat six!

Cheers,
	 W.
