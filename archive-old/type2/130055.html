I insure my 37 year old Porsche with American Collectors. It is stated 
value, requires you send in a complete set of photos, and is very 
reasonable cost. However, use of the vehicle is limited to 2500 miles per 
year and only for car events. You are not covered for street parking. 
Either within a secure garage or within the car event paddock. You cannot 
use the vehicle for daily or personal use. Do obtain and review in detail 
the policy limitations. Go to Hemmings for a good number of the special 
collector insurance providers. And don't fail to ask your current insurance 
provider about special policies they may have for stated value, limited 
use. Some do and some don't, but do ask you agent.
