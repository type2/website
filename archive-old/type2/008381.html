I know its slightly off-subject, but I've found in my experience
that my little 73 camper is harder to control safely in an emergency
than a normal car. The brakes are harder to push, lock up sooner, it
rolls more and is more vague in directional stability. Visibility
sideways and behind is poorer, its noisier, etc.

On 2 occasions, I was travelling at 40-45mph, and I had to do an
emergency stop in wet conditions. Once, a pedestrian (early in the
morning) stepped right out in front of me at a set of traffic lights.
I locked the wheels and lost steering, so I quickly cadence-braked
and changed direction slightly. It was one of those &quot;which way shall
I go, which way is the pedestrian going to go&quot; situations. I had to
release brakes a few more times 'cos it locked again. All in &quot;desparate
to stop&quot; mode (panic isn't quite the right word). (BTW I missed the
pedestrian).

I once remember somebody wrote on here that the correct way to brake is
to gently apply at first, then firmly apply, to avoid lock-ups. Sound
advice!

Seems that the heavier the car, the longer it takes to stop. I saw a
feature on Top Gear and they compared various cars on this. Land Rover
Discovery I think came out bad, Porsche 911 middle, Pug 106 the best!
