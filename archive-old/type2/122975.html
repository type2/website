Subject: Window A/C unit

OK -- I've been searching my archive and it's not hitting on any of the
terms I can think of.

My HD bit the big one last week and I lost my bookmarks. I had a link to a
VERY well done window A/C &quot;boot and hanger&quot; someone had done for hanging a
small A/C unit in the front window of a bus. I'm sure it was this list where I saw it.

Could someone please repost the link?

Thanks

Gerald
