Subject: needed engine plastic (not tin)

------=_NextPart_000_0064_01C1A123.2C9D05E0
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I am  looking for a piece of engine tin, actually plastic, on my =
(formerly) air conditioned bus (1973 Westy).
It is the curved plastic piece on the left rear corner and bolts to the =
surrounding engine 'frame'. It goes around where the dealer installed =
A/C used to be. I have found the replacement tin for this, but not the =
plastic. Without it, even with the engine seal, I would have a gaping =
hole. In all the salvaged busses I have seen (w/o A/C) this piece is =
part of the body, not a removable piece.
Any leads?
