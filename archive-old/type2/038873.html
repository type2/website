Subject:  wrong valve adjustment?

hello volks, 
my name is mannie and i am new to vws and busses.
i recently purchased a '74 bus /1800 engine and stock dual carbs.
did my first tuneup (as per muir) and adjusted the valve gaps.
they all seemed a little tight. i then replaced some push rod tube seals cause
they were leaking oil. i looked at the push rods and they look like the ones
described in the archives about hydrolic lifters finding their way into the 
1800 
engine. as i understand the archives, if my pushrods look to be the thickness
of a pencil and are steel and not aluminum, then i have hydrolic lifters.
that would require a different adjustment. is the pushrod method (aluminum or 
steel)
enough to id how i should adjust my valves?

this is my first post.
this list has been a great resource..i luv reading about other ppl and their 
busses
thanks in advance
mannie

p.s. is there an adopt a newbie program in albany, new york?
trying to take my time and do it right but kinda lost on this one
