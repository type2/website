Subject: NO BRAKES! foolow-up

As some of you pointed out (and as I realized laying awake last night) 
I left out some details.

The flex lines were new two years ago.  The brake pads are even newer, 
and (I seem to recall) fairly evenly worn comparing left to right last 
night.  The brake fluid level was a little low - maybe less than half - 
and I flushed through a whole bottle of brake fluid bleeding the 
system.  I got a few bubbles out in the process, but not great gobs of 
air, except maybe for the RF brake (top).

I was able to remove the LF calipers by prying them out.  It was really 
not much more difficult than what I remember doing in the past to 
replace them.

IIRC, I've had an annoying squeak ever since I replaced the front 
pads/repacked the front bearings.  It was worse at first, but settled 
out after a coupla months (daily driver).  At the time I considered 
that it was new pads wearing in, or more likely, poor wheel bearing 
adjustment.  I tried adjusting things a little tighter back then (last 
year), but that didn't seem to help.

As I said, the master cylinder is original to the bus.  It is REALLY 
crusty on the outside.
