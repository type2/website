Subject: Re: [T2] Point Resistance

Kind of off topic but I thought I would but in. I
bought 2 sets of new points from 2 completely
different vendors. In both sets, I found that when I
hooked them to an ohm meter that the resistance was
infinate no matter if the points were open or closed.
I found that tanking an emery board and inserting it
between the contacts and sanding them just a little
bit fixed this problem I was having a heck of a time
trying to figure out why I was getting no spark when
everything else in myignition system checked out and
was getting power. Just make sure to regap the points
after doing this to make sure the dwell is correct.
Any way, Have a great day!

David Kelly

&gt; &gt; I have a small engine analyzer that measures
&gt; 'point resistance'.
&gt; 
&gt; It checks how good the connection from the points to
&gt; ground is.
&gt; 
&gt; From the web, &quot;Turn the engine over until the points
&gt; are closed and then use
&gt; an ohmmeter to connect the meter to the primary
&gt; point lead and to ground. If
&gt; resistance reading is too high, the points are
&gt; burned and must be replaced&quot;.
