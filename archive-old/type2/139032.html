&gt; The difference is the 73-74 model years.  During those years the center
&gt; surface of the fan was machined flat so that the air pump drive assembly
&gt; could be bolted on top of it.  This also required the use of regular
&gt; (non-recessed-head) bolts of slightly longer length.

Ah.

&gt; Now for the speculative part - I am pretty sure I've seen recessed
&gt; allen-head bolts holding the fan on in 1972 model year busses.

Yes.

&gt; Not sure 
&gt; about 75-later,

Also yes.

&gt; but it wouldn't suprise me if a) the CV joint bolts were
&gt; exactly the same spec, and b) VW decided to use those after 1974 to attach
&gt; the fan to reduce the number of different fasteners required to build a bus.

The cv joint points are different metric size and shape.
