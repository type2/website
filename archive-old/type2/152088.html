&gt; This summer I developed a voice-activated system for opening and

&gt; The &quot;Matthew, open the westy roof please&quot; system works quite well, I
&gt; use it whenever I'm camping with the family. The  system was a lot of
&gt; fun to create and develope, but the maintenance costs are pretty
&gt; steep. ;-P

probably not a teen yet,  then as it gets older the machinery gets more
contakerous......

wonder if the T-5 will ever reach this side of the pond....saw a VW Rialto
camper on I-95 Friday,,,,,.....$$$$$$$ I'm sure but it looked nice at
55mph going the other way anyway
