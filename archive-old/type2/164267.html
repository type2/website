Subject: Type4 Exhaust Manifold Studs

I have to install a pair of exhaust manifold studs in the old 81 air cooled
motor. Its out and on the bench, so theoretically, its not too hard :-)
Threads look okay, gonna find out for sure tho.

I always ask the silly questions, as I am not new to engines, but I sure am
to the Type4, so can I just go to Napa and get the studs, or do I need
something VW specific? Napa lists two choices. No idea why I want one over
the other &lt;shrug&gt;

I just double nut it, to install?

Is there any kind of torque setting for it, or will the stud bottom out?

Loctite? Blue, Red, or what?

I would appreciate any input or suggestions, so I can get it right the first
time. I know its probably as easy as it looks, just want to hear from those
who have done it.

Thanks,

John
