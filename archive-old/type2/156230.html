Subject: Front Sway Bar Mounting Kits

I'm down to the last piece in the process of replacing the front beam on my '69 Westy: the sway
bar (stock sway bar).  When I removed the sway bar, I didn't even try to save the mounting clamps,
as they were rusted as heck.  They met the business end of a 4&quot; angle grinder.

I opened up the sway bar mounting kits (from Bus Boys, p/n 21145091A, made in Brazil) that I
ordered a few months back.  Neither the clamps nor the rubber bushings look anything like the
pieces I took off.  The holes in the rubber bushings are too large (in my opinion) and have a bit
a slop when installed on the sway bar.  They also are a different shape than the originals and
seem to be too long.  The brackets have a weird &quot;arched&quot; shape and I don't really see how they
could be installed.

The searches I've done confirm others have had this experience with sway bar mounting kits, but no
one has mentioned if there is a &quot;good&quot; one, or at least one that is closer to what's needed. 
Wolfsburg West, CIP, and The Bus Depot all have kits that appear to be very close (at least in the
picture) to what was originally on the bus.

Any suggestions on where to get some better parts?
