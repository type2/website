Pat-
 not enough info here to make an accurate diagnosis.
evidently you have had some work done , on top of some previous work done.
your most pressing problem would seem to be excessive
compression cutting of the cylinder heads, and the subsequent
alteration of valve train geometry, with an attempt at a solution by way
of shimming the cylinder base in an attempt to regain that geometry.
this changes the deck height, and begins a circular compounding of the
problem.
my most direct solution for you is to replace those cylinder heads...
