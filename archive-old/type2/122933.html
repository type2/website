Subject: VW van, how to tighten side view mirrors?

Hello,

Rich from Grass Valley CA here.

The side view mirrors are loose on my 72 bus.  The ball type pivot that they 
are attached to
is too loose, and the wind will blow them out of adjustment.

Is there an easy fix for this?  I don't see any way to dismantle the 
mirrors.  I've tried taping
them but it works only temporarily.

Thanks,
Rich
