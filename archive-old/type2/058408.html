Subject: For Sale, Chattanooga, TN

I have the following Busses for sale:

1966 (I think), no interior, no engine, does have the drivers seat, comes
with 2 extra sets of bumpers, good transmission (from what I was told) major
rust, this bus could probably be put back on the road, but is not a
candidate for restoration, $200.00

1971 Westy, Bad engine, bad canvis, not too much rust on this one, no
sink/ice box unit, missing headliner and                     wall panels,
good transmission, $850.00

1972 Transporter, not running but engine turns over by hand (it's a 1700
engine), missing middle seat, it is a walk-through.  Has nose damage to
passenger side, above headlight.  $500.00

1972 Sunroof, no engine or trans or CV's, strange camper interior, missing
front seats, front window cracked, good                      for parts and
not much else.  It has little rust, so it would be a good metal donor.

All busses are located in LaFayette, GA, about 20 miles south of
Chattanooga, TN.  If you are interested, please espond to this e-mail
address and to my home address (vwstuart_at_webtv_dot_net).  Electronic photos
avaliable to e-mail if you are interested.

Thanks,
Stuart Neil
