Subject: Re: [T2] replacing Solex 30 PICT with 34 PICT

&gt; &gt; I suspect that the Solex 30 PICT-3 carb on my single port 1600 needs to be
&gt; &gt; rebuilt.  I have a spare rebuilt 34 PICT-3 but I don't know if the two are
&gt; &gt; interchangable without any significant modifications.  Can anyone clear

&gt; Personally, I'd go with a new 31PICT-3 carb over trying to adapt the 34.
&gt; Yes, it's more money, but it's a bolt-on and the carb works great.  Mine
&gt; ran great right out of the box (bought from Ronnie) and still does two
&gt; years later.


Also I think the 34pict3 is the fidgety-est damn solex ever.
