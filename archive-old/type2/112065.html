&gt; Just adding my observations from the CHT, OT, OP gauges I have on my '77

&gt; I can regulate either temperature independently with how I drive. I have
&gt; noticed CHT increases with low vacuum (foot to the floor driving), and OT
&gt; increases with high revs.

This seems reasonable, since CHT is a function of the power produced (it
comes mostly from the fire of combustion) and the OT is more a function of
the friction of the pistons and cylinders.
