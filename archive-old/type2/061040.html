--&gt; I always thought that a US gallon was 16 fluid ounces and an imperial
gallon 20 but the UNIX units program quotes an imperial gallon as 4.55
litres and a US gallon as 3.79 suggesting that your fluid ounces are a
different size as well...which leaves me too confused to try and work out
the factors...


I believe it's true that a pint of water is either 16 or 20 ounces, (do they
call them pints in US) and a litre of water weighs 1 kg, but forget that if
you're dealing with any other fluid. Specific gravity comes into play.

Your other figures look OK though
