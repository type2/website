&gt; I feel your pain.  I live in a 97 year-old condo (my building and the
&gt; entire neighborhood was pretty much built right after the 1906
&gt; earthquake) ... we have a garage, but it and most other garages in the
&gt; area are not tall enough for a Westy!  (They're all slightly lower than
&gt; the sidewalk, and the rear of the pop-top catches about 6 inches in
&gt; from the rear -- if I could pull in level, I could probably make it.)

hmmmm, would it go into the garage if you let some air out of the tires,
wouldn't be very convienent for daily parking but the occasional major
repair or to get it off the street for a few days it might work.
