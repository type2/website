Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Seized

Jim,

Serious bummer....I sympathize.

You won't know what happened until you take the engine out and apart.

Do *not* attempt to turn it until you take it apart.  I ruined a case once 
trying to do that.

Slight glimmer of hope...pull the fan belt off and see if it will turn.

I had the same thing(except for the oil pressure part) happen to me
once and it was the generator that had siezed.  Flipped the fan belt
off and then I could turn it.

What have you got on the engine(parts wise)..stock oil pump and cooler?

Still penty of oil?

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hello listers:
&gt; 
&gt; No, not taken away, but seized as in frozen, not turning, bus sitting in the
&gt; driveway, upsetting my wife kind of seized.  Here's the details:
&gt; 
&gt; Brand new Type 1 engine in a 71 Bus, about 350 miles.  I built it myself,
&gt; and it was running great.  The first 300 miles or so I only drove it on
&gt; surface streets, so I could vary the RPM to seat the rings.  Friday night I
&gt; drove it on the freeway for the first time, and it ran great for about 35
&gt; miles, then I started seeing a drop of oil pressure, from about 50PSI to
&gt; 20PSI, then it fluctuated up and down between 20 and 40 PSI.  This lasted
&gt; about 10 miles, and I figured it was a bad connection on the oil pressure
&gt; sender or something like that.  Suddenly, my oil pressure dropped to 0PSI,
&gt; and I still figured it was a bad connection, so I kept driving the last 5
&gt; miles home.  Yesterday, I went to start my bus, and the engine barely wanted
&gt; to turn over.  It sounded like it was really straining to turn, but it
&gt; finally started up, and ran for about 10 seconds, then died suddenly.  This
&gt; time it wouldn't even turn over, I could just hear the starter motor trying
&gt; to turn, but it couldn't.  I tried turning the motor by hand, using a wrench
&gt; on the pulley bolt, but it's definitely seized.  
&gt; 
&gt; So, I screwed up by driving that last 5 miles with no oil pressure, and
&gt; maybe I'll be able to sit down by the end of the week, after all the kicking
&gt; myself in the butt stops.  The big question is, do I now own a $2000 paper
&gt; weight shaped like a VW engine, or can I save this thing?  I've never had a
&gt; seized engine of any kind, so I have no idea what to do, or what to expect
&gt; to see when I open the case.  I'd really appreciate the help of my fellow
&gt; listees on this one, since this has put me at the crossroads of VW Bus
&gt; ownership.  My wife has told me if this means buying a new engine, then the
&gt; Bus gets towed to the nearest junkyard.  Translated, this means I'll be
&gt; having my Bus towed to my brother's house, where I'll be living until my
&gt; wife either cools off and takes me back, or divorces me and my Bus.  Either
&gt; scenario sucks.  Please advise, I'll listen to any and all tidbits of info,
&gt; advice, consolation, etc....
