&gt; Hi,
&gt;  
&gt;  I Bought some nice Jalousie windows(garden variety three pane) from  Crazy
&gt;  DaveE at EveryBus. I am gonna install them in the '72 Westfakia. I was
&gt;  advised to drill holes in the window frame of the bus and use common sheet
&gt;  metal screws for the install. It appears that the screws just lock
&gt;  themselves into the track in the Jal window frame.  Does anyone have any
&gt;  advice on what size screws work best? Also, are there any galvanic
&gt;  consideration when chooseing the screws?

Chris, the screws are #6  3/8&quot; Pan Head Phillips Zinc Plated.  You should not 
have any problems with galvanic action.  There are six on the long sides and 
two on the short.  Check the window to see where the original holes were, but 
you don't have to put them in the same place.  Might even be stripped there.  
Could put as many screws in as you like.  Holes are drilled very close to the 
edge of the window frame lip.  Don't overtighten.

I also just got a childs cot, but my clips were already installed.  Problem 
is, the front clips seem to be too close together so the pole is about 1/8&quot; 
too long to go in.  Never been in an accident, and original windshield is in 
until just recently, so the body should be straight.  I think maybe the clips 
were factory installed slightly too high up?  Could the poles have gotten 
longer?  They had been bent and I straightened them.  Anybody have any ideas? 
 The rear pole snaps in nice and snug.
