I dunno...  cinder blocks work pretty well for me.

My first pull was an emergency-type deal while on the road; used a
bunch of bricks and a block of wood or two that I collected from
behind a motel.  Then pulled it in their parking lot. :)

Haven't pulled the tranny yet, though; it might be handy for that.
