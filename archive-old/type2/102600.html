On a good day.

Very reliably, and probably with more torque at a lower RPM.

&gt; So, they all seem to offer very close HP ratings ..... Am I right? What is
&gt; the big advantage of type 4 engines other than Fuel injection and hydraulic
&gt; lifters? Especially when it seems the cost of parts is like double that of a
&gt; type 1 engine.

Type IVs are a newer design with many refinements.  They will last much
longer in a bus application.  The bottom ends are very strong and don't
pound out like a type 1.
