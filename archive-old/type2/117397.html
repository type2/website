&gt; &gt; I have a fuel pressure gauge connected,, and it stays at about 32 psi
&gt; &gt; constantly  +/- 2 psi while running
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have counted out fuel pressure at this point

I wouldn't it really sounds like the double relay not switching from start
mode to run mode,  try this, put a pencil in the AFM to hold the flap open
just a little bit....see if it keeps running....

&gt; The position of the vacuum can on the distributor doesn't look right to me.
&gt; Something is screwy about the timing.

maybe but then it shouldn't start at all??
