Hi Folks,
   Earlier Rawls Moore asked about what kind of oil everyone uses.  Well I 
used to use straight weight oil, in an appropriate viscosity for the season, 
until I found out what the second number in multigrade oils stands for.  
Evidently the second number is the qualities of the oil at 100 degrees C.  
For instance 20W50 oil is a 20 weight oil at ambient temperature, but at 100 
degrees C has the same viscosity of a 50 weight which is at 100 degrees C.  
So, while the viscosity of a multi-grade oil doesn't actually go up with 
temp., it doesn't go down as fast as a straight weight oil.  This is 
achieved by the use of additives in the oil.
   So now I use a good quality, multi-grade oil appropriate for the expected 
seasonal temperatures.
