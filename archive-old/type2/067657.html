Subject: Yank gallons &amp; Canadian Litres

&gt;Hence the question, Brian.  Yes, there are Yank gallons, and Imperial
&gt;Gallons.  And, for quite a while, I would drive up to Vancouver, B.C.
&gt;to get my gas - because it was cheaper.  Then, sometimes, I would see
&gt;Canadians driving down to Pt. Roberts, Washington to buy gas, because
&gt;it was cheaper THERE, sometimes.
&gt;
Cool. I lived in Pt. Bob for a year (off Province rd.), worked at the
Marina, Marketplace and a small restaurant gone long ago called &quot;The
Hawthornes&quot;. My sister is the deputy Park Ranger at Lighthouse Park (for the
past I dunno 4 or 5 years... I start to lose track of things). What a small
world.
BTW, Gas on the point is sold by the litre &lt;=note Canadian spelling... Has
been for about 5 years now... I guess to accomodate the &quot;cheeseheads&quot; :&gt;
(What we would call the Canadians heading down to the point for cheap gas
and cheese... HEY TILLAMOOK (Sp?) CHEESE ROCKS!!)
Anyways, I am surprised at the lack on information on gas tank size in the
repair manuals... they make a pretty good point to explain it all in the
Owner's manual. Maybe since I have already made a copy of my Westy manual,
My Owner manuals (part 1 and 2), you might like a copy. There is some neat
information in there... especially in the &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; manual.
