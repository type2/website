Subject: Re: [T2] BAttery drain

go to a pawn shop or radio shack or your tool box and get yourself a
multimeter and set it on the smallest currents/amps setting.  pull a
battery connection off of your battery and hook up the meter between the
battery cable and the battery.  if the battery is draining like you suspect
you'll see a number of some value on the screen.   write this number down
and then start pulling fuses one by one until the number goes to zero.
once it is zero then you'll know at least what circuit path the drain is
in.  like another person said, if you have a modern radio it takes a bit of
current when off but not too much and it would take more than a couple
weeks to drain a good battery.

Is there a way to tell whether or not &quot;juice&quot; is being
sucked out of your battery when apparentl nothing is
on??
