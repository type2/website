&gt; I'm not trying to be argumentative. However, the solution to your &quot;problem&quot;
&gt; is staring you right in the face. Remove the rear tin, and drive it. If the

I have found in testing that the ONLY time it helps to open the rear
engine comp door is in slow city stop and go driving, and then it is only
a very little help. other than that it is always a hotter engine without
all the tin in place, seals tight, and the door closed.

YMMV
