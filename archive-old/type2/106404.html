Subject: RE: [T2] Aftermarkey wheels for a Bay

&gt; As for you bob... yes and no.. Physics apply but rules can be bent... do
&gt; a conversion over on the link I gave earlier (
&gt; http://www.miata_dot_net/garage/tirecalc.html ). if you go from a stock VW
&gt; tire (185X60x14) and go to a larger rim and tire say a 215X50X16 the
&gt; difference is about 7.6% to slow or a speedometer difference of about

No. not 185/60 but 185/none/14.
I looked up a typical 215/50/16. Firehawk. 850 revs per mile. much smaller
than a stock 14 inch tire. 5% smaller than yoko 356s.


&gt; 4.5 miles faster at 60mph. so if your speedo say 60 you are doing 64.5
&gt; mph. but your engine is only working as hard as it did before to get to
&gt; 60 on the older rims and tires.

No your wrong here too. The work is the same. But the engine turning
slower  could be an advantage depending on your driving habits
and location.
