&gt; &gt;From: Access Systems I've been looking for 12 years, haven't found mine.
&gt; &gt;from what I recently
&gt; &gt;discovered is that on the 010 auto tranny the switch is in the shifter at
&gt; &gt;the front, the older tranny had it on the tranny itself,  but I still
&gt; &gt;haven't found the switch.
&gt;
&gt; Then that makes sense of the last post I made. But I can't find the fuse.

not sure if it had a fuse other than on the fuse block

&gt; Did the older tranny used a vacuum switch to work the lights? The switch
&gt; seems to be in the shifter or it is at least a mechanical/electrical switch,
&gt; no vacuum of course the older auto tranny could be the same way and no

it was a mechanical switch inside the tranny

&gt; vacuum. The only thing I know now is that my lights work and play with the
&gt; shifter flickers the lights.

good hint

&gt; Will let you know where I find it if I do,

thanks

Bob
