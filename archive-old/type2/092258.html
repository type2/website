Subject: Re: [T2] timing question

Ah-hah!

Now I think we can help you find the right vacuums for the ports on your
Dizzy can.  Having a '79 you probably have F/I or duel carbs and I
haven't played with this set up yet.  I copied the list again (my first
reply was off list) so maybe someone else can chime in.  I've only delt
with duel vacuum on Type 1 engines.

You need two types of sources.  

1. The vacuum is off at idle and comes on right after you open the
throttle.  This source will go to the advance side of the vacuum can
(the side away from the dizzy cap and probably smaller in size).

2. The vacuum is on only at idle and goes away as soon as the throttle
opens.  This source will go to the retard side which is the side closest
to the dizzy cap.

My (limited) understanding is that the retard was added to heat the
heads up at idle to cause a cleaner burn.  Idle seems to be less
efficient.  As I said my understanding is limited so take that with the
proper grain of salt.

Anyway, Once you get the vacuum sources sorted out and hooked up, you
should be able to set timing correctly.  Hopefully someone else can tell
you where to hook what.

Good luck!

&gt; Ah... this sheds some light on things!  I believe it is a dual vacuum
&gt; dizzy and I have some vacuum problems.  Thanks for the info.  Also, now I
&gt; realize that the design change from previous years was because of an
&gt; emissions.

&gt; &gt; Mike,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Does your new Dizzy have a double vacuum can?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You may know this but it doesn't look like anyone has addressed it.  The
&gt; &gt; 5deg ATDC is normally if you have the vacuum retard for emissions.  The
&gt; &gt; indicator would be two vacuum nipples on the can.  Unlike a single
&gt; &gt; vacuum advance dizzy where you set the timing for 7.5deg BTDC, with a
&gt; &gt; dual vacuum dizzy you leave both connected and set timing for 5deg
&gt; &gt; ATDC.  If you were to disconnect the retard side you should be able to
&gt; &gt; see timing go to 7.5deg BTDC at idle.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So, if you have a single vacuum dizzy, then 7.5 BTDC is correct and that
&gt; &gt; is why it runs well there.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Make any sense or am I out in left field?
