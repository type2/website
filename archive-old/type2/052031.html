&gt;I have never even considered going into a VW

&gt;I have been to the dealership across the river in
&gt;Nuevo Laredo and they have always been nice and
&gt;helpful. They even gave me a partsbook! 
&gt;On one occasion they looked up ambulance fans for me
&gt;and they were still available. The cost kept me from
&gt;placing and order, though. I could buy another bus for
&gt;that kind of money!

And if it included a set of original ambulance fans, the odds are they
would still be function nominal after 30 years of use. The price they
quoted you is the cost to create such durability today, so as to meet the
original, genuine VW specifications of yesteryear.

Note they gave you a free reference, spent their time to help find what you
wanted, in your words, &quot;nice and friendly&quot;, and in return they get NO SALE,
value not recognized by market. You may appreciate their attitude and thank
them for their help. Some of the market will call them crooks as they leave
with the freebee information.

It's no suprize that some VW parts people get a bit jaundised and find it
hard to be 'nice and friendly' with too much of this outrage from the
'cheap VW' croud. They want the value of the original equipment but refuse
to pay for it, even when it is scarcely available on special order, further
enhancing value.

It always costs more time/money to do things right as opposed to pretending
to do things right.
One is reality which insures results, the other is facade which substitutes
value in fact with value perceived as low price for it's own sake, damn the
results.

My sence is a majority of this list know the difference, a much higher %
than the VW croud generally.
