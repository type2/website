from my experience citrus based hand cleaner (w/ or w/o added abrasive in it) is very good at cleaning greasy parts etc.

obviously the particulars will dictate if you want to use an abrasive in the citrus cleaner.

for the final stages you can either wipe it off w/ a damp cloth or wash it off.

hard plastic disposable spatulas are also good for scraping off tuffer grime but does not scratch paint underneath car.

just my $0.02
