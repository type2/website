I accidentally broke one blade on my cooling fan when taking my engine apart
(2L). Can that cause any problem in the balance of the engine?
thanks

&gt; &gt;I thought I'd mention that I just spent a couple hours cleaning the fan on
&gt; my 1700cc type4 engine. It was black and covered with a hard, crusty grime.
&gt; Seemed to me that a clean fan might help the bus run cooler.

&gt; Hey Rich, I just had the same entertainment.  I figured that if the hollows
&gt; of the blades cake up with gunk, they won't suck as much air.  So we'll see,
&gt; maybe now our fans will be more efficient as well as more attractive.
