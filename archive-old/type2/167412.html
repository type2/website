Subject: Re: [T2] windshield sill woes

Hi James,

Sounds to me like the water is getting between the seal and the body.

When I installed the windshield on my bus I used roofing tar between  
the seal and sill to help keep it from leaking. I would have thought  
that silicone would be better but it has acidic byproducts and will  
eat the paint... not good! Tar will melt and re-seat itself whenever  
the weather gets warm and that helps keep the seal intact.

Pull the windshield and I bet the sill is just fine. Put it back in  
with some tar in there and you'll be good to go.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Well I thought I had fixed my problems with my windshield
&gt; I filled the holes in the sill but after a couple rains here the
&gt; last week water is coming in over what appears the sill and
&gt; is sitting on my dash.
&gt;
&gt; I think the lip of the sill collapsed or something.
&gt; Now I have to find someone other than myself to fix it
&gt; and doing some welding.
