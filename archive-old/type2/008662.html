Help! - I just can't get seem to get the these things to seat properly. 
The Haynes and Wilson book just says push them in, but it ain't (at least
for me) that easy.  Muir says to use visegrips on the tube and bang them
- Well I'm not going to follow that route (although that was necessary to
remove the originals)  These are new tubes, seals and I lubed them.  I
put a large washer on the end on the tube and banged that, put even
still, it just doesn'e seem to go in as far as one wihout seals installed
