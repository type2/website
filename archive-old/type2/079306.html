Subject: Re: [T2] DOT 5

well i am far from an expert, but i'll give my .02 on this.

dont put this stuff in the brake system on your bus.  it wasnt made for it.

&amp; yes, whatever article you read was correct at least on one point. you will
have to _completely_ flush your old system of any DOT 4 or 3. &amp; from what i
understand that means perfectly clean of all old fluid. that could be quite
a chore. the DOT 5 is also very expensive.

so yes, it can be used but i think any performance enhancement would be
offset by the work you would have to do to get DOT 5 into your brake system.

just MHO.  YMMV.
