Subject: Exhaust leaks and Cooling tin

Hey Y'all,

I just had an exhaust leak fixed on my '75 just 3-4 months ago and it
has returned.  Arugghh!  I think I know the reason why.  Please somebody
tell me if I'm wrong, but I found that the cooling tin that normally
lies under the left-hand exhaust pipe is missing.  Would this un-even
cooling cause enough of a temp gradient to revitalize an exhaust leak?  

Initially, I should have fixed the leak myself and I would have found
the missing tin myself.  However, I was in a pinch due to time
constraints and had to take it to a shop.  Oh the humanity!

Please P-mail me.  I'm on digest mode.

Thanks,

Pete
