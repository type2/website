Subject: [T2] single cab gate hinges

Hello,
A good friend of mine recently picked up a 68 shorty single cab with an
1835 stuffed in the back...widened 15&quot; rims in the back with big
swampers on them and all...oh yeah...and a camo paint job that actually
looks really good.  We went to put the shortened gates on
yesterday...and realized we don't have all of the hinges...
If anyone has any hinges that would fit on this...we could use 3 or 4 of
them... or if you have just the hinge bottoms (the part that screws on
the bed with 2 screws).
If you have any...let me know.  I don't know if splits used the
same...so I cross posted.

Thanks!
Isaiah
