Subject: Q: How to lap cylinders &amp; Resurface flywheel

I'm rebuilding the top end of my 1700, 2liter case
(powers my 72 Westy).

I'm going to run it without head gaskets, so I'm using
the necessary spacers. Is there someone who can tell
me the correct way to lap in the cylinders to the
heads?  So far, I've used permatex valve grinding
compound, and rotated back and forth through about 45
degrees about 200 times on each cylinder.  I remember
hearing something about rotating a full 360 degrees,
but I went ahead and worked them where they're going
to set. They seem to seat well, but I did not notice
much difference in surface finish.   The finish on
both the heads and the cylinders looks like alot of
concentric grooves, like a tree cross section.  Should
the compound be able to take it down to a smooth,
almost reflective finish or are they good enough as
is?  

I've got a question about resurfacing the flywheel
also.  I'm using 220 silicon carbide paper to rough up
the surface, at 45 degrees each way.  The surface is
still somewhat reflective, but not mirror like as when
I started.  (I'm replacing the rear seal, I think
there was a small amount of oil leakage).  Is that
sufficient, or should I polish it with some 600 grit?
Some earlier postings recommend having it resurfaced
at a shop.

Thanks
