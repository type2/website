Subject: Pre-Bentley Manual

Had a good morning at the Flea market...

	found a 1968-1978 Type II manual (no mention of Bentley on the green
cover) that has the color wiring diagrams for $8 in VGC..

	Same vendor had the yellow cover type II manual for 1978 model year
only (had a 1/2 dozen or so Service bulletins in the back) for the same
$8... also had a couple of the Clymers Manual for 411/412 $5 ea...

	one fellow had a router set-up that my dad may want me to go back for,
so I may pick up the other type II manual and one of the 411 manual...  

	didn't notice if the '78 manual had color wiring diagrams...

	will let ya'll know if I pick these up as I have no use for the '78
book (I have a '73 westy), but may keep the bulletins...

	Take care...
