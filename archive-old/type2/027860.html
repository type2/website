Hi,

     I have a BN4 that I installed in my engine compartment that works quite 
well.  I have another one that I was thinking of installing in-line with the 
old heater tube so I could get heat up front.  I no longer have heater 
boxes, heater fan or the tubing.  Replacing all this would be a huge effort 
and expense.  Is a BN4 much different than a BA4?  Would it be possible to 
have 2 heaters installed if I only ran one at a time or had an auxilary 
battery?  I also would like more information about how you installed your 
BA4.  Any advice would be much appreciated.  Thanks,

James
