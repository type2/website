Subject: Re: [T2] Bringing the Bus home.

&gt;From: &quot;daniel nelson&quot; Yea it's a GEX engine but hey it's a complete running 
&gt;engine right? Why not do adjust valves, do a compression test, check for 
&gt;endplay, and get a feel for what condition it's in? Check everything out 
&gt;before you drop it, test the gen and stuff. Replace that oil cooler seal 
&gt;while messing with the cooling issue at the same time for sure.

&gt;I think you could turn it into a strong driver without much money at all - 
&gt;don't be discouraged and assume you have to immediately replace the entire 
&gt;engine just because it's GEX. And from that pic the bus looks pretty solid, 
&gt;especially for being from New Jersey (when I first read that I was confused 
&gt;why you were going to NJ to pick up a bus).


My thoughts exactly. Most that have follwed my engine refresh know that it 
was indeed a GEX. It still is not running due to the FI issues I have not 
finished, but before I started it all it was a good engine. It ran fine with 
the .009 and the single weber. Also those flaps were gone. The mouse nest on 
top of the fins of the cyllinders and a host of other problems. These can 
all be found on stock engines that DPOs didn't take care of. When I get back 
on the road I will post my comments regularly via trip report. I am not 
saying I am proud of the GEX in my bus, just thankful I decide to dig in and 
take a look.
