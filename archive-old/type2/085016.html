Subject: Re: side tent question

Sorry to hear of your pole problems, Jenny - I hope you get things squared away with the seller.  Depending on what's missing, you can fab something.  See these 
URLs for ideas:

http://www_dot_canopymasters_dot_com/fittings_page.htm

Note:  Jamie gave you the URLs of a couple of items on my site but from your description (no floor) it sounds like you have what I call a &quot;Big Top&quot; tent, which is 
slightly different from the later ones.  See http://www.supernet_dot_net/~jclark/vw/splits.html#4.  This is a tent originally for buses of the '65-67 era, but as far as I can 
tell it would fit others.

Jamie asked about the red/green color coding on the poles and which ones face the bus (now referring again to the later drive-away tent).  I forget which ones, but 
the easiest way to tell is to look at the peak (t-shaped) and corner poles.  When the frame is up, there's a definite pitch away from the bus -- ie, slightly higher next to 
the bus so water runs off the top away from the bus and you have a tad more headroom next to the bus.  If you look at the red vs. green sets of peak and corner 
poles you can see that they're not identical -- put the ones next to the bus that will cause this downward slope away from the car.

Hope that helps.

Now you've got me all excited -- I'm leaving Sunday for 4 nights of camping on the Gulf Coast and it'll be the first time I've used my Drive-Away tent in almost a year.
