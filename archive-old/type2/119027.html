Subject: More tranny help

background
On a 73 body I installed a 78 tranny.  I couldn't get 2nd or 4th gear.
I adjusted the rod at the adjusting screw about 12 to 18 inches back from
the front rubber coupler. If you look in your bentley go to transmission
and rear axle page 9 fig3-13 and you,ll see the coupling I'm talking
about, one tube fits inside the other so thats the easyist to adjust
rather than cutting off a peice.

Well I have 2nd and 4th now  :)  but somehow lost 3rd.  I thought I'd be
able to adjust that by adjusting the plate under the shifter, but after
removing the shifter am totally lost.  I have read the Bentley chapter 6 pg
10 and don't understand.  Can anyone explain this to me in reference to what
I am trying to do.  Get all 4 gears.

Also, I guess this is a 2 man job or is there a trick to get the nuts back
on the bolts that hold the shifter on.

Thanks in advance for any help,
Snoopy
