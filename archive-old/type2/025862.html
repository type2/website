&gt; I was reading Muir last night, and he recommended to change the tranny
&gt; fluid every 30,000 miles. Since I have never done this, and I am sure the
&gt; PO didn't either it has been at least that long. I wanted to find out how
&gt; much was required and how to do it, so I checked Bently, and it states that
&gt; changing the fluid is not required after 1970.

5.7 pints, same as the engine.

And though it may not be &quot;required,&quot; it's still a good idea.
