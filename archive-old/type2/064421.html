Subject: Non California 75 Campmobile: Muffler Problems

Found the problem with my muffler, it has a hole in the connector pipe on
the drivers side.  So I decide to order the OEM replacement plus muffler,
gasket and tail pipe by Dansk from California Imports. Then I recheck the
muffler and it has connections on both sides.  H. Steve if your out there
maybe this is why I have two places to recieve air from that area in the
rear.  One connected to the air filtration system on the passenger side
and the other plugged with a sponge on the drivers side?  
So I call Cal Imports, no clue but said no problem returning.   Then I call
RMMW's and if you have the catalog I think I have on my bus now #4 on
page 20 except it only has one tailpipe and it is coming off the passenger
side. By the way the # 2 and #4 are mislabeled. Just switch the two
labels.
If someone out there has a recommendation let me know. I need to be
spoon fed. I'm a bonehead for ordering ahead of time anyways.
