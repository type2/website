Subject: Accelerator Pump

I'm cleaning solt out of my carb, a 34 Pict-3 and have nearly cleaned all 
the passageways (the stuff was like concrete !) except that betwwn the main 
tank into the accelerator pump. I've arrowed the top in this picture:

I have managed to clear a passage by wiggling wire down it but want to make 
sure it's proerly clear. I'll drill it out but need to know how big a bit to 
use. What is the size of the hole at the bottom of the brass fitting (you 
can see the top on the pic) ? Bently is sadly lacking in this information.

Thanks

Phil
