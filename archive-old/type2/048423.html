I'm not that familiar with the L-Jetronic stuff, but every other FI I
have worked on had a fuel pressure regulator.  It's basically a spring
loaded diaphram just down stream of the fuel pump which maintains fuel
pressure to the injectors with the fuel pump off.  One test for this
part is to turn the key to on and allow the fuel pump to build pressure
for a few seconds prior to engaging the starter.

good Luck.
