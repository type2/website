Not on the ones I've seen photos of, which had remote filters mounted
forward by frame members, but it makes sense. How deep is the sandwich
plate? If it makes the filter hang too far below the sump, it would
still be exposed, but with no way to shield it.

Incorrect on the filter block off.  You use a sandwich plate, and your
filter stays in the same spot.
