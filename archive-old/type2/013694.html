higher octane rating is only a reflection of a fuel's resistance to
knock in the engine. it has no more power. Only a different blend of
hydrocarbons and possibly detergent (if the gas co doesn't put that in
the lower fuels). It only burns slower helping with the knocking in some
situations.

&gt; your mpg is the same with both fuels, the exact same amount of heat must be 
&gt; disspelled which means that one should not cause your engine to run hotter 
&gt; than the other.  Now if someone can prove to me that they get better mpg 
&gt; with higher octane fuel, I might be inclined to believe the engine runs 
&gt; cooler also.
