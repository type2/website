Subject: Re: [T2] headlight switches

I wonder is this switch really made in the US, or some old stock from Europe
or something? Wonder why they'd have some obscure terminals nobody's ever
heard of to park your vehicle at night with the left or right parking lights
on? Why would they have repopped that setup instead of the more common ones
that were actually sold here?

&lt;58L and 58R come on whenever 58 does.

If I can ever get VWG to return my call perhaps this can be sorted out...

&lt;This was a switch used for some time in Germany. You could leave the
parking ligt either for the right or left side on depend on which side of
the street you park over night. Reason is for less battery withdraw.
