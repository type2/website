Subject: Re: [T2] Bolts needed to attach pressure plate to 215mm 
  flywheel

Hi Volks,

I  was able to get 20mm M7 bolts from a local fastener supply house... 
but they wound up referring me to the national warehouse (Luckily it 
was only 4 miles away) where they had 27 bolts in stock.

I bought a dozen, since they have a minimum order of $10 and I think I 
might have another 215mm flywheel at home somewhere.

Moral of the story: M7's are not commonly available. So when you pull 
apart a clutch and flywheel, bag the bolts and tie them to the flywheel 
for future reference. Same goes for the slide tube that supports the 
throw-out bearing... At BusFusion I found out the hard way that it uses 
M7 bolts as well.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt;&gt; No, 215 bolts are 7mm.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 210 and 228 are 8mm.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The correct 215 bolts are triple-square. They are 7 x 1.0 x 20mm
