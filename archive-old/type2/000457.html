I have a snap on digital timing light that I can set the adv/ret degrees and
then time to tdc.
so is there an exact number for idle and full advance?  what idle speed?
what advance speed?


009
static timing between 7.5 and 10 deg BTDC
If you have a timing light this will give a max total advance of 28-30
degrees. careful with more.
