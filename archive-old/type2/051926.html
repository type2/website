Subject: [T2]Vac. dizzy and dual carb question

hi, 
I recently installed a rebuilt 1600dp in my 71 westy and everything is
going well so far.  I have everything hooked up except for the
distributor and the dual weber 40 dcnfs.  I had the manifolds drilled
and tapped for the vacuum booster hoses and I was wondering where I
could place a port for the vacuum operated distributor I was reccomended
to use.  Jim at the old volks home was very helpful in telling me that
the best distributor in my case would be the one from the 74 fed. MT
beetles.  My carbs dont have any holes or fittings where I could attach
a vacuum hose.  I was wondering if anyone knew where I should drill the
carbs for the vacuum hose--or should I drill the manifolds or what.  Any
response will be greatly appreciated and thanks in advance.  Brian 71
