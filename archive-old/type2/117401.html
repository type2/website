&gt; Hey guys, I've got more of a general question here.. what is the third guage
&gt; cluster hole for? You know the one that's to the right of the speedometer?
&gt; Of all the VW Busses I've seen in the junkyard, it's been completely empty
&gt; with vents or something on the inside.. but still behind the clear plastic
&gt; glass.

in the deluxe buses it had a clock, highly desirable but still sort of
avalliable in the used market,
