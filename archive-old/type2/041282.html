Looks like we have quite a bit in commom here, Dan.  I use to live on the 
Olympic Peninsula (Port Angeles), up until 3 1/2 yrs ago.   I'm originally 
from 30 miles west of Cleveland (yuk).  I never wore shoes then and I still 
don't.  I've only been kicked out of one grocery store over the years and it 
was in Oklahoma, of all places.

My SO won't ride in her either.  He wanted to move her out of the driveway 
one day, and the Ford mechanic himself couldn't find reverse.  That makes me 
smile just a little 
; - ) .........  My own little private joke (not so private anymore).  When I 
get my scanner operating, I'll send a picture of her.  She's stock inside and 
out and still in excellent shape except for some surface rust along the 
windshield rubber.  And it seems as though I had mice living in the canvas 
for a while when she was broken down.  I have a couple of chew holes.

You take care and I'll talk to you later.
Connie
