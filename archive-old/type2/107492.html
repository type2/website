Subject: RE: [T2] What causes a 30# compression reading?

I would guess (but not sure) that 30# is pretty low for a ring problem. When
my #4 exhaust valve seat started to go, the valve stem stuck up higher than
the intake when at TDC(compression stroke). Remove the valve cover, setup
the engine like you were going to adjust the valves on #4, and compare the
heights of the valve stem tops (spring retainer things). Normally they are
even; if one's higher (exhaust) then that seat is creeping out of the head.
However, I'm not sure that you would necessarily see a compression drop with
a slipping valve seat, until it fails catastrophicaly...then you would see a
compression drop ;0)

You can also isolate a ring problem by squirting oil into the sparkplug hole
and then retesting compression. The oil will help bad rings, but do nothing
for a valve. You could have worn, leaky valves or seats without having a
seat that is actually coming out.

My 1979 2000 engine started misfiring and I troubleshot down to a 30#
compression on the #4 cylinder.  Now I suspect that either the piston ring
or
valve seat has failed.  I heard that type II engines are known for valve
seats
to fail.  Is this true and how will I know when I look at it?
