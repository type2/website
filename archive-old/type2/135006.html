Subject: RE: [T2] RE: Discount Tires (and Snows!) for Busses

&gt; I don't know about anyone else, but I occasionally find that 
&gt; the 'Depot online catalog is written in a confusing way, or leaves out 
&gt; information that's necessary to make a buying decision.
&gt; 
&gt; Ron, I would be glad to let you know about confusing information on 
&gt; your site -- and I'm sure that other listees would be glad as well -- 
&gt; if we thought that you would take action to make the site better.


I'd absolutely welcome any such feedback!  Please don't hesitate to p-mail
me. I can make web changes almost immedately. 

Although in this particular case, I'm not sure that most people would find
the description confusing. Stating that a tire is COMPATIBLE with stock VW
rims (a useful piece of information) is not the same as saying that it
INCLUDES those rims.
