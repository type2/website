I believe a lot of stations mix regular and super to get mid-grade fuel.

If they have two tanks, its mixed at teh pump, if they have three its
mixed when the tanker pumps the gas...

Thus, if he had turned on the mid grade pump, you still would have gotten
super... (no reg. to mix it with...)

take care,
