Subject: Electric heat... possible??

Hi all,

We REALLY want to set up electric heat in our '68 camper.
We are thinking of getting the Kymco alternator and maybe
getting a second battery? Has anyone set this up with any
success? I already know about gas heat, etc. I'm asking
about electric heat possibilities.

Thanks!

Jen :)
