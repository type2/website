Subject: Exhaust nuts

Okay, I have a couple rather basic questions about the exhaust manifolds
on my Type IV engine.

1. Do I want to use a flat washer, or a spring-type lock washer under
the nuts that mount these to the head?

2. What's the proper torque?  I really don't want to snap off one of my
brand new studs or pull it out of the head.
