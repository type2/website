Subject: VW crash testing?

I stumbled across this website
(http://members.tripod_dot_com/~mueller008/subsites/mobil01.html)
that mentions something about VW crash testing the bus when they came out 
with the T2. I'm not sure whether its true but if it is, has anyone heard 
about what VW learned from the tests. I saw the results of vanagon-volvo 
test online which was pretty interesting, but one cannot expect the 
baywindow busses to fair quite that well. What are any of the experiences 
you've had with collisions? (So far I've only been impressed with the 
powerful breaks, not the rigidity of the frame). Hopefully this list isn't 
ominously devoid of drivers who've survived a crash in a bus...
