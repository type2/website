Barry opines thusly:

&quot;...Well, I also got a pair of those amber turn signal bulbs, and now
going out on *B*y [edited to avoid The Wrath of Admin] to find a pair of
clear front marker lenses so that I can make use of all the bulbs. &quot;

Whoa...  Barry...  Kewl!  If you really are going for the height/depth
of kewlness, you shoulda been at www.brazilshopping_dot_com back in the day
when they had not only &quot;normal&quot; orange lenses, way kewl kleer lenzez,
AND &quot;dark tint&quot; lenses too - front and back (amber bulbs, of course)...
For some reason, I'm no longer able to get into the bus lighting section
anymore.  I picked up a set along with one of Zarir's way cool
Brazi-style front grill for the '73 Deluxe...  Looks pretty slick with
the cream/beige paint combo, lightly tinted windows, and gold-tone MBZ
alloys.  But you better keep your sphincters screwed on pretty tight,
'cause they don't have (Hold your breath, volks!) US DOT markings on
them (&quot;The horror... the horror...&quot;)  The front &quot;dark tint&quot; jobbies are
toadily kewl with with the amber t/s + parking bulb plus the clear side
marker bulb...  &quot;Two, two, two colors in one!&quot;

I need to eat some lunch now!
