Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for braided lines for my 70 bug gas heater

In the Type2_dot_com library it suggests cutting off the 
fittings( I used a dremel with a thin cut-off disc) and 
using fuel line and clamps.
I've done this for the last 5 yrs and it works great.
You'll need two different sizes of fuel line.  I take 
the two different fittings with me to the flaps so I can 
try them on.
I also change my fuel lines every fall in preparation 
for winter.
pmail me with any further q's.
