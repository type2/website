Hi all,

I installed the Gabriel air shocks in my Westy, today and everything
went easy, except I had to make the top shock bolts, because all the
automotive hardware, and misc.. suppliers are closed today.

Here's what the problem is.

On the way home this evening, I was traveling on an local expressway,
when I went through a wallow, in the road,a nd I heard a bump, coming
from the right rear.
The bump went to a Bang---every time I hit an irregularity in the road.


I thought one of the bolts I welded together boke, at least that's what
it sounded like.
I thought the right hand upper shock bolt snapped, and the top of the
shock was hitting the wheel well.

I got home and grabbed a flashlight, and crawled under the bus, and lo
and behold the shocks are still there, bolted firmly to their mounts.

I jumped on the bumper, and no noise.

I think that the right torsion bar snapped.

I can feel the rear end dropping when I go through a bump or wallow or
dip in the road, like the right rear is soft.

I am going to let the air out of the shocks tomorrow morning, and see if
the right side drops without the shocks loading the rear end.

Is this at all possible?

I don't even want to think what it would be like to replace a bar that
is snapped off in the tube !!
 
Anyone ever have this happen to them?

Suggestions are needed prior to sidasue.

Not Happy At All------------
