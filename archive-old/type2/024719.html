Subject: Re: Question about rocker problem
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

Bryce and I have gotten the heads and valve gear on the engine from China 
Cat, an 1800. once Ljet, now carbed, someday back to Ljet.

We have a puzzler. One of the rockers, #1 exhaust, is &quot;buried&quot; down into the 
valve spring upper washer. With the lifter on the base circle, you can see 
none of the head of the adjuster screw below the end of the rocker.

Now, we have two sets of rockers, and I suppose that we could have crossed 
one of them, but the rocker seems to have the correct geometry. It looks as 
if one of the lifters or pushrods is 10mm longer than the others.

Has anyone seen such a thing? We have to break the engine down again :-( as 
my next post will describe :-(, so I'll have a look at the lifter then, but 
would like to have the opinion of the list as to what is going on.

TIA/Don Carron
