Subject: Making a carb fit with an alternator, and bigger main jets

Hello, today I solved both issues, with 2 different carbs. I installed  new
main jets in both my Brosol H30-31 carb and my Bocar 34PICT3 carb.(both
carbs use the same thread size for the main jets)
 I put a 135 main in the 30-31 for my 1641 trike engine. I put a 140 main in
the 34PICT3 for my 1776 bus engine.

I got a used accel pump linkage from an old alternator 34PICT3 carb. I now
know how to do it. The part that goes right onto the throttle shaft is
flipped over so it's out of the way of the alt body. I'm pretty happy to get
these issues settled for now.

If you still need bigger main jets, they're $4 Canadian, available in many
sizes from John's Bug Shop      905-374-4323.

  I tried to stick a jet from the old Solex into the Brosol and it was too
big. I have not been able to find a source for replacement jets, even stock
sizes. My bus is running a little lean at highway speeds because of it and
I would like to move it up to at least a 127.5. I would drill out a stock
size if I had a spare, but I am too scared to drill out my only jet.
