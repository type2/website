Mr. JT,
 Your Heat Exchangers are where the hot exhaust gases run beside and around
air blown through from the warm-air blower. If you get under the engine of
your '72 you will see two rectangular pans, one either side of the main
engine case below the cylinder heads. They are about 8&quot; by 17&quot; (approx) and
are attached to the muffler at the rear, the four exhaust manifolds above
(two on each heat exchanger), and should send warm-air forwards via a
flexible tube to the heater control boxes. They are the heater boxes, also
known as heat exchangers, and if you have the muffler attached to your bus
I would assume you have them both. Get the Haynes manual for the '72-'79
Transporter - I've been doing this DIY VW lark for about a year now and
I've found that book invaluable in helping me to identify parts all over
the bus.
