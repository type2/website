Subject: Re: &quot;Hammering&quot; sound in 81

I think Aaron has put the hammer on the head! I experienced a noise like you describe coming 
and going until I finally correlated the frequency of the rapping to that of the wheel/axle 
rotation. I localized it down to one side and removed that half shaft. I cleaned up both joints 
and then replaced the CV joint that appeared to be more worn (more play, more binding when 
rotating). This did the trick. 

Suggestion: Carefully inspect the rubber boots over the joints for cracks or rips. If you've 
got one open this may be the culprit!

Sounds like it could be a dodgey CV joint(s).
