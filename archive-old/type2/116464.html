Subject: RE: [T2] germany info?

  There is a great VW shop in Frankfurt, I don't remember the name but he
has a lot of cool parts. I am sure if you ask around someone will tell you
where the vintage VW parts shop is at. If you find it see if he has any NOS
steering column locks or cab divider glass and seals left.
   Another hint is to take a list of part numbers and go to the dealers
parts department ( there is a dealer on about every street corner) you will
be amazed at how many NOS parts the dealers still have. clue is don't go in
as an arrogant American, befriend the parts guy and they will be very
helpful.

ronnie

ps. He has/had sets of NOS bay window jail bars

Folks,

I have a rare opportunity to be in Germany next week on business.

I will be mostly in the southern part of Germany and around 
Frankfurt and Freiburg and am wondering if any one knows 
of any interesting vw locations in that area that I might be able to visit.

Secret parts stores, swap meets and vw flea markets could be interesting!

pmail if necessary.

Thanks ,dave
