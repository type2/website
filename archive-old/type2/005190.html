Hello all!

I have a couple questions, but first a bit of background.  I am relatively
new to the list, though I have posted a couple questions in the past.
Thanks to all who have offered their valuable advice!  I have 76 west that I
am slowly getting to the way I want it.  The way I want it is still far off
in the distance.  Today I found a 76 Westy the is exactly like mine, but in
&quot;like new&quot; condition.  The owner is asking $4500.  The bus in question has a
rebuilt 2000cc engine with about 100 miles on it, straight body with new
paint, great interior, and the pop-top canvas has no holes.  Bottom
line...she's beautiful.

My bus (Gretchen), though I love her, has problems.  Among others, I have
been told by more than one mechanic that the engine is about to go, there is
body rust (including a completely rusted out battery tray), dents, torn
canvas, etc.

The questions....What way should I go?  Should I go for the new Westy?
Well, specifically, how much am I looking at for a new or rebuilt engine?  I
see adds in the mags for engines in the area of $1500-2000, but is that all
I need?  Are there other parts that need to be bought that are not
mentioned?  Am I making any sense here?  I also am battling my problem with
instant gratification.....I want it now!!  Also, what is the going rate for
a 76 Westy in pristine condition?  Is $4,500 too much?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  I am also will to phone someone if
it would be easier to explain verbally, rather than in e-mail.  Just send
your # in p-mail.  Thanks, again, all of you....

Dizzy with desire....
Rob
