the

 Do you mean this as a &quot;rule,&quot; so to speak?  I don't think that these
statements are strictly true in general.

 I bought my '63 Beetle from the original owner.  The oil drain plug had
fallen out in the early '70s; the oil followed &amp; the engine was toasted.
The 40horse 1200 was rebuilt at that time with a new replacement case.
The new replacement case has only a &quot;D&quot; stamped in it; there was no number
&quot;ground off.&quot;  According to Muir, it looks like the only Beetle engines
that came from the factory with serial numbers beginning with &quot;D&quot; were
34hp 1200s.  My crankcase is of the correct style for my '63, but its only
identifier--&quot;D&quot;--doesn't appear to be related to any serial number series
of engines of that style.  FWIW :)

i believe all the engines sold with the cars had serial numbers stamped on
them.   send it back to vw for a rebuild and they take the number off,
leaving the letter code identifying the case type.   local shops dont bother
the number.   i never bought a new case, havent seen many, they may not have
numbers, i dont know.

a D case is a 70s 40 hp case, with larger oil passages and the dual pressure
relief.     the 'best' case if you like 40hp motors.
