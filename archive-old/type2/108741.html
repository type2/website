Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Pedal is stiff?

&gt; I mean I litearly have to put all my force to get it to work. They do work,
 just have to press real hard on the brake pedal to get them to work. Any
 ideas would be appreciated.

A little more info would help a LOT!

Being on the type2 list means you have a bay bus from 68 to 79 or an aircooled Vanagon from 80 to 83. Knowing
the year is essential to knowing if you have power brakes or not. 68 to 70 does not have a booster.
