Subject: Oil bottle spout

I figured since the list is kinda slow tonight this would be ok. I found
a red plastic nozzle at WMart tonight that snaps onto
a oil bottle real easy. It makes pouring oil a breeze. It also came with
a couple other nozzles to use on other size containers.
It cost two bucks .

Required bus content: I was able to pour oil in my bus with no funnel
without spilling it : )
