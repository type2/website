Subject: Why would a valve guide be leaving small bits in the valve
  cover?

I've never come across this before. My daughters 1600 SP engine started
making a louder clatter than usual over a few months period, so I thought I
d adjust the valves. They turned out to be set correctly, but I noticed
under one valve, that fine bits of brass was collecting in the valve cover.
Enough for my eye to pick up the fine particles. I assume the clatter is
from a worn valve guide. Why would only one have this, and has anyone else
ever seen this happen? Time to replace the valve guide I guess.



Regards,

Courtney
