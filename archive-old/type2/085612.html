Subject: gas range

anyone have the supplement for the gas range for a 77 westy, also i would
like to get ahold of the table for the westy or the dimensions of it and
some good pics to possibly have a replacement fabricated.  also the table
that goes between front seats is that available for the 77 westy as well.
thanx all, also point me the right way if ive transgressed my bounds.

ciao,
Brett
