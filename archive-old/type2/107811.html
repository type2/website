Subject: Correct cam gear backlash (mechanics only)

I'm &quot;restoring&quot; the engine in my 1970 bus which I bought new in Nov 69:
New SP heads &amp; case (Brazilian), original std std crank, I need a new cam. I
am concerned about the backlash on the cam gear which come in different
sizes (+1, 0. -1, etc). An engine guy told me he fitted 19 cams once to get
the correct backlash.
I don't have access to 19 cams so I wonder if anyone has advice on this?
Someone suggested I take the left half of the case w/crank to the local
FLAPS that has an engine rebuilding guy and let him fit a reground cam for
proper backlash.
