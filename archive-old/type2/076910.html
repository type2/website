&lt;&lt; On another note- Someone told me that VW gave college money to a kid that

was born in the back of a Vanagon. Anyone know of any truth to that story? &gt;&gt;

Yes, but unfortunately, he was later killed in Arizona when he strapped a JATO
bottle to the top of that selfsame Vanagon and outran the brakes, hurling the
Vanagon into a mountain cliff.
