Subject: Re: [T2] Re: &amp;*^&amp;!!!! oil filter interchange!

Just curiouse but,
I've been running bigger than stock oil filters on type 4's for a few years 
now.  I don't see any reason not too.  The way the filter is mounted 
vertically on the engine, it's not about to drain back into the sump and 
cause any over filling issues.  One perk, since I don't live close to any 
autoparts store, let alone one that caters to imports, is that  the bigger 
filter that fits in there is the super generic L30001(purolator) or the fram 
PH8A if you like the walmart house brand :)   They always have a dozen in 
stock, and I just find it much easier to access and get it off than the 
small stock filter, and it doesnt't hang down below the bottom of the 
engine, sits about flush, and of course it seams to be cheaper than the 
smaller filter and my local flaps.  So am I right or wrong?  Is bigger 
better or not?  Not trying to start a debate, just curious to know if anyone 
has any experiences with this.  Thanks
Mike
