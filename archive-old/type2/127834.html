Subject: Make my own charcoal canister?

Hello, list. I was thinking about the possibility of making my own charcoal canister. What, exactly is the makeup of a charcoal canister? What if I took a can of tomato paste, drilled a hole in the top and drained the paste, cleaned it out, funneled some charcoal, like what you'd get in an aquarium store, drilled a hole in the bottom and ran the vent line to it and out the other side? Is there something more complicated to a stock charcoal canister? I couldn't mount it in the normal location, of course, but could easily place it on the vacant driver's side battery tray. (My stock system is no more). Thoughts?                                                    -Paul Deatherage
