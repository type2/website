Subject: Re: [T2] Engine conversion 

&gt;He told me that in Kenya they all pour oil in
gasoline to make the engine last longer. 

Don't tell the EPA.  On a similar note, a few
months ago I spoke with an old Dubber (he was
mostly a KG guy), who advised putting a half
gallon of diesel in every tank for aircooled
VW's.  He said it would up the octane to higher
than current &quot;premium&quot; gas for little more the
cost of a regular gas, and that the parafin and
sulphur were good top end lubes.  I forgot about
his weird suggestion until you mentioned the oil
in the gas.  Any thoughts?   

Happy bussin'
