Subject: clutch or tranny?

so its hard to get into gear on our bus and in first and second it has
slipped out of gear a few times.  we reaplaced our clutch disc a bit ago but
havnt replaced our needle bearing as someone on the list sugested, yet. 
could it just be the needle bearing or do we have to start looking for a new
tranny?..........................nonny
