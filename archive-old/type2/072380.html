&gt;2. The engine seal is so-so how critical is it?

Hey Ken.
The seal is the most important part of the bus, without it or having 
a bad one results in an overheated engine because the air doesnt get 
trapped in there correctly. If the seal is bad, I would suggest 
replacing it as soon as you can. I just got a new bus not too long 
ago and not very knowledgeable about them yet but I was just having 
this same conversation with another bus owner today and he mention to 
we how good my seal was. He then told me about a woman who recently 
purchased a bug, she got down the street after picking it up form the 
person who owned it to find herself on the side of the road. He 
stopped (mostly because it was a bus in need of help) opened the 
engine and found that the former owner rigged the seal together in 
the bus but installed a rebuilt engine. We'll it looked like the 
engine had burned out because of the seal. I too never knew the value 
in having a good proper seal before today.
