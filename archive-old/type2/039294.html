Subject: Paint Shop in New England

Hi Volks,

I am getting perilously close to leaving for Italy. I am bringing my bus.

I need to find a GOOD Paint and Body shop in New England.
I live in New Hampshire, but will travel to the right shop.

Can anyone recommend a good Paint and Body shop.
My bus is original paint, and only needs the windshield metal repaired.
Then the whole bus needs to be shot. It is only one color.

I will be bringing the bus on a tow dolly, with the interior stripped out of
it. 

I have all new seals, window kits etc.

Please reply with your recommendations.
Is there a list of Body and Paint shops on the website?

This bus can be seen at:

HTTP://people.ne.mediaone_dot_net/matthewd/Bug/68camper.html

Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.
I am looking for as close to show quality as possible. Not Concours.

Thanks,
Matt
