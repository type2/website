&gt;
&gt; Hello All:
&gt;
&gt; This is an odd one.  First, some background.  Last summer I built a new eng=
&gt; ine for my 71 bus, and it's been running well for about 5K miles.  In the l=
&gt; ast few months, it's been losing a little oil, which I attributed to leakin=
&gt; g push rod tube seals.  I had to add a quart of oil about every 250-300 mil=
&gt; es.  In the last couple weeks, I noticed my oil pressure was dropping to ab=
&gt; out 20-30 PSI on the freeway, where it was about 50 PSI normally.  The funn=
&gt; y thing was, my oil level was OK.  Last night, on the freeway, my oil press=
&gt; ure was only about 20 PSI.  Suddenly, the tone of my engine changed, gettin=
&gt; g quieter, and there was a corresponding loss of power.  My first thought w=
&gt; as that a spark plug wire came loose, and I was running on less than 4 cyli=
&gt; nders.  When I got home, I looked at the wires, and they were all attached.=
&gt;   With the engine running, I pulled each spark plug wire, one at a time, to=
&gt;  see if that would make a difference.  It turns out that wires 1 and 3 made=
&gt;  no difference in the running of the engine, but 2 and 4 each made the engi=
&gt; ne sputter and run rough.  This would indicate that 1 and 3 are not firing,=
&gt;  but there's a spark going to all 4 cylinders.  A little more back ground: =
&gt;  I used 88mm slip-in P &amp; C's, which I found out later are highly not recomm=
&gt; ended, since the cylinder walls are so thin that they'll eventually warp.  =
&gt; Could this be what has happened in this instance???

Have you retorqued the heads since the engine was built?  Or, maybe studs are pulling out.
