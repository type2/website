Subject: Re: [T2] Fan Shroud Flaps and the HE Covers

&gt; How important are either the flaps or the covers?

The the air pressure is the highest at that point, you will lose a lot of
air that would normally go for heating if you don't have the covers.

The flaps keep the booster fan from  pushing it's air into the main fan.

&gt; Does anybody have any extras laying around?

No but keep in mind there is a right and a left so you'll need to ask for
the right one.

&gt; How hard would it be to install them after the fact?

Mostly no problem if your exhaust lines up ok.
