Mike and the List,

What type of exhaust are you running?  The stock exhaust is very restrictive. 
 Changing to an extractor system will allow your engine to pull higher revs.  
Be careful what you wish for though, low end torque may suffer.  I have a 
1600 in my '69 Kombi with dual Kadrons, Weber 110 cam and extractor exhaust.  
I experimented with various combinations of stock exhaust, stock carb, 
extractor exhaust and dual Kadrons.  The stock carb will let the engine rev 
as long as the extractor is used with it.  Even the Kadrons won't pull high 
revs with a stock exhaust.  I think you get the most &quot;bang for your buck&quot; 
with an extractor exhaust.
