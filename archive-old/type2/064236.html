&gt;And what is
&gt;an engine?  A machine, with tolerance requirements that run the
&gt;gamut, from loose (engine tin to cylinder head clearance) to moderately
&gt;tight (valve clearance, bearing clearance).  Tenths don't really
&gt;seem necessary, since the engine was designed to wear, and tolerances
&gt;for engine bearings, valve lengths, brake drums, etc are given in
&gt;a range of thousandths (see Bently).

After I blathered that I thought ten thousandths were overkill for engine
building, somebody sent me a note and said that when he had rebuilt a
Corvair engine recently he had measured the valve stems for spec. Said the
spec required a tolerance of a few ten thousandths.

That gave me pause--here somebody is writing specs for an internal
combustion engine in ten thousandths of an inch, and (this is damned
amazing) that somebody is General Motors Corporation. Curioser and
curioser!
