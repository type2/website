Subject: Pertronix source in WA

Hi,  I can't find a pertronix in Vancouver BC these days as all FLAPS are
out of stock here. I am going to Seattle this weekend and would like to pick
one up there. Can a listee between Bellingham and Seattle advise of who
might have them?Preferably at a competitive price.  Bob
