Subject: Windshield Specs

I am trying to put the Windshield back into my 1972 Bus after fixing the
rust for the 3rd time.  This has always been a very difficult procedure.
Much harder than any of my Beetles.  I am beginning to think that the
factory may have make the frame smallish or the Windshield Glass may be a
little large.  Does anyone know where I can find the dimensions of the frame
and the dimensions of the Glass?
