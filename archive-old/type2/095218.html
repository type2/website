Subject: 1968 Bus Passenger side Windshield Wiper Arm 


&gt;&gt;How does one tell if it's a 1968 arm?

I'm also interested: how does one tell if it is a passenger side wiper arm??

I pulled two silver colored wiper arms off a real old Mercedes 280 - That is 
when I found out that there really is a passenger side and a drive side 
wiper arm !!

Now I'm looking for another MB driver side wiper arm....
