Subject: the VW problem

 
Before we got our busses, we bought a jetta, thinking that until we found the aircooled vehicles we wanted, we could at least drive a VW.

That was before I learned much about the current state of affairs at the company.

I'll be letting VW know that once I unload their jetta, I won't be purchasing another new one.

My main point is that list griping feels good, but doesn't get our voices heard.

How about a formal letter/petition we could all sign (multiple vw lists) and forward on expressing our thoughts about all these issues that cause us to hate the current vw ag?
