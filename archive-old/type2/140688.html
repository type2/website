Subject: Heated front windshield??

There is a want ad on the Samba from a person in the UK looking for a 'heated front windshield' for their 79
bus.
http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds/detail.php?id=230540

OK, I am buffaloed...... I have never seen or heard of one being available. As far as I know, only tempered
for non-US buses or laminated for US buses are available.
211 845 101 J [toughened] non-USA
211 845 101 K [laminated] USA

I don't know of any car offering a heated windshield, like a heated back window.

So then I thought, well VW offered the Vanagon in 79 in Europe, maybe this is what this person has. No, they
did not have a 'heated windshield' either.....  Only clear glass or green glass in laminated style only.
251 845 101 A or 251 845 101.
