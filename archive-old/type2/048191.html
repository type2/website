Subject: Re: [T2] Air conditioning

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;People have been travelling thoughout the southwest and Mexico for
&gt;centuries without A/C.  VWs were made specifically without air
&gt;conditioning and therefore are excellent vehicles for this trip.  &quot;modern&quot;
&gt;vehicles are designed with A/C required to keep normal temps in their
&gt;poorly-vented passenger compartments.  Buses have lots of vents to keep
&gt;the air flowing!
&gt;
&gt;For the kids, a couple of spray bottles and a cooler full of beverages
&gt;will make all the difference.

I am considering getting one of those portable fine mist sprayers, I 
have seen small ones designed to be carried with should strap. You 
fill them with water, pump in some air and then use push button valve 
to spray yourself with a very fine mist. They are quite cooling and 
should be easy enough for the driver to work safely.

I note that our type 2's have a steeper angle on the windshield. 
While this may not be very aerodynamic efficient, it seems to let in 
less sunlight that heats the interior.
