Subject: Service Material for radio? LMU?

Hello,

I was curious if there was service material available for the radio that is in my bus. It's silver with black knobs, and has buttons for L,M, and U ... U (FM) works fine, L &amp; M are dead quiet. I would like to fix the radio if it can be.

Thanks.
