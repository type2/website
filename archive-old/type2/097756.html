Subject: Re: [T2] thermastat inst./replacement

The cable goes from the thermostat toward the rear of the engine to a pulley 
wheel (the best I can describe) and up to the lever for the flaps.

Hope this helps.

&gt; I am about to replace my rotted therm. none of my &quot; HOW TO &quot; books show this 
&gt; 
&gt; and unfortunately the cable is rotted away as well. Where does the cable go 
&gt; 
&gt; to from the therm. If anyone has gone through this before I would love a 
&gt; walk 
&gt; through. Pictures would be a plus or you can just come over and do it for 
&gt; me!!!  HA HA HA
