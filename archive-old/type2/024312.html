Subject: Re: '78 FI Hoses &amp;  Replacements
Message-ID: &lt;7k75ug$qest_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

The braided cloth covered hoses are standard &quot;by the yard&quot; items in metric
&gt;from Germany. The rubber 90 connectors will have a number on them. Measure
the inside and outside diameter of the hoses. The FI smooth hoses are also
Standard metric German manufacture. The breather hose is very special material
and size. I can get you good pricing on everything but the breather hose, dealer only, if you will provide the measures and numbers.

The hoses are not cheap, but they do last 15 to 20 years, if you use the good
clamps and don't overtighted them.

No need to get hosed on hoses.

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm about to finally replace the transmission in my '78, so must pull
&gt; the engine. As I look at the maze of hoses in that compartment, I know
&gt; that I will inevitably have to both take some 'before' photos so I know
&gt; how all this goes back and also do some labeling. This is my first trip
&gt; into 2L FI engine. 
&gt; 
&gt; First, are there any web sites with information and photos? Second, can
&gt; I still get replacement hoses for most or all of these ? This bus purred
&gt; and had about 140# compression all around when it rolled in here almost
&gt; two years ago, but most of the hoses look like they should be replaced
&gt; as part of this adventure. Someone could probably make some money with a
&gt; good kit and some instructions..
&gt; 
&gt; Bentley is little help, the archives have more questions than answers
&gt; and I see that the Robert Bosch FI manual is out of print. Anybody have
&gt; one they would like to sell ? 
&gt; 
&gt; I'm now considering this bus as my daily driver to replace my '71 until
&gt; I finish bodywork on her. The idea of having a heater with blower is
&gt; also real nice for the PNW winters.
