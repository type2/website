Subject: Re: Rocker panel removal...

No joy, David.  When I replaced mine, I found and old &quot;body and paint&quot; man with a little
shop who was willing to lend me room, his tools, and expertise for not much, if I did the
grunt work.  I bought the preformed panel, and getting the old one out was a bear.  Needed
pneumatic metal cutter and grinder, plus had to braise and spot-weld the new panel in.
The good news is that I did it about five years ago, used a couple of coats of anti-rust
catylitic primer and good paint, and it is holding up just fine.
