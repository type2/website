AIRS ALERT!

Geoff Rousseau is broken down in Banff, Alberta with what seems like  
a major engine issue. He is driving a '74 Westy and the engine will  
not turn over by hand.

He is staying with friends in Banff and headed for Vancouver. He may  
tow the bus to Tony's in Calgary, but perhaps someone closer can help.

His cell number is 604-209-1489. he can also be reached by email at  
g.c.rousseau_at_gmail_dot_com.
