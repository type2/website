Howdy Folks,

        My wife and our two boys are away this weekend.  I've got the
driveway cleaned and swept, my overalls on, and two buses back to back.
I'll be swapping the engines tonight and tomorrow (and probably Sunday as
well).   

Figured I'd throw a hello out to everyone, and also see if any Portland, OR
area listees wanted to stop by and watch and say hello.  

Wanna bussers: I've got a 1972 white camper for sale.  It may or may not
have an engine in it, but I have a working engine in the basement I (or you)
could install if I get the time this weekend.  

Figured it would be fun to meet a few more of you.  It's late notice, but if
you are interested drop me a line.  

take care,
        brandy
