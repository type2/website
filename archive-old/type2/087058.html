&gt; this, I am only trying to get helpful advice.

put a nice 2liter fuel injected engine in it.  probably need to put the
later tranny in too but you at least have a VW engine that is made for
this kind of driving.   personally years ago I raced (formula III group
III) and I don't find the bus handles well enough over 70 for my taste and
having slid a 60 into a 360 and had a slight tap by a truck spin my 78
around I can tell you lack of traction is not a nice thing,  and I run
some pretty hefty tires on mine...wanna race (I know you've heard this
before but I have to share the road with you) get a nice Porsche 911SC or
more in keeping with a VW feel a nice &quot;bathtup&quot; 1600SC Carrera....now that
brings back some memories, but I degress)
