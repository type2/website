Hi all,

Just a reminder to all the 'Brits' on the list that this coming weekend sees 
the annual British Volkswagen Festival held a Malvern just south of 
Birmingham so fairly central for most.

For a map point your browser at www.soft_dot_net_dot_uk/vwt2oc/events.htm.

The Volkswagen Type 2 Owners Club will be there helping to keep your legend 
alive. 

Lots of new and secondhand parts dealers, club stands, static exhibitions, 
evening entertainment, vehicle sales, cruise around the Malvern Hills. 
THOUSANDS of air cooled VWs. (and a few wet ones too)

This show draws VW lovers from all over UK and from continental Europe; we 
even had a spittie driven from Pensylvania USA one year.

Cost is ABOUT £7 per night camping plus £7 per adult entrance.
