Subject: Propane heaters: they ALL need to be vented.

I know we've hashed through this last year and we'll probably hash 
through it again this year, but....

The Bus is a small, confined area. Even if you find a combustion device 
that is 100% efficient (producing only CO2 and H2O), you're oxygen levels 
in a closed BUS will decrease and your supposedly 100% efficient heater 
will start producing CO because it does not have enough oxygen. 

Heaters with separate combustion airways alleviate most of the worry 
about the above scenario (but are necessarily less efficient...)

FTR, I've slept in my (closed) Bus (at different times) with a portable
infrared heater (2000 BTU)--I lived, a vented open flame heater (5000 
BTU-that
burns inside air), and an AC ceramic heater (which of course is the safest
and easiest). I've just recently chucked them all in favor of a 12000 BTU
Suburban furnace.

 The Propex heaters you guys are talking about sound great considering
their extremely small size: but, alas, I have already shoe-horned my
Suburban into place....(the electricity demand of the Propex seems
excessive, however...)

And, of course, please, if you have any desire to live, buy a CO detector!
