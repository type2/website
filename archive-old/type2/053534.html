Subject: bus key problem--please read

hi, I got my bus(71 westy) around christmas time and the PO
gave me the most worn out key i have seen in a while.  I was wondering
why he didnt get a new one until today when i took my key and car to the
locksmith and he said my existing key cannot be copied and that a new
key cannot be made from my door lock.  I then tried to go to the dealer
to find a key code but they dont have it. The locksmith told me that
there is  nothing i can do except change the 5 locks operated by
my old key.  My brother has an 86 scirocco and he modified his door lock
to accomodate a different key.  He filed down the brass tumblers that
prevent/allow the key to turn and that worked.  my questions---do the
door locks on the busses
disassemble enogh to expose the tumblers? does anyone know another
solution to my problem? does anyone have a parts bus with all good
handles/locks/keys.
Thank you for reading--Brian--71 westy
