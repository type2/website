Subject: Re: [T2] Power brake booster

&quot;Gregory Thompson&quot; &lt;gretnagreg_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt; said;

In my experience, a disk brake bus with a NON functioning servo is MUCH more 
difficult to stop than a disk brake bus that never had a servo.  There must 
be something in the servo itself that adds to this difficulty.  My SC stops 
just fine with only slightly more effort than my 79 campe (with working 
power brakes).  greg

Perhaps the difference is in master cylinders. Is it possible that MC's meant for power brake systems have larger or smaller bores to take advantage of the greater braking force provided by the booster?

Just a thought
