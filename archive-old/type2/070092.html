Subject: Motor Swap Inquiry

My neighbor asked what would be involved in putting a 1600 DP from a 
75 beetle onto a 73 camper which has a 1700 cc pancake with the dual 
carbs. I guess the real question is the compatibility with the 
transmission, but if anyone has info please email me 
direct.

(side note: he would like to dump the dual weber carbs for a 
single carb intake, send me your telephone number if you are 
interested in purchasing the carbs and manifold).

Question #2: Could anyone send me how to contact Mark Stephens. I 
would like to price his 1600 DP Long Block and my neighbor will need a 
price on a 1700 CC pancake longblock. 

Thanks ahead!
