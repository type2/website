&lt;&lt; So true, I'm across the river from the 71(?) Fort Myers FL bus, but no

garage and short of $$$. I don't want to be one in a long line of  probable

previous owners that never got to enjoy it. ( In this case I take it her/his

moving to NC and having the bus apart it just wasn't worth grief of

transporting it up there.)


You gotta wonder how many previous (st)owners have been bankrupted and

defeated by buses their now selling for $200-500 firm...


Anyone else have an assembled running camper bus of some sort in reasonable

condition in SW Florida for a fair price? Seems like the affordable / usable

/ maintainable ones are always CA / OR /  WA etc.!


Down here it's either brand new looking and $$$$$$ or $$$ and in pieces... &gt;&gt;

Every chronologically challenged car list I'm on recommends buying the best
condition vehicle you can afford...Busses are no different, and a bit harder
to stash when they go down and need repairs...You've got to be realistic a-
bout it...If it's gonna be your only transportation, do you have enough cash,
tools, and know-how to keep it up and running? A Bus that won't start and
resists your diagnostic efforts is no fun, and worse if it's in a parking 
space
that it can't stay in...
