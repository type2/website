Subject: RE: Cheap Busses

If I could get a relatively rust free bus for $500 or so, I would jump on 
it, but in my 15 years of buying and selling cars and VW's (definitely a 
superior breed...) I will always spend a little more for a better bus to 
start with.

With VW's getting close to 20-30 years old, most of the examples I see 
around here are suffering not only from negliect leading to less than 
acceptable cosmetics, but most are suffering from rust waiting to scare you 
the first time you start sanding on the lower body for that next paint job.

Our friend mentioned he was faced with a $2500 bill to have windshield rust 
repaired. That says he either hasn't got the tools, the time, or the 
knowledge to repair the bus himself. It also hints that he did not see the 
evidence when he got the bus in the first place. For him, he needs a good 
start, not somebody's lost cause.

Yes you can buy a $100 bus and get it running but for you looks and the 
details may not be important. Others like me want to know that the 
fenderwells are clean and rust free. I want to get a bus with most of the 
obscure trim and options present. I too have seen some pretty good cheap 
busses but to 'restore' them (not just get them going), would be a long 
ardus process.

IMHO buy the best bus you can afford. The best bus may not be the most 
expensive bus you can afford - be sure the seller doesn't hold this bus in 
a higher opinion than it is worth. If the bus is worth $3K then offer him 
that. If he passes, make sure you check back later. His price may scare 
everyone else away too leaving you with a good chance to buy this bus for 
you price.

I see alot of solid busses in the $2.5K-$3K price range. Motor repairs are 
easy enough for the average home mechanic but major rust repair probably 
isn't. Same goes for collsion repairs or paint jobs. Many of us live in 
restricted neighborhoods or apartments (like me) when mechanical work is 
acceptable but your metal work options are limited to farming it out.

Hang in there. You will find what you want. Yes you can easily spend more 
than what the bus is worth but if you plan to keep it, it's transportation 
value and appreciation in price may out way what you spend today (of course 
a 10K bus might be hard to sell this year and next year and 5 years from 
now....) AT least you'll know what the has been done to the bus and what 
needs to be done - not what a seller promises you (like he cares once he 
gets your money).

Also take promises of new engines or trannies carefully. Even if he has 
reciepts, the engine may lack the warm up equipment (thermostats), may 
still need tuning, or rotted rubber gas lines repaired. The engine may 
still be worn out - what you consider to be a new engine (all new 
everything, carefully assembled) may not be the same thing to him (new 
piston rings and a few new gaskets, or new bearings and an un-turned 
crankshaft). The same applies to rust repairs.

Take care all. (Just my $.02).
