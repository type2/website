Subject: Removing the rear valance on a late loaf bus

I was looking at that picture of the guy who made
his rear valance removable.  Seems like a good
idea if it could be done without it looking like
a hack job..... but I noticed that the type 4
engine (with tin) is slightly wider than the rear
valance (even if one were to cut it as wide as
possible).  Don't think it would be very useful
to us 'mericuns.  

For those who didn't notice, that was a euro spec
late bus with a 1600 engine.  Even some euro
vanagons had the 1600.

Peace and blessings, 
Nemo, the Bus Captain
