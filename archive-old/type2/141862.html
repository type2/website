Subject: Re: [T2] Must-Have Item - Cup Holder/Storage Unit for Bus

Just ordered one for myself.  Sounds like a good reason to quit smoking to
me. :)


&gt; Why not
&gt; make the bottom solid instead, so in addition to a cell phone it could be
&gt; used to hold spare change, pen, turnpike ticket, etc.?

&gt;I think that's awesome!

&gt;Too bad I smoke and actually *use* my ashtray. :-(
