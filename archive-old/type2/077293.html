Subject: RE: [T2] Jake Raby motor reviews ?

See my earlier comments about bringing my bus home last week with new Type 
IV. This one may be a little different than most in that it's running a pair 
of dual Dell 40s, plus a few other goodies. I've only put a total of 150 on 
the engine so far, so I can't speak of it's longevity (yet), but I do plan 
on letting people know how it progresses as time goes by.

Just the work he did on the heads alone makes me feel much better about 
driving this thing anywhere.

I will be keeping a weekly log of how the bus progresses (yes, I have 
issues). If at any time you'd like to see how it's doing, please feel free 
to drop me a pmail.

&gt;I guess I can jump in here, too. I count myself lucky
&gt;to have been around when Jake started some of the
&gt;experiments with the big T4's, so I've gotten to see
&gt;how this has developed.
&gt;
&gt;First, his T4 motors are put together with the same
&gt;sort of philosophy as the T1's, and the results are
&gt;amazing. I got to drive the Bluebonic Plague when it
&gt;had the 2316cc Type 4 in it, and I don't know that I
&gt;can find words to describe it. Neck-snapping torque,
&gt;acceleration like what I get on my motorcycles, and a
&gt;top end that I'd be frightened to reach. Even with the
&gt;additional work Jake's done on strengthening the car,
&gt;the power in that motor is slowly ripping that Beetle
&gt;to bits - tearing out the seat tracks, and actually
&gt;starting to split the pillars. The work Jake did just
&gt;to keep clutches in that car was impressive on its
&gt;own.
&gt;
&gt;Beginning sometime early next year (Yes, Jake, I'm
&gt;finally going to do it after talking about it for so
&gt;long), I'm going to have Jake build a big T4 for my
&gt;Ghia. Originally I was thinking 2316cc, but he's
&gt;always making innovations, and I'm going to let him
&gt;make suggestions to me. People who know me understand
&gt;that's not normally how I like to do things.
&gt;
&gt;Any engine, anytime, anywhere.
&gt;

&gt; &gt; Anybody have any reviews on the Massive Type IV

&gt; &gt; I've also driven a number of the different T4
&gt; &gt; applications, and am going to have Jake build a
&gt; &gt; Massive Type IV for me next year, but since this
&gt; &gt; e-mail specifically talks about Type 1's, let me
&gt; &gt; talk
&gt; &gt; to those particular engines:
