Subject: Re: [T2] 78 Westy 2.0L engine weak fire

I wouldn't sweat the old Bentley, apparently my brain is even older. I
took a peek in the bentley before driving home tonight, while waiting
on the bus to warm up. I could find nothing about what the resistance
should be at running temp. I am almost sure I have heard this
somewhere but can't verify it. If I can remember, I'll try &amp; see what
my sensor reads when at temp. Hopefully someone can step up &amp; either
confirm or deny my memory :)

&gt;         The temp sensor II per Bently says at 68F it should read about
&gt; 2500 ohms, if considerably higher or lower then replace. Before the
&gt; weather turned cold it read 2486 ohms. If you find the warm reading to be
&gt; 0 please let me know. My Bently is old.
