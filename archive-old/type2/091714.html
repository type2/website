Subject: Re: [T2] Camshaft question

[...]
I went out and checked several cams out in the shed.  even with 
different part numbers the only differences i could see was deep dish or 
flat.  When i was building engines all i ever looked at was deep dish or 
flat for which oil pump to use.

&gt; I see now that one is dished and one is flat.
&gt; I guess RMMW's description confused me. It says the flat gear camshaft 
&gt; is
&gt; for Buses 60-71 but wouldn't a 71 with a DP 1600 use the dished gear 
&gt; due to
&gt; the larger oil pump?
