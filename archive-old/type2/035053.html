Subject: Re: Major engine problems (chatty and no tech advice!)

I feel your pain. I remember having been in a similar situation 4-5 years
back: a miserable student's budget and no access to capital markets (i.e.,
loans), little time to learn and diagnose, not to mention fix anything, and
an engine that started turning into a big headache. At the same time, I
really needed transportation and the comforting thought of being able to
travel and escape (as soon as time would permit).

If it hadn't been for this list, I think I would have ditched the bus. Of
course, the amazing technical expertise found here was a big help. Yet
without a doubt the main reason I kept the bus was that I didn't want to
leave this great bus family. &lt;wiping a tear from my eye ;)&gt;

Plus I can be very stubborn. :)

Eventually, things got better, we were able to afford another, newer, car
for transportation and reduced the bus's status to that of a hobby. I think
that decision made sense, even economic sense! The 5-year old Honda Accord
turned out to be a wonderful, completely trouble-free, appliance. Trips were
actually *relaxing* (!), not having to constantly listen to weird engine
sounds, assume that highway smells *must* come from my engine, and generally
being an automotive hypochondriac. In the bus, the combination of
desperation and insufficient technical skills had succeeded in turning me,
Mr. &quot;Rational Thought&quot;, into a superstitious idiot (such as: do not listen
to the radio or else the lurching demon will be back!).

Anyway, my advice to you is to get yourself one of them US-Japanese marvels
such as a used Honda or Toyota, then invest your time and money on *your*
terms, not the bus's, to learn more about your bus and how to fix it up. OR
sell it IF your heart can afford it... :-(

I do NOT recommend engine swaps unless your bus has made the full transition
to pure hobby, i.e., a non-essential LUXURY item. Swaps are *not* practical
(although they can be fun).

Your first rebuild was apparently not very successful. Give it another shot;
with time on your side, you probably will get it right this time AND feel
good about it. If you still have your FI parts, see if you can retrofit
them. Otherwise, check the type2 archives on how to get a Weber progressive
to work right (I vaguely remember reading something about that.)

What's up today? I'm not usually this chatty :-\

Sami ;)
