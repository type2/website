Use a wire brush and clean them and you will find the manufactures logo. 
Know that since the calipers are certainly contaminated, so is the rest of

&gt;When I called the FLAPS they asked if I had ATE or Girling calipers, but
&gt;couldn't tell me how to tell the difference. So, can anyone advise me as to
&gt;how I can tell which system I have?
