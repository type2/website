Dear Mike.

I wanted to thank you for your time with your note. IN FACT, I want to thank ALL who have replied to my question. I know...TIME..is valuable and you are all great for your notes and advice...I also liked the one with the images!

Your all the best, Thanks. When I get going on all this I will be sure to let you all know how it goes.

Peace
Andrew
