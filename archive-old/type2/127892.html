Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Depot Front Door Seals

I just looked at my door seal (while picking it up from the tire place)
and it looks like yours. It's held out the elements since I installed
it. Sorry for the curveball, I must have been recalling the corner in
the lower corner of the door, not the upper. Odd that they'd contour
one, but not the other.
