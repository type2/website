Subject: Re: [T2] Mix in gas tank

I think your friend is &quot;special&quot;. Putting oil in the gas would do NOTHING
for the engine, the gas is isolated in the area between the cylinders and
the heads, the only place it would come in contact with anything to lube it
would be the intake port guides. The oil would also effectively lower the
octane of the gas, and also lead to nice carbon buildup in the heads and
piston tops. This is a no win situation. I can't think of anything postive
to come of it except minimal lubing of the intake guide.

&gt; You know... One time somebody told me to put in a little bit of motor
&gt; oil with each tank of gas, like a tenth of a quart of oil to a full tank

&gt; know that it's good for the engine. It'll help keep it lubricated
&gt; better. It may smoke a little.&quot; This guy is really good with VW's, but
