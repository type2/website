&gt; I finally got my bus roadworthy and running well. I

&gt; &quot;pop&quot; (not audible) and it threw me in to the turn.
&gt; Afterwards while going striaght it kept pulling to the
&gt; right. It doesnt do this everytime, sometimes it's
&gt; just fine. What do i need to do??

Get the front end aligned.  Sounds like to much toe-in, off the top of my
fuzzy mind.


OR you could just have a bunch of worn out parts.  Drag link ends, tierod
ends, swinglever pin bushing, balljoints....all of this will add up to
keep your steering geometry out of wack, no matter what you do.  Which
might explain the randomness.
