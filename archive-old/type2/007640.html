On the face of it, I would agree with Timk11, and Charlie Ford. But 
scratch the surface of the matter and things don't line up.

Consider the cars and trucks associated with a given Navajo hogan along 
I-40 in eastern Arizona. Is such a collection more an indicator of greed 
than ONE shiny new F*rd Explorer parked in a driveway in Scottsdale? 

On the contrary, the urge to collect is usually explained by clinical 
psychologists as a means for asserting some control over something. You 
might then conclude that some of the collectors who have weighed in on 
this topic are deeply sick. By hey, that's just *their* sickness. We all 
reveal ours in due course.

More seriously, I just came up from my garage bay to find a letter from 
the apartment complex management taped to my door. I have &quot;violated the 
rules governing the La Jolla Colony Association&quot; by having &quot;an oil spill 
and a container of oil in parking space #6.&quot; (Parking space #6 is what 
they call my garage bay.) 

The clowns who own H*nd*s and get their oil changed at JiffyLube will 
never find such a note taped to their doors. The world is set up for them.

Not us. Whether we own one 20-year old bus or ten of them.

OR to put it another way, nobody on this list is the enemy.
