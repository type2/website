Subject: I sold my bus!

Folks, 
        My 79 bus was sold today to the first fella who looked at it.
He was impressed, and gave me the asking price.  This means I am 
on the lookout for a NICE Westy, breadloaf or Vanagon.
This is not a sad day, the bus is going to a very caring fella who 
actually was looking at Ghia's, but wanted a bus for his son...it's a happy 
day because now I can seriously look for a nice camper.
Take care All...I'm glad to get a way from the dreaded 79 :)
