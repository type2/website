&gt; &gt; stick in 6 times and come up with 5 readings

&gt; That's weird, I never really had that problem with the 1600 engine in my
&gt; Type 2. But I DO have problems reading the ATF-level in my 1971
&gt; Fastback, but that's a different mailinglist I guess. By the way: nobody
&gt; could help me there as well, so my advice is: just try to keep the oil
&gt; level as close to maximum as possible (as far as you can read it
&gt; anyway), a little bit too much oil won't hurt I think.

I have noted different readings depending upon how the dipstick is
handled.  I've found that putting the stick in rapidly and removing it
rapidly will result in a low reading.  I usually push it in, pull it up
slightly, seat it firmly, wait a couple of seconds, then pull it for a
reading, with much more consistent results.

Of course, it's important to let the engine sit for at least a few minutes
before checking, so the oil can drain back to the sump.  Otherwise the
reading will be low.

Note that it isn't such a good idea to keep the oil to the full mark at
all times.  I've found that oil blowby will increase above the midway
point.

After rereading the above paragraphs, I don't know whether to post it to
the Type2 list or submit it to Playboy...  :)
