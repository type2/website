Subject: Leaky fuel tank

I went for a long drive down the coast last weekend. In a moment of
extravagance I filled the fuel tank right to the top. Paid the attendant and
was just about to get back in when I heard a splashing sound, I looked under
the van and there was petrol pouring down all over the place. I couldn't see
where it was coming from exactly but it was pouring down both sides of the
gearbox.

It stopped dripping after about 15 minutes or so and I very gingerly set off
again, fire extinguisher at the ready, and completed my journey uneventfully
apart from a smell of gas in the rear (with new rear shocks, new tyres and a
new anti-sway bar at the front it was a great trip, I even got stopped for
speeding!). I have smelt gas before when the tank has been about 3/4 full
but never bad enough to be troublesome.

Obviously I won't fill the tank to the top again, but in the meantime how
worried should I be by this? The Haynes manual doesn't give many clues and
as far as I am aware I can't know what sort of tank I have until I've
dropped the engine and removed the firewall. Might it be a breather line
which has fallen off or rotted? Is this a common problem that other listees
have experienced?

My van is a 1978 westfalia with a 2.0 ltr twin carb engine. Any advice would
be much appreciated.
