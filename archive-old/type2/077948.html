I'll be honest, I don't know if mine will hold up, and rather expect it
won't, but with only about $14 in materials bought and $5 material USED, I
can try it again to impove the system. I do like to water heater insulation
idead, may have to try it when this dies.

I would like to add a belly pan over the center section of the bus someday,
and this prevent most water problem. It would also keep me from washing that
part in the winter, which could be VERY BAD. We'll see.

&gt; &lt;&lt; Added fiberglass wrap ($6.99_at_ Home Depot)&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; Only problem might be water retention by that 'glass wrap...How are you
&gt; sealing it against rain, etc.?

I think that the plastic backed fiberglass as sold for water heater
blankets would work fine.  Wrap it around several times, make sure the
edge os on the bottom, and that should keep water out nicely.
