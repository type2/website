&gt; Will this stand work for a type 4 motor????

Yes, but the bolting face is said to stress the case because there are no
arms to support it. It you look at Fig 15-8 on page 49 of Bentley's engine
and clutch chapter you'll see what I mean.
 
&gt; I've been thinking of building my own, using a tranny bell housing so
&gt; I can &quot;bench start&quot; the motor, but just the metal to build a &quot;sturdy&quot;
&gt; Frame would probably cost me more than the $39.99 for the stand above..

Incorporateing the bellhousing would be cool. I've seen homemade setups
before.
 
&gt; All the &quot;VW Engine&quot; stands I've found all say &quot;Not for Type 4 motors&quot;
&gt; So what's a driver to do?????

I don't think they're very good for Type 1 motor. They have a tippy design.
