&gt; This is a good setup for a few. We have one person locally that has claimed
&gt; all the used oil from the two local fast food joints. So the next person has
&gt; to drive at least 20 miles just to get used oil....

   Sooner'r later sombody's gonna offer a price for the oil and &quot;grease'l&quot;
 become a commodity instead of just an oddity... ;-(
