Subject: Re: Helicoils

Ok...  I admit, I have missed the recent thread on helicoils...

But spending 3 hours on Monday evening sitting in a mall parking lot
because a spark plug had worked itself loose (it is stripped as far as I
can tell) has me instantly interested.

Is there an archive on helicoil info?

And perhaps a stupid question, but will a loose spark plug decrease
compression and hence power?  I am presuming the answer is yes, but just
wanted to double check.

Can helicoils be done by folks such as myself, or does it require special
machinery and/or expertise?

Cheers,
