&gt; What are the latest thoughts on what to use for the staple strip when
&gt; installing new pop top canvass? My strip was old and hard and in spots
&gt; cracked into several peices. I looked at the big stores Lowes, Home depot, I
&gt; was thinking just a thin wood molding like yardstick size. I looked at the
&gt; vertical blinds too but they don't seem the come in replacement sizes long
&gt; enough. And I have looked at the rubber molding that goes around the
&gt; baseboard of walls (comes in rolls).

I couldn't find that stuff either. The old stuff seems to go brittle over
time.

I do know that GoWesty sells a similar tack strip. It's about a 1/3 the
thickness of the original.

It must be available someplace for less than 75 cents a foot...maybe an
upholstery shop could identify it.
 
&gt; Also, what to attach it with? Staples? Tacks? or what about screws and
&gt; finishing washers?

Staples work well but you'll need an electric staples to make the job goes
easier. I took out 281 staples so you're putting in about the same amount.

Most staples have a 3/8&quot; crown but the ones used in the bus were 1/2&quot;. FYI.
You'll want to use stainless steel or monel staples so they don't rust.
