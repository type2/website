Subject: Re: [T2] How long should it take for f.i. to start the engine?

&gt; My new 79 Westy seems to take at least 2 to 3 tries of 15-20 seconds
&gt; cranking before it will finally start. I was under the impression that it
&gt; should start on the first try in a couple of seconds? My 78 certainly did ,
&gt; this one requires too much cranking in my opinion. Any comments on this, or
&gt; am I asking too much?
&gt; Thanks,

Courtney,
An FI engine should start on the first turn of the key within a reasonable
number of engine revolutions and WITHOUT touching the gas pedal.

If it requires multiple tries as yours does there are a number of things
that could be to blame.  First check for vacuum leaks -- it's a good idea
to replace all the vacuum hoses anyway.

Also, hard starting is a typical symptom of an ignition system problem.
Especially check the point gap and adjust if necessary.  If it's been
10,000 miles since you last did, replace the points and condenser
entirely.  Check the condition of your spark plug wires, replace if
necessary.  Check the distributor cap carefully for cracks or carbon
tracks.  Replace if necessary.  Also check the contact surfaces on the
distributor rotor.  Replace if necessary.  Check the spark plugs.  Make
sure they are gapped properly and not fouled.  Replace if they are oil
fouled (then correct the source of the oil fouling) or if they are worn
out.  Don't forget to check the ignition timing!  If it's not set
correctly, it can cause hard starting.  Also remember to re-set the timing
if you adjust the points or replace them.  Changing the point gap changes
the ignition timing.

After you've checked that out you might want to look at the FI.  I had a
similar problem with my '79 and it turned out that the signal wire from
the
starter solenoid to the double relay was so corroded that it was not
sending the proper signal to the double relay to turn on the fuel pump.  I
could get the engine to start by flooring the gas pedal while cranking,
which apparently admitted enough air through the AFM that the fuel pump
switch in the AFM was triggered, starting the fuel pump and allowing the
engine to start.  I just had to clean up that connection and it works
great now.

Check the tightness of the cylinder head temp sensor and make sure it is
connected to the FI wiring harness.  Check the cold start valve and
thermo-time switch for function according to the Bentley manual.  If you
don't have the Bentley manual, go buy it now.  
Go through the FI system and check for loose wires and poor grounds as all
those can contribute.  The cold start valve and thermo-time switch are
something to look into if it's hard to start when the engine is cold but
it starts fine with the engine warm.  However, it's not the first thing
you should look at under those circumstances -- the ignition system and
the condition of the vacuum hoses is.

You should find the problem somewhere in there.  Don't jump to the FI
first as that's not usually the problem.
