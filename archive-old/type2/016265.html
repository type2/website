&gt; list - thanks for all the input concerning my bogging bus...i think the overwhelming conclusion is an icing problem, as others have related similiar problems w/the weber progressive setup. however, i have yet to hear a plausible setup for warming the manifold, as the 2.0 obviously has no heat risers. seems there's no practical way to recapture exhaust-warmed air other than robbing the heater box output, which i'm considering. has anyone done this? any thoughts on if this would be adequate when blowing directly over the manifold, or should the warm air be fed directly into the carb?

      Where does your crankcase breather go? It should be going into your air cleaner, which was enough to warm my Weber. You could also grab hot air from the little port over by the alternator which normally would go to the aircleaner too, to purge the gastank vent fumes.
