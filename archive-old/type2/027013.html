Man.

I just spent 5 hours under both ends of the 69 trying to get the gummed up 
crud out of the shift rod tube. Aparently, the bus sat immobile in the 
Aridzona desert for 5 years with non-existent shift rod boots and the grease 
in the tube had turned to shellac.

I used a length of 1/2&quot;EMT conduit to scrape the insides and dragged a sock 
on a woire throught there several times.

So I got my new Wolfsburg West shift rod bushings and boots to go on there. 
The first thing I noticed was there is no ridge on the end of the boots to 
help them stay on the end ridges of the shift rod tube.

Plus: the bushings were more like plastic rather than nylon. I would have 
thought they'd be a harder substance. AND the seams were very sloppy, so I 
had to get an exacto knife in there and slice the seam ridges off so it 
would seat against the tube. THEN the little plugs which fit into the holes 
in the shift rod were too big, like they were elongated. So I had to get the 
exacto again and shave them down. This took a considerable amount of time.

THEN once I had all that done, I go to slide the shift rod into the tube and 
the front bushing gets caught up on something in there (the grease nipple?) 
and when I pull it back out it is all mangled, so now I need another front 
shift rod bushing.

I think I will try someone else's this time.

Anyone else have a similar circumstance?  It's getting to the point where I 
wonder if replacing the OEM VW worn part with a &quot;new&quot; part is even worth it. 
Like the old worn part might be better then a shoddy new one.
