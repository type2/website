&gt; A follow up to a post from a few weeks ago.  My 14 year old son recently
&gt; advanced to the state science fair competition. His project was automobiles
&gt; and aerodynamics.  He compared and measured the drag of a 60's era VW bus to
&gt; a Beetle and a Lamborghini Diablo.
&gt;
&gt; He placed 4th in the state, junior division, engineering category.

Rick:
Tell us more about what he found out! I think busses were relatively slippery
even by modern standards, but would be interested in seeing a post directly from
him!
