&gt;OK I just managed to borrow a 46 mm socket and 3/4 inch drive, though it's
&gt;going to need a bit of an extension.

the twelve point socket should be used carefully ( possibly with heat ).
it will round off the nut. this is where snap-on quality excells...
 that other  (cheap) tool actually works quite well....

&gt;Before I do myself an injury, can anybody confirm which way I have to turn
&gt;the nut on the right hand side of the bus, to get it off. I know some
&gt;commercial vehicles have anticlockwise threads on wheel nuts, so might this
&gt;apply here?


confirmed, both nuts are the same, and remove ccw...
