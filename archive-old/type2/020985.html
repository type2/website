&gt; List,
&gt;
&gt; While gathering info for this 71 bus engine, i have learned that there may be
&gt; beetle cases that can be drilled and tapped for the rear bar.
&gt; This is cool.
&gt;
&gt; I have also learned tentatively that i may not be able to run the full-flow
&gt; oil pump cover because it won't clear the rear bar.
&gt; Any thoughts?
&gt;
&gt; thanks,

Clark:
I used a full flow cover on my double cab's engine (stock 1600 SP). This is not
the cover that the filter attaches to, but rather a hose which runs to a remote
filter which I mounted where  the coil goes ala 356 Porsche. The return line goes
back to the case. This is probably not quite the best system as it might allow
drain down under certain conditions. (on the Porsche it was a bypass system,
therefore no danger of air in its arteries.)It still took several hours cutting
and fitting the hoses around the sheetmetal to make it look safe and not bypass
much cooling air.
