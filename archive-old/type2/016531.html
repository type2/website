&gt; I remember &quot;Gasohol being available in limited areas of New Jersey in the late

In Iowa, nearly all the gas stations offer a 10% ethanol mix.  We call it
gasohol.  The octane is usually 2 points higher than the &quot;premium&quot; fuel, and it is
cheaper due to a tax break for a renewable energy fuel source.  I've used nothing
else for the past 10 years.  It works fine in all the vehicles on the road here.
The oil companies really don't like giving up that much market share though.
