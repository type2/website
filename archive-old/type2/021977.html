And if you do further research EXXON Corp, posted there highest earnings in
HISTORY, artificially inflated fuel prices mean high profits for the gas
companies and larger electric bills for those that live in Cali.
FWIW. AZ. power plants that have been sitting idle are stockpiling diesel
fuel to fire the plants back up to sell high priced electricity to Cali.

Well, if people keep spreading this sort of hysteria, it  might happen
since we'll be softened up for it.  I'm sure that they would love to
charge us $3 a gallon!

OTOH, the Lundburg survey, who keeps careful track of fuel prices, notes
that imports of oil and refinery production are up to mid-summer levels
already and wholesale prices are actually down.  Any further price
increases or even keeping prices at current levels are due to price
gouging, not economic reasons.

I'm not cancelling my summer trip, in any case.
