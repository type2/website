While we were moving our '71 westfalia from the front of the house to 
the
driveway last night, the engine caught fire. We're not sure why.
This is what's left:
interior, slightly damp:

rear interior:

(that half of the mattress was damaged beyond saving, the rest is fine)

The van has some other issues, such as wonky steering, but that's 
fixable.
The engine is, of course, toast. The inside is fine, but well used, with
warping laminate inside the ceiling, and an absent tent in the popup. 
The
headlights and wheels are good.

We were going to call the wrecking yards, but this thing still has some
useful parts, and *might* be rebuildable.

Anyone want it for free, before I call the wrecking yards? We live in
Fremont, California, halfway between Oakland and San Jose, so I assume 
it'd
only be interesting to someone in the bay area, and whoever wants it 
would
have to come get it.

Mary
