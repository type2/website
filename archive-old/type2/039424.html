Subject: SVDA distributor

Hello all,
I've looked into the archives and found nothing about SVDA distributors
offered by John at Aircooled.Net.

I had at the beginning a 009 on a '72 westy with a 1700cc and a 32/36
weber. It wouldnt run very good because of the known flat spot. I had in
a box left by the previous owner the original vacuum dizzy so temptation
to try it was big. Difference was great, the bus was going much better.
But that stock dizzy became pretty worn out. There is a play between the
2 plates, so it makes it very difficult to adjust the points and make it
work right. So I think I  must change (or find good parts for) dizzy
anyway.

I definately want to go with mag-fire instead of points. Would it be a
good choice for a SVDA ? And would an SVDA be a good one for a 1700cc
engine with Weber carb (i have a place on it to hook the advance vacuum
and would left the retard unconnected).

Finally i still have a good working 009. Is it possible to make a kind
of SVDA with it and some vacuum dizzy parts?

Cheers,
Martin, Québec, Canada
