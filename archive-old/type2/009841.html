	My beloved brother and I checked and discovered a $400 per person
per visit customs limit when we made our walking trip from San Diego
to Tijuana for aircooled parts. Pre-NAFTA. Our aggregate purchase of a 
complete electronic ignition for their beetle and a turn signal for our 
single/cab  didn't exceed $400 (Visa card bills ready to prove it) but 
in practice the custom's guys dind't even speak to us as we walked back 
across the border. You could have had $4K worth of Weber carbs or something
in the same size bag as we were carrying. Not that I'd advise anyone
to break the law, or even push it.

	I order stuff over the net/by mail/fax from Japan, Canada,
New Zealand &amp; England pretty regularly and have never had (so far) to pay 
duty. Most packages coming to me were in the $50-200 range and contained 
books, model airplanes, decals or some mix of the three.
In addition to that, I've traded things back and forth from all
those countries as well as with people in the Netherlands, South Africa, 
Austrailia and Uruguay. Never had any comment from or contact with
USA Customs. 

	I just ordered some china from a place that advertizes the
ability to provide Wedgewood patterns no longer imported into the USA-
they say that customs duty assesment on china shipments to USA is
semi-random. All packages are clearly marked for content and value,
some customers report having to pay duty to get their package from
the post office, some report no such experience. If you take $25%
of $100 you still haven't paid for much government attention. I would
expect small packages are spot checked at most. I'd also expect that
a package that stands out by wieght, size or smell will get extra
attention.
