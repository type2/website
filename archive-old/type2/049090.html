Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for an A series case

andy sends:

&gt;&gt; Our most recent rebuild is based on a 1976 Bug case.  It's the latest alloy,
&gt;&gt; the same as is used for Type 4 engine cases.  Basically aluminum rather than
&gt;&gt; magnesium alloy like the older bus cases.
&gt;
&gt; Is this right?

In 1975 (IIRC), Volkswagen switched its German-made Type 1 engine production
from AS41 magnesium alloy to AS21 magnesium alloy...yes, it's the latest
alloy; no, it's still magnesium.
