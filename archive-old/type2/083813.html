Subject: Re: [T2] monitoring 2 batt with one voltmeter

Just in case anyone else is wondering...  (the poles vs. throws on
switches are a dyslexic's choice slice of hell), see this handy page to
explain the different kinds of switches...

http://www.eaoswitch_dot_com/about/forms.htm

I think what George is calling for is switch form C to connect the
voltmeter to one or the other battery.

&gt; &gt; I follow your method with two switches, and correct me if I'm wrong,
&gt; &gt; but don't you mean DPST to get away with one switch? How would you not
&gt; &gt; 'crossfeed' the batteries with SPST? Wouldnt' both the battery leads
&gt; &gt; be on one side of the switch and the connection to the meter on the other
&gt; &gt; for basic on/off operation this way? You would get an average of the
&gt; &gt; two voltages (parallel ckt).
&gt;
&gt; Hmmm, have to think about that a bit.  What I should have said was &quot;SPDT&quot;
&gt; not &quot;SPST&quot;.  You want a switch that will connect your voltmeter to either
&gt; of two wires.  The voltmeter connects to the center terminal of the
&gt; switch, while each battery wire connects to one of the end terminals
