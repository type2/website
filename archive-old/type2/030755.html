Subject: heat riser gaskets
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.GSO.4.02A.9902160919290.20826-100000_at_user2.teleport_dot_com&gt;


I have two kinds of heat riser gaskets. One type has a large hole, one
type has a small hole. The ones that I'm replacing, have a large hole.
What is the difference? Do the ones with the small holes increase the
vacuum or anything?
