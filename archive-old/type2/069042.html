Subject: Re: the logic behind the 12-point tool

In a message dated 96-11-22 12:30:05 EST, you write:

&lt;&lt; Now the question: Does the triple-square tool have some advantage over
 the common 12-point arrangement in terms of being able to apply
 torque?  Is it better than an Allen wrench?
  &gt;&gt;

Rodney,

Torqx, D-slot, tri-square and other socket-head fasteners of recent vintage
were designed to facilitate automated assembly of components.  The reason for
everyone using different types usually has to do with patents, manufacturing
licenses, tool magazine designs (from the assembly-robot manufacturer) and so
forth.  

With rare exceptions, bolts of standard design provide maximum clamping
pressure, the solid, forged head being stronger than any design having
head-design containing a recess or one drilled for safety wire.
