Subject: Making a heat sheild?

list,
Well, this looks like it might be an NLA - BusBoys suggests a boneyard.

Does anyone happen to have a pic of a heat shield from a type4 bus they could
send me? I betcha i could fab one of these daddies with a couple pop cans,
spit and some bailing twine. That's a joke. ;-D
I do want a pic, though.

TIA,
clark
