&gt; Driving home from DocRic's several years ago, my bus quit...
&gt; (Mechanic) said, &quot;Try this.  Pour some cold water over
&gt; the fuel pump when it happens again.  Prop the lid open to keep the fuel pump
&gt; cooler.&quot;  So I did.  And it worked.  Every twenty miles or so, Lurch would
&gt; quit, I would jump out and pour water over the fuel pump, and Lurch was good
&gt; for another little while.

I had this same problem returning from Wyoming to WIsconsin.  Bus would just
stop.  Problem started as I ascended a mountain pass, and was severe
crossing the eastern desert-like plains of eastern Wyoming.  Just letting
the van sit there would get it on the road for 10 miles or so.  I saw other
vans toolng along with the deck lid open.  Tried that.  No dice.  With
nightfall the temperature dropped and I drove in the cool air as far as the
Missouri River in Dakota.  The eventual fix was simple...the fuel filter was
clogged and in hot weather would shut the bus down.  Standard procedure
before every long trip I change the fuel filter. Easy and cheap and no
problems since.

As long as I mentioned Wyoming, on almost every trip I have taken out to
that wonderful state I have taken on  a load of really bad gas that scares
the he*l out of me...engine starts hesitating and in general running poorly.
(Do all long distance Bus drivers monitor every spin of the engine or is it
just me...do we all have nightmares envisioning breakdown in some desolate
place?  I began to be sure the next trip would be the last...that was at
145K.  I have since travelled in that same bus enough to go around the earth
twice without a problem.  I have decided to stop worrying, enjoy the drive,
work around problems, and if it craps out totally leave it and take a
bus/train home and be happy for the great rides!) Anyway, when I get home
(having fed the van lots of heet) it clears out over several weeks and
things are OK.

On one trip I started using Marvel Mystery Oil, a &quot;top lubricant&quot;, and
perhaps coincidentally had no more problems.  Have used it since, about 4 oz
every fill.  Maybe it absorbs water and breaks down contaminants and keeps
gas moving through the fuel filter?

Just after I returned from one trip I saw a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; that detailed
episodes of industrial waste being &quot;disposed of&quot; by being mixed into gas
that was sold in cut rate gas stations in Wyoming and I think Montana as
well.  Reporters said there was very poor monitoring of the gas...has this
changed?  Last time I was out there I tried to avoid the low priced stations
next to the interstates and fueled up only in town at the Shell or Mobil or
whatever.
