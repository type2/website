Subject: hub diameter?

A request to those of you who might have an easily accessible late model
loaf brake drum lying around. I'm about to order wheel adapters to mate
Porsche wheels to my '75 Camper, but am unfortunately &quot;stuck&quot; in Paris,
thousands and thousands of miles away from my beloved bus... ;-)

I need to know the diameter of the wheel hub, or equivalently, the inside
diameter of the center hole of a brake drum. From memory, it should be
somewhere between 60 and 70 mm.

Thanks much in advance!

Joyeux Noël!

Sami
