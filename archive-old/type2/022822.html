Subject: Bay 4wd prototypes, rambling, long too
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

This probably should be a Friday question, but I was unable to post last 
Friday and I'm not patient enough to wait 'till next Friday, and there is Bus 
content, so here goes.
I have a book called &quot;Automuseum Wolfsburg&quot; that is a guide to the VW factory 
museum.  In it there is a late bay bus 4WD prototype.  It says that it was a 
forerunner of the Synchros.  Neat to look at. 
Now, is there anyway that anyone can think of that a VW transaxle, either bug 
or bus, can be tapped to provide an output for a driveshaft to go to the 
front of the vehicle to provide an auxiliary drive for the front wheels?  It 
was done for the Schwimmwagen, but I've never seen one of those close up to 
see how it was done.
I want to build an amphibious vehicle (not out of my Westy or Doublecab!) and 
with my sincere VW leanings I would love to use VW parts for it. The only 
drawback that I can see to using VW parts is the lack of front wheel (4 
wheel) drive to pull it out of the pond, lake, or whatever after a swim.
VW did it, so I assume that it is at least possible to get an auxiliary 
output from the transaxle.  I don't think that it will be easy.
If anyone could shed some light on this, or has tried it, or would like to 
discuss it, or whatever, please drop me an email.  (Can a Subaru ring and 
pinion be flipped so that a VW  motor could adapted to it and be rear mounted 
with the Subaru 4WD system used??)
If anyone has a Schwimmer (or Amphicar) anywhere near Wheeling, WV and would 
be willing to let me take a peek at it, please email me as well.
Lastly, and bus content, there was a white doublecab 'boat' pictured on the 
last page of VW Trends magazine sometime in the last year or so that had been 
converted to a boat.  Does anyone know anything more about that?
Sorry for the long ramblings, but there is a very diverse and helpful group 
on this list, and it's quite a resource to be able to pick your brains.
Thanks
