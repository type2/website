As I've mentioned many times before, the sump sender and the dipstick
sender measure at exactly the same location.  The difference is that with
the sump sender, you don't have to remove it and insert the dipstick every
time you want to check your oil, and you don't have bothersome wires
hanging around the rear of your engine.  You made the correct choice IMO.
