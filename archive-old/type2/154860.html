Subject: RE: [T2] Timing Scale

&gt; I can't find it on the busdepot web page hmmmm. I also used
&gt; the part # 021-119-249E. Then did a word search...no luck. I
&gt; may call them when they open. I have a feeling they don't
&gt; have them. Meg


We don't. VW discontinued them (after all, who needs to time their engine?
:-) and we sold all we had. We will have a repro, probably at the end of the
year.
