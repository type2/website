I've been through my brakes but this is something that needs some more
attention. When I pump my brake pedal the first time I stop the way I have
come to expect my bus to stop. If you pump the pedal a couple of times you
have better pressure and &quot;more stop&quot;. I have replaced the master cylinder
and bled the brake lines, actually replaced all the fluid but this is still
the case. It's not really spongy, just doesn't seem to be as positive a feel
as I'd like. I was talking with a fried about this a while back and he told
me that his 78 had touchier brakes than his Jetta. My bus is vacuum assist
but there is no way it even comes close to anything else I have owned with
&quot;power&quot; brakes. What up?

I'm going fishing on the Outside of Vancouver Island in Beautiful British
Columbia end of next week and I'd kinda like it to be all better by then.
Quite a drive, a little like the Alcan in some parts.

TIA
