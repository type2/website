Hey gang,

Marcus made a point about Busses (his '79 anyway) being able to cruise at
speeds substantially in excess of 70 mph, contrary to what's shown on the
chart (at http://www.instability_dot_com/vw/aero.html ).

The discrepancy may be attributed to some or all of the following:

1) The frontal area that I used to calculate the power required curve was
obtained using a tape measure and my eyeball. It's not accurate at all,
and was only intended to be in the ballpark. This is the likely source for
most of the error.

2) The power available curve is for David Schwarze's 2.0l engine with
carbs; I could believe that fuel injection would produce a bit more
power. Also, I used a common drive ratio for a '72, and I belive the ratio
for a '79 is somewhat lower. David notes that he has newer dyno runs
showing better power output, too. My guess is that the dyno test data that
I used is probably about right for a 1700 - 1800 engine in top tune.

3) The curves I plotted are for sea level standard 
conditions.  Local atmospheric conditions could produce less drag or
higher horsepower available from the engine, (although probably
not both at the same time!) resulting in higher top speed.

4) The drag coefficient of 0.38 was from a list member, and I haven't been
able to verify it. It sounds about right to me, but a little difference
would shift the power required curve.

If anyone has material related to Bus aerodynamics, please pass it on to
me and I'll add it to the web page! Wind tunnel photos, publications,
whatever.

Thanks,

-chad
