Subject: Washing yo engine....

The fellow I bought my van from this past week had the most 
immaculate, clean and squeaky engines on his cars and vans
I have ever seen.  I asked him what he did to keep them that way
(other than stopping all spraying oil) and he said he just dumped
any soapy car wash water from his bucket when he was through
cleaning the outside then rinses.  Said that it kept residual film and road
dust from adhering to the engine. The water was probably warm
since he said he uses slightly hot water when he washes. Don't know
if it hurts the electrical, etc., but he has been doing this for years. Does
anyone know if you need to let the motor dry out before cranking?
