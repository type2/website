&gt; Dr. Frankenstein lives dep't:  This was a real piece of work---a Westfalia
&gt; crewcab!  Someone had chopped off a hardtop Westy (or bus w/camper windows,
&gt; couldn't see) behind the sliding door and added a tiny pickup bed.  Possibly
&gt; the goofiest bus I've seen, and......it's for sale!  See it in Costa Mesa on
&gt; Placentia Ave. between Victoria and 19th.  Hurry, it could be yours!

It's a '73 station wagon with auto trans.  Straight body
panels, white and orange.  It's up for grabs at about $1K.
The seller cut the rear hatch frame 'heel' off the breadloaf
and welded it on behind the middle seat.  This makes a sort
of 2-door doublecab walkthru look.  The sliding door is fixed;
does not slide because the upper rear track is gone.  It's a
project.  Needs a donor lower rear hatch frame welded in to
close up the aft cabin area.       Creative effort! 
Seller lives on Pomona Ave near 19th.
