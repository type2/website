Subject: O2 sensors and Oil pressure

  I have a new toy . . . . . .

 Just got out of a hospital - - - - no big deal I just died a couple
times. Word of advice here. Dom't grow hair on your chest.
 Those paddles will do you serious injury as in burns

 While in there, they have this little wrap-around finger cuff that 
makes you look like ET.

 As in it glows red.  It's an O2 sensor. Reads right thru the skin.

 Has a DB15 plug on the end and hookd up to a simple belt type VOM?

 They wouldn't let me take it apart to check but I did cop the sensor.

 How it works I have no idea but I shall die finding out.

 The thing can't cost more than $2.

 The OIL thing:   you guys ever read your books? (Tom Wilsons)

 42 psi is what the first relief is set at using 30w oil at 2500 rpm
at 158F (70C). Bypass the cooler. Dumps excess to sump.
 Regulator actually.

 Second one is set the same but on other end of the galleys and is mainly a
hi- rev relief. Dumps back to sump.

 There is a 28 psi &quot;wear limit&quot; which I assume means it could be as 
low as 14 psi.

 The sending unit is calibrated to warn you of pressures at 2.1 - 6.4
psi (0.15-0.45 kg/cm sq).

 I know Mr Hoover has spoken on the subject but those oil pumps are 
a lousy design without proper &quot;tuning&quot; (my own latest &quot;doom-say&quot;)

 Second, have any of you EVER checked your spring rates or did you 
just jam them back in?

 Now a small Poem, passed down thru generations of my ancestors.
Good Irish Lads for the most part. It's mom you couldn't keep home.

 &quot;If he play, being young and unskillful, for sheckels of silver and
gold. Take his money, my son, praising Allah. For the youth was 
ordained to be sold&quot;.
