Subject: Re: Bus Fridges

Just to add a comment on Dave's bus fridge treatise regarding the installed
3-way bus fridge:

Dave wrote:
&quot;These types of fridges have an advantage in that they are very quiet, but
they only work well when completely level - a 3 degree tilt will mess it
up.&quot;

My experience with mine ('79 westy 2- way, no propane) is that it can be
difficult to start up if it is not completely level.  However, once
started, it seems to work regardless of whether the bus is level or not.
I've found that the most effective way to get mine started is to turn it
on, then drive the bus a little to help it get started, and then you can
park pretty much anywhere once its started.  Of course, it only seems to
keep things cool if they are already cold.  Its never been very effective
for making something cold that started out being warm!  I think its more of
a neat novelty than anything.  Its not big enough to carry enough adult
beverage for my camping needs, so I always pack a cooler.
