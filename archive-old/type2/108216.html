&gt;74 Bus with 2L engine. I am replacing the original 002 transmission
&gt;with a later (76 on) 091 transmission.

&gt; I am planning to keep the old
&gt;flywheel with 215 mm clutch and the 74 bell housing and starter. Which
&gt;input shaft do I need to use - the shorter old 002 one or the later long
&gt;091 one? Or can I use either one?

I used the 091 Transmission and Input shaft, the 002 Bell housing (only
because I didn't have a 091 Starter)
and a 1974 1800 with the 1800 clutch/flywheel. The 091 input shaft is longer
and it makes the installing
the engine a bit more difficult, but just leave the exhaust, muffler and
rear tin off until the engine is in and
you can squeeze it in okay. I don't know if you can use the 091 Bell Housing
or the 002 input shaft as options
as I didn't try them. 10k and no problems. Oh and thanks for the heater
boxes David they're still on there.
