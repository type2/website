Hi

I just got back from Seattle, about 400 miles from where I live.
I got 20 mpg on the high way, between 55-60 there, 60-65 on the
way back.

I agree with George - I've never heard of a Bus getting 25mpg unless
its all down hill. Twenty was the best I thought I could get with the
motor still somewhat of a mystery to me.

Pete

I normally get an honest 18MPG.  On a good day I might get 20.

This is in a well-maintained, stock, '71 station wagon.

I take claims of 25+mpg in a bus with a grain of salt, unless
the owner has gone to great lengths to obtain such good mileage.
