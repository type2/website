&gt; As far as I know, there are three different gaskets on the head of a VW

&gt; Intake manifold gasket - T1 SP motors have a copper ring
&gt;                          T1 DP motors have a thin sheet-metal gasket,
&gt;                             probably mild steel sheet
&gt;                          T4 carb engines have a thin sheet-metal gasket,
&gt;                             probably also mild steel sheet
&gt;                          T4 FI engines have a fiber/bakelite-looking
&gt;                             sandwich

You can get fiber gaskets for the DP 1600.  My feeling is that they are
less prone to vacuum leaks than the metal gaskets for the intake manifold.
