Subject: '75 motor mounts

From where the &quot;L&quot; block mount picks up the threaded(short) stud on the rubber
mount whose other end goes into the cross mount bar, which way does the short
threaded end go into the block mount, with the &quot;long side&quot; parallel to the
motor flange, sticking out underneath the mount towards the back of van, or
across and under the two flanges. Sorry if it sounds confusing, but I have
looked at every manual I have, and the seemingly loical way, &quot;long side&quot;
parallel to mount flanges, is the way to go, but the threaded stud, does not
want to go easily into that square hole on the bottom of the &quot;L&quot; flange, and I
don't want to wreck these new rubber mounts.  Can you help?
Thanks.
Sid
