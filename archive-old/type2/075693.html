hey  I heat my van with electric heater,  ok I can't drive very far with
it on, the extension cord isn't that long.   but I have used it to preheat
the interior on a cold morning so that gas heater doesn't have as much
work to do.

&gt; Matty, Biggest deep-cycle batt. you can put under your rear seat: 210 amp 
&gt; hours. Heater will deplete this in 1.4 hrs.(210 amp hrs. is &quot;rated&quot;, it ain't 
&gt; what you're gonna get out of it in the real world) Time to recharge off of a 
&gt; 55amp. alt with 3 batts _at_ 2300rpm constant speed, 10.73 hours, no load other 
&gt; than to charge all three batts. _at_ ambient temp of 49 deg. f. Moral of the 
&gt; story: You can't violate the Laws of Physics. Why doesn't anybody get this? 
&gt; Electric heat for a bus is just not doable. If it were, the factory would 
&gt; have already done so.
