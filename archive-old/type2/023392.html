The 211 941 531E fits all type 2 buses from 1971 to 1979, the 531 A should
actually read 311 941 531A which fits 1968 to 1970 type 2's  and other VW's

ps. depending on manufacturer, generally the German switchs do not come with
the bezel and the import, Taiwain, Brazil, Mexico, Pakastan and/or India do
come with the bezel.

Quick question (I hope)
I wish to replace my headlight switch for my 71 westy. Bus depot has part 
number &quot;211 941 531E&quot; for 71 thru 79, and &quot;211 941 531A&quot; for like 68-70. 
Mine currently says &quot;211 941 531&quot; - NO LETTER. Will the &quot;E&quot; part work fine? 
How about the &quot;A&quot; one? Anybody know the term numbers on each? I sent an 
email to Bus Depot and haven't yet heard a reply. Also - when you order 
these switches - do they come with the escutcheon?(The little ring that 
holds it into the dash) - mine is missing and my rheostat shot switch is 
currently dangling from the dash by the wires....
wink
