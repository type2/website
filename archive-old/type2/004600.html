are you sure the pt nu# isn't 113 255 355D, this is the accordian tube for a

66/67 beetle.(change the first 3 to 211 and you have bus) All the numbers I
have for the accordian tubes end in 355 with different letters for diffeent
models. if the number you stated is 355D it should measure 60 mm on one end
and 64mm on the other.

Jim,

Are we talking about the same part ? , the part i am
replacing has two part numbers on it, one on each end,
113 255 358D, 211 255 358.  When I do a search for
that part at the bus depot it comes up with nothing ?

confused here !
