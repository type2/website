Subject: Re: [T2] electric fuel pump.

 
E-mail message   
 
&lt;&lt;From: aufever_at_prodigy_dot_net Karl

On any fuel injected vehicle, the main electric fuel pump is ALWAYS
below the tank and is gravity feed. The pump is a pusher, not a puller. 
Slide under any VW bus or Mercedes and look where the pump is mounted.&gt;&gt;

Ok Karl, then please explain where the suction is coing from on the
inlet side of the pump. 

Turn on the pump and stick your pinky up against it--it'll drw it right
to the inlet side.

It must be sucking fuel too.

In 87 BMW did away with the transfer pump--  one pump did all--- it drew
the fuel from the tank and pressurized to the injector's.

I suppose this question all depends on who's got what---on what.

But in an accessory type pump situation, like where the manual pump in a
type 2 Bus ( excluding injection ) has been replaced with an electric
accessory pump, it does both--pulls as well as pushes.

Later,
