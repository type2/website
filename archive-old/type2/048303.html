Subject: [T2] Tow Dolly

Greetings All, 

I am planning on towing my '77 manual transmission bus about 50 miles on a
two-wheeled dolly, and wondered if I needed to do anything to protect the
transmission (besides taking it out of gear). Is it better to raise up the
front or rear? Thanks for any suggestions.

Jonathan
