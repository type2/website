thanks karl i couldnt find a part number or find it in the transmission section ...
good lord i cant believe that thing is 20 bucks.... man ole man ... well i will say this.. wont be the last 20 they get out of me and surely hasnt been the only 20 they have gotten out of me just this month... 
bus depot has broke me lately but i am fixing to be really really happy about the spending when i hear that 2 ltr crank up the first time in a few days now to go..
... sure wished they had a picture so that i could tell how out of wack mine is maybe it can be taken off and bent back correctly?
be my luck i would break it though lol.. better go ahead and put this on my wish list.... for next order...
still if anyone has one that they think may be in better condition than mine possibly give me a holler..........
peace
Chris

I think your 79 bracket is FUBAR big time.

According to ETKA, the trans bracket is the same from 68 to 79!
