Subject: electric burner in a westy? and FS: '77 Bus &amp; '73 Westy

While we were up in northern Georgia we peeked through the windows of
various westys and in a '74 we saw an electric burner instead of the
typical propane!  Is this a common option?  I seems like an electric
burner would draw too much current to be useful.

         FOR SALE   '77 BUS VERY GOOD CONDITION $600
                                '73 WESTY VERY GOOD CONDITION $1000

                        OR MAKE AN OFFER (WE PROBABLY WON'T REFUSE)
we are moving 1600 miles away in one week and must sell these before we
leave!!!
