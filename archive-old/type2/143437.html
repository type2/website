&gt; I wouldn't put the rag in the plug hole however. What if it got sucked

Hey Guys  What are the chances of that happening  and the head has to come 
off anyway .  I said to put the rag in the tin hole to keep any oil from 
splashing all over. or just duct tape the hole .  I drove my 59 panel back from 
Circle yar wagens on 3 clylinders when a Junk Mofoco head gave up getting me there  
 250 miles  little slow going up hill but I made it.  $0 miles shouldnt be 
any problem. later and have fun  Mark Dearing
