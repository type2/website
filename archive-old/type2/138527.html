&gt;Any other former/present owners of LBC (Little British Cars) who went
&gt;to VW's so they'd at least have something running to go for parts care
&gt;to commmiserate... ?-)

I bought my westy to drive in the winter because I thought it'd be warmer 
than my convertible MGB.

Duh.

Live and learn I guess..........
