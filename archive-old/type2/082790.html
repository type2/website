Subject: Re: [T2] Tires Again??

You do not want to run a tire with less than 1540 pounds load rating as
this is the rating specified by VW.  This is particularly important for a
camper, as you are going around loaded all the time.

I've gone the floppy tire route and paid the price with two tread
separations within 100 miles.  Since then I've run Bridgestone RD603Vs in
185R15 load range D with good handling, good wear, and no problems.
