Subject: Re: [T2] Friday - your next camper?

I sort of like the fact that the camper doesn't look like your  
typical land yacht we see on the road.

Plus, after WWIV officially kicks off, heading to the safety of the  
Arctic Circle is assured.

Interior was fantastic. Anyone besides me notice the Apple Titanium  
Powerbook in its custom holder?

SWEET!

That is one camper I wouldn't mind having.
