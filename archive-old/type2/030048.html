Attention all ye Type2 nuts...

Tomorrow I've got to move the lenti.type2_dot_com server from its current
resting place at my previous employer (where we brought it after the
seattle quake shook it up..) to a temporary location at a friends house.
It will still be in Savannah.




this should only take me half an hour to 45 minutes to drive it across
town.  DNS propogation /should/ only take about 15 seconds thanks to some
changes i made a week ago.

Just in case, and for all of you who use the IP address for anything...

NEW IP Address for anything.type2_dot_com:  216.166.222.133
(effective tomorrow of course.)

Sorry I cant do this in the middle of the night, I have to work with the
timeslots given by my old employer and also of its new /temporary/ home.


so thats that.  thanks.

....david
