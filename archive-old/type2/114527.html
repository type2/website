Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust Questions

&gt;I walked out to my Bus today and noticed that one of my mufflers was 
&gt;hanging at an unusual angle.  Upon closer inspection, I noticed that 
&gt;one of the welds holding the muffler to the pipe was broken, and the 
&gt;engine's vibrations had opened a crack in the inlet pipe to the 
&gt;muffler.  It appears that the mufflers just rusted too much for the 
&gt;weld to hold, and it let go.

I had a similar experience with an empi exhaust.  Lasted about 1500 miles.
I was on a road trip and noticed the bus had got a lot louder so I pulled
over and had a peek.  Saw that the muffler was torn right where the weld was
on the side that bolted up to the pipe that connected it to both heat
exchangers.  Didn't see anyway to fix it in the middle of nowhere so I went
on.  About 50 miles later it got a LOT louder.  Whole damned thing had
fallen off!  Hope it didn't hit anything.  

Went to the stainless steal stock style from Bus Depot.  Much quiter, very
nice looking, and 4 years/37000 miles later it's still good as new.  But I
have a really strong suspicion that the 914 2.0 motor I'm running needs a
little less back pressure.  If you find a decent quality, better-than-stock
flowing alternative, please let me know!
