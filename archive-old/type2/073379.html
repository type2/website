Subject: From Seattle NG - bugs

 Saw this in Seattle for sale newsgroup - posted ~2PM on Sunday:
Reply to address at bottom, not me.

We just bought a house that came with 3 VW bugs in various states of
assembly. We understand one runs and that a 2nd was bought for parts for
the 3rd. There are tons of new windows, gaskets and many many other parts
and pieces. We understand that one bug is a 65 and another a 63.

We don't quite know what all is out there or what it is all worth. But the
guy who was going to take it all moved and doesn't have room for any more
projects.

Come check it all out, name your price, and it's yours to haul away. We
are in Snohomish, near Monroe. Email me if you'd like to come out and make
an offer.
