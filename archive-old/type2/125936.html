I was listening to you, until you said &quot; When the pump is on, it's vacuum
creates a decrease in pressure on the A side. So it sucks the fuel.&quot;

Everyone knows there is no such thing as suction,,, the now relatively higher
pressure on the tank side pushes the fuel into the pump area with lower
pressure,,,

I know you knew that!

To see this a bit better,,&lt;my way&gt; :-) I learned this from an elder on the VB list,,
Clara!

 imagine the molecules as Hamsters. Those hamsters
fill the system,,, when the pump starts, they get push to the low pressure area,,
some come from the return line, some from the tank,,, and then they go through
the pump, and around the fuel ring,, some drop into the cylinders and out the
exhaust,,
There is a small gate they have to sqeeze thru,&lt;regulator&gt; and this slows them down
allowing
the pump to put more in and increasing the pressure on them. Jast after the gate,
there is few
hamsters to fill the pipe and the pressure drops off..
Back at the T,, the ones that return from the gate head towards the pump, and some more
are needed to replace the ones that went out the exhaust ,,so more come in from the
tank,,
 as the rest just keep running around the fuel ring thru the gate, thru the T, back
to the pump,
till their turn comes to get pushed through the injectors and out the tail pipe,
them more pile in
to take their place.
