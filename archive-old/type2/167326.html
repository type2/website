Subject: First start in a few months.

Well, my daily driver, a '73 Safare w/ a 2L Hydraulic has sat quietly  
unmoving in front of  my house while I've been traveling with work  
for the last few months. It hasnt been started or anything in that  
entire time. The battery seems to be fine all the lights come on etc  
on dash, however I was wondering what protocol would be recommended  
to make that first start the least painful for her.
I'm going to assume the lifters will take a long time to pump up and  
I dont want to have a particularly hard start.

Any and all tips on what I should do before I start up my bus would  
be appreciated. You tell'em to me and I will make it happen ;) I was  
planning on checking the valve train and making sure all my hoses  
were in good shape, should I do a cold oil change ?

Thanks !
