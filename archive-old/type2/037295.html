Subject: RE:Getting impatient-looking for a bus

Hey All,
I would have to agree with most of what Chris
said. I just yesterday bought my 5th Bus. I paid
$100 for it. But I would not say that everyone
should go looking for a cheap bus. I have never
paid more than $100 for a Bus. My 77 was all
original, new paint, ran great. It had a bad
starter on it and so I could not start it, I
offered $100 and he took it. The 74 I just got,
it runs, but need a T/O bearing or cross shaft or
something with the clutch. 
  Up here in Washington Busses are all over,
mostly rust free and very cheap. Some people give
Busses away. In the north east I know this is a
very different story, a $100 Bus may not even be
good for parts. 
  You have to decide if you want to spend time
fixing you new Bus and spending money on it but
save up front, or buy on that is near perfect and
just drive. 
  I love to work on VW's. I currently own 4. 
  So no one is wrong for spending $3500 for a Bus
 and then $1500 to ship it if it is worth it to
them, but no one is wrong to spend $100 on a bus
localy and then $4000 to make it what they want.
Just know what you want and what you are willing
to pay, then don't get in too much of a hurry.
  Also let the list know what you want and how
far you will go to get it and we will help you.
There are a lot of real good people on this list,
99% will go out of our way to help another
listee.
Good luck Bus hunting! 

 &gt;The '72 Westy here that I  can't get for a
 &gt;penny under 4k is going to cost another 2500
 bucks to get the windshield rust
 &gt;problem and a couple of other spots and dings
 fixed and then painted. It does
 &gt;have a pancake w/12k on it, but I'll still
 have 6500 in the thing and some of
 &gt;you have already said that's too much.
 &gt; 
&gt; Forget about this bus. Anybody who isn't
&gt; budging when you wave 3800 cash under
&gt; his nose, is not the type of person you want to
&gt; buy a bus from. 
&gt; In other words, you don't want to spend a huge
&gt; amount on a bus. The most I ever
&gt; spent was $1500
&gt; for my first bus, which was mint, but it was a
&gt; mistake, because I didn't know a
&gt; thing about keeping it alive and ended
&gt; up losing it anyway. After that I found a copy
&gt; of the Idiot book and read it a
&gt; few times, then paid $100 for a 77,
&gt; $100 for a 69, $125 for a 78, $100 for 66, $350
&gt; for an 80, $400 for another 66,
&gt; $0 for a 73, $0 for a 71, and now I'm
&gt; planning on paying $500 for a 72, which is the
&gt; most I'll throw down, knowing
&gt; I'll have to sink several hundred in parts
&gt; to get it rolling.
&gt; 
&gt; If you aren't willing to study the books, buy
&gt; the parts and fix it yourself, it
&gt; not economical to own a bus, and even when
&gt; you are willing to do all the repairs, the
&gt; economics are questionable, unless
&gt; you develop an eye for  a bus with potential.
&gt; I've had the best luck with the buses I've paid
&gt; the least for...!  I'd look on
&gt; the various bus classifieds on the internet,
&gt; and
&gt; wait for something affordable but not mint, and
&gt; in the meantime read the book!
