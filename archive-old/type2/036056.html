&gt; I dont see how letting gravity do the work would get the air bubbles
&gt; downhill and out the flow is just too low.

It would be very slow on a split bus with the master/reservoir as low as it
is. On a 68 to 73? it would work a little faster because the divorced
reservoir is a lot higher. 74? and up, when the divorced reservoir was moved
to the base of the drivers seat would be slow.... But it will still gravity
bleed.
Like holding a column of fluid in a straw with your finger over the top end.
Release your finger.....the fluid drains out.
By having the bleeder open, the fluid will drain out the bottom and the air
bubbles will rise. The bubbles will not flow downhill!
By pumping the pedal and bleeding, you are moving the bubbles towards the
bleeder. Same thing using a vacuum pump or a pressure bleeder.....
