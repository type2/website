Subject: Replace the Starter...And She still wont Start

Hello---

Well I just replaced the starter...double checked on the wires and all that 
good stuff..went to crank her over and absolutely nothing...The red oil light 
and Generator light comes on but when I turn over the key there is 
nothing..not even a clicking....I need to get my bus back on the road..any 
ideas where I should look...possibly ignition? Thanks for the help..Adam
