A friend just bought an '82 Vanagon.  Took it in to
get emissions test.  It
pegged the meter on HC in both low and high RPM, and
failed CO at idle.  I
am not sure where the adjustment screw is on the
AFM, am currently searching
the archives for that, and am not sure what could
cause such a massive rich
condition?  Ideas and hints?

I don't think ALL the 82 Vanagons had oxygen sensors,
but am reasonably certain that it was added right
about then. Look around for an oxygen sensor on the
exhaust - it well could be a major part of the
problem. Looking down from the top at the airflow
meter you see a large plastic cover and either a screw
in a &quot;well&quot; or a round plastic cover over said screw.
That is your only &quot;mixture&quot; adjuster. -BaH
