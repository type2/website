Subject: Ever live in your bus?

In the next year or so I'll need to do some extensive travelling and I'm
curious to hear from list members if anyone has spent an extended time living
out of their bus.  I would imagine this is easier to do in a Westy but I'd
like to know of your experiences in any bus.  How long did you live out of
your bus?  What camping equipment did you use?  What about showers and calls
of nature?  Anyone aware of any books published on this type of living
situation?  It may seem crazy to some but I'll bet there are some people out
there who have pulled this arrangement for longer than what most of us
expect.
