&gt; Well, I learned that the part of a motor or generator which accepts the charge

&gt; wrong all these years?  I don't think it is called a communicator.

It better be a commutator: otherwise you...won't have...the pow'r, cap'n!

The Communicator is the wrinkled, slick haired old device resembling
a horse's butt...
