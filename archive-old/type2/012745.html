I'm back on the list after being off for over two years. (I had nothing
to report or complain about until now.)
My vehicle an 83 Air-cooled Westfalia, 250,000 + miles.
Rebuilt complete engine 35,000 miles ago and it's been running fine ever
since.
Until NOW!!!
I'm trying to resolve a problem I've encountered recently and I don't
know where to start.
In short, I'm having a backfire through number 3 cylinder and the engine
just really runs funky.
The problem started after I filled up with gas (fuel probably had nothing
to do with the problem).
I thought the problem was bad fuel; I drained and replaced the fuel.
The trouble started about one thousand feet from the station; I just lost
power and managed to get into a safe place to park.
Previous to this event I had a strange sucking sound like a continuous
vacuum leak right in the area of number three cylinder. I replaced the
fuel injector hoses and both injector gaskets (base and little &quot;O&quot; type
seals. That seemed to fix the problem and I went about sixty miles before
the current problem came up.
When I try to start the engine it will catch hold and chug but sounds
like it's starving, it won't idle but with a little nursing it will build
RPM's but has no power. (All Fuel has been removed and new fuel added)
Strangely enough I revved the engine up and slipped the clutch enough to
get the vehicle moving and back home (eight blocks)
So far I've...
New points and condenser. The timing is set close enough to get the
engine started but not precise.
All four injectors working OK. Ohms check OK. Test light flickers
intensely on each injector test with the Air sensor disconnected from the
throttle body (not plugged in), not quite as bright when the Air sensor
is back in line and plugged in.
No injector leaks.
Airflow meter checks OK on specified terminals.
Fuel pump pressure OK, pump runs at proper times, on starting position
and when the Air Sensor detects airflow.
Fuel relief / pressure regulator operating OK.
Idle unloader valve checks OK on resistance, neon test light works
brightly.
Cold Start Valve checks OK on resistance, neon test light glows brightly
on test.
Tested spark plug wires with switching with other set (old) (resistance
not tested)
The double relay test has not been performed, but it's coming next.
Ground to double relay OK. 
All engine compartment ground leads are good and I added ground from body
to engine to be shure.
With the Air Sensor removed but still plugged in, the engine starts good
winds up to about 2000 RPM, that's about all you get out of the cold
start fuel supply. The engine has no knocks or noises and runs smooth at
the 2000 RPM. When I put the Air Sensor back in line the problem
continues.
I have to admit, I in-advertantly unplugged the brain with the battey
connected while testing general connections.
Can this blow or damage the control head???
I hate to be a parts replacer, I'd really like to evaluate and understand
this problem.
I'm also hesitant about buying a double relay for a hundred bucks if I
really don't need it. (I'd also like to find a cheaper source.)
I make a lot of 120 mile trips to go camping and fishing and often I'm 20
miles are more from any assistance, so I'm concerned about understanding
what I'm doing.
I'm probably not going to have any immediate response so tomorrow am I'm
going to put a tiny magnet on a length of rubber hose and run it down the
oil filler pipe and drag it around the bottom of the oil pan to see if I
have metal (a broken camshaft would leave a lot of metal)

Any assistance from any source would be appreciated.
