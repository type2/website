Hi everyone,

I just removed a perfecty running 1974 1.8 Liter 914 engine from my bus so
that I could install a rebuilt VW engine I just bought from AVP.   I'm
planning some long road trips this year (Yucatan Mexico) and I wanted to
start with a rebuilt engine.

The compression was good last time I ckecked (110,109,108,112 at 5,000 feet
above sea level) and good oil pressure.  The engine has always run really
good both for me and the PO.  I am selling the long block only, with
flywheel, clutch, oil pump, distributor, oil cooler and miscelaneous other
attachments.  How does $250 sound?
