Subject: Re: Removing type 4 engine, limited headroom

Yeah, I've pulled the engine without jacking the bus. You have to get the
engine down on the floor, or at least so that it's resting on the heat
exchangers on 3/4&quot; thick boards. Then you can push the bus forward, and
pull up about an inch to clear the breather.

I have thought seriously about removing the rear apron, welding some 16
gauge flanges on the outsides of the apron and on the insides of the
frame members at that point, to make the apron removable.

Conventional wisdom is that the apron became non-removable in 1972 when
VW went to the Type IV engine because of the extra weight. I don't think
that's right. I think the issue is the crush zone. The metal around the
bumper brackets is quite crushable (ask Peregrine and me how we know).
and the necessary reinforcement for a removable apron would interfere
with that. At this point, I'd as soon use up someone else's crush zone
and make it easy to pull the engine.
