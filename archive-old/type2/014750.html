One thing you need to be aware of in mounting the spare tire this way is
that the offset of the wheel is such that it will only mount on those tire
hangers one way. If you want to mount it with the hub cap out, you will have
to extend the bolts, or make a new mount. I am working on the new mount
because I am wanting to mount my tire hub cap out also. I happened to get a
mount from another listee that mounts to the bumper like a brush gaurd, but
is for the tire. I am going to extend the mount out to hold the tire the way
I want. This way the weight is held up by the bumper, not the nose sheet
metal. I will post some pics when its done.

Subject: [T2] spare tire mounting cosmetics


Hello listmembers....

So the cosmetics of my bus have recently gotten my attention and I have a 
few ideas.

One thing that sucked is over new years even someone decides they would dig 
the deepest grooves they could with a key on my rear door, granted I wasn't 
in the best area of town but geez.... This got me started on how things 
look, just so your up to speed.

I saw a bus some time ago with the spare tire mounted on the nose, nothing 
new. But he had it set up like a regular tire, with the little chrome hubcap

in the center. The rim was painted nicely the color of the bus as the rest 
had been.
My spare tire I don't think ever could hold the cap because of its 
shape/difference from the stock rims, but even if I had a extra stock 
rim/tire combo instead would those bolts coming from the tire mount stick 
out so far you couldn't get the centercap on, or if that going to be the 
easy solution - simply pick up a stock rim from a junk yard and use that for

my spare after I paint it to match my current rims?

Im guessing its more involved than this, but if anyone knows better??? that 
would make my day.

feeling in need of a new look,
Christopher

and one little extra question I just thought of because I always wondered 
about going back to the emblem instead of mounting the tire on the front - 
Are the places where the emblem clipped into probably missing now that I 
have holes to screw in the spare tire mount, or if I could sorta 'patch' 
things up a little could I still attach the emblem?
I probably won't do that ever, but ya never know. If I ever picked up the 
hightop Ive always wanted maybe ill try and switch back to more of a stock 
transporter look.

all done ranting......
my sunday pattern of thought.
&quot;how can I create more work for myself...., oh right the bus!&quot;
