&gt; Thanks, I may just do that. Meanwhile I am in need of a timing light...a 
&gt; purchase that will be made today. I asked the mechanic I took it to check the 
&gt; timing but like you said I know he's not trustworthy. I am sure however that 
&gt; he adjusted my valves.

first I don't know of any mechanic on the lower Western Shore (MD) that is
worth the price of air....about the only one in your area I would trust
with my VW is Peek Automotive in Seabrook and that is a good 20 miles from
your place..

&gt; First off I was totally oil leak free before he did it 
&gt; and now I have a small leak. (Great)

probably just used the old gasket, 1.59 part, think there is a FLAPS in
Crofton that has some VW parts and last I checked he did have the
gaskets.  He's right on 3 but can't remember his name, a non chain store
in the strip mall just up from Dunkin Dounuts.

&gt; I did as I was told and tightened up my cut off valve and choke and 
&gt; reconnected the cutoff valve to my distributor. It idles now although not too 

sorry I have FI now and my carb memory is real rusty

&gt; carb type with a foam filter. It hisses when I apply the throttle. Think this 
&gt; is normal?

it sort of sounds the sound those old foam filters made

&gt; oil filler neck that I assume were for the oil bath are both sitting open. I 
&gt; felt them and clearly feel air flow. Hhhmmnn. 

I have used heavy aluminum foil folded over a couple times and secured
with a hose clamp to seal off holes like that.

&gt; What's your thought?

today is just too nice to work on the VW,  go for a drive
