Courtney:

I haven't personally used, or know anyone who has used Corroseal.  Most VW and other car restorers I know will swear by POR-15 products.  It's a little different in that it doesn't chemically convert rust to some inert matter, but it forms an almost &quot;bullet-proof&quot; seal over the rust.  That saves a step, because with corroseal you'd still have to paint over it.
