&gt; Situation: 1970 bus with Mexi 1600DP.  I was running a 009 with 
&gt; CompuFire.  Finished a major tune-up last night, and the bus ran fine.  
&gt; This morning I tried to switch in an SVDA distributor.  Got it all 
&gt; hooked up fine.  Went to do a static timing before starting, and this 
&gt; is where I had trouble.  I usually listen for the little &quot;click&quot; rather 
&gt; than use a light, but I didn't hear it.  So I hooked up the light.  I'm 
&gt; getting 12v constant from the negative side of the coil.  That can't be 
&gt; right.  I disconnected the green wire from the SVDA and the main coil 
&gt; wire to the distributor; still 12v.

actually I think this is all correct. The two terminals 1 &amp; 15 are the
ends of one of the coils. If you connect something to the 1 side and
have power going to the 15 term then that closes the circuit and you
should see 12v. This is how the test light works with standard points.
rotating it to it just goes out is where the &quot;spark&quot; will occur.

What I would do is use the small notch in the upper ring of the
distributor body to set TDC for #1. then fire it up. From here you can
time it the correct way. Also when moving between an 009 and the SVDA
that aircooled_dot_net sells the direction the rotor points to when at
#1 tdc is 90 degrees off from each other.
