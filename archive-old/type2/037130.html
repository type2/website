Subject: Need '68 wiper arm

Anyone happen to have a '68 bus wiper arm they could part with?  This arm is
not the same as on the later years and is no longer available new.  The one
on my crew cab broke and I just don't have time to hit the junkyards right
now.  Would pay a reasonable price or trade for/toward a new part of similar
value that you may need.  It need not be pretty, just functional.

Thanks,
