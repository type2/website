Subject: removing nose section from parts bus

hello list.

sorry i couldn't make Ebus this year. this was the first one i missed
since the beginning of the event.

anywho, i was recently offered a good nose section from a parts bus
to repair the badly damaged nose on my new-to-me 77 Riviera.

what i really need to know is:
1) how difficult is it to remove this section? (the parts bus will
        still need to be in transportable condition after the surgery)
2) what tools will i need to do the job?
3) are there any articles, etc. out there that will help me?

please keep in mind i have never really done any type of
bodywork, so please explain so a 'beginner' can understand.

TIA,

Joel Wilson
