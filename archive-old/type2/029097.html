Well, it finally happened!  Last Saturday, Karen and I got to meet some of
the members of our illustrious list!  Dan from Renton (what is your last
name?) organized a gathering here in Seattle and Ken Madsen, Jody Drew and
Karen and I made it.  It was terrific!  Karen and I both felt like we were
meeting celebrities, and indeed we were!  They're all great people and I
look forward to our next gathering!

Dan, Ken, Karen and I did the Lewis and Clark thing (without Sacajeweia (?))
and finally found Bry's boneyard from Boeing.  Ken fell into a conversation
with the first guy he saw at Bry's (does he know everybody?) and then
everyone else.  Dan was soon pulling a Z-bed out of a vanagon for a very
fair lady in 'distress' he ambled across in the yard.  And Jody came by and
introduced herself to us all with an easy smile and a sledge hammer.  Soon
our Volksie crew descended on a wrecked bus in search of a fuel sender for
me.  It was a tough fight, but in the end, it was Dan with a twisted expanse
of steel pipe that 'negotiated' the tank out of it's cave.  Sadly the fuel
sender was toast, but I found another one that worked!

We headed out of Bry's none the worse for the wear and met Jody's longtime
canine companion, whose name I didn't catch.  Ken had to hurry off and
couldn't go to Alki beach with us for lunch, so we were down to 4!  Karen
was quickly elected as guide to Alki as she 'knew' the way, and we were off.

Alki was beautiful, (it wasn't raining if you can believe that!) and we had
fish and chips while sharing our 'first VW' story with each other.

I hope more of you can make it to the next one.  I can't wait!
