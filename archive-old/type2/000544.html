To my dismay I can't find the article, book or anything that talked about
this. Maybe I dreamed it in my sleep but it sure seems vivid to me. I can't
find Muir so I didn't check that reference. According to Bentley, temp II
should compensate the temp increase by enrichening the FA mixture which
should bring the temp down. What happens if the temp doesn't come down?

Shed some light on this part if anybody can. I may have just hung myself
here.

&gt;&gt; it's job and telling the FI unit to shut me down before I melt!

Tom Young Responded:

&gt;I've never heard of a &quot;too hot&quot; shutdown mode in the FI.  Is this correct?
