Subject: gas fumes in cab

I've just purchased a 79 Westy and amongst other problems, there's a strong
odour of gasoline inside the bus.  The heater is not working - I'm looking
into this next week - it seems like it's not firing (glow plug?).  Do you
think there's a connection between the two.  The fumes seem to be coming
from the heater vents, although it is switched off and the dash levers are
closed.

I hope this is not one of those endearing VW idiosyncrasies..., the wife is
not impressed.
