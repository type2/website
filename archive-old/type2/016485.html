        Oh, on the contrary -- I think the Vanagons are a very attractive design, they just don't have quite the same nostalgia appeal that buses do. Most people can't tell year differences in
buses, and they all just reek of &quot;60's&quot;. Vanagons have a bit more modern look, all their own, and still far more attractive -- to my eyes at least -- than any of the other minivans. Eurovans --
ugh!
      Besides that, for camping, the Vanagon Westy is far superior, just because of the extra space if nothing else. And a Synchro -- wow. I've lusted after one of those for years.
Vanagons just are quite old enough yet -- in a few more years they'll become a much hotter item.
