Subject: Turn signal switch

It figures. The day I go to get my bus inspected, my turn signal switch goes 
kaput. Until recently, it worked, but never clicked itself off. I had to 
manually turn the signal off after I turned. Saturday, the first turn I 
made, I went to turn the switch back to the off position, and the lever just 
went limp. I can still turn my brights on, but I can't turn either signal on 
and the lever flops around all over the place now.

What's goin on? Can I repair it, or am I going to need to replace it? If 
replacement is necessary, can anyone give me a ballpark figure on the price 
of a new assembly.

Thanks,
Jared
