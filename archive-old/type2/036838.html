&gt; Hello, just writing to let everyone know that we're getting ready to head
&gt; out on lag 2 of our journey.  My bus is holding up wonderfully, and almost
&gt; ready to hit the road again.  Kelly just got out of surgery yesterday, so
&gt; anyone may send her a get well soon message if they so desire.  She should
&gt; be okay for the trip, as I am folding the bed for her to sleep on on the
&gt; way.  Gas is $1.56 for regular unleaded here.  I heard it's $2.59 in CA.  To
&gt; all Full Moon members:  Keep'em rolling!  Happy driving--Chet

I'd rather be poor and unknown.  If I were rich the gummint
would take the rest of my money.  If I was famous, everybody'd
be digging in my business.  You don't even know my dog's name.
