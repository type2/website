Subject: Re: [T2] need ign. switch set screw

&lt;i need the teeny-tiny set screw that holds the electrical side of the
ignition switch in the housing.&gt;

I bought a bag of 3 a couple months ago from Lowe's Hardware. It was tiny, I think an M3 or something. Cost was about $1. Where are the remaining 2? WHO KNOWS....
