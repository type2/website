i think he means that the feet are made in such a way that they can attach to a flat or angled surface based on the fact that the &quot;foot' can be adjusted/moved/swivelled etc to match the angle of the surface..

typically i this this table would be middle 60's to middle 70's depending on wood grain on table, hardware, moulding etc... further detail on wood grain/ formica pattern and hardware would allow to more closely pinpoint the year/function of the table..
