Subject: Steering box seals?

Hello list. On my 78 westy the only oil leak I have is
from my steering box. Does anyone know of a source to
get new seals for a steering box? Mainly I need the
one for the peg shaft oil seal. In the bentley manual
Sec. 2, Page 31, Fig. 9-18, Item #20.

It's pretty bad that in a volkswagen that I don't
leave a oil mark in the back, but in the front.

Any info would be great, 
Thanks,
Shawn Reed
