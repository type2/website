Subject: Re: [T2] High Temp Powder Coating

Harry,

You can see a different color of hi-temp here.

http://www.shockwaverider_dot_com/newbus/picture-005.html

The heater box and heat dump tube were done with their hi-temp 
coating...still looks great.

A bag?

You do have a powder coat gun, right?

Remember that it has to fit in an oven and that you can *NOT* use your
regular kitchen oven.

Otherwise, you need a radiant(infrared) heater like the ones here...

Might be easier to send it out for hot jet coating...one of the list 
members does that for a living.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; So I'm wondering if anyone has experience with high temp. powder coating?
&gt; 
&gt; Here's a URL:
&gt; http://www.eastwoodco_dot_com/shopping/product/detailmain.jsp?itemID=91&amp;itemType=PRODUCT&amp;iMainCat=710&amp;iSubCat=717&amp;iProductID=91
&gt; 
&gt; I'm thinking about buying a bag to do the exhaust system with but it's 
&gt; fairly expensive so I'm hoping to see if anyone has dealt with it before 
&gt; I do.
&gt; 
&gt; TIA,
&gt; Harry
