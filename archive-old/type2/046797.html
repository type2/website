this week I find myself in Virgina for a wedding.
I'm going to visit a high school pal in South Carolina 
after that and I am thinking maybe there might be a junkyard
out here that might have a new exhaust system for my 77?

also, my starter has stopped working without being wacked with a hammer
I assume this is a solenoid thing? It's fairly newish, only 7 months old
and it just started doing it in Montana last month, when it was hot.
Now it's permascrewed. See if it's has a warranty I guess?

Finally, my head temp sensor keeps falling out. I just have
it bypassed right now, but it makes it even harder to start..
Will bypassing this cause other problems?

thanks all



matt
