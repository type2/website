Subject: new bearings - heating up
Message-Id: &lt;v0311070ab4250625e943_at_[209.214.197.194]&gt;

Hello all,
I have recently installed new rear wheel bearings in my 77 Bus. Today I took
it on the road for the first time. Out of curiosity, after 20 miles I felt
the hubs. They were warm on the outside and hot to the touch on the inside.
The outer CV joints were also very hot. The inner bearings were Chinese and
seemed to be sealed and packed. Could I have made the rookie mistake of not
greasing the inner bearings? They operated very smoothly and didn't make a
sound. I would've had to pry the (teflon?) seal out to look inside/pack
them. I just assumed they were packed! I will call RMMW tomorrow and
hopefully they will have an answer. Anyone else ever noticed a breakin
period for bearings when they get hot?
