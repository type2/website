Subject: 73 automatic distributor #
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hello list,

I would like to  ask a question at the risk of getting
my head bit off. I never realized how many different
distributors that VW made. Can anyone tell me the VW
or Bosh part number for a distributor on a 73
automatic bus or tell me where I might find it? I
looked in my Bently manual and it had a list of
distributors with many, many different part numbers.
Can any one help me with this? The PO installed a
distributor that had no vaccuum advance on it.

I have been searching through the archives for an hour
and a half with no satisfaction. I just bought a box
of 8 old distributors and I don't know if any of them
are the one that I need. Any help would be most
appreciated. i know that this topic is an old one.

Thanks!
