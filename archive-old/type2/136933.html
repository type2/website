Subject: Re: [T2] Distributor rebuilder???

Perhaps it was a server problem with Philbin- I tried this morning, and
got an error, but they're back up now. They stock several of the
Air-cooled VW distributors for $101. CIP1 has the new Mexican OEM
distributors for $99, which I have heard are basically the same model as
the Aircooled_dot_net SVDAs going for $139, although the ACns are recurved
somehow. Anybody got more info on that? Which would be the best one to go
with? I don't mind spending money to get the best one, but I want to make
sure it really *is* the best one.
thanks,

&gt;&gt; They are not dead:
