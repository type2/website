Subject: [T2] transmission mount

HI,

We've been getting some &quot;clunking&quot; from the transmission when shifting, and
the motor &quot;surges&quot; when we step on the clutch to shift, or stop.

How much movement should there be in the transmission?
When I crawled under and had my wife shift gears and start to let the clutch
out, the nose of the tranny moved an inch.

But I couldn't find anything loose to tighten.  All the bolts were tight.

Is this amount of play normal, or excessive?

What else could cause the clunking, and surging?
