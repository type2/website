Subject: EGR

Anybody up for another round of EGR?  My rebuilt stock '77 2.0L FI is slowly
getting its accessories bolted back on, and I have to make a decision about
EGR.  I have all the parts, and have cleaned out all the appropriate tubes
and the EGR valve itself, however:   I DO NOT want to have to buy EGR
filters and disassemble the contraption for cleaning semi-annually.  I was
thinking of installing everything, but blocking it off before the filter.  I
plan to get the mixture adjusted by a shop after I install and tune the
engine.

My problem is that I live in a large western state which requires biannual
smog checks for vehicles 1974 and later. I expect I will have to unblock the
EGR system every two years to get smogged.  Here's my dilema:

A) If I get the mixture adjusted for daily driving with the EGR stuff
blocked, it would run rich when I unblocked it for the smog check.

B) If I get the mixture adjusted for the smog test, it would then run too
lean after the smog was done and I block off EGR again for daily use.

Does anybody have any idea if:

Plan A) would be too rich to pass smog?

Plan B) would be lean enough to harm the engine?



This should be interesting...

Thanks,
