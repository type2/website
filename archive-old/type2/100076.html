&gt; The plugs are there for a reason, too!  Those pans are located right
&gt; behind the rear wheels.  When water comes in thru the top (unless you are

&gt; day or two, all is well.  The water that the rear tires is kicking up is a
&gt; different kettle of salt cod! It is contaminated with dirt, rocks, salt,
&gt; and other unmentionable substances.  It should *not* be allowed into your
&gt; battery tray!  and that is why the plugs are there.  They block water from
&gt; below but do not seal the opening.  Water does drip out, slowly.  I would
&gt; leave them in.

When my engine was out I cleaned up my trays.  Before I repainted them I
poured in some acid and neutralized it with baking soda and then used a wire
brush to remove the loose rust and flakes.  This was the result:

Plug or no plug the trays aren't perfectly flat and sometimes water can't
get to the hole to drain out so there's no easy solution.

The trays are obviously a poor design and I can see arguments for an against
the plug but I think I agree with the archive posts.  The problem I have
with the plug is that I believe it promotes rust around the hole so you have
to be diligent with it or the hole will grow and then no plug will fit in
it.

David's solution sounds like the right idea: favor fast drainage.
