Hi Volks,
   Since we have owned our present bus, a 1971 westy, the little red brake 
light on the dash hasn't worked.  It doesn't light when I push to test it 
and it didn't come on when I had a recent brake preasure switch failure.  I 
believe the bulb is bad as the rest of the wiring seems to check out OK.  My 
question is, how do I get into that light fixture to replace the bulb?
   Thanks in advance, and have a great weekend!
