Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Filter cross reference chart?

VW OEM # 021 115 351 A =
Wix 51521 (Was 51319 many years ago)
Fram PH2844
(Note: Wix Interchange says this is a 51410 which further states it fits a
variety of vehicles &amp; tractors, but not one mention of VW. I have never used
the 51410)
Mann/Mahle W920/17
Bosch 72137
AC Delco PF13
(Note: Wix Interchange says this is a 51068 which is the &quot;short&quot; Ford Oil
Filter and/or 51085 which is the &quot;short&quot; Chrysler Oil Filter, both of which
I have used with no problems)
Amsoil SDF42
Hastings LF142, LF304
Purolator has a bunch: PER17, PER17M, PER18, PER4670
Motorcraft has a bunch as well: FL5, FL200, FL259, FL264, FL293, FL787
 All above are the &quot;stock&quot; (aka short) length. I have used the long filter
in the past (VW or Wix):
 VW 068 115 561 =
Wix 51515
Wix 51452
Fram PH8A
Fram HP1
AC Delco PF2
Amsoil SDF15
Hastings LF115, LF344
Motorcraft FL1, FL1A
Purolator PER1, PER1A, PER119, PER316

&gt; Does anyone have a crossref list of all the oil filters that will fit on
&gt; our type2 Bays? In a pinch any of them would be better than nothing.
&gt; Thanks,
