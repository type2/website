&gt;For those few perverts who want the worst, you take a
&gt;piece of window screen and dab some bondo around the
&gt;edges, now you reach under the fender and slap it over the
&gt;hole . . now you start troweling on the bondo on the outside
&gt;till you got'er about the shape you want . .  :-)

West--I believe you must have been the body man who worked on that 65 in my
back yard. I think it grew up in Mississippi somewhere. Love the way you
used the wadded newspaper for bulk inside the rocker. And latex enamel
really does have the best price/value ratio, plus e-z cleanup. =^ )
