Since we just spend bandwidth on paranoia, how 'bout a little
on being compulsive.

I'm rebuilding the 40 horse for my totally original, totally 
neglected '64 Standard. This is the engine that came
with the bus from the factory: numbers match. I'm doing a 
totally stock rebuild, though I *am* putting in cam bearings
and having Gene Berg's shop balance it (please don't tell).

As I start to think about the details, there is alot I do not know.
For example, what decals belong on the engine? Where are they placed?
Are the wire bails that hold on the valve covers painted or plain? 
You get the idea...

What is a good source for this information? I see various books in the
mail order catalogs that suggest they would answer my questions, but
which one is best? Are there other sources? What do you folks think?
(Other than this is a crazy exercise; I already know that.)

Thanks,

Tom F.
