Subject: Re: [T2] Possible to elimate the power brake servo?

I was fixing a friend 1970 Westy about a month ago, his bus has dual 
cylinder drums brake at front, after I did the hole brake system, new 
cylinders, pads and fluid the 70 stops better and most relevent for this 
discusion easyer than my 77 european Westy with disk in the front and no 
booster anywhere.
Yes you can stop the bus without the booster but requires a lot of effort (I 
do everyday), by the way is to much complicated to add the booster to my no 
booster system ?
Finaly I would like to share with you all, that this past weekend I was 
using my brother 2002 Ford Explorer, and after almost 200 miles I found that 
if I have to drive around 65 mph I definitly rather drive my bus (1600 DP T1 
engine stock, Konig shoks in the four corners and Goodyear Wangler RTS 
tires) than his infamous SUV.
Yes my bus is by far slower that my brother4s explorer but mine is a lot and 
I mean a lot softer in any way when you drive it, just 200 mile in my 
broter4s and I start feel my theeft a little bit loose not to mention how 
cool the buses are.
