Subject: Shifting ... bad engineering?

Hello all,

I've been having a reoccuring problem with my bus.  Luckily it's one that 
I've been able to fix.  But this has lead me to ask the question ... 
couldn't Volkswagen have done this better?  You see, the problem I've been 
having is thus:

The connection between the rod (I believe it's called the hockey stick?) and 
the transmission under the bus at the FRONT of the Transmission ... is held 
together by one small screw.  The screw goes through a rubber and metal 
U-shaped coupling and into a *shallow* indentation in the rod coming out of 
the tranmission (called the nose cone?).  Well, if you still follow me, this 
screw disappeared, and thus I could not shift.

I found and fitted a surrograte screw for now, but ... isn't this connection 
a little poorly thought out?  Isn't there a better way to do this?  The 
screw I've fitted in there has already come out once ... and I guess it'll 
just be one of those things I have to fix once in a while.

Has anyone else had this problem and thought of how to make this connection 
better?  Corrections on my terminology are also appreciated.

Peace,
- Ian
