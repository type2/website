Speaking of self contained...What have some of us done to make unsceduled
pitstops (or in the words of click and clack the tappet brothers &quot;getting a
wicked haircut&quot;) more convenient.  This topic may be a bit too graphic for the
sensitive.  One of my best accessories  was a large mouth plastic olive jar from
restaurants of about a gallon capacity.  The six gallon model makes a great
water reservoir.  For Number Two, a plastic liner in a small trash can works jes
fine...
