Subject: Swing Lever Bushing Lifespan?

	Greetings Wise &amp; Esteemed List

	I've been lurking in digest mode forever and a day, and now have a
real question to pose to all with respect to a '72 Westy Weekender.  Around
41K miles back, I replaced the swing lever bushings with a kit supplied by
my VW FLAPS - was marked &quot;Febi/Bilstein&quot; and came with all the &quot;right&quot; swag.
I grease those puppies regularly, probably once a month or every other
month, mostly street driving to and from work.  Also greased before and
after any serious road trips.

	About a month ago, and after driving the girlfriend's '73 Deluxe, I
realized something was amiss with the steering - sure enough, there is now
some vertical play in the swing lever end connected to the tie rods and the
steering is most definitely &quot;vague&quot; during left/right transitions,
particularly so at about 45 degrees each side off-center steer.  BTW, the
ball joints, drag link, and tie rods have all been replaced at one time or
another, and presently check out OK, as does the steering box rubber
doughnut.  The steering box itself is OE, adjusted and freshened up with new
gear oil after a rebuilt box failed inside of one week while on duty.

	40K seems a bit low on the lifespan for the bushings - what do the
the front end gurus have to say?  I was under the impression that this one
one of those things that you replaced, kept greased and expected 100K or ten
years driving before replacement.

	TIA

	Jim Hayden
