&gt;&gt;Questions for the gurus--I want to make the best of this--would it run
&gt;&gt;cooler with:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;         a)  lower compression ratio (maybe 7.2:1 ?)
&gt;&gt;         b)  better airflow from dual carbs or larger valves
&gt;&gt;         c)  vacuum advance distributor (less advance at part throttle?)
&gt;&gt;         d)  all of the above
&gt;&gt;         e)  none of the above
&gt;&gt;         f)  see you on the side of the road, pal
&gt;
Type 4 cooler.

That will help.
You know whats annoying though? Throughout all the engines I've seen built 
and bigger gives you more thoery, is that they get hotter. And the exhaust 
is hot too. If they were really efficient, the exhaust would be cool, and 
the engine would be too. (Remember heat is waste that could be making you 
go.....) Sad isnt it?
