John, Sir, Old buddy, amigo,

I count 4.

My wife just let me have my third (actually, she has joined in on the
cleanup...wow).
But, I showed her a picture of a Type 1 (convertible, good engine, good top,
bad interior).
Ready to trailer home to Texas....

She asked me if I could spell DIVORCE. (I said no.)

*grin*    Would somebody please tell me why these things are so addictive?
Please?

72 Baywindow with tons of chromium and working A/C (that's what got my
wife....!!!!) - The IceBox

notice
&gt; the rust or the faded paint... That's also some of the memories, the
&gt; understanding wife.&lt;&lt;
&gt;
&gt; Ah yes, speaking of the understanding wife:  I currently own 3 running
ACVW's.  66 Camper, 73 Westy, and 71 Super Beetle.  I got the 73 Westy on
the premise that it was a great price and I would throw on a paint job and
double my money upon selling it.  Thing is, it's a great bus and I want to
keep it, so how do I explain the air-cooled phenomenon to my wife when she
asks, and i quote, &quot;Why do you need three??&quot;  I'm sure we all here can
understand why I would want one split window, one bay window, and one Type
1. Really, I guess it's a good question, why do I need three?? It seems
obvious to me, but How do I explain it?? Anybody else been in this
situation?!?!?!?
