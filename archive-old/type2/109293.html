Subject: Re: [T2] I'm gonna pull my engine

From: &lt;ARoman4047_at_aol_dot_com&gt;
&gt; '71 and back type 2; type 1 engine...
&gt; '72 and up type 2; type 4 engine...
&gt; 'Course this is US spec...European type 2's would still have type 1
&gt; All of the above is general...And over the course of 30 years or so
&gt; anything short of a Merlin 'might' be back there... ;-)

Yup, G is a `77.  But typically the engine is not the original.  It's still
a pancake, with a single Weber (I know, I know).

I'm going to rig the driveway for the pull, and work out how to safely drop
it on my own.  The trick may be my figuring out which specific seal to get,
though it will simplify replacing the plugs, wires &amp; other general tune-up
bits...
