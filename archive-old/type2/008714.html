RE: clik-type torque wrench.  The way you use it affect the torque also.
While checking all my &amp; my friend's torque wrenches with a torque
transducer and electronic measuring equipment I noticed that if you apply
the torque quickly you will get an inaccurate reading - torque overshoot.
 So just like you have to with a pointer style gage - apply torque
smoothly and at moderate speed.  I have used both - I really like the
clik type for torques over, say 45Nm, because at higher torques it is
real hard to slowly move that pointer up to the correct line.  For this
reason, the clik type is probably more accurate for higher torque values,
unless you are stronger than me, which is likely.  Just my opinion.
