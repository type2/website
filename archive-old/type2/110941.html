&gt; list,
&gt; what is the best product to use when glueing the valve cover gaskets to

&gt;  so please enlighten me.

Hylomar, available on the Permatex rack at your local flaps.

Put a thin film of this on one side of a new cork gasket, put gasket on a
clean, smooth valve cover, then install the whole works on a
squeaky-clean head surface (no sealant between the head and gasket).
Wiggle the cover around a bit to make sure that it is seated well, then
pull the spring bail up.  Wiggle the cover a bit  more to make sure that
everything is seated (if it doesn't move, don't worry)!

Did I mention that the gasket surfaces need to be clean?

The nice thing about Hylomar is that it doesn't harden, so the next time
you need to remove the valve cover it will wipe off relatively easily
compared to weatherstrip adhesive, Fel-Pro glue, etc.  Being easy to clean
encourages the mechanic to do a good job rather than just slathering on
more sealant and hoping.

Every once in a while I'll get a leaker, usually because of hasty work on
my part.  Sometimes I just get a bad gasket.
