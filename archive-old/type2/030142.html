&gt; Listees...

&gt;     So today I went to my first VW show and it was excellent!!  I did notice 
&gt; one thing that I'd like the group to comment on.  (I hope I'm not out of line 
&gt; here.)
&gt; 
&gt; I don't mean to offend anyone and I know I'm generalizing here, but is it 
&gt; just me, or do certain types of people gravitate to either breadloafs or 
&gt; splits...
&gt; 90% of the daily driver splits I saw, were driven by hippie types, where as 
&gt; older, more settled people drove bays...

Hey, I may be &quot;older&quot;, but I'm definitely not &quot;more settled&quot;!

I think that the majority of buses currently going on road trips are
vanagons and Bays.  I just spent 400 miles on the road this weekend in
SoCal and saw six bays, and zero splits.  The splits seem to go to bus
events, but the bays go everywhere!
