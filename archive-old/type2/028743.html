&gt; Just wondering if one of these coolers will keep beer cold if I
&gt; put the beer in cold?


The Koolatron (or comparable models from other manufacturers) will reduce
interior temperature by 20-30 degrees below ambient temperature, making it a
decent &quot;fridge&quot; for items that are already cold when first put in (such as
beer). It is typically not sufficiently cold to chill items that are not
already cold. On the other hand, if you augment it with ice, the ice can
stay frozen for days. When I had my '77 Westy, I took the &quot;guts&quot; from a
Koolatron and mounted them into the lid of my stock Westy icebox.  While it
didn't match the performance of a real fridge, I was satisfied with the
results for the low cost. I did not run into a situation where it killed the
battery, but I did have a separate deep-cycle battery devoted exclusively to
it (and my stereo) so it had a lot of juice to work with.
