&gt;          That's one of the things I don't understand
&gt; about the archives --
&gt; why is there any delay at all in archiving???  

This always got to me when I first got my bus (and
joined the list), but I found it is much easier to get
recent posts from the egroups archive (
http://www.egroups_dot_com/group/type2/ ) . I goto this as
often as to the &quot;Archive&quot; ( http://vw.i405_dot_com/ ). You
get recent posts, that go back to June of '98. Steve
G. (who I think is on vacation) can better explain how
the vw.i405 archive works. 

Also see http://www.egroups_dot_com/group/type2/info.html
and scroll down to the bottom of the page. Here you
can get  &quot;Top Threads, Top URLs, Top posting authors&quot;
for recent posts.

2.0l will run once you do a tune-up, replace the
vacumme hose, fuel lines, etc.. etc..
