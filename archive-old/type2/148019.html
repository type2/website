Subject: Re: [T2] Welding

Price depends on alot of diff variables. I have had welding done for $25 (similar size). 

I have also had mufflers installed with a custom tailpipe bent for $25... Place, time, mood of the welder... 

I got so tired enough looking for a place that could do the work when I needed it done that I learned to weld. It's just one of those skills that pays for itself time and again - much like a good utility trailer or good tool. 

Look at the Lincoln SP-175+ When I've got the cash I'll have one...
