Subject: Re: paint codes 68-79

Where do I find this code?  My bus was a chartreuse (sp) yellow, but is
now a black and white combo.  Just curious.  There seems to be three
colors on the list of codes that could be my original color.  Is there
some place to read it in the VIN?  BTW, I drive a '74 Westy.
