Greetings....

I am having the delightful problem of a constantly loosening #1 plug.  Most
of the times I can hear it or I check it to see if it's loose, but the other
day, it was literally spit out.  I'm sure it was loose already.

What causes this?  Was the plug overtorqued at some point?  It still seems
puzzling that a plug could actually unscrew itself from the head.  And there
really doesn't appear to be a tremendous vibration in my engine to cause
this?

Any thoughts on why this happens and possible fixes?

Cheers,

Tom
