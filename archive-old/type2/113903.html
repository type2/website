Well, I did respond with my experience, I guess it wasn't conclusive.  :-/  I'll try again.

&gt;74 Bus with 2L engine. I am replacing the original 002 transmission
&gt;with a later (76 on) 091 transmission.

My opinion is that you should not do this because of the extra length of the 091 tranny.

&gt; I am planning to keep the old
&gt;flywheel with 215 mm clutch and the 74 bell housing and starter. Which
&gt;input shaft do I need to use - the shorter old 002 one or the later long
&gt;091 one? Or can I use either one?

I have used the 091 tranny with 091 input shaft with '74 bell housing, starter, 215mm clutch and 2-liter engine, just like you are planning on doing and I had no problems with the input shaft length.  I did however end up going back to an 002 trans because of the tranny length issue.
