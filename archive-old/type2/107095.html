Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel gauge calibration

Jasan

did you make sure the sender float arm was bent properly?,, 

If the float is hitting the top of the tank before the electric wiper arm is
reaching the top of the resistor, your sender needs to be &quot;calibrated&quot;,, not
your gauge

&gt; I just recently replaced my fuel gauge sender. Since then when I fill the tank
&gt; the needle on the gauge only goes to about three quarters full. With the old
&gt; sender the needle would go to full but then drop to empty at half full and no
&gt; longer register. Could this new sender be faulty or is there a way to
&gt; calibrate the fuel gauge? I know on the earlier bays there was a screw on the
&gt; back of the gauge to calibrate it. Can anyone confirm that this screw is on my
&gt; 78 before I have to take apart the instrument panel?
