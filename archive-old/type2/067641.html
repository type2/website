&gt;Hi, folks. I'm new to this list, having recently purchased a 72 Bus. Got to
&gt;know it better by driving it from San Francisco to Dallas (its new home).
&gt;What a wonderful vehicle! It's in beautiful shape, all original (except for
&gt;slightly modified engine). Very little work needs to be done.
&gt;
&gt;Here's one thing that needs to be done. The horn, when plugged in, won't
&gt;stop blaring. After spending some time chasing this down, I've determined
&gt;the wire that runs down the steering column is the culprit. Now here's the
&gt;question: The wire goes down the middle of the steering column at the top.
&gt;However, I see no wire come out down at the bottom, at least through the
&gt;steering column. I do, however, see a wire on a spade connector come off
&gt;the bottom of the steering column tube (outer tube). This is shown in the
&gt;various manuals as being correct. My question is, where does the wire come
&gt;out from the center of the steering column shaft and start going through
&gt;the steering column tube? I want to replace this wire, but this is not
&gt;looking like a straightforward proposition. Can anyone &quot;steer me right&quot;?
&gt;

ADDED question...   My poor lil' 71 has a habit of giving a cute
little/tiny &quot;beep&quot; whenever I go over a bump.

It's only cute because it's so SOFT a noise.  But I have a feeling that
in time, a guy is going to get upset, and I will be shot to death for
&quot;beeping&quot; at the wrong moment - I live in L.A.   

Those who have weird (wired) beep noises may be able to help.

Thanks, Mucho Thanks,

John A.
