Subject: Re: [T2] FS in So.Cal

the 73 hi roof adventurewagen has a blown engine and i'm in negotiations
with the gentleman to buy it at this time which is why i asked about
putting my engine in an automatic bus this morning.  overall decent
condition, red and white owned and camped it for 20 years and then he gives
it to his teenage son who promptly blows the engine by overheating but the
son has a new 68 mustang which seems to be more his style anyway.  you
should have seen the look on the dad's face when he told me that he had
taken out the bed to put a speaker box in.  it is hard to describe but i
read it as &quot;can't believe a 17yo boy would rather have big speakers than a
protable love nest&quot;  i really had to hold in my laughter on that one.
anyway, the interior is all there except for a small table that goes on the
dash by the passenger.

 i'll be parting out my 72 westy/adventurwagen topped bus if i get this one
so be prepared for decent deals in so cal at my house.  i have most all the
westy bits, lots of glass an original wood headliner, good tranny and many
other bits i'll offer up here first before they get ebayed.  i'm basically
wanting to transplant my powerplant and my home made doorpanels and such
onto the adventurwagen to save me the cost of restoring what i already have
but if i miss out on this one then i'll be back to my original plan.

 the wife isn't sure if she likes the adventuragen bed yet as she thinks it
looks cheap but from what i've heard is that they were the most comfortable
of any conversion.  anyone back up that statement on their comfort as if it
isn't the most comfortable i'll probably keep my westy bed and make new
wider boards for it and have a twin sized bed back there instead which is
cool in it's own right.
