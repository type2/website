Subject: T1 muffler: stockish SS versus stock German

This is meant to be a product review of the SS muffler that Bus Depot sells
(PN 211 251 053ES) and a general comparison to a stock German unit
(Leistritz).  The motor it is mounted to is a stock DP 1600cc with stock
heater boxes and destined for a '71 single cab.

Bus Depot basically sells a stock complete setup for the same price as the
SS kit for ~$100.  It is up to you which would better serve your needs.
There seems to be German (211 251 051EK and 211 251 053EC) for the same
price as well.  I do not think Bus Depot carries a Mexi/Brazil unit at all,
which is good!

General Overview:
First off the SS unit looks beautiful and is really well made overall.  The
kit came with a one piece exit tube as opposed to the two piece stock style.
Also a hardware kit is provided in this kit.  So one should be able to order
this kit and have everything needed to install it completely.

Time to mount it:  
The muffler body slid into place quite well on the head bolts and lower heat
exchanger tubes.  Next I tried to connect the DP manifold heat risers to the
muffler... Big trouble, one side (passenger) fit together after mild cursing
a coercing, but the other side was impossible to get aligned at all.  I have
done many a muffler in my day and normally you can at least get one bolt per
side of the manifold in a worst case scenario (normally on performance
headers).  A stock muffler normally lines up without any issues with the
heat risers.  I ended up just wiring the bolt holes closed the best I could,
which should be okay but probably will still have a slight leak. 

The hardware kit provided came with quality materials and was easy to use
and fit nicely....  But did not have any hardware to mount the exit pipe!
So you will need to have an extra muffler clamp handy and nuts/bolts to
mount the pipe support flange onto the muffler body.  Not a complete
hardware kit from the way I see it.  Ron Salmon from Bus Depot told me that
the new kits now have the extra clamp and hardware included after a customer
pointed this out to him, so this should be a non-issue for new sales. 

The last step is to install the fresh air tubes... This proved to be easier
said than done sense the 2&quot; metal pipes that go into the muffler would not
fit at all.  I have seen this many times on &quot;performance&quot; headers and such.
The trick is to cut slashes in the pipes and flare them inwards to fit in
the holes.  So you can work around this issue but it is not a perfect
&quot;drop-in&quot; fit either.  In comparison the stock German muffler is designed to
fit the metal pipes with ease and a little tap with a rubber mallet sets
them right in with a little compression fit.        

The rear hanger bar fit nicely and there was no rubbing with the muffler or
anything like that, just like stock.  I suppose this could be an issue on
some forms of mufflers and headers with a 68-71 hanger..?

Summary:
The SS unit is well built in general, but fails in certain fit areas.  The
hardware kit is very nice in general, but lacks a few major parts to be
considered &quot;complete&quot; (which should now be corrected on new kits).  

If you have a bus that may not require heat risers this might be a good
solution for you.  The fresh air tubes can be made to fit, but requires some
work.

In general I would stick with the German kit with better fit and finish for
the same money.  Figure every 5 years or so when it rusts out you will need
to do some other maintenance anyway and do it all at once. :)

  
Hopefully this has been informative and will be helpful in choosing your
next stock setup muffler system.  If I am leaving out any points of interest
or I am unclear in certain areas please let me know and I can elaborate on
them.   This is no bash on Bus Depot either, as you can see they offer many
selections of mufflers to suit many peoples different needs for a reasonable
price and speedy delivery (YMMV).

Side Note:
For further interesting reading check out this months Car Craft and read
Matt King's editorial column about aftermarket stuff that just does not fit.
I got a kick out of it from dealing with so much EMPI junk that never fits
right!
