Subject: RE: [T2] Cleaning/painting Fan Shroud

I did the wire brush thing and it was a beautiful shiny thing to behold. I
didn't clear coat it and now, 3 years later it still looks nice and clean,
but it lost it's shine after a year, maybe less. It's just the natural
cosmetic oxidation. I guess if you found a temp resistant clear coat you
could get it to stay shiny.
