If you have any intention of driving this vehicle for any length of time, 
buy a new case. It's worth the money. Used cases are one of the reasons we 
so many posts like &quot;...I was cruising down the freeway when my motor blew 
up. Can't believe it, it only had 5,000 miles on it...&quot; To paraphrase Bob 
Hoover, unless you know the history of the case, and know that it has NEVER 
been overheated and stretched beyond its limits, you're better off buying 
new.

Howdy all. In my quest to make Joel's old crew cab a daily driver, I find
myself replacing the engine case, as the old one has one of the holes for 
the
cylinder/head studs all stripped out. Anyway, The best price I've found is
$400
for a new case, and $100 for a 40 over case. So, I figure that someone out
there has a much better price on a new case, or at least one that can be 
bored
to 20 over. Bear in mind that this is the 1600 Type I case, with special 
holes
in the rear of the case to allow the engine brace to bolt on. AS-21 
universal
cases also have this feature. Anyway, if anyone can help me, I'd certainly
appreciate any leads...
Thanks,
