&gt; PS - Forgive me for the second post, but another pertinent item is this 
&gt; state's social environment. One of our local big VW hobbyists (large 
&gt; workshop, several projects going at a time) is relocating to Missouri 
&gt; strictly based on his research of favorable political, tax, insurance, and 
&gt; economic climates of various locales across the country. He said he will be 
&gt; saving big money on gasoline, insurance, utility bills, and taxes among 
&gt; other things by moving.

Hello Guys   I wonder if this is the reason GEX moved to arkansas or if they 
just thought that was the next best place instead of a thrid world country  
later and have fun  Mark Dearing
