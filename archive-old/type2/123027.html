Subject: Aux air valve/ was when temp sensor II goes bad

I drained the tank this weekend after completeting all of the FI tests I
could without a pressure gauge ( will get one this week). I noticed some
rust in the filter and replaced it but it did not seem like enough to plug
the filter as I was able to drain the tank from the output end of the
filter. Tank had 5 gallons of good looking fuel. Anyway I was thinking
about the aux air valve and how long it should stay open. In doing the test
with my test ligh tit seemed to work okay but I was wondering how long when
cranking it shoud keep my test light on? It made the test light come on and
then the light got dim and went out after a few seconds. If my problem is
some how cold related how warm (head temp guage on #1, oil sump mounted
guage)  does my engine need to be to be warmed up?
