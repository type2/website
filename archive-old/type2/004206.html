Subject: Oil Leak - Appears to be caused by a little rubber connector

Ok, I'm still trying to solve my Bus's oil leak.

I took off the Rubber Bellows (connects the dipstick guide pipe into the
crankcase) and it does indeed have a small tear.

First, I'm finding it difficult to believe that my Bus relies on this little
rubber piece to hold oil.

Second, does anyone know where to buy there?

Third, can anyone see any potential problems of just buying a quality hose
and some hose clamps to connect the guide pipe and crankcase.

You can see the area I'm talking about in Bentley Manual; Chapter 5, Page
25, Figure 9-1, Part #12.

I really appreciate any and all help and assistance here.

One other thing, all oil was drained out of my motor and my wife tried to
start it a couple of times with no oil in it before wisely parking it and
calling for help.  Would that allow gas to get into oil lines?

Thanks,

Darrin K. Pierce
