&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm concidering a T2 for my family holidays.
&gt; I have 2 kids; 2,5 years old and 5 months old.
&gt; Can I safely transport my kids in a T2 camper ?

safety in any vehicle is relative, the older T2 is not equipped with the
latest safety devices.

&gt; There a no seatbelts in the back. Is there a solution for this ?

seat belts can be easily installed. it is not difficult, depending on the
year and model the mounting points may already be there
seat belts are always reccomended and are required by law in some
locations, especially for little ones
