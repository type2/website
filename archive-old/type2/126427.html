Subject: Single Vac Dizzy = Less Power?

Ok, I finally figured out why I couldn't get my 009 out... I wasn't
hitting it hard enough! Muir's book said something about using a pry
bar and hitting it with a hammer. That didn't even occur to me... So I
used my ball joint separator and a hammer and POP goes the dizzy!

Anyway, I put in a single vac dizzy I got from Karl. Engine at #1 TDC,
rotated the plug wires on the cap to match the new distributor (it was
one socket different), hooked up the vacuum can to the barrel of the
left carb, timed to whatever Bentley said for the 76+ engines (I
forget exactly what it was- 7.5 btdc? 5 atdc? I've been looking at
timing marks too much today...). Idles beautifully, tested the vacuum
advance by pulling the line and it immediately stalled. So the can's
working...

But it's got zero power! I tried retarding the timing thinking it was
advancing too far, nothing.

I came back inside to take a break and eat something before trying
again.. Here's the port I plugged the vacuum line into:

Should it be a different one perhaps?
