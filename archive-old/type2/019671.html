Subject: Reluctant owner of another bus, part 2

Got the bus home today, after lunch. While waiting for the tow dude to
show up, I scavenged some parts off of the other doomed VWs...

I have:

RF fender with headlight and turn signal from a later model squareback
Decent steering wheel from an early beetle, w/ horn arm
2 sets of pop-out windows for early beetle
2 sets of vent wing windows for early beetle
washer bottle for later model Ghia
washer bottle for flat windshield superbeetle
front bumper for 68-72 bus
4 different oilbath air cleaners
Underdash a/c stuff for Ghia
2nd pulley and pulley bolt for a/c compressor
crank sunroof for superbeetle

Anyone needs any of this stuff, please pmail me. I got dibs on one set
of beetle popouts.

As for the bus... Its a '73. Bodywise, it's ok. It has both bumpers, all
seats. Needs: windshield (cracked), tires, the part on the dash that
holds the steering column in place (and turn signal assy. and ignition
switch), front left window, engine tin, air cleaners, upper engine
access door, the bolt that holds the fan hub on... It is missing a few
minor things, but you'd have to have this much just to drive it. I
haven't had a chance to check the condition of the engine or carbs.

This is a project. I would rather sell it as a parts bus to someone who
can use it, rather than try to get it back on the road, but if you
really want a '73 and are pretty ambitious, it *could* be brought back
to life. You can do it, not me. I have enough stuff to do around here.
