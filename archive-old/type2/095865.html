Subject:  fuel line replacement a go!

 
&gt;The OEM size is 7mm but Karl swears by the 7.5mm.

Well, Karl's damn right, because there's no way in hell you'd get the 7mm hose and the correct style clamps over some of the places I battled to put new hose on last night (fuel injector nipple).

&gt;Square bosch filter right?

How 'bout square &quot;made in israel&quot; filter?

&gt; mercedes benz style fuel line clamps (10) need more?
&gt;Depends what you are replacing.  I count 18 in the engine &gt;comparment alone.

Lord, ain't it the truth, Get at least 25-30!

&gt; 7.5mm fuel line grommet thru fire wall
&gt;Wow!

Yeah baby.

&gt;fuel injection system cleaner (berrymans brand any thoughts?)
&gt;Berryman is a carb/parts cleaner.  Just put some Techron or STP &gt;into the tank next fill up.

This Berryman's is specifically labeled &quot;fuel injector cleaner&quot;

&gt; fuel injector seal kit (4)
&gt;Did you get the expensive Bosch ones?

No, I bought the off brand (didn't know) and they DO NOT FIT. It's not even close here guys, The big seal which hold the injector retaining ring to the intake runner allows the retaining ring to slide off. You have to get the Bosch.

&gt;The gas in going to come out under pressure on top of the engine so be sure it's stone cold and have lots of rags handy.  Wait for everything to evaporate (sniff sniff) before starting up the bus again.

Word up.

Thanks for your thoughts.
