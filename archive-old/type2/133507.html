&gt; &gt; check the libary on GEX    worse motors in the world
&gt; Okay, I've been lurking on this subject long enough! I bought a spare motor
&gt; from a friend some time ago. It's a GEX! It was in a bus that made it from
&gt;
&gt; Now that the motor in my 72 is on its last legs, it's about time to install
&gt; the GEX. But, just about this time, I join type2, and lo and behold,

the GEX might if your lucky last long enough for you to do a decent
rebuild on your current motor

&gt; everyone says it's no good! So what's the scoop? I checked the library as
&gt; suggested, but could find no article on GEX. What could go wrong? Poor
&gt; metals failing prematurely?

before I joined this list I foolishly bought a GEX motor, I sent em a
2liter core and they swore it was a 1700 and kept my core charge ($400)
 I even had the serial number but, oh well.e
engine arrived via truck freight, very poorly packed and slightly damaged.

engine was installed by myself and a well trained VW mechanic.  it leaked
from day 1 and GEX swore that it was just the break in period.  at 3,376
miles it siezed,  GEX wanted me to return it for &quot;inspection&quot;   I rather
paid a VW mechanic to inspect it.

the heat sensor mounted on the case was still showing the engine did not
overheat.

the engine was torn down and found to exceed tolerances at ALL measured
points,

one of the advertisments was that the engine gets &quot;All new pistons and
cyl&quot;  on teardown it was discovered that there were 2 VW pistons, 1 Cofax
piston and 1 Mahle piston,  considering VW had not made any pistons for
this engine in about 10 years it was interesting how they could have
possibly put a &quot;New set&quot; of pistons and cyl in the engine.

I never got any satisfaction from GEX, I finally sued in small claims
court over &quot;deceptive advertising&quot; and &quot;failure to provide the advertised
merchandise&quot;  I won completely but to this day have never collected even
1cent on the #2,500 judgement. and the BBB in the city where GEX refused
to put anything into their files on GEX.

want more info p-mail me for the Court Judgement # etc.
