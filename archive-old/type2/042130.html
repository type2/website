Hi,

&gt; &gt; Question Two:  How big is the tank on a '76 FI Westy?

&gt; Coasting in empty, the most I have put in my 77 is 14.7

 I've put 59 litres into my '77, once. That's 15.5 US gallons (13 imp).

 I'd done 263 miles since the previous fill. Next datapoints are:

	58.5	278 miles
   2x	58	241 miles, 237 miles

 I think of it as a 60 litre tank, though the manual says approximately 55.

 This is filling 'till you can see the petrol in the filler neck. Not too
clever, perhaps...

Cheers,
	  W.
