Subject: Fw: [T2] Timing marks on 69

The deepest notch should be to the left, it is TDC. You line it up with the
case halves. Set your timing at idle to one of the ones to the right, it
should be about 7 before.  Now measure 1 3/4&quot; around the pulley from the
deep TDC mark, and scratch a mark on the pulley. Mark it with whiteout. Set
the timing at full advance(about 3000rpm)  it should hit that mark, 28-30
BTDC. Watch it advance, it should be smooth, not too jerky.

HEY,

I have been trying to set my timing on my 69, the books show three marks.
Two
marks close together one further apart.

All of which I have. The books say the mark I should use is the one that
stands alone, but I do the timing seems way off.  I am using wrong marks?
Is the
possible the pulley is marked wrong.
