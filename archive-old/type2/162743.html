&gt; &gt; the collar is almost always ground and if the entire base is grounded and
&gt; &gt; you try to use positive to the collar it is very easy to get a short.  the

&gt; &gt;
&gt; Understood, Bob, but in this case, since it is suspended via the plastic
&gt; lens thru a rubber gasket, there is no (electrical) connection of the
&gt; fixture to the body at all.  I know that electrically it is immaterial which
&gt; is which and, as you say, custom would dictate that the collar be ground,
&gt; but....

right, was just saying it is very easy for that big collar to accidently
hit ground.

&gt; Think back to electrolytic derusting.  The part you want to remove the rust
&gt; from is made the anode (negative) .  If I made the steel negative, over time
&gt; it would be slightly self-derusting.  The down side is that the bronze would
&gt; become the cathode and would be self-corroding, but that bronze is pretty
&gt; corrosion resistant and will,  all things being equal, long outlast the
&gt; steel.

the flip side is the surface area in contact, the collar has a lot more
surface relatively than the tiny tip of the bronze contact

Probably doesn't matter very much in the short run, but we run these dern
things for the long run.
