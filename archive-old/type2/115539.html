Subject: misfiring and running rich

  Well, coming home on Easter, my bus started misfiring under load, and 
seemed to get progressively worse.  But at least she got me home.  
wheewwww!!!  Since, I have adjusted my valves, points, and timing.  When all 
is set where it is supposed to be, she seems to be running very rich.  My 
misfire is not as bad, but still there.  This is in a 1971 1600 DP with a 
solex 34.  I will admit I have an 009, and I have been looking to find a vac 
advance for cheap to no avail.  I followed Boston Bobs advice on tuning the 
009, and seemed to be having good luck, but in turning my idle screw, I find 
it makes very littlre difference, and when closed does nothing to the 
engine.  I am criging at the thought of bringing it to the shop with my tail 
between my legs.   Not to mention here in Vermont there are not too many who 
will service such things.
