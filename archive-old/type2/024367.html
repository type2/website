 No, No, and almost certainly, yes...  :-)

 All of the documentation on petrol (white gas etc.) fired stoves that
I've come across specifically warns against using them in any sort of
enclosed space. They are prone to &quot;flaring&quot; because they use the heat
of the flame to vapourise the fuel. If you have a spillage and cool the 
vapourisation tube the flame will flare up.
 I have been know to carry an MSR backpacking stove for emergencies,
but if
I had to use it I'd cook outdoors.

&gt; Yes, I know this subject is covered in the archives, but I'm confused
by
&gt; some transatlantic language problems...specifically when the term
'Gas' is
&gt; used does it mean 'Petrol (UK)/Gasoline (US)' or Butane perhaps, or
Propane
&gt; or something else like LPG or Methane or whatever...

 :-) Depends on the context. There is even more scope for confusion once
you start including multifuel backpacking stoves in the picture...

 The Devon &quot;cooker&quot; is neat- it's a two ring &amp; grill unit with the gas 
bottle underneath to make it self-contained. The mounting hardware 
includes a pivot to mount it behind the passanger seat so that it can 
swing out into the awning for use or be removed for extra space.
 I mention this beacuse it would be easy to add to a camper, being
self-contained, rather than built into a bigger unit or requiring a 
seperately mounted gas supply.

Cheers,
