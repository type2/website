Hi list! I thought I had everything fixed finally on my bus but last night I 
started the beast up and I had lost a quarter of a tank! I thought it was my 
sender unit acting up,  but I looked under the bus and there was a rather 
bad looking puddle. I smelled it and yep, gasoline! So I am trying to figure 
out before I tear things apart what could be causing this, any ideas??
