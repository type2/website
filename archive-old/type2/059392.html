&gt; Hey All,
&gt;
&gt;  My manuals haven't come in yet, and I was wondering what the best oil to use
&gt; is for my '71 bus. I live in Hawaii and the temp is usually between 60-90F.
&gt;

       I'd run straight Castrol 50wt or at least straight 40w.


&gt;  Also, are their any particular oil filter models that are/aren't good to use?
&gt;

          I've heard that Frams tend to disinigrate, but have no hard facts on
it.
