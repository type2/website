Subject: '71 Air Oil Bath Warm/Cool Flow Control Gizmo

Howdy, All.

This device in my air oil bath does not work; it has a bit missing on 
the exterior of the snout (right side) that connects it to the wax 
pellet gizmo. I think my bus would run a little better with this bit 
operating properly.

First things first: Does anyone have (or can someone please take) an 
image of what this -should- look like for me? Perhaps it will work if it 
is simply connected properly.

Second thing last: I have read the article in the library, but I am not 
convinced I want to deal with the situation that way if it turns out to 
be broken outright. I'd really rather fix it properly, with real parts. 
(giggle) Does anyone have a source for these? If not, I'd like to hear 
what others have done to deal with their warm/cool flow issues. (For 
temperature reference, I live in the CA Bay Area, so it is fairly mild 
here.)

Many Thanks,

tank
