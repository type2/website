Subject: Compression Ratio Setting

Hello all

I am in the process of doing my engine measurements on my 1700.  I did a
complete measurement for the compression ratio but had a few questions.

What is a &quot;balanced&quot; compression ratio?  differ by what amount.

Also in the Sermons Bob says to exactly match the head volume.  Mine
differ by as much as 1.5mL.  If the goal was a balanced compression
ration why is matching the head volume critical?  Reason being is I have
a .005&quot; deck heigh difference.  If I can swap pistons and rods and
cylinders (everything is new or reworked) to get things balanced why
should I care about exactly matched head volumes. 

Also is the only option for fixing the balance lowering the valve seat
or cutting meatal from the head?

Thanks
Brent
