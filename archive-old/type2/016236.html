Subject: Wanted - Heater Blower for Type 4 1.8 Liter Engine
Message-ID: &lt;350b4298.252c23aa_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Dear Volks,

I got a clean bill of health Monday from my mechanic on my new to me 1975 
Westy.  Only one thing is wrong.  The heater blower assembly that sits above 
the motor in the engine compartment is completely missing.  I don't need it 
yet in Texas, but it could be defroster weather in another month or so.

If anyone has one from a 1975 bus they are parting out or might know a 
source, please pmail me.  I'm new to Type 4's so I don't know if other years 
had the same blower.  Can someone tell me if there are other years that will 
also work.  This is not a catalog type item, and I haven't had any luck with 
the local salvage yards.  Also has anyone rigged up some kind of alternate 
solution?

Thanks in advance, David Hunt
