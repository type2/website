 I was wondering if anyone knew of a way to mount a motorcycle to the
front or rear of my bus. I appreciate any and all replies :)
thank you

Hey Himpster

Dude, depending on how big the bike is, a  small trailer just might be your
best option .!?  Something cute and solid, like a real small Jet Ski trailer.
Hanging something weighing something like 300+ lb. would put a serious strain
on the suspension, give ya a real sagging rear end or a nose heavy semi low
rider }8&gt;)  I would think {;&gt;!?

Have some tea and think through the possibilities.

Through true &quot;Busma&quot; you will find the answer..............
