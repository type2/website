&gt; The 69 westy I sold to Nikki had fixed vent windows.Always thought it was a
&gt; euro thing because as far as I could figure out it was a german delivery.

I think you're correct on that point, Chuck.

In Australia, the only Baywindow version that came out with opening vent 
windows, as far as I know, was the '76 deluxe ( as a result, most of us are 
trying to find the '76 opening vent windows for our other buses, I've been 
looking for a set for my '74 Campmobile since I got it, and I'll be soon after 
another set if I pick up the '72 crewcab I've been asking about ).

Even the VW specialty shops don't have any luck sourcing vent windows here, the 
guys I go to have tried ordering from the UK and everywhere else, without much 
luck.
