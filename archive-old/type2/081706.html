Subject: Re: [T2] no fire

From: &lt;ballantiner_at_uncw_dot_edu&gt;
&gt; Today my wife helped me install the 2 liter FI engine (donated by a friend)
into her 79 bay.  We hooked everything up and tried to start and it turned
over but there was no fire.  This engine ran before it was given to me, so I'm
thinking the coil is OK.  My feeling is that the coil isn't wired up
correctly.   The previous engine was a 1700 single carb installed by the PO,
so I have no idea how the FI wire setup is supposed to look.
&gt;
&gt; Right now there is a white wire connected to terminal 1 of the coil, it
joins the plastic sheething that holds the
&gt; wires that plug into the ECU.

The white wire to #1 is a single wire that comes all the way across the engine
from about 6&quot; from the ECU.

&gt; I think this wire is right according to Bentley.  There is also a green wire
&gt; connected to terminal 1 that goes to the distributor.
&gt;  As for terminal 15, I think this is where my problem is.
&gt; There's a black wire coming from the group of wires that hook into the
double relay (it has a big black inline
&gt; fuse), I hooked this to terminal 15 because according to the diagram in
Bentley, this is where it looked like it
&gt; should go.

Correct, it should go to an in-line fuse also, for the backup lights.
Now you should find the 3 wire harness that comes down from the heater blower
motor. It will have a dark blue with a tracer and it goes to the oil pressure
sender. It will have a black wire that goes to 15, it is key-on power. It will
have a white with green tracer and it goes to #1.

&gt;Also, in the Bentley diagram there appears to be another wire that should go
from terminal 1 to
&gt; the &quot;ignition control unit&quot; (is that the ignition switch?, or maybe it's the
one that goes to the dizzy?).

Only if you have a 79 Cal version with electronic ignition, but then the black
power wire for the control unit connects 4&quot; away from the double relay.

On a Fed version bus, you should have 5 wires going to the coil:
#15 = black from 3 wire harness, black to in-line fuse/ double relay
#1 = white w/green from 3 wire harness, green to distributor, white to right
side of bus [look for a LONG single wire with a grey sheath on it]

&gt; Anyway, if anyone could help me with this problem I (and my wife) would be
eternally grateful.
