Subject: Insurance info for 78 Bus

I know someone has the answer to this, or at least a tip on where I
should start!  My 1978 Baywindow was recently the proud recipient of a
much save-for pain job and looks fabulous.  Up till this point I had
only carried the minimum amount of insurance on it for liability; now
because it is looking good I would like to get additional insurance on
it just in case some ding-dong drives into me (or I into him!)  But is
it too old for the insurance company to do this?  I know of classic or
antique coverage but this bus is my daily transportation and I think
that has a milage limit on it.  Any advice?  Loved seeing you all at
EveryBus!   Beth and Prudence the 78 Bus
