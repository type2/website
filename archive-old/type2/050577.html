You might try to get VW pn 113 142 355 B at your VW dealer, it should be 
around $9 (us) and is listed for '77 and up baywindows. It is a small round 
rubber part with 6mm studs on both ends. Similar mounts are used in 
Porsches and are available from Porsche.

Hope it helps,

Brian

(The pn for earlier Busses is 211 261 325 C)
