+AD4-Took Bessie, the Grateful Dead VW 67 Bus to a Weekly Friday night

+AD4-cars

Just got back from the States and was amazed at the number of campers and
vans. Flagstaff, Sedona, San Diego all have at least 2 type 2's every block,
though some are a bit ratty.

Thing that got me though was I went to a cruise night at Redondo Beach, LA,
and although it was open to all cars pre 76, the small print said no VW's.
Still there were a few who came and parked outside the taped off area, and
the quality was easily as good as those inside.

What have the regular rodders got against VW?
