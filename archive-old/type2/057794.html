Subject: Tightening play in jalousie windows on westy?

Hey all,
First of all it is nice to see the list back up. Really missed reading
all your mail this past week. 

Wondering if anyone has a good method for tightening up the play in the
jalousie windows on a '77 westy.  I went to try and tighten them up but
found that everything seems to be riveted in place. They work fine but
there is at least a 1/2&quot; - 1&quot; of play in them.  It is great having the
bus running so well now that I can concentrate on the little things :)
Peace.
