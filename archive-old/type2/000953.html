&gt;&gt; Somehow all the emissions control parts were taken out of my '72 VW

&gt;the 72 had emissions control parts????


Yeah, what parts?  My 72 had a charcoal canister, now missing, but easily
replaceable from junkyards, and a PCV thingy up next to the dizzy.  This
would be harder to find in the yards, I think, but not that yard.  I mean
hard.  What else?  I don't think there was retard on the disparo back then,
nor EGR, nor a catalytic constrictor.

Maybe the asker should ask the inspectors what they think should be there
and act accordingly.

Regards,

Grant
