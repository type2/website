Subject: RE: [T2] shifter adjustment

Bill,

I know that we have crossed this path in the past. Yet, I have just
completed this job on a friends '78. The short hose from the tank to the
metal filler pipe is a 2 1/4 hose and has a slight bend. I used a straight
section of pipe from Napa, 2 1/4 in inside diameter, and cut it long so that
I was able to bend it. I would also recommend cutting the tank side of the
hose at an angle so as to not bunch it up on the rear side. All this done
with the engine in.

What is happening with the transmission?

Subject: [T2] shifter adjustment


    The bus is finally running and I took it for a drive tonight down
the road a little. I also put some gas in at the station. I replaced all
the bushing
and regreased my shifter,but can't seem to get it adjusted properly. Any
tips on this? I also had pulled the gas tank and replaced all the hoses
and fuel sender. The only hose I did not replace was the hose from the
tank to the filler pipe. As everyone knows it's not available. Mine did
look ok though. When I squished it I didn't see any cracks so I put it
back on. When I stick my nose near the right rear vent I can faintly
smell gas. I think! I hope the hose didn't fall apart when it got gas on
it. I am hoping the smell is from the paint on new parts burning off.
I&quot;ll keep
my fingers crossed. I want to know when one of the vendors is going to
reproduce it.I tried the Napa hose and it didn't work and I tried to
find something at a Marina with no luck. Oh well. I'll hope for the best.
