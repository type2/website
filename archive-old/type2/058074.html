I really enjoy this...

 ATDC     TDC     BTDC
                     |

Or, let's say it this way...
12:00 on a clock is TDC.  3:00 would be 45 degrees BTDC, and 9:00 would be
45 degrees ATDC.  OR, if you like, 12:01 - 6:00 = BTDC and 6:01 - 11:59 =
ATDC.  If you look
at the diagrams in Muir, it makes better sense.  This really is not that
complicated.
