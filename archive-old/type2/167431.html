Is the fuel mixture affected if you use the left head on the right? I  
don't know...

&gt; Are there 'bad' push rod tube seals out there?

Yes, Viton seals are preferred.

&gt; Is there a specific problem on the heads that I can look for that  
&gt; would be a show stopper for me without machining or replacing the  
&gt; head?

Cracks. They can be hard to see so clean up the head, get out a  
magnifier and start with the ports.
