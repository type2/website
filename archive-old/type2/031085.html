&gt; &gt; My goodness! You intend to install the motor and tranny already bolted

&gt; Err... because it's easier that way? :-)  I have not done an automatic,
&gt; but I have done *lots* of manuals and, IMHO, removing and installing the
&gt; unit on a breadloaf body [1] is easier than installing them separately.

well I have a 78 automatic, and I have done it both ways, and I prefer
doing them seperately, I can get the engine in and out in far less time
than it usually takes me to get that !*&amp;#$ bolt on the rear hanger over
the starter motor.
