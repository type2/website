Subject: Clutch Adjustment

Is it possible to adjust your clutch too much?  There is still some play in 
the peddle(1/2 inch).  How do you know when its adjusted too much?

The reason I ask is that after adjusting the clutch our shift points are 
sooner.  I used to shift into third at about 34 miles per hour now it sounds 
like  I need to shift at about 28.  I've never noticed this before on any of 
our other dubs.  But then again the bus had alot of play in the pedal this 
time.

Should I assume that shifting points change when you adjust the clutch?

Anyone going to the Woodburn, Oregon Drive In for Volkswagen nite?? July 
29th.  Should be neat to see a bunch of old volksie's  at an old drive in!

Nothin left to do but smile, smile, smile!!
