Subject: Alt. Cooling boot needed...
To: Type2_at_type2_dot_com
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL - A

Every six months or so I ask this question. One day I might get lucky. Here 
goes: I need the cooling boot for a 70 amp alt., to be fitted into a ' 78 
2.0L Westy. This sucker is NLA and made of Unobtanium. I've been sitting on a 
freshly rebuilt 70 amp. alt., (built to 90 amp by my local electrical wiz) 
for a year now. Just need that freaking boot, or an idea on how to fab one 
myself. Anyone out there want to trade my first born, dog, house or wife for 
one?
I'm Not Kidding!!!!!!!
