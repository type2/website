Why would VW have decided to reduce the size of the intake valve head between
the 1800 and the 2000?

Maybe to keep it cooler?  I know it runs at lower compression than the carb
engines. Other than that, i wouldn't know, but thats what the specs in my book
say - in two different places.
Looked some more and couldn't find anything but runout specs about the lobes
on the cam.
