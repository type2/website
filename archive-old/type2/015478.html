&gt;&gt;When customers admire the convertible on the showroom floor, just point out
&gt;&gt;that you can't get most of the parts needed for that car at the same dealer
&gt;&gt;the car is sitting in.

How many Ford dealers have in stock all parts necessary to assemble a 72
Fairlane??? Even if they have a showroom example that took someone many
years to restore at great effort to find the few unobtainium parts needed
that have been NLA for 20 years? Do they have all the parts in stock to
assemble a 2000 model? Or maintenance parts only? It is not logical to put
in stock parts which will sit for several years before the high milage
examples finally begin needing them. That's just wasting space for storage
and drives up costs. The low volume parts are at the regional warehouses
until the volume to meet market demand is so low that they become NLA. Ford
and many others will sometime license their production by others. That's
why some old Ford logo hood ornaments are available, with Ford's
permission, and a modest fee paid for the value of the license and use of
the logo.

If VW does not defend their name and logo, the law says &quot;who cares, not
us&quot;. Look at the stink Ford raised with body repair shops who used
aftermarket parts and called it the same as a Ford. They won when logo was
not at issue, only a suggestion that aftermarket imitations were 'as good
as' or met Ford specifications when it could be shown in many cases they
did not.
