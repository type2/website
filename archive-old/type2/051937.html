Subject: [T2] International Van Swapping.

Dear all,

I have just been looking at www_dot_campervan_dot_com wondering if it was a vw site.
It turns out that it's a campervan swapping site. What a great idea. Does
anyone know of a similar service for VW Campers. I don't know how someone
who had a bif RV would react to the offer of a 27 year old bus. I have been
looking at the costs of shipping Thom my 1973 Devon to the US and other
places that I'm interested in seeing. I am a firm believer that through the
windows of a Van is the way to see a country.

I know that quite alot of homeswapping goes on and always thought it was a
good idea. It would be nice to know that I was swapping with someone who had
a similar relationship with their van, it'd still be a pretty difficult
thing to do. I'm just getting to the stage of letting Kerry take the van off
with girlfriends and she holds my life together :-)

Check Thom out on the site.

Cheers
Have good weekends.
