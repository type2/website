76 Westfalia price?

Type2 folks,

The time has arrived at long last to get serious about selling my 1976 Westfalia
camper. It seemed as if the time to sell would never come because I have owned 
and cared it since November of 1982. But the future is now and I must press on 
with life without a Type2

My question to this group is about the selling price of the above vehicle. I 
know that condition is everything when it comes to older VW products. Here is 
a general description, brief history, and assessment of the camper's condition.

General factory items:
1976 VW Campmobile   111,000 miles   VIN 2362113961
4 speed
Chrome yellow with color-coordinated interior upholstery, green carpets
Basic campmobile equipment: 2 tables, curtains for all windows, sink 12 volt 
water pump with 7 gal. water tank, 1.1 cu. ft. icebox (You add the ice)
Optional equipment: front mounted spare tire, VW free-standing Campertent 
9ft x 9ft.

History:
The first owner bought the camper in Oregon and traveled around the west. He 
sold it to a lady in Houston, Texas in 1979 with 55000 miles on it. She used 
the van mostly for weekend camping trips and a tour of west Texas. She sold the
camper for the same reason I am now selling it. I'm just not using it enough! 
I bought the camper with 77163 miles on it in 1982. I did the usual things 
a new owner does, fix all the oil leaks and put everything back to factory 
specs. After moving to Ohio in 1985 I found a good dry garage to store the 
camper in for the winter months. The camper was a third car so it was never 
driven in the snow or on salt covered streets. An engine/transaxle transplant 
was done in 1987 at around 90k miles. After having several Monza exhaust 
systems on the camper I found an engine at a junk yard with a good factory 
exhaust and transaxle at a reasonable price. The 1977 bus that the engine/trans
came out of had only 54000 miles when it was crashed in the front. All seals 
were replaced along with clutch pressure plate and throwout bearing. I used all
the fuel injection hardware from the `76 because I did not get the EFI 
controller box (brain) with the `77 engine. All new CV (4) and boots were 
installed at this time. In 1989 at 95731 miles brake work was done. New rotors 
in front, new master cylinder, rear wheel cylinders, and new pads and shoes. 
The original Westfalia pop-top seals were replaced with a seal set from WCM in
1990. All fiberglass was cleaned primed and repainted with white enamel paint. 
The front seats were restored the at this time. Only the padding was replaced 
because the seat cloth was still in good condition. The muffer and tailpipe 
were replaced in 1992. I replaced all 4 of the copper exhaust seals which fit
between the heads and the first exhaust tubes while the exhaust system was off. 
KYB gas stocks were installed front and rear in 1993. Also both headlights were 
replaced with Halogen headlamps. This made a great difference in night driving. 
Last year I put a new battery in and this year the ignition switch was replaced.
Last month the camper passed Ohio's E check emissions test with flying colors.
As you can see the amount of miles driven per year in the camper has not been 
very great. If you take away the miles driven on 3 trips to Texas (~2500 round 
trip) and 2 trips to the east coast the camper would have lass than 100,000 
miles on it. All regular maintenance has been done on a time basis rather than 
mileage. I think the oil and filter changes have been done less than every 1000
miles on average.

General condition:
Not being driven in the northern winters has saved the body and pan from any 
rust. The paint is original except two areas where the PO had it repainted. 
There are some small parking lot dimples on the sides and some spots where 
touch up work was done. Some rust bubbles formed below the windshield but were 
taken care of.
The camping equipment is all in very good condition. All canvas has no rips and 
is clean. The tent is in good condition with only slight separation of the 
rubber seal form the canvas at each end of beading. All curtains are in good 
shape. The cabinets look like new and there is not a scratch on the surface 
around the sink. This area could be used as a cutting board! 
Looking at the text above shows that mechanically the camper is sound. Every 
thing works except the windshield squirters. The fact that it has been used 
sparingly and all systems have been closely maintained equals a camper in very 
good condition.

Price:
I have seen only a few ads for campers in the same shape as mine. I am going to 
use that information plus what a local VW club guy said, that a pristine camper 
of this era goes for $6500. He said that the range is around here goes from 
$6500 to $2500. I looking at getting a percentage of that high $6500 price.
Also when I do sell the camper I am including the original 1976 engine as spare 
parts.

Does anyone have any thoughts on what the fair price of this camper should be. 
I am planning to show it at the Cincinnati Volkswagen Club's Bugfest 96 on 
September 22.

Thanks in advance,

Jim
