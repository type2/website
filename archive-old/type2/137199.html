Subject: RE: Front Door Seals- glue or not?

Do I really need to use glue other than on the hinges side where there
is no groove?

Hi Mike,

I have had some that would stay tightly in the channels without glue and others that wouldn't. I would not use glue (except on the hinge side) and try it for awhile. If it wants to come out of the channel you can always glue it later.

Good Luck,
Bill Moon
