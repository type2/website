&lt;&lt; I was just wondering , has anybody ever put a flat 6 from a porsche in the
bus ?? Like from a 356 or 912 or 911 ?? I was just curious . 
 &gt;&gt;

Which 356 or 912 had the six, BTW ??
Even the 904 never got the extra cylinders, tho' the 914-6 did and con-
sidering what a rarity they are, I doubt anybody would donate an engine
willingly...;-(
