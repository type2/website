Subject: Re: can't find the leak.

Garp,

I had the same problem with my 73 campmobile &quot;Stella&quot;. Every time it
rained the water would build up in the same place and it would also soak
the rear cushion a little. I traced the leak to the bushings that go
between the fiberglass 'Westy roof and the original metal roof. I
removed the rear portion of the roof to find that the bushings were very
tired looking and the hole that the bushing screw was entering had a big
crack coming off it. (kind of like some one put a big load on the
luggage rack compartment and the pressure on the bushing caused a big
crack.)

The fix was easy. I used some marine silicone all around the screw hole
and crack (do both bushings as long as you have the roof off). I then
lined the bushing back on to the hole and waited for it to dry. This
creates a seal between the bushing and the metal roof. Be careful
putting the roof section back on. You don't want the bushing to tear
away from it's new silicone bed. Presto, no more leak. If you can get a
hold of new bushings it might make for a mess free job, but know one
sees all the silicone goop under the 'Westy roof so you can probably
recycle the old bushings if they are not totally shot.

Hope this helps. I've been in some wicked rain storms and &quot;Stella&quot; keeps
me very dry now.

Cheers,
Steve Selkirk '73 Campmobile with a 2.0 &quot;Stella&quot;
