Subject: Re: [T2] Coil Oil?

Darren, you are correct, an ignition coil is a set-up transformer.  If
working correctly, an ignition coil will step 12V up to 50,000V or more.
There isn't any amprege involved (very little) so having that high of a
voltage will not harm you, but will get your attention.  But a wall socket
with 120V is enough to put your lights out because it also carries the amps
with it.

If your ignition coil is leaking, it will in time stop working because the
oil is an insulator and heat conductor.

I noticed today my coil had a drop of what looks like oil
hanging down from the top of the coil. Am I correct in
assuming a coil filled with oil like a transformer?
Obviously, time to replace it.
