Subject: RE: [T2] Sheet Metal Piece on T1 Engine Cooling System

Hi Andrew,

A 1600 upright engine should have this piece of tin ware present (and an
unslotted piece for the #3and4 side). The fan housing is a narrow vertical
slot and blows its air directly towards the gap between the cylinders and
this piece of tin stops it blowing straight through that gap and causes air
flow around the whole circumference of the cylinder.
Remove this tin at your peril! As an engine will run hot without it.

Good luck

Subject: [T2] Sheet Metal Piece on T1 Engine Cooling System


I was just examining an original head that was used on a 73 Beetle.  It
was used on the 1-2 cylinders.  I noticed that there is a small sheet
metal piece embedded into the gap in the center that is used to block
some of the air flow to the thermostat.  It has a diagonal slot in it
for the thermostat rod.  Does anyone know if this piece was ever used on
the 71 Bus or earlier single port engines?  Any thoughts on running the
thermostat without this piece?  It looks like the purpose of the piece
is to make the thermostat react quicker to engine heat by shielding it
from the cooler air from the fan.
