Subject: 009

&gt;&gt;I should check and see if the distributor (a 009) is advancing correctly.

That's what i would do, as i think, from the info i saw, that it's not advancing
correctly, not at all, or that you have a faulty degree ring on your pulley.

&gt;The stock 7.5 deg BTDC spec is for a *stock* distributor, and the 009 is 
&gt;designed to be timed to a different place.  Probably somewhere around 20 
&gt;deg BTDC, if you're listening to your bus.  I'm sure someone else can 
&gt;give you the recommended timing for the 009.

A properly adjusted 009 will most likely be set at around 7, 8, 9 deg BTDC,
I would not recommend 20 deg static timing with 009 as the total advance
would be something like 40 to 45 deg BTDC, i'm pretty sure that'll destroy
any VW engine.

If you're swapping distributors and you want to determine the new static timing
point, take your old static timing point (OST) get the distributor advance of 
the original distributor (ODA), and the new distributor advance (NDA),
make sure to covert distributor degrees to crankshaft degrees 
(1 distributor deg=2 crankshaft deg) 

New Static Timing= (OST+ODA)-NDA

if: (i just put some numbers)

Old Static Timing, OST=7.5
Original Distributor Advance, ODA=20
New Distributor Advance, NDA=21

New Static Timing=(7.5+20)-21

New Static Timing=27.5-21

27.5-21= 6.5 crankshaft degrees. (if you get a negative number it's ATDC)

After you adjust the timing you can experiment a little, as the formula is not a 
guarantee things will be fine, it only helps to set the new distributor so as to 
give the same amount of total advance as the stock distributor did, the new 
static timing point might not let the engine idle properly, or the new distributor 
has  a very agressive advance curve, and the new distributor might give full 
advance at a different RPM. Be careful with settings of more than 30 crankshaft 
degrees total advance (static+distributor) be sure to check your engine's
temperature frequently until you're sure things are fine. Be extra careful when
you have an extractor exhaust system, as that will make it harder to detect
detonation.

How to make your own '009'.

You can make your own 009 if you have some old distributors laying around.
Either call your Bosch importer to ask the specsheet of your distributor#, or
stick the distributor in an engine with a (properly) degreed pully and use a
timing light to see how much it advances without the vacuum advance 
connected, the spec sheet is the better way to go as you can ask for a
231 178 009 spec sheet at the same time so you can compare the distributor
you have to the 009. Remove the vacuum cannister and the point plate from 
the distributor body, the point plate is actually two plates, remove the top one,
now you have the 009 point plate, it's exactly the same (actually, most of the 
time, early 70s C+V distributors), you only need to tap the hole for the screw 
that holds the points (M2 or M3) the holes are in the proper location, but note 
that the points have moved, so make sure that you change the #1 marking on
the edge of the distributor body accordingly, so that #3 will get it's 
less-advanced-than-the-others spark. If you're lucky you have the distributor
body with an oval hole for the vacuum cannister, if that's the case you can 
use an oval plug from another distributor to plug it, these plugs are either black 
or white plastic or stamped out of sheetmetal. You might end up with a distributor
that suits your needs better than a 009.

I would only recommend a centrifugal advance distributor for engines with (big) 
dual carbs or that have other modifications to their intake system that disturb the
vacuum signal in the manifold and thus would not actuate the vacuum advance 
properly. The stock distributor should work properly on a stock engine.

check them)
