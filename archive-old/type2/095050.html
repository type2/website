Subject: motor/part # question

Hello,

I have been going over the receips for my bus recently, so I know
what I might be due for soon. It looks like in 1988 the PO put a new
motor, or maybe just heads, on the bus.

The receipt shows two items, both at a cost of $747.29

The part numbers are :

VWA 039100031D/1
VWA 039100031D/2

The description is :

New 2.0 75/79
New 2.0 75/79

There is also a receipt for installing a customers motor, for about $400. So 
I guess it was a new motor, but why the two part numbers?

Anyway, it was put in about 44,000 miles ago. The bus has 180,000 miles on 
it now, and I am just wondering what I will need to start having done for a 
big trip we are taking later this year. In august, we will be using it on 
our honeymoon for a month long trip through the mountains/etc.

I know it has hydraulic lifters, so I don't have to adjust those, but are 
there any maintenence things that I should have done to a &quot;new&quot; motor at 
around 44,000 miles?

Thanks for any thoughts, suggestions, or general tomfoolery...

Christopher
