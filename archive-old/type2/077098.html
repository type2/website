Subject: Gas in the Oil

Hello All, (Happy New Year too!)

I have been working on this problem for a little while with help from the
archives and my Bently manual.

I have a poor sense of smell but the oil leak under my car and the full
dipstick means that either the oil fairies visit me at night or I have gas
entering the system to make up for the lost oil.  The oil also seems thin
too.

After reading the archives and the manuals I have done some testing on the
fuel system.  The diagnostics that I have done (or not done) are:

A compression test when I bought the van about 7 months ago (it was good in
the 110-120's) but I have not rechecked.
Tested the cold start valve for leakage.
Got a fuel pressure tester and the results are that the pressure in the ring
does read around 35 psi after a cranking the starter.  If left, the pressure
drops to about 32-30 PSI in 10 minutes and 20 psi in maybe 25 minutes.
Maybe a bit less.

I pulled all the injectors, operated them, and looked for leaks.  I did not
find any drips at all on these, which makes me a bit suspicious that I was
not doing them right as the manuals both say 2 drips a minute are OK.  Or no
drips the ideal anyway?

Then I checked the cold start valve again because I like the torture of
taking it off.  Still no leaks.

Finally, I put the injectors back in and the cold start valve and started
the engine with the gauge still hooked up to the ring.  It flutters from
about 36 PSI to 42PSI.  This is with the vacuum hose connected AND without.
To be honest I did not check the connection that well as it was getting dark
and cold by then. The hose that I connected was from on top of the air
intake to the fuel pressure regulator.  It had a T connector at the
regulator but the other hose has gone so I eliminated the T while I was
testing it. It is at least a tight as me other connections but that is not
saying a lot at this point.

The last test seems like very high pressure readings for the ring. It is
supposed to be around 28 PSI right?  Could a highly pressured ring cause the
gas in the oil by causing the injectors to inject too much gas?

More background:  The car is a 79 westie, with a 2.0 liter FI and I use it
mostly on short city trips (10 minutes to and from work).

Any advice of other strategies for testing?

Thanks,

Graham Facer
79 Westy
