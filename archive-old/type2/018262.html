Dear friends at the Bus Boys:

Do you have the adjustable kit for the front bean and rear in your catalog?.  I
recently requested one and I´m just expecting to see if you have it there.  I
also intend to lower my transporter but last week I went to the beach and
wished for a moment to have the van 4 to 5 in ches up in stead of down.   Does
your kit also permits to be used to raise it?.

Thanks for your comments.

Regards,
Pedro/

73 Transporter.
