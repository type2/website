Subject: how long will my motor likely last then?

Hi Connie ~~~
There are a ton of variables with our Bus situations: maintenance, driving
habits, quality of parts, and so on....
Very, very generally speaking, your more complex (than mine, anyway) Bus has
a better chance of something crapping out than a simpler machine. Regular
and careful maintenance, however, should give you plenty more time.
Other listees might be able to give you some specific problem areas to check
out before investing in a new camper top to show off at EveryBus in
Greensboro, NC this coming April. :-)
