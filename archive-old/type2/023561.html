Subject: 77 AFM, Temp sensor I (disconnect).
Message-ID: &lt;5bef8bab.248466d9_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I have been having trouble with my 77 westy recently (2.0L FI).  And had 
traced it to the AFM.  I tested the resistance for the temp sensor 1 (in the 
AFM) and it was below the specifications.  So I assumed it was the other part 
of the AFM (the resistive tracks that the potentiometer moves on).  BUT, I 
adjusted that plate and no luck, the engine still skips and runs like CRAP!

So I disconnected the two terminals for the temperature sensor (disconnected 
the terminals in the AFM itself).  The engine now runs as it should.  What I 
am wondering is if anyone else has ever done this and what will this do to 
the way my engine runs??  I don't run it during the winter so I assume it 
will only run richer than it really should (hotter air less dense).

Any comments would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance,
Mike
