&gt;Anyway, the reason for writing is that while studying the diagrams, I noticed
&gt;something that looked like a narrow shelf over the muffler and under the tin.
&gt;The parts guy guessed that it may have been a heat shield protecting the
&gt;engine tin from the muffler heat. I don't have it but then I have none of the
&gt;original equipment beyond the heater boxes. Was that the purpose of this
&gt;piece and if so, would it aid cooling to rig a shield over the muffler?

I think it's a heat shield.  It's a very hard to find piece, because they
tended to rust out and fall off.  I ran without one for a while and it
eventually caused my foam engine seal to get crispy on the lower parts in
the back.  I'm sure it affected the temperature of the air entering the
engine, too.  Good thing to have, if you can get it.
