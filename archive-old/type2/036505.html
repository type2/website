Subject: Corvair engine conversion (Blasphemy?)
Content-Disposition: Inline

I have access to a garage full of Corvair engines and need an engine for
my 83 Vanagon Westy. I remember a magazine article from years ago re
this conversion. Anyone out there have it or done this conversion and if
so is it worth the trouble? Obviously more power which I want  but it
must be reliable with heat and A/C. I realize I may incur the wrath of
true Type 2 Types with this request.
