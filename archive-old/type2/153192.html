Subject: auxiliary air regulator characteristics

I am having trouble maintaining idle when cold on an FI engine and I 
just pulled the auxiliary air regulator to have a look.

What I see when I look through the orifice is a moveable metal vane 
with a notch in it. This vane/notch is already a good way into the 
circular opening. I estimate that perhaps 15 % of the area of the 
opening is not obscured by the vane when it is cold. So very little 
air is allowed through and this could lead to my low idle situation.

I would appreciate any info from someone who has looked down the pipe 
on one of these. What should I see inside there? Is this 15% open 
area normal?

thanks, jack
