Subject: Re: advice needed on state inspection

&gt;I don't know MD law specifically, but if MD inspectors are like those in
&gt;the great commonwealth of PA, cosmetic rust holes WILL flunk you. I know
&gt;of people that have passed with duct tape and spray paint, so bondo and
&gt;paint would work. Fiberglass is another alternative. As easy as bondo, and
&gt;I think the results are better.

When I had to register my first bus 6 years ago (a 70 Westy) I decided to
take it to some body shops for estimates before the Connecticut state
inspection.  The places that would give me an estimate said to repair just
the rust/rot under the front lip and dog legs would run around $1500 (hmmm,
guess I should've had some estimates done before I bought the bus), so I
gave up that idea and decided to bring it through inspection and resolve to
drive a beater bus.  

The night before the inspection I removed the front bumper to clean up some
rust and do a quick repaint.  For some reason, the next morning I woke up
determined to bring the bus to inspection---only I forgot I had removed the
bumper the previous day.  I remembered the bumper was missing as I went
through my mental checklist in the inspection line-up.  My heart sunk and I
drove forlornly up to the inspector.  For some reason the inspector didn't
notice the missing bumper (must be those smooth body lines on the front of a
bus!) or he just took pity on this clod in a rusty bus.  After looking the
bus over, he said he would pass me if I promised to bondo over the rust
holes and rough edges around the bus--I promised (scout's honor!) and he
passed me!

That was bizarre and atypical but it happened.  A few years later I drove a
79 Buick Regal through inspection for a friend that I was quite confident
would pass (I remembered to check the front bumper).  The inspector crawled
under with a hammer/chisel and proceeded to carve a hole in the frame.  A
local shop welded a piece of scrap metal over the carved hole and $20 later
I returned to the inspection station and it passed.  

Some stations here have more of a reputation than others for failing old
cars so you can attempt to drive out of your county/area to another
inpection station.   However, you can also look suspicious if the inspector
notices from your DMV paperwork that you are registering a car in one county
and you just drove across the state to their notoriously lenient inspection
station to gamble on a pass.  The luck of the draw, I guess.
