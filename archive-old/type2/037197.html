do a valve job, and replace the exhaust valves. Install Viton (silicone) PR
tube seals. VWs need exhaust valve replacement at 40K miles, or you are
asking for it. (please don't e-mail me saying you have 120K miles with no
problems, you are against the odds)

&gt; The 79 I now own was purchased for a friend of mine.  I know the last 11
&gt; years of it's history.  I rebuilt the engine about 4 years ago for him.
The
&gt; question is this.  I have to pull the engine to do the clutch.  I am
&gt; thinking about pulling the heads to have them checked out.  The engine has
&gt; about 35000 miles since the rebuild.  It is running good with just a small
&gt; oil leak at the push rod tubes.  Should I pull the heads or am I being to
&gt; cautious?  Any thoughts on this would be appreciated.
