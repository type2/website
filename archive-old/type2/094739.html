Subject: Re: [T2] Re: when it lost its heritage




&gt;[...]
&gt;
&gt; &gt;So when did it lose its bus heritage?
&gt;
&gt;Late 1971, right?
&gt;
&gt;;-)
No. So wrong. It was 1964. Like we need a big read window and 1 ton load 
capacity. Although my 63 had it (as an option).
Every thing since then was some damn van.
