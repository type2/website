Count me in.  I'll start saving my pennies today.  If I would have know of the 
Inuvik trip a year in advance I would have probably made the whole trek for that 
one too.  It's not that a vacation in a bus is all that expensive.  It's just that 
being self employed means that I don't get paid while I'm on vacation.  So if I 
know far in advance I can make sure that I have no loan payments or other large 
expenses (other than rent) that need to be paid while I'm away.
