Andy:
NO ONE changes points every 3,000 miles. it's not recommended. I think normal
life is 12-20k miles for a tune-up. And the points will go much longer. I just
have a guage with a point resistance setting and use that as my guide. 2
wires, turn on the ignition, read the meter.
I think Pertronix is  a &quot;poor answer to a question no one asked&quot;!

&gt; Assuming that you are repl points/cond at 3000 mi tune up intervals.
&gt; Of course you might say that the points can last a lot longer than that
&gt; but I would counter that the oil will too but you still change it.
