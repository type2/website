Subject: blinkers and flashers

Took the 71 westy for a spin this a.m. and have developed a new problem.  When
I turn on the turn signals the generator light comes on and the outside lights
don't blink.  They  do blink when I turn on the emergency flashers but the
generator light comes on also.  Any thoughts or suggestion are appreciated.
Steve
