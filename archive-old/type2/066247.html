Subject: Mexican T2 water pumpers, shift linkages, paint jobs

        The Mexican T2 waterpumper is NOT a waterboxer, its the
1600cc Rabbit engine with the beloved K-Jet almost-all-mechanical
FI system. I saw a Mexican T2 in San Jose the other day- lovely,
sealing wax red, we think Baja plates. But I posted the sighting
to the Vanagon list since it's a watercooled item ;)

        Someone said the high-top was fiberglas- it looked like metal
to me, and from a cost and strength stand point, metal makes more sense.
I KNOW, because I crawled under one AND have a brochure, that the 
engine is the straight 4. But I didn't tap on the top...

        Mike Peebles,
        Check the shift coupler between the shift rod and the front
of the transmission, 'cos its easiest to get to ;) Then pull off the
belly pan the protects the underneath of the pedals and make sure
everything is tightly attached, clean and well lubricated where the
shifter goes through the floor.

        I endorse everything RVB says about paint and finish- preparation
is all and get your expectations AND what you will do yourself in writing.
Ask questions, be polite, look at examples of the work the shop does (Look
CLOSELY) and demand refernces. Talk to at LEAST 3 shops. Yes, its a lot
of work, but less than doing it yourself. 

        Auto repair, including body and paint, is not prostitution- you're 
not paying them to pretend they love you. At the same time, for the 
money you will spend, you should be amazingly happy with the results.
Its too much money not to be, dig? And remember Deming's fourth point:

&quot;Cease doing business on the basis of price tag alone&quot;

        Mah Bruddah an Hsss Waf got a super paint job on their Beetle for &lt;2K.
But they stripped everything excecpt the head liner and gas tank themselves,
and had it flat-bedded to the painter, who was recomended by the local
and trusty aftermarket parts guy in town. They shopped for the paint job
for over a month, and made the point that it wasn't an insurance job
where they needed to get the car back tomorrow to drive to work. They
visited and inspected during the job. The car was at the shop for 3 weeks
and returned looking like a new one on the production line. They spent
two months on reassembly, and had a shop do the the felt seals for the
front windows, also as recomended by the local aftermarket guy. I saw
new late-60s beetles on show rooms floors and the results are very
similar. They say they can see defects in the paint, but I can't until
they're pointed out. It looks new.
