&gt; I think you should maybe at this point you should take a step back and

The rub is that I would need to make wiring modifications anyway.  With 
the Hyfire, coil + is no longer switched +12v, so all of those 
connections would need to move somewhere else in any case, and I would 
still need to relocate all the stuff that normally sits on coil -.

Essentially, I would trade terminal blocks for a mess of spade 
connectors.  I'm not sure that buys me any extra simplicity.

&gt; That's my guess as well. My L-Jet tester can measure the pulse width 
&gt; and
&gt; confirm that but I can't made it up to the city today to help.

No problem.  Wanna try next Sunday?
