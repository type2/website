Subject: Engine Compartment Lid Seal ?

Howdy

I'm trying to install an engine compartment lid seal that I got from OE Vee 
Dub.
I called them up to ask which side goes towards the body and his response 
was &quot;We sell them but we dont work on them, so I dont know.&quot;

Every time I put one side towards the body it seems like that would be 
correct until I turn it around and think maybe the other way is correct.

Picture can be found here:

So if anybody has ever gotten this seal from them and knows which side goes 
towards the body and would let me know I would appreciate it.

Thanks
Kevin
