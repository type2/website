Hi All-

    It has finally warmed up enough for me to start working on my bus
again.  I am currently converted from an auto to a manual tranny.
    I am trying to get a list of all the sizes and lengths of the
varoious nuts/bolts throughtout my '74 westy.  I figure that as long as
I am taking off stuff I might as well replace them with Stainless.

Frankie
