Subject: Re: [T2] Push Button Starter

I'm sure that this is not the problem in your particular no start
scenario but I thought it might be worth mentioning: The most recent
Westy I bought (81) had the ignition switch wired through the backup
light switch on the tranny (IE had to be in reverse to start). In
addition he had a second solenoid near the starter and a push button on
the dash. Many of the connectors on the fuse panel had melted insulators,
several of the red wires under the dash were burned and the insulation
melted off. Just in general terms this Westy was patched with a solenoid
and switch and I can only suspect that the reverse light switch acted as
some type of anti theft devise. I'm sure this work around was working for
him because the Westy was running but I returned the wiring to OEM and
found that the thermo time switch was loose (I removed the rubber gasket
and put a slight twist on the male connectors and that fixed it. The
plastic outer locking shroud was broken on the connector also.)
You really don't want one of these bastard get you by work arounds on
your vehicle, it can fail and smoke the whole electrical system. (Well at
least all of the red wires in your van).

&gt; After a lot of testing/contemplation, I think I am going to rig a 
&gt; push button for my starter on my 81 vanagon.
