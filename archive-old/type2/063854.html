Subject: Re: Vanagon radio

&gt;If not, is there any harm in having the vehicle &quot;on&quot; for any length of time
&gt;just to listen to the radio? Is anything actually on other than the warning
&gt;lights?

Yes.  This position charges your coil, and after extended periods can burn
it out.  (leave it in this position for a while, then go see how many
seconds you can keep your hand on your coil!)

The solution, after much discussion on the vanagon list, seems to be wire
it to the buzzer circuit.  I just popped out the (non working anyway)
buzzer, crimped on a push on connector to the end of the hot wire from the
radio and plugged it in at the fuse box.  Now, whenever the key is in the
iginition, your radio works.  Take the key out, off goes the radio.  And no
need to turn it to the on position.

Good luck
