Subject: Re: [T2] CDI rotors

From squid:

I have a Petronix Ignitor that says on the block inside the distributor,
 carb   EO,  D-67 2.  The rotor is brown with a black material between the rotor and the coil contact patch.
Since I bought it used and complete, is this possibly a Petronix rotor, and there fore ok for long use, so I
do not have to modify it as Mr Heulsman article suggests?  Thanks

Get an ohmmeter and measure the resistance between the center and the tip.  0 ohms is what you need to see. If
you see any more than that, then no, it is a stock rotor.
