Subject: re: Eberspacher BN4 installation

Stephen,
I just installed the same heater in my '71. I did a lot of research first.
The best manuals I've found were provided by Espar. See the link at
type2_dot_com in the library. They sent me a nice copy for free in about a week.
I still had a problem with locating the holes in the firewall and into the
passenger compartment because I didn't have the templates they talk about.
You can pretty much eyeball it though using the pictures and dimensions in
the pictures. Everybody recommended I remove the engine but I didn't and am
not sorry. It worked out ok. I used a combination of metal shears, drill
bits and grinder to cut.
I had a muffler shop add the rusted off part of the exhaust pipe onto what I
had. Mine was rusted off right about where it exits the body. You'll need
some hole saws to cut through the body for the exhaust, fuel line and
combustion supply hose. I used 3/4&quot; with rubber grommet for the fuel line,
2&quot; for the exhaust (even though I need to caulk around the original heat
resistant grommet because the new exhaust is 1/8&quot; smaller than original) and
1 3/8&quot; for the air supply line.  Ask me if you need any more help.

I'd like to thank all you listees out there that helped me in my project.
You know who you are! The heat is awesome and it's been mighty cold here in
Denver recently.

&gt;Message-Id: &lt;200302251845.h1PIjPm10807_at_mtbaker.tfm_dot_com&gt;

&gt;I just picked up a BN4 for my bus, complete with duct work and
&gt;wiring. The archives tell me that there were some installation
&gt;instructions/temlates floating around but I don't know the
&gt;current status. Does anyone have this info? I'd be willing to
&gt;pay reasonable copying and shipping costs to get a copy.

&gt;I'm also looking for a manual that's in decent shape. I have found
&gt;some .tif scans of one online but the quality is not very good.

&gt;Thanks in advance for any help!

&gt;--Stephen
