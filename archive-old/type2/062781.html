Subject: Stuck bus...something ain't right

&lt;snip&gt; of jonathan's long detailed description of weird &quot;stuck bus&quot; problem.

It could still be rusty brakes, even if they are new. I parked my bus 
in the driveway once and washed it. I hosed out the wheelwells really well.
Next morning,I hopped in, fired her up, popped the emergency brake- 
and just sat there. My rear drum brakes were frozen. A little tap on the gas 
pedal caused them to release with a very audible &quot;CRACK!&quot; Then I drove to work,
thinking that the water in the wheelwells must have coated the brakes and 
made enough rust overnight to lock 'em in place. They were less than a year old.
Just one of those things, I guess.

Drive safely,
Surfer Bob
