&lt;&lt;  how old is this Eastwood ??
&gt; 
&gt; I have never heard of them, my question simply; if
&gt; eastwood is a new company then how can one just its
&gt; durability over the test of time?? &gt;&gt;

The Eastwood company has been around for quite a
while...Basically, they're the J.C. Whitney of restor-
ation products...Some good, some bad, but useful
for a quick overview of what's available if the old
crate has just been dumped in your carport and
you're wondering how to bring it back...
As to POR-15 vs. Eastwood...I don't doubt that
both products work well if the directions are pre-
cisely followed...Relatively easy for a magazine
with a fully-outfitted test lab and project car...
I'm much more interested in results from guys
like me and you whose cars are out in the im-
perfect world... ;-(
