&gt; I cannot for the life of me
&gt; get any of the dang lugnuts to start loosening up. When I had this random
&gt; shop give me an estimate a month back, they must have just gone nuts with
&gt; the airpowered gun and they are essentially welded in place it seems.
&gt; 
&gt; Should I run buy one of those cross shaped lugwrenches, so I get more
&gt; leverage and hopefully then will be able to bust them loose, or do I need to

get a piece of pipe and slide over the wrench you have and break it loose

&gt; wait till tuesday to find a shop someplace with an airgun where they can
&gt; break them free for me?

yeah and NEVER let em put your lug nuts on with an airgun, I will hand em
my spinner lug wrench and tell em to put em on with that...figure if they
put em on with it I can get it off
 &gt; 
&gt; Jeez, if I had a flat tire I would be screwed. Or maybe the shop was made

been there done that, pouring rain at night, finally had to &quot;borrow&quot; a
piece of a farmers fence to use as a breaker bar...not fun
