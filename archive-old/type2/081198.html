Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel sensor accessability

I have my tank out at the moment and I think I mentioned the removal of the
trannsmission bolts and rear engine mounts allows you to drob the engine 2
or 3 inches without unhooking it.
I watched my fatherinlaw do the job without doing this and swore i would
rather drop the motor.
If it was a really mint bus I wouldn't cut the rear deck, if it was a bit
beat already I would (and have)
The late style sender seems to fail frequently enough that VW should have
added an access panel.
The earlier ones up to mid 73 I think worked better. Perhaps this is when VW
caught up with the other manufacturers and discavered &quot;designed
obsolescence&quot;. Anyway...........................blabla
Good Luck
Brian

Subject: [T2] Fuel sensor accessability


&gt; Hi guys,
&gt; The fuel guage on my 77 9-seater Microbus is pretty
&gt; unreliable.
&gt; When you fill up the tank it's fine &amp; reads well down
&gt; to about half way.
&gt; Then the gremlin gets in the works and it goes on and
&gt; off like a yo-yo!
&gt; I took it to the auto-electricians yesterday and they
&gt; said they think it's the sender after examining the
&gt; guage.
&gt; Problem is, apparently the only way to reach the
&gt; sensor is either to cut through the floor or to remove
&gt; the engine, and to be honest, I'd rather avoid both
&gt; methods if at all possible.
&gt; I have nowhere to lay under the car at home &amp; so I
&gt; really can't do the work myself.
&gt; Will the engine have to be removed to get at it or is
&gt; there a tricky way to do it without such a major
&gt; manouvre?
&gt; If not, should I just wait until I get the clutch
&gt; replaced(probably later this year) &amp; have it repaired
&gt; then?
&gt; The problem about the fuel guage is that I live in the
&gt; country 20kms(12 miles) outside of town &amp; each run in
&gt; &amp; out uses a visible amount of fuel........I really
&gt; can't afford to not know how much is there.
&gt; Any clue would be a help.....
&gt; :-)
&gt; Cheers
