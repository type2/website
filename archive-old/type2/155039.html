Subject: RE: [T2] Factory Side Step??

&gt; http://www.donimages_dot_com/guac/images/sidestep.jpg
&gt; Is that what I think it is? Anybody seen one in person?

&gt; It's a scan of the sidestep from the Type 2 ambulance.

&gt; It has a pedal that you push on and the step will slide 
&gt; out by itself, you the just push it back and it locks itself
&gt; till you release it again 
 
&gt; Wow! I'd give my left... well, you get the idea... for one 



I have an N.O.S. one of these retracting side steps that I brought back with
me from Germany many years ago. Very rare item, of course.  It had been a
dealer return, and on brief inspection it is missing some of the ancilliary
hardware (1, 7, 8, and 10-14 in the diagram, it appears) but is of course in
nice condition.  I'd sell it for $140 as-is if someone wants it. Email me.

I also carry repros of the later style larger non-retracting side steps, for
$129:
