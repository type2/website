Subject: Re: [T2] BB in vacuum line?

&gt; Hopefully no more BB's! The reason I asked is that I have read that if the
&gt; tank is filled to fast or overfilled that the cannister can get some liquid
&gt; fuel into it and turn the charcoal into a solid mass. Maybe not. Ill put it
&gt; on the long list of things to check/do.

It might turn into a paste but I think unless it's had a chance to sit for
long time it would run out from the bottom. If activated charcoal can filter
water without solidifying, gasoline probably behaves the same. Don't quote
me.

&gt; Hey while were kind of on the subject of vacuum hoses. I bought 12mm and
&gt; 14mm hoses from Pelican Parts. They are very thin and colapse under vacuum.
&gt; I tried them on the auxiliary air valve and they just didnt hold up.

The big hose is 12mm x 3.5mm. The little one is 13mm x 3.5mm.

&gt; Any idea if this is going to be a problem to find good hose?

I can vouch for the Bus Boys hose:

Hose - From Air Intake Elbow Boot to Aux Air Control Valve
N 20374.08  1975-1979  $2.00 (Hose Pre-Cut To Size)

Hose Elbow - Aux Air Control Valve to Hose above
022-129-637   1974-1979  $2.55

Hose - Aux Air Valve to Center Air Plenum
022-133-127   1974-1979   $2.75

The 12mm is just a little to small to use for the small piece. They figured
this out already for you.
