Subject: Leaking Brake Reservoir (ideas?) 

Just notice no brake fluid in the reservoir this morning , filled it up ,
leaking like crazy. Small Crack right above where the hose attaches under the
reservoir. Pulled it off and cleaned it up.
Can this be patched/glued with something? Gorilla Glue ? I know Brake Fluid is
corrosive.

I don't know where I could find a replacement. I'm sure they are scarce.

It's a 71 Westy.

Thanks,
Trey
