Subject: Dealing with dealers

Went to the VW dealer again to pick up some parts and this time another
parts guy was there. I asked him if could look up a 78 Type2 in the system
and he said sure but he didn't like to.  Gimme a break.

It was bad enough the last guy lied to me and said he could only do part
lookups back to 1983 but why not just see if the part number I'm giving them
is available and order it.  I wish the other dealer wasn't so far away...
