Subject: Bus (truck) sighting

List:
Saw a pretty cool movie the other day named &quot;The Snapper&quot; (wierd name,
but I'm not -yet- Irish). It's a coming-of-age-type movie for daughter
and father and the main family car is a truck, a 1974-79 Single Cab!
And it was an authentic used car lot vehicle: RHDrive, originally ivory,
painted over olive green and chipping off, wrong mirrors, but solid and
running and sounded authentic (don't you just hate it when some high
paid foley artist makes a vw sound like something else?)(I wish my 69
double cab had REASON to sound like a 911, but that's another subject).
So, anyway, I'M IN LOVE with this truck and if anyone in Ireland is
listening: I WANT TO BUY IT (or one like it).

69 double cab (but smitten with a later one)
