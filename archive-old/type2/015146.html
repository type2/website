I had just put my ad up for my '71 WF on classifieds2000, and ran a search,
thinking there would be maybe 2 or 3 in the country.  WOW!  There's all
kinds, 78 of them, synchros included, from $1,200 to $20,000+.  If you're
looking for a Westy, try this link:

sultsn   

Mine's the one in Fort Worth (shamelsss commercial plug).  Cheers!
