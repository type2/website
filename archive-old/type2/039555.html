&gt; I have taken a picture of the fans you are talking about. These also are the
&gt; ones that I am trying to trade for a middle seat for my 63.

Anyone tried the bilge-blower solution to get this effect?  I'm talking
about fresh air blower, NOT heater boost.  Looks like a reasonably sized
blower might fit the location.

I put a 12V fan on my dash, but it just moves the hot air around inside
the car.  Something to suck in cooler outside air at stoplights would be
nice.
