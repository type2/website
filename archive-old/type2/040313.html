Hi there, A good place to check out would be your local engineering works, I
get all my metal from such a place, and can often get quite large offcuts
for as little as £5.00 a piece,which go along way when patch welding.

&gt; I'm getting ready to replace all the rusted metal on my 71 Westy. Where's
the
&gt; best place to order it from? My main concerns are, first, quality and
second,
&gt; price. I'm going to be ordering quite a bit, so I will prefer to order
&gt; everything from the same place. Thanks in advance for any help.
