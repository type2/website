&gt; How tall a door do I need on my garage?

my 78 without poptop but with canoe stands 7ft 4in
remember garage doors that roll up do not normally have full height
clearance.
  not to mention being able to lift vehicle even a little without hitting
motor or drive mech.

suggest 9 high if there is anyway you can swing it.

lots of luck
