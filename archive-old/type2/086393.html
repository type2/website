Subject: RE: [T2] 68 to 71 brake light/turn signal info needed

Paul,

The '68-'71 wiper switch.

A hot wire from the third fuse runs to the brake light switch. The brake
switch on the master cylinder makes a connection when the brake is pressed,
this brings 12 v to the 54 terminal on the emergency flasher switch, then
back out on 54f to the turn signal switch terminal 54st. When the turn
signal switch is in the neutral position the now hot 54st is mechanically
connected to both HR and HL these brighten the brighter filament in the rear
tail lights. When the turn signal switch is put into the left or right
position. The 54bl terminal is contributing and now the emergency flasher
relay interrupts the power intermittently to turn on then off the left or
right bright filament. The other brake light (none directional side) is
still on solid.

1. No
2. Yes
3. No

The tail lights are the dim filament and the brake and the turn signal are
both the bright filament.

Help any?

Subject: [T2] 68 to 71 brake light/turn signal info needed


Hi List,
    I need some info regarding the brake lights/turn signals.  Our bus is a
71 so that's what I'm concerned with but I believe 68 to 71 work the same in
these systems.  Here's what I need to know, when you have your foot on the
brake and either direction selected on the turn signal switch, what is
supposed to happen to the rear light on the side that the turn signal is
selected to?
1.  Does it stay on steady as a brake light?   or
2.  Does it flash on and completely off over and over, as a turn signal?
or
3.  Does it flash bright as a turn signal and then dim down to be a brake
light between flashes?    or
4.  does it do something else that my poor tired brain can't think of right
now?
    And as usual, thanks for the help.
