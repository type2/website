How about VW ? They still make them.

I got one this year from VW Heritage but I think Just Kampers are now
cheaper.

Subject: [T2] slider windows

Hello All, I'm planning on putting slider windows in 74 bus.  Does anyone 
know of a source to obtain these?  I'm been looking through all my catalogs 
and I'm coming up empty.  Thanks, Marcus
