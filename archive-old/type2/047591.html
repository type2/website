&gt; Avoid any tire store that doesn't tighten your lug nuts with a torque
&gt; wrench, using factory specified torque values.  And you shouldn't have to
&gt; ask, it should be their standard procedure.

The tire stores should also be using a neversieze material on all of the
wheel fastener threads.  I always do this, and recommend you'al should do it
too, (neversieze and torque wrench).
