Subject: Re: [T2] bloody mice!!

Bernie, beset by mice, told us too late

&gt;I put a
&gt;bunch of poison in there tonight.  Maybe they'll chew on that instead of
&gt;the bed!

	Poisoning rodents can leave carcasses hidden in places you 
wouldn't normally access.
With luck they'll get dehydrated, but I wouldn't count on it. 
Trapping is better.  Don't omit to nail down the trap, as it can be 
dragged away by the dying rodent to one of those hidden dying-spots.
