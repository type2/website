The question isn't whether it's possible, it's whether it's worth it. Why
is the engine locked up? (I assume you mean seized, in that it won't turn
over?) If it's been sitting awhile, you may be able to bring it back to
life by squirting Marvel Mystery Oil down the spark plug holes and letting
it sit a week, after which you can do a compression test even if it won't
start. Or it may be that it's got a thrown rod or chipped valve, in which
case you can probably do better if all you want's the engine. ($500 for a
good body is pretty cheap, though, if you can use it.)

Also, if you're '78 has a 2.0-litre, is this '75 a 2.0-litre as well? It
may be a 1.8, which isn't quite as desirable for a number of reasons I
won't list here.

&gt; My question is that I have found a '75 Westi with a complete motor and
&gt; interior, but the engine is locked up. It looks good on the outside and
&gt; there is no oil on the ground. The body is in perfect health. Is it
&gt; possible to rebuild a lock T4 and be able to bet miles out of it. The PO
&gt; wants &lt;$500&gt; for the whole thing, including locked motor
&gt; 
&gt; Help Please.
