Putting on his gov't worker hat Steve sez... yes and no, more or less :-)
In a  perfect world, there would be a different flywheel lock for every
diameter and tooth count of flywheel.  In the one we live in, the ones
you commonly see are flippable and labeled 6V and 12V.  thes are for the
T1 engines made from the 50s thru the early 70s and really don't fit a
1978 T4 very well at all.   In an emergency, I *have* used one, and it
did work, but I far prefer the 5' angle iron with a hole drilled in one
end of it.

Take the pressure plate off and use one of the pressure plate bolts thru
the hole in the angle iron.  Put a second bolt in and prop the angle iron
against it.  If you have a friend handy, have them hold the angle iron; if
you don't, rotate the engine until the angle iron is propped against the
floor, then stand on the engine while loosening the bolts in the flywheel.

Remember that the T4 flywheel is held on by five bolts that are (only :)
torqued to ?90? ft/lb, so the job is nowhere near as bad as on a T1, where
the torque is  200+.
