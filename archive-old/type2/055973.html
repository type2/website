Ned (&amp; the List,)

In my experience, rough running FI with &quot;rich&quot; symptoms is very often
caused by a non-functional or loose &quot;Temp Sensor II.&quot;  This is the
sensor over cyl #3 that tells the ECU what the engine temperature is.
Without this signal, the ECU sees the engine as cold and richens the
nmixture accordingly.  Grab your 14mm end wrench, and check its
tightness.  Will probably be loose.

Good luck.

I got in tonight to see what I could do.  It was still running the
same.  It acts as if it is only running on 2 cylinders, but it is
not, it has all four.  it will stall if I don't keep it running, and
even then it feels and sounds as if it is surging, and barely staying
alive.  I propped something against the fuel pedal to keep it going
so I could go back and take a look.  I pulled each of the cables at
the distributor, and each was firing.  There was a reduction in rpm
as I pulled each one, so I do believe everything is firing.  It seems
to be running really rich, and smells a lot like gas fumes aren't
being fully burnt.  I double checked the plug wires were all correct
(I have some ex girlfriends I wouldn't put it past...;-) ) and took
the distributor cap and rotor off and cleaned all the contact points.
no change.
