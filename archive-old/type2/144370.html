&gt; I worked on a project for a Chrysler supplier which will allow Chry-Co to market a turbo diesel PT Cruiser next year. Now whether they will sell it to us is another thing. Our cars are so wasteful compared to what alot of Europeans drive. I remember seeing one Italian fellow in Naples using a basic Oldsmobile as a wedding limo. Was just a 4 door Olds with V-8/auto tranny/a-c from the 80s.

Actually, several chrysler vehicles (minivan, Jeep Liberty, etc) have a
diesel option, but only if you happen to live outside the US.  :(
