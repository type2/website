Subject: Re: high top conversions

Hi Volks,

&quot;Andrew Davies&quot; &lt;andrewdavies_at_mrwhipy.freeserve.co_dot_uk&gt; wrote to the List:
&gt; VW made bay window busses with a factory fitted high-top, BUT they were only
&gt; fitted to panel vans. So if your looking for a Combi or Camper this will
&gt; have been a conversion! 

Just for the record:  Wrong.  There were factory highroof Kombis
available.  Rumour has it that factory highroof Westies could be
ordered too (as could hardtop or sunroof Westies), but I've never
come across one of those.  But after all, what's a Westy other
than a Kombi that's been to Wiedenbrück?  ;-)  (Well, almost.)

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
