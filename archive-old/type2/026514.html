&gt;Engine looked clean and ran smooth. I barely got it to 70 mph, is 
&gt;this a problem or indication of one? I drive about 700 freeway miles 
&gt;per mont. A/C blows but must need freon b/c no cold air came out.

If you were running the dread A/C when you were trying to achieve 70 mph
then your doing pretty good.  But with the A/C off, a stock 73 in decent
condition should do 70 with no problem (that'll be around 4000 - 4200 RPM
depending on tire size).  Your really don't want to push the engine much
more than that anyway!

What carb(s) setup is on it?  I run dual Weber 40 IDF's on mine and I've
seen better than 5000 RPM in 4th gear (about 90 mph).  I wouldn't recommend
it though - very scary and can't be too good for the 'ol powerplant.  

Check to make sure the throttle is full open when the gas pedal is mashed to
the floor.  Other than that, if your compression is good in all 4 cylinders
(120 psi+) and the valves, timing, and points are adjusted properly , the
only thing that would keep you from doing 70 is a really crappy carb.
Unless you were pushing a 30 mph head wind - that's a whole 'nuther story!!
