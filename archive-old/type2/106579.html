&gt; Ok, I drive someplace last night, park for 5 minutes, come back out,

&gt; my motor, that makes a loud clacking sound as the RPM's increase. I just
&gt; checked the oil level before I went out, and that seems to be ok. What
&gt; in god's name is this terrible new sound? 
&gt; 
&gt; The best way I can describe it is to say it sounds like a baseball cards
&gt; in your spokes.. Loud clacking sound that seems to go along with the
&gt; pace of the motor. 

check to see if something has been pulled into the fan or rubbing the
alt or belt

&gt; I have been pretty paranoid about the motor lately possibly needing a
&gt; rebuild, and I think that is what this has finally come to. =(

can you determine where in the motor it is coming from?
have you lost any power?
does it run differently or just noise??

&gt; Now, how to finance it? I guess I might have to take that BA6 project

with luck it might be something very simple
