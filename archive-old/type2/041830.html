FYI, if you look at the tin on top of your engine, the cylinder numbers
are pressed into it just by the spark plug holes.

Regarding the valve covers: when you put the gaskets on the cover, use
weatherstrip cement to bond the gasket to the cover.  Apply cement to
the gasket and to the cover, let it sit until the cement gets tacky, and
then place the gasket in the cover.  Let it dry for another few minutes
and then seat the cover and snap the spring in place.  The weatherstrip
cement holds the gasket in place so it's not squishing all over while
you try to get the spring on, saving you much grief and cursing.  Then,
when you do the valves again, and need to remove the gasket, it comes
off easily with minimal scraping.

If your valve covers still leak, try getting new springs.

&gt; I would just like to say thanks to all the people who helped with the
&gt; cylinder numbers.  Also i apologise in calling the bus a car.  I was in a
&gt; hurry and made an error.  I just finished doing the pushrod seals and i
&gt; just finished adjusting the valves.  The good thing is i think it runs a
&gt; little better.  But their is a bad thing that is it still leaks oil. :(  I
&gt; do think that that the seals are holding i put silicon on them.  I think it
&gt; is the valve covers that are leaking but i don't know why.  I heard that
&gt; your not supposed to use silicone so i didn't use anything.  Should i of?
&gt; If i shouldn't use silicone what should i use.  Also a last question is
&gt; that does anyone know where i can get some heater boxes for cheap?  Thanks
&gt; everyone.
