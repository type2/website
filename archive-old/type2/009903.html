Perhaps in the winter, but for hot summer days I prefer to sit under
the awning with:

Summer Slush:

Use one 6 oz. can of frozen lemonade mix, empty into blender.  
Fill empty can with gin, empty into blender.  
Fill blender with ice and blend until smooth.

Pour into large plastic cups emblazoned with your favorite collegiate
emblem.  (Westy tumblers are an acceptable substitute, but awfully
small)

Serves 2.

Administrivial aside:  This thread is pretty close to the limit. 
Please don't continue it after Friday's gone!
