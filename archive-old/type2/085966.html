Subject: Bubbles in fuel filter.

Hi All.

I took my 70 Westy with 1600sp for its first
camping trip of the year this past weekend
to New Hampshire. Ran great, but when we stopped 
to cook up some lunch on Sunday, and I opened the 
engine compartment to check the oil, I saw something strange.
I have one of those glass fuel filters with the replaceable 
cartridges and I noticed that there was a stream of bubbles
running through it. Would this be a vacuum created in the gas tank?
I have the original gas cap on the tank. Is it vented?

Thanks

Jeff.
