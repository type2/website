Subject: Re: [T2] 1978 GE case

GE is just any '78 engine I think.

&gt;Questions...
&gt;Where is the oil coming from that blows up the rear hatch?  (not out of the
&gt;exhaust, I have checked)

Air currents cause anything that comes off the bottom of the bus to be 
sucked upward and deposited on the rear door.

&gt;What causes so much blow by.

Bad valve sealing, bad rings (allowing combustion gases to get into the 
crankcase), the oil breather isn't doing it's job - it's clogged, broken 
piston, piston that is too small for cylinder, bad valve guides, bad cam 
timing thus allowing a valve to be open when the combustion is taking place 
(I doubt this).

Do compression test, vacuum test, and leak down test. Post your numbers to 
the list.
