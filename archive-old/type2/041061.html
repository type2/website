Subject: piston wrist pin questions

hey volks,
i was parusing the archives and found some good tricks
for removing those pesky wrist pins, but i was
wondering if anyone had any tips for installing them
instead of removing them.   will they go in easier
since they will be new pistons (ie. less buildup) or
is there a trick to installing them so i dont damage
anything (road trip countdown coming)   lets hope my
bus depot order gets here by the weekend:)
thanks everyone
