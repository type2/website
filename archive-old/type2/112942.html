William,

If you're talking about West Coast Core, I've seen mixed results from them.

The wrench type at my local VW FLAPS got a type 1 (maybe 1835?) long 
block from them and is very happy.

On the other and, my son bought a 1915 Type 1 long block and it's been a 
pain.  We were getting it ready to go in and found that the distributor 
drive gear was munged and the drive pinion was hanging up.  So we sent 
it back to them.  Two weeks or so later (did I mention my son needs his 
car to go to work 45 miles away) we got it back and in the car.  Now the 
oil pressure gage leaking oil badly.  My son forgot to mention that he 
had also noticed the threads didn't look to good when the engine came back.

I was thinking about getting a long block from them, but changed my 
mind.  Now I think I'll just build it myself.

&gt;since we are on the subject of vendor quality/price/reputation...  have
&gt;any listees heard of west coast machine company located in lancaster, ca.
&gt;granted they do not have the variety that other vendors have, but they
&gt;have some pretty amazing prices and claim to ship all quality european
&gt;repro's. they also charge dirt cheap shipping.
