Subject: Clutch ...

On our 1977 Type II the clutch seems to be dragging even when the pedal is
&quot;To the Metal&quot; and makes 1-2nd changes very hard ..

I vaguely remember someone saying that VW clutches &quot;Go&quot; like this IE:- it's
knackered .. (Whereas I always think of clutches going the other way
IE:-slipping)

As I would not do the clutch myself can the assembled advise .. Is it
POSSIBLE that the clutch is out of adjustment (I guess the wingnut..) or
that the cable is stretched ?    If it is then I'll play silly murfens with
it .. othewise it's off to the garage :)
