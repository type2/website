Subject: Re: [T2] I've had it up to my fuel filler neck with gas
  smell....

how bad was the smell on yours? Mine smells from about 5 feet away, and 15 
feet downwind. I did start it once last week but I'm hesitant to do anything 
at this point.

Mat, just an FYI, I don't know if you know or have a manual...
If you are going to remove the firewall, there are 2 screws screwed into the 
bottom on either side.  You have to get under the bus to get to them.  I 
only tell you this because it took me forever to figure out why mine 
wouldn't pull out.  After bending it, I finally figured it out.. duh!  Good 
luck if you do it (replace filler hose), it's a bitch but well worth the 
improvement in the smell.  Mine is gone.  If you need help with a new hose, 
let me know.  -Chris
