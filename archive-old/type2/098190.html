&gt; &gt; Today's marketplace as far as I can tell offers the following tires,
&gt; &gt; arranged by descending price:
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Bridgestone 603V Highway Rib 185 R 14  Load range D   1855/65 psi...$71 each.
&gt;
&gt; I would not use these!  The RD-603, yes; the 603V, no.  &quot;Highway rib&quot;
&gt; tread designs are mostly used on trailers and are designed for straight
&gt; tracking.  They are not designed for braking, turning, or traction.  This
&gt; may not be true of this tire, but I would still not use them.

RD-603V is a traditional conservative zig-zag groove tread tire.  It isn't
a trailer tire by any means

Here's a picture:

I don't think that there is an RD603 without the &quot;V&quot; suffix.
