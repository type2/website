Subject: 72bus for sale Oakland cheep!

Greetings,

i have a white 72 with a blown engine. needs a good home. i know where you
can get a freshly rebuilt engine for it for 500$ ,same year.  the bus is  in 
alameeda,_dot_ca neer oakland.

it's white and in medium condition. not a junker, but lots of
wear and things like a small crack in windshield. small surface rust but not
so visible.  some damage to drivers front from a meeting with a not very
fortunate deer in colorado.  i'm hoping to get my storage fees back, but
must go soon, so it may be free to a good home, but i need cash very badly.
write soon' i don't have a number so pls. provide.

it's not pretty, but looks o.k., a somewhat respectable ride. the paint is
very oxidized, and the top doesn't pop. many small probs. but got me around
the u.s. for 3 years. for someone who wants a functional camper but doesn't
need to impress anyone.

write asap.

Shawn
