Subject: Re: [T2] Eureka Springs show

let's see... there was

Jen and Mike
very colorful hightop bay camper
Arkansas plate BSK8R

Gary Jarrett (i think... i met too many people at once to know if i have
the names straight)
tri-color (tan, cream and red) split window camper
Missouri plate BSK'TR 
or something like that... don't remember if anyone else had a buskatier
licence plate, but those are the two i remember. i also cant believe
missouri has apostrophes in their lineup. all we get for OK tags is
spaces and a dash. join that list if you like... where are you from? the
buska's are primarily, but not limited to, KS, MO, AR and OK... i think
there are others, but i am not sure where. they dont all list their
locations, but alot of talk is involving the eureka show and BNNA... and
i think the bustoberfest.

if you are not already on the list, check it out... www.buskatiers_dot_org
