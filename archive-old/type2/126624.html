Subject: Re: [T2] If yuo were going to build a 2.0...

Since it's a beetle body, not a bus, you've got much more flexability
in cam choices. You don't have to get a bus rolling so can move the
power band up.

If you're using 66mm crank then I doubt the difference between 94 and
96 pistons would be felt. However, the 96's don't cost much more (if
at all).. ;)

Did you see the ad on The Samba for the 1911 kit?
http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds/detail.php?id=109801

Change the cam, get a Raby DTM cooler, and you'd be good to go. I'd
bet you could hit 100hp there. $2k + the Raby parts would NOT be cheap
though... ;)
