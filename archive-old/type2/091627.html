Subject: Re: [T2] Westy shelf cut-out

[...]
Looking at the wear ring on the floor i would tend to agree with the 
propane bottle theory and that pipe looks like a newer grade of copper 
than what was originally in older buses.  possible they were running a 
dual tank for a while.  Not hard to set up.  Doing something similar in 
my westy right now except i have a small 5 pounder for a backup gas 
supply.  that hole would seem to match a 10 pounder.  a ten pounder 
would have the weight to put that wear ring on the floor.

&gt; It's a good guess.  The propane line doesn't seem right to me either 
&gt; but I have nothing to compare it to at the moment.  Does the gas line 
&gt; look normal in this picture?
