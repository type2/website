Subject: Need work space in NoVA

Hey, listees.  I need to 'drop' the engine in my hightop.   I can't drop the
engine in my driveway because the neighbors are standing guard with a
shotgun if I do any more work outside my garage.  And the hightop can't get
into the garage (hightop  = high; garage = low)

The hightop runs fine, I just need to pull #2 cylinder and check out some
noise (said the bear hunter, optimistically).

BTW, the best piece of camping gear is a 12 gauge, 18 1/2&quot; barrel, five
shot pump shotgun with riot stocks.Yes, it truly does sound different than a
.45 ACP registering a round, and it is effective against small crawling
things, large crawling things and things that growl at you when you are out
at night, answering the call of nature.  (Can't you just see me and my
neighbor facing off at high noon!!  )

And I still need a location for dropping the engine,
