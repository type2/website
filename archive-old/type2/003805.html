Just had to note this to my amazement, called around local today as the '81
needs a new set all round, and Autozone and Advanced both have NEW injectors
now for $29.95 each, an unbeatablde price.  I know I looked about a year
back and they did not have them.  I bought 4, they look gorgeous, can't tell
origin, may be Lucas actually (who Bosch or someone finally bought no?) they
are unlabled but might have an L logo.  They are slightly different in
design from the origionals but will fit and work fine, came with seals
(don't appear the best, but you don't know till you see how they last) and
proper style hose clamps.  And the hose is clearly Conti German FI line so
who knows the whole things may be German origion.  Anyway not Bosch, but not
$60 each.  1 year warranty either place, my Advanced had 8 on the shelf (I
think mid 80's caddies use these or something)  Anyway should fit anything
'76 to '83 air cooled 2.0, shows that it always pays to give these guys a
ring if they are around you, their prices on common mechanical things are
often suprisingly good, and it amazes me what they carry for baywindows now
and then.
