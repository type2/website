&gt; y'all think?  Is it not worth the money (scarce right now) that I'll be

save your time and money, send the engine back and save yourself the
headache.   especially if it is a 2liter engine.
 
&gt; Does anyone have a recommendation on how to THOROUGHLY clean out an oil 
&gt; cooler?  Like, a good method of cleaning out the core?  What type solvent 
&gt; can I put through the cooler to make sure I'm getting everything out?  How 
&gt; do I know I AM getting everything out?

they just use that as an excuse not to back up their joke of a warranty

&gt; Also, are there any &quot;must replace&quot; type things I should do now, w/the motor 
&gt; out &amp; save some time/sweat later?

the engine!

sorry to be such a spoil sport but I wish someone would have warned me
before I let myself get screwed by them.  read the archives or my lawsuit
against them, at District Court of Maryland for Baltimore City civil case
No 0101-0025512-98  (BTW, I won)

you have been warned

Bob
