Hi all -

Just getting ready to run out for a few hours.  Hadn't heard anything back 
on:  1) if someone might have an e-mailable vacuum diagram applicable to '80 
Westy, and 2) whether or not/can I/ should I prime my rebuild before 
attempting to turn over after install (2L FI).

Spent some time today fiddlin' w/tin, hooking up new thermostat (any 
particulars about running the cable to the flaps, i.e. &quot;am I gonna hurt 
it&quot;?).  Doing the oil cooler pressure test this evening &amp; proceeding 
w/attaching the (much, MUCH cleaner) fan &amp; shroud, &amp; the rest of the cooling 
tin.

I couldn't find any VW places or parts stores w/a cold start valve gasket, 
or any gasket material matching the &quot;rubber/cork mixture&quot; gasket that was on 
there.  I just picked up a sheet of some cork-ish gasket material, will cut 
out of that (it's not a fuel leak that worries me so much as the ironic 
nemesis of the air-cooled engine:  'extra' air).

One more thing:  I had to break the clamp off of the old aux air regulator's 
rubber &quot;elbow&quot; to break the little pipe thingy free.  The new one seems to 
fit sufficiently snug/hold the pipe.  Do I need to clamp this?

Ciao for now,

Mark, '80 Westy, &quot;Freedom Enterprise&quot;
