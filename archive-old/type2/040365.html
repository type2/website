Subject: shifting

Hello all you bus type peoples.
I am getting my `74 high-top ready for its summer touring and am still 
perplexed by problems I have getting it into 2nd gear. The darn thing hates 
going into 2nd either up or down shifts. Please someone help..what do I need 
to do ??? Is it in need of a shifter upgrade kit, you know one of those things 
that limits the play in the stick and linkage??? 
Please respond to me personally to reduce the digest's girth....
