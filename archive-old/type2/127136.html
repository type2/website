Subject: RE: [T2] Ignition switch or starter?

Hi,
 
You have classic bus starter system symptopms. The problem is twofold: 
-The bus runs current for the starter solenoid all the way to the ingition switch and back. This is a long wire run, and as the wire and connectors age and corrode, you get higher resistance and less current to the solenoid.
-Solenoids age, and get dirty. Combined with low current/voltage this causes the solenoid not to engage (the starter is triggered by the solenoid).
 
The problem is more pronounced when the engine is hot. The road-side fix is to crawl under the bus and beat on the solenoid (not the stater) with a small hammer or screwdriver handle). This will often loosen the solenoid up. If not, let it cool down a while, beat it, and try again.
 
The long term fix is to install a hot-start relay (see the type2 library or the Muir book). Very easy thing to do. This will allow you to get more life out of your solenoids. BTW make sure you don't ALREADY have a hot start relay installed before you go shopping.
 
Since this problem is partly the solenoid's fault too, you will probably need to replace that eventually. If you have a hot-start relay and the solenoid's acting up, time for a new one.
