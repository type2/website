Subject: A new year is coming

Hi Volks,
   With this being friday, it is appropriate to wish you all a happy new 
year.  Although it's still 1999 as I type, I'm already starting to plan for 
some camping events in the coming year.  I'll probably go to Every Bus 2000 
down in NC during april and would like to find something in MI, near Flint, 
for the summer.  Of course I'm not forgetting about Westies in the 
Woods,Transporters by the Tunnel, Busses by the Trail...... I gotta go add 
up my vacation days.
   Well everyone have a good year.  Your quite a group, as unique as the 
vehicles we drive.  I'm sure glad I found the list, and you.
May the wind be at your back, and the sun shine on your face.

Paul A.
