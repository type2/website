Subject: Re: New smog laws in CA?

&gt;Right on!  Hopefully other places pick up on this.  I think smog testing is 
&gt;ineffective if you can plan on getting tested.  Here in BC everyone has to 
&gt;get checked every year.

Glen,

I agree. The gentleman on the radio indicated (like you) that the current 
method of testing, in effect, creates a system that makes everyone get 
their car up to spec. every 2 years here in CA. Then from the testing 
point on the car's smog spec. degrades until the next  inspection.

&gt;But you always see cars on the road (not just old vehicles like ours but a 
&gt;fair share of 90's cars too) spewing smoke like they got a guy in the back 
&gt;seat shoveling coal into a furnace.

The funny thing was, as I was listening to the original report on the 
radio and inching along in traffic, some guy in a 3 year old Detroit-iron 
truck (not a diesel) started spewing plumes of smoke right into my 
window. Hmmm, says I. I'll bet that when I get my '76 running to spec. 
it'll beat that guy by a mile. So, I guess what it comes down to is 
personal responsibility, but it takes that goverment impetus to kick our 
butt's in the right direction.

cheers,

Bren
