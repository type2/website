&gt;From the data (5.5&quot;, 39mm offset) and (6.0&quot;, 30mm offset), it would seem
that most of the additional rim width goes outboard. More precisely, if my
math is correct, of the additional 13mm, 15 are added outboards and 2 are
substracted from the inside.

Hence it would seem to me that the &quot;correct offset&quot; is simply more of
function of what _fits_ in the wheel wells, rather than being a function of
what is &quot;right&quot; for the bearings. Comments?

I don't think so. A smaller offset brings the rim closer to the center of
the car. So a 6&quot; rim is 13 mm wider than a 5.5&quot; rim. With the same offset
that would bring the nearside of the rim 6.5 mm closer to the centre of the
car. But with a 9 mm smaller offset that bring it 15 mm closer to the center
of the car. The outside however is 6.5 - 9 = -2.5 mm. So also closer to the
car albeit very little.

This probably means that the tire is at more or less at the same distance
from the inside of the outer car body giving it enough clearance.
