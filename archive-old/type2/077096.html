&gt; &gt; Tomorrow I am going to pull that intake and put in a different 
gasket.  I am
&gt; &gt; currently using metal, so i think i will try the paper 
one.......Any thoughts?
&gt; 
&gt; Last time I changed mine I was recommended to use the paper ones.  I 
don't
&gt; have any scientific evidence as to whether they are better or not, 
but I've
&gt; had no problems.

I prefer the thick paper gaskets on my type 1 dual-port.  It seems to 
me that it would be much easier to develop a vacuum leak through the 
metal gasket, particularly after it has been flattened out a while.
