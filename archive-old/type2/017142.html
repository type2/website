&gt; Ok, I sure this has been covered in the archives,but I can't find it
&gt; I believe someone offers the sheetmetal and engine support to put the upright
&gt; into the 72 and later van (Like the european transporter)
&gt; Does anyone have that information handy?
&gt; Also, in the latest VWM mag from the UK they show a *new* Devon camper
&gt; Uses a *new* &quot;1973ish&quot; Mexican bus......(Link-pin front end..with disc
&gt; brakes!?!?)
&gt; Like, you can still *buy* a new bus...
&gt; Who had the vin plates for sale??
&gt; (only kidding, *I'd* get caught, sure as sunshine)

Steve:
They are probably Mexi-buses- basically 73-79 style with an 1800 Golf
water-cooled motor vertially mounted in back, and a Darth Vader-style
nose for the radiator. They perform well and are often seen in the
American southwest. VW de Mexico shows them on its website. $18-19,000,
not cheap enough to warrant interest in doing a &quot;jack up the VIN plate,
change the whole car routine&quot; like Beetlemex does with mexi-beetles.
Believe me, I'd consider using a chassis from one under my 69 double cab
if I could get one into Iowa legally. (I have often referred to my 69
double cab as &quot;the rustiest one still going to work every day&quot;. It's so
rusty underneath that the partition behind the front seats twangs
(oil-cans) driving over irregular surfaces.
