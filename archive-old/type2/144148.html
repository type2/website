Subject: What color is stock?!

Hey guys,

	My wiring is almost done, and I'm starting to clean / paint the underbody of the car. 
In this process, I've been removing the wheels so that I can really get in there.

My plan is also to paint the wheels... but I'm not sure what color to paint them,
or what color they were originally?

If you go to this link: &quot;http://community.webshots_dot_com/photo/70738428/89372699aGjshT&quot;

You'll see a picture of my Bus as it was about a year ago. It more or less looks the same 
except that all the exterior hardware is new, and I've paint-matched the bumpers to the 
white on the roof (GM 1997 Arctic White). 

Now, I want to paint my wheels because the black just doesn't seem to fit. I'm trying to
find pictures of STOCK VW Busses of my year and I can't seem to find any that show 
original wheels. I know that these hub caps were original (in style) to what 
came on my Bus, but how about the actual color of the wheels themselves?

I've seen a couple of pictures where the wheels were actually painted a sort of 
Semi-Gloss grey. (sort of like a medium shade of grey).

And I've seen other Busses where the wheels were painted the same color as the 
body.  I've also seen some where the wheels are painted white?...


Can anyone tell me what color my wheels SHOULD be colored? I've already painted
one of them in Arctic white, but I don't know how well it fits. I'd just like 
to hear from anyone who may have an idea of what is normal / original for a
73 Bus like mine. 

On a side note, I don't think my Bus was supposed to be painted all the way to the roof
line, most of the ones I've seen are painted up to, and just below the greenhouse.



Thanks!
