Subject: [T2] CHT guages or oil temp?

Hello Volks,
Having just pulled apart my 1600 SP and finding cracks in the heads between
the spark plug and valves on both heads I thought I'd better do something to
prevent this from occurring in the future. I use my DC for work and trips to
bus shows so it sees many miles. I thought a CHT gauge would tell me faster
when the engine was getting hot so I could adjust my driving style. Any
suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
