Subject: Insurance info. needed

We've owned a '78 Westfalia for a week now, and we're new to the list.

We found out that it's cheaper to insure our bus with our State Farm
agent if it's registered as a motor home.  The way that they come up
with a premium is based on the price of the vehicle when it was
purchased new.  Our vehicle does not show up in their files.

Does anyone know or know how to find out what a '78 campmobile cost when
it was new?

'78 Westy
'69 Squareback
'67 Fastback (for sale)
