Subject: Re: [T2] electrical woes (turn signal problem)

What year is your bus?


&gt; I pulled a bad flasher (electrical) out to replace it with a new one
&gt; (mechanical (?)).  When I turned on the turn signal w/ the new one.  It
&gt; didn't work properly, and a wire coming from the flasher got real hot,
&gt; smoked a little and i cut the juice.  The same has happened with a heavy
&gt; duty new electrical flasher, it got so hot,the insulation melted off of the
&gt; wire.  The only flashers that have worked have been 1) a 12v electrical
&gt; relay that was on when i got it, and has since quit working.  And 2)a bad
&gt; spare I had which is the mechanical type, a 12V with the number 565.  I've
&gt; tried replacing it w/ the same thing but with the number 550 on it.  The 550
&gt; gets the wire hot. and  they don't function properly.  I have noticed that
&gt; with the ones that don't work right.  You can hear them flashing when no
&gt; turn signal is on.?
&gt; I'm not a smart electrical guy.  And i'm totally baffled. please help me
&gt; out.
