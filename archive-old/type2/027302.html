Subject: ISO 1st vdub bus

hey

im taking the plunge--if i find a reasonably priced kamper in my area (no. 
VA, west MD, near DC).

im looking for a good source for type 2s in my area. i already check the 
want ads and the truck-finder but im hoping there's a more reputable source 
in my area--like a club or some contacts with busses.

any ideas? or does everyone simply comb the want ads?

thanks!

kip
