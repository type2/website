&gt; 4) A type IV short block. Coated with white lithium grease before putting
&gt; away about 2 years ago. Was dreaming of a type IV powerplant for my '71. No
&gt; idea of the condition of the internals, nor mileage.

I need a 2liter block, so if it is still avaliable,  I have been in the
hospital so won't make EB this year but could get to Falls Church in a
couple weeks, I'm in Baltimore

I might have a piece of rear hatch glass would have to check

thanks
