&gt; I've been thinking about making a metal fan guard and powder
&gt; &gt; coating it, as well. Very light welding rod might work. I'd have to
&gt; &gt; set up a buck, weave the wire, solder the intersections, make a
&gt; &gt; ring and tabs, and send it off to be powder coated. Might be a big
&gt; &gt; improvement on (ratty) plastic guard.
&gt; 
   I still think a metal/plastic duct from the fan intake to the air scoops
at the top corners of the engine compartment is good insurance of
fresh/cooler air to the engine. The 411/412 used such a system, IIRC
