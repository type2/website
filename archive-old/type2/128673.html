That's a possibility. When was the last time you had the AFR set on a exhaust gas analyzer? What is heat burning up your heads?

&gt; It seemed like there 
&gt;was a guy on the list named Sammy a few years back who did this.  I'm 
&gt;thinking of a 2.4L CIS engine.

That would be Sam Dakhlia. Last time I asked him about the bus he said his engine was blowing blue smoke.

If reliability is your main goal you could spend a lot less building a bullet proof Type IV motor than the $7K it will cost to rebuild a 911 motor. Call Jake Raby at www.aircooledtechnology_dot_com. He seems to know all of the head upgrades that can be done. He might just point you towards Headflow Masters:
