Rich-
 
           &lt;&lt;According to the vin#, the model year is clearly 1972. I need the             info to buy brake shoes.&gt;&gt;
           
            I gave up trying to identify the exact rear brakes on my 72 Busses. I have brake shoes from the P.O. that don't fit. I took the shoes out and took them to the FLAPS and they had a book with pictures of brake shoes. Found them there, about $23.00/set  as I recall.
