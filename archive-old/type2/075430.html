Subject: Re: [T2] 78 FI Wiring Problem....

Troy:
I'm a little perplexed- there is NO fuel injection  wiring under your dash. The
only thing coming from the front to the back is the one that goes to the hot side
of the coil
(as well as several others not relevant to this subject!). This basically comes
from the ignition switch, and I think it is solid black.

&gt; Hello all,
&gt;         I am in desperate need of your help.  I have a 78 bus that used to run
&gt; fine.  I, without giving it thorough thought, dismantled my dashboard, and
&gt; undid all the wiring.  The were alot of shorts and it was in dire need of
&gt; being rewired correctly.  Well, I got a new job and did not have time to
&gt; finish the job.  I took it to a shop where they were able to succesfully get
&gt; everything back together except for the fuel injection part of the wiring at
&gt; the fuse box.
