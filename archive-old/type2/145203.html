Subject: my bus is finished after 10 months

About 10 or 11 months ago i wrote to the list to tell
everyone that my engine of 7 years not knowing the
history behind it decided to end it's life pistons
valves etc... Well today is December  the 5th and my
mechanic has been driving my bus around for over a
week. He says the bus has been hadling beautiful and
the en gine that boston bob built did a beautiful job
without any problems in fact the oil temperature
sender has been telling him the engine has been
keeping cool. In fact through out all the nasty posts
from previous people saying they are not going to get
a engine through boston bob because of one pssed off
member i knew in my heart that bob builds beautiful
engine. So what i did to my bus and my engine in
total.  powered coated all engine tin sandblasted and
powdercoard my rims silver with brand new tires brand
new german exhaust from my mechanic. Oil temperature
sender to finally check the temp of my oil. Used lined
gas tank my original one was no good. My mechanic had
