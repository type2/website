Subject: Interstate Bus Wrecks

Hi,

Three years ago I was driving the '69 on I40 while returning from a 
camp out. There was a crazy unexpected traffic slow down caused by 
dozens of  Harley's parked in the breakdown lane. I was in the right 
lane when the car in front of me suddenly locked his brakes up while 
going 55 for no apparent (I could see traffic in front of him) reason 
. I hit the brakes, checked the mirrors, quickly turned my head to 
see if I was clear to swap lanes. I was clear for at least 50 or 75 
yards so I swapped lanes. At the time of the lane swap, braking had 
slowed the bus down to about 35mph. I hit the gas but I was still in 
4th gear and thinking how happy I was to have not hit the idiot in 
front of me. Then I heard a squeal, checked the rear view and saw a 
pick truck coming up very fast behind me and trying to stop. I do not 
know where he came from. My guess is he swapped lanes about the same 
time I did.

When the truck hit me I had been in the lane for about 10 or 15 
seconds and had worked my speed back up to about 45 or 50. He must 
have been doing 75 or 80 before he hit the brakes and then hit me. 
Upon impact my glasses flew off my head, camping gear flew forward 
and the bus was launched down the Interstate. I  was able to regain 
control of the bus and pull off the road. The bus was trashed but I 
was alive.  I jumped out of the bus and checked the occupants of the 
pick-up . They were uninjured but the driver was very upset because 
he had just bought the truck which was sporting dealer tags. His 
girlfriend was also pissed about it. The state trooper found the 
driver of the pick-up truck at fault.

The point? Maybe during the period in the mid 70s to the mid 90s when 
the max speed limit on the Interstate was 55mph a bus stood a 
fighting chance with traffic moving at 65 to 70 mph. Today with speed 
limits of 65 to 70mph and traffic typically flowing 80 to 90 mph 
driving a bus on the Interstate becomes a risky endeavor.

In my old 72 I would run with the big dogs at 75. In the '67 and '69 
I would run 65ish and try and stay out of the way. With the '68 I 
give up and make every effort possible to stay off the Interstate if 
I am driving the bus.

Drive safely
Chris
