Subject: Re: [T2] How do you adjust a choke?

Joey,

Adjusting a Weber 32/36 DFAV, from the info that came with mine:

1)  Must be below 20C / 68F.
2)  Make sure throttle is working smoothly.
3)  Choke plate must be fully closed.
4)  Make a reference mark on the choke and carb where their faces meet
before loosening the three 7mm hex head screws.
5)  Loosen the three 7mm hex head screws one full turn.
6)  While holding the throttle about 1/3 open, adjust the closing tension on
the choke plate until just fully closed, then slightly increase the bimetal
spring tension by continuing to rotate the thermostat 3mm (1/8&quot;)  - measured
on the outer diameter of the thermostat.
7)  Tighten the three 7mm hex head screws without distorting the retainer
ring.
8)  Fast idle speed may need adjustment.

That's it.  Once you look at the carb and see what I'm describing, it's
easier to do it than talk about it.  8^)

Good luck.
