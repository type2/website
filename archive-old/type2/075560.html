Subject: Re: [T2] Push Button Starter

I can/have gone cheaper/quicker- on our 71, I got a free piece of 14
gauge house wiring about 5 ft long and pushed it through the grommet
through which the battery wire goes to the starter.  Unhook the upper
starter connector and attach this to the same terminal; I may have
stripped the wire a bit and soldered it, or found a double connector to
get the two on one terminal.  In the battery compartment I wrapped the
free end around the big battery cable so it couldn't touch anything. 
When needed to turn the starter, just touch it to the + terminal.  This
was left in place to do a one man compression check.

 &quot;I would
&gt; go to NAPA and get a pushbutton and 20 feet of 10ga wire and terminals and
&gt; make up direct connections at the starter, just run the wires on the floor
&gt; to between the front seats for the pushbutton. Now I have guaranteed lower
&gt; voltage drop than the old wires/terms to actuate the old starter
&gt; dependably, and have spent only $20/20 minutes.
