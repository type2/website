&gt;I don't either, but couldn't you just get one of those round tanks you see 
&gt;at gas stations and RV places, the kind you swap out when you need it 
&gt;refilled, and mount it under the seat somewhere? Why would you have to have 
&gt;a Westy propane tank?

        Has anyone done this?  If so, how long have you been doing this?  My
real question is, are you; (a) not likely to blow yourself and your van up?
(b) just haven't blown up yet?

        I have those type of tanks, I use them for the stove in my house
(propane delivery is expensive here).  The tanks are left outside and I
plumbed the gas into the kikchen.

        What I am getting at is, the fear factor.  Is having a 3-5 gal tank
of LP in a semi-enclosed area where there is often open flame (my stove, I
open the window when I use the stove though) considered safe?

        I have considered a airtight cooler, mounted and vented to the
outside as a safe way to do this (sleeping with one of those bottles inside
a van dosen't seem safe) has anyone tried this.
