Subject: Re: [T2] UNIDENTIFED BOSCH PART

This is the Pressure Relief Valve for the Air (Smog) Pump.  It is regulated by 
the vacuum pressure from the vacuum &quot;spider&quot; on top of the engine.

I know because I used to have a 73 Panel billions of years ago.

&gt; I BOUGHT THIS 73 BUS WHICH BESIDES HAVING AIR CONDITIONING AND AN AUTOMATIC
&gt; TRANSMISSION IT HAD BETWEEN 2 AND 3 DISSASEMBLED ENGINES IN SIDE THE BUS. i
&gt; HAVE THROUGHT THE HELP OF THE BENTLY MANUAL AND FROMER VW EXPERTS IDENTIFIED
&gt; MOST PIECES TO MY PUZZLE.
&gt; 
&gt; ONE OF THE REMAINING UNIDENTIFIED PARTS IS A BOSCH  0 588 099 004.  IT ALSO
&gt; HAS THE VW PART NO.  021 131 604.  
&gt; 
&gt; DOES ANYONE RECOGNIZE IT?  THE WEB SITES THAT LET ME ENTER PART #S DONT SEEM
&gt; TO RECOGNIZE.
&gt; 
&gt; IT MAY NOT EVEN BE FOR A BUS AS I HAVE FOUND BUG PARTS IN THE MIX I HAVE.
