Subject: need seat belts

Hi. I need the driver's and passenger's seat belts from a late model  
(or vanagon, I guess)- I believe any year will do. I don't need the   
bolts, but do need both the male and female ends of both belts. Cheap 
is the word here, but of course they shouldn't be frayed or bad       
looking. I'm helping someone upgrade to 3 point belts...              
thanks
