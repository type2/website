Subject: Re: [T2] replacing a poptop seal?

Hi Daniel,

I replaced the poptop seal on my 1979, but the 1971 is pretty much the same. 
  Here goes:

1. Pull/tear/mangle off the old seal.  Pliers, screwdriver, and putty knife 
are all appropriate tools.

2. Clean/sand/smooth edge of poptop.  I got mine very smooth with some 
150-grit sandpaper, and touched up and painted any spots on the Bus roof 
while I was at it.

3. Push on new seal.  I had a seal similar to the one you have, and found 
the combination of a small hammer/mallet and the heel of my hand worked 
well.  Start the seal with about an inch sticking over the edge, and cut off 
any excess on both ends when you're done.

That's it!  It's pretty easy, and can be done in about an hour if you work 
fast.  If you have the flat seal as well, Steps 1 and 2 apply.  For 
installation, I used 3M Weatherstrip Adhesive (the yellow stuff) and just 
glued it in place.

Good luck!
