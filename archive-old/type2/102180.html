Subject: Re: [T2] POR15 Undercoat

&gt;This POR stuff is used nowhere, by any vehicle manufacturer, of any
&gt;notoriety, regardless of what shape or form--or for that matter any
&gt;professional body repair / refinishing shops.

     I have always found this a bad reason not to do something.  For one 
thing they may be using a similair compound and cannot call it POR-15 
because that name is owned.  Though I doubt that because they would 
advertise the poo out of it if they thought it was better than what the next 
guy was doing.  But the biggest reason is why should they use a product like 
POR-15 even if it is superior?  They have undercoating and paint, and it 
works, so why should they change it?  ALL car manufacturers go with the 
cheapest method or item that will satisfy the need for the duration that 
they feel is appropriate (usually around the extended warranty date) and no 
more.  If they went to a POR-15 type of solution they would have to re-train 
their sprayers or re-equipe their robots or whatever the heck puts the paint 
on, and they would have to pay for POR-15 which is more espensive.
     POR-15 is great for what it's designed for.  If you use it according to 
directions, with the proper metal prep, it's going to work very well.  If 
you don't, it's not.  Just like any other metal coating or rust inhibitor 
ever created anywhere.  Personally, I think it's about the best thing out 
there if you want to take the time and apply it right.  It beats the hell 
out of undercoating, and is about as good and of lighter weight than the 
truck bed liner products.  That's just my opinion though.
