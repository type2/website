&gt; Still worried about oil pressure though. Took it out for a 12 mile run

I'm running 5-50 synthetic (very thin) in my rebuilt 2 liter after about

it will still be holding 30psi

&gt; meticulous about checking all clearances. Everything seemed well within
&gt; specs. I am wondering about the oil pump though. I did my best to check
&gt; the clearance on it but to be honest I don't know if I did it right. But
&gt; I don't know what to think. When I first start the cold engine I get
&gt; about 50 psi within about 1/2 second of cranking. As the temps climb to
&gt; the operating range the pressure drops. Do you think 40 wt. is worth a
&gt; try? Should I buy a new oil pump? Don't know, Please help. I don't want
&gt; to fry this engine before it is broke in.
