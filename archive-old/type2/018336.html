When I brought the bus home three weeks ago my wife said &quot;great, now I guess
it's going to be grimey fingernails from now on.&quot;

I took the hint and bought a jumbo box of nitrile gloves from Harbor Freight. I
go through two or three pair on a heavy night but they reduce burns, cuts,
abrasions, exfoliations and all kinds of nastiness. They're comfortable and
flexible enough to let me peel the end off a roll of duct tape. Haven't tried
them in solvent but they stand up to gasoline and brake cleaner.

No more black fingernails.
