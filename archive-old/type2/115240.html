Subject: Auto Choke Adjustment

Hey-

Happy Friday!

I have been having a problem getting my bus to idle when cold. It would start
great, but die within a minute or two. This would continue for 7-8 more
minutes. My chokes (on my 34-PDSIT 2,3) were adjusted within the marks. I have
adjusted the chokes about 20deg beyond the marks, and this seems to have
addressed the problem. They still open fully, they just take longer.

Is this going to cause any problems? Am I just hiding some other issue?

Cheers,
Matthew
