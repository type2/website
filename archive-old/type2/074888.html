&gt; Hmm, I says to myself--&quot;musta cooked the trans.&quot; :&gt;(
&gt; Another fine learning experience, in my youth-----


and there just aren't many of those VW auto trannies out there, even if
you don't plan to use the auto tranny have pity on those of us who have
auto tranny buses and may need that tranny at some point!  so be careful
with em they could be the tranny that keeps a bus from going to the

&gt; and EVERY auto tranny that I have had go out has been a failed tranny
&gt; pump. =A0 and it is VERY VERY diffcult to repair/replace as it is all
&gt; the way at the back (front) of the tranny, every other part has to be
&gt; removed.
&gt; wonder how many had been towed in an earlier life.
