&gt; Hiya All,

&gt; So........the speedometer reads accurately at a given speed.  I've checked it
&gt; against the &quot;speedreaders&quot; that the local police set up in the neighborhood.
&gt; The Bus is in stock shape.

I've always thought about calling up the folks in charge of such devices
and asking them if they would please add a third digit to the display so
that I might get an accurate reading of my speed...

&gt; But it seems to be very slow on the uptake and the slow down.  For example, I
&gt; can bring the Duck to a complete stop and the speedo will read 10 or 12 mph
&gt; and still is slowly returning to the peg.  Accelleration seems slow also.

Sounds like you have thick lube on the pivot.  This is a delicate
mechinism, so be careful when working on it.  You might be able to cure
the problem with a single drop of kerosene on the pivot bearing, letting
it soak in to loosen the gunk.
