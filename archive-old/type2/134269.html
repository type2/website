Subject: Bore and stroke dimensions

Hi all,
I have stock bore and stroke dimensions, but what are some common oversizes
(as in larger capacity) for the type 4 motor?
I'm after bore and stroke dimensions please, not just displacement.
When the stroke is increased is the stock crank modified, or are whole new
cranks used?
I didn't find much in the archives on this.
Thanks in advance,
Richard
