&gt;I believe you want VDO part number 360 006.  This part threads into the 
&gt; &gt;engine case where the stock oil pressure sender goes.

Be CAREFUL!  In a Type 4 engine, the sender will fit into the threaded hole 
in the case, but is too big to fit in next to the distributor and cooling 
tin (ask me how I know).  To solve the problem, I used a 3&quot; piece of brass 
pipe and a 90* elbow to get the sender up and over enough to clear.  I think 
I used 1/4&quot; or 3/8&quot; NPT threaded tubing, available for about $3.50 total at 
my FLHS (Ace Hardware).  Bring your new sender along to get the fit just 
right.

You could use a 3&quot; or 4&quot; piece of straight pipe with a female-female 
coupling, but the sender's weight above the engine would act as a pendulum 
and would stretch the case as the engine vibrated.  With my setup, I was 
able to jam the sender against the cooling tin to keep it stationary.  Also, 
you can't use pipe tape to seal it unless you run a separate ground wire to 
the sender body -- the pipe tape is non-conductive.

Good luck...
