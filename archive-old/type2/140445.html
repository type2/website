Subject: Re: [T2] need help - vent windows

&gt;Wow! I have never seen them THAT bad......
&gt;I have heard that they are still available new out of Brazil. But they are 
&gt;not cheap.
&gt;Good used is your best bet. I try to grab all the nice ones I find. I have 
&gt;a couple of pairs of them right
&gt;now. [they are a hot item in Australia. Australian buses came with solid 
&gt;glass]

I'll second that! Yes they are available new ex Brazil, and a bit pricey. 
They look OK, but not the quality of original German ones. I have a received 
number of sets from Karl and all have been great.
BTW Karl, I have seen some much worse than that, but what can you expect 
from bus's that are taken regularly on the beach :)

Regards,
Richard
