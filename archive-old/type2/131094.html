Subject: Re: [T2] Re burnt auto trans and new bus

Looks like the tranny in it is a 030.. and I guess it wasn't the best 
transplant
in with the 2 liter injected as you mentioned.

The shop is going to look for a 010 and see what can be found. Does anyone
know of any that are around.. hopefully in canada? And what price we may
be looking at?

If there isn't anything available he does have a few parts for the older one
and will try and redo what was done, better.

J


well the 2 liter engine was mated stock to the 010 auto tranny not the 003
and the 003 needs the vacuum for shift points that the Fuel Injection does
not normally have provisions for....just a couple points.

good luck
Bob
