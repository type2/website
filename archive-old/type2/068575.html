this is almost certainly the problem.
1)  unplug the wires from the horn (with ignition off so you dont blast your

2) hook up a new wire with a switch or to the button.

b) flickers (indicators) wont work although hazards do. 
Checked the unit which seems fine.

check your fuses and clean all connections.
