Subject: Those hard to find digital oven thermometers

As the subject states I have yet to find a digital oven thermometer anywhere
I have tried Radioshack, Walmart, Canadian Tire, Zellers, and some specialty
kitchen shops.

Any ideas ????

or does anyone know exactly where to get one in there home town I could
make it worth your while to pick one up and ship it to me

Thanks in advance for any and all help
I missed you guys (and gals)    :)
