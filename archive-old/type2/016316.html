&gt; Very true, but how do you get the fuel sender out without pulling the tank?

There is plenty of room to get the sender out without pulling the tank.
You can't pull it straight towards you because of the shape of the tank,
but there's planty of room to bring it around the side... 
It worked fine on my 78, didn't take long at all... The RMMW shows thee
same sender for 73-79, so I'm guessing it's possibble for 73-79 busses.
