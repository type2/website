Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Booster ?

From: &quot;Karl&quot;

&gt;I did a little research on #63...... that is the bushing only for the fresh 
&gt;air line. The fresh air line is
&gt;17mm. The booster vacuum line is 12mm. The rubber sleeves that go in each 
&gt;end of the 12mm &gt;line &gt;do not show up
&gt;anywhere.  There is a black rubber sleeve that goes into the end of 76, but 
&gt;I cannot find it.


&gt; &gt; &gt;There should be a rubber sleeve in each end of the plastic tube. I 
&gt;think it
&gt; &gt; &gt;is #63 in this pic:
&gt; &gt; http://homepage.mac_dot_com/ratwell/Microfiche/t205110.gif


&gt; &gt; Does that mean that it would attach to the nipple on the booster and and 
&gt;#76
&gt; &gt; would go over that?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is there anybody that has replaced these lately or know anyone that might 
supply them? For clarification:

I am looking for the rubber bushings or sleeves that work with the Brake 
Booster Ridgid Plastic Vacuum Lines. 12mm and 17mm.


Thanks,
