Subject: Bay clocks

I am sitting here playing with a couple of bay quartz clocks and I see a big difference between the early grey
face and the late black face. The grey face is dated 4.75, the black face is 12.77.
But that is not the difference......

The black face clocks always kind of annoyed me when I am out in the high desert and it is very quiet at
night. The 2nd hand always goes doh, doh, doh, doh loudly......every second: doh! At 2 in the morning, that is
all you hear in the bus, doh doh doh doh.......as the 2nd hand jerks on each move.

The grey face surprised me. The 2nd hand is a sweep second hand!   It just goes around nice and quiet.......
No stopping and going.
