Subject: Re: [T2] Help - can't get reverse NOT to work..

either your shift plate is on backwards or it is not positioned right?
   
  the little notch on the plate goes ot bottom left (that is reverse...
   
  this is just what it sounds like to me....

  Hi

As I have mentioned earlier, passed test ready to go etc, but one tiny 
problem I can select reverse WITHOUT pressing the gearstick down, it 
just slides right in, this could be problematic at freeway speeds. The 
other gears are all fine if not a bit stirry.

I have replaces all the bushes, clutch etc during the rebuild.

I have checked the shift plate and stick postion as per Bently several 
times? Any ideas???

Thanks
