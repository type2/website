Subject: Re: [T2] continually tight valves

So is bad valve seats the most probable problem? Anything else? I have two 
other heads I could put on, with less than 3000 miles on each. Or should i 
not worry about it and just keep adjuting the valves, maybe more often?

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Recent discussions about torqueing head bolts makes me wonder. Nearly
&gt; &gt; &gt;evertime I adjust my valves, usually 2,000-2,500 miles, they are tight.
&gt; &gt; Like
&gt; &gt; &gt;I can't even get the .006 in there tight. Not always all of them, but
&gt;maybe
&gt; &gt; &gt;6 out of the 8. Any reason why this would be? The SIR ruibld has about
&gt; &gt; &gt;12,0000 miles on it now, but the same was true of my old engine. I was
&gt;told
&gt; &gt; &gt;they would be tight as it breaks in.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     I had tight valves on an engine with brand new VW heads, ended up 
&gt;that
&gt; &gt; the heads had bad seats from the factory.  Had to have a valve job, new
&gt; &gt; seats and new exhaust guides after less than 10K miles.  Been fine since
&gt; &gt; then.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     Anybody else getting bad seats from new Brazilian heads? (1600 DP)
