I'd really vote for repairing the lever if it shows any wear.  The other party in
our 3500 mile lap of Mexico had his break through.  In a fairly rocky spot.  We
took it apart, mounted it backwards and made it home.  A little less overall
travel, but we had freeplay and full disengagement.

&gt; Very good point, Tim! And from my experience, the hole that the clevis
&gt; goes through is usually quite worn, too. A new lever is the easy fix,
&gt; but possibly made from unobtainium! Welding up and redrilling the hole
&gt; round again, will make the clevis and cables last another lifetime. A
&gt; dab of most any grease is a good plan, too, of course.
