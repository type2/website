Subject: Vanagon seats in a 72?

Also found, at the same junkyard, a Vanagon with *mint* front seats. 
Sat in them and instantly I wanted them in my bus.  Enough of the horse
hair, I thought.

	Before I splurge, does anyone out there have experience with installing
vanagon seats in a early 70's loaf?  Looked in the archives but couldn't
find much.  The rails didn't seem to be the same, so before I go
tearin', I'd appreciate any hints or warnings.

Cheers,
