&gt; Trusting your report that the synthetic 5-50 performs well, what are your
&gt; comments about its greater propensity to leak in a VW engine with all those

I have been running Pennzoil Performax 5w-50 for years in my 78 with
2liter engine.  I am very pleased with the performance, however like your
brother in law says, the engine needs to be tight, but it really isn't
that hard, and the synthetic will help you find any leaks in a hurry
