&gt;Its SUPER strong on acceleration, idles really nicely but the above problems are not cool, the cruising seems to be jerky, like its missing or something.
&gt;It has NEVER backfired before, wasnt when I brought it in, so I am wondering what can cause this !?

The surging could be caused by improperly adjusted chokes.  Make sure the choke plates are firmly vertical once the engine is warmed up.
