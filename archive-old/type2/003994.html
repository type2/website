Guys,
I'm just about to replace my air filter on my 75 van, 1800cc, and I leaning
towards buying one of those &quot;washable&quot; air filters, as opposed to a normal
one. Apparently, you can clean the filter whenever it gets dirty. You can
use petrol or similar, to wash out the oil and contaminants, then re-oil it,
and replace it... (I'd be happy to save $$$ on NOT buying new air filters
every time!)

Comments?

Also any suppliers of this product? Please contact me off list.
