To: VW type 2 late aircooled &lt;type2_at_type2_dot_com&gt;
From: Robt Mann &lt;robtm_at_xtra.co.nz&gt;
Subject: Re: [T2] ABS tin?

Mark, dreaming of the next Peregrine, wondered:

&gt;  If VW were designing an aircooled configuration from scratch using 
&gt;up-to-date materials, would the cooling &quot;tin&quot; be ABS plastic?
&gt;
	The desire for 'up to date' in the typical modern corporation 
is iften weaker than the desire to skimp $.04 in the service of 
profit.  The corporation called 'VW' today bears little resemblance 
to the outfit that made our beloved airhowlers.
	I know little of plastics, so I can't judge whether ABS would 
be best for this purpose; but I do think some plastic or other would 
be better, functionally, than the rather unyielding tin.
	What do Lycoming, Continental do for corresp air ducts in 
their modern flat-4s?
