Subject: Re: [T2] Fold down seat strap

Glenn said:


 I got another order from Bus Depot this week and they said that the Loop Straps (221-885-461) that pull the
fold down seat latches are NLA.  Rats, just my luck.  Does anyone know where I can get some?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Are you sure about this part number??

Where did you get it from?

Can you find it here and tell me the frame number and item #?
