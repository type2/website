Subject: Rebuild Gurus Sought

I just took apart a recent &quot;engine rebuilder&quot; rebuilt hydraulic lifter 2.0L
with 6500 miles on it.  Reason for this premature teardown is to
troubleshoot a clattering noise inside the engine somewhere that sounds
like a collapsed lifter, but I believe is not.  The engine also exhibited
fairly low compression (110, 100, 105, 95, engine warm, throttle open,plugs
out) for a recent rebuild.

question 1.  how well aligned are the rocker arm tappets and valve stems
supposed to be?  Looking down from the top of the engine, #2 exhaust seems
to align well with the valve stem, but #2 intake tappet connects the valve
stem on well to the right of center;  #1 intake tappet is fairly centered,
but #1 exhaust tappet contacts the valve stem to the right of center,
though not as offset as #2 intake.   Will this result in abnormal wear in
the valve guides or seats??

Question 2.  The top two compression rings on my pistons appear rough on
the top sides where they contact the sides of the groove in the piston,
almost like hammered metal.  This does not seem normal.  I would expect to
see a smooth surface.  Anyone have any ideas what would cause this?  These
were Brazilian Mahles.

question 3.  Does anyone know where to get German Mahles pistons/cylinders?

Question 4.  What color is the &quot;overheat indicator&quot; button which engine
rebuilders install in the case supposed to read if the engine has not been
overheated?  What color if overheated?

I broke this engine in meticulously, and never abused it or overheated it
as far as I know.  My oil temp gauge gets up to 230F max on the highway
during the summer.  All tin was sandblasted, painted and in good working
order at rebuild.  Thermostat worked properly and engine seal was in place.
Doesn't seem like I should be running into these types of problems (low
compression, clattering noise) so soon.

All advice is welcome.  Please respond via pmail since I haven't had the
time recently to keep up with my list reading.
