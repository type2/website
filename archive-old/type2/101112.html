Subject: Re: [T2] Pertronix report

Richard,

I called them at one time on the fact that the dwell seemed to be set 
high and I couldn't get it to change by moving it around.  They said that 
it would not make any difference and should be right where it was.

Something having to do with the way it works(electronically).


Never had any trouble either(type1 engine).

If it drives good and the timing is right on,....leave it!

Cheers, dave

&lt;snipped for brevity&gt;

The plastic feeler gauge they give you seems to set the dwell on the high
side.  My first try resulted in 54 degrees.  I found this URL that 
suggested
using a larger feeler gauge to get the dwell right (Ken's Buggy Barn):
