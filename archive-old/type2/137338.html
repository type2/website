Subject: upper bunk for a 73 westy?

I have though about switching my upper bunk from a cot to a padded bed several
times over the years, but never tried it. I know that one of the list members
has done this, so I know it can be done. As I was surfing the samba last month
I ran across this ad.
http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds/detail.php?id=119376 I emailed the
seller and they said that it was indeed for a 73. I thought I was pretty sure
that the 73 never came out with a foam bed for the upper bunk, but maybe I am
wrong. Can anyone verify if this is an option on a 73 or if this setup would
work in my 73? They also said that they have all the brackets needed to mount
it.


Thanks,
Corbett
