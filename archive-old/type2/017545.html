&gt; hi , not sure if this is correct way to ask a question... but here goes....
&gt; I found a sink cabinet that someone had tosssed-- still with sink, and
&gt; pump, water tank (dirty0, and ice box (also dirty) in it.  I want to remove
&gt; the water pump near sink and install it in my 70 westy.  But am not sure
&gt; what else I need to hook up-- i saw several pipes near by.  Also, any idea
&gt; of best way of cleaning the tank... not sure what's been in it.
&gt; thanks!

Wes:
The old-time standby for cleaning and sanitizing potable (drinkable)
water equipment is bleach. It's also real good at removing mold and
fungus. Restaurants use bleach and water in spray bottles to sanitize
everything. Just regular Hy-lex (not fresh scent) or generic. I know of
no reason that you couldn't just flush out the tank with that.
