Subject: Combi? and introductions

&gt;&quot;Combi&quot; or &quot;Kombi&quot; means that it is a hardtop van &gt;with two bucket seats forward, and a three seat &gt;bench in the very back, leaving a large cargo
&gt;space in the middle. (People and Cargo=Kombi). 

Not exactly Rev,

Kombi means more specifically a vehicle with a vin# starting with the three numbers 23X, X being the last digit of the model year. 

Kombis became campers, for the most part, also ambulances, fire trucks, basic passenger busses (panel vans too?).

A 22X bus would be a vehicle destined for passenger service only, and likely a deluxe.

Has nothing to do with number of seats upfront, early bay kombis had benches too.

Has nothing to do with rear seats either. It's a body style, platform, etc., not an accessory designation

Later,

Billy
