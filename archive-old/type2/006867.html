Subject: H4 Headlight Conversion

Hey all!

I ordered the H4 knock-off headlights that Ron at BusDepot mentioned a
few weeks back and just got them installed -- WOW what a difference!

I re-wired the headlight circuit to take power straight from the
battery. I ran two 10 guage wires, one each for the high and low beam. I
also ran a 10 guage wire back to the battery ground.  I mounted a fuse
block on the l/h wheel well (in the engine compartment and ran the two
hot wires from it. Mounted on the l/h head light bucket, behind the kick
panel, are two 40 amp relays. One for the low beam one for the high
beam. They are switched by the original power from the switch
(yellow/yellow-black and white/white-black). I cut the original wires
where they enter the l/h headlight and combined  the left and right to
be the switching connection. Then combined and attached the other loose
end to the power out connection. I connected the new ground as well. 

This follows the recomendations found at the following link:
