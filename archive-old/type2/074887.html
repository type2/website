Subject: Re: [T2] another emissions question

I have run my other vehicles though and they run them for 5-10 minutes. I am just worried about my bus. I was
there with my F*rd a couple of months ago. Until Bob's post I never thought about that damn fan! On another note
I went through inspection with a friend and his single cab(they check safety not emissions). The inspector looks
underneath and while knocking on the heater box says,&quot; cool, duel cat converters&quot;.

&gt; &gt; I never took my bus through the CT inspection because it's over 25 years old.  As I recall, the dyno test takes less than one minute.  I doubt that your engine would overheat in that amount of time.
&gt;
&gt; CT and MD sound pretty close to identical, the machines/operators give you
&gt; an automatic second chance if you fail right away...I timed the car in
&gt; front of me and he  was in there on the rollers for over 5 minutes and
&gt; varying RPM.
