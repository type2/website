Al Brase says:
&gt;
&gt; 68-69 mirrors mount lower and have a rubber buffer against the
&gt; windshield, maybe 2&quot; lower.
&gt; I've got a couple of NOS ones around somewhere.
&gt; I'd also agree that you need to have your rear torsion bars set up a
&gt; little.


But, alas, they do not fit in '71, '72, '74 or '79 Type IIs.
I dont know about other years, those are the only ones
I checked. I have a really nice one I grabbed for $2
to put in my '71, but it just wont go. Too small.
