With the recent thread on tires I decided to take a good look at mine
and
I'll probably replace them before the end of summer.

My stock wheels are pretty rusty. I thought about getting these
sandblasted
then painted, but wonder if it would be quicker/cheaper just to go to a
junk
yard and try to find some in better shape and have tires mounted to
them.

What is a good price for wheels at a junk yard? Are there any better
looking
ones from other vehicle makes that fit? Anything to be on the lookout
for? I
see in various catalogs I can get new ones for about $25-30 each.

I went to &quot;Bud's Bugs&quot; in Concord, CA (a salvage yard) and bought a set
of wheels for $10 each, then sent them away to be sandblasted and
POWDERCOATED black. (Powdercoating is helpful mainly for the 'Nyeh,
nyeh, nyeh!' factor).
I did them in black, they look swell. I can now thumb my nose at others
with impudence. Don't ask what it cost.
However, I am gaining karma points by handing off my old set of rims to
a buddy with the strict instructions that, when these 'old' wheels are
sandblasted and painted, he pass along HIS wheels to a buddy so that WE
ALL GET A SET of newly painted wheels. So I ate the initial $40. No big
deal.
