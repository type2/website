&gt; Ok, here is the problem.  My
&gt;78 bus has the original factory a/c, which worked fine last summer until
&gt;the belt broke.  I have the bus in the shop right now getting some
&gt;engine seals replaced and I had asked them to please put on a new belt. 
&gt;The owner of the shop calls me yesterday and tells me that in order to
&gt;put a new belt on he basically has to rip the whole engine apart and it
&gt;will take something like 30 hours of labor and cost LOTS of money and
&gt;that he is not doing it.  My question is: is replacing this belt really
&gt;that hard?  This guy is not my regular mech but he, like my regular
&gt;mech, is a VW specialist and I know so little about the workings of my
&gt;bus that I need some advice. 

Wow, a working A/C!.  How lucky some people are!  First of all your unit is
dealer installed rather than an actual factory unit and your unit may not be
exactly like mine.  However, if it is like the one on my 76 Westy deluxe
then you can get to the belt in about an hour or so.  Removing the
compressor is usually the first thing I have to do whenever I remove the
engine.  The long bolt across the top of the bracket is removed and a couple
of 13mm nuts at the bottom of the compressor are removed and it slides out.
I lay it in the auxillary battery area to get it out of the way.  DO NOT
remove the hoses.  You then simply need to remove the engine tin, front of
the fan shroud, and fan.  You may have to remove or unbolt the alternator,
but I simply can't remember off the top of my head. Even if you do, it is no
big deal.  There is a belt pulley behind the fan that you loop your belt
over then thread the belt over to the compressor.  You then begin to
reninstall everything.  The bottom of the compressor has shims that allow
for enough slack to install the belt then replace the shims to tighten the
belt.  Most of the dealer installed A/C units I have seen look very similar
and I can't imagine a VW mechanic that couldn't do this job in 2 hours.
Good luck.
