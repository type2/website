Hello All    Has anybody out there dealt with this company before? I have a 
customer that bought a new 1.9 diesel motor from them, plus injection pump 
and all the parts needed to install in a westy Vanagon. First thing I see on 
the invoice is the line saying  &quot;as is&quot;  Also  theres a core charge on the 
new engine and pump.Why would this be if they are new? Just wanting to know!  
Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  salem Import service salem Va
