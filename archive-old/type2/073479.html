Subject: Any East-Coasters going to Busses by the Arch?

I just purchased a transaxle for my bus from a kind East-coast listee.  The
tranny is currently in the Washington D.C. area.  Any chance that there is
someone from that area that will be attending Busses by the Arch near St.
Louis over Labor Day weekend?  If so, I can offer all the Sam Adams you can
drink for the weekend, plus loads of good busma in exchange for
trans-porting the trans-axle.  I'll even help with gas money!  Failing
that, if there is anyone that will be attending both the high country event
and BBTA I can arrange to have it at the former.  Any leads appreciated,

-David (with bus in need of taller ratios)
