&gt;Just bought another Westy, '71, and the speedometer works but wobbles
pretty bad.  My '73 Westy does not have this problem.  How do I fix it?

Before fixing anything, jack up the driver front wheel, remove the hubcap,
and spin the wheel.  The end of the speedometer cable is secured with a
little circlip to the grease cap on the hub of this wheel.  Observe whether
or not the cable is secured where it should be, and that it turns along
with the wheel.

I once had the square hole in the grease cap get worn out enough it allowed
the speedo cable to stop spinning, and for several days prior to the end
failure the speedometer wobbled wildly as you describe.  I did a temporary
fix by putting a very very small sheet metal screw in the hole to secure
the speedo cable, then later replaced the grease cap.
