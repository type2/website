Subject: Re: [T2] Re: T2 tools is tools

&gt; you are using rosin core solder? Acid core is for plumbing and will
&gt; cause problems if used in an electronic application. Third, line
&gt; everything up, build a jig to hold the batteries, or get a third hand,
&gt; and do it quick!  The wee bit of extra solder on the pre-tinned tabs
&gt; will let you know when it melts by moving slightly. Hobby supply stores
&gt; or Radio Shack should sell tabs designed for this. Hope this helps, Timo

what just occured to me is that a eutectic core solder might do the trick.

i have some just for soldering the leads of fostex headphones. copper wire
to aluminum. its nasty stuff though.
