Subject: RE: [T2] AIRS request


&lt;snip&gt;
Regardless of whether the lady knew the bus had trouble when she left, how
can anybody justify continuing a long trip in such a fashion once it is
known that there is trouble?  Should anybody really expect other people to
look out for them when they are taking measures like this?  This is why I
don't much like the AIRS list.  I mean, if somebody with a decent VW with no
known trouble breaks down, then sure, I'd like to help them once.  But
having trouble hundreds of miles from the destination means you stop and get
it fixed, and probably pay for it.  I can't get much charitable feeling for
somebody who is driving on old clunker bus across the country when they
could have bought a 92 Toyota for the same amount, I mean, come on, this
life ain't Disney World!  Love your bus, but be realistic.  I'll save my
charity for the starving people in the third world.  Of course I am glad she
made it where she was going okay.  FC

&lt;/snip&gt;

&lt;rant&gt;
I thought the point of AIRS was to carry on the spirit of volkswagendom,
which means that you are charitable.. I mean how many ohter vehicles do you
see owners waving to each other with knowing little winks?

The point is to give what you can for the greater good, while somewhat
sacrificing self. Maybe someone on AIRS has enough money to keep an extra
engine lying around for someone who breaks down. That is their perogative
right?

If someone broke down in my neck of the woods I would certainly help them
with whatever was in my means. It is somewhat a charity and it is about a
spirit of comradarie.

My only hope is that the certain someone recieving help is also giving back
into the system and not just sapping it.
&lt;/rant&gt;
