Subject: Re: [T2] Sacrilidge, Subaru Ea-81 into 78 VW Bus

From: &quot;Mark Dominesey&quot;

&gt; OK, I am ready for the flack, bring it on :)  I am
&gt; seriously thinking about putting an Ea-81 into my 78
&gt; van as I am tired of the analog computer always
&gt; fubaring the fuel injection in it.

Please explain, I have found the fuel computer to be almost bullet proof. 99%
of any failure I have seen has been because water got in them, usually after
someone thought they were doing a good thing by having their engine
compartment steam cleaned.
The other 1% failure was on my 77 Westy. I developed a cold running problem
that had me buffaloed for over 3 months. If I started the bus on a cold
morning and immediately took off, I had lack of power and no acceleration for
about 2 blocks, then it ran normal. If I let it warm up for 5 minutes, it ran
normal. Tested and retested everything. Nothing out of spec or out of range.
Finally, on a SWAG*, I put another ECU in it. That corrected the cold running
problem. The bus never showed any other symptoms, ran the same warm with
either ECU.
If you are having a high failure rate of ECU's, you either have something else
taking them out or a ground problem.
