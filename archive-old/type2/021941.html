I am selling my 71 westy.  I am in Southern California.  Here are the
details:

Westfalia.  Great condition.  Perfect dash with original radio.  New tires,
wheel cylinders, calipers, brake lines, tires, cv-boots, carb, heads, top
end rebuild, exhaust, new vdo oil pressure and temperature gauges, zero rust
except by battery tray, camper interior in great original condition and lots
of extra parts.  At the moment I have a sunroof on the bus but I still have
the pop top as well.  Currently my reliable daily driver.  I am asking $3500
obo.  Please let me know if you are interested.  I am broke and need the
money : )  Mail me for my home or work phone if you would like to ask me
questions.

Thanks,

Justin
