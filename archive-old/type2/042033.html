&gt; Gentlepersons- I've decided to chamge the cover on my front mounted spare tire
&gt; on my bay. For obvious reasons, I've been intrigued by one I've seen on other
&gt; vans (not VW's), and I've looked through a few RV sites but to no avail...Does
&gt; anyone out there in ether- land know a source for a &quot;Roman Wheels&quot; spare
&gt; cover, or even just the logo. Thanks in advance. Tony Roman(see what I mean?)
&gt; in NJ 

Tony Roman, go to an RV store--one you have to walk into--and ask there.
