&gt;I'm following the Bentley procedure to remove the engine out of my 71 Westy
&gt;to replace the heads with rebuilt ones. I've done the procedure except for
&gt;the removing the bolts and dropping the engine.
&gt;
&gt;I don't understand when the Bentley says the upper bolt on the right, what
&gt;is it talking about.

possibly the bolt above the starter? behind the fan shroud in the engine
bay, and above the starter 'round front you've got nuts and bolt.

&gt;
&gt;All I see is the thingy (don't know the name) that supports the heat
&gt;exchangers, is that all thats supporting the engine??

how'bout mustache bar?

&gt;
&gt;I do know to support the tranny before the removal.

well that's key. nice.
&gt;
&gt;I disconnected the accelerator cable with by loosening the 8mm nut but it
&gt;seems that it will catch on the fanshroud?

does it? don't let it. carb goes; accelerator stuff stays

&gt;
&gt;Also like i pulled the fuel line but it doesn't really bend out of the way
&gt;with the engine in, is that something you bend out of the way after you roll
&gt;the engine back a tad.

could...mine has a flexi fuel line front of the wall (wall beyond the fan
shroud) and it makes for enough movement so i don't have this issue. one
thing, you could disconnect the fuel line from the &quot;front&quot;  !find the
flexi!  and drag the metal line with engine extraction.

&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance and I would appreciate any and all tips for this. I have
&gt;been dilligent in labeling all hardware and wiring.

me too, then i have a homebrew. stay in tune,  - steve
