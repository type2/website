Subject: [T2] 71 Bus Voltage Regulator

&gt;Steve are you sure it's a battery drain or a non charging generator?
&gt;I've found that the regulator has been replaced with a bug one instead
&gt;of a 38 amp bus one and that shortened its life.

I just got a new voltage regulator for my 71 bus. It doesn't say anywhere on
it what amperage it's rated for. Can anyone tell me the part number for this
beast?
The part number for the one I have is: Bosch 0 190 350 063-740

Thanks!
Jim Kirk
