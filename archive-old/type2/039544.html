Subject: Ignition troubles - Hall unit?

It finally happened: after a year of intermittant starting problems, my
'79 Westy (California model, electronic ignition) won't start at all now.

The old symptoms were as follows: often in damp weather, the bus had a
tendancy to stall immediately after a successful start.  Then, it would
not start again unless I waited about 15 minutes.  It was impossible to
troubleshoot since the problem would correct itself so quickly.

The other day it was damp and rainy.  Started the bus, made it a block
away from home, and it stalled.  Again, it would not start.  It has now
been two days, and the problem is no longer self-correcting.  In a way,
I'm kinda glad - now I can really fix this annoying problem.

OK, here's what I've found:
1) No spark from the coil.  Coil is new (I had replaced it a few months
ago, since I thought it was the culprit.)
2) There is 12V at terminal 1 of the coil.
3) Went through the Bently diagnostics for the Ignition Control Unit
(Section 20.2, page 78.)  Step 5 of the test failed: voltage did not drop
when the jumper to the center terminal of the 3-point plug on the
distributor was removed from ground.
4) Replaced the Ignition Control Unit ($60?!): still experiencing the
starting problem - no spark.

Questions:
I now suspect that the Hall sending unit is faulty.  (grumble, grumble.)
Anyone ever replaced one of these before?  Any info that might be helpful?
(Bently has no info on this.)  Would it be easier to just get a rebuilt
distributor?

Looks like Hall units are $100 at the FLAPS, comparable to other prices
I've found.  What a pain!  It figures, of the three components of the
electronic ignition (coil, control unit and Hall unit) I had to replace
them all before finding what was really broken.  Too bad Bently gives NO
information about this part, &quot;The Hall sending unit cannot be tested
with common workshop equipment.  So if the unit is suspected of a
malfunction, replace it.&quot;  Great.  Anyone ever revert from electronic
ignition back to old style? ;)


Thanks for the support,
