Subject: Bn4 manual on line

I received the copies of the manual from Brian Hoover - thanks! So when you
are viewing remember I am scanning copies! I made a few changes. I detest
manual web pages where I have to return to the main page to go to the next
page. So each page should have a previous next and index at top and bottom
of the page. I also get frustrated looking at diagrams with labels on the
next page so, where I could I combined them. Please check this out at

Any feedback is appreciated. All the pages except the last few that are
templates were scanned in at 200% so that they were more readable. The
latter were scanned in at 100% to keep the dimensions correct.
Speaking of correct dimensions, what I have left to scan are templates that
are bigger than the 8.5X11 scanner I have. Any suggestions about how I may
go about getting these on line?

Finally, these pages are on an old PC that I use as a web server. Sometimes
I will shut it down over night but for the most part I will just leave it
on. It is not as stable as my Macs (sorry couldn't help myself) but if it is
off line and you *really* need it, just e-mail me mkullman_at_pacbell_dot_net
