Subject: Free Bus in Utah

Gretings List,

FREE! FREE! FREE!

I have a left over bus from my project that I need to get rid of this week. 
If it is still around by the end of the week I will be forced to send it to 
a bad, bad place.

The bus is in LOGAN, UTAH north of Salt Lake about an hour and a half.

It is a '79 Sagegreen Westfalia. Pretty much a rolling shell.

It has all the glass and doors, the gas tank, the luggage rack, and bumpers. 
  Plus other stuff like a dash. It has surface rust and a bit more than 
surface rust in the usual rust prone areas. Nothing too bad however. I've 
seen a lot worse on the road and a lot worse brought back to life.

It does NOT have a poptop, nor much of an interior. Plus, no engine or 
trans. (I used them on my project)

I will have photos of it by this time tomorrow. I drove it often over the 
last five years or so and disabled it last October.

Use it for a body transplant or for body parts. One small dent in the front 
of the drivers side door that also went a slight bit into the edge of the 
nose. The nose portion was fixed.

I have the title.

FREE

email me off list.

Brandt
78/79 Sagegreen Westfalia
