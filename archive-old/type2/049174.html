Subject: Re: [T2] question on welder

T. Nguyen sends:

&gt; Has anyone use a stitch/spot timer kit on their welder? What does it do?
&gt; Does it make the welding easier? Looks better? I have owned a Lincoln
&gt; 100 for 2 years, and yet to master the welding like in the books. I saw
&gt; this as an accessories on the Lincoln and was wondering if it is worth the
&gt; money.

It's used to make (ta da!) stitch and spot welds, which are very short
welds. Very specialized stuff--if you don't have the MIG conversion kit, get
that; if you do have it, next time you get inert gas ask for &quot;trimix&quot;
instead of &quot;MIG mix.&quot; MIG mix has argon and carbon dioxide in it; trimix has
argon, carbon dioxide and helium. Trimix is more expensive yet is easier to
use.
