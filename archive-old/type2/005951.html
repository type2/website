Subject: tires for 74 westy

I'm getting tires for my 74 westy tomorrow.  Local dealer (small town) only has C or D rated 185r14 tires in a &quot;for trailer use only&quot;.  I've been using a 205/75r14 passenger tires on my 75 transporter with no handling problems, but I thought the C or D rating would be better with the heavier camper.  Does anyone know what makes &quot;trailer use only&quot; tires different from others?  Going camping Saturday (maiden voyage under my ownership), and existing tires are dry rotted, so I will be buying one or the other.  Thanks for any advice.
