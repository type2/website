&gt; Ok, REALLY off topic, sorry.

&gt; When on our trip from San Francisco to Glacier to Banff in Canada, the
&gt; middle of nowhere border crossing east of Glacier national park was a real
&gt; PITA.

If it makes you feel any better, my wife and I were hassled at that same
border crossing, but at the time we were riding a full-dress BMW touring
motorcycle, wearing color-matched helmets and riding suits.  We were as
far from being &quot;outlaw bikers&quot; as you could get, but we were given the
full treatment.

&quot;What is the purpose of your trip&quot;
What we thought:  &quot;to abuse your socialized heath system!&quot;
What we said:  We're going to Banff, to see Lake Louise...&quot;

&quot;How are you going to pay for food and lodging?&quot;
What we thought:  &quot;By bumping off liquor stores!&quot;
What we said:  &quot;With this Visa card, just like all the other tourists&quot;

&quot;Are you bringing any pepper spray or handguns into Canada?&quot;
What we thought:  &quot;With carb cleaner, who needs pepper spray?&quot;
What we said:  &quot;No.&quot;

Fact is, they were bored and decided to have some fun with the tourists.
That was the only time they've gone beyond the stock &quot;pepper spray and
handguns&quot; question with us in a variety of vehicles.

Driving a bus means that you might be viewed as less than respectable.
That's just a fact of life.
