Thank you for your comments on top end speed for the type 4 type 2. The
mention of operating temperature is good. My question was originally posed
from the standpoint of exceeding the mechanical limitations. But the thought
of dropped seats doesn't enthrall me, either.

I live in the San Francisco Bay area. On a warm day (as today was) at highway
speed (55 - 75 mph), full or nearly full throttle and any load results in
knocking (pre-detonation). My initial solution was to check the timing (which
I had originally set at 7 degrees BTDC). After making sure the dwell was in
tolerance, I reset the timing to 5 degrees advanced which alleviated the
problem some, but not enough. As this is a relatively low-compression engine,
I had been running 87 octane. I changed to mid-grade and that helped a little.
Still on warm days like today I have to run at reduced power to avoid
knocking. An underpowered vehicle at reduced power is no fun! But I don't want
to thrash my engine, either.

The problem only seems to occur at highway speeds (and rpm's). Perhaps the
distributor is over-advancing....

I suppose I could go up to premium gas, but I don't really think I should have
to (...not to mention that mid-grade has already hit the $2.00 mark around
here and premium is even more.)

Any suggestions?

&gt; I think 75 is the top I would go. I usually drive my '76 auto at 70 on the
&gt; freeway, but it tends to get too hot at that speed (you DO have an oil temp
&gt; right? If not GET ONE! Cheapest insurance you can get). On a war day I have
&gt; to drive 65 or so, and that's WITH an external oil cooler and fan on it.
