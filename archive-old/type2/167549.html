Subject: Re: [T2] Heater Box Header Pipes

&gt; I have removed the sheet metal and die cast fins from my heater boxes and now
&gt; I'm running the header pipes only.  I have an exhaust leak where the header
&gt; pipes connect to the heads.  I'm going to remove the header pipes to
&gt; investigate their condition.  Maybe I'll get lucky and only need to replace
&gt; the copper header gaskets.  Does anyone know if/where type 4 header pipes can
&gt; be purchased?

if you find a place let me know, I am using header pipes on my 78 and had
to make them by stripping the fins and tin also
