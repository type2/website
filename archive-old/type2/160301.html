&gt; Speaking of tires :-)
&gt; 
&gt; I'm looking for contributors to my tire photo article:
&gt; 
Wish I had a photo of the tire I helped a guy change
this mornin'...
Nice lookin' M-B CLK with BLING BLING 21 inch rims
and tires that looked about a foot wide and two 
inches deep...He'd hit a pothole and the tire had
split for about six inches right at the bead...There
were two spacers on the wheel to get it to fit the
M-B and special lugbolts to hold it on...But boy,
was it chromey...The outside at least...The in-
side of the rim was totally corroded...I asked him
what he paid for 'em and the answer was...
$1100.00 per corner for the tire and rim... ;-(
