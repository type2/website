Subject: Re: [T2] How long to run bus to charge a battery?

Get a new battery. You can't leave them unattended for that long and not permanently damage them.

&gt;Do you think it's toast? Or should I have to run the
&gt;bus much longer to get the battery charged up from
&gt;zero.

Alternators are not designed to recover batteries with extrememly low charge. I wouldn't do it.
