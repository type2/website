Subject: Re: [T2] '77 Westy Bad fuel pump?

Yes, it should run continously.  Just yesterday I was pressing the flap
open to keep the pump going to hold pressure.  Then I would test the
injectors.  It's a much easier way than cranking the engine to get the
pump to turn on.

I would check and clean all the contacts involved.  I would highly
recommend using CAIG's DeOxit and ProGold to clean and restore all the
contacts.

later,
Mike

&gt; flow meter designed to turn off the fuel pump when the engine is not
&gt; running, but, the pump doesn't operate every time I do this. Seems to me
&gt; that when the contacts in the air flow meter are closed the pump should run
&gt; constantly with the key &quot;on&quot; and the engine off. Am I right or am I wrong,
&gt; anyone know?
