 There is just no way around verifing numerous functions. Just be sure of
 ignition system items before moving on to FI diagnosis.

I want to second this.  Just helped a fellow with a 79 FI'ed.  Crank but no 
start.  Visual inspection is not good enough.

We popped the distributor cap.  Owner had just replaced cap and rotor.  I 
said what about condensor and points.  No.  Looking at points, noticed points 
weren't opening at all.  So we go to adjust, and the points wire broke in 
half.  Just by looking you would not have known(points looked shiny new).  By 
inspecting further it was obvious the points were the problem.

Inspect carefully(replace if nec.) ignition system then go from there.

Good luck
