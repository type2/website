Subject: radio, install

I'm planning to remove the PO's am-only blaupunkt (spelling?)
radio from my '82 vanagon and replace with an am-fm-tape-playing radio 
and need to know if there are any tricks to installing same. I note that
Joel has written something about getting to the aerial and this is duly
noted.  Any other tips or warnings?  Thanks, Art
