&gt; She's leaking oil, runs kind of rough, and has lots of duct tape on bits of
&gt; the engine. There are even hoses that don't seem go anywhere. I had such
&gt; high hopes when I bought her, but now I'm almost ready to cry.

one of the hoses should go to the tranny should be a port on the drivers
side of the tranny

don't forget to drain BOTH the auto tranny AND the final drive.  take out
the four bolts on the corners of the flat pan on the bottom, remove the
fill tube.  inside you will find a &quot;comma&quot; shaped metal plate about 4
inches by 7 inches or so there are two screws holding this on remove this
as it is the filter, clean and replace, same with the pan, refill with
good quality DEXTRON (I use synthetic)   there is a large allen socket on
the side and another on the bottom of the final drive between the
axles.  take the plug out the side, then the bottom plug when drained put
the bottom one back in and fill it with a good 80-90 weight gear oil (GL-5
will not hurt an automatic final drive) fill it until the oil just runs
out the plug on the side were you fill it. 
  put the fill tube back on, put in about a quart and a half of Dextron
then turn the engine on, put your foot on the brake, shift into each gear
for 5-10 seconds each then put it in NEUTRAL not park leave the engine run 
and check the dip stick, the lines are a pint apart not a quart.  

fill to between the lines, over filling it will leak over into the final
drive.

&gt; Not afraid to get dirty, just don't know where to start, 

count on getting dirty  ;8*}
