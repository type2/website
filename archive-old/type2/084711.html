&gt;The best I get is around 14. I'm hoping that's attributable to the lighter air

Well John says it is, so there you go.  :)  Anyway I wouldn't worry so much 
about how much vacuum you see at idle (within reason).  It's influenced by 
so many things - timing makes a huge difference as does idle speed, 
camshaft profile and compression ratio.  14 sounds in the ballpark to me.
