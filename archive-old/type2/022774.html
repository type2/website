Hi all, 

A few weeks ago a posting was made on the list about the heat, noise and rust
site that had recently gone on-line.  I just want to say, this is an
incredible source of inspiration. I people haven't viewed it yet, they really
should!

After a couple of weeks grimy work, I have &quot;sound proofed&quot; the engine
compartment where it intrudes into the van, the sliding door, the panels
opposite, and the cab doors, also some of the flooring.

I took the van out for a test run today and the difference is incredible, the
engine actually sounds further away, no more of that metal vibrating in unison
with the engine, my hifi can be quieter and i now need to listen hard to
'feel' the revs as i change gear.  So what if it's not stock! this bus is so
different now, and i have the added peace of mind that only totally rust
treated and proofed interior panels can bring.

I'll be fitting a &quot;new&quot; recon engine soon as the current one has been kept
alive by a dr.frankenstein of a P.O, I can only imagine what it'll sound like
then.

One word though, the work is messy, and the materials quite pricey, but
goddam!

if you missed it first time around:
