Royal PITA???  Huh?  Compared to a T1 complete reseal it couldn't be easier.
Squeeze it and go *before* you clutter up the engine compartment with
wiring, air filter, hoses etc. Put the fat foamy side up, seam center  &gt;
front of the vehicle.

&gt; gaskets on BEFORE i install the engine?  i also bought a new foam engine
&gt; seal (thanks mice!)  at what stage should i put this on, before or after
&gt; the engine is in the compartment?

I always put the foam in dead last, after the engine has been started,
initial tune up everything... the foam is a royal PITA to get in and gets
in the way while doing some of the other installation jobs and I always
seem to manage to tear it taking it out so this lowers the risk of damage
to it.

&gt; also, what tools/cleaners has anyone used to clean the engine?  the shop

people clean engines??????   ;8*?

Have a good trip
