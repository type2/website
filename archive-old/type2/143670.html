&gt; How are the brakes doing ?? Any chance with the caliper ?

I've verified that the right front brake hose is partially blocked (as
everyone suspected!), but haven't had the opportunity to take anything apart
yet -- mainly on account of not having my own garage.  I'm about to leave for
L.A. tomorrow morning (by train, mind you!) and plan on working on the brakes
in someone else's garage sometime when I'm back, after Memorial Day.  Will
give the list a full report then.
