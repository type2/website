Subject: A Note On SoundProofing Products...

Hello Everyone,

Lately the occasional message pops up about soundproofing.  I too am one who
wishes a quieter ride in my Westy
so I have done some homework.
First off, I find that Dynamat and Q-Pads are way too expensive, we just
have too much area to cover.
So the search began...I found a company that sells a similiar product call
B-Quiet
http://b-quiet.server101_dot_com/original.html

This is pulled from the Website
&gt;Shhhh! Are you tired of paying $5 to $6 per square foot for brand name
deadeners like Dynamat®??
&gt;B-Quiet Original is a 1.5mm thick, embossed polyethylene and rubberized SBS
asphalt material. It is very flexible and is
 self-adhesive with a removable paper backing.

Their product is approx $2.77US/sqft to $1.07US/sqft in quantity. Wow, you
say._dot_compared to $5 to $6/sqft of dynamat.

Well it gets better...
The other day I was in The Home Depot here in Canada and I came across a
huge roll of this roofing membrane called Progard
I wrote down the name of the company (Emcoltd Building Products)and ripped
off a small peice that was dangling off the corner.

_info_roof_overview.htm

This is pulled from the Website
&gt;PROGARD is a tough, flexible roofing membrane made of two of the most
effective waterproofing materials known -
strong, non-slip embossed polyethylene and rubberized SBS asphalt. The
result is a &gt;tough water barrier which adheres
fully to the roof deck. PROGARD is supplied in rolls 36&quot; wide and 65' long
and has a total thickness of 60 mils or 1.5mm.
It is self-adhesive and can be applied in &gt;temperatures as low as 4º C (40º
F).
Sound familiar?

The roll at was $69.00CAN, about $45US for 195sqft! ... $0.23/sqft.
Now we're talkin'...

BTW I took that piece of material home and ran some bench test on it with a
heat gun.  The stuff begins to deteriorate/melt at temps much
higher than what sunlight would produce in our vans.

Ciao
