The trick to that is to snip a two or three square section out of the
screen, so that you can get your socket and extension in ther. (you may
redirect all flames to dev-null_at_type2_dot_com, thank you.)

Unsafe?  As long as the vehicle is properly chocked, i guess not.  My
problem would be in trying to move the bus, AND watch the wee little
notches, AND stop the thing from moving in time...and going back the other
way when one goes to far.  Oh, and a lack of inclines in the area...;)

if it works for you, great.

&gt; 4-step? I got the impression that the engineers thought the cam location for 
&gt; the &quot;extra&quot; valves to be adjusted via that procedure  might not be in the 
&gt; same position as if the cylinder were at true TDC.

With a stock cam, you should be pretty much OK.  There is a large off-ramp
zone on the cam.  With some differnt profile aftermarket cams, one might
run into a problem, though i am not sure.


later...david
