By the way, I might as well throw 2 cents in here.

I've had RMMW ship me the wrong part, but that doesn't mean they're bad
people.

I've never had a problem with The Bus Depot, but that doesn't mean
boo-boos never occur.

I have a GEX engine that has performed without problems, and since
break-in, I've used nothing but Castrol Syntec synthetic in it (sans
gasoline in the case!) and it does not leak oil or run hot.
