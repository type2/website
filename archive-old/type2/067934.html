&gt;On a type-IV 2.0L engine w/ hydraulic lifters, what's it mean when a
&gt;valve never stops clicking?  Drive it 200 miles, and you still hear it
&gt;ticking away back there.  Compression is fine both cylinders that head
&gt;(135 and 145 last check).  Engine history unknown [probably original
&gt;engine for this bus, with either 80K or 180K, and may or may not have
&gt;been rebuilt sometime in the past (but not in the last 40K miles,
&gt;according to PO)].

Either the lifter is bad or it needs bled/adjusted.  In either case it's
no big deal as it can be done without removing the engine or head.  Bentley
and Haynes should both have procedures for setting the initial valve lash.
I believe it's to set the screw two turns in once it's made contact with the
valve (in the closed position, of course).  If that doesn't fix it, I'd
remove the lifter, take it apart and clean it.  If it's STILL not fixed,
then you probably need a new one (about $10 EACH).
