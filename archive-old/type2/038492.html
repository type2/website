Hi,

Of the 80 buses that made is to SoggyBus(EveryBus) there were a few
heartaches. What became of Dave Ireland? Did he make it back to Canada? I
have not seen anything from the rest of the Canadian Contingent and am
starting to worry. Dave I hope you made it home safely!!!!!!!!!!!!

Instead of clogging up you mailboxes with a trip report I will be posting
one the Website in the coming days.
