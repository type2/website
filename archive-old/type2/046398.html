The cheap import engine stands are ok for the small T-1 motor. They don't
come with the adapter you need for the VW motor. JC Whipme sells the
adaptor as do most Californicated VW shops. You would be time/money ahead
to pay the $70 'cause you couldn't save but a few coins tryin' to do better
with mixed sources. 

For T-4 motors, the &quot;heavy duty&quot; import stands should be used. Or you could
use any quality stand. They weigh quite a bit more than the T-1. Same
adaptor works. 

In either case, you will also need a spacer for the lower mounting stud. A
metal tube/pipe of appropriate diameter and lenght is needed to clear the
ring gear and flywheel.
