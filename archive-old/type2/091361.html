Subject: Re: Need Westfalia Camper manual

__SNIP -  I though the supplemental
camper manual was in the car but it turns out it was just a second copy
of
the Vanagon manual.--------

Tom,

	Someone made me a very nice copy of the camper manual.  I can copy mine
for you and probably bind it to.  I'll trade for a copy of the Vanagon
owner's manual.
