Subject: Re: [T2] brake problem with a twist (help)?

&gt; If I repeatedly pump my brakes while my 77 is at a stand still, I can
stall
&gt; the bus out.


The 1st question that comes to mind is: WHY are you repeatedly pumping your
brakes at a standstill???

Kinda sounds like you are creating a problem......
