Subject: Re: [T2] Electronic ignition opposed to points &amp; condenser

&gt; The dude at the parts shop I go to tried to sell me an electronic ignition
&gt; replacement module instead of putting in new points and condenser. He says
&gt; he runs one in his bus, and rarely has trouble with it. Does anybody have
&gt; any info or experience with these devices?

For the 72 and up type4 engines, I like to use the 79-83 Calif Vanagon
electronic ignition. It is an almost drop-in swap that uses all VW parts.
