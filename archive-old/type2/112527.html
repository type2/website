Subject: swing lever bushings

Doing a complete axl rebuild on my 76 and wanted to know of a good source for 
the swing lever bushings. My steering was sloppy before teardown and all other 
components looked good. I know I just talked to the VW dealer and the part (211 
405 317B) is NLA. Saw in the archives where people were talking of replacing 
them with a kit of some sort. Any clues as my 69 needs some too.
