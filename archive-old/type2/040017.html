On the wrench part: they make metal (aluminum?) oil filter sockets. These fit on the back of the oil filter and you use a regular ½&quot; ratchet to unscrew them. Just check your FLAP (around here everyone including Trak Auto and PepBoys has them). Make sure you get the right size.

When you replace the oil filter, fill it before you screw it in. That way your oil pressure won't drop for the time the filter needs to fill up when you start the engine.
