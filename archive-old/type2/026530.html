&gt;I need one side (4) early 1700 pushrod tubes p# 021 109 335 A w/ 23,5mm 
&gt;outer o-ring diameter rather than the commonly available superceded 
&gt;021 109 335 C  w/ 25mm outer o-ring land diameter.

???  That's the first I've ever heard about that.  I can't find any mention
of it in my books either.  Were the holes in the heads where the tubes go
smaller?  Just curious for more info on this.
