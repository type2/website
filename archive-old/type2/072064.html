Subject: Clutch cable

Hi all,

Spent a deep and meaningful afternoon today underneath Sally, changing the
clutch cable.  Not easy when you've got a bad back (cue violins).  It all
started a couple of weeks ago when I was taking my daughter to a concert.
Pushed the clutch in, there was a faint 'ping' and the pedal felt looser
than before.  The following day I had a job interview and just as I started
off, there was another 'ping', now it was getting hard to change gear.  I
drove the 60 miles to the interview thinking &quot;why me?&quot;, &quot;today of all days&quot;
etc, tightened the clutch in the car park of the hotel where the interview
was (in my best clothes of course).  It was right at the end of the
adjustment and I knew I was on borrowed time.  Anyway the interview went
fairly well and I got back OK.

The cable had broken inside the flexible conduit.  I presume this is a
common place for it to go, it's a straight run otherwise.  It was down to
the last 4 strands.

The second interview is on Friday about 150 miles away.  At leaset I will
feel more confident of getting there this time.
