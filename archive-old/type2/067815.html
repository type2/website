Just looked at this.  Am I seeing a rear small truck aftermarket 
pass through sliding window installed into the FRONT of a loaf?

If this is the case, hold your horses.  Front windshields are made 
differently than rear.  Additional plastic layers in there, and 
differences in the glass itself to prevent shards of glass from 
impaling themselves in your face when breaking.

Even with proper GLASS in there, I have my doubts that this style of 
window would keep out the rain whilst driving.

thinkin' it WOULD be cool to have Safari style in a Vanagon.


&gt; While going through some photos yesterday I came across an 
&gt; example of a rare breadloaf option...
&gt; 
&gt; M-BR549  Safari windshield
&gt; 
&gt; I called a friend of mine who is a K-Mart manager and into later 
&gt; buses, and he said that he has several of these in his parts 
&gt; stash and would be willing to sell them (along with installation 
&gt; kit) for $75 each.
