Subject: Pop top canvas

After 3 months of waiting,  I finally have at the bus farm a very nice gold
colored '76 westy with 37K original miles on it!  This is one nice bus
except for a few &quot;dings&quot; that the elderly couple who bought it new put on
it.  The sliding door moves like a new one, the paint looks new, tranny
shifts as smooth as silk with no play and the body is solid, that's
pronounced &quot;no rust&quot;.  I have never had a bus so nice, my 19 month old
daughter and I are going to enjoy camping next summer.

My question is has to do with the very nice original top which is in great
shape, no tears.  But when I tried to put the top up this past weekend, it
was very tight from shrinking over the years and I didn't want to tear it.
Any way to put a little &quot;stretch&quot; in the old fabric?  It would be nice to
save the top.  Is there some sort of &quot;saddle soap&quot; or some other fabric
cream that can be put on the canvas to soften it up?  Thanks.
