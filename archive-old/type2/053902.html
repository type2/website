custom parts: yes, the desire is there (and so is the ability), but MOST VW
owners are flat out cheapskates, so it's pointless to built a product that
is going to make 5% of the potential customers happy, and 95% furious and
start bitching that they are being &quot;gouged and taken advantage of&quot;.

It ain't worth the hassle.

Now with that being said, I sure hope I don't field a barrage of hate-mail
&gt;from the &quot;5%&quot; saying that I have bus owners &quot;all wrong&quot;. Most of you guys
are in the 5%, it's the other ones that are a problem.
