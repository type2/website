Subject: Re: [T2] felt washer?

If the AVP engine came with the flywheel mounted then I'm sure they put one
in.  If you used your own flywheel then you *still* might have one since
they're easy to overlook; it may have been there in the flywheel all along,
you just didn't notice.

I believe the felt washer or seal is there to help keep grease from
migrating from the pilot bearing out to the clutch.  I'm not sure how &quot;bad&quot;
it is not to have one, but I sure wouldn't drop the engine just because of
that.

&gt; Um, yup. That's what the Bay Bentley shows too. I'm not sure where I got
&gt; that idea.  In fact, I'm not sure if my avp rebuild came with a felt ring;
I
&gt; sure didn't put one in.  What does it do exactly, and how bad is it to not
&gt; have one?

&gt;
&gt; They've been included in any gasket kit I've have for an air-cooled
Vanagon
&gt; engine.  Since the late bays ran similar TypeIV engines they're bound to
&gt; have them.  Illustration 13.7 of the Vanagon Bentley shows the &quot;felt
ring.&quot;
