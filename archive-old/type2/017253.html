&gt;I have not pulled a drum on this
&gt;bus, and need some help from the list.

&gt;How do I pull it?

&gt;I am under the belief that I will need
&gt;to crank off the Axle Nut. ('78 bus)

&gt;Is that true?

No.

On a '78 bus, the rear axle nut is 46mm, not 36mm, but it doesn't matter
because you don't need to loosen or remove that nut to pull the brake
drum.  You'd only need to remove that nut if the stub axle was to be
removed for bearing/seal replacement.

Removing the drums on these buses is easier than on most.  While it's
prudent to back off the adjusters in order to retract the shoes a bit,
it's often not necessary.  On looking at the face of the brake drum,
you'll see two small bolts (10mm heads).  These hold the drum to the
hub.  Remove these two bolts and the brake drum should come off with
little or no fuss.
