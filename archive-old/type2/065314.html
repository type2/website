Subject: RE: &quot;Hammering&quot; sound in 81

Sounds like a loose exhaust or heat exchanger connection. On my engine=20
the J-tubes aren't bolted on one side and they bang on occasion under=20
heavy load, like going  up hill.=20

Mine does this all the time. I am leaving it alone to remind me that I=20
want a new engine, so every time I hear it, I take all the money out of 

my wallet and put it in a mayonnaise jar in the backyard.

&gt; Acouple of weeks ago while I was returning from the store with my son 

&gt; when we
&gt; suddenly heard a loud hammering sound that lasted for about 2 seconds 

&gt; and
&gt; then quit. At the time I was doing about 25 up hill and in a hard 
right
&gt; curve. It was definitely a mechanical sound of the sinking heart=20
&gt; variety but
&gt; I wasn't even sure that it was us since there was no effect on the=20
&gt; vehicle.
&gt; The thumping was less than 10 per second, in other words less than 
what=20
&gt; I
&gt; would expect of a reving engine. With no repetition, I forgot about 
it=20
&gt; or at
&gt; least wished it away.
&gt;=20
&gt; Now this weekend I take a 150 mile jaunt to the mountains and 
virtually=20
&gt; the
&gt; same thing happens and under about the same circumstances; up hill 
and=20
&gt; in a
&gt; right turn doing about 25 for about a second and then pause and then=20
&gt; another
&gt; second. Didn't experience it again for the balance of the trip or the 

&gt; return.
&gt; What was different this time was that I had the windows up so it 
wasn't
&gt; nearly as loud and I had the impression that it was coming from the=20
&gt; front end
&gt; of the van rather than the engine. Again no effect felt, just noise.=20
&gt;=20
&gt; Any ideas? Responses a long the line of &quot;Oh yeah, that's normal&quot; 
would=20
&gt; be
&gt; preferred.
&gt;=20
&gt; Thanks,
