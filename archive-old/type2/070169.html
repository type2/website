Subject: Eddie Hintz needs places to crash

Got a message today from Eddie. He's on the way back to Austin from Inuvik.
The server keps bouncing the message out for some reason (sometimes it does
this) so I'm forwarding. Reply to Eddiehintz_at_aol_dot_com.

&gt;Hey now,
&gt;     We've spent too much cash on this trip, and we're hurting now. We're
&gt;headed home for Austin, and could use some places along the way to crash. The
&gt;route is planned for the following: from Spokane, we head out 90 to
&gt;Yellowstone, then down through Colorado to Clovis NM, so if anyone lives in
&gt;the general area of any of this route, and would like a visit, we'd love to
&gt;stop... Just drop me a line at this address, I'll get the mail tomorrow (13
&gt;August) in Spokane. I'll likely find a place to log in later too, so just
&gt;drop a line. Thanks!!
&gt;Peace,
&gt;Eddie
