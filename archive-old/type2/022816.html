Subject: mystery to me...
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL - A

Gentlepersons-
                       Picking over a said-to-be-74 Bus, I pulled the wiring 
(intact, just
plugs, no cuts) and the large plug and silver box from the upper right side 
of 
the engine bay. Part # on the silver box is VW 022  906  021  S, Plug # is
022 906 239. I tried my Unisyn on it but got nuthin' :-(  I'll pass this on 
but
is there any way to test it? Carbs are on all my cars, so FI is Greek (Geek?)
to me...
