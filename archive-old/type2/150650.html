&amp;gt; It would seem obvious that aluminium is a better choice, since it
&amp;gt; lasts longer and VW actually used it starting with the type 4. I've
&amp;gt; found two people (John Conolly and this list member who complains
&amp;gt; about his &amp;quot;crapcase&amp;quot; who dislike the aluminium case)  but I did not
&amp;gt; quite get why they are no good for type 1.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; So anyone has aluminium case and likes it ?

It's not the material that is the problem.  It's the fact that the
machining on the aluminum cases is not accurate.  VW does not make the
aluminum type 1 cases.  They are made by the aftermarket.  If they could
machine them right they would be winners.

If you want a well-machined aluminum type 1 case, all you have to do is
get a wasserboxer case and cut the water jacket off!  You get a spin-on
oil filter too!  This is no easy project, but probably easier than making
the current aluminum cases right.
