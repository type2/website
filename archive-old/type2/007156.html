Nathan,

I have &quot;heard&quot; that its water and other combustion by products that build up 
in the oil and PCV systems of around town daily drivers.  These vehicles get 
started up and shut off alot without ever hitting the open road for extended 
periods of time. (?)

Multi-weight oils are fine, adjust what you use to the climate you drive in.
