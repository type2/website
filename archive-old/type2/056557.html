Today when trying to start my '69 Campermobile,  It cranked, stayed on
for about 30 seconds, then made a faint, but definate, pop.  It cut off
and I have not been able to start it again.  Upon opening the engine
door and inspection, I found a small rubber elbow on the right side of
the engine (the passenger side).  It is about one and a half to two
inches tall.  It looks to be closed in the middle.  One end is larger in
diameter than the other.

I belive this to be the pop.  I'm not sure because i have only had this
bus for two or three weeks.  And have yet to have the time to learn all
it's parts.  I have only now studied the engine compartment well.  I
have the two manuals (bently and idiot guide) and neither is any help.

I was hopeing you would be better help.

My VW is broke.  I wish to fix it.  My self.

Thanks for your help.
