Subject: Gauge placement questions

Hi list. I have a question about mounting gauges in my  ' 79 westy. I was 
thinking about putting them in the dash, under the radio, and using the three 
gauge mounting fixture that I bought from Bus Boys. But when I look at it 
now, I start to wonder if this placement won't be a bit difficult to see, and 
if it wouldn't be better to put them in a pod on top of the dash where they 
fall directly in my line of sight while driving. Could any of you with the 
dash mounted gauges please give me your input as to how you like the set-up?
TIA
Parker
