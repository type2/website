Subject: Re: Camping List and panty hose

I am a humbler, more educated, and now much wiser-in-the-ways-or-the-world 
guy, and will start carrying pantyhose with me as I travel. I have an 
upcoming trip to Chicago and back in June [from St. Pete Fl.] and will take 
some with me.  but if I gotta explain them to a State Trooper or County 
Sheriff, I'M BLAMING YOU GUYS!!
