Subject: oil cooler adapter *dog house  type oil cooler*
Date: Tue, 26 Dec 2000 13:42:35 -0800
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I am putting together a stock 1600 *turnkey* dual port engine, to be used
temporarily in my 71 bus, while my current engine is in the machine shop.. I
am in need of the adapter that attaches the oil cooler to the top of the
engine case. The supplier I usually get them from *SCAT* is on vacation
until sometime in January.  Does anyone have this adapter, good used, or
new, that they could send me?
