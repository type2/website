Subject: did i hear someone say transporter?
Message-Id: &lt;4.1.19990701082146.00966120_at_deepwell_dot_com&gt;

i thought i heard someone mention the word &quot;Transporter&quot; referring to a
magazine or somesuch.
i dropped by the bookstore shortly before picking up my girl from work, and
did not see one on the rack; the new HotVWs, sure - although they *didn't*
have a VWTrends which is why i'm asking.
i just lost my job networking a transportation company [lost due to owners
blatant ignorance of computers - wouldn't even consider upgrading after i
had him purchase a 56k modem to replace the 14.4 he was using - i was
suggesting isdn the whole time, but i got everything up with wingate..
anyway - that's besides the point]

what i'm getting at, is - i'll figure out a way to publish Transporter if
it isn't already in print.
