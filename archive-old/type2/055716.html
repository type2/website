Subject: RE: Loaf camper layouts

Mark and All;

The PO of our 1970 poptop Campmobile had an RV shop build some custom 
modifications to the interior prior to an extended trip to Alaska.  The 
modifications included replacing the rear-facing passenger seat behind the 
driver with an elaborate installation that incorporated a 2-burner propane 
cooktop, outside vented propane tank storage, and some counter space.

I didn't like this setup at all, because it took up a great deal of space that 
we'd never use.  Cooking inside the bus makes me very nervous, and the PO's 
cooking there had already resulted in heat damage to the ceiling paneling 
above the cooktop. 

I removed all this stuff and replaced it with a reproduction rear-facing seat 
customized to accommodate a portable toilet.  This addition has worked out 
extremely well, and is something that adds tremendously to the livability of 
the camper.  Since the unit I built occupies the same &quot;footprint&quot; as the 
Westfalia-installed rear-facing seat there's no reduction in the interior 
floor space.

The sink/cooler unit in the early loaf Campmobiles is easily removed when not 
needed, freeing up a lot of floorspace/interior volume for the occasional trip 
to the lumber yard or &quot;sanitary landfill&quot;.  The rear-facing seat also removes 
easily if maximum space is needed.  With both out the entire volume of the van 
is clear from the bulkheads behind the front seats to the front of the rear 
seat/bed, except for the forward few inches of the closet assembly.  The side 
door opening is completely unobstructed in this configuration.

We always take the Westy on long family road trips, because having onboard 
facilities for napping (fold-down bed), sanitation (onboard toilet), and 
washing/food storage  allows us to stop only for fuel or leg stretching 
breaks.

The overall simplicity of this Campmobile layout is also appealing to us.  
This interior embodies the &quot;KISS principal&quot; nicely.  The basics are there, and 
they're robust, efficient, and trouble-free.  On long vacations a bag of ice 
each day takes care of food preservation, the Westy water tank has ample but 
not excessive capacity (water is heavy stuff!), and there's enough storage 
space that a 2-week camping trip in summer only needs one quick laundromat 
break.

This all makes me prefer this version of the Campmobile interior 
layout/installation.  I don't believe the later layouts are as versatile or as 
easily removed and re-installed when the van is needed for alternative uses.

&gt;&gt; it would be interesting to read pros and cons of the in-line driver's side 
Westy kit of later loaves versus the earlier, split-like kits. &lt;&lt;
