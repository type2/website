Tagging on to David's message...

Anyone know how the wires really go in for the blower?  Bentley is not as
clear as I seem to need.

Thanks, again!

&gt; Dear Volks,
&gt;
&gt; I got a clean bill of health Monday from my mechanic on my new to me 1975
&gt; Westy.  Only one thing is wrong.  The heater blower assembly that sits
above
&gt; the motor in the engine compartment is completely missing.  I don't need
it
&gt; yet in Texas, but it could be defroster weather in another month or so.
&gt;
&gt; If anyone has one from a 1975 bus they are parting out or might know a
&gt; source, please pmail me.  I'm new to Type 4's so I don't know if other
years
&gt; had the same blower.  Can someone tell me if there are other years that
will
&gt; also work.  This is not a catalog type item, and I haven't had any luck
with
&gt; the local salvage yards.  Also has anyone rigged up some kind of alternate
&gt; solution?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance, David Hunt
&gt;
