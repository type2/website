Subject: Flooded engine. Really.

So I'm under the bus behind the left rear wheel and I feel a drip on my 
forehead.  It was coming from a little rubber plug up under the battery 
tray. I popped out the plug and sploosh! About a pint, maybe a quart of 
water poured out of the engine compartment.

My question--is it common for rain to enter the rear air intakes (1974)? 
Seems like it would cause a few problems, having one's battery floating 
around in a pool of water. Maybe I should leave the drain hole unplugged?
