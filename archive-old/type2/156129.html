Subject: Silversocket

Well, I spent a couple of hours trying to make a SilverSocket  adaptor.  I may be telling you something you already know but  Radio Shack is absolutely worthless anymore.  When I was active in  ham radio, I used to be able to get a lot of small connectors and parts  there.  Now they don't have crap.  Didn't even have a female  cigarette lighter plug.  Had expensive adaptors but no basic  plug.  Found that at Advance.  
  
  I went to my local John Deere dealer and got the male socket.   Richard, you may need to update your site.  That part number  RE11344 is right but the price was $17.93, almost twenty bucks with  tax.  But I do like how tight it fits.  I got an inline fuse  and all to make a good adaptor.  I think when I get and adapt my  camper stool, I'm going to put a panel of them in there to power the  stereo and accessories.    Cheers...KR
