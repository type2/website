Subject: Wood Species and Properties Website

Hey, All.
That discussion about wood in the poptop reminded me of a site:
http://www.woodfinder_dot_com/index.php
and hit the WOOD PROPERTIES link.

Teak is extremely decay and insect resistant, but overkill. White oak also
wicks water up like a straw, red doesn't. Cedar, if it's strong enough would
be perfect, I think. I don't know what the parts look like or how sturdy
they have to be. Lots of wood boats have cedar planking.
