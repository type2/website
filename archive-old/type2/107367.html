Subject: Re: Gas heater help

Do you have any of the bn4 tune up articles from ron van ness?
He's apparently taken them off the type2 web site but some folks may
still have a copy saved.(I'd be really interested in obtaining them btw)
I sourced a fabric called Buna-N from an outfit in spokane, they sent me
a sheet about 1ft square for $8 or some trivial amount.
The info I have on the company is: Nott/Atwater 1-800-288-7278 I spoke
with Sue but that was over a year ago. 
You'll need to make a choice on thickness and make sure you tell them
you want the stuff that is gas resistant and what application you're
using it for.

I've made my own diaphragms for years on BN4s, should be the same
technique on the bn2.

Make sure you don't have a fuel return line on your bn2 or if you do
that you address the problem.

Good luck,
