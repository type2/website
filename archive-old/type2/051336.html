Had these type 2's been converted to US specifications or did the state let 
these threw the system?  I have seen instances where the Customs Dept. has 
issued hot numbers on vehicles exported for vacation and short residency.  
Meaning these vehicles had to show proof of disposition or re-exportation 
back to the country of departure.  Then these vehicles VIN numbers are 
automatically displayed with a notation when they are stopped for traffic 
offenses, registration or accident claims and reports.  I have seen some 
vehicles that sit for a prolonged period of time 5 years or so then drop off 
the charts completely thus enabling a lost title or rebuilt title be issued.  
Once instance where a coworker got burned was with a VW golf wagen.  the 
owner said the vehicle had been either destroyed or stolen, and that cleared 
him threw customs, but when my partner went to register the vehicle and 
showing a bill of sale for over 7000 smackers he had to go to court clear his 
name and then march immediately down to the police dept. and have them escort 
him and the car down to the local wrecking yard to destroy the car.  Just be 
careful everyone!!!!!
