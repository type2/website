Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Homemade air conditioner in a VW? G.Lyle?

George Lyle, take note-

Re the suggestion of a self-draining ice chest- I always thought it was 
more efficient (longest cooling period) to let a cooler &quot;stew in its own 
32 deg F juices&quot; until all the ice had melted, as opposed to letting it 
drain the constant melted water away- is that not true?  My common sense 
thinking is by draining it, you are throwing away 32 deg water, much 
cooler than the surrounding air of a summer day!  Yes, ice may be  below 
32 deg when made in a freezer, so the air inside the cooler may be 
initially colder, but it won't last as long in is job of keeping drinks
40-50deg cooler on a hot day?  Me, I avoid the mess by freezing water in 
old OJ cartons and putting them in my cooler- gives you drinkable cold 
water to boot.
