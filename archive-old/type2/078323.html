Subject: Re: [T2] Z Products Z-Bed Conversion Kit

I think I saw a kit similar to this at the bus boys
website. http://www.busboys_dot_com I had one of these in
my 71 deluxe. It worked good except the legs on the
seats cracked. I went through two rear seats because
of this problem.
Thanks,
Tyler

&gt; In researching stuff for my '67 Microbus, I came
&gt; across Z Products' Z-Bed
&gt; conversion kit (www.zproducts_dot_com). I was very
&gt; interested in it, until later
&gt; reading in the archive that they had stopped
&gt; producing the kit. This kit is
&gt; the only one I know of that lets you use the
&gt; original back seat in a VW bus
&gt; and convert it to a bed when desired, rather than
&gt; installing a
&gt; Westfalia-type camper Z-bed or a homemade
&gt; convertible back &quot;sofa.&quot; I like
&gt; the idea of retaining the original look of my
&gt; non-camper, but easily being
&gt; able to camp, too.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, I was interested enough to call them today
&gt; and plead, and I found
&gt; out they do make them, but only when they have
&gt; enough interest to run a
&gt; batch. They told me that interest has dropped to the
&gt; point where no batch
&gt; has been run in a while. I replied that since many
&gt; people believe they no
&gt; longer make the kit, that may be why no one is
&gt; calling or emailing to order.
&gt; 
&gt; For them, a batch is about thirty units (for any bus
&gt; up to '79), not the
&gt; half-dozen or so they presently have customer names
&gt; for. I asked them to add
&gt; my name to the list, and I wanted everyone on
&gt; Vintagebus and Type2 to know
&gt; that the product can be available if enough of us
&gt; ask for it. I think it's
&gt; an elegant solution for a non-camper conversion bus,
&gt; and I have to believe
&gt; there's enough interest out there to generate
&gt; sufficient orders, once people
&gt; realize that it is available and know exactly what
&gt; it is.
&gt; 
&gt; Let them know if you're interested.
