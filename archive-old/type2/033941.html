Subject: childs cot poles

I have a '77 Westy with a child's cot.  The &quot;poles&quot; are square and one half 
slides inside the other thereby adjusting the length.

I was very happy when I figured out what the hell the cot was. I feel silly 
now, but when I bought my Westy there was this piece of canvas with square 
poles in it and I had now clue what it was.  Nice of the PO to leave it for 
me.  I figured it out only because someone stopped me in the parking lot to 
reminesce about growing up camping in a Westy exactly like mine.  The woman 
asked if I had the cot that went over the front seats and a little light 
went on- So that's what that is.  Duh.  Anyway later I was cleaning out a 
bunch of maps and crap in another bus I bought and found a mint condition 
Westy Manual with pics and explanations of everything.

I have it scanned and plan on posting it on my web page some day... but I'd 
send it to any list member who wants it.

Hope that help the child cot quandary.
