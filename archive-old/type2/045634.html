Subject: [T2] Teenager's national tour...WOAH

Volks,

Thanks all for your concern...but some critical info has been dropped in the 
discussion. This guy has been driving since age 8 on the deer lease, and over 
a year on the roads. He has competed nationally in model airplane comps, 
including CL jet speed, where he built his own models and reworked his 
engines. He has been helping me with mechanics for a couple of years, runs 
lathes, welds, blacksmiths, and is an accomplished jazz bassist. Not bad for 
a 16 year old.

The trip is next summer. By that time, the van will have 9 months on it, and 
it is hoped that it will be thoroughly wrung out.

None of this guarantees safety, but there are no guarantees in life. In a 
hard chance, I'd rather have Bryce by my side than most 22 year olds that I 
know the fact that he is 6'5&quot; and 190 lbs is a bonus :-).

Sure, there is a risk in letting him go, but there is a risk in keeping him 
close, also.

With the help we've been getting from the list, I think he will be as safe in 
China Cat as he would be in a new Saturn :-)

Thanks again for the concern and the good info on outfitting the bus.

Cheers/Carron
