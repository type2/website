Subject: Re: [T2] AIRS UPDATES: (Was Re: [T2] Hi all - long)

&gt; When I first started to look into this, I hadn't looked at the AIRS
&gt; list. I foolishly thought that I could easily download the entire list
&gt; and validate the whole thing en masse. Clearly, that's not possible. I
&gt; did 2 states to see if the output was valuable. Now that I've done it,
&gt; though, I don't know what to do with my results. Any ideas?

Did you actually talk to the people, or just verify that their phone
numbers were valid? I ask becouse they only wait like six months or so
I think before they give out a disconnected number again. So just
becouse a number is valid, and hooked up, doesn't mean the person who
has it is the same person who signed up for AIRS.

But since we're talking about all this work anyway, is anyone good at
database work? Wouldn't it be GREAT if you could search the AIRS list
by like, ZIP, or AREA CODE, or EMERGENCY ONLY tags? I'd be willing to
do the Data Entry for it for Washington, maybe other states too, but I
don't wanna commit to something THAT large. :) Or if your REALLY good,
use a tie-in with mapquest or something, so that you can put in where
you break down at, and it will bring up 10 people, in your area, that
have marked their available for that hour of day.   But alas, I'm
getting WAY ahead of myself. :)

Better go before I start suggesting GPS and Hand Held Ham Radio
Transmitters. :)
