Subject: erratic high beams

Recently, when I am driving at night in my '71 Westy,   the high beams
click on every minute or so.

 Sometimes I can turn them off using the turn signal handle; other times
this doesn't work.

I stumbled on a procedure that does always turns them off, though. There is
a cable bundle which comes from underneath the dashboard and disappears
into the steering column. Whenever the high beams click on, if I push or
pull on this bundly, the high beams click off.

What triggers the high beams? Is it the application of 12V to a relay?
I've looked at the circuit diagram but have no ideas on why these high
beams suddenly come on or what the role of the cable bundle is in this
malfunction.

Can someone suggest a connection between the cable and my problem?

thanks, Jack
