Subject: Re: [T2] vanagon line drawings

Had a guy that was interesting in buying the engine out of my parts van, 
but wants to use it for a t4 conversion into a bug...aand I don't think
it's going to work because it doesn't have the right oil breather
tower on it.

Regardless of which conversion he uses he can just cut the breather off. The BAS Ahnendorp kit required me to shorten the non-Vanagon version even... 

I'm running a '78 Type IV engine in a '65 Beetle sitting on a '69 IRS pan. E-mail if you or your buyer has any questions. 

Chris
