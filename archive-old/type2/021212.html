I think it's because your word is taken as gospel on this list Sean.  No
questions asked.  I for one appreciate all you have to give to the list.
(any more screw-ups like that and I may have to change my opinion...  LOL)

Thanks

&gt; What disappoints me most is that NO ONE called me on this, which means
&gt; either no one reads my posts or no one knows any better.  Knowing the

&gt;
&gt; Sorry for any confusion
