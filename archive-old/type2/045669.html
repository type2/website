Subject: [T2] RE: Sorry,Tyres again.

Hi,
&gt; I followed the tyre thread but have a question now after 
&gt; deviating from the
&gt; norm.
&gt; Michelin Classic, 185 R14 C, looking OK.
&gt; But 8 ply (1875 lbs) vs. 6 ply (1540 lbs) so appeared well specified.
&gt; But the legend on the tyres say1875 lbs _at_ 65 psi cold.
&gt; This is well away from the VW text of 30lbs front, 37lbs rear.
&gt; Do I use 65 psi and have a hard ride or guess at 50 psi and 
&gt; run these tyres
&gt; underinflated ?


 NO!!!!

 The number on the tyre is the MAXIMUM pressure the tyre can take, and
the load is tha MAXIMUM that it can handle (at this pressure, since
a high pressure is needed for a heavy load).

 You should use the VW specifications in your owners manual (or
something pretty close). From memory that's 30psi in front and
42 psi in rear for a full load (3/4 tonne). If unladen they
recommend dropping the REAR pressure by about 4.5psi, which
gets you ~37. hence the text you quote is spot on.

 The sidewalls tell you what the tyre is capable of- the owners
manual tells you how it should be used.
