&gt; I sure felt that way when the kid in the Honda Accord tried to change lanes
&gt; into the side of my VW.  There was a fairly loud sound, but the Bus didn't
&gt; shake even a little.
&gt;
&gt; Passenger: &quot;What was that sound?&quot;
&gt; Me: &quot;I think a car just hit us.&quot;
&gt; Passenger: &quot;Seriously?&quot;

&gt; Sometimes small really is better...I needed to sign a paper in NYC
once and drove my Bugeye in...I needed a parking space for just
five minutes, so I used the trailer/office at the construction site
across the street...Slipped right under... ;-)
