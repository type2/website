Hi,

 From a VW pancake? I don't see how. Upgrading the ignition system
addresses the most common failures... once that's done a type-4
engine is about as reliable as you can get. No water pump to fail,
no hoses to crack, no radiator to burst or leak. Keep the engine
bay seals tight, the valves adjusted and just drive, drive, drive...

Cheers,
