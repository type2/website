Steven,

&gt; I have a little &quot;hatch&quot; in the floor that I believe is part of my
&gt; heating system(wich is missing a few this and thats) I plan on just covering
&gt; it up and forget I ever saw it, what was this used for? 

Is this hatch approx. 20cm x 20cm and located somewhat close to the sliding door? If so, your bus had an underfloor LPG heater at some point. See if you can find the gas line, mine is routed underneath the bench, through the floor, across the outrigger, into the box underneath the hatch.
If you have any remains of the heater left in there and do not intend to use it, I would gladly dispose of them properly (into my camper ...).
Sorry, I don't have any more info on this. The only thing that is left of my heater is the hatch, box, and gas line.
I believe, it was an option on '73 and '74 Westys. Mine is an '74 with the orange interior.

Cheers,
Marcus
