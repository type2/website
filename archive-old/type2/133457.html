&gt; I was informed today, the day before I fly to new mexico to pick up my new
&gt; bus, that they keep the plates in that state and that id be driving back
&gt; without them.
&gt;
&gt; he offered to take me to the local DMV to get a $5 tag to cover me in New
&gt; Mexico, but what good is that going to do me on the rest of my trip back to
&gt; MN?
&gt;
&gt; suggestions? anyone deal with this before?

some states and insurance companies allow you &quot;X&quot; number of days to make a
formal transfer of tags to a new vehicle.  can you take your current tags
with you, put them on the vehicle and drive it home...with your current
registration and a bill of sale dated within that time space you should be
ok....what you do when it is in your driveway is up to you.

my state allows 10 days I believe
