Subject: loose sterring / front end?

Hi!  I have a 78 Westy. 

It wanders .....  So my question is where to start the rebuild / replace 
of what parts in the front end?  I have no idea how many miles are on 
the bus.  

It doesn't shimmy or shake, but the bus wanders around the lane.  Wind 
aggravates the issue and that is some what normal but moving out of your 
lane?

What steps would I need to take to diagnosis the issues?  
Recommendations please?

TIA
