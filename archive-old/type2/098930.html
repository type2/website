I removed mine because it was far too old and rusty and it was the first part I bought 6 months ago not realizing the 04016 rotor was still available.

I still have the newish 04033 rotor on my bus and I've been wondering what exactly happens when the rotor &quot;cuts out&quot;? Does it cause a backfire?

I'm sure there are pros and cons to having it installed but frankly my bus, which is in fine shape, loses HP well before 5400rpm and I see little need for this item unless you are lending your bus out and you need to think twice about giving your bus to someone you think will benefit from having that rotor installed.

Years ago when I last drove my bus reguarly I never pushed the bus to the rev limit and learned to drive by the sound of the engine which was more enjoyable anyway.
