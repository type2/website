Subject: Re: [T2] Parts sent: Westy Tow?

&gt;From: &quot;Gerald V. Livingston II&quot;

&gt;Oh -- but I tow behind a regular pickup truck. behind a big box truck there
&gt;is going to be some goshawful turbulence knocking the bus around. Put it on
&gt;a trailer for that unless the entire suspension is top-notch.


Yes I think this is going to be the way to go. Looks like I am getting the 
'26 footer to move the contents of my house, the shop(less the parts cache), 
lawn &amp; garden, and the bus. I might trow a couple of straps over the top as 
well for safe keeping. I don't need any accidental popups on this trip and 
no seal around the top makes it seem more possible, yikes!

Thanks,
