Subject: RE: [T2] Oil cooler as heat source inside van.

I wouldn't relocate the stock cooler, you would be better off with a full 
flow tap.  Second choice would be a sandwich bypass for the filter.  Also 
make sure your thermostat is in place and working properly so the motor 
won't run too cool.  I'd use hard lines to the cooler along the frame, with 
flex lines connecting it to the motor where you can disconnect to pull the 
motor if needed.  Since you need more cooling in summer I would fab a steel 
box for the fan and cooler, and have a sliding plate that in winter mode 
would route air into the cabin, summer it would route it under the van.  To 
prime your system you would need to dry crank the motor untill you had a 
full prime, possibly disconnecting your return line to be sure you have a 
full prime.  Initially I would  manually prime with a tube and funnel.  Oil 
changes would also be a pain to drain it all down.  Once you determine the 
full volume of your new system you could just drain down, reconnect, dry 
crank for thirty seconds and you should be good.  The last thing you want is 
to run your bearings dry with a load on them.  On the bad/good continum that 
would be to the left of the scale.
