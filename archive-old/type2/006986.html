john anderson    wrote about his ability
to pull engines like they were taken out
by pulling a zipper. he didnt say if these
jobs were started with a running enging
and finished with a running engine.
ill pick up his challange, if the vanagon
engine is cold and fully hooked up
mySON can have the engine on the ground
in 45 mins. or less. total time to pull and
install hooked and running in less than
3 hours bring your van and your wager
and your &quot; official&quot; timer and well give it a
go round. this is the time for all good men
to come to the aid of their volks.
meet it &amp; beat it than talk big and ill
listen real quite and meek with my foot
in my mouth. our labor rate is $45.00
an hour the looser payes the bill.
if accept this challange come prepared
to pay about $140.00 for his time. if
by any chance my son can work with only
one hand you might come close or even win
then we would pay you the labor charge
and a 6 pack to go. maybe even offer a job
gentery for his son the wonder man &quot;kevin&quot;
