Subject: Update: Hoopty Doo

I received many more responses than I would have guessed in response to the
making of repop hoops for the SC/DC.  I was out at the metal shop yesterday and
reminded him about his comments and threat to make up some &quot;proper ones&quot;.  No
problem he says, lets bring it on.

He really likes challenges like this.  He brought out a stack of industry
magazines giving him coverage about the time he had reverse engineered an
ancient Ford part, cut it with his 60,000 psi water jet, then figured out a way
to press it in one operation.  All the other shops had turned his customer away
saying that it couldn't be done.

I'll keep the lists posted and those that replied to me specifically about the
hoops, have been bcc'd which is why you got two notes.

Scott
