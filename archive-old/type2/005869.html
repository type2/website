It looks like I am finally going to move forward with the camper.  I
 found
 what appears to be a great mechanic and now I need a good source for an
 interior complete carpeting kit as well as ideas for the headliner,
 should I
 go with a stock item or try a different source, such as some type of
 wall
 paper?.  Who has the best deal for those?
Please also if you the catalogs nearby, please send me the names/contact
#
 as I do not know which are best.

 Thanks, Alex&quot;
