Post did not come out the way I wanted it to. Must have been thinking how
I'm gonna tell the wife. :-) She says we have too many VWs now. Never. She
wants the new Beetle.

Anyway, I called the guy up on the phone since he lives some distance from
me and this is what he told me. He is also asking $1750 for it. I would love
to add this to my collection but could lose it in divorce court. :-(

It has also been brought to my attention by a couple of listmembers, that
the 1600 engine doesn't belong in it. The guy says he has the paperwork. He
could be wrong on the size. The only way to know for sure is to go look at
it.

I would love to get it but..... if anyone is interested in it, I could go
look at it or give you the guys phone number (he's out of town for the
weekend).

George if your stopping by this could be a nice diversion

&gt; I found a 73 Westfalia with only 50K original miles on it! 20K on rebuilt
&gt; 1600 engine. No rust. Was repainted with minor bondo spot from
 minor finder
 bender. Interior is in excellent condition. One family owner. Top
 is great,
 everything works. Has two cots. Runs great.
