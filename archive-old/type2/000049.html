I saw Thom has put the '55 Westy up for sale, asking $20k.  At first I said 
to myself &quot;no way&quot;, then I read he's got at least $10k in receipts alone for 
parts.

I thought I did &quot;good&quot; when I sold a '77 Westy for $4k.

Are you guys seeing Westys being bought for $10k and above??  That just gets 
away from my notion of a VW Bus being cheap transportation....for example my 
rusty yet reliable '70 for $400.

Just curious as to price comparisons around the country for nice buses.  The 
$4k '77 I sold was in Maryland. 

Good day,
Paul
