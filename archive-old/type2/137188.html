Subject: Save 70 bug from a good beating. :-)

My 1200cc standard VW has just decided the other day to sit and idle fine,
but will hesitate, pop through the carb on occasion, and stumble if you give
it any gas under load. It does better while sitting still, but under load
will display all the above symptoms. I can barely get it up a hill in 3rd,
have to go back to 2nd to get the revs up and stumble, jerk, cut out up the
hill slowly. I've replaced the coil, the points, the distributor and
everything electrical to no avail. (I have spare parts that are known good).
I checked the plugs a month ago and they were fine looking. There are no
apparent electrical shorts anywhere.



I am now suspecting it's my 28 PICT carb doing this? I cannot figure out
anything else that could be the culprit? Would appreciate any help on this,
I'm getting stumped. Timing, dwell, vacuum advance, and all electrical
appears fine.



Thanks,

Courtney
