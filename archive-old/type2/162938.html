Subject: Re: [T2] Annual smog checks coming to CA?

Ratwell warned:
&gt;
&gt;&quot;Legislation (A.B. 616) has been introduced in the California 
&gt;Assembly by Assemblyman Dave Jones to require annual Smog check 
&gt;inspections for vehicles 15-years old and older&quot;.
&gt;Could happen.  Help fight AB 616:

	But then a later msg said it's just an increase in frequency 
of checks, not a new imposition of checking.
	We don't have any such laws here (despite attempts by 
conservationists such as myself to instigate them).
	I can't judge at this distance whether you're likely to 
succeed in total resistance to the increase in frequency.  My advice 
is to view this exercise as an opportunity for counterattack. 
Whenever a powerful bureaucracy throws its weight around, the 'judo 
mentality' can lead you to bring about its downfall or at least a 
setback for the powe-crazies.
	What I would point out is that you might, in a rearguard 
action, advocate a compromise: less stringent (don't say 'more 
permissive' or 'slacker') standards, esp for CO and unburnt fuel, for 
the &gt;15-y-old vehicles.  I suspect you may be able to make a &quot;big 
sacrifice&quot; on NOx  -  if our airhowlers tend in any case to produce 
less of those than a modern motor.  It may turn out that you can act 
all righteous and say NOx can be nearly as good as for a recent 
motor, but CO &amp; HCs less stringent.
	One argument to urge is that keeping an old vehicle going is 
a considerable help against air pollution because to manufacture a 
new vehicle causes a fair fraction of all the air pollution that it 
uses in its whole lifetime, so once you've got one made it's a big 
help if you keep it going rather than junking it and demanding mfr of 
a new one.

	Could you mount a publicity stunt with Terri Hatcher or 
similar 'celebrity' driving up to Beeug Ornie's mansion or other 
convenient venue, preferably with a colour scheme similar to that 
featured in Little Miss Sunshine, to present your compromise?


Good luck
