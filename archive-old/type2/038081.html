Subject: 71 westy help needed

As I continue to slug along rehabbing my 71 Westy, i am about to
consider putting it on the road as a daily driver. Here's the problem:

PO had some electrical issues and it has a loom of wires hanging under
the dash. No evidence of any burns or other ugly but I need to know the
pattern of what goes where. Headlight switch is intact, but hanging and
if pulled, parking lights work but no headlights. Ignition switch is
bypassed and has a handy push button switch in the engine comp. (how
novel) BUT it starts and runs so nicely...

Sooooo, what I'm looking for is some direction as to where i can find a
correct layout for what goes where and i can rewire this puppy... No
fear here as it has maybe 20 wires and my Alfa 164 has about 20 miles of
wire! 

20 wires is a snap... famous last words.

Pointers? ideas? 

All help appreciated.
