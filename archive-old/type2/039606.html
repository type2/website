&gt;it possible that all of the draw from the various

More demand for electrons=more load for the generator=more heat=accelerated
wear=quicker failure.
In a word, yes.

Now for the
&gt;larger question:Knowing the situation, should I invest
&gt;in an alternator? 

If you must service higher capacity demands with add ons, you must increase
volume of electron creation. Add up the maximum demand for amps with
everything on, lights, heater, stereo items, DC vibrator for the passenger,
yadayadayada. Know that any alturnator of greater than 60 amp output will
put a much larger drain on your portfolio. Installing same defies the
concept of &quot;simple bolt-on upgrade&quot;. With proper Neandeering, it can be
done, with more load on the portfolio. First question to ask, how much load
can my portfolio handle? 

Note also to turn a 90 amp alturnator under full demand and load takes a
lot more horsepower than a 45 amp generator, therefore, demands more effort
from the motor, raising heat creation, reducing motor life, with less
horsepower for the driving wheels and a tighter belt to not slip, adding
more load to the alt bearings. Can you say &quot;synergistic reaction&quot;?

Try this test, when you get things going again. With motor idling and no
electrical consumers on, start turning on the various item. Note drop in
RPMs as load increases. Subtract full load RPM from no load RPM. Now you
have data representing strain on your motor and charging system.

With the popularity of 100 amp + stereos systems, the shops that sell and
service them as a specialty will be aware of the options available for huge
capacity charging systems. Give them your money and rely on their guarantees.

You could keep the generator stock and install an auxillary gas powered
GenSet, as another option.
