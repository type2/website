Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel pump question

&gt;&gt; If the pump is built into the block then it would be
&gt;&gt; the factory style pump used on 1.7 &amp; 1.8 liter engines

&gt; Sounds about right.  The replacement engine is an 1.8L.
&gt; That said, is there a rebuild kit for the pump, or does
&gt; it require a complete replacement?

I took a look at BusDepot_dot_com and few other online vendors
for a rebuild kit but didn't find one for your pump.
Maybe another list member knows of a source?


&gt; I've been considering whether I should go back to using
&gt; the stock fuel pump. It's probably safer than the electric
&gt; at this point (I need to rewire the electric pump with a
&gt; relay kit [I know that this is an imperative job, please,
&gt; no flames). Should I stay with the electric pump and make
&gt; it safe with the relay kit?

Wiring the after market pump for safety is a great idea
but I'm not sure how to properly go about it. Take for
instance the function of the double relay on a fuel
injected bus. When air is flowing through the air flow
meter (engine running) the pump runs. If the ignition is
ON and the air flow ceases (engine off) the pump shuts
OFF. The double relay monitors the AFM 'ON' signal and
controls the fuel pump power. Another current track
provides the pump power when you are cranking the engine
to start. You may still have the double relay since your
bus was fuel injected but the question is what will you
use to trigger the relay on and off? Power from the coil
wouldn't work because that would remain ON even in the
event of a car accident. Just food for thought. I'm sure
there is a solution. I can only think of some how using
the alternator current or oil pressure warning light to
trigger a relay....
