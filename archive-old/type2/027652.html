&gt; &gt; I have a 75 westy with an automatic transmission.  I am in the process 
&gt;of
&gt; &gt; rebuilding the engine now and it seems everything is broke.  When I 
&gt;first
&gt; &gt; bought it I brought it down to get looked over and the mechanic called 
&gt;me
&gt; &gt; saying the gear box was filled with red transmission fluid, it was 
&gt;leaking

&gt;???? not sure what you mean, the final drive had tranny fluid??

The transmission and differential had the transmission fluid in it.  I hope 
that this did not ruin it.  If the differential has been messed up will this 
lead to other problems (ie. ruining the transmission, engine, torque 
converter, etc.?

&gt;the gear box itself, the automatic transmission, is supposed to be full of
&gt;red tranny fluid (Dextron)

&gt;again not sure what part you mean, the torque convertor is connected to
&gt;the flex plate (which is connected to the crankshaft) by three tempered
&gt;bolts with large flanges on em...they go into a lug like projection on the
&gt;side of the torque converter,  if one of these is broken, the torque
&gt;converter is scrape metal, unless you are one heck of a weldor.  if you
&gt;are referring to one of the 4 mounting points for the engine to mount to
&gt;the tranny to hold them in the van, this may be fixable.

there were two parts that I took apart to get the engine out.  one was 
taking the bolts out that hold the drive plate to the something made of 
steel (I thought it was the torque converter, but I need to check on that) 
and the  other 4 bolts that are attached to a cast iron housing around the 
torque converter or what ever it is. (when i mounted it to the engine stand 
I used these holes in the engine to bolt it to the stand) This cast iron 
piece is what is broke... So you say it may be fixable?  Or do you think I 
could just replace the cast iron piece?

Thanks for the help.  I need all I can get.
