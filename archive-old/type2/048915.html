Subject: [T2] body shops in Long Beach

Hey Everyone,
I was wondering if anyone knows any good body shops in or near Long Beach,
CA.  I'm looking for someone that will repair all of my rust damage and
install new rubber for most of the window and door seals.  Your
recommendations are much appreciated!

Thanks,
Mike
