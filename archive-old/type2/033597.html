Subject: Coffee,  Porta-pottis, Heat was: Winter Camping

Drink coffee then the inevitable happens ....    

Coffee:
Have a &quot;Bodum&quot; I love but is glass and am afraid it will break when on
the road,  also have a many-several cup habit.  Loved the idea of the
filter dropping into my themos ..... will have to research that one. 
Have settled for instant coffee and hot chocolate etc. with boiled water
on the stove.  Years ago had a 12v pot but have found is not needed in a
westy with gas. 

The gal who asked about hot water without using stove .... they used to
make a filiment which hung over the edge of your cup and plugged into the
lighter socket.  Had one back about '75 and it worked great, wonder if
they still make one?

Potti:
I am on my second porta-potti, yup used one completely up over the past
18 years.  I like the shorter, lower versions which can fit under the
overhang of the bed when getting ready to sleep etc. and slide out to sit
behind the passenger seat at night.  

Have always been able to make it to a state operated wayside for dumping
purposes.  As I am getting to the point where my kidneys don't always
cooperate with long waits it is nice to be able to find relief anywhere I
can pull off the road for a few seconds on a trip.

Heat:
Join those who say a good sleeping bag and comely person are best heat. 
Just wish the little woman enjoyed cold weather camping as much as I do
... can't afford an alternate furnace as divorces cost more than a
sleeping bag.

Only use the kerosun heater -22,000 btu - to take the chill off while the
engine and BA-6 take over in the morning.  Main reason I carry the
kerosun is in case of break - down etc.  winter emergency heating.  Came
in handy at -25 F with a family filled van waiting 4 hours before the
next car came along a &quot;major&quot; highway in Michigan's UP about 12 years
ago.  ECU failed, no engine, no gas heat. stayed nice and toasty but had
damp windows, could live with that.
