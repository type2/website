Subject: Re: [T2] an urgent Cry for help!

&gt;Its a rip off to go the uhaul route unless its not to far of a haul. After
&gt;truck and dolly rental you gotta pay the gas bill to. The truck they make you
&gt;rent is HUGE, so gas milage bites. I speak this from experience. (Those at
&gt;Dead of Winter at Cloudland Canyon,GA will remember) Check SAMBA for a car
&gt;hauler I had a friend doing it for a while but he drives the big rigs now. You
&gt;can also ship it. A good friend of mine just had one shipped from Somewhere up
&gt;north to central AL. It wasn't to expensive. Just a few Ideas!!

Rent the big truck and stick the bus inside...

Just don't tell them that you are going to do that...

I prefer the car dolly concept.
