&gt; Hi Volks and Guru's
&gt; Today I pulled into a parking lot and looked behind my bus and saw a trail
&gt; of something. Got out and looked under my bus and saw a drip of gasoline
&gt; from the bottom of the heat exchanger on the passenger side. Formed a 8&quot;
&gt; puddle and stopped. Oh, thought I, fuel line problems, even tho they had
&gt; been replaced within 6 months. The fuel lines were dry as a bone. No sign of
&gt; a leak anywhere else but the heat exchangers.
&gt;  ------------------------------

Last week I removed my gas tank and found that the large hose that connects the
tank to the fill elbow tube was really loose.  The hose is connected to each
part with a hose clamp.  The clamp at the tank was so loose, I wondered if gas
had been splashing / leaking out.
Just something to think about....
