Indeed, the Neandereers who designed the lubrication and cooling systems
put in a huge safety margin, like any competant engineer would do, but more
so. In extreme heat conditions, 5% grade 100=B0F second gear, your oil will
break down faster. Just change it by inspection in shorter intervals under
those continuing conditions. Factory spec is every 4 to 6 weeks in extreme
conditions. You have to go back to the 60's Bentleys to find it. It is
still relevant to all the air cooled models, and prudent for most any Otto
motor.

Keep the motor compartment sealed and the timing and mixture adjusted.
Factory maintenance alone for continued longevity, including periodic
compression tests. When you see the weaknesses beginning in a cylinder,
continue on and budget for a rebuild sometime in the next year or 10k.
Replace it at your leisure. A proper factory spec maintained T-IV motor
will give over 200k before failing spec compression balance.
