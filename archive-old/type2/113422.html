simply urban legend. Here is why I can't follow this logic: &gt;&gt;

There's a grain of truth in the logic...IF you've been using non-detergent
oil (and why would you, but that's another fettle of kish), a change to 
regular oil might disturb the sludge you've built up in the sump and
might clog an oilway...This is, I'd guess, the basis for the myth of 
changing oils in midstream...Changing to a synthetic sometimes re-
sults in leaks in old engines (both time and mileage wise) for the same
reason, some synthetics have a higher detergency (tech term) than
petroleum based oils...(Just ask the owners of old Triumphs with rope
rear main seals... ;-(
