Hi everyone,
due to an upcoming move, we are selling our 71 westy.  It was a victim of an
engine fire last fall, slowly but surely we were putting it back together,
with some restoration along the way.
    Recent parts (new in box) are complete Sachs clutch kit, new german
exhaust system, and new dansk heat exchangers.
    No engine, but have old case (no good)  several good used heads one new
head, etc. etc. etc.
    By the way-has the childs cot, hammock and all camping equipment in
pretty good shape.
    Please p-mail me for more info and some pictures.
Thanks,
Paul
