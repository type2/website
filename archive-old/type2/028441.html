Yes I agree for the most part and over the years a conscientious mechanic
will develop a very accurate feel for torque values without using a torque
wrench...would make a good contest ;-)    However, when you run a repair
shop and you get to deal with someone else's ineffective empathic
relationship with tightening torques, sometimes the only way to know whether
or not to repair a suspected stripping stud/spark plug etc. is to use a
torque wrench and apply the factory spec.  AC VW fasteners are commonly
butchered by those only familiar with Detroit iron.  It's a Zen thing I
suppose.

All this torque stuff is starting to make me wonder how I got this
far in life.  I've been removing and replacing engine screens and
mufflers and spark plugs without a torque wrench for decades and
never stripped a thread or had a leak&lt;snip&gt;
