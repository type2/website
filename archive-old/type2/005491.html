Subject: Parts For Sale-Bug Out 50

'Morning Folks,
      I tried selling these at the Bug Out yesterday, but no luck. I entered
my Westy in the show, confident I'd at least place third (as long as only
two other buses showed, but more than two others showed, darn!) Anyway, I
have a Westy interior, Z-bed, rear cushion over the engine, all cabinets
except for the sink cabinet. The fabric is green/yellow/black. I'd like to
sell this as a package, but will split it up if I have too. I will not sell
doors or hardware separately because I feel that kills the value of the rest
of it. I also don't want to get into shipping, as the cabinets are too big
to ship at reasonable cost anyway. So, that leaves buyers in the Washington,
DC area. I will deliver for a small fee ( a beer or two) to anyone local. I
also have chrome headlight trim rings, off a '76. I will find more stuff as
I clean out the basement/garage. Please email me with any questions.   TIA,
Jeff
