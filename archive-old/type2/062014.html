Subject: Re: timing a boch 009 dist. fot 1600cc engine

&gt;or two). Brazilian 009's have about 21 degrees total advance at about 2625 rpm;
&gt;German, 24 at 2250. So, if you set the timing statically (with the little light
&gt;bulb, ala Muir, one side of the light grounded, the other on the negative side
&gt;of the coil, the one that goes to the condenser), you'd set the Brazilian at 7
&gt;BTDC (target of 28 total, so 28-21=7) and the German at 4.The advance curves

        Or, if you have a standard timing light, you can measure where your
full advance should be. Take the 7&quot; pulley, multiply by pi, divide by 360,
then you have the value of 1 degree. Multiply that by however many degrees
you want as your full advance (I run 30-32 depending on the local climate,
less for hotter climates), then measure that on a piece of paper or
something. Now, wrap that paper around the pulley, and mark the spot. I
used a file to scratch in 30 and 32, so I have both permanantly marked.
Easy. Just remember to say a word of thanks to your high school math
teacher-and Bob Hoover, who pointed this method out to me...

Peace,
