Subject: dual carb synchronization

I just unboxed a new set of dual carbs for my '71 Westy.  They cam with a
standard carb sync tool.  How the heck does this work???  I stared at it
for 5 minutes without being able to figure out how to sync the carbs.  The
carbs go on this friday and I'd love to be rolling by saturday at the
least.  Any help would be great.  Thanks!!
