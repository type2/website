&gt;&gt; Ooh, that's not good.  If a new sender doesn't fix it, then it looks like
you have either a very worn engine or bad pressure control valves. &lt;&lt;

Thanks George, you're scaring me.  This is a new case (seriously, only 2
miles), but not sure how many old parts were re-used.  The good bit is that
I handed the p.o. $300 US and towed Ms Jonze to the mechanic to get her
running (all the valves were between .001 and .002, dist was 180 off,
etc...).  She hadn't been registered for over three years and there was a
huge paper trail of p.o.'s.

I still think I'm gonna come out ahead.  Hear that, Claud?  You will too!
Fix your floor  =)

The engine seems to run fine (when the battery still had juice anyway,
hence, only 2 miles) and does not make any abnormal noise.  I'll swap the
pressure valve before I turn her over again and right after the generator
re-brush.
