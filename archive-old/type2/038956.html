Subject: Case cracks?

Hi all,

Just got Frances' engine down to long block stage and started cleaning off
24 years of grime.  I noticed immediately that the surface of the case is
covered in what appear to be small cracks that look like they've oozed
molten aluminum (my worst fears are embellishing the description somewhat).
Being a newbie, I'm wondering whether this is from the casting process or is
my case really toast?  Most of the cracks are around the distributor area,
and above the oil filler tube (the only areas I've really cleaned so far),
extending around the rear bearing housing.  The cracks are generally 1/2&quot;
long and raised enough that they catch and tear a rag if you drag it over
them.

Please tell me my case isn't garbage!  Or, if it is, where do I get a new T4
case?

Thanks,
Niall
