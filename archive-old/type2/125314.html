Subject: Re: [T2] Removing Fresh Air/Heating Levers?

&gt; This one has me kind of stumped. I need to pull the instrument panel to
 replace some lamps, but the trick to removing the plastic plugs that
 hold the levers in place eludes me. 71 Type 2

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

You need a little fork to pry them out.
68 to 72 use those horrible push-in pins.

73 (and maybe 74) used the same blue levers but no pins, they had a neat spring clip that went in 1st. The
reds are almost the same as the early ones, except they have a ridge on them like the 75-79 levers. [I guess
this is for blind drivers so they can feel the hot levers..... kind of like braille on the drive-up ATM] With
the spring clips, the 68-72 levers pull out just like the later ones.  The only problem with using 73 spring
clips on your 68-72: you need to find 2 buses to get them from since 73 and up only have 3 levers.

75-79 levers are totally different, they are female ended and slide on.
