Subject: Repairing Windshield Wiper Motor

Hello all,

Has anyone successfully repaired a stripped plastic gear in a VW windshield
motor.  The teeth aren't stripped, just the interface between the shaft and
the plastic gear.  If so, what adhesive did you use.  The local boneyard
doesn't have a late model loaf w-w motor and new isn't an option.

Jim
