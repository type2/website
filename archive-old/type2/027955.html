List,
Please forgive the list faux pax but...
You probably already know about these guys, - i met them in Maryland coming back from Boston.  They're driving a 75 (it's orange on the inside! ;])with a 2.0 and a single weber - check out the poptop...
They were driving to NY from S.C. for a photo shoot for 'Outside' magazine.  Nice guys.  My friends and i were having a scavenger hunt on the road - two of the things we were looking for were a VW bus and a GD sticker - these guys gave me both in one shot and i won the game.  Whee!
here's their site:
