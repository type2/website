I have already purchased the motor so its to late to go back.  I am in 
Germany and picked up a westy w/motor 2.0l.  It will be replacing a Fuel 
injected 2.0l  What is really required to do this.  I was supposed to get it 
done this weekend so I'd be ready for the Hochenheim Grand Nationals.  I know 
I have to disconnect a pump and run some fuel line but what's next??  Please 
reply only if you know how to do it not maybe this is how it's done. time is 
precious.
Peace Out
