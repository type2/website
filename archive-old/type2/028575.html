&gt;That would worry me..... had same problem when I got mine, ended up having to
&gt;re-do the entire brake system. Cost: $1200.00

$1200 would be the high cost if you had everything on the system replaced, I think. I have refurbed several brake systems, never spending over $200. I have not had to replace brake boosters, drums, or discs; but I've had to replace front calipers, pads, and lines and I *know* that cost was under/around $200. Parts only. I did the work myself.

Good luck! Joe
