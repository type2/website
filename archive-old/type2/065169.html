&gt;Thanx for all the info Joel. Since I do not hear a clicking sound I assume
&gt;my relay is defective (the dashboard lights dim briefly when I try to change

&gt;stuck relay.

I've never had a relay go bad in my bus.  Everytime something hasn't
worked, it was always because a wire came loose or some other cause.  Have
you checked the wiring?  The circuit is pretty simple - there is a small
(1.5mm?) wire going from your high beam switch (in the blinker stalk) to
the relay in question, and some larger wires going out of it.  The small
wire triggers the relay.  You should first check the small wire and make
sure it is NOT getting voltage unless you are pulling up on the blinker
stalk.  If that's okay, THEN I would tear into the relay, but I bet it
isn't.  You can also test the relay by pulling the small wire and touching
a known 12V source to the terminal where the wire was attached.  This
should switch between high/low beams.  BTW, this will only work if your
headlights are all the way on - if there is some problem in your headlight
switch, or if only the parking lights are on, the relay will not operate.
Ignition must be all the way on too, of course.  Good luck,
