Hey Cal, you probably should have explained why you do that for the newbies on
the list.

The pushrod tubes have a bellows type of area on each end of it and the head
compresses these bellows to help with the seal at both ends. Once you start a
couple of nuts, I usually do the two center inside ones in the rocker area,
there should be enough thread showing for the rest and then you can slip on
your washers and thread on all the nuts a couple of threads. Then you can pull
off your two starter nuts and put on their washers. Run up all of your nuts,
checking for proper pushrod tube alignment, and then torque in the proper
sequence.

Also, use the first nut or two without the washers, in order to start the
head going on. Then when You've moved it in a bit, remove the nuts and put
their washers on, then reinstall the nuts. Don't forget to torque using
the proper two patterns once all nuts and washers are on. Those washers
are special and cannot be replaced with any other washers. Be aware of
that.
