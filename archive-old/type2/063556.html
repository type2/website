Subject: rebuilding book?

        Is it worth buying that 'how to rebuild your air-cooled vw engine'
book or is Muir and Haynes enough?  From what I've heard the book is
excellent but I can't seem to find it anywhere and would have to wait 6
weeks for it to be ordered in.  I'm getting the rebuilding 'itch' and don't
know if I could last six weeks but would like to do a good job and am
wondering if maybe I should wait.
