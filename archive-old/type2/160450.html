Subject: Re: [T2]1700 change to FI?

&gt;First, thanks to everyone that p/emailed on this. I suspect if I 
&gt;asked the list if I
&gt;should keep on with the Weber 32/36 or go FI, the overwhelming majority
&gt;would say FI.

I must be the minority that would vote for stock carbs. The dual 
carbs were used in the UK
for many more years and there are vedors there who can provide them. 
But there are also a whole
bunch of other pieces needed, like the vacuum balance pipes, the 
throttle brackets and linkage
and the air horns and air cleaner and brackets. If you still have all 
the original pieces then
all you need are good carbs to go, but if you don't have all the 
ancillaries then that also would
have to be obtained.

&gt;1972 Westy (hapy) - no top engine hatch means lots of bruises on the
&gt;back of my head in the future :)

Consider that if you do go with FI there are several things that will 
also require mods.

1) ECU placement. I would cut and splice in the proper metal from an FI Bus.

2) Mount for the air cleaner. Same as above, splice in the correct 
mount from an FI Bus.

3) Rear deck hatch. I would forgo the Bus hatch and splice in a 
Vanagon hatch. MUCH BIGGER
and will provide for access to everything for service.

4) The components for the 1800 FI will not correctly feed a 1700 
engine. If you go with all 1800 FI
parts, you will still not have a proper mount for the head temp 
sender, and no FI head will fit
the 1700. Any method you use to hold the temp sender tight to the 
upper head will work, though
cold running enrichment may take longer to adjust due to slower 
heating of the sensor. This could
be bad news if you do a lot of short run driving.

5) Get the adjustable fuel pressure regulator from an early 914 
Porsche. Should be able to drop
the fuel pressure with that to tune the 1800 FI to the 1700 engine. 
Using an exhaust gas meter, set
the mixture screw on the AFM to about 2 turns up from bottom, then 
adjust the fuel pressure regulator,
reducing pressure until the mixture leans out. Then use the mixture 
screw to make the final adjustment.
Another way to go is use the injectors for the 1600 T-III FI motor 
and increase fuel pressure for the
1700.

6) You mentioned the fuel tank before. Easiest to rob one from any FI 
Bus rather than trying to convert
the original carb fuel tank.

In the end, new stock carbs from the UK will likely be less costly, 
and when set up properly that 1700
will run like a champ, just like the engineers who designed it 
thought it should run like.
