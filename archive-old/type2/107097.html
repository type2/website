Subject: Re: [T2] Front sway bar mounting

I got my 7/8&quot; front sway bar from Bus Depot. I also got the mounting kit,
which included new clamps as well as bushings and (I think) bolts.
Installation required some elbow grease, but vice grips should help.  BTW,
the bushings in the kit did not have a split along the side to allow
installation over the sway bar, but I called BD and they told me how to slit
the bushings. The big sway bar makes for very nice handling, well worth it.
