Howdy,


I just found a '69 tall top camper (Adventure)

It is white, original paint and interior.
Belongs to an old couple in their 80's! Original owners.

Anyway, I have not owned one of these.

WHAT should I look for as fas as being there and functioning, the
description on interrio sounds good.
I know what to look for as far as the bus goes, I'm looking for advice
pertaining to the ADVENTURE stuff.  Any accessories it should have that the
guy will havein the garage???

Any advice appreciated.

It sounds like a good one, it will cost about a week or twos pay.
