Bus Fallout 2003
Cuivre River State Park, MO

Ah, fall season. Busses. Cold weather. Well the year's camping season
has winded down, but I wasn't ready to call it quits yet. So when Steve
announced that there would be at least one more camp-out I was all for
it. It only took a bit of work to get Steph to agree to camping in cool
weather, well that and a promise that elect sites were available so we
could plug in the heater.

Thursday packed up Butch with a bit more winter items, and got to use my
new roof rack to hold a bunch of stuff that usually just clutters up the
inside of the bus. Packing was much easier this time due to this. I
can't wait to get around to welding up a rack for the front. Realized
that I have yet to test out the elect hookup so tested that with the TV
we were going to try and bring for the kids and everything worked
fantastic. Made a few supply trips around town and finished up ready for
the next day. Friday I worked till around 1 then bolted out. I get home
to the twins obviously happy about going &quot;campin in bue bus&quot; again. So
we finished packing our wares in the bus and off we went, putting down
the road to pick up Wyatt my oldest at school.

I wheeled the bus into the now pretty deserted parking lot (did I
mention we were already 30 minutes late). Wyatt was pretty happy to see
us pull up, so we left all the happy smiles of the kids watching the bus
drive off and off we went, no really I mean it! Drove north toward
Clarksville on Hwy 48 then hopped onto I-24 west. Ran into some rain on
and off but nothing really major. We took a pit stop outside Paducah for a
quick bite. An hour later we pull out again.  only once for gas.
As we started to roll into St Louis the weather got a bit nastier. When
the lane markers are not reflective and it's raining it's really hard to
tell what lane you are in. 

The next major landmark was quite impressive, at least to me. We crossed
the Mississippi and I got a great view of the arch at night. It's really
quite an impressive structure. Finished the last leg of the drive making
a few wrong turns and finally finding the campground. It was about
midnight and we were all tired. The temp had been dropping the entire
trip so everyone was tired and wasn't exactly looking forward to opening
up the bus to setup camp. I drove down to the non-elect sites and saw
Steve's Scricco and Dave's Vanagon. Drove a bit more and didn't find
anyone else. We drove back to the elect sites and picked a great site
close to the restrooms. Got settled in and started getting ready. I
plugged in and POP. dangit! Kept tripping the breaker. Something was
wrong with the wiring that checked out just last night. I gave up and
eventually just ran an extension cord into the window to hook up the
heater. We finished getting settled and around 1 hit the hay.

Morning came and I was ready for some fire building. About 6 I started
on the fire. Got it going decent and finished setting up camp. On my way
to pay the park I met up with Darrell and chatted with him a bit. After
sharing a couple cups of coffee (thanks Darrell) and checking out his
Eurovan Winny I went and paid the park. I spent the rest of the morning
meeting the few that showed up to brave the cold and making the family
some breakfast burritos. 

Everyone gathered and looked at everyones new toys. By mid morning we
were up to 2 EVC, 1 Vanagon, and 1 split. Strange to be outnumbered by
the new campers, but we managed to survive. Lunch brought sandwiches and
more talking. Bill ? arrived sometime that day to camp in his gray
vanagon. A bit later a 2000 EV rolled in. I believe the fellows name was
Bill also, but can't quite remember. He just ran across it on an email
list and drove up to check it out. Gary called and gave me an ETA of
3-4ish after he finished up some home chores. I spent the rest of the
day hanging out, taking toddlers to the restroom, and watching all 3
kids play. Unfortunately Steph forgot to bring something for her to do
and since no other wives/gf made it out she didn't have a whole lot to
do. But she did relax and try to stay warm. It never did seem like it
got as warm as was predicted, but it was a pleasant day.

As the sun started to set Steph fired up the stove to cook some chili.
Dave had gone for some family event, and Bill had to leave quickly when
his wife was in an accident (minor). That left 2 EVS and 1 split. While
finishing the chili Steve and I heard that distinctive sound of
something air cooled coming this way. It was Gary arriving in the dark
after a few wrong turns of his own. He settled into camp and quickly got
setup. The rest of the night was spent chatting and visiting around the
fire. I introduced the procedure of making smores to Darrell who had
never seen that before. Gary went to his bus and produced a new toy of
his. A lime green guitar. We spend a little while listing to Steve pick
a bit which added a nice sound to the campfire talk. 

Everyone turned in about 10ish. The next morning while everyone was
packing up the campground lady came around and was giving us a fit about
having 2 campers on the site. We tried to reason with her that they
actually were passenger vehicles, but in the end she didn't seem to buy
it. Steve tried to get it straightened out, since every year the rules
seemed to change. A bit later the ranger came out and spent a bit of
time trying to explain it. He was quite reasonable and not a jerk about
it, seemed like he was just having to enforce a stupid rule, and knew
it. by 11 we were all ready to head back east. Said my byes and loaded
up. beep beep we were off.

On the drive back things went very well. It was a beautiful day. The sun
was shining, and the temps were up to at least 60. We putted through St
Louis, and considered stopping at the arch, but decided to putt on
toward home. The rest of the drive home was nice and uneventful. We
pulled into homebase around 8 ready to rest in our own bed. The bus ran
great all the way there and back. The SW heater was fantastic. I still
have a bit of exhaust smell, but when I seal up the windows real good it
goes away, so I suspect it's still something in the exhaust path
leaking. Thanks go Steve for putting on this little shin dig. We had a
great time. It was my first time west of the Mississippi driving and I
really enjoyed the change of scenery. and for once I finally was the
person who drove the farthest!
