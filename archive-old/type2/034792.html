Subject: Three '76 Westy Questions

Hi All,

 After reading one of those &quot;make-your-dreams-come-true&quot; books, I
decided to put my dream into reality.  So I took a tour of the
undersides of my 76 Westy last night taking inventory of all the rust
problems.  The van hadn't been driven in 8 years.  While under there, I
noticed a 1/2 inch or so hose connected to the front of the master
cylinder.  It was loose and had no hose clamp.  As the brakes worked
fine when I last drove it, I am wondering what it is.  I am assuming it
is the vacuum line from the engine but this is the first time that I
have ever seen a vacuum line for a power brake booster connected to the
master cylinder rather than the vacuum reservoir.   As I couldn't get
into a position to see the entire vacuum reservoir to verify my
conclusion, I am wondering if someone can help.

Second question; I need to starve off the rust process until I can save
up the $$$ and get the thing to a reliable body shop to weld in a bunch
of rust repair panels and paint it.  I don't want to have to scrape it
off in order for them to weld the body panels on.  The more labor
required of the body shop, the more out of pocket $$$ for me.  The
archives suggest the use chain saw bar oil for rust control.  I need to
know if will it interfere with the welding process.

Third question; this camper originally came from Rochester NY and has a
tar-like undercoating on it.  Our VW dealers locally (Albany NY) used
Quaker State undercoating in the 70's and which was tar-like.  The
Rochester guy might have done so too.  Some of it is peeling off, but
much of it is still stuck on pretty tight.  Has anybody developed a
method of removing old undercoating easily?

As it is too cold, dark and snowy out there to work on it during the
winter, I am doing my home work now and with the intent of doing the
mechanical work in the spring when it is warmer.  The camper was parked
due to extreme slop in the steering (1/2 a turn!) caused by rust in the
front axle and lack of $$$ to fix it.  I still lack the total number of
$$$ to fix it, but with the list's help that baby will roll again.

Thanks in advance,

Dave Kinerson

76 Westy, rusty
PS I think that the rust repair process will require at least one of
every rust repair panel ever made!
