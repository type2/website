Subject: Parcel Tray Wanted
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hello,
    I own a 1977 Westfalia and have been looking for a
bamboo parcel tray for under the dash.  I was offered
one for $25 bucks, but I didn't e-mail the guy back
fast enough.  I have also seen a repro that is not
bamboo and it's a little too expensive.  Then I got an
e-mail saying that they don't even exist.  Does anyone
know of any for sale or any information about them? 
Thanks a lot.  I really appreciate the help.

Peace,
Tim
