Subject: Sloppy shifter

 Hello list-members,

My friend has a 1981 bus with a shifter so sloppy that he hits my knee with
it when he shift gears. Is the mechanism much different from my 1971
Kombiwagen? At least the rear joint seems to be hard to reach. Is there any
bushings back there or should we just try at the front end first? 

Please help, my knee is numb:-)
