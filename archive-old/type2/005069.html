Hello,

 I'm new to this list. We live in Seattle.
 I stopped by a local VW parts supplier today and asked what a rebuilt 78
van engine with new heads would cost me. He said  $2200.
  This left me wondering why the $1000 difference between that and the
prices I see for rebuilt 2 liters on the web and in the magazines .
   I asked him about this and he claimed that the cheaper shops use &quot;junk
parts that the Seattle rebuilders would not use.
   So I'm asking you: what kind of luck have you folks had with the &quot;mail
order&quot; rebuild shops?
  I would really appreciate a few tips on any good rebuild shops since our
78 will be needing a new 2 liter sometime this year.

Thanks for your time,
Neil Sundberg
