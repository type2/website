Subject: Re: [T2] No Oil Sender

If this is a type 1 type engine it is a possibility that you have a 
&quot;commercial&quot; engine.  These were put on water pumps/generators/ etc...  
I have seen these engines in articles but have never actually seen one.

&gt; Hi Guys,
&gt; Have a 56' single cab that someone in the past put in a 1600. When 
&gt; pulling the motor to freshen it up, I couldn't find the oil pressure 
&gt; sender. Upon pulling the motor found that the oil pressure sender area 
&gt; was never tapped. There's no machine marks, plugs, etc, anywhere for a 
&gt; oil sender. Any ideas what this block came out of ? Motor runs great.
&gt;
&gt; MANY THANKS,
&gt; Jim In Nashville &quot;Music City&quot;
