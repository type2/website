Dea Mike,

I replaced the canvas on my '78 Westy with one I bought from Ron Salmon 
at The Bus Depot. I have been very satisfied with the result. It's 
orange, very much like stock, except it has zippered side windows in 
addition to the front facing window. I consider that a distinct 
improvement in form and function, but it is not stock, strictly speaking.

I found a few other versions of this for sale, but no one could touch 
Ron's price. No one (that I recall) made a late '70's poptop replacement 
canvas that did not have the extra side windows.

Last year I posted to type2 list about my experience doing the 
installation. Following is that posted, dredged from the archives.

Drive safely,
Surfer Bob

17: 
18: Howdy Volks,
19: 
20: Hallelujah! I have finally completed installation of my glorious new 
21: poptop canvas (thanks Ron) on my '78 Westy. May the Grand and Mysterious
22: Spirit of the All in All be praised.
23: 
24: Yea verily I say unto you all, I have had every type of difficulty 
and setback
25: in installing said canvas. Here are a few of the pitfalls I discovered,
26: for your consideration in future canvas projects.
27: 
28: 1- The bugmesh goes on the OUTSIDE. Keep this in mind when initially 
securing
29: the canvas with a few staples lest you do it inside out.
30: 
31: 2- If the vinyl strips around the inside top have gotten too hard to 
drive 
32: staples through, improvise one of the following solutions: 
33:       a- Use 3/4&quot; carpet tacks. I went this route.
34:       b- Cut 1.25 inch wide strips from those long, vinyl vertically 
hanging
35:       window louvers and use those in place of the petrified vinyl 
strips.
36:       c- Get the thickest duct tape made, make a triple layer of the 
stuff       
37:       in a long 1.25 inch wide strip, and use that in place of the 
petrified 
38:       vinyl strips.
39:       d- Gain the use of an industrial type stapler, either electric or
40:       pneumatic. Even the gnarliest spring-loaded hardware store stapler
41:       probably isn't up to the chore.
42:       e- Boil the strips in water to soften them just before stapling.
43:       This might work, but I didn't try it.
44: 
45: 3- You have to unbolt the support arms from the poptop in order to deal
46: with the front left and right edges. When unbolted, the arms can be 
carefully
47: propped in the front corners of the top to support it. When so 
positioned, 
48: the poptop is lifted about 1/2&quot; less high than usual. If you staple/ tack
49: A
50: the upper edges of the poptop without accounting for this, the whole 
front
51: end will be too short once you have reconnected the support arms. 
Leave 
52: yourself some extra room to account for this or you'll have to 
unstaple/ tack
53: the top edge, let some out, restaple/ tack, and forevermore deal with
54: a row of holes along the top edge that will remind you of your folly 
55: from now until the end of time. (Ask me how I know.)
56: 
57: 4- There's not much room to work when screwing down the rear portions
58: of the canvas. An electric screwdriver may not fit back there without
59: a swivel joint. Small handheld screwdrivers may work better.
60: 
61: 5- It helps to use a sharp thing (an awl or nail, or tack) to poke holes
62: through the lower edge and find the screwholes beneath before you start
63: trying to drive screws in.
64: 
65: 6- It takes a deep socket (or otherwise small outer diameter) socket 
wrench
66: to unscrew the nuts holding the square metal bar to the inside front 
ceiling
67: of the poptop. And you must remove this thing to get at the front 
edge of
68: the canvas. Check it out and be sure you have the right tool before you
69: settle down to do the job.
70: 
71: In summary, the folks who installed your original canvas at the 
factory had
72: the benefit of doing hundreds and thousands of these. But you will 
probably
73: only do one, so you won't have their practice and skill. Work
74: slowly, allow more time than you think it will take, and better a bit 
75: loose than overstretched.
76: 
77: BTW, I scrubbed 20 years of mildew off the inside of my poptop while 
doing
78: the canvas. What a difference! Worth every bit of soapy water running 
down my
79: arms and into my shirt as I worked overhead, although I cussed a lot 
at the 
80: time. 
81: 
82: As soon as the rain stops, my wife and I are going to go camp in the
83: bus again to celebrate. Yippee!
84: 
85: Drive safely,
86: Surfer Bob
