Subject: Re: Fuel pump autopsy

&gt;  Did it run cold, but not hot?

Started out that way, sort of. The problem (lack of power especially
on hills) was intermittent. But then got to the point where it
happened all the time.

A replacement pump fixed the problem. Also resolved some idle issues.

It's started happening again now though. You may be right about the
pump rod being short, though all that rust was more than likely the
cause. This pump was a mess when I got it so who knows.

Doesn't matter. I ain't doing that job again. I'm slapping a facet
piece'o'crap on there this weekend and ordering a nice Holley pump and
regulator next payday.
