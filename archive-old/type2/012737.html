Subject: alternator mounting pedastal

i just put a new alternator in my '71 1600.  i had to take off the
alternator pedastal to get the alternator and fan out.  i bought new
gaskets for the pedastal, and reinstalled it.  here's my problem:
i accidentally installed the deflector _at_ the base of the alternator
pedestal upside down.  should i take everything apart again and reinstall
it correcly, or does it really matter?  i'm thinking that it wouldn't
really make any difference, but i'd appreciate any input.  thanks!
