Subject: Re: [T2] Re-awakening

Hi, I have a rusty gas tank too. What is this cement mixer trick? I looked 
at relining the tank, but at the price of that, I'd rather not!

Bernie,
Fort Langley, B.C.
'77 WESTY!

&gt; The 77 Westie officially moves to the running list, clutch works, brakes 
&gt; work, drives and runs just fine, and I haven't even tuned it up yet.  Took 
&gt; a little while to flush the fuel system.  BTW, the gas tank strapped to 
&gt; the cement mixer trick is fantastic.  I didn't have any gravel, so I used 
&gt; some rusty old bolts, and I not only got a like new on the inside gas 
&gt; tank, but I got like new bolts as well.
