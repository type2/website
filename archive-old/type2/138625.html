Subject: Looking for assistance in Everett Washington - Take 2 

Thanks a bunch to everyone who has expressed help so far.
I hope you don't mind that I send another request to both lists.
As the amount of money I'll be sending him for the part for my Double Cab is 
a lot for me at least, so I'm hoping to find out anything I can about the 
guy.

Miles was great enough to find the name of the shop (which I neglected to 
get).

The owners name is Vince Voss and the name of the shop appears to be 
Autopia.

Has anybody had any dealings with this individual and/or can tell me 
anything about him?

Thanks Much
Kevin
