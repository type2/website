Subject: Re: [T2] Gold leafing a bus.

Gary - drop me a p-mail and we can get together
sometime and I'll show you the stuff we use on signs
and 'splain the process. The shop I work at is in
Bellevue. It would require some clearcoat on a
vehicle. If you're familiar with the Kirkland Parks
signs, many of those are gold leafed with no clear
coat. The ones we have refurbed in recent years and
all the new ones have been painted with metallic brass
paint to save $$ but you can sure see the difference
the way the gold is always bright. -BaH

I'm going to start sanding down the paint on my bus
this week and  
fixing a few dents.   My wife thought that gold       
     leafing a few of the  
rusted chrome pieces would be a nice look.   Does
anyone have any  
experience doing this?  I am wondering if the gold
leafing kits you  
can get at your local craft stores would stand up to
the weather in  
Seattle.
