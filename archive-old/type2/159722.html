Subject: Re: [T2] Tire Chains How-To

&gt; Pretty nice.  My method when I head up to the Sierras is to mount the
&gt; chains on my spare wheels in my nice warm garage.  It is a lot easier to
&gt; swap two wheels than it is to reach up inside those dripping, slushy
&gt; wheelwells to secure chains!  :)  If the weather looks threatening, I take
&gt; the hubcaps off so I have one less thing to worry about.

I agree that's a great page!  I like to be able to steer in the snow 
also... so I generally put chains on all four wheels.  Real chains on 
the rear, cables on the front.  The cables are so light and easy to 
handle, they hardly take any time at all to put on.

&gt; We actually had snow here in SoCal a couple of days ago.  Real,
&gt; honest-to-gosh flakes were coming down for a few minutes.

Yep, that made national news!  Here in Dallas we had a nice coating of 
sleet last Monday and since then it's just been raining.  :-(
