When I was in Cuba a few months back I saw a lot of these Mexican buses
running around. I took a peek under the hood of one at the
transverse-mounted, in-line 4 engine setup. Very slick. Someone should
fabricate a mount that would approximate this arrangement. But then you'd
have to create all the plumbing to run coolant lines to the front-mounted
radiator. I never got a chance to ride in one but I bet they are nice.

&gt; So many people are always talking about how they wish they could import a
new
&gt; bettle from Mexico ( as opposed to the New bettle )   I know there are
&gt; several people doing that now but is anyone doing the same thing with the
van
&gt; ? I went to the VW of Mexico web page you can click on english langauge
and
&gt; they have a page on the combi looks like the T2 type 2
&gt;
