&gt; &gt; the rest of you and i hope someone has some tips for me to stop this from

&gt; &gt; happening.  Thanks.

Thieves will seldom break in without a reason, which is usually tools or
electronics that are inside the bus.  Keep that stuff out of sight.  If
you have a kewl stereo, put it in the glove box and slap a non-functional
Radio Shack POS in the dash hole.  If you have tools, cover them up, but
don't make it look like you are covering them on purpose.  A blanket
carelessly thrown over the back seat and the tools on the floor doesn't
arouse attention, but one carefully tucked around a rectangular box will
invite trouble.  This is a situation where window tint is a good thing, as
it makes it harder to casually observe the contents of the vehicle.

The bad news is that a lot of breakins are from people who already know
what they will find, which means that they are friends or acquaintences.
Sad to say, but a healthy dose of paranoia is good to have.

It's also good to have a doberman inside the bus, but then you have to
deal with the animal rights folks!
