Subject: The Saga of Mario Gavazzi comes to a head?

Someone mentioned to me (one of the NC Moonies) that Mario Gavazzi is  
finally getting his arse handed to him in court for some of his most  
recent crimes.

I checked up on The Samba and read about it today...John C. had  
previously sent me his own story.

How did Mario manage to get away with so much of this crap before  
finally get hauled in?

Just wondering...

Wow.

Anton
