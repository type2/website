Subject: Re: [T2] Electronic ignition and a melted lollipop

Hi Beth,

I was wondering who got those. I would reccommend &quot;Simple Green&quot; cleaner, it
should be available at Walmart. It's an excellent all-purpose cleaner.

I got those seats with the 79 bus that became my westfakia, and when Steve
Dolan made a set of 79 seats available for exchange of brewskis, I passed my
seats along right away rather than drag them all the way home again. And
since I got them for free, it just would NOT have been proper to sell them.

Happy trails,

  &gt; Ok, my four year old daughter left a lollipop on the front passenger
  &gt; seat of my 78 bus and it melted into the cloth upholstery.  True, it is
  &gt; my fault; I should not have given her the lolli, but these seats are new
  &gt; to me, given to me at Everybus 2002 by some nice guy whose name I
  &gt; forget, and I want to get this junk off my seat!  Any suggestions?
