seen people put their foot in their mouth, but never seen anybody hit
themselves in the face with a pie before. nice shot.
related bus comment: for the last six months i have been on a world-wide
mission to uncover the mysterious differences between the vent wing seals
on the transporter middle window, and those on the rear cab windows of
68-71 crewcabs. after a time i found most all reputable retailers,
dealerships and aftermarketeers i could find (every one you can imagine
online, and a bunch not) said there was a difference; that the transporter
seals were not appropriate, specifying among other things transporter seals
would need to be cut and re-glued. vendors in the u.s, canada, belguim,
germany, and italy said they hadn't seen both seals together to compare,
but were sure there were differences based upon the fiche. with the help of
one heroic listee from austrialia i received two seals from a doublecab
vent wing. i find absolutely no visible differences between those he sent
and loose transporter seals in my stock pile. a rumor is that a type2 owner
paid $100 EACH for crummy used crew vent wing seals. yee-ow. in the early
stages of my search a few listees wanted to know what i came up with. here
ya have the short story.

during the research i found retailers were looking at the fiche and noting
different part numbers for transporter and crewcab seals. my conclusion to
date says the part numbers could be different but the parts are the same. i
concur with karl: wasted time, wasted expense, and being on the other end
of someone's lack of passion for doing the right thing is a bummah.  - steve
