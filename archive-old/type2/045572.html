Ron,

Here's some information from list posts and manuals.  

&quot;CA&quot; transaxle was used through the 1972 model year. This one seems popular 
with off-roaders for dune buggy tranny conversions.  Its tough and geared 
low.  There was a &quot;mountain&quot; geared version of this, the CB, and also limited 
slip versions of each of these, the CC and CD.

&quot;CN&quot; and (maybe &quot;CM&quot;) type 002 transaxle was used in 1974 and 75 with the 
1800.  They had different gearing.  

&quot;CP&quot; type 091 transaxle was used from 1976 - 79 and had gearing designed to 
take advantage of the additional hp of the fuel injected 2 liter engine.  It 
is a desireable trans. for any bus upgraded to the FI 2 liter and is 
definitely a &quot;freeway flier&quot;.
