A friend of mine is involved in a project to build a harley that runs on 
Biodiesel for a person involved in the Biodiesel industry, the customer 
wants everything he owns to run on Biodiesel and he has a lot of money, but 
the funny part is that in order to get a harley to run on diesel without 
exploding they are starting with a $50,000.00 top fuel motor, of course we 
are talking about VW's and not some POS harley. 

If I could run my Harley on Biodiesel I certainly would. And as for the POS part, I have had it for 4 years and not a drop of oil or an engine issue - those Jap parts sure do the job!
