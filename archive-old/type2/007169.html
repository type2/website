Well, I've been over this engine (recent rebuild) and I can't get the
freakin thing to run smooth or hold an idle.  This is the first time I
have had trouble like this in an engine I've rebuilt.  But of course you
learn something new with each one. 

I installed a set of 41 heads from Mofoco.
After driving I found a persistant oil leak.  Thinking it was the tubes,
I pulled the engine to reseal them.  The leaking continued. Upon closer
inspection of the head I discovered a manufacturing defect that allowed
oil to drain right out from the bottom of the rocker arm area. I
purchased a new head (I couldn't return the defective head yet because
it was still on the engine) and this solved the problem. 

I feel I'm going to have to pull it again based on the compression
readings I took this past weekend.  I never checked the compression
ratio with these new heads thinking they were probably the same volume
as stock.  Well the readings may confirm what I fear most.

cold compression test
#1 - 129
#2 - 128
#3 - 121
#4 - 115

Warm compression test
#1 - 119
#2 - 123
#3 - 111
#4 - 106

I just set the valves so they should be alright.  The engine lopes as it
idles.  Though it has a mild cam (I don't know the type), It doesn't
have that performance cam type lope.  Idle adjustments will not raise
the engine speed above 850-900 rpms.
Can anyone help me out.

Thanks,
