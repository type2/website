Subject: In the spirit of Christmas

Hi Volks,
	This being friday, and Christmas eve I'd like to wish each of you peace and 
satisfaction in your lives.  Even if Christmas is not your holiday, I hope 
that  you will be able to get into the spirit of it and show love and 
compasion to those around you as well as deriving great pleasure from the 
people in your lives.

	May the wheels on your bus go round and round.
