Subject: Re: [T2] Re:  Cost Effectiveness of Points Replacement
  Conversions?

From James Hayden:
&gt;  get with the late
 20th Century and go Hall cell and be happy, instead of being a slave to
 the yoke of early 20th Century oppression.  There's none of the
 unpleasant bending, endless incremental adjustments/rechecking with the
 dwell-meter, or poodle-wrestling that accompanies forking around with
 points anymore...

With this in mind, the 79 Calif bus/80-83 Calif Vanagon uses electronic ignition that is an almost drop-in
swap and uses VW parts that are available most everywhere....
When an aftermarket unit fails, you are stuck unless you have a spare with you.

&gt; And don't get me started on about why I prefer hydraulic lifters to solids either...

I prefer driving my bus rather than working at it on weekends:)   So I go for upgrades that give me driving
time.....  I do enough wrenching 8 to 5 Monday to Friday.  That is why I do less-maintenance upgrades. The
Vanagon self-adjusting rear brakes are an easy swap. The VW electronic ignition is an easy swap. But boy did I
get a lot of mail about the hydraulic lifter swap! Take a stock VW solid cam and a stock VW hyd cam to any cam
grinder and have him see if he can find a difference in the grinds between the two type4 cams. He can't
because they are identical. BTDT! Look in the Bentley, only the auto trans cam has a cast ring on it denoteing
it is for an auto trans engine. All you need are a good cam to start with and then swap the lifters, pushrods,
and the spacers between the rockers. I use very good USED VW lifters to keep the metal hardness the same. I do
not use aftermarket lifters because of the hardness difference. In the 100,000 miles I have on my 77 engine
since I rebuilt and did the lifter swap, I have had one lifter collapse about 5000 mile ago. When I replaced
it with another good USED one, the collapsed one was still convex. ZERO wear. I know everyone says you cannot
mix-match lifters and lobes or you will accelerate wear but as long as I used VW cams and VW lifters, it is
NOT happening. My engine has 100,000 and my daughters engine has 150,000 miles on the same swap. That is
250,000 mile combined on USED parts that are not supposed to be combined. Sorry if anyone disagrees, but it
works for me and it seems to work for all the others that have tried it. It appears that it does not work for
the people that haven't tried it!!

Bob Hoover recently replied to a post about hydraulics recently on the air-cooled newsgroup. It was concerning
hydraulics in type1 but it still pertains to type4's:

&quot;1/18/04

&gt;Hydraulic lifters require exacting tolerances to work properly, but as the
&gt;engine is air-cooled rather than liquid-cooled, the operating tolerances
&gt;can't be met due to the wide temperature range.

---------------------------------------

The above is pure myth.

Air cooled aircraft were among the first applications of hydrualic cam
followers (ie, 'lifters').

The various 'drop-in' hydrualic lifters for VW engines (CB, etc.) didn't work
simply because the right side of the engine receives ALL of its oil via the #2
cam bearing web and the supply was simply inadequate for the 'corner' lifters.

Equally mythical is the tale about poor high-speed performance from juicers.
Testing crate engines from the Puebla plant, two with solids and one with
juicers, the latter dyno'd 3hp above one of the others and 5hp above the other,
apparently because of the constant zero-lash on the valves.

Couple that with the fact juicers do not require periodic adjustment... plus
the fact all modern engines use them... and you really have to work to find a
valid reason for not using them.

But of course, all that violates that lovely 1930's-era Conventional Wisdom
that sez hydraulic lifters are bad, bad, things.

Thinking for yourself is a barbed wire T-shirt and clean-climbing an icy rock
face.  Following the herd is a warm, fuzzy blue blanket.

Take your pick.
