&amp;gt; OK, it is a Uniroyal AWF all season tire, Type C, 1435lb at 50psi, 195/75-14 6 ply tire.
&amp;gt; How's that?

&amp;gt; AWF???  Does not show up anywhere..... AWP is probably what they are.
&amp;gt; &amp;gt;From what you list, it appears to be the 1st tire listed here:
&amp;gt;  http://www.tirerack_dot_com/tires/Spec.jsp?make=Uniroyal&amp;amp;model=Laredo+All+Season+AWP
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Type C has me puzzled with a weight rating of 1435.....  1435 is too low.
&amp;gt; That is the range of passenger car tire weight.
&amp;gt; Minimum for your bus is 1540 lbs.
&amp;gt; The 93 Load Index puts it at 1433 lbs.
&amp;gt; Not sure about 90Q........If Q means speed rating, the max speed is 99 mph.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; 6 ply is the tread area.  What is the sidewall rating?

Nope, 1435 is the number.  The lower profile tires have less load capacity
than the taller profiles.  A 185R14 in load range C will have sufficient
load capacity, but if you want to run a 195/75R14 you have to get load
range D to get it.

The sidewall of virtually any radial tire you'd put on a bus will be 2
plies.  The tread will be four plies, two of which are steel.  The varying
strengths come from the design of the plies, not the number.

The ply rating is a vestigial leftover from the transition between cotton
plies in tires and synthetic.  The synthetics were a lot stronger than
cotton, but people were used to judging the strength of tires by the
number of plies.  They'd go past a 4-ply polyester tire and buy a
weaker 6-ply cotton tire simply because 6 was more than 4.  The &amp;quot;ply
rating&amp;quot; was invented to help sell the synthetic tires.

The _real_ number to look at is the maximum load in pounds.  That number
isn't as subject to twiddling as the others.
