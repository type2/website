&gt; AFAIK, there is no difference in the engine/trans setup between late
&gt; (2.0) bays and the 2.0 AFC Vanagons, so there should be no
&gt; interchangeability problems there. It's when you get into
&gt; post-late-'83 watercooled stuff that you start running into problems.
&gt; Also, I may have missed something here, but the only Vanagons that
&gt; ever had 5-sp trannys were Syncros, and in that case first gear was
&gt; only a &quot;granny gear,&quot; leaving essentially four useable speeds.
&gt; Otherwise, all manual Vanagon gearboxes through '91 were four speeds.
&gt; Oh, and please correct me if I'm wrong on any of this...

The only successful 5-speed transmission transplants I have heard of  
are Porsche transmissions (with the 914 transmission being the  
easiest to adapt).
