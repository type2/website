Rex:

I can recommend AVP for a rebuild on your engine.  I used them last year
and am happy with the results.  You can check the list archives to get more
info on AVP but mostly I've heard positives on them.  I have no experience
with Boston Engine so I can't comment there.  The new Mexican (beetlemex)
engines are type I engines.  As far as I know, there are no new type IV
engines available, so you're going to have to rebuild.  You might want to
consider rebuilding with an 1800 or 2.0 L with hydraulic lifters.
