Subject: Removing fan bolts?

Sometimes I wonder if I'm the only one who has the problems I
have..searching the archives didn't seem to turn up anything so here goes..

Is there any special trick to removing the 3 allen bolts that hold the fan
on a 1700cc?  I have a folding allen key set, perhaps they're not long
enough (not enough torque?).  I can get the wrench in ok, but it doesnt seem
to want to turn.  The wrench just kind of slips around..I also noticed that
it doesn't seem to be a very deep hole.  I don't want to strip these guys
since I can't imagine how i'd get them out if I did, so..any magical tips?

Thanks in advance!
