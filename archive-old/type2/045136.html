Subject: [T2] Stalling at deceleration

I decided that Friday would be risk day and pressed the heretofore local
only 1967 deluxe into long distance service. We made the 200 mile round trip
to the DMB show mostly without incident. However.....

Twice we experienced an annoying problem that I recall coming and going once
before but dont recall if it was this motor. The subject is a 1600
DP,009,34pict3, black coil, seals and tin in and in fine working order.

When the bus is well into its operating temperature range it stalls upon
deceleration. For example, Running at 45 miles an hours and approaching a
stop light I slow down in gear, put it in neutral and it dies. Turning the
ignition over and it dies. Turn it over and give it some gas(say about 1500
RPM and it is fine unless the idle is dropped down agin in neutral. Under
load at any RPM and runs like a top.

My first guesses were vac leak, bad or disconnected cut off solenoid but
alas there is more. If the bus stalls on decel(say approaching a stop light)
I put the bus into 2nd and pop the clutch to bump start it. Voila it fires
up and idles just dandily! Furthermore it did not stall at all for the next
300 decels to idle while negotiating a bumper to bumper Interstate traffic
jam. After the show it did not do it at all in the parking lot. The problem
recurred up arrive home(100 miles later) and getting caught in Downtwon club
traffic. 

My guess is this is carb related as all the ignition stuff is new but I have
not gotten around to rebuilding the carb. Any thoughts?
