&gt;&gt; Hi folks
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;       Awhile back I remember someone talking about
&gt;&gt; a type II mechanic or engine builder in Wayland MA.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Anyone remember or know the name of the company/individual?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;    I believe the fella you're looking for is Bob Donalds of Boston Engine
&gt;exchange...
&gt;
&gt;    www. bostonengine_dot_com  or (508) 653-7229
&gt;
&gt;    He is currently building a set of Big valve typeIV heads for me...

Bob is quite a guy.  He is currently writing a book on the various
aspects of rebuilding the AC Type 1 and Type IV motors in conjunction
with Gene Berg's son (whose name I can't remember right now).  He did
a bunch of dyno-based work last year and will do some more when
the winter work-load drops off a little.  To unjustly oversimplify his
work and findings it seems he's ending up on the side of signficantly
reduced compression (7:1 and lower) with well massaged heads for both
usable power, lowered heat and longevitiy/reliability.  This all reminds
me of a conversation I had with Leonard at AVP last year.  I think their
Type IVs come out with a CR of 6.5:1 in some cases.  

Just passing on what I've heard...
