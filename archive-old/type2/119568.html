&lt;&lt; Anyone know where you can get 195R14 tires?
I saw some on a guy's bus at EveryBus a few years ago, and I want some.  I 
think they were load range D.  And it just so happens that I will be needing 
tires before too long.

Anybody in the UK or Europe know what's up with the soon/could be laws 
limiting
the use of tires by time rather than just remaining tread...? From what I 
under-
stand, there's laws in the works to limit the age of usable tires...
