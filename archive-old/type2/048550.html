&gt; On the dutch vw bus list this question was asked earlier and everyone said
&gt; that the windshield is the same throughout the years the type 2 bus was
made
&gt; (68-79).

Hello everybody, I was at a local junkyard today.
Now I have a 68 westy and I was
wondering if a windshield from a newer bus will fit with no problems.
