&gt; Grrrrr.  Was washing my 78 VW T2 ASI/Riviera today in

No, but it only has to happen once to ruin your whole day.

Your windshield is a laminate of layers of glass and plastic.  It is not
tempered, so the glass can crack easily if stressed.

If the glass is warm and you put cool water on the outside of it it
shrinks the outer layer of glass, putting it in tension.  If there is some
imperfection (minute scratch, chip, etc) to provide a stress riser a crack
will propogate.

I never wash a windshield in the sun if I can avoid it.  I put the bus in
the shade and wait for the glass to cool all the way through.  Then I use
water of the same temperature or a bit warmer than the glass.
