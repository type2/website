Subject: Re: carb gasket sealant


&gt;I don't want to use any of the usual
&gt;Permatex, Loctite, or other sealants because they dry out and are difficult
&gt;to remove. I would rather use something with the constency of wheel bearing
&gt;grease which will remain viscous but seal against air leaks.
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone have a recommendation for a product which will do this but will
&gt;not attack gasket material?

Roofing tar?

Actually the non-Ultra Permatex will &quot;pill&quot; and clean up pretty easily if
you drag your finger over it. This is the blue stuff in the blue tube, not
the blue stuff in the silver tube which is much harder and more rubberlike
(and much superior for most applications I think, but not carb gaskets).
