Subject: Re: [T2] Fw: fuel injected motor won't idle

Have you checked for vacuum leaks?  What it sounds like might be 
happening is when you start the car, the cold-start valve is giving 
extra gas.  But after about 15 seconds it turns off and now you're 
running stricly on the ECU.  However, if you have a vacuum leak that is 
somewhere after the airflow meter, it will allow the vane in the AFM to 
close and thus inject less fuel.  This would probably be more pronounced 
in colder weather because you need more fuel when it's cold out.

So, if you haven't already, change all your vacuum lines and/or make 
sure they're all nice and snug.  You can also check for vacuum leaks by 
spraying starting fluid around your hose joints.  If the RPMs go up 
momentarily when you spray, you've got a leak.

Hope that helps!
Mike

&gt; Hey Volks
&gt;   I have a problem with my 75 bus engine that I can't figure so I thought I
&gt; would invoke the wisdom of the LIST.
&gt; The van fires up fine and idles fast for about 15 seconds and then suddenly
&gt; the rpm dives and it stalls.
&gt; Once it is warm it is a bit better but it still stumbles and hunts and
&gt; sometimes still stalls. It also misses a bit at high rpm highway driving
&gt; (60-65mph).
