Subject: Possum

Seeing all these busses with names on the list I started thinking about one
for mine. I wasn't having much luck until last night. I worked late and got
my case assembled, all glued and torqued up. I drove home from the shop and
when I got in my girlfriend was already in bed. She had left the back door
open just a little so our cats could go out to the back yard. (a 20 x 12
foot fenced in patio) We live in a townhome in Arlington, VA. I closed the
door and went to bed... Around 3:00 am we both heard noises downstairs,
maybe a mouse, zzzz, louder noises... I get out of bed to go and see, go
downstairs naked, and there sitting in my living room is an enormous
possum. I open the door and try to shoe him out into the cold and all he
does is hiss at me. I try to move him with a broom and he just gets madder.
Then he charges at me and my freaked out girlfriend and runs between our
legs and up the stairs towards the bedroom. Its now almost 4:00am and we
both have to work in the morning. I go upstairs and find our friend in the
office room, I shut the door and locked him in. I call animal control and
they won't come till 6:00am. Try to sleep for 2 hrs as the sucker is just
trashing my office. Finally the animal control women shows up, she says aww
he's just a little one, grabs him by the tail and walks out of my house
carrying the sucker by his tail. My girl doesn't think we should name the
bus Possum but I'm thinkin I'll at least call the engine that. Any
thoughts?
