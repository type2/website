Subject: Farfignugen!!

Hey guys, 

	Just wanted to say thanks for all the help and advice you guys have
given me the past week. I really appreciate all the advice. I am on a
similar mailing list for my Pontiac Fieros and this is just as good as that
list (that's a compliment). It's really nice to see people sticking together
on a list.. dealing with tons of e-mails a day just to help people out.

I also wanted to mention that... I'll be completely honest, I never thought
in a million years that I'd be buying a farfignugan... I really just bought
it for my fiancee. But the more and more I look and work on this car.. the
more I become enamored with it. Even though everyone that sees me working on
it thinks I'm a tree hugging hippie... I still think this car is totally
cool. 

I can't wait to get this sucker MINT and back on the road!



Thanks,
