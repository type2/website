&gt;Volks,
&gt;
&gt;Well, I am about crapped out.  Snake eyes all the way :-(  I too the bus
&gt;to Foreign Affaires in Albuqueque, NM.  they fixed the immediate problem,
&gt;which was ignition related, but the bus is still getting too hot for my
&gt;tastes, plus on the way out of town, I got a new growl at slack throttle
&gt;(between acceleration and deceleration) which sounded very CV'ish to me,
&gt;but could be anything.  I came back and am staying the night in
&gt;Albuqueque.  I have an AM appointment at Foreign Affaires to look into the
&gt;problem and an oil change (2200 miles since DC, and about time.  I am
&gt;headed for the chat room after posting this (irc.type2_dot_com), until they
&gt;kick me off the library computer here.


It's hard to diagnose your problems long distance, but it sound like you
need to go back to stock 94 mm P &amp; C.  If you feel adventuresome and want
to proceed in this direction, I think we can tear into that thing and get
it kosher while your visiting your brother.  Also there is a external oil
cooler available on the donor bus in my driveway.

If you need help, call me.  I'm headed for Moab and Monument Valley,
wednesday Am so I could drop down to get you if necessary.

Remember SH*T happens.  And on a VW Bus it's an adventure!
