&gt;It is one piece, as you describe.  There should be a plastic strap with a 
&gt;snap on it, located on the front passenger door rear pillar, that holds 
&gt;the bunched up curtain while driving.  While camping, the rear edge of the 
&gt;curtain can be fastened to the screw eye on the tall coat closet at the 
&gt;rear of the sliding door.  It is a slight PITA to bunch up all that 
&gt;material for driving.  I suppose you could work out some other arrangement 
&gt;if you prefer.
==================================&gt;
NewBus has all original curtains with all the original holding affair.
Casper has newly made curtains.

For the side door, I prefer Casper's new curtains which stow completely 
away when not in use, and are held in place by magnets when needed.

Just my thought on both considerations.
