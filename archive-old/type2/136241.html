Subject: Re: [T2] Genuine Hella Tail Lenses on Sale - Housings being   
  discontinued.

&gt; Thats pretty weird as this tailight is also used on
&gt; Mercedes vans and maybe VW LTs,
&gt; Maybe Hella will make them in one of their other
&gt; worldwide factories......

The units of the Mercedes vans might look the same at
first glance but are in fact different! I tried it
once on a junkyard to fit the mercedes lense on a Late
bay and it didn't work. The difference is in the
position of the red reflector and the tail light. The
Mercedes unit has them the other way around.

The LT model was in production from 1975 until 1996,
but I doubt if the last LT's of this model still had
the exact same units. The first ones were that same
for sure. An Early LT carries a load of Baywindow
parts like seats, door handles, steering wheel,
sliding door mechanism, etc.

Yours,

Vincent
