Hi Aaron.
I have a 74 Westy that came from Longbeach Calif. with the top finish worn 
away exposing the fibers. I was told that the &quot;outer&quot; gel coat of resin is 
put in the mold first, and would be almost impossible to re-apply and get a 
smooth surface like new as the original gel coat was applied to a smooth 
mold surface. So, as recommended to me by corvette body man, and a canoe mfg 
co.,
I gently sanded the top to remove most exposed fibres, then applied 2 part 
epoxy primer. allowed that to dry and gently sanded the exposed fibres 
again. I continued this so i had 4 thin coats of primer,sanding between each 
coat to remove any fibres, then applied a coat of white paint, allowed to 
dry and gently sanded the fibres again, and then a final coat of white 
paint. This turned out very well and is still holding up like new since 
1992.

&gt;   The poptop itself is in bad shape. The previous owner told me the bus 
&gt;had lived much of its life in Arizona.  The finish has been warn away 
&gt;exposing the fibers.  A friend of mine who works on boats for a living told 
&gt;me i can reseal it with a good coat of fiberglass resin.  I am just curious 
&gt;if anyone else has ever had this problem and what did you do to fix it.
&gt;Thanks
