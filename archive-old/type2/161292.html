Subject: Re: [T2] Rebuild just one cylinder? Cam? Bigger valves?

The FI VW engines mix the gasoline and air very close
to the intake port / valve area. The higher velocity
of air helps to mix the fuel more completely plus it
causes somewhat of a ram effect, possibly cramming a
bit more fuel mix into the cylinder at low speed. Note
that the buses designed with carburetors had larger
valves. The mixing with a carb occurs at the venturi
area of the carb where airflow is restricted and thus
velocity increases. Once the fuel is mixed, there is
no further need for restrictions so bigger valves
actually help.

Back to FI: Once the engine speed has increased, the
air velocity has increased also, thus making bigger
valves an advantage as in a 914 head on the same
engine.Busses have a lot of weight and a low gear that
really isn't very low so a lot of low end torque is
really needed for the average driver. Did I answer
your question? -BaH

 could someone expand on the idea that the 42x36
 heads w/ a stock cam
 would likely reduce low-end torque and &quot;might&quot; make
 up to it on the
 top end.
