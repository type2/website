Subject: found a weber

hey well good news and bad news...
i found a weber but the guy wants 200 dollars for it...
says only been used four times...
\bad news i dont have that kind of money so gonna see what i can work on here..
might be able to come up with it just got to talk to the wife though..
doubt i will be able to afford it though...
maybe i will get lucky and someone will have another one..

well update on the bus so far so good she is spitting a little but still getting down the road..
although i have found out the hard way that i do not have a emergency brake... how can i fix that?

i pull it and it grabs some but still roll...
have to hold my foot on the brake and keep it thottled up to idle and all is a pain in the ass when you are sitting at the top of a hill.. LOL'

seriously though still got good vibes about high country i hope they are right and we can make it..
i just hope i dont forget my carb cleaner...

peace
