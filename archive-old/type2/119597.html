&gt;Hi all,
&gt;Just wondering what the thread size is?
&gt;I have just received new heads for my re-build (2L type 4). As mine is dual
&gt;carb my old heads never had a cyl. head temp sensor. The new heads have a
&gt;thread (blind hole) next to the No 3, No 2 spark plug which I'm guessing is
&gt;for the temp sensor on FI bus's???
&gt;I just want to know what thread size it is. It looks like M10x1 but am not
&gt;sure.

Yep, M10x1
