Subject: Re: [T2] Broken EZ Out &amp; adventures in replacing the rear
  brakes on a  '69 Bus

&gt; One of the capscrews that holds the adjusting screw bracket had the head broken off by someone who

&gt; out broke off inside the drilled hole.  There isn't enough of the EZ out hanging to grab ahold of,

As you have found, the EZ-out is very brittle, since is is made of
extremely hard metal.  A drill won't touch the EZ-out.

You might be able to use the brittleness to your advantage by taking a
punch and whacking the EZ-out with a hammer to break it up.  If you can
hit from the backside, so much the better.

If this fails, and you can get the part off, find a machine shop that does
EMD stud removal.  The EMD machine literally dissolves the metal
electrically, so it doesan't care how hard it is.

One somewhat related question:  Has anyone successfully used an EZ-out, or
are they just sad jokes on us amateur mechanics?

I find it to be cheaper in the long run to take stubborn studs to a
machinist before I gotch them up too much.
