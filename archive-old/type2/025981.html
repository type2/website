Clutch release bearing?  Darn.  29 years old, but only 73K distance gone.

I am hearing a a whine, pitched at approximately middle b-flat, when I mash
in the clutch.  Goes away when I let it out.  I am presuming that it is the
clutch release bearing, no longer smoothly spinning.  My guess it that it
will get worse and worse pretty quick and will maybe seize and break my
fork.  

Now Bentley, on page 50, in section 15.4 (see Fig. 15-12), mentions drilling
a small hole in the transmission case and spraying molybdenum lubricant on
the bearing:

&quot;The clutch release bearing is a maintenance-free item.  However, if it is
noisy, the plastic facing should be lubricated through a hole drilled in the
transmission case as shown in Fig 15-12.&quot;

&quot;Use a spray can of molybdenum disulfide lubricant with a plastic hose
attached to its nozzle.  Insert the hose through the hole you have drilled
in the transmission case and direct the spray against the plastic facing
ring.&quot;

Is this a legitimate thing to do?  Any of you folks do this before?

I am not sure that I will not discover a hole already there, but, man, do I
need lots of encouragement to get the gumption up to be drilling a hole in
my transmission case.

What ideas do you folks have?  Will this be OK for a while?

Should I immediately yank the engine and replace all clutch components?  The
clutch action is great, does not slip, etc.

Thanks for any feedback,
