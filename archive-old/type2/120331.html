Subject: Original seatbelts (was: New items and interest)

&gt; Yep. We plebes in the states only got seatbelts
&gt; rated for pickup trucks it seems. I've seen a lot of
&gt; photos of those belts but never one of the reel. I'm
&gt; really curious because many late busses had no
&gt; bulkheads.

Do you mean the &quot;roll-on-automatic&quot; seat belts? They
don't need extra mounting points. You can fit them in
any T2 made from august'67 until 1979. The only
problem is that the &quot;roll-on-automatic&quot; thingy is
mounted with a piece of metal that makes a 90 degree
angle with the top of the wheel well. That's all.

These automatic-roll-on seatbelts were mainly ordered
on German buses. I don't want to bore you with
M-codes...but I'll do it anyway ;-)

M525 - The USA/Canada-only seatbelts
       (were these 2-point during all
       the modelyears?)


M184 - 3-point Seatbelts in cabin
       with roll-on/off automatic
M549 = 3-point seatbelts in cabin
       (these must be horrible without
       the 'automatic' you are really
       strapped in possition)

&gt; Also, it seems as if they use the same swivel-loop 
&gt; at the top as the Vanagon used, with a stand-off to
&gt; get it past the lip on the door post

This was an original setup, also on the T2. So no
worries I guess.
