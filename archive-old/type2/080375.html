Subject:  Proposal for new abbreviation: NMD. (fwd)

Volks,

I am forwarding the attached because (a) it's Friday and (b) some of you
may work in systems administration and (c) I think it's an acronym we need
around here as well.

VW specific applications include:

the bus is fuschia below the belt line and yellow above it (NMD);

it was a 9-passenger but the divider was cut down to make it a
walk-thru (NMD!).

NMD's link very naturally with DPO's (dreaded previous owner), of course.

A second proposal would be to include SEP, from the Hitchhiker's Guide
SEP = Someone Else's Problem (with the subtext that it may come back to
bite you :-)

ex: &quot;The tranny used to pop out of fourth, but I sold it to my cousin, so
it's an SEP.&quot;

&gt; I've seen the following pattern in a few messages lately...
&gt;
&gt; &quot;I'm using the following products: [series of products, some of which
&gt; are, shall we say, less than ideal]. They are configured as follows:
&gt; [details, some of which are also less than ideal]. No workie. I know
&gt; it's less than ideal but I can't start over, I have to make it work
&gt; pretty much as is. Help!&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Usually there is also a strange mantra uttered,
&gt; &quot;noootmaaaaaaaideseeeeeeshuuuun&quot;, which in context seems to be an
&gt; incantation intended to defend against evil spirits which would cause
&gt; others to lose respect for the utterer and potentially to lecture the
&gt; utterer on how far from ideal their situation is, in case they are
&gt; unaware.
&gt;
&gt; I think it would be simpler (and potentially far more humorous) if an
&gt; abbreviated form of this mantra were to be used: NMD.
&gt;
&gt; Example:
&gt;
&gt; &quot;I'm working with a client who has standardized on Windows for
&gt; Workgroups [NMD]. Their current setup involves 4000 desktops in 88
&gt; locations worldwide, all of which are bridged together [NMD!], and each
&gt; of which is set up as a single ethernet segment using 10Base2 [NMD, NMD,
&gt; NMD!!!].
&gt;
&gt; &quot;LAN performance is less than ideal. The WAN links, which are OC-48
&gt; connections [NMD], seem to have some capacity available, but the LAN is
&gt; swamped from about 7am to 10pm (employees work long hours in order to
&gt; get any work done, since the LAN is so slow). After hours it's a little
&gt; better.
&gt;
&gt; &quot;I tried changing one office to 10BaseT and installing a switch but that
&gt; didn't help much. (Actually, the first switch I bought was defective; if
&gt; I didn't know better I'd swear it was actually perspiring. I bought a
&gt; slightly more expensive one and it seemed to be OK.) I think it has
&gt; something to do with broadcast packets coming over the WAN connection,
&gt; or maybe the LED's labeled 'COLL' on the front of the switch - I don't
&gt; know what that means but it's on all the time so I'm wondering if that's
&gt; related to the problem. BTW, I can't upgrade the OS on individual
&gt; machines, but I can change LAN equipment including network cards, hubs,
&gt; switches, etc. Any ideas?&quot;
&gt;
&gt; :)
