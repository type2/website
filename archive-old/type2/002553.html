Listees,
With all the hot weather I decided to check and make sure my air flaps were opening correctly. Got under the '71 and took off the shroud, right side bottom and voila!, no thermostat. Should I be able to see flaps from there? How does the connection work? I've seen the '79 system with the cable etc but this is a mystery to me.

I've read the recent emails about flaps etc. but still have questions.
