Subject: Fuel gauge wiring

Hey Volks-
My fuel gauge has never worked and I just figured that
it was easy enough to fill the tank and track my
milage, works great until you start putting in partial
tanks of gas. Yesterday I was crawling around, under,
inside my bus and found a broken wire, so I tracked it
into the fuel tank compartment. I opened it up and
found that it was connected to the top of the tank,
and there was another wire that went from the sending
unit to a ground. Now, my question is, where does
should this lose wire go? I can run a length of wire
up to the front, but where to from there?
I looked in the archives but couldn't find the answer,
Bently and Muir speak of a fuse. So does this wire go
to the fuse box? and where to from there? Help.
BTW this is a '73 bus.
Thanks 
-Kent
