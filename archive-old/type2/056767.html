&lt;&lt;I just bought my first bus two days ago, and I can't figure out what this
knob does.  It's green, on the passenger side, and it has a diagram of a
coil on it.  When you pull it out, it lights up.  Neat, but I wonder what
else it does.  There's also a hole to the right of this one, directly under
the glovebox.  Looks like it used to have another nifty knob, but I'm not
sure.  &gt;&gt;

Green knob is for your rear window defrost  The hole under you glovebox is a
European 12V accessory outlet.  This is where your original Coleman tire
inflator would plug in.
