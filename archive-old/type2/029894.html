&gt; Haven't posted in a long time but I try to keep an eye on what is going on.
&gt; I have what I think is wheel bearing noise in the front end of my 72 Westy.
&gt; I hear it when I turn   but not when going straight. I took one hub apart
&gt; and all is well. However I can't figure out how to set the play that is
&gt; supposed to be there. Haynes says .03 -.12 mm at the spindle.  It also
&gt; says: &quot;This seems like a lot and can result in some quite noticible rock at
&gt; the outer rim of the wheel&quot;
&gt; How much rock? Does anyone have a procedure for getting this right? If
&gt; there is that much play maybe the bearing noise while turning is normal.

Nope, it shouldn't make noise!

I tighten the nut by hand until snug and then back it off until 
I can just move the washer under the nut.  Tighten the allen screw and
you're done!  I think that this is the Muir Technique.
