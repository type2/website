&gt; I was actually thinking it might be good if it was the Washington/Baltimore
&gt; area VW club...or something...'cause the neerest Clubs were in Southern PA,
&gt; down in VA, and over in Salisbury, MD...  Although I don't know if we'd go so
&gt; far as to say &quot;Cheasapeake&quot; though... thats a very big area... of
&gt; course...maybe that is what everyone will want ;)

how many are going to Everybus, I plan on driving down 301 early friday
morninng, but maybe we could discuss it at some point down there.

&gt; The only trick with is with dual host cities is working out meetings,
&gt; etc....Could have separate meetings, then occationaly have one combined
&gt; meeting...  That way it's easier for people to make the meetings... :)

well they are only 34 miles apart, but we could rotate quarterly between
DC/Baltimore/Annapolis/ and in the middle in Columbia

&gt; Of course if someone were interested in running a separate club, I'd be
&gt; willing to host the site...
&gt; 
&gt; But as much as I know everyone on the Type2 list is eagerly waiting to see
&gt; what happens next, this should probaly be descused further on the websites

I know I don't have the time to run this and have been waiting for someone
else to volunteer.....;8*}
