&gt; just idle curiosity at the moment... but is there any looming hurdle 
&gt; to converting an upright (1679cc T1) to MegaSquirt? i mean, i am aware 
&gt; i need to collect all the relevant fi bits, but will it be possible to 
&gt; put it on a bus that originally had a NON-fi motor?
&gt; i'm mainly guessing there might be some electrical components or 
&gt; wiring that need to be spliced in :)

It should be totally doable.  You should be able to get the necessary 
FI bits (injectors, fuel rail, air plenum, fuel pump, fuel pressure 
regulator, intake runners, throttle body, air cleaner [though 
Megasquirt won't use the AFM]) from a '75-or-later Beetle.  You'll have 
to modify your fuel tank to provide a fuel return line.

Note that some of those Beetle FI parts might be identical to Bus FI 
parts (fuel pump and pressure regulator are likely suspects).  I 
believe the injectors are also the same, with the exception of the 
small bit of hose they come with to connect them to the fuel rail.
