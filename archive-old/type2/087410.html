Subject: Re: [T2] BN4 Heater Testing

Whenever the air gets to a certain temp the whole thing shuts down. No fan, no fuel pump. My understanding is that only the fuel pump is supposed to shut down, but the fan quits blowing too. Is that how its supposed to work. I didn't think so from what I have read in the library.

Thanks
Casey
