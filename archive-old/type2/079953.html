Here is the website for the Engine Dolly that John Hartranft drew:
http://www.72camper_dot_com/dolly.htm

Please don't edit the drawing. If you think we need to change something
email me first and we'll do it.

Hope you enjoy it!

&gt; Rob -
&gt;
&gt; &quot;Do you know who I give credit to for drawing this? &quot;
&gt;
&gt; I would be entirely to blame.
&gt;
&gt; By the way, that one listee made the point that even .pdf's can be hacked,
&gt; which I naively didn't know.  If you can put a write protect on the file,
&gt; I'd appreciate it.  If not, no harm done.  Put it out there and let's see
&gt; what happens.  I'm getting a lot of requests for it tonight, and I'm just
&gt; Reply-ing to them and attaching the file, which I have here as well.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for all this effort you're going through.  If you're ever this way,
&gt; or go to the Auburn Hills show in the spring (VW of NA hq), give me a
shout.
&gt; I'll buy the first round.

&gt; &gt;Do you know who I give credit to for drawing this? I am 99% done with the
&gt; &gt;webpage for the dolly.

&gt; able
&gt; &gt;&gt; to contribute doing what you like to do.
