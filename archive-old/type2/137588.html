Subject: Re: [T2] Bussing on &quot;winter&quot; gasoline

I lived in MD for 7 years before moving to Chicago.  Can't recall days 
where the air temp was below 0 F, but I'm sure it happened and I'm sure I 
didn't go outside that day :-).  But I lived in Annapolis which has very 
mild winters, certainly compared to the western part of the state.

Yeah, the wind chill in Chicago is brutal, but when the thermometer in your 
backyard reads -18 F, you start to wonder why man has chosen to live in 
such a climate.  Corresponding days of -35 to -50 with the wind chill yield 
the same thought process.  The only thing Chicago has going for it in the 
winter is that it is on the Western side of the lake.  We get much less 
snow than Michigan City or St Joes since the east side gets all that lake 
affect snow - just like Buffalo.

&gt;we occasionally get the (-F) here in MD too, just not usually quite as
&gt;windy as Chicago though
