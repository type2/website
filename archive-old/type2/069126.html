&gt; I have no idea about the intircacies of your fuel injection so I don't know

The 009 is an aluminum bodied 019. The 019 was *stock* on T2s until '58
(US). It (009) was the core of the *screamer* ignition kit. I find it
hard to accept that stock equipment is unsuitable. I will admit the T4
engine is different from my upright, but you can't excape the limits of
an air-cooled engine; to much timing = too much heat.

The 009 is worthless with the 34PICT3 carb unless you rework the carb
completely. The carb is jetted too lean for the advance curve of the
009. If you run 40 with an 009 and a 34 you won't keep your new engine
to long unless you have done some serious jetting research; IMHO ;&gt;)

For your 74 the data you relate gives a total of 20 deg advance from
your stock dist.      36 (total) - 16 (static) = 20. 


For a US manual tran, factory timing is 5 ATDC;  that = 15 total (using
your data):

          5 ATDC (-5) + 20 = 15

Now I screw around with mods all the time; but I do a lot of reading and
proceed slowly. I would not run 21 deg more timing than stock without
some serious research and testing. 
            
Part of the demise of the air cooled VW was the fact that to pass
emmission standards, they had to lean out the fuel mix. These lean fuel
mixes cause the engine to overheat and reliability is lost.


Just some ramblings about timing and fuel mixes.;&gt;)
