WARNING: Nearly all the late model aircooled type 4 engined, fuel injected buses
I have seen with A/C that were in the junkyard, that did'nt have blown engines,
were BURNED TO A CRISP!!  I have a '77 Westy that HAD a/c ( &quot;had&quot; being the
operative word) and suffered the same toasting, but fortuneately the inferno was
contained to the engine compartment and the rear hatch area and now the bus in
undergoing rehab for 3rd degree burns, as well as getting the rearmost cabinets
out of a donor westy of the same vintage. ( the PO had a FI line blow loose
going uphill with the A/C on in near 100 degree temps).
 The aircooled engine was never really designed to have all kinds of belt driven
add ons running off it , it works hard enough as it is,  which is why all the
late buses that had A/C's , had the system that was installed aftermarket ,(
though &quot; VWOA&quot; approved ), at the POE or at the dealer upon request. The late
bus A/C system used a York compressor, a huge one, made by York mfg of York ,Pa.
and was the same one,basically, as the one used on big heavy American cars of
the '60's &amp; '70's. (a buddy of mine's '66 Galaxie a.k.a. &quot;the whale&quot; has one
just like it on his)  It just put too much strain on the aircooled engine. A
friend of mine has A/C on his '79 westy but  had the compressor disconnected and
removed long ago, after the PO of his bus blew the engine as a direct result of
the A/C compressor's load on the engine.. He still uses the dash  blower though,
to blow fresh air.  Honestly, I have seen many many late buses with A/C but not
one of them had functioning A/C systems, they were always intentionally rendered
compressorless.
IMHO, if you want your engine to last for a long time, then skip the engine
killing A/C system and get yourself a set of electric fans ( try Barney's
imports, They make some neat fans to fit in the fresh air ducts or to mount
under the dash that put out an incredible amout of airflow).  With all the
jalousie windows open and such you get a substantial amout of airflow.
