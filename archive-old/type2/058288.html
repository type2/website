Subject: air flow over cyl 1,3

To Craig + list:
I agree with Craig regarding the airflow around the rear of a &quot;breadloaf&quot;
shape- (I call it a &quot;vacuum effect&quot;-try driving with the bus rear upper
door open and it will be obvious that exhaust fumes are being happily drawn
in to assail your nose.  It's always the first clue someone forgot to close
the darn hatch!  So much for the theory that while traveling down the road
you are &quot;driving away&quot; from the heated air and exhaust let out below the
engine!   I'm not so sure about reduced drag- this &quot;vacuum&quot; increases drag,
wheras if or rear were exteded into a teardrop shap, drag would be
decreased- I'm a bike rider and this is well know in Human Powered Vehicle designs.
   Now let's move on- what does Craig have to say about leaving off the
plates under the cylinders/heads that block the direct flow downwards of
cooling air and direct it to the rear?  Are these there to help cooling or
just protect the pushrod tubes?   I have a feeling it causes &quot;stagnant&quot; air
to cyl. # 1 and 3, making them hotter?
