Subject: Re: [T2] Bus man is also a Bee Man!

Hey Guys   I told that girl she had better have an ugly filter on that camera 
if she expected it to turn out  she must of had one  LOL    yes I will have 
some honey at High Country this year  I havent been a bee nut quite as long as 
a bus nut  took a year of study at Va. tech my senior year in 1985 and have 
been keeping them ever since.  getting bees out from inside a tree is not easy 
but I think it worked will know in a couple of days  . Back to buses still
