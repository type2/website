Subject: Re: Exhaust air leaks...?

I recently needed to replace the left exhaust manifold and heat
exchanger for my '81 Vanagon; dealer said &quot;Sorry Charlie, no longer
being made&quot; (God, I HATE VW of America) so I'd bet you would get
the same story.

Found the maifold at a local FLAPS for $250 - so I went to the junk
yards.  Snagged the manifold for $45, still looking for a heat
exchanger.

&gt; First, some info:
&gt;   My bus is a '77 fi.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Fourth, a question:
&gt;   Has anyone else priced exhaust components recently?  The price seems to 
&gt; vary hugely.  I think I'll probably end up going with a muffler from JC 
&gt; Whitney (woe is me) that replaces the cross-over and a few other 
&gt; pieces...  I haven't seen any exhaust manifolds for sale anywhere - junk 
&gt; yard!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance!
