Subject: VIN Clarify ... was westy vs. campmobile

&gt;The first digit means it's a VW Type 2 (Bus)
&gt;The second digit is what kind of Bus.  All the regular Buses that I've
&gt;seen had a 2 for that second digit.  The bodies that Westfalia did the
&gt;conversions on have a 3 there.  I forget what type of body that was &gt;but 
&gt;I'm sure someone can give us the breakdown.  The trucks would have &gt;had yet 
&gt;a different number there.
&gt;The third digit is the last digit of the model year, 6 = '76.
&gt;Could also be '66 but you'd know the difference :-)


Hi Folks,

Just to clarify the VIN that Sean mentioned.  If the number is a 9-digit 
number (236-xxx-xxx), then the 3rd number is the last number of the year -- 
Nineteen-sixty-six in this case.  If the VIN is a 10-digit number 
(2362-xxx-xxx), the 3rd number is also the last number of the year, but the 
4th number indicates it's the 2nd decade of this numbering system -- 
Nineteen-SEVENTY-six in this case.

Also, the 3 in the second place indicates a Kombi, which was the base 
&quot;incomplete vehicle&quot; that Westfalia-werke used for their conversions.

Just a few things I've noticed...

Aspen, Colorado
1979 Westy &quot;Sweet Pea&quot;  &lt;-- 2392 056 372, Campmobile with poptop
