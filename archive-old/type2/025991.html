&gt; Any fair race under these circumstances has to include a rebuild in
&gt; parking lot of an Oklahoma City Wal-Mart. Single-handed. In late July. I
&gt; don't think the Type IV crowd will be so smug in a situation like
&gt; that. =^ )
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway the gentleman said his friend could get a free Type I engine to
&gt; go in the engineless 74, so the economics are different than you're all
&gt; proposing. The tinware is not that big a deal, it is available from Just
&gt; Kampers, and I can't believe the moustache bar is that big a deal.

Or maybe the type 4 guys can keep the cooler stocked while the type 1 guys
are rebuilding the engine:)

Ken, I hate to admit it, but years ago, before type 4 engines were easy to
come by cheap, I did convert a '75 bus that was given to me without and
engine, to a 1776 type 1 engine because I had it just laying around.  The
time it took for the conversion was 3 times longer than I thought it would
be and at least twice as expensive.  With the cost of good used type 4
engines, you will still be time and money ahead even with a free type 1.
BTW, my type 1 conversion looks stock, most people think it is, but I would
NEVER DO IT AGAIN!!!!
