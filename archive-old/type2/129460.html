Subject: Re: [T2] Speedo Adjust or calibrate?

Try a GPS.  Seems like everyone's got one these days and they are quite
accurate.  I know my bus get progressively more off as I go faster.
Luckily, it says I'm going faster than I really am!

And I thought I was really going 80.. haha

&gt; I then pulled the speedo cable out of the wheel and connected it to
&gt; my variable speed drill...it is one that has the small dial in the

&gt; drill to rotate backwards(same direction as the tire turns).  Repeat
&gt; for faster speeds.  The stock tires on my bus are listed at 833 
&gt; revolutions per mile.
