Hiya All,

This question is about time......................

I'm looking at adjusting my Baywindow clock (a gray face) and on the back of 
the clock there is a set screw.  OK so far.  But above the set screw is a 
horizontal double headed arrow.  And above the arrow there is a + to the left and 
a - to the right.  

My clock is running slow.  My first impulse would be to turn the set screw in 
a clockwise manner (in other words toward the -) to speed it up.  But that - 
thing is giving me second thoughts.  Any advice out there on which way to turn 
the set screw to speed up the clock?

And does anybody know what the notched increments around the set screw are 
supposed to indicate (if anything?)

Thanks!

Mike
