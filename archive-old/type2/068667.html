So H Steven Dolan says:

&gt; Placing his tongue gently, but firmly within his cheek, Steve Dolan saith:
&gt; 
&gt; As I think of it, a bicycle is a *way* cooler idea than a non-pop-top
&gt; Westy. As a matter of fact, thinking further, it is almost as cool as my
&gt; dream car, a diesel transplanted into a Syncho Westfalia. Just think, a
&gt; car qualified to drag race with Thom Fitzpatrick, but 30 years younger:-)!

Mr. Dolan,

When you say you'd like this vehicle to drag race with Thom F., are you
saying you want to:

        A) Race with Thom and his Barndoor project (no engine)?
        B) Race with Thom in his '56 daily driver?
        C) Race with Thom in his Porsche which he sold?
        D) Race this new van with Thom while he runs along side?

        or 

        E) Drag Thom behind with a rope tied to his ankle?

        :)  ;p   ;)  :)
