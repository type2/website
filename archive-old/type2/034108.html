Gentlepersons-
                       Those of you with access to Sunday's NY Times (check 
your local library), in the San Francisco area, check out the National 
Report, pg. 33. Ms. Kath-
leen Gray and her boyfriend, David Aquino, are living in her '78 VW pop-top. 
Not, I
might add, by choice.
                      The van is not running (probably not the least of Ms. 
Gray's problems),
but one that this list could help...I'm willing to send $25 to anyone willing 
to help her
at least get her van running (maybe just a tune-up, points and plugs, what 
could it 
cost?)
                      The writer from the Times is Evelyn Nieves. Perhaps she 
knows where
Ms. Gray is parked? If you think this may be your cup of tea, contact me 
direct.
