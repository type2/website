&lt;&lt; &gt; A small door panel puller makes a handy tool for popping the valve cover

Anybody have more tips?

Yup, get a spring puller at a motorcycle shop, looks like a little 'J' hook 
with a handle on the end. Lets you pull all kinds of things without swearing 
or using your needle nose pliers
