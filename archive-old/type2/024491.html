I have a set of 16 inch wheels off a mercedes that fit perfectly on the wasser boxer bus 84-87 I think, but the studs on my 76 are to short for the wheels to be lug bolted on securely.  Now what are people doing to correct this problem??   Any help is greatly appreciated,, also I hear the new Audi's are coming with wheels that also bolt on to the buses and news on this one...??
