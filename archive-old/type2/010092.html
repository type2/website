Yesterday, as I said in another post, I picked up a child's cot at a 
junkyard for $10. I brought it home and washed the canvas. I will install 
the clips on the pillars of my bus and use the cot for storage when I 
camp.

My son won't fit in the child's cot. He's six-foot-two and growing. I 
didn't have a bus, camperized or otherwise, when he would have fit the 
cot. I hadn't figured it out yet. But he would have loved the idea of the 
cot.

When he was little, he had a little chuckle that let us know he was 
pleased. We called it &quot;the chuckle of approval.&quot;

Everything about a VW camper would have made him chuckle.

I write this in reaction to Tobin Copley's message, but I don't address 
it to Tobin. Fair is fair, and financial pressures are financial 
pressures. He did what he had to do.

No, this is to the rest of you who have a Westy or just a bus, and who 
have little kids. 

You have the chance of a lifetime! Please, don't waste it. Bundle up the 
kids and the SO and put them in your bus and head out. Use your bus every 
chance you get, and steal a chance or too to boot.

In no time at all, the kids will be six-foot-two.
