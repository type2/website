&gt; In that pic, the area of the heat exchanger attaches to the fan
&gt; shroud. So the cooling fan pushes air into the HEs as well?
&gt; 
&gt; I blocked off those openings in the fan shroud, and just want to make
&gt; sure there's no problem with that since the HEs are gone now.


Don,

You should leave those opening open if you remove the heat exchangers. This
seems counter-intuitive, but I remember a thread on shoptalkforums recently
and jake raby has proven on his dyno that engine cooling suffers if the
openings are blocked. Blocking the openings creates turbulence inside the
fan shroud and the airflow to the engine is reduced.
