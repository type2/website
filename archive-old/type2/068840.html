Hi, Jeff-- Somebody else mentioned this too [Joel?  Sorry, whoever,], but
I'm not sure I get it.  I'm sitting here running simulations with a slice
of my breakfast toast [&quot;okay, this end with the jelly hanging over is the
rear end of the bus, and this glass of orange juice is my direction of
travel . . . &quot;] and I can't figure out why it would be different. 

So why is it a different problem if the front breaks traction first rather
than the rear? [With a rear engine drive, wouldn't this be the usual way
it would happen?] And what *do* you do if the front end comes around? 
[Yeah, yeah, I know:  &quot;Bend over and . . . &quot;  Besides that, I mean.]
