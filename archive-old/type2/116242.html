Terry...

Thanks for the advice.  WeatherPop tells me &quot;Tue - Fair&quot;, so hopefully 
I'll be able to seal it up in a couple of days (last year's bathroom 
repairs lead me to believe that I'll have better luck if I wait for the 
rain to stop and the surface to dry a little :-)

&gt; Either the glass is short-or the metal behind it is going away--
&gt; I think the glass could be short--

I'm pretty sure the metal is OK.  I don't see any rust when I look down 
at the sagging area (though I can see some at the bottom of the 
windshield, but this is hardly unusual for s Bus, and it appears to be 
minor).

I'll snap a photo of it tomorrow and post it.

Thanks again!
