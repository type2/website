&gt; [Background Info]
&gt; I recently replaced the dual carbs et al on my 1972, 1700, with a single Weber
&gt; carb conversion kit from CIP1. The new carb works very well and it has
&gt; improved my fuel economy, and power greatly.

Ok, improved power.  This might be increasing blow-by of the piston rings
due to increased chamber pressure.

&gt; However, immediately after the carb swap, the engine started spitting out oil.
&gt; It appears as though the engine oil is sloshing (or being pushed) up the
&gt; filler tube and running out from where the plastic part is clamped to the
&gt; metal tube -- strange because oil doesn't leak out of there when the crank
&gt; case is being filled...?

Oil vapor will go places that the liquid oil would never find, such as
uphill or through tiny holes.

I don't know about your hose routing, but your problem might be with your
improved power.
