Subject: Re: [T2] re: tranny mount sealing rings

It was probably designed (ie: over-engineered) that way. Speculation on my
part, but the bushings could have been used to dampen vibration. The seals
(perhaps o-rings) were probably there to prevent the ends of the bushings
from being crushed/cracked on the ends when torqued. With the advent of the
different design on 73-later models, this point perhaps became moot (and
they were probably cheeper to produce this way).

&gt; Ever since I discoevered these little things, I have been scratching my
&gt; head as to why the nylon sleeve and bushing are there in the first place.
&gt; The only possible answer I can muster is that the rings/bushings were meant
&gt; to keep the steel fasteners from contact with the dissimilar metal of the
&gt; trans? Or did VW goof and end up with oversized holes in the bellhousing,
&gt; necessitating the use of of the sleeves?
