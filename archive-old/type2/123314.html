Subject: Re: [T2] Differnt Speedometer question

Ted,

The correct tires????&lt;grin&gt;

Tell us about your tires!  VW speedo's run directly off of tire
rotation speed.  Larger or smaller tires will cause problems.

Stockish bus tires are supposed to be about 25.7&quot; in diameter
and get approx 808 revolutions per mile.

Go pick your tires out on www.tirerack_dot_com, and then choose to look at 
&quot;Spec's&quot;.  


Cheers, dave

&gt; I have an issue with my speedometer where it shows the miles per hour speed
&gt; roughly 5 to 10 miles faster than it should.  I've replaced the speedometer
&gt; with one that I know was accurate in my last bus, but I still have the
&gt; issue.  What should I start looking at to get this problem corrected?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
