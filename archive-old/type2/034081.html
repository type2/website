&gt; So now,  My pop top is flying up on windy days.

&gt; What have you all done with your poptops?

I have noticed that up-to 72 pop tops use tubular front hinges. Almost all I
see at the wrecking yards are bent, broken, or the pivot bolts have broken
and been replaced. I found 73 uses flat stock hinges like the later rear
hinge pop tops. These have not been bent or broken.

Does anyone out there have a 73 with flat stock hinges and does NOT have a
problem with the front lifting up?

I am wondering if VW changed to this style because of the tube hinge
problem?

If this is a fix....I have one pair of 73 flat stock hinges...
[I am brain-dead this morning....73 was the last year of front hinged pop
tops, correct? 74 was the 1st year of rear hinge?]
