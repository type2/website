Subject: Re: [T2] Camper Prices going UP!

These are the vans I've seen or will be seeing this afternoon:

Westfalia, 1980, but without the propane set-up, has an
icebox. Owned by a VW mechanic for years. Priced at $4,100, and it's
orange.

1986 Westfalia, champagne, $9,000. I guess it
 it has the newer engine.

 ...and a 1985 for $7,000, white, with the &quot;straight-up&quot; poptop?

...and a 1981, orange, automatic, looks great, has no records. It's a
used car dealership....priced neg.  at about $5,000
