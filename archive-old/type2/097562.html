IMO, the first thing you should do is to buy an Idiot's Guide by John Muir.
Next, a Bentley manual.  Between the Muir book's super user-friendly
instructions and drawings, and the Bentley tech precision and
comprehensiveness, you should be pretty set.  Then, refer to the
www.type2_dot_com archives, and this list for any extra help needed.
Now, about the dizzy:  are you sure it's not in fact already attached by the
very low-profile flat piece of metal at the base mentioned by
&quot;Faster-Laster&quot;?
If it &quot;runs beautiful&quot; you'd think the thing is set up already, but maybe
not.  Can you rotate or lift out the dizzy? If not, perhaps you just aren't
familiar with the minimalist VW clamp?  If so, is the clamp attached to the
dizzy?  If clamp is there, bolt it back down, time the motor (welcome to VW
ownership,and good luck!) and tighten it up.  If not, get a new clamp and do
the
above.  Why the clamp would be absent is beyond me, though.  Good luck!

&gt; Does anyone know how to secure the distributor down? I got the motor from
a wreck yard (it  runs beautiful) and have never worked on a VW air cooled
motor (Yes, I'm a REAL newbie).  Right now the distributor is just &quot;sitting&quot;
there.  Seems dangerous so I haven't driven the unit yet.
