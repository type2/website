Subject: Recommended Compression Ratio for today's fuels?

Hi All:

I am looking for opinions on compression ratios for today's fuels that
minimize heat build up on my heads. I will be running a stock type IV
2.0L engine (hydraulic cam, valves, etc.), fuel injected, 87 octane
fuel, as a daily driver pushing around a 5000 lb Vanagon Westy.

From the &quot;Re: [T2] Head failure_at_ 15K Miles -today's fuel question&quot; I
gather that today's fuels run leaner and hotter than what my 20 year old
engine was designed around. I am looking for a CR recommendation that
will keep my cylinder heads temps down, allow long life (more important
than power) etc. Any suggestions? I remember reading in a past thread
that the Mexican engines were running 7.75:1. Is that something to shoot
for?

Regards,
