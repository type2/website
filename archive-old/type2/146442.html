Subject: RE: VW is to Mercedes, as hard is to find..

&gt;There are three paths you can take:
&gt;1. Wash the wheels more frequently.
&gt;2. Install dust shields and overheat the brakes.
&gt;3. Switch to a harder brake pad and replace your brake
&gt;rotors more often than necessary.
&gt;4. Paint your wheels black (like the cop cars).

The consensus is that these shields overheat the brekes and that's
not good.

since I don't really want black wheels, it seems that ill have to
relegate myself to more frequent baths.

Thanks to everyone for the information and recommendations.

David.
