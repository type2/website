The Bus Despot (sorry Ron...&lt;grin&gt;) sez:
&gt;**DO NOT** use stock American fuel line. 

and he sure is right...However...
there *is* correct &quot;american&quot; HP fuel line available....
you have to *ask* for  the FI line and get the special FI clamps for it...the
outside is bigger and too soft to use the regular clamps........
Sooooo if your stuck in YeeHaa Junction  and you're spraying fuel all
about...you *can* get  a replacement line...
and this is not a plug for anyone..but the german stuff fits well and looks
better..same clamps..fits throught the same grommets etc.....
don't panic that there is no braiding on the outside the US stuff is a multi-
cord weave on the *inside* it's marked &quot;HP&quot; and &quot;FI&quot;...and it's
costly....Repairs? US FI stuff.will be fine...replace the whole
shemallie?..buy a roll of the german.....
