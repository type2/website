Subject: Fwd: Name that mechanical failure #2

I got a lot of good suggestions for this one, but nobody guessed the exact 
problem.  I first found that the wire going from the condensor to the coil 
was frayed at the condensor.  I replaced the condensor and points with 
spares (brand new Wells parts) and the bus wouldn't start.  No spark.  I 
then proceded to curse the infidel American parts while digging out my 
soldering iron.  Found the soldering iron but no solder.  Guess I packed 
just a bit too fast.  In the end I just stripped some wire from the end of 
the Bosch condensor and twisted the coil wire around it.  Reinstalled the 
Bosch condensor and points.  When I was putting the cap back on, I checked 
out the contacts inside for corrosion and noticed that the button in the 
center was missing.  Then I looked at the rotor and the tab in the middle 
was also missing - broken off.  How this happened I will never know, but 
there was clear evidence (burn marks) that the spark had been arcing from 
the spring up in the center of the cap down to the jagged edge of the metal 
strip left on the rotor for some time.  I can't believe it ever ran this 
way, but it did!  I put on the spare cap and rotor and the bus roared to 
life again.  Guessed the dwell, set the timing and we were on our way back 
to Texas.

Thanks for the replies,

&gt;Installment #2, Here is the second failure:
&gt;
&gt;Driving North into Wisconsin, the engine started to surge and buck a 
&gt;little.  I pulled over and found that it would idle at a normal rpm, but 
&gt;with very slight misfire/popping noises.  While driving, it was most 
&gt;noticeable at very low and very high rpm.  At very low rpm (say, below 
&gt;1500) if I stepped on the gas in gear it would buck violently.  At very 
&gt;high rpm (above 4500) the tach needle would shoot up way high and dance 
&gt;around.  At freeway cruise though, the problem varied from not at all 
&gt;noticeable to barely noticeable.  Since we were relatively close to our 
&gt;destination (with a driveway, shade, and a shower) and the problem was not 
&gt;too bad, I decided to push on.  We made it to Sister Bay, WI and parked 
&gt;the bus.  The next morning I started it and drove around the block a few 
&gt;times.  When the engine was cold, the bucking/surging was so bad that I 
&gt;could barely drive it, but as the bus warmed up the symptoms would get 
&gt;weaker and weaker until, when fully warmed up I could again barely notice 
&gt;anything was wrong, just a light, occasional surging.  At idle, the 
&gt;symptoms never changed - cold or hot, it idled normally with just a hint 
&gt;of misfire/popping.
&gt;
&gt;Gas was 87 octane Wisconsin regular
&gt;Weather was warm (85 degrees) and humid
&gt;Dellorto DRLA 40 dual carburators with freshly oiled filters
&gt;Two inline fuel filters, the little plastic ones
&gt;Holley adjustable fuel pressure regulator set to 1psi
&gt;Newer Brazilian mechanical fuel pump from Bus Depot (maybe 2 yrs old)
&gt;Never have had a problem with rust or other fuel contaminate in the past.
&gt;New Bosch plug wires
&gt;Bosch platinum plugs
&gt;Stock points ignition
&gt;Stock dizzy with retard disconnected, set to 8 degrees BTDC
&gt;Dwell unknown (had adjusted points trying to fix failure #1 and didn't 
&gt;bring my meter)
&gt;15W50 Mobil 1 synthetic oil running at about 220 degrees
&gt;Battery voltage okay
&gt;Hydraulic lifters
&gt;No ECU, it's a '73 bus
&gt;
&gt;Please send questions/guesses to me directly, NOT to the LIST :-) and I 
&gt;will post a summary later today.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
