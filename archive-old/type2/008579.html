Subject: Type I vs. Type IV motors
To: type2 mailinglist &lt;type2_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Hey All,

Ok...this smells like a FART (you remember,
&quot;Frequently-Annoyingly-Recurring-Thread&quot;) in the making, but I have to
give my own opinion here. 

First, let's review the rules:
1- Keep your gloves on at all times.
2- The use of teeth is expressly forbidden (unless you're Mike Tyson).
3- No hitting below the belt (ESPECIALLY if you are Mike Tyson!!!).
4- Let's make this a fair fight.

Ok, now that we've all been properly Mirandized...


I think the subject of putting a Type I motor in a later loaf is
something we're all going to be seeing a LOT more of in the coming
years.

Why? The answer is obvious. The Type I is still being made, while the
Type IV is not. True, you can rebuild both, though the Type IV is
pretty pricey (hell, a new carb is pricey to me!!!). BUT....you can
only rebuild a case so many times. Also, a NEW Type I motor
(Beetlemex) can be had for less than a rebuild.

Now, I'm not saying that rebuildable Type IV cases will become extinct
in any of our lifetimes, as that is in all likelyhood not true.
However, as time goes on, they will continue to get more expensive,
just as they become more &quot;rare&quot;. 

Also, we ALL have to acknowledge that since there are about 100 (ok,
maybe a thousand) times as many Type I engines in existance, there are
also more suppliers of parts. More suppliers=more parts...more
parts=lower prices...lower prices=more buyers and the cycle repeats
itself, get it?

So...it becomes a matter of dollars and sense (yes, I meant SENSE!)
for some people to convert.


I do NOT want to be a part of a Type I vs. Type IV conspiracy. Both
motors have their merits. Both have their detractors. You got yours, I
got mine. To each his own. 

We all own busses, right? I think the BUS creates the bond, not the
motor.

Go pick on somebody your own cc ;-)



Jaime
