I found a very nice straight body, good paint, whole interiored 77 Westy
last night for $2300.00 !!  BUT the automatic transmission is shot.  The
owner has an extra 2.0L in the garage that goes with it also.

My question, can anyone give me some pros /  cons on automatic
transmissions ?  I WANT this bus.
