Subject: Hunting Island siting

I was responding to a medical call at the campground at Hunting Island State 
park when we passed a tan Westie heading into town from the Hunting Is 
direction.  Two guys driving, seemed a little mystified as to why a guy in a 
firetruck with all the lights on was giving them a peace sign.  A couple of 
hours later on my way in the other direction passed them again, this time 
they were ready for me and waved as they passed.
