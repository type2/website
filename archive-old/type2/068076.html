Subject: Split bus headlight rims

Hi everyone,

Slough VW swapmeet today.
I found something I've been after for a while -- a pair of NOS
chromed split bus headlight surrounds. Great price. But now
that I'm home with them I notice the adjusting screws are in
different positions from the ones on my bus. My new ones
(they're Bosch) have screws at 6 o'clock and 9 o'clock. My
old ones have screws at 4 o'clock &amp; 10 o'clock.

Will the new ones fit? Why are they different? Is it a Bosch
vs. Hella thing?

Sarah
