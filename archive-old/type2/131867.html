Subject: Re: [T2] Getting to brake reservior, 84 Vanagon

I have an 80. If you look through the windshield at the cover over the
instruments you should see indents at both ends of the cover. These are so you
can grip the cover and lift up on the front of the cover to remove it. Once
removed you should see the reservoir behind the instruments.

  And so it is. I'll be darned. So when the manual sez, &quot;under the
  cluster,&quot; they must-a been kidding.

  Thanks!
