Subject: Re EMPI Bus--
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL - S

As some of you know Magoo and i have been doing this VW Stuff thing going on our 3rd
decade--
On May 7th i will be having my right hip replaced--so it will be a while before &quot;I'm back
on the Glory Road&quot; --with &quot;Bessie&quot; or the 63 23  &quot;Sam&quot;--or Herbie--and another VW truck in
the works!--A Lot of interest has been shown on this EMPI Bus--IF my supplier comes thru
-- i intend to sell them for what they cost us!!! That is my hope!!
That means a VWonderfull savings to you bus collectors--Already someone aked for 20!--I
really just want to help the collector on this --not a seller--But we will try--We are
talking about a Lot of EMPI buses right now--without a specfic date to hit the
market--hopefully Das Klassic--This will be my way of saying thanks to all of our
friends!! Kind of a going away gift for all of you--But--That is only if i can get the
amount i want to help all of you--We will keep you informed--Have a Vantastic and
VWonderfull day--TWWM, uj
