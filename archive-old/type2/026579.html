&gt;Does any one know if a porche transaxle will fit a 1976 VW van?

They can be made to fit if you don't mind some parts fabrications and
cutting and welding on your bus.  The basics are that you have to weld
in some front mounts, use type III CV's for the inners, cut/weld your
shift bar, and use a 914 clutch (and maybe flywheel too).  I've never
seen one in person, but I've heard of them and I've got an article that
I found on the Vanagon list a few years ago about what you have to do.

If you use a 901 from a 914, you'll have to take it apart and flip the
do-hickey (technical term) otherwise you'll have a bus with 5 backward
gears and 1 forward.  If you use one from a 911, you're OK as is.
