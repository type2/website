Hey all,
I have an extremely urgent question. Can anybody please tell me the distance in inches between the INSIDES of the front tires on a 66 bus.  I am picking up my new 66 tomorrow with a tow dolly (6 hour drive) and it just occurred to me&quot;What if it doesn't fit on the dolly?? GULP!_at_!!  If it doesn't fit I would be SCREWED with another 6 hour drive home and no bus to show for my troubles.
Thank You ALL, Peace, John Baker
