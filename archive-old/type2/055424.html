Some comments made in another thread about limiting the top end speed
make me wonder what's really safe for my '76 Westfalia. Mine is the 2L
fuel injected type 4 engine. It's a recent rebuild by yours truly, an
experience I don't soon wish to repeat.

I've owned earlier busses ('63 &amp; '67) which I would (could) never take
above 60 mph. This bus with the type 4 seems quite happy cruising at
65-75 mph. What is the recommended top speed? I do not have a tach.

I appreciate everyone's input. I don't want my Westfalia to become a
&quot;Westfailure&quot;.

Thanks,
Will
