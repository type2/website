Subject: Gerbil engine replacement, part VIII

When I swapped out the engine on the Gerbil (1966 Kombi/camper), I
also installed a 12 volt rebuilt starter.  This was because the new
engine came with the larger flywheel, and I didn't want to deal with
changing flywheels.  The bus had already been converted to 12 volt,
but I've been using the smaller flywheel and a 6 volt starter, because
it *always* started (something about spinning a lot faster with all
those volts running around).

Anyway, I began having starter problems within a day or two of getting
everything together.  I figured it was a combination of an improperly-
rebuilt starter and/or my neglecting to do anything about the bushing
that the starter shaft fits into in the transmission housing.  This
weekend, my plan was to see if the starter was hanging up on anything
or in any other way looking like an installation problem.  Given the
general concensus of the list, I also resolved to at least try putting
in a booster relay before declaring the starter itself junk.  Also,
in my last update, I reported:

:  Still running hot, so I need to play with the timing soon.
:  Realistically, it's probably the carb, but I understand how to deal
:  with timing much more, so I want to exhaust that avenue first.

Since then, there've been several diatribes against the 009
distributor which I have.  Some of them had enough factual content in
them to believe that my heat problem might be related to that.  So, I
also planned on swapping out distributors.  Just in case, I also
picked up a rebuild kit and an additional 34pict3 carburetor.  The
theory there is that the one that's on there may or may not be
rebuildable, and I'll eventually need another one for the engine I
took my current one off of anyway.

And so we proceed from the plan to the execution (fortunately, in this
case that word only applies as a figure of speech).

Disconnected the ground and pulled the engine.  As with all things,
practice is improving my time.  I used to be able (ten years ago) to
do it in half an hour.  These days, Saturday's hour and a half is
pretty good.  I was definitely appreciative of having run the fuel
line through the bulkhead last time -- no gas shower, for the first
time.

Took a look at the starter, and there's nothing blatantly obviously
wrong.  Played around a bit with the mounting studs and such, and
determined that the play in the shaft was more than any misalignment I
could get by tightening the mounts down unevenly, and so eliminated
that theory.  Noticed that there wasn't much sign of the teeth being
ground up, so alignment's probably not the problem at all.  Hmmm.
Maybe it *is* the 30 feet of wire to the front and back.

Some previous owner had installed a booster relay for the starter a
long time ago.  It appears to have been a headlight relay, as it is a
Hella.  It mounts into a hole in the frame that I'm pretty sure was
there from the factory, and in general, looks like it belongs there.
Unfortunately, it was a six volt relay, and thus not of direct use to
me.  I also noticed that the guy who'd converted the bus from 6 volt
to 12 volt for me (who I've already had reason to curse for his lack
of ability with things electrical), instead of replacing the relay
or even asking me about it, had simply cut the wires going to/from it,
and spliced things back the way they came from the factory.  The only
thing I can say in his favour is that the splices were done by
attaching slide-on connectors and wrapping the connections in
electrical tape.

In the mean-time, a friend's shown up to do a bit of bodywork while
I'm playing around with the starter.  Armed with wirebrush and rust
convertor (the cheap stuff that's locally available, not POR-15), he's
been happily turning my brown-and-white bumper grey, as well as
various other bits of the front end in the hopes of slowing down
the rust that's developing.  Sunday is the company picnic, and the
idea is to attend with a whole bunch of different paints and brushes,
and do a group-painting thing.  There's major body work in the future,
but it's not something I can deal with right now.

By now, I've developed a shopping list of things I need to pick up
before much more progress can be made:

- - 18 gauge green and black wire, to extend the wires that over the
  years have broken and had new connectors put on, to the point where
  they barely reach what they are supposed to connect to (oil pressure
  sending unit, coil, etc)
- - 10 gauge red wire, for the run between the battery, booster relay,
  and the starter
- - booster relay
- - slip on connectors
- - ring connectors, because I'll be getting power for the solenoid from
  where the battery connects to the starter, and that's a post, not a
  slide-on.  besides, the right-hand connector to the alternator broke
  off, and it's a post-style connection as well.
- - electrical tape
- - more rust converter, as the first can played out pretty quick;
  this was due to it being used previously on another vehicle.

So off we went to get parts.  There was a bit of an amusing
conversation at the generic FLAPS, as I asked for a generic 12 volt
headlight relay, and they insisted that all knowledge comes from their
computer, and they had to have specifics before they could look
anything up.  Finally, one of the other people there overheard us, and
suggested that all I needed was an after-market fog light relay (made
by ``Baja'', in this case).  I agreed that that would probably work
fine, and we wandered off relatively happy.  Had also picked up some
butt splice connectors, since they are self-insulating, and that would
be better than doing a slip-on splice with electrical tape.

Get back.  Friend goes back to killing rust and insects (the fumes
from the rust converter appears to be quite effective at the latter;
I'm quite convinced it's where my heavy-duty headache came from).  My
first task is to figure out where and how to mount the new relay.
There's no way to make it work with the mounting that the PO's relay
had used, as that relay had had metal clips that fit inside a round
hole, and the new relay is plastic with a hole for a screw.  There's
only the one hole in the frame member, so putting a bolt in would have
been difficult at best.  Looking around, I see that the voltage
regulator has two mounting screws that go straight to the frame.  It's
a small, light relay, so I figured that making one of those screws
would be the way to go.

All the relay's terminals point in the same direction, from the same
side of the case.  Also, the screw hole is at ninety degrees from the
terminals' orientation.  So, I mounted the relay above the regulator,
with the terminals pointing straight up.  This gave the greatest
clearance between the terminals and anything else in the engine
compartment (my regulator is mounted on the right-side wheel well,
near its top).  Next was figuring out how to route the various bits of
power around.

We'd ended up grabbing assorted sizes of splices and slip-on
connectors, since only a couple of each size (yellow for 10 gauge,
blue for eighteen) were needed.  The mistake was that I hadn't figured
out how many connectors I'd need before hand (particularly allowing
for mangling a few while getting the hang of crimping them on), and
thus, there weren't enough.  In this particular case, what I wanted to
do was take power for the starter from the bottom terminal of the
regulator, since there's already a heavy-duty wire between them, and
there's an extra slip-on terminal on the regulator.  However, I didn't
have enough slip-on to do that and take care of all the places I *had*
to have slip-ons, so instead I went with the original plan of a ring
connector on the post on the starter.  Ran the battery power from that
post to the relay, and the fabricated a wire to go from the relay to
the upper post on the starter.  Also fabricated an extension to the
cable that used to go to the starter, and ran it to the + side of the
relay.  Fabricated another wire that went from the - side of the relay
and ran it down to the other mounting screw for the regulator (using
another ring-style connector).  I used that one, instead of the one
that was holding the relay up, because it had a nice clean metal
surface under it.  Also, the upper one was already having to deal with
the extra thickness of the relay mount, and the screws are relatively
short.

Ok, everything looks pretty much right, so connect the ground, have my
helper watch the starter to make sure it extends properly and spins,
and go turn the key.  As soon as I hit `on', and was nowhere near
progressing to `start', the starter kicked in.  Even worse, it
wouldn't stop even after turning the key off.  Eep.  Run to the back,
figure that something's really confused, and attempt to pull the
wires.  The slip-ons are fairly happy where they are, but the act of
moving them must have broken the circuit for long enough for the
starter to decide to give up for the moment.  Sat back and thought for
a while.

Disconnected the wires going to the solenoid (so that there's no way
it could do anything), got out the meter, and had my helper turn the
key to various positions.  Turns out that when in the `on' position,
there was eight volts being provided to the starter.  When in the
`start' position, I was getting full battery voltage.  Hmmmm.  This
explains why the starter kicked in immediately -- eight volts is more
than enough to operate a small relay.  After some more poking around,
I come to the conclusion that the switch is partly shorted internally.
Well, maybe I can open it up, clean it out, and life will be good.

Disconnect the ground, and go look up the procedure for removing the
ignition switch (having seen all the horror stories on the list about
doing this, I wanted to make sure I knew what was involved before
going in).  The only book that mentioned it at all said (slightly
paraphrased) ``remove the retaining screw and lift out the switch''.
Looking under the steering column, first I have to figure out which
screw is the retaining screw, and then how/where the ``lift out''
maneuver is performed.  Ended up completely unbolting the retaining
bracket that goes around the steering column.  Turns out that the
retaining screw is the only one that you can see from underneath, so
that was pretty straight forward.  Spent quite a bit of time trying to
figure out how the switch comes out, to finally discover that it goes
straight back into the dash area, and can then be pulled out of either
side of the housing it was in.  *sigh* As the book says, all you have
to do is take out that one screw....

Once the switch was out where I could see it, I figured out where that
electrical burning odor had been coming from since I installed the new
engine.  Since there was a direct correlation in timing between those
events, I'd figured it was some coating burning off of the heater
boxes or some such.  Nope.  It was the connection for the wire to the
starter.  Crisp, bubbly electrical tape.  Bleah.  Note which wire goes
where, and disconnect everything.  After trying to disassemble it for
a bit, all I got for my trouble was a whole bunch of bakelite flakes.
The switch was quite probably the original switch, as usually that
substance doesn't flake like that (but after thirty years, most things
get pretty flaky).  Also determined that the housing was held on by
having been crimped on.  Without major special tools, there is no way
to disassemble one of these without also destroying the bakelite.

Helper's run out of rust convertor again (two cans, plus the half can
from before, and the bus isn't done yet; it's not even very grey yet).
I'd expect a normal-size spray can of something paint-like to be able
to cover my entire bus, not ten or fifteen percent.  Grump.  In any
case, he goes off to pick up another can (there's not that much more
to cover) and get a generic ignition switch.  There's not a VW-aware
FLAPS open at the moment, and I really want to get back on the road.
I figure on picking up a real switch sometime next week, and dealing
with installing it after that.

Since there's not much more that can be done electrically at the
moment, I move on to the distributor.  Pull the points out of the new
one, since I've got that new Compu-Fire unit in the 009.  Pull the 009
off.  Notice that there's not a shaft seal on the new one, so transfer
that.  Something looks a litte odd at this point.  The shaft that the
points pivot on is still in the new distributor.  The 009 doesn't have
this shaft, and the Compu-Fire module doesn't have a hole for it (in
fact, it's got a stud so it can anchor in where that post would be).
Try to remove the shaft, and get absolutely nowhere.  Maybe I can
figure out what, if anything, is wrong with the 009.  After a bit of
disassembly, I can see the counter-weights, the spring that they work
against, and all that.  It looks like the shaft that's inside the
distributor body is supposed to be able to move semi-independently of
the external shaft that is driven by the engine.  However, even with
plyers, I can only get about two degrees of relative motion.  This
would appear to explain some of my problems with the 009....

Given that the 009 can't do advance at all (sounds like a pretty flat
curve to me), I've got to get the replacement distributor to work.
Can't use the Compu-Fire, because there's no way to mount it with that
shaft in there.  Ok, go with points for now, and think about picking
up one of those CDI units like Herr Hoover has discussed.  I know I've
got a new set of points running around (pre-Compu-Fire), so I go track
them down.  They've got a brass pivot shaft already in them.  Hmmm.
Maybe that shaft can be removed.  Careful application of a fulcrum and
hammer does the trick, and it pops out.  The base plate of the points,
however, will not fit down over the pivot shaft in the distributor
though.  Grump.  Decide to use the points and condensor that came with
this distributor, even though they are definitely used.  Filed the
points as well as I could with a file that's definitely *not* suited
to that sort of thing, put it all together, and set the point gap.

Ok, it looks like it's probably a functional distributor now.  Mounted
it on the engine (had some trouble getting the shaft seal through the
mounting bracket) and set the timing statically to about 5 degrees
BTDC.  In process, noted that the oil leak I'd previously assumed to
be the oil pressure sending unit was actually coming from the crank
case stud underneath the intake manifold.  I'd had to completely
remove the bolt from that stud to get the intake manifold on (the stud
doesn't extend past the manifold's bracket).  It looks like what I
should plan on doing at some point is getting a longer stud to replace
the one that's there, and actually bolting it down.  Fortunately, it's
a pretty slow leak.

Since I've got the engine out, I decided to check the torque on the
lower head bolts.  I figured this was something that would just show
that they are indeed at the proper torque, but it wouldn't hurt as a
peace-of-mind thing.  Turns out they were noticeably below torque
(like, about three-quarters of a turn).  Discovering this, by the way,
necessitates removing the rocker arms.  I torqued them all to where
they should be, but wasn't up for the full cooling tin disassembly
required to check the upper studs.  Hopefully they can hold out for
another couple of weeks, by which time I should be able to do a full
engine retorquing.

Put the rocker arms back on and torqued them down (fourteen
foot-pounds hardly seems like enough).  On a whim, figured that the
valves might have gotten a little out of adjustment, since the heads
had just been moved in closer to the case.  Yup, all but one had
insufficient clearance.  I think this answers the question I had a
while ago about why the clearance keeps opening up, as well; the heads
are receeding from the case as various studs and such either loosen
themselves or stretch.

About half-way through the torquing session, my helper gets back with
the switch and such.  I had him start installing it while I finished
up what I was doing.  This involved replacing the stock slip-on
connectors with ring connectors, and making sure the right wire went
to the right place (for some reason, the generic switch wasn't
labelled with the perfectly-logical German terminal numbers).

Now that the switch was in and the engine about ready to be installed,
I had him operate the key while I watched what happened in the back
(after reconnecting ground and the wires to the starter).  Everything
worked as I'd expected it to during the previous test:  turning `on'
had no effect, `start' caused it to extend itself and spin, going back
to `on' had it go back to its quiescent state, and nothing happened at
`off'.  Good.  Looks like the switch was indeed the major problem.

Created an extension for the oil pressure sending unit, since it was
about to break off again and the wire was almost too short already.
Then, re-installed the engine.  This went pretty quickly (again,
recent practice helps).  Had some trouble with the bolt near the
clutch lever, as it's hard to see and harder to get to from beneath,
and it had gotten pushed back when the engine was seated in.  While
down there, had my helper play with the heater control cables a bit,
so that I could attach them in such a way that they could actually
open and close.  They're correctly positioned, but the cables have so
much resistance to moving that the springs in the heater boxes aren't
enough to close them on their own.  For now, I still have permanent
heat.  At least I know what the problem is, though.

Wired everything up, which required replacing the connector on the
field wire for the alternator.  I'd been under the impression that
this was a ring-style connector.  However, the top nut doesn't come
off, apparently by design.  Rather than make yet another trip to the
FLAPS, I cut a small wedge out of the ring to turn it into a spade
connector.  Crude, but it appears to be effective.

Connected the fuel line, re-installed the air cleaner and rear apron,
and then started it up so that it could warm and I could then set the
timing.  Took some cranking to get the air out of the fuel line, but
then it seemed to be happy.  Didn't really want to idle a whole lot,
though.  Nursed it for a bit, and it got happier as it warmed.  Then I
realized that the distributor was locked down pretty tight, and I
really didn't want to try to loosen it with the engine running.
Killed the engine, loosened things just enough that I could turn them
(proven by testing), and re-started.  Either it was less reluctant to
run now that it was somewhat warm, or my test turning got the timing a
little better, because it definitely started more easily.  Let it run
for five or ten minutes, until I was pretty sure that the choke was
completely open, and then started playing with the distributor.
Eventually got it to the point where it wouldn't whuffle at idle or at
speed, which seemed like a pretty good start.  On the test drive, it
did pretty well, but is lacking power at low RPMs (like, I had to
step on the clutch to let the engine speed increase enough to start
moving from a stop light).

Question:  is this lack of power a timing or carburetor issue?  If the
former, then is it due to too much advance or retard?

Oh yeah.  The company picnic/painting party.  Well, it started at 10am
today.  Here it is, 4:49pm, and I'm ready to go.  There's thunder and
lightning outside.  Somehow, I don't think it's worth trying to get
out there.  At least the Gerbil's been primer'd, though....
