&gt;     When I turn the key it goes &quot;click&quot; and then nothing. 
&gt;     There is a flat spot in the ignition switch (if it feels like starting, you
&gt; can turn the key too far and it won't.) 

It sounds like the electrical part of the ignition switch. The bay one
runs about $35 at FLAPS and can be changed without removing the cylinder
or steering column if you have the patience of a Zen master. I changed one
once in the dark in the parking lot at Ronald MacDonald. Hours of fun for
the whole family...

I don't know whether the split is different. It could also be faulty
contact at the starter or faulty ground strap. Get after those connections
with a wire brush. It could also be the starter.
