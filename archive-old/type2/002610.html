Hello everyone!!!

 Tomorrow is the start of the JRMBBC II at Turner Falls in Oklahoma. I'm
looking forward to seeing allot of buses there!!

To get there: From OKC and points north...I-35 South to exit 51, turn on to
US 77 South, go 1 1/2 miles, entrance on your right.

From Dallas and points south...Get on I-35 North to exit 47, turn on to US
77 North, go about 3 1/2 miles, entrance on the left.

The cost is $5 per person per day....make certain that you tell the at the
gate that you are with the Josh Rogers group to get the group discount.

See You There!!!!
