&gt; &gt; Thanks for the info, John - does that mean the carb (?fitting?
&gt; &gt; ?manifold vacuum?) doesn't supply enough vacuum - and therefore
&gt; &gt; not enough advance?
&gt; 
&gt; exactly; notice that the distributor biscuit (advance can) on 70' and
&gt; earlier models is BIGGER than the 71' and newer ones, because of a lower
&gt; vacuum signal from the carb.

Got it - and thanks to Karl (aufever) for digging into JIM's website 
and noting that the Q has way low total vac advance.  Karl 
suggests a Bug Autostick dizzy or just finding the proper vac unit.

So my cheap solution to the 009 situation evaporates.  &lt;sigh&gt;  
TANSTAAFL.  On the other hand, if my mech hadn't strongly 
suggested the 009, I'd be ignorantly futzing with a (different) wrong 
diz for my engine.  Feng shui.
