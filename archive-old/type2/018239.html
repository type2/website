&gt; I guess I'm to blame for the acronym (or maybe
&gt; &quot;netcronym&quot;;-) of FART... A couple of months ago, I
&gt; half-jokingly wrote to the list about some annoying
&gt; thread that kept popping up (geez, I think it *was*
&gt; oil, now that I think of it!) and proposed calling
&gt; these items F.A.R.T.(s) for
&gt; &quot;Frequently-Annoying-Recurring-Threads&quot;. Get it?
&gt;

Whups, Jamie, a quick search of the archives turned up references
http://vw.i405_dot_com/sm.asp?path=\type2_at_primenet\03\0171.txt
as far back as Jul 96.
Call me an old fart...
