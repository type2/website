&gt;I found that Jerry Jess has one that he's willing to part with, assuming the 
&gt;lendee gives it back to him. Also who/where's Richard Kimball?

I have something after a fashion that tows a '68-'71 as well, it mounts
rigidly to
the front of the bus in place of the bumper but tows well enough as long as
the
hitch on the tow vehicle is at the right height.  It does shove you around
a bit.
I towed the single cab with it over 400 miles though using a Subaru Legacy
wagon with no real problems.

It is in WV, anyone daring enough to use it can do so at any time, tows with
all 4 on the ground.  Anyone who would want it for a 1 way tow can have it for
$40.  It is not pretty.
