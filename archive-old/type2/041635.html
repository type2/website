&gt;Just to muddy things a little bit, dredging up some
high school electronics
knowledge, what about the Faraday effect? That is that

electrons travel on
the surface of the wire so stranded wire has less 
resistance then solid
wire. My point being that 3-4 piece of 16WG will have
more 
strands then
10AWG and then in theory lower resistance? Is this 
pertinent? 

If I recall correctly, this applies primarily to AC
current, and the higher the voltage the more noticable
the effect.


&gt;Otherwise you could just use some 10-2 Romex which is
far cheaper then 10AWG wire, has better insulation too
(but is a pain to run through an auto since it
doesn't flex very well). 

Romex doesn't have appropriate oil resistant
insulation, and solid wire doesn't stand up to
vibration as well as stranded wire.

And, getting back to the original question:
The cost of the proper wire isn't &gt;that&lt; much, is it? 
Isn't the value of the vehicle enough to justify a
couple of dollars for the proper size and type of
wire?
