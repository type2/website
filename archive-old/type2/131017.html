Subject: alternator directions

Hey guys-

If an alternator spins in either direction, it should create the same DC
current since it is creating AC that is running through a rectifier.
Correct?

Therefore, besides the fan in the pulley not being right, the alternator
itself should work just as well spinning either way?

Thanx
-ToM
P.S.  Sure wish all this rain would stop or all of southern NJ will be under
water soon and Ill get to find out if my van floats!
