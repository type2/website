try a higher octane gas and see if it goes away, that is one way to check
to see if it is really a &quot;predetonation&quot; problem.  if it does maybe you
will have to continue using it, as I have been told by some WAG is that as
carbon deposits build up on the top of the piston over years it can raise
the compression ratio enough to need a higher grade of gas.

of course this could be all wrong too, but a tank of gas is quick easy
check anyway
