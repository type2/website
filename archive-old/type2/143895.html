Subject: Re: [T2] I Smell Gas...  (old story, new thread)

I agree.  I needed to replace ALL rubber related to
the fuel filler neck and vent hoses.  Several were
rotted out and needed to be replaced.  My 78 had not
been taken very good care-of, and the engine vacuum
hoses were also in need of replacement.
    
I recommend you replace all the rubber components
related to your fuel tank and fuel system, including
the fuel rail lines.
    
Be careful with the fuel rail hoses.  VW Air cooled
engines have a high propensity to leak and burn,
destroying the vehicle.  Pay careful attention to hose
and clamp selection.  Refer to the T2 archives for
extensive data on this subject.
    
At time of purchase about 5 years ago, the frequent
gasoline smell was specifically from a rotted-out fuel
neck hose.  As evidence of this problem, look inside
the engine compartment, right side, above the main
battery, and see if you have fuel stains upper right
where the metal hose goes through the sheet metal.  
There are other potential leak sources as well.

&gt; Pull that firewall. There is a connection there
&gt; where mine had rotted away. Drivers side as I
&gt; recall. There is another connection above the right
&gt; top corner of the engine lid. Finally check the
&gt; filler neck and the filler neck hose (at the bottom
&gt; of the filler neck). All pieces were badly cracked
&gt; on my 78. I too had the same problem. 
&gt; 
&gt; Really you'd be better off to just replace
&gt; EVERYTHING that handles fuel and is made of rubber.
