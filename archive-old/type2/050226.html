Subject: [T2] Mooching for a SoCal Imports and Latest Rage catalogue

Hi folks, with Cales positive comments about the SoCal outfit, I was
wondering if anyone has their catalogue or Latest Rages that they'd pass
along , as they will not ship them to Canada. I would be more than happy to
pay for the shipping and handling. RMMW would be nice too. Gene Berg would
be considered unbelievable. :-)
Thanks,
Courtney
