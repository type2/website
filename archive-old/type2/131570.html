Subject: Tranny Questions

Well last night I was at it again. I really hope to finish this engine this 
week. I forgot to install the front tin(FIF) before put threw the engine in. 
It is in place now all screws fastened. Major PITA. I pulled the pan of the 
Autotranny and the filler tube. Guts looked great. Stop the leak for now I 
think. The pan was slightly bent. I was checking it with a straight edge. 
Afew precise wacks with a rubber mallot and it is more true now. I might be 
looking for one later. Replaced the screen and gaskets. All of that went 
smooth.

Questions:

1. Is there supposed to be a gasket or seal under the cover for the govenor? 
I pulled mine and nada. When I ordered my seal and gaskets from Bus Depot I 
was told there was not a listing for it. I can't seem to find a listing 
anywhere for one and nothing showing in the Bentley. But it doesn't show my 
year transmission either in the pics. Just curious.

2. Recomendations on Hypoid Oil for the Final drive would be greatly 
appreciated. GL4, GL5, Synthetic, Snake Oil, etc.

Tonight I plan on finishing the tins and the FI setup. I did notice some 
wiring issues last night that I might be posting about tomorrow though.

Must move really soon.
Engine is coming along.
Can't wait to drive her.
