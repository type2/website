Subject: Stauling Out

Hello,
      I own a 1977 Westfalia and now that it it
turning cold here in MD I have been stauling out quit
a bit.  This is my first winter with it having bought
it in April.  It's my daily driver and would hate to
take out a loan and buy another car (but keep my 77
still of course) and drive that in the winter.  I like
driving the bus too much.  It's what I learned to
drive in too.  It only stauls out when I'm at a stop
sign or something like that and then I try to go. 
It's embarassing and people don't really like it I
don't think.  I got a tune up and that helped a lot
and it does not staul out as much.  Also, my choke
fell apart and I got that fixed along with the tune
up.  Does anyone know what I could do and if anyone
else has this problem and has fixed it-what was it? 
Thanks a lot.  I really appreciate it.

Peace,
Tim
