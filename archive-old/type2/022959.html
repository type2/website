&gt;What's the temperature in Minneapolis right now. My '75 and I were living in
&gt;Georgia, and now we're in Maine it has the same symptom -- real hard to pull
&gt;away from a cold start. I think it's the transmission grease thickening up in
&gt;our cold weather. It's far, far worse when it's twenty below than twenty
&gt;above, but twenty above is still worse than fourty. Once the tranny has run a
&gt;hundred yards or so, the problem is gone.

&gt;I was wondering if I should put in a lighter weight of grease.

If you're packing your transaxle with grease, that's your problem.

Sorry, couldn't resist.  :)  I like all kinds of synthetic lubricants, and 
in this case I would recommend Valvoline synthetic 75W90 oil, which should 
be available at any FLAPS for about $7/quart.  Steep yes, but you will only 
have to pay it once and your tranny will thank you.
