Subject: Re:Towing with a bus

Why doesn't a VW bus (auto) have a transmission cooler?  Has anyone ever
fitted one to their bus?  Has anyone ever installed a transmission
temperature gauge?  Where is the best place for a sender?
It's very hilly here where I live and I've been thinking about towing a
lightweight trailer with my '78 camper this summer, but I kind of always
thought of the auto tranny as a weak point.  I'd hate to do anything to
hasten its demise, but the additional room for gear on a small trailer would
be great.

Hello Greg................There are vehicle factors and terrain factors, 
and climate/weather factors, and then there are driver factors, all 
requiring consideration.

In your case, the hilly part is a negative, as is the automatic tranny. 
Also the fact that you want to do it in the summer. Next question 
is......how long and how fast? Those are driver decisions.

Heat is the killer in towing situations. It kills automatic trannys that 
aren't designed to throw off the extra heat load. Even in short towing 
trips, sometimes the tranny fluid cooks, changes color, changes molecular 
structure, and then destroys tranny valves and discs as you use the vehicle 
after the towing event. Every time you overheat the fluid, it must be 
completely drained and replaced in order to avoid the eventual failure in 
non-towing use.

So, if you decide to tow, put a sender where you can monitor the tranny 
fluid temperature.

The gauge will allow you to pull over and stop when your tranny fluid 
approaches the danger line. And that can happen in 20 seconds on a hot day 
when you are pulling a hill and have to keep up with traffic.

The automatic is the weak point, as you say. I'd risk towing with a 
manual....I have one and have towed with it, and all that happens is the 
oil overheats and the engine gets shut down to cool off, or better yet 
parked to idle until it cools itself off.

If you tow with the automatic, consider using synthetic oil in the 
engine....Mobil One, with a high viscosity rating.  Look around at the 
stats on tranny fluids and pick the one that can stand up best to high 
temperatures without breaking down.

And keep that trailer weight and frontal area low. About 600 pounds, 10 
square feet frontal. Then keep your speed under 50 mph. Above 50, the air 
starts behaving more like a liquid and the amount of energy your engine 
must generate to overcome wind resistance goes way up, and all that energy 
is transmitted through the spinning discs and fluids in the tranny.  So, 
the fluid cooks.

Hopefully, the driver is aware of the cooking, and changes the tranny fluid 
before the fluid changes the tranny.

Personally, I'd avoid towing with an automatic on hot days in the hills.
