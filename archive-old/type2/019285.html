I saw one of these conversions at a local car show; the VW Classic
in Irvine, Calif.  It was a split-window bus with a 16mm film projector
mounted behind the driver seat (lhd) pointing to the rear.  The rear
hatch opened up and held an semi-opaque screen stretched from the raised
rear hatch to the top of the engine room door.  The projector shined on
the inside of the bus. The audience viewed the film from behind the
vehicle on the other side of the screen.  There was also an audio system
installed to deliver sound toward the rear of the vehicle.  I am sorry
that I didn't snap a photo of that vehicle.  It was in very nice
original
condition.  Other photos from that car show (1997?) on my www page.
