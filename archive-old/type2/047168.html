Subject: [T2]transmission nosecone boot

One more time,
    Looking for the rubber boot that keeps dirt, etc from getting into
the transmission nosecone, for a 70 transmission.  Anyone know where
they are available or made something to take its place?

My only lead was Just Kampers, and they don't have them.....

Help!!

Mahalo
