&gt; I agree with Anton on this. There is still a long climb from Kingman to

&gt; One thing about doing the 15/70 is that there's a stretch of more than
&gt; 100 miles in Utah with &quot;no services.&quot; Not even on and off ramps, except
&gt; for a private ranch somewhere along there. In practical terms, I don't
&gt; know how much difference this makes. But psychologically, in a bus,
&gt; it'll keep your knuckles white.

oh yeah one additional thing, not sure about the Southern route but there
were many miles of I-15/I-70 where my cell had &quot;No signal&quot;
