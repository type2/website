Subject: Re: troubleshooter for overheating (was: cooling system for 78 Westy)

I was looking at Sami's Newly Updated Overheating text, and I realized the 
PO removed the EGR filter, but probably did not disable the EGR valve.

This may be a real problem for me. How would i go about disabling the EGR 
valve?

&gt;From Sami's Overheating text...
Running lean: Adjust carbs or, if you have fuel injection, check for false 
air. False air is air that sneaks into the intake manifold without first 
passing through the air-flow meter; hence the computer underestimates the 
amount of fuel to be injected.  A possible source of false air is an EGR 
valve that was not disabled, say, after the EGR filter fell victim to rust 
perforations; other sources are old, leaky rubber boots at the air intake 
distributor, disconnected or cracked vacuum hoses, loose valve covers, etc.

&gt;Volks,
&gt;Motivated by the recent thread (and the low opportunity cost of post-lunch
&gt;slump), I decided to re-edit the &quot;overheating&quot; text I wrote a few years ago
&gt;and which can also be found in the library. The updated version is now at
&gt;http://www.simplecom_dot_net/dakhlia/bus-stuff/overheating.html
&gt;Feel free to point out errors or to add your own two cents. Thanks,
&gt;Sami
