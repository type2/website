Subject: Re: [T2] update: please help urgent

We overfilled a Type IV one time and the first time it got hot it threw oil 
all over the engine (all the gasket leaked once the oil got hot) and 
started smoking badly as much of the oil was being burned by the engine as 
it was circulated through the PCV valve. Also the greater crankcase 
pressure cased by an overworked PCV valve seemed to cause all the leaks and 
crankcase pressure.

We stopped, cooled it, refilled it and all was well.

Are you SURE that you didn't overheat this bugger? Run a compression test. 
Stay AWAY from a mechanic right now. If you can afford a mechanic then you 
can afford a few decent tools. Sears has a decent compression tester. Buy 
one with a universal adaptor that screws in the spark plug hole.

Disconnect the coil, remove all of the spark plugs, install the compression 
tester in #1 hole and spin the engine with the key until the tester needle 
quits climbing or a few seconds - whichever comes first (usually will top 
out in under 6-8 seconds). You might also disconnect the fuel pump so it 
doesn't fire the injectors OR unplug the computer.

Results should be about 120 psi with no variance of more than 10 psi.

I would also inspect the valve clearances and the condition of the 
pushrods. My Corvair engine that I am resurrecting had 12 bent pushrods! It 
wouldn't run or would run poorly with this condition.
