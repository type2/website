Subject: Brochures

Fellow bus lovers,

I have finally added a link to one of the dealer brochures I have to my
website. Its for the 73. Please take a moment to look at it and let me know
if you think the size is too big. I have cable modem so everything pulls up
fine for me. All opinions are welcome, however I can only change the size
not the quality/resolution.

 I am going to add about 5 more of the brochures I have collected and if you
have any scanned I would be glad to add them or link to your page. Hit the
Back link at the bottom of that page to see the manuals and supplements we
went over a few months ago.

Here is the first one:

Thanks for your time!!
