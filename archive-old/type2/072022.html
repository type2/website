hiya volks;

i am new here, and want to remind you all how great your posts are. i have
been taking some notes, and enjoyed lurking the list. plugging in during
the flaps flap was real good timing.

i'd like to ask a question about my 75 campmobile.

three years ago i purchased a new air flow meter. i had it installed by the
dealership in town. the reason it was purchased was that
bucking/lugging/lurching became out of hand, and power was so weak on the
very slightest of inclines. i had this problem while living in san
francisco. gandalf's in south city adjusted the meter as close as possible,
but when it got loopy, i went for the new meter in oregon.

very soon after, the car was put on the shelf while living in michigan
during my apprenticeship, and another year in santa cruz without the
camper. two months ago i brought it back to use. a full-on tune was
performed and found once the camper was out of town and above thirty mph -
within 20 minutes, the lugging reminder was there. it feels like when you
are walking someone is pulling your rear belt loop on your jeans every two
to three miles. power is very weak as it was before.

my hunch led me to wonder if iwas sold the right meter. turns out the meter
i was sold is 0 280 200 018.  but the number specified for my year
(8/74-12/75) is 012. would the different part cause such hooky-dooky, or
should i let it ride, expect the camper to run lean or something, and look
into another source of the problem?
