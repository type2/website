Subject: Fuel injection for '73 1700

Subject: FI conversion from Dual Carbs on 73, 1700 engine.

I am considering going to fuel injection but don't know much about this. I
am
wondering what to look for and what vehicles with FI I could use. For
example, would VW rabbit or other FI work. What about Volvo, IF they seem
available.

Thanks in advance.

Hi Tom and all
My 76 fuel injected Kombi has been fitted at some stage with a 1700 motor
but the fuel injection has been retained.Goes well now that an alternator
problem(which affected the fuel Injection)has been fixed.
So I guess if your 1700 is in good shape you could find the FI system and
Fuel Pump and all associated relays and harnesses and use a FI 2000 setup.
If the engine is on the way out you may get a better deal buying a used 2000
engine complete with FI and rebuilding it ready to install.
