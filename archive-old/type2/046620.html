Subject: [T2] brakess

I have a 72 bus and My mechanic and I just realized the other day that it has 
power brakes on it.  We relized that the vacume hose was not hooked up so I 
asked my mechanic to do it and he said it can't be done because I have a 
single Weber double barrel carb.  Is this true?
