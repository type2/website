Subject: front bodywork

The place where the bottom of the main front panel meets the top of the behind-the-bumper area sheet metal, y'know?

It makes a lip that sticks staight forward (fif) a few inches.

Mine's pretty badly rusted, and it seems to affect a few pieces of sheet metal I can see in the schofield catalogue. (bumper inner/out skin, etc.) 

Anybody had this area rusted out and dealt with it?

Billy
