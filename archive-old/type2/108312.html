Subject: Re: [T2] what oil

Interesting thinking. The thing is though, the owner's manual gives you a
choice of oils to use including multigrades. I have tried SAE30 on my used
engine(now being rebuilt), and it smoked. Put in 15W40 Diesel oil, no more
smoke. I prefer to take advantage of advances in oil technology that have
come down the pike since 1970.

Have you actually noticed a drop in engine temperatures since switching back
to 30?

 Subject: Re: [T2] what oil


I've gone back to using straight WD-30 for my Type I engine after previously
using Mobil 1 15-50.

I changed after thinking about the engineering of the engine, particularly
the pressure relief valve, which causes thick oil to bypass the oil cooler.
