My experience isn't the same.  I run the same setup and it still
hesitates.  Not as badly as the 34, but the flat spot is there.

I need to find my timing light so I can play around with the dual vacuum
distributor I have.  It ran like a dog the last time I tried it (after
making sure everything worked properly), but I think that the problem was
more in my tuning than in the distributor.
