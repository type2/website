&gt;Only a few drops of oil ever reach the heads, try taking off
&gt;the valve covers and running the engine some time, you will only see
small
&gt;drops come splattering off the rockers, not near enough to cool a 400
&gt;degree head!!  The oil is for lubbing and cooling the lower end, not
&gt;cooling theend that makes the heat.



Thanks Rick. No argument from me. I have had the VCs off while running
(on my 914) and what you say is true, although there was enough splatter
to play hell with my specs and make it hard to see. What you wrote
previously made good sense and, along with the trip you described today,
convinced me to ditch the oil cooler idea, and also change my guage
order to a tach instead of oil temp, along with an oil pressure guage. I
have a pretty good feel for engine speed, but better to know the revs
for sure. The tin, lid and compartment air seals are all in place and in
good shape, except a small gap (about 1/4 x 2&quot;) right in the middle-rear
of the main engine air seal. What's the best way to seal that without
yanking the engine? Also, I am ordering new Bosch plug wiring with seals
as they are brittle. It does look like I have at least one small tube
leak on the right side and lose about 10 or 12 drops overnight, so I'll
find and replace that bank before I leave as well.  Any other prep
advice you may have would be appreciated.

One other thing worries me, as stated in my previous mail. Just by feel,
I doubt I could load this bus as you did yours and make the trip you
did. It just doesn't feel like it has enough power or torque to do that.
I know that &quot;sluggish&quot; is a subjective feeling, but that's how the bus
feels to me. Like, in my old bus I'd be looking at rejetting the carbs.
Plugs are new and correct (by the way do you run the hot or cool
plugs?), and timing is good. No pre-ignition, no flat spots, no backfire
on deceleration. The one thing I haven't checked is whether I'm getting
full stroke at the motor end of the accelerator cable. Any other ideas?
I've never driven any other late model campers, so I have nothing to
compare it to. I did drive some '90 vanagons before I bought the bus,
and the difference in pep and torque was significant--although the price
and vulnerability of watercooler parts, plus the shortage of parts and
shops in Mexico, led me back to aircooled.
Thanks again,

Jason, good to hear back from you, but you still have some
misconseptions
about the oil.  Only a few drops of oil ever reach the heads, try taking
off
the valve covers and running the engine some time, you will only see
small
drops come splattering off the rockers, not near enough to cool a 400
degree
head!!  The oil is for lubbing and cooling the lower end, not cooling
the
end that makes the heat.

Jake Raby said it very well the other day, HIGH RPM's heat up the oil,
LOW
RPM's heat up the heads.  Therefore, keeping the RPM's around 3800 will
keep
your engine as cool as possible.

Last summer on a 140,000 mile 2L engine, I pulled a 1300 lb Scamp
trailer
with my westy loaded with camping gear and 4 adults through your Cal
desert.
I went from lower Arizona to LA then back to Kansas, over mountain
passes
and all with no overheating problem.  I have put an additional 25,000 on
that engine pulling my trailer with no problems.  Of course the engine
is in
good tune, I run the 50w racing oil and Lucas.  I also drive the bus as
it
was meant to be driven.

Have fun on your Baha trip, sounds like a really great time!!

&gt; Still, even though as you say this is an air-cooled engine, it is
&gt; actually the oil that the air cools and that cools the engine.
