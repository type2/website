Subject: Re: [T2] Pivot Pin Replacement pitfalls

&gt; Also, there is no grease nipple that I can see on the front where I could

&gt; Should I put one in or just pack it full of grease when I put it back
&gt; together?
&gt; What kind of grease should I use?  The bentley manual doesn't specify in the
&gt; section what kind (haven't dug through any indicies though)

Dig in the depression facing forward on the pivot pin mount and you'll
find the grease nipple or the remains of a broken-off nipple.  Fix this
before putting in a new pin, or it might not get fixed.

&gt; Lastly I am planning on using the procedure outlined in the muir book or if
&gt; I can't find a suitable object I plan on making a contraption out of
&gt; allthread a couple of nuts and some washers as I don't really feel like
&gt; renting a tool from BB and waiting for it, worrying about breaking/damaging
&gt; it , etc.  Any tips from the folks that have done this before?

I did the same thing, using some all-thread, PVC pipe, and a socket to
pull both bushings out the bottom.  Select a socket slightly smaller than
the bushings and set it on top of the top bushing.  Thread the all-thread
through a big washer, PVC pipe whose ID is slightly larger than the OD of
the bushings, up through the bushings, through the socket, and screw a nut
on the end.  Put another nut on the bottom end of the whole works.  Start
turning the nut on the bottom and it will pull the socket and the bushings
down through the axle into the PVC pipe.
