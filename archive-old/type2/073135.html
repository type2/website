&gt;&gt;So I wired this huge Christmas wreath to the front of the splitty. So
&gt;big
&gt;&gt;it comes almost to the headlights.

&gt;Did you seriously do this? Because I've been trying to figure out
&gt;where and how to attach a wreath to the front of my bus for about a
&gt;week now

Sure, used galvanized mechanic's wire (baling wire would work), one wire to
each upper door hinge and one to the bumper. Of course it looks like hell
but if you saw the bus you would speculate that that might be the whole
point of the excercise. 8)
