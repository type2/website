A few scary moments this weekend as my 72 bus caught on fire in a 
crowded parking lot - have been lazy on 2 counts, 1) having never 
checked the fuel filler hose for cracks and general deterioration, 
and 2) having been running with a generator warning lite for some 
time (DID check charging system, but it was doing OK - regulator a 
possible culprit).

The fire was confined to just a few wires on the battery side of 
engine (those running from regulator) . . .  but of course that is 
also where the vent from the fuel filler comes down and is prone to 
fumes and leakage if things have rotted in there.  Having just made a 
quick stop and then into reverse (also relatively quickly) I'm of the 
opinion that the fuel sloshed a bit and spilled on the 
manifold/wires.  It's possible the regulator was in fact bad and 
contributed with some hot wires as well - probably won't ever know 
for sure, BUT

I REALLY recommend folks with older buses check that fuel filler hose 
(coming down from the exterior fuel door) as this was a previous 
thread I had not taken seriously enuff.  There is a BAD feeling 
seeing your beloved bus emitting voluminous clouds of smoke from the 
upper rear vents - you may not get away with just dousing it with a 
cup of cofee as I did!
