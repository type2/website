Subject: Battery Relay Question

Hi folks:

A quick question about putting a second battery in my 78 Westy (with 
79 FI engine).  I understand the science behind the relay and how it 
works, having had a similar system in my mail truck camper conversion 
in the 70's.  But where is the best place to install the second 
battery?

Thanks,

BEN
78 Westy
Too new to me to name yet!
