Subject: Re: Starting problem - FI?

Jeff wants the fuel system designed to depressurize for safety reasons as
soon as the ignition is turned off.  I don't know whether his (80 AFC)
does this, but the Bosch CIS (K-Jetronic) FI on a 74-79 Porsche engine
has a check-valve immediately after the fuel pump so that the pressure
stays up.  Symptoms of failure of that check valve are longer-cranking
starts, and no start (due to vapor lock) when engine is restarted hot.

High-pressure fuel line is a concern, which is why I set my engine up
with a low-pressure pump to get the fuel to the engine compartment, and
then the high-pressure pump right in the engine compartment, so I have a
total of maybe a foot and a half of high pressure fuel line run in the
car (rather than 10 feet or more).  As to risk from leaks, if I get to
choose, I would rather have the leak show up when the engine is off (and
the fuel lines are still pressurized) than when the engine is running.
