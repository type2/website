Subject: Re: Early loaf Westy questions

&gt; &gt;     2. Is it possible to put the two-person upstairs sleeping arrangement
&gt; &gt;     from a later loaf Westy in the earlier style pop-top that's hinged at
&gt; &gt;     the front?
&gt; 
&gt; I have a '69 Westy, and I was wondering about that as well. I'm guessing
&gt; there must be a space problem, as that's probably why they swapped the
&gt; poptop around.
 
Hey!  Just what Ron Van Ness and I were discussing.  He sent me the
following, which seems to cover the waterfront on late top to early loaf
conversion:

O'Hara.)

HTH,
