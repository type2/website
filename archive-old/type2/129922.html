&gt;According to the Bosch FI manual, this is what you should do:
&gt;
&gt;The trick is to NOT SKIP stuff just because you &quot;know&quot; it's OK. Verify 
&gt;everything in proper order.

YES, YES, just the simple truth in a nutshell. Follow info given by those 
who know BEST, the factory engineers. Buy the Bentley BEFORE you even buy 
an oil filter and oil. Even best to buy and review the Bentley BEFORE you 
go looking for a candidate to buy. Never assume anything, VERIFY in order.

Sounds like Greg has DM down pat, or has learned the same simple truths via 
his path of experience as I have by mine.
