Subject: RE: Michelin tires

I just have to say that about half the tires I've ever owned were Michelins.

I've tried other brands, and came back to Michelins.
New cars I've bought have always improved when I replaced the OEM tires with
Michelins.
I just replaced a set of 23YEAR OLD Michelins on my van with -- A new set of
Michelins.
BTW the old ones weather checked to the point I could see the wire belts
inside the tires, but
they still held together at up to 75MPH, and handles OK. In fact the new
ones seem a bit
wobbly, but I assume that is because they are made of rubber where as the
old ones were
fossilized into petrified rubber.

Just my opinion tho
