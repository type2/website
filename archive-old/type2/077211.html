Good point! Thanks.

&gt; &gt; Was it wasteful? Dunno - however I do know that my 120 HP 1966 Mustang 
&gt; with
&gt; &gt; a 200 c.i. 6 cylinder was much more powerful than my 90 HP 1981 Mustang
&gt; &gt; with the same 200 c.i. 6 cylinder. In other words they choked the engine
&gt; &gt; down with emissions equipment to make it cleaner. It had the air pump too.
&gt; &gt; I doubt that they would have reduced the HP if they didn't have to make it
&gt; &gt; that way. Gas mileage was a bit worse than the 1966 which was very worn 
&gt; out
&gt; &gt; and geared lower.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt;Also note however that between 1966 and 1981 the manufacturers also
&gt;changed very significantly the way they measured horsepower.  Back in the
&gt;'60s everything was gross horsepower.  That's the power of the engine with
&gt;no accessories.  Kind of an unrealistic estimate.
&gt;
&gt;Later on (I don't know exactly when) they went to the current system which
&gt;is net horsepower, and that's where they measure horsepower with all the
&gt;accessories and exhaust on the engine.  So basically horsepower as the
&gt;engine is installed in the car.  Taking into account horsepower losses
&gt;from the power steering pump, fan, alternator/generator, etc etc.
&gt;
&gt;So your old Mustang engine was probably a lot closer to 90 hp than that
&gt;120 hp number would have you believe.  Certainly power did go down
&gt;somewhat as compression ratios were lowered and emissions equipment was
&gt;added but before the current computer control technology existed which
&gt;allows for low emissions and high performance.  But the switch in
&gt;horsepower ratings needs to be given due credit too.
