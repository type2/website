Subject: Re: [T2] Shipping costs

Hi Richard,

I noticed this on Sunday, when I discovered a small tear on a  
dipstick boot.

I went to place an order at my usual supplier... The website quotes  
that part as $5 and out of stock. So I checked CIP_dot_ca, and they have  
them for $2.56.

BUT...  $10.30CDN to ship 10-day UPS Ground.!

Adding a couple more small items helps to ease the pain, but I would  
like to see the bus on the road in less than 9 days. And if I  speed  
up to 3-4 day shipping cost the goes up to $24.88.  Or $40 for  
overnight.

In the end I drove over to Canadian Tire and bought a $4.99 tube of  
Permatex and patched the tear. Now I have $4.75 worth of RTV left over!

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
