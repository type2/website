Subject: Fw: [T2] '78 Westy Camper prices - again



Subject: Re: [T2] '78 Westy Camper prices - again


 I think its just a push/pull thing. Old chevs did the same thing, for years
 everybody wanted a tri five or 58 and early 60's iron went cheap, not
 anymore. I've noticed the same thing,  its getting harder to find cheap
 early bay windows anymore.

&gt; &gt; I've lately been perusing ads on The Samba for early bay rigs, including
 campers, and the asking prices are often 2 or 3 times higher than I'd
expect
 based on long term experience.  Even rigs with major body damage &amp; rust,
 and/or needing expensive repairs are listed with prices of $3,000 and up.
