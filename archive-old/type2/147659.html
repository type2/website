&gt;does anyone have (can anyone get) photos of a rear sway bar installed??  
&gt;I have a set of 3/4&quot; bars bought used, the front mounts the same as 
&gt;stock (mmm, stable), but the rear requires brackets to be mounted, I 
&gt;haven't yet figured out where. . . it's not obvious to me from holding 
&gt;up the bar under the rear of the bus.  I need to fabricate angle 
&gt;brackets to mount to the lower spring plate bolts IIRC and can probably 
&gt;figure out the dimensions.  Also what are the dimensions of the end 
&gt;links (and especially the spacer between the bushings).

I have a lot of photos here:
