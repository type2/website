I just want to say that I'm incredibly jealous.  Nice air-conditioned garage.
Outdoor work area, too.

    My garage is a two car cement block building with a flat wood roof.  Guess
how many times in my 20 years it's been re-done (completely).  Three.

    My garage is heated.  My heater works on the hotel room shower method.
It's either boiling the air around your head, or your toes are frozen.  Usually
both.

    Exactly 60% of the floor space in this garage is taken up by stuff.  Not
good stuff.  Not welders, and benches, and project cars.  Two soap box derby
cars, infinite wheels for them, many car parts for cars I don't have anymore,
wood scraps, oil jugs, and anything else you could think of that would be hard
to walk around.  Once I fit a beetle in there under all of it, but the beetle
left, and the pile just took it's shape.

    How about working on my bus in the garage?  Well, I can fit it in there,
barely.  Once i installed a bubble light on the top, and in the morning, I
couldn't get out of the garage.  I can jack it up (floor jack)  to a
comfortable creeper height.  But when I do that, the light hits the top of the
bus, rendering it useless.  So I have half the light I once had.  And did I
mention that usually the bus is halfway out the door, because if I do pull it
all the way in, I can't walk around it without going outside?

    Speaking of outside, the driveway is asphalt, so I can't jack up the bus
without laying down many pieces of wood to keep the jack from sinking.

    So, I just hope you guys appreciate what you have.  One day, though, I'll
have the same thing.  I'll probably have to live in it, but that's ok.

    almost out of friday.

Plans to buy another bus are on hold, until next summer
when I will somehow have enough money to go to CA and buy one.
