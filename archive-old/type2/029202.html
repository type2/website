Hello.

I am looking for an Eberspacher 12V BN4  or BN6 heater for my '71 Westy.
I'd like to find a complete system in good shape and in good working order.
Can anyone help me with this?

I may be asking the impossible, but I need to find a heater so my
girlfriend will go camping with me again.  She won't go near the bus until
it has heat.
Talk about motivation.

Thanks.

Frank.
