&gt; Volks,       What is, in your opinion, the best torque wrench to own that
&gt; is applicable to most VW work.   All my sockets are 3/8 drive, but if a
&gt; 1/2 inch drive torque is better, then I'd just load up on 1/2 inch
&gt; sockets.  I notice that the 3/8 wrench goes from about 5 to 80 ft/lbs.,
&gt; whereas the 1/2 goes from 25 to 250.  Which one would be a better
&gt; purchase, and if I go for the 1/2 inch drive, then what about the proper
&gt; torques below 25 ft/lbs.?  I can't afford both.

Kevin:
I rather like bending beam torque wrenches. I think they are a good
compromise between accuracy and cost. When I was 16 the first thing I
bought with the proceeds of my very first paycheck was a Craftsman
torque wrench. At that time they also had Sturtevant logos on the back.
Click-type torque wrenches are more money and they're faster (I doubt if
they're any more accurate and I suspect less accurate). They are a good
choice if you're doing a lot of repetitive work like putting V-8's
together-small block chevys have 34 head bolts and I torque them in 6
steps- that's a lot of clicks. When I'm torquing nuts that have their
other ends in magnesium I like to go a little slower and more carefully.
Experienced mechanics can usually feel a bolt starting to yield witha
bending beam wrench.
Bending beam torque wrenches are allegedly most accurate in the upper
2/3 of their range, which means that the 1/2&quot; is good at 50-150ft-lbs.
I have a 1/2&quot; wrench, I think, haven't used it since working on Chevys.
Get the 3/8&quot; drive. BTW, get some high quality 6-point sockets to go
with it. I have S-K's, but occasionally treat myself to a Snap-on. High
quality tools make you look and feel good, especially your knuckles!:^)
