Subject: Re: Heads/GEX SAGA

Please, no hiney kissing! I will forward the message that I sent to GEX's
President Larry to anyone interested. Basically I make four points: 20,000
miles is premature by anyone's standards if the engine has been looked
after properly; that they replaced the first engine I bought from them
because of an excessive endplay (a one day delay at their cost); that
I expected them to assist in covering some or all of the costs; and that I
was in contact with many interested and potential internet VW users. Of
course I was much more delicate than this in stating my case ;). BTW keep
in mind I still foot the bill for labour which will be in excess of 700
dollars and will still need to replace some parts.

I suspect that had I really pushed on laboour costs GEX might have
resisted any form of compensation. In essence by taking in my heads and
shipping off rebuilt ones thgey nipped a potentially larger problem in the
bud.
