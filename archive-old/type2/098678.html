Subject: A bunch of FREE Junk, I mean CHRISTMAS PRESENTS, for the
  list!!!!!!

Hello List,

In the spirit of the season, I have a few gifts. 

Type IV bus &quot;OEL&quot; filler tube assembly complete with
dip stick and filler neck and cap.

One pair of NEW engine hatch hinge seals!

NEW Timing Plug that screws in the top of the fan
shroud!

One NEW &quot;gas injection tube&quot; This is the small brass
tube that you see when you look down the barrel of a
32/34 Stock Solex Carb used on 72-74 busses.

One ash trey that came out of an automatic bus. This
is only the piece tha slides out.

One NEW Bosch Distributor cap #1235522056.

One Type IV EXCELLENT Used oil cooler. This oil cooler
was throughly cleaned inside and out. It does not
leak. I made sure that all of the cooling fins were
straight and throughly flushed it with parts cleaner.
It was polished a bit and ther is no crud between the
fins.

One good used oil breather box from a 74 bus.

I also have some various Tin Pieces from a 74 bus and
the top 2 tin pieces from a 914 2L Porsche. I don't
have a complete set that I know of but if you neeD a
paticular piece, let me know.

A complete Driver's side front door vent window
assembly. It has everything except the ruber seal that
goes around it. It is in good working condition. It
does have some surface rust on the black frame but I
am going to wire brush that and give it a coat of POR
15. This assembly even has the felt that is attached
to it. Everything looks good on it. I just don't need
one.

Here is a picture that has the vent window and the ash
trey in it. Nothing else in the picture is available.

Sorry, but these are the only pics that I have because
I am unable to use the digital camera.

Everyting here is FREE!!! If you want somthing, Let me
know. These are my Christmas presents for the list. I
will probably find other things to give away as time
goes on. It is up to you if you if you want to throw
in a few bucks for shipping if you want one of the
larger items or if you get a bunch of items.

Happy Holidays!
