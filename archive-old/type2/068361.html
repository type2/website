Subject: '63 owner's manual

     If anyone has or has a reliable line on an original Owner's Manual in 
     any readable condition for Lea's '63 single cab, please e-mail me.  Im 
     looking for one to stash away for christmas for her.  The last three 
     meets I've been to have turned up nada, zip, bupkis (sp?).  Would also 
     consider a good photocopy.
     Ray
