Subject: Phoenix--Denver--Panora--Phoenix

Just came back from pulling our Eriba Puck 3500+ miles-- The RMMW show has
great.  RMMW fed us on Friday and the camping was done by the Colorado VW
Bus Club. On Saturday night there was a great Food Fest--The Colorardo Bus
Club are VWonderful Hosts!!  My thanks to them for making it a great
week-end--Sunday it was up to Denver for the VW Show--then after that it was
back roads or Route 66 to Panora Iowa--and back to Phoenix--Did NOT see a
single splittie!! purchased some very nice beer coolers--
Found some heavy rain.  The Puck did not leak a drop--Everyone wondered what
it was--They had not seen such a small camper--Fishing in Lake Panorama was
great--the catfish are BIG!!! Fastest I went was about 80MPH pulling the
Puck, 10&quot; wheels, it did stay on the ground!! Most of the time it was 65-70
MPH. Now its back to getting the HighRoof Beer Bus on the road--TWWM, uj
