Subject: Hot-Spark Props and tips

I melted my Hot-Spark at some point in my '70 Deluxe. I let Roy over at
Hot-Spark know and even though I didn't follow directions properly
(www.Hot-Spark_dot_com/Installing-Hot-Spark.htm) when installing the module. It
seems like didn't do the  Ohm test correctly and didn't apply the thermal
grease.

 

Roy sent me a replacement immediately. In fact I got a shipping notification
BEFORE he even replied to my email!

 

Rarely do I see that level of customer support!

 

Viva la Hot-Spark!

 

BTW, the Hot-Spark is a great module provided you run a resistor to your
Bosch coil. The Hot-Spark needs a total of 3.2 Ohms of resistance to not
melt. Below are my findings with some of the Coils I tested with and without
the Ballast resistor.

 

I have four coils and measured their resistance. I used a FLUKE 73II
Multimeter.

 

Below is my findings WITHOUT a resistor taking readings from the + and -
posts on the coil.

 

Bosch Black Coil - 221 119 025 / 043905115C - Made in Germany - 2.8 Ohms

Bosch Black Coil - 221 119 020 / 022205115C - Made in Germany - 2.6 Ohms

Bosch Blue Coil - 221 119 027 / 9220081083 - Origin Unknown - 3.0.5 Ohms

MSD Blaster 2 - 8203 - Made in Mexico - .8 Ohms

 

WITH the resistor I added. The readings are taken from the - post on the
coil and the + post on the ballast resistor. A connection wire connects
between the + terminal of the coil and the first lead on the resistor.

 

Resistor - CP-508 DALE - .8 Ohm 10% - Made in Mexico 0319

 

Bosch Black Coil - 221 119 025 / 043905115C - Made in Germany - 3.5 Ohms

Bosch Black Coil - 221 119 020 / 022205115C - Made in Germany - 3.6 Ohms

Bosch Blue Coil - 221 119 027 / 9220081083 - Origin Unknown - 3.8 Ohms

MSD Blaster 2 - 8203 - Made in Mexico - 1.3 Ohms
