ok volks heres the deal.... i got the bus fixed thanks to lots of  advice and help from many list members.... and mark for sending me the parts to make it possible....
   
  the sway bar bushing i could not fix right now so i wrapped it in a wire clamp for now till i can get another clip for the bracket.... 
   
  the bolt for the sway bar i happen to have one in the building that was very close just 1/4 inch longer no problem wont bump uglies with nothing under there...
  and the nut fit the threads the original nut that is for the original bolt...
   
   
  so after all that i got it back together...
   
  i have not driven it or moved it but she is on the ground.... all fours now and woooosh man its time for a cold one and a bud and i dont mean budweiser....
  LOL... work is done and yes i feel like i learned something... man ole man after all that i think i can do it again BUTTTTTTTTTTTT NO TIME SOON I HOPE LMFAO....and well i dont know if the top arms would be as nice to me....
   
  again thanks.....to all  of you knowing whom you are thaT has pulled together to see me through this dilema....
   
  i will post some pics shortly of the finish and send another update tomorrow of the test drive a mighty slow one i might add till i can get someone to tack weld the rest of them just for safety sake.....
