Subject: Engine dies  :(

So far...

The vacum lines are connected at the carb and seem to be ok. I am running a
generic type elec. pump and its set at 3 psi (not the FI pump). There is a
gas smell at the tailpipe so I assume gas is getting to the cylinders.

It tries to run, but just won't. It won't run at all!!  No idle. Does not
matter if I give it gas. It only fires and runs for a few seconds then dies.

A friend mentioned the cam gear (I think)...I reckon thats what turns and
makes the mech. fuel pump work. But I am running the elec. pump now
(temporarily).  Is there something else to look for?

I will check better tommorrow for a) vacum line connected at brake booster
and the inside of the carb for gas.

Thanks for all the concern so far!!! I only have 2 more days before the big
campout!!
