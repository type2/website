Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Stranded, Ignition switch won't turn all the way

Thats an idea.

Honestly I dont think the switch is the problem. You know that
mechanism that prevents you from turning the key while the engine is
running? - I'm thinking that might be the culprit, or something to do
with the steering lock.

We'll know in a few hours.

peace

&gt; If you were stranded like this, could you wire up a new ignition switch
&gt; and just have it dangle down rather than installing it below the wheel?
&gt; Would this hippie fix get you home or somewhere where you could do a
&gt; better job?
