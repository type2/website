&gt;I believe there should be some policy concerning the use of the
&gt;list to post negative comments which surely have a far reaching effect on
&gt;someone's livelihood.

You're talking in veiled legal language and I don't know why. The policy is
that you alone are responsible for what you post--we won't be responsible
for libelous postings. But this is academic because the message in question
was well within bounds. If the list is not an information resource then I
don't know what it's good for, and getting the scoop on parts vendors is
*always* an important topic because we live and die by parts.

Not that I haven't seen Ron libeled before, things used to go on on the
Vanagon list that would make you cringe, but he deals with it like a
grownup and comes away stronger than before.

If RMMW and WW want to impress me, they can come here and take blows to the
face like Bus Depot does. So far they haven't dared. Ron has run the
gauntlet from his first day in business (literally), and speaking just for
me, I think it's impressive.
