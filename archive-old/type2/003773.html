We will be leaving out in just a little bit today heading to Reno.  It is kind of a business trip/vacation trip.. we will be in my 78 Westy. It has been giving us a little problem but we think it will be fixed here real soon. it is a muffler problem.. not stock muffler and the baffle in it is causing the engine to get a little hot and shuts down.. 
So our trip will be from Jonesboro AR to Reno NV.
I wll be taking the &quot;list&quot; with us.. wave if you see us and we will wve back
Ken and Gail Doles
