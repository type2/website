[...] No!

Straining my brain back to basic physics/heat transfer theory, I suppose heat loss from
exhaust (therefore heat gain to engine compartment) is proportional to area of enclosed
surface and inversely proportional to thickness of metal (actually, log mean of
thickness, but that's another story.....)

So, if we assume an extractor exhaust is the same thickness as the stock system, then
we're gonna get more heat because the motor is more powerful, right? (Unless it's more
efficient as well). Also, because you're running DUAL silencers, the surface area has
jumped up a lot. So, the thing to do is minimise heat loss from the exhaust, by
wrapping it with heat insulation tape (like the racers do). Looks cool(ish), not stock,
etc. but it will work. Incidentally, don't be fooled by claims that this stuff will
increase performance by increasing exhaust gas velocity (higher temp, therefore less
dense, therefore same mass flowrate gives higher volumetric flow rate).

It is MASS flowrate that is important, to the point of extracting 100% of 1 cylinder's
exhaust gases in 180° of crankshaft revolution (ie. the exhaust of the next stroke). The
momentum of exiting gas 'extracts' the following exhaust, thereby giving a performance
increase. Typical values are 5% increase in power with muffler, 11% with 'stinger'.

Anyway, under-'bonnet' temperatures will be reduced by the use of the tape, which I guess
is your ideal. (But exhaust gas exit temp will be higher). Did you know that a turbojet
aims for maximum exhaust temp. while a turbofan (or turboprop) will aim for minimum?
Just an aside.......

Also, since radiation is proportional to absolute temp to the power of 4, high (eg. exhaust)
temperatures will have a MUCH larger impact on engine temp than you may expect. I'd
recommend a merged 4-1 header wrapped in exhaust heat tape, with a single quiet pack
painted matt black (colour makes a difference, because........oh it's too late but if you
really wanna know, ask and I'll enlighten you)

Paul (I have a degree in Chemical Engineering so will be delighted to discuss further
any theories on gas flow/combustion/heat transfer/efficiency of the Otto cycle engine).
