Dear Roland,

I think a large part of the problem with our loafs is that the horsehair
padding has disintegrated! When Gus was brand new and his upholstery was all
nice and fluffy, I thought he was the most comfortable car I'd ever ridden
in on long trips. Short of recovering his seats and using foam padding
(which I will probably do) or installing newer vanagon seats (which I don't
plan to do but which others have done with good results), I just get some of
those cushions you can put in plastic chairs to make them more comfortable
and use those for long trips. This doesn't do much for the backs of the
seats but I suppose one of those lumbar support cushions would do. If my
back starts to hurt I just stick my feet up on the dash for a while :-) . If
I'm driving, I usually lean forward with my elbows on the wheel or squish
back into the seat to stretch. Hey, I'm ancient and have arthritis to boot
and I still find sitting in Gus's seats more comfortable than being stuck in
a bucket seat with my legs tucked up under the dash mummy style like I am in
some of the Japanese and American cars I have owned.

As for the ride, Gus *is* a truck and I don't think much can be done to
improve that without seriously sacrificing what handling we have with such a
top heavy vehicle.
