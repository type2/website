Subject: Rear mats &amp; a strange top

Craig Koon asked the list about over-the-engine mats a couple of weeks ago.
A strange group of replies came back....
I had found a non walk-thru 73 with a charcoal grey rubber-backed mat that
laid over the whole area. [non walk-thrus have no spare tire well in the
left rear corner]
Today I found another non walk-thru bus!!! This one a 72. It has the same
charcoal grey material but it is glued to fiber-board. The bus has a metal
lip all along the rear edge just forward of the latch. The 'mat' is under
this lip and the front edge is held down with sheet metal screws and trim
washers.
I believe the difference is 73 has the engine access hole, 72 does not.

Today, I looked around in a self-serve wrecking yard in Bakersfield, Calif.,
about 105 miles south of Fresno. I found what at first looked like a 81
Vanagon Westy. It had Westy cabinets but didn't have Westy sliding windows
[regular Vanagon sliding windows have the latch at the front corner, Westy
sliding windows have the latch 14 1/2&quot; back from the corner so you can use
the screens] This is a Calif. version bus, it had electronic ignition. The
strange part was the top. It had a real Devon side pivot top!!! Neat top!
The ID tag on it said it was made in England, had a UK phone #. I don't have
a clue why this top is on this bus. Other than the 12&quot; square vent missing
on the center of the top, it was in great shape.
Will it fit my 67 Standard? &lt;just kidding&gt;
