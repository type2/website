&gt; I creeped under an orange baywindow with &gt;1973 body : it had a type 4

&gt; this list that all type 2 busses sold in Europe until 1979 had type 1
&gt; engines. Where and when were the type 2 busses fitted with type 4
&gt; engine in Europe ?

Volkswagen changed the engine compartment configuration for all buses in
1972 to accept the type4 engine.  This was then the only option in the US.
I have been *told* that as of 1972 the type4 motor was an option in Europe
as well, but I am not an European, so I can't be certain.  I am certain
that if you want at type4 engine in your bus, it is easy to install one in
any 1972-79 body, but far more difficult in the bodies made prior to that.
Nothing is impossible, but substantial modifications need to be made to
either the body or the engine to mate them.

OOK!
