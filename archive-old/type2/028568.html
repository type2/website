Andy,

I came across a similar situation some years back. My first rebuild, as a matter of fact.

I had .012 end play, but when I shimmed it down to where it should be, the crankshaft locked up, as you've described.

I was told that the thrust bearing had worn the outer part of the case and that align boring and trust facing would be required. In other words, the outer bearing closest to the flywheel was moving back and forth in the case. As I took out the slack, it moved back enough, I guess, to let the crankshaft hang on something.

I eventually picked up another case and rebuilt that instead. I still have the old case with .012 end play, but I've only kept it with the idea that someday i'd build one of those engines for the engine blow contest...but it's not the trust that led me to that decision; it's the fact that this case has already been cut twice and I wouldn't trust it much if it were cut again (align bored the third time). Some folks do, but I don't.

I'd suggest tearing down the case and measuring the bearings to see how big they are now. Thrust facing, I think, can only be done in conjunction with align boring (I could be wrong about this), so if the case has been cut twice already, I'd send it to the recycler...or build an engine for the engine blow competetion. ;)

Take care! Joe
