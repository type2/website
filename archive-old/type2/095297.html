Subject: Re: [T2] VWoA and the bus trademark

Have you ever seen the the old Life Magazine ad with a Delux Microbus 
sitting next to a big bus.  I believe the title was &quot;we learned a lot from 
the big guys,&quot;  grounds for action right there I might imagine.

&gt;
&gt; &gt;First off, I can guarantee that VWOA's trademark creeps are going to 
&gt;start
&gt;actively pursuing anyone who uses &quot;bus&quot; in their domain name, especially if
&gt;it is a VW oriented site. Watch out BusDepot, BustedBus, etc...  They did
&gt;the same thing when the &quot;new&quot; Beetle came out, and I fully expect them to
&gt;try to repossess the rights to anything and everything bus-related.&lt;
&gt;
&gt;This slightly interests me.  A &quot;bus&quot;  does not just pertain to VW.  In 
&gt;fact, that word was out many years before the VW was even around.  And 
&gt;furthermore, being a fan of all vintage busses, and not just VWs, I have 
&gt;seen many pictures of late 40s busses that the original microbus looks just 
&gt;like.  In that respect, it looks like VW could have been copying these 
&gt;passenger busses in a smaller scale.  Therefore becoming the &quot;micro&quot; bus.  
&gt;A big bus in small scale.  I would love to see a company like Flexible 
&gt;Flyer, come out and sue VWoA for some kind of infringement on the original 
&gt;bus shape.  Would that not be something?  VW does not, and never will own 
&gt;the &quot;bus&quot; name.  Beetle?  that is a whole different animal.  Never was a 
&gt;beetle before the beetle.  Thank God for busses before busses!Get more from
