I'm looking for recommendations for body shops in the bay area to work on a
1973 Transporter. Specifically, I need to have some pretty bad rust under
the windshield dealt with. In addition, I'm looking to repaint the entire
bus. I want the job done right the first time and I'm not willing to give my
first born.

Recommendations of shops would be appreciated. Rough ideas on how much this
should cost would also be appreciated.
