Subject: help with alternator wiring

I could use some help with the alternator wiring in my 79 westfalia bus.

4 wires come from the alternator, up through the engine tin into the right 
side of the engine compartment.  3 of them, (one red, one brown, one green) go 
to the voltage regulator where the red one splits off a blue wire.

The 4th wire in this bundle is black and is &quot;hot&quot; even with the key off.  It 
has a protected push on connector on the end of it.

Where should this wire go?  
What should it be connected to?

Any help is appreciated!

thanks,
