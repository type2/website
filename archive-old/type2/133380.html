&gt; Thanks for the response.  I gotta question for you.  The mechanic who has=
&gt; bus now - the same place that rebuilt the tranny - he's telling me that d=
ue
&gt; to having the incorrect linkage that when I put the bus in drive I could
&gt; actually be stuck between drive and second or first and that is what's
&gt; ruining the transmission.  Unfortunately I don't know a lot about
&gt; transmissions so I don't really understand what's going on (I'm slowly
&gt; learning though :)
&gt;
&gt; The mechanic thinks that the detents that control the pressure may be in =
the
&gt; linkage - does this make sense to you?

in the early automatic the detents are actually in the front shifter, but
if the mechanic had correctly followed the adjustment prochedures in the
Bentley manual he would have gotten the tranny linkage correct. the
adjustment prochedure is a real PITA but it does work.
