Subject: Re: [T2] Bulkhead removal and different front seats

&gt; I have a 9 seater microbus which I loath to change however my wife

&gt; get the comfort sorted its border line whether the wife will give it
&gt; the boot........ (Konis on the way to sort out the ride)
&gt;
&gt; What are my options? I am thinking Vanagon seats or is there something
&gt; better? My wife has difficulty depressing the clutch while driving as
&gt; the current seat is just a little too high.

you may not want a Vanagon drivers seat. it does raise the height, only
works on the later bays anyway, you don't mention which year your bus is.

&gt; I have a full width bulkhead. Too get more reclination of the
&gt; potential new seats I think I would have to remove it. Any comments on
&gt; removal? I have seen this thread

I had a 65 that I did not remove the entire bulkhead but I did convert it
from bench to bucket seats in the front by bolting a single seat on the
passenger side and cutting a slot in the bulkhead about 15-18 inches or so
to get a pass thru.  I'm not sure about removeing the whole bulkhead but I
was young foolish and this was a fairly newish and rust free 65 (heck I
did this in about 73 or so..)

&gt; seat. Here are some pictures of the front (the colour of the bus was
&gt; not my choice however its as solid as a rock and I'm getting used to
&gt; the green)

good quality rattle cans will get you any color you like (mine was that
color and we called it &quot;babyshit green&quot;)
