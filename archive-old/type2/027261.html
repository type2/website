the drag link i replaced the old worn out one with came with those nuts with 
the urethane (?) inserts and there was no hole for a cotter pin, like on the 
original with the castellated nut....does the urethane part go up or down? i 
heard that it goes up, but logically it would seem that it would go down so 
it would get compressed against the arm....well anyways, i put it up, and 
torqued it a little extra....seems like the cotter pin would be safer, the 
drag link is probably the worst possible part that could fall off while 
driving in the ozarks...
