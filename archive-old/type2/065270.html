&gt;VWs seem to be notorious for engine fires.
&gt;I really believe that 99% of these fires
&gt;can be prevented.  If you haven't replaced
&gt;--or had someone replace--all your fuel
&gt;lines and installed clamps at every joint
&gt;since you've owned your vehicle, spend the
&gt;time and few dollars and do this.

Know what? I did all mine this weekend (so I'm feeling sanctimonious) and
while I was doing the rubber lines, I figured I'd do the copper one to just
for the sake of good form.

I have never smelled gas in this bus. I have checked the copper line
regularly and have never seen anything that looked worn. But when I got the
copper line out, I noticed this place--looked like somebody had dragged a
hacksaw blade across it.

You're way ahead of me: I bent the line *ever* so slightly and the thing
cracked wide open. Shivery.

Really, really, really: replace and clamp. In the carburated ones, there
are only two joints you'll have to get under the bus for and they aren't
hard to reach. You people with the fuel-injected voodoo engines I can't
say, but it can't be much worse.

BTW, Auto Zone sells a little package of rubber whatsits that it calls a
&quot;wire grommet set&quot; (I think that was it). It's about $2.50 and there are
about ten whatsits in there. One of them exactly fits the 1/4&quot; copper line
we use for fuel line--pop that sucker into the engine tin and the copper is
isolated from wear at that critical point.
