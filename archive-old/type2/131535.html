Subject: Re: [T2] AIRS help needed Bus Down!

&gt;From: &quot;Rob Henley&quot; We got some M8 bolts about a 1/2 inch long from a 
&gt;fastener place, however the flex plate was mangled and bent and the last 
&gt;bolt wouldn't go in. We chopped down a longer bolt and got it to thread and 
&gt;it cleared, so I drove it up and down the highway and it seemed ok. I left 
&gt;and about 6 miles later I heard a pop and the torque converter rattling 
&gt;again. Looks like an engine drop and I NEED A FLEX PLATE at the least. I 
&gt;haven't looked into further damage yet as I just got home.


Anytime Rob atleast you are home now. I called a wlittle while ago and left 
you a message on the cell phone, I figured the battery was dead. I tried 
your house and the line was busy. Glad to know you got home. If you need 
some help let me know.

Hint when looking for a flexplate try some engine rebuilders if you can't 
find one. AVP told me they would install one on a longblock if I bought one, 
they have them from Auto cores. Guess how many auto cores are converted to 
manuals. Many more than the viseversa approach.

Good Luck,
