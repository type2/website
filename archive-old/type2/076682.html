Subject: Re: [T2] Temp on first start up.

2000 RPM is correct according to the Wilson book. I do not recall him 
making any mention of a specific temp. Considering the motor is not 
under load (not moving a bus around which he mentions will develop to 
much heat) it does not seem likely that the heads and consequently 
the oil will get overly hot. Then again as the parts wear-in there 
may be above normal heat developing on bearing surfaces, rings, cam, 
lifters etc. This could be the reason that it is better to break in 
on a stand instead of on the road :extra heat from break-in is offset 
by not having the motor under load.

I have never built a motor so this is just a guess. Good luck Ric!!!!!!!!!!!!
