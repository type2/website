Subject: Fw: [T2] 2 questions

 71 was the first year of vacuum assist disc brakes. As for the electrical,
who knows?
When I got my 70, I had electrical gremlins. Fuses were blowing for no
apparent reason. I was scared spitless, since I was in Oregon and I had to
get home to Ontario. I luckily made it home, but it started blowing fuses
even worse when home.

It turned out it was dust bunnies built up the the three dash switches,
which were shorting out between those many terminals on the light switch,
wiper switch, and emergency switch.
Disconnected the battery, pulled all the wires off(after carefully mapping
the wiring diagram color codes), brushed them off with a toothbrush, and
wrapped the terminals on the back of the switches with black tape to make
them less likely to short to metal parts of the dash.
Knock on wood, haven't had an electrical problem since.

&lt;#2.  Is any particular year/model known to have more gremlins in the
electrical system *by design* (nothing to do with POs by-passing ignition
circuits, or baked insulation, old switches).  And if the answer to this one
is NOT &quot;All years/makes are equally reliable&quot;, then does one year stand out
as
a shining beacon of electrical ingenuity?

Reason for asking, I am actually seeking one W/OUT vacuum assist brakes, and
in that vintage, the most reliable electrically; I do not wish to re-enact
the
under-dash fire I had when I had my 63 kombi.  TagainIA
