    When I was logging I used up all of my old oil myself, using it for
    bar &amp; chain oil in the chainsaw. Was kinda' dirty looking, and didn't
    stick to the chain like the $15 _at_ gallon stuff, but I just turned the
    flow up a bit more. Also burned some in a barrel stove, using a homemade
    copper pipe and valve arrangement that let it drip slowly into the wood
    fire.

I use it for bar oil some, but mostly for rust prevention
on farm equipment (brushed) and on the bottom of my bus
(sprayed).  My mechanic takes waste oil and heats the place
with it -- something I'd think mechanics everywhere would
do but apparently not.
