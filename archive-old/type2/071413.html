Fellow type2ers,

any lurkers out there need a bus?

It's with regret and pleasure that I'm moving lists (across/up/down?) to 
the Vanagon list.

a result of that is my '75 is now up for sale.

the details are as follows, or take a look at

new 8ply bridgestone tires.the color is 'texas yellow', but I think it's 
green.

Interior

The passenger seat rotates to face rearward. Kenwood cd with 4 speakers.
Variable intermittent wipers, rear hatch mosquito screen is perfect, 
pop-top canvass is also in good condition. but mosquito net has a few 
holes and the zipper only opens 40% of the way. has original front table 
and leg, rear table, stool, trash box, and front hammock, and the 
overhead rear
locker.
