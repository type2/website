Subject: RE: [T2] 1700 Cylinder Head Mystery Holes

Hello,

My 73 had these ports. The previous owner found some
screw on brass caps that he fitted on each one of
them. The caps were hexagon shaped and easily
installed or taken off with a socket or wrench. They
work great! The only thing that I can think of is they
are some type of plumbing hardware that he picked up
at his local plumbing store. Well, that was my 2 cents
worth. Have a great day!

Good Luck!

&gt; Hi Eric,
&gt; It sounds to me like you have a '73 head, ('72
&gt; didn't have them and the
&gt; head changed in '74). Those two holes, I believe,
&gt; are part of the air
&gt; injection system used in conjunction with a smog
&gt; pump set-up. What
&gt; should be in each hole is a threaded tube. On mine
&gt; I've just welded the
&gt; ends closed as I no longer have a smog pump. Perhaps
&gt; if you go to the
&gt; wrecker you can find a pair of these tubes to use on
&gt; your head.

&gt; 
&gt; howdee volks,
&gt; 
&gt; i purchased a used 1800 head for my 74 westy that
&gt; turned out to be a
&gt; 1700 
&gt; head.  with a bit of craftiness from a gifted
&gt; machinist friend it became
&gt; an 
&gt; 1800.  motor back together and running smoothly it
&gt; was as loud as a 
&gt; helicopter.  valves were readjusted, timing set, no
&gt; exhaust leaks.  the 
&gt; problem discovered was that there are two holes on
&gt; the head leaking 
&gt; combustion pressure. i see short wiffs of flame
&gt; during firing.  scared
&gt; to 
&gt; run it anymore.  each hole is just to the outside
&gt; and below the
&gt; outermost 
&gt; intake manifold bolt.  the cowling on either side
&gt; looks like it shows a 
&gt; place for a stud or something.  looking into the
&gt; hole i believe i see
&gt; the 
&gt; fins of the head along the circumference of the hole
&gt; and a valve. anyone
&gt; 
&gt; know how to remedy the problem of these mystery
&gt; holes or what the heck
&gt; they 
&gt; are?
&gt; 
&gt; mystified,
&gt; 
&gt; eric
