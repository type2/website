Subject: &lt;F&gt; Bus magic....

I was driving in my Pont**c yesterday and became so impatient at the drivers 
in front of me, I wasn't going to make it to work in time, or just wanted to 
hurry up and get to the store... just rushing myself too much. I realized 
then what Bus Magic is all about......

When I drive my bus (when I **drove** my bus - still under repair) there is a 
certain soothing feeling that comes over me. It becomes not all about getting 
there, it becomes all about the ride. Watching the pavement slip beneath the 
baywindow, hearing the sounds of the engine (listening for anything to go 
wrong). You learn patience. You learn to plan ahead for things. You learn 
what it means to take your time and appreciate the time that there is. You 
get the looks from the people in the other cars. The looks that say, &quot;Man, I 
haven't seen one of those things in YEARS.&quot; - and ALWAYS a smile and a nod 
from them. Then you can imagine the conversation that they start with their 
passenger(s) as they pull away at the the green light... &quot;I had a friend who 
had one of those in college....&quot;  Most people appreciate the bus for what it 
commonly stands for in society - the hippy. (Yes, we are sterotyped) Only a 
bus driver knows the magic of it all. I cannot wait for my fiancee to get 
behind the wheel and drive the bus. She wants to, but I'm not sure if she 
understands why yet. She will.. oh yes, she will.
    

It is bus magic
