 &gt; Jason,

 &gt; The part about the carwash having to recycle it's water may be true
in
 &gt; your are, but I assure you, it's not the norm for most of the
country.
 &gt; Furthermore, unless the carwash is SPECIFICALLY set up for dealing
 &gt; with oil/grease disposal, it is most likely NOT being filtered out.
 &gt;
 &gt; I have looked for this type of carwash for a long time and in several
 &gt; states (Idaho, Oregon, California and Arizona) as well, but have yet
 &gt; to find one. I finally asked a carwash owner why they were so rare.
 &gt; Aparently, they are cost-prohibitive to begin with and because they
 &gt; involve toxic waste, are subject to federal, state and sometimes even
 &gt; local regs. Again, costly.
 &gt;
 &gt; I'm not saying I don't use a carwash on the occasional basis to clean
 &gt; my motor (I do), but I don't kid myself as to where it's all going.
 &gt; It's going to the same place it goes if I wash it in my driveway.
 &gt;
 &gt; I think this is a sad state of affairs, as the government, in it's
 &gt; typically over-zealous (but miss-guided) attempt to clean up the
 &gt; environment, has made it virtually impossible for most of us to clean
 &gt; our motors in an environmentally-friendly way.
 &gt;
 &gt; If you have one of these increasingly rare carwashes in your area,
 &gt; you're very lucky.

Jaime:
In my town and I think in all of Iowa we have rather stringent laws
regarding floor drains in garages. When built they must have both sand
traps and grease-oil traps. This applies to residential garages as well-
if there is a floor drain, you must have this structure. This adds
probably $1000-$2000 to the building cost of a new structure, so most
hobbiest's garages don't have grease traps. What this also means is that
the majority of the grease-oil that is washed in a regular car wash is
disposed of at the landfill or recyclers and not loaded into the sewage
disposal system. I suspect it is so in most states, but if it makes you
rest easier, come to Iowa to wash your engine!(We also have good
pheasant hunting). :-)
