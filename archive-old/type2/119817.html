Subject: ignition wires

Ok, I got the ignition out- there are 6 wires coming off it
1) fuse box
2) starter
3) on while cranking
4) off while cranking
5) to driver door switch
6) ?????? it's cut off- gray color 
 
I can't find this in the Bentley or archives...
Maybe a wire to what was the BUZZER??
anyone know?
