Subject: [T2] front westy table

Hi all,

     I have a front table for a mid to late 70's westy.  It is complete with
all brackets, shims, screws, leg &amp; top.  The top is in good condition except
the side T-strip has shrunk to form a gap of about 1-2&quot;.  What's it worth &amp;
who wants it?  Maybe someone wants to trade something for it.  Drop me a
line.
