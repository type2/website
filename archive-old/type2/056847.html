When you do the double nut thing, are you turning the assembly with the
wrench on the outside nut?  Regardless, if the nuts start to turn you just
need to tighten them together a bit more.  It shouldn't take that much
force to thread a stud into aluminum anyway.

&gt; So, are the holes in these heads tapped using some kind of special
&gt; tap (tapered?, 100% taps?), and do you think something like 271
&gt; Loctite will save the day?  Or have I screwed up this head?

I wouldn't trust loctite to take up the slack, but I don't think you've
screwed up the head either.  All you need to do is put in a stepped stud
which has a larger thread going into the head and a smaller one that goes
through the rocker assembly.  You might have some trouble tracking such a
part down but it should be available somewhere.  Then just drill/tap the
hole to the larger size and off you go.

I'm not aware of that hole being an oddball size, but I guess it's
possible.  I've been lucky enough to have never had to mess with those
studs.
