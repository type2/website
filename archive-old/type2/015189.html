 Re: Carbureated '77?
&gt;
&gt;&gt;.  My question for tune-up purposes is, is this possible, did VW make a
carbureated 2000cc on a limited basis.  I heard they did by rumor, but i'd
like to get some confirmation on that.  thanks a bunch, andy
&gt;
&gt; Yes, they did but they used Solex carbs, not Webers (AFAIK). Singles on
1600cc engines up to about '82 or so and twins on the bigger pancake
engines from '72 to '82. They may or may not have used carbs on watercooled
busses but I don't know and its outside the scope of this list, anyway! :-).
&gt; Again AFAIK, FI was _only_ used in North America- the rest of the world
used Solexes.
&gt;

Err,no I think FI on Bays must have been more widespread than that.
In Australia we got FI in '76 on most Transporters but then seemed
to revert to twin solexes as standard from '77 but with the option
of FI. (corrections anyone...?)

I believe that while the FI was quite good,it wasn't readily accepted
at first by the buying public,so a return to carbs with FI optional
became the norm for '77-'79 models.But FI vans from the late '70s 
are quite common here...

FYI,

'92 Transporter WBX
'76 Crew Cab (good solexes but I wish I had FI)
