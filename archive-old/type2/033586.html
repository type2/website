Subject: supplementary heater

I've been searching the archives for a wiring schematic for the supplementary 
Eberspacher heater on my '78 westy. Everything that I've found is for the 
pre-1974 units. I even checked with Eberspacher USA, and they know nothing. I 
got my meater to work last night, I replaced the fuel lines first, thats all 
I replaced, What it looks like is the fuel metering pump is Not getting a 
pulsing signal that it's supposed to.  I gave the pump a seperate power 
supply and fed a pulsing power to it manually and the heater worked great. 
Only now I'd like to try and find out how to make it work on it's own ie; is 
there a controller or some sort of switch, or even an inline fuse that I 
couldn't find. I'm going back to work on it tonight, Fire extinguisher by my 
side, naturally.
