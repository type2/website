&gt;&gt;Another thing you'll have to do is support the engine so it doesn't tip over
&gt;&gt;when you loosen the gland nut.

The Type IV flywheel is held on by 5 hi-tensile bolts which are not that
highly torqued - they're not hard to get out with the appropriate
socket...From memory, there is also a 'hole' on the top rear vertical
surface of the case (on the other side from the starter) and you can put
something through this hole (like a socket extension bar) and 'lock' the
flywheel up so you can remove it and the clutch.......
