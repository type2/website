Subject: Tires for Westy

After more than a year of desultory work, we are getting ready to get China 
Cat on the road. She's a 75 Westy.

The tires that are on her are in good condition, but I question their 
suitability. They are Michelin Radial XH, P205/R15, rated at 695 lbs max load.

Anyone have experience with these or knowledge as to their ability to carry 
the bus? I've read some posts on the topic, but I don't remember anything 
except that the tire types suggested were far overrated for my 4700 lb 68 
Olds Toronado. I never understood why such heavy duty tires were required, 
unless it has something to do with the height of the bus/Westy.

If these tires are unsuitable, which I expect is the case, are they safe at 
some maximum speed? Info and &quot;experienced advice&quot; is welcomed. 

Cheers/Don Carron
