hey all...
Just picked up a nice 28PICT carb with the governor.  Both are
complete.  The governor says 28DR - 1,5.
The distributor is a Bosch.  It is the big cap style.  The code on the
tag is ZV/PAU 4 R 5.  Its a vacuum advance with the condenser inside the
dizzy.  1 piece points etc..  Looks to be in great shape and is
complete.

Make me an offer, or I'm going to try these out on my bus.  But I would
like to see if I could get rid of them to help finance my new 63.

Thanks!
Isaiah
