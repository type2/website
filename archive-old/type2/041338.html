Subject: Mechanic in Alabama?

Hello all,

I and my vintage 76 Campmobile will be relocating to sunny Auburn, Alabama,
in the next week or so, and I'll be looking for a good mechanic to perform
regular maintenance on this fine Sage Green machine over the coming years.
I'd be willing to travel as far as Montgomery, AL, or to Columbus, Georgia,
if necessary. (Yes, I know I should be doing the service myself, but other
commitments make this impractical right now).  I'm really looking for a pro
VW mechanic: quality of service is much more important to me than
rock-bottom pricing.  If any list members have recommendations in this
regard, I would be grateful.

Many thanks,

Jim Ryan
