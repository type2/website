Subject: Motor Up

Hi,
Was wondering if anyone has heard of a product called Motor Up? It's an oil
additive that's supposed to increase performance and decrease wear and
tear... It also apparently (I did say, apparently....) removes all the built
up dirt, grease and gremlins..... Do you think it's a crock, or worth a go?
Oh, and I did my first carb replacement job, got my Kev running for the
first time in almost 6 months and he goes like a dream!!!! (except the pesky
oil cooler thing, but that's a job for May)

Cassandra.

tye dyed curtains and pink n purple paisley carpet, purpleand yellow
interior and glitter dash... Soon to be painted..
