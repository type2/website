Subject: Save this CHEAP parts bus in NC!!!!

Howdy all. I've got to clear the yard, and have a 1975 formerly deluxe
Westy that needs to go. (in Raleigh, NC) I'm not one of those who idly
threatens the crusher, but the fact is that unless this bus gets taken by
someone with the space for it, I have no other options, as it's currently
a &quot;nuisance vehicle&quot; by city definitions and needs to go ASAP.
I'll be honest, a lot of the good stuff is gone, but the front &amp; rear
suspensions are there, some good glass, great blue plaid front seats, near
perfect nose, propane tanks setup, sliding door stuff, and tons of good
savable bits. Will roll onto a trailer...
here's a link to the ad, which details specifically what is missing.
Please note that those are old pics, and not everything visible is still
there. Price of $150 is super-negotiable, and really at this point I'd
just like to see it go to someone who will use it. Email with offers, ALL
of which will be considered.
Also have a roommate trying to sell a running 70 kombi for $1600, and a
different friend selling a 77 auto FI for $1k.
