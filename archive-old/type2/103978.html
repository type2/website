Subject: RE: [T2] Aftermarket Pull starter?

A friend of mine had a '61 with a 40 hp motor with a special nut on the
crankshaft pully.  This nut allowed you to stick a crank in through a
hole in the rear apron and give a twist.  The nut was a sort of rachet
affair which would release the crank when the motor started.
Worked like a charm when the engine was in good tune, which was all the
time.
