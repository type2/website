Subject: Deep Thoughts on Waving

When I was in college I had a friend named Tom Dolittle that used to wave at everyone he passed.  No! I mean everyone he passed!  Even at night, when there was no way anyone could see that one finger or hand raise, he still waved. 

 He was studying for the ministry, so for some reason we understood the waving, and why he did it, but that didn't stop us from picking at him about it.  I always felt like Tom had something to do with it in modern sports.  I wouldn't put it passed him.  

To me, It was based on the premise of being a servant, wanting to serve others so much that it didn't matter how trivial the act, just so it produced product.  Think about it, with all the bad in this world, here is one gesture of good we can all easily perform.  

It is simply a matter of fellowship.  

If you think about it, it truly is becoming one more minuet lost American practice.  i believe the drivers in the early days relied on each other more, therefore they had a stronger system of conduct than drivers today.

  When I was a kid I remember my father driving our 57 Ford, he waved at people on the highway and I would ask him &quot;who was that?&quot;, he would always say, &quot;that was a fella I might need to help me one day&quot;.  Of course he didn't wave at everyone, but he got in his share.

It's not the method you use, it's the madness behind it.  Today we seem to think freindly is wierd, that when someone we don't know, acknowleges our presence by trying to communicate with us that they are crazy and are singling us out to kill us or something.  We live in a parnoid world and I say, wave your ass off, practice random acts of kindness as often and wherever you can.

Maybe one of these days, we can all have a laugh in an elavator or something.
