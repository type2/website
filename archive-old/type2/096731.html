Hello All    I tried this earlier but never saw it posted so I'll try again. 
my .02 worth in my 59 panel that I take to swaps loaded to the top, running 
1835 dual dells, built motor ,this thing will haul butt. 70-75 no problem but 
oil temps get up to 250+ running that hard oil pressure remains steady 35psi 
, been trying different tests to lower the temps. different oils, found 50wt 
runs the lowest, ducting air into the engine etc. last thing was to bolt pie 
pans on thur the vents didn't want to drill into the body, this lower the oil 
temp 30 degrees!  Have never seen the oil get hot in traffic either. running 
at 50-60mph oil is at 180-210 . Later and have fun  Mark Dearing Salem Import
