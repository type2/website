Subject: won't put 79 into 72. looking for new donor

Thanks to everyone who responded to my earlier post about installing a 79 
motor and auto tranny into a 72 body. I'm not going to be doing it. Although 
I would love to learn to weld I don't have the money to do it. And when I 
was reminded that 72 doesn't have a top access lid to the engine compartment 
I decided it wasn't worth it.
But if anyone has a decent body within a day or so of NC let me know.
Also, if anyone has a donor bus in the area they are looking to part with 
let me know. (even if the body is poor there are other parts I am looking 
for.)
Thanks a lot every one.
Kyle
