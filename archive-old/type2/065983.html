Hey does anybody know where I can get a set of rear bumper brakets for a '68
bus. My got smooshed in an accident and I had to cut them off. I looked in
the bus stop catalog and the ones they had were $73 a pair, and weren't
stock. I don't care if they're stock or not but I need them to be a little
more reasonably priced. BTW, I can't find a VW junk yard anywhere near here. :(
