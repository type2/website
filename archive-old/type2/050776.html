Subject: [T2] distributor/electronic ignition

i saw it mentioned that one can use a vanagon electronic ignition on a
bus, i am trying to decide on the best replacement for my 009 and this
option struck me as a good idea, i like electronic ignition setups.
Could someone give me the details on this ? i searched the archive but
have come up empty...maybe i saw this someplace other than the list, but
if anyone knows anything about this i would appreciate any help.
thanks
Jamie
