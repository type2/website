Subject: FW: [T2] Why not to live in pretentious neighborhoods

&gt; I mean, how could somebody be offended, call the cops, and have the
&gt; cop show up in 7 minutes?!?!?!

Don,

You can move next to me and my neighbor who works on his MGT/B all the time.
We are both scorned but I just smile and wave my middle finger (in my mind).
Most of the folks are tolerant, but someone keeps calling the code
enforcement on me too even though I have the nicest looking yard and home in
the neighborhood.

I can take it though. Driving a really rare and cool VW sure beats driving a
FORD EXTINCTION, CHEVY TOTAL or some OLDSMOBUICK around...

They can all live their vanilla, bleached, extra-helpings-at-TGI Fridays,
Must-see-TV, Oprah watching lives and shove it. We will just keep smiling in
the far right lane!

Jon
