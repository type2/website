As a general rule, Jason's advice should be applied to everything 
connected to a bus. The reason is to be found in the thread on 
aftermarket parts.

Some aftermarket parts are as good as OEM, and some are better. But 
most (IMHO) are trouble.

Case in point: the positive battery cable on my bus looked ratty to me 
and was corroded at the clamp, so I thought I'd do my bus a favor and 
install a new clamp. Got one at three stooges, complete with the 
necessary extra lead. I hooked it up and it looked great. A few weeks 
later, I found I had smoked my alternator. The extra lead had simply 
separated from where it was crimped into the clamp. Without that lead, 
an alternator will give up the ghost. Fortunately, I was traveling with 
a (borrowed) spare alternator, but I had sprung for a new regulator 
before I identified the alternator as the problem. In the end, I had to 
shell out $40 for the regulator and $80 for a rebuild before returning 
the (rebuilt) alternator to its owner. All because of a $10 aftermarket 
battery cable.

That was the case; this is the point. You cannot simply spend your way 
to a better bus. You have to take care, too. If a part can be cleaned 
up, rebuilt, refurbished, etc., that should always be the preferred 
choice  -- as long as the part can be restored to original spec.
