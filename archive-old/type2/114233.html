Mine is also on the dash and I've often caught the police gearing up at the side of the road to stop me when they realize there is indeed a plate present as I approach.

The main reason I have it there is because when I moved the holes for the CA state plate did not line up with the holes drilled into the bumper. Some made some holes near the top of it and used sheet metal screws. The screws rusted and the holes widened and now it doesn't hold a plate well unless I use nylon ties. I'm going to put a proper bracket on instead of modifying the plate (I noticed that some plates have oval slots and some round holes).

I can just see a big debate ensuring about the stock configuration but this 77 image suggests where the mounting holes should go and also indicates which bracket should be used:

using this bracket:

instead of this one:

On the rear, there is also no license plate bracket and some PO simply drilled 4 holes into my engine lid. The alignment of the plate is good but there are two extra holes presumably from a mistake or an earlier plate with the holes in a different position. I was going to put a bracket on then decided that with the engine compartment locked it would be harder to steal the plate without a bracket so I'm just going to fill the extra holes.
