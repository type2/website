Subject: Re: [T2] New 1776 into a 69 = KaChunk

As an aside... each year when I start one of my cars (i.e. MGA) that have
been put away for a long time (i.e. winter) - I always run the starter
(never too long at a time) with the ignition off until I see some oil
pressure.  Once I see pressure, I then reconnect the ignition to start the
motor.  Just my $.02

It's total hindsight, but I wanted to throw this out for general use.

When putting a new engine in it's always a very good idea to remove the oil
pressure switch and make sure that the engine will pump oil out the opening.
Not only can you verify a pump is primed, but even more important (like this
case) that there is actual oil flow.
