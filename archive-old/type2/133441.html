&gt; Narrow edges or sharp corners would have their force spread across the

&gt; Regardless, I have a mount (not yet installed) that I'll be putting on
&gt; because I like the way it balances the look of the bus. Plus it gives
&gt; more cargo room in the back.

yeah I wasn't thinking safety when I put my tire up front, like you I like
the look and you can't put a sheet of plywood in the back with the tire in
the way...also if/when you have a flat tire it is easier to get at,
although I do reccomend a lock on the tire so it is still there when you
need it.
