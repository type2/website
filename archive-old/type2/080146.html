Subject: Stud removal

Ok I know this has been asked before but my ex mechanic just told me something
that I do not trust... AS he just sold me the wrong size stud...  I think he's
out to get me but...one of the studs that comes out of the heads broke barely
but just enough that I can't get a nut on it.  So I am trying to remove. Not
budging.  My ex mechanic said to use a torch to loosen the aluminum...  Is
this right, if so how much?

TIA

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
