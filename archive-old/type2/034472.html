Subject: Late Trans into Early Bay

Not much luck in the archives on this one. I was given a trans, I think it
is a 75 (was told I would not have to saw the shaft off any). I really need
to put it into the 68.

It looks like (according to Bentley) there are significant differences both
at the nosecone end and the bellhousing end. I wonder if I can just pull
the nosecone and bellhousing/throwout off the 68 and bolt them up to the
late trans? That seems too easy. 8^ )
