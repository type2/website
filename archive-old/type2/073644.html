&gt;Hi Jeremy,
&gt;
&gt;Horsepower starts with compression. 
&gt;
&gt;If the bus has been sitting that long, remove the tin and inspect the
&gt;cylinders from mouse or wasp nests. These can block airflow and the
&gt;resulting heat buildup could cause a valve seat problem, thus ending
&gt;compression &amp; power.
&gt;

Also, overheating in short order can warp the rings=compression loss.

&gt;It could also be a vacuum line, but I'd start with the compression test.

Even a &quot;tune-up&quot; should include a compression test.

&gt;&gt; Ok experts, here's your puzzle:
&gt;&gt; A 1973 day camper (no poptop) with recently (professionally) tuned 

So, what were the compression numbers?? They didn't do a compression
test???? Not professional. Indeed, if they agreed to do a &quot;tune-up&quot; they
didn't read the Bentley, that's why they are, proof posative, not a
&quot;professional&quot;. There is no &quot;tune-up&quot; procedure in the book. Only
maintenance inspection procedures show. A true professional knows the
difference. If they don't know the difference, they are not professional.
If they don't follow given procedures, they are not professional, just
wannabees. 

A &quot;tune-up&quot; is too many times at least a partial waste of money because
parts are replaced that don't need replacement. It's a license to waste
your money and drive up your cost per mile. Is it not a total waste to do a
&quot;tune-up&quot; if the problem is in fact just a loose vacuum hose or perforated
advance diaphram or loose hose clamp or manifold bolt or??? 

If you ask someone to do a &quot;tune-up&quot; on any German car and they agree to do
so, you are not talking to a professional. A professional will inform you
that he doesn't do &quot;tune-up's&quot; on German vehicles. He will ask you why you
want a &quot;tune-up&quot;, what are the symptoms and let you know that he will
diagnose the problem and fix that, then review with you your maintenance
history and followup on the currently due or over due maintenance schedule.
And if you keep the maintence schedule current, you will never again feel
need of a &quot;tune-up&quot; and you will know to keep your hand on your wallet
whenever talking to a &quot;professional&quot; who suggests you should buy a
&quot;tune-up&quot; from him. Guaranteed he will want payment for that &quot;tune-up&quot;
whether it fixes your problem or not.

&quot;Tune-up's&quot; are a panacea for unmaintained vehicles.
