&gt;&gt; Did you do this cut yourself? If so how/with what did you cut it out and how
&gt;&gt; did you keep the shavings out of the sump?
&gt; 
&gt; My GE case came like that. All I know is that some cases don't have the
&gt; cutout.

hydraulic lifter cases have the partially blocked &quot;well&quot;, on a solid case
the area is open to the main sump volume. this is one of the subtle
difference between solid and hydro cases, there are a few others as well,
like the oil pickup tube is a different length.

the easy way to check what kind of case you have is to look for the oil
pressure overflow valve on the side of the case just above the lifter bores,
near # 1. there is a 14mm XZN screw head which is the cover for the valve.
if you have this, you have a solid lifter case. hydraulic cases do not have
this valve. 

&gt; I believe the sender still clears the case but the warmest oil won't
&gt; reach the sender.

the stock 914 sender will not fit in a hydraulic case. but don't worry
because the 914 sender is the wrong one anyway, it is 400 degrees, there is
no VDO oil temp gauge that is 400 degrees.

as for the temp readings, i can verify that with a 914 sump plate setup
(with the short-nosed sender) in a hydraulic case, the oil temp readings are
very &quot;lazy&quot;. the gauge still works, but it responds very slowly, taking a
very long time to reach max temperature, and also taking a very long time to
go down if the temps go down. i have had the same sender setup in a solid
lift case and the gauge reacts much more rapidly, as there is much greater
oil flow in the region of the sender.

i made a page with some more info, i wish i had documented the case
differences, but the sender is covered pretty well.
