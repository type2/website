If it will not idle at 7.5° BTDC, I suspect a carb problem. Either a
clogged jet or idle jet the wrong size for that motor. Many of them come
with jets for the 1300/1500 type III motors. Could be just out of adjustment. 

That 40° total advance is a bit scary. I wonder how certain your 'visual'
top dead center mark is.

Verify compression balance. Verify valve settings, hydrolic or mechanical.
Verify ignition. Verify fuel delivery volume and rate. Verify fuel charge,
either carb or fuel injection. With the carb, verify base throttle setting,
verify float level, verify the fuel bowl is clean, if not, clean it, the
whole carb, then reset the base adjustments, fire it up and do the final
tuning at stock timing.

Remember, you have a stock f.i. cam profile which carbs don't work best
with. Only stock works best. If you have the dual element vacuum advance,
do not apply vaccuum to the retard side, then reset the timing stock. Make
sure the advance hose is hooked to the proper fitting on the carb.

Get the Haynes book on Weber carbs. It gives all the info needed. Lots of
original equipment jet settings listed in the back. I think these DFEV's
were stock on English Fords, Cortinas and such. They were adapted for the
type III's as an alternative to keeping the f.i. ground wires tight.
