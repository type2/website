Hi David,

FR12 made by Intercool is not the same as freeze 12
(or Freezone or Autofrost or HotShot).  Intercool
claims freeze 12 has more R134A in it, operates at
higher pressures and doesn't cool as well.  Of course
that's Intercool talking about their competition.

When you used R134A in a bus, did you convert the oil
to ester?  Does R134A leak out of the old hoses (a
horror story in the early days of R134A)?  Notice with
Intercool, they say to completely convert to FR12 you
should add about 30% ester oil if you have the system
open, or at least add 2 oz ester if not draining the
system.  Also they say the FR12 must be charged in
liquid form.  All of Intercools comments sound
reasonable to me.  I sort of wondered, putting 2&amp;2
together whether any system would work fairly well
using R134A as long as you added 2 oz ester oil.  What
do you think?

Rob
