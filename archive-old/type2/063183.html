David,

As you know, I transplanted the drive train from my wrecked '78 into the
'73 that I now drive.  The drivetrain in the '76 consisted of the stock FI
equipment, a GEX rebuilt 2L block, and a used tranny from a '79.  The '73
came without engine or tranny, and the earliest breadloaf tranny I have
seen is the one in my '76, which seems to be identical to the '79.  As
part of the transplant I installed the tranny hanger off a '79 parts bus
that I used to transport the engine back from the accident. During the
installation I had no problem with the physical dimensions of the units.
The front tranny mount, rear tranny hanger, and engine cross bar were
located in the same places.  *HOWEVER* the shift rod coupling wound up too
close to the nose of the tranny by about an inch.  To get the tranny and
shift rod connected, I had to drop the engine and tranny back out, clear a
flange on the frame that blocked forward travel of the shifter cage
out of the way (this flange did not exist on the '79 frame BTW) and guide
the shift coupling onto the shaft during installation.  That procedure
allowed me to physically install the unit.  Getting it to shift was
another matter.

While I know the theory of moving the gate plate at the bottom of the
shifter about to get the shift pattern in the right place, I have never
been very good at it.  This one totally defeated me.  With the gate moved
all the way to the rear, and the shifter down between the seats, I could
get to neutral, first, and third.  By crawling under the car, releasing
the front coupling and drilling a second hole in the shift rod back about
1&quot; I got the shift lever into a more normal position.  At that point I
started on the right/left adjustment.  I could get to either first-second
or third-fourth but not both.  Took it to my mechanic, who worked on it an
hour or two, and gave up.  He finally got it to the point where I can find
all four gears, with reservations.  Third and fourth are correctly
positioned, but first and second are roughly where third and fourth would
be on a 6-speed box.  It ain't perfect, but it is drivable and I am
getting used to &quot;free-form&quot; shifting.

I used to believe that a front end accident prior to my purchase had
physically shortened the frame, but after measuring it, I no longer
believe that.  I believe that there are differences in:

      o position of components of the tranny.  The end of the shift stub
        on the '73 *must* be an inch or so to the rear of where it is on
        the '79.
      o length of the shift rod.  To make up for the increased length of
        tranny.
      o width of shift pattern.  The distance from the first-second leg
        to the third-forth leg may be wider on the '73 than the '79.

I am sure of none of these conclusions since I have not yet seen a '73
box, but that is the best theory I have been able to come up with.  Once I
get the '76 reliably on the road, I intend to have the tranny out of the
'73 and try to assemble a complete matching '79 and '73 shift set and
compare them (OTOH, I may just be dreaming :-)

If anyone out there can confirm or refute these guesses, please, please,
Please post!
