Subject: gas tank sealing for lazy people
Message-ID: &lt;14bd04c7.24479e54_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Me again-

There is quite a bit of rust flakes in my tank, every time I swish some more 
gas throgh more flakes come out.  I would like to seal it or whatever or at 
least wash out the stuff thats in there.

My problem is I am not mechanically inclide at all, and I'd be a huge pain 
for me to try and take the tank out and I'd probably brake something doing 
it.  I also don't think any mechanic around here is going to be able to do 
it.  Is there any junk that I can just plug up the outlet (all the exit fuel 
lines and exit little nossle and tank screen are off, so its just the exit 
hole of the tank) anyway, any stuff I can just plug up the tank, pour it in, 
and then drain it out?  I'm assuming most of the rust is probably near the 
bottom anyway so I'm not so concerned with coating the entire inside.

I have heard that some sealants can come off the walls over time and clog up 
things, true?

Thanks for any help.
Shawn
