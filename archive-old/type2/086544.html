Subject: Westy fridge question...

------=_NextPart_000_0013_01C1C9E2.F28E79E0
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hoping this wonderful group could help me with this one. I'm trying to =
figure out which fridge I have in my newly acquired 1980 Westy (2.0L, =
air-cooled). I'm assuming it's a Dometic and there is no gas hookup on =
my camper so it's go to be AC/DC. I've found literature online about the =
RM 182, but mine doesn't have ANY controls on it ANYWHERE (that I can =
find). I'm trying to get the specs on it so I can attempt a repair. The =
previous owner told me they never used it. Any help would be greatly =
appreciated.=20
