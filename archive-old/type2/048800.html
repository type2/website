Subject: [T2] 65 for sale Germany

I stumbled across a coach built 65 bus today through the grape vine.  It was 
original used for the delivery of mail here in Germany and has a couple 
unique windows to boot.  It is in fair shape and I'd pass it on for the price 
quoted me.  1000 dm or around 500 bucks give or take depending on the 
exchange rate.  The numbers over here are seriously diminishing and don't 
expect for the fatherland to do much bailing out on parts and projects in the 
future.  Some of the guys here are starting to import the beetles back from 
California and Arizona.  Keep Cool......Air Cool(ed)
Peace Out
