Subject: Re: New welding question

I'm not sure that I know the answer to this, but I thought I might throw out
a couple of ideas:

1 - Spot welders usually cost about $300-$400 dollars for a decent one, they
usually require their own 220 volt power supply (some require only 120, but
the good ones 220), they USUALLY use air compressor power for the clamping
mechanism.

2 - A lot of times, when you remove the actual panel, you have to deal with
panel fitment?

Hell if I know... if I was going to replace a huge panel, and I was able to
completely remove the entire panel at the spot welds, you can be sure that
I'd buy a spot welder anyway.. I mean, damn, it would save you a LOT of
time.

I'm still a novice at welding... I used to think that anything that doesn't
require a college degree, I could easily teach myself in a couple of days.
Anyone that tells you welding isn't an art and that it doesn't require any
skill... has probably never tried to weld themselves.

I've been fiddling with my Lincoln Electric for almost 2 years now, and only
in the past couple of weekends have I made that &quot;breakthrough&quot; to where I
actually feel like I know what I'm doing.

But damn, I would defintely use a spot welder instead of having to weld all
the seams.

&gt;
&gt;I lied. It's actually the same welding question. I was afraid it might
&gt;have gotten lost in all the political deliberations on gas and taxes.
&gt;
&gt;Whenever I see articles or write-ups about replacing full panels, the
&gt;work always seems to be done with brazing or by cutting the seams from
&gt;the replacement panel and welding the panel in as a giant patch. I've
&gt;never seen anyone do a replacement by spot welding. Why not? Why aren't
&gt;more repairs done by restoring the original welding style?
