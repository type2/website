  I have a type IV engine long block from a '73 VW in my garage and I 
need to get it out of my way.  I would like to trade it for perhaps a 
good engine stand, an old type 1 engine, or whatever you have to offer.
I have sold the '73 VW that I used to have and purchased a '71.  I am 
in Apex, NC (very close to Raleigh, NC).  I will not ship it.  I guess
I could load it in my truck and deliver it, if it was for a nice trade
item.  The person I got it from has had VW's all his adult life.  They
became a hobby (he owned 5 or 6 when I bought my VW from him) and he
said the engine was in very good condition when I got it from him, but it
has been sitting in my garage for about 3 years now.  Anyone close to 
Apex need a type IV long block?  Let's trade.
PS  It has the manifolds for the dual carbs on it.

'71 Hardtop (not a pop-top) camper.  Kind of like shaken, not stirred.
