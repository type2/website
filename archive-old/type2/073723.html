Courtney, it is possible but depends on your risk and economic factor. Mains
can be good but you dont know what little pieces might have worked their way
thru the oil galleys. The right way of course is to take it all apart,
inspect and mic all pieces. But sometimes when you dont have enough time or
money you can risk pulling p&amp;c's and replaceing rod bearings without
splitting the case and start saveing money to do the job right. Your
probably on the right track, if the noise is there at idle and goes away
with rpm your looking at big end bearings.

&gt; I was sure I'd heard a rod knock at idle with my 1 yr old purchase 79
Westy,
&gt; but couldn't quite decide if it was an exhaust leak or whatever. Last
night,
&gt; in preparation for the Puyallup VW show, the oil was changed, and lo and
&gt; behold, nice big flakes (one almost 1/4&quot;) of bearing material were lying
in
&gt; the sump. :-( This engine had just had a top end rebuild, and the P.O.
dork
&gt; must have not done the bottom end. It's an automatic, so guess what I get
to
&gt; do this winter? What fun. :-(
&gt; Any comments, suggestions, opinions on doing this ? Any chance the mains
are
&gt; gonna be ok and there is a way to test them? I thought maybe I could luck
&gt; out and just redo the rod bearings without splitting the case? (Ha ha,
what
&gt; wishful thinking). Sorry guys and gals, just had to vent.
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Courtney
