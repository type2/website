Subject: Coleman Plat Cat heater

I used a spanking new Coleman Plat Cat heater on my recent trip to Organ 
Pipe National Monument. The temperature dropped as low as 32F, but no 
lower, and there was a fair bit of wind. I had the top popped the whole 
time and ran the heater from the time I closed up the bus after suppers 
until the time I went to bed (about 2-3 hours) and again in the mornings 
(again, 2-3 hours).

The heater was ideal for these conditions. It was mildly stinky for the 
first day or two, but with winds gusting to over 30 mph I wasn't too 
concerned about any build up of vapors.

The heater kept my nose, ears, and toes comfortably warm. It also warmed 
up the can of butane I use to make coffee in the morning (which, when 
half empty, was too cold to boil water).

I did not run the heater while sleeping. I don't know whether I would if 
I needed too, but I didn't need to (lots of sleeping bags and wool blankets).
That made for a cold first thirty seconds every morning, but things warm 
up fast once you get the device going. (The best plan is to travel with 
an SO, and make her or him get up and start the cat half the mornings.)

I think this heater would probably do a good job at lower outside temps 
if the poptop were closed or if you have a well insulated bus and an 
insulated liner for the poptop and canvas. Under those conditions one 
might begin to be concerned about providing adequate ventilation. There 
must be some ideal way to move fresh air into a bus, and stale air out, 
without compromising the benefit of the heater.

The heater isn't adjustable, and it has no thermostat. There are just two
settings: as hot as it gets, and off. I had to turn it off several times
because I was too warm. 

It is a shame that there is no thermostat, because Plat Cat heaters do 
not need to be relit once they are going -- they can cycle on and off as 
do electric heaters (and with a lot less noise doing so). 

I have a CO meter in Peregrine, and it stayed silent the whole week.
