Subject: BA6 heater connections

Are you running a BA6?
Through the kindness of a list member I now have a functioning switch for my
BN4. The BA6 switch has a built in rheostat but I have a question about how
it functions. If anyone out there understands this please write back. Is
there an external thermostat that plugs into this switch or is the
thermostat within the switch? The timer while ignition is off and the
ignition on part of the switch work fine.
Thanks in advance,
Joel
