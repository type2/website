Hi everyone,

I am planning to head out to Carlisle for the Import Nationals in May. This will be my first time at Carlisle (last year my engine died on the way...). I seem to remember that there was some discussion a while ago about whether to reserve a camping spot or not. Am I right assuming that we can just stay with our campers on the show field overnight and do not have to bother reserving camping space?

Marcus
with hopefully 2 cars at Carlisle:
59 Opel Olympia Rekord PI
79 Wety deluxe
