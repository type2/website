&gt;Please, please, quit screwing up word wrap. your mail client even &gt;goes far enough to take my seperate line replies &amp; make them one &gt;line.

I format my messages to look appropriate before I send them. If someone would care to inform me via pmail of how to do this more efficiently, I would appreciate it.

&gt;I agree the pump is trying to pump a constant volume of fluid. But
&gt;there is a world of difference between pumping liquid into a pail
&gt;(this is called zero pressure) and pumping liquid into a pressurized
&gt;container (in our case the fuel loop). You cannot just say &quot;well the
&gt;pump pumps this much fluid with no load on it therefore it must pump
&gt;out the same amound at 50psi&quot;.

Of course this is true. My contention is with how pumps fail. Do these fuel pumps fail in such a manner as to incur reduced efficiency before complete failure, or is is all or nothing. Someone with more experience with these pumps would know better than I. My postition rests more on an all or nothing pump. Your point is valid.

&gt;This guy still doesn't know that his pump can deliver the
&gt;required volume at operating pressure. So we haven't eliminated the
&gt;pump yet. What he can do w/ the gage is to hook it up, run the &gt;engine
&gt;untill it quits &amp; make notes of what the loop pressure does. If it
&gt;keeps going down then it quits, chances are he is starving the pump
&gt;either from a restriction in the line or bad filter (which he did
&gt;replace).

You're still leaving out the pressure regulator. Simply sticking the guage in the loop will not tell you whether it's the pump or the regulator. Each must be isolated, which brings me to my volume/time method. Though not foolproof, it helps make an educated decision about where to go next. You can't driveway test the regulator like you can the pump. 

&gt;The lines I was refering to &quot;can't replace&quot; are the two
&gt;metal lines coming out of the fuel tank, while they are small other
&gt;than trying to clean them, if there is a restriction at that point
&gt;then he can't simply remove them &amp; replace them w/ a new set.

You're talking about two tiny large sweep 90's fixed to the tank. Wire brush &amp; solvent?

&gt;We aren't testing the fuel lines. Well not directly. I am suggesting
&gt;testing the entire circuit as a whole, depending on the results he
&gt;gets from testing he should be able much more acurately to diagnose
&gt;the real problem. Replacing the lines can be part of the repair, but
&gt;shouldn't be part of the repair process.

We ARE testing fuel lines. And pumps and regulators. The focus is NOT the circuit as a whole. We're past that. This guy has directed us to the fuel system. We are now trying to help him isolate the PART of the fuel system at fault. Pressure gauge tells you low pressure. Is is restricted lines? Fuel pump? Regulator? Injectors?.
When he goes and buys his pressure gauge and tells you that he's proven his suspicions of a suspect fuel system, we're back to square one with zero knowledge of which part is at fault.

1. replace fuel lines
2. check injector electrical/spray pattern
3. perform basic pump test
4. replace regulator with known good.

This process addresses the troubleshooting and maintenance issues in a logical, productive manner with thought to cost.

Jason has made many valid points, and I believe I have too. 

YMMV
