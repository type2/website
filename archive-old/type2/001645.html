I pulled a REALLY nice awning off a junk bus, and grabbed the hardware too.
A &quot;c&quot; shaped channel was bolted to the rain gutter and an awning with rope
sewed into one side fed down the channel to secure it nicely to the bus.
The &quot;donor's&quot; rain gutter had rotted, esp around the bolt holes. I dont want
my unrusted bus to go that route. The metal channel that bolts to the rain
gutter is aluminum I believe. Some folks have suggested to me that bolting
aluminum to steel will cause a &quot;reaction&quot; and result in rust.
    I think the &quot;reaction&quot; and rust is due to not painting/caulking the
holes and bolts properly. (especially since water doesnt leave the gutters
as readily with the nuts in the way. )
    Should this metal to metal be a concern?  My bus is too nice to let
rust. On the other hand the awning is awesome enough to make me consider
putting a non-stock item on the jewel. It came off a bus that was used to
tour flea markets and vend, and it is sooo sturdy and gives tons of great
shade.  Do you think I can make it work?
