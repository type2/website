As much as I dislike controversy (who me? hah!) I have to agree
with you 150%   

Although all of the list-spawned e-bus-business (old volks home/bus depot/
type2parts_dot_com)seemed to start off great, and were an excellent alternative
to the local FLAPS &amp; the established mail-order companies,  it seemed
that they reached a critical mass and then melted down.   I've been
trying to get sheet metal parts from one vendor for several MONTHS now,
to no avail.  
All my emails seemed to go to dev null, but ironically, when I posted
soemthing for sale, I got  an email from said party almost within minutes...
I ran myself ragged trying to get rubber from another vendor, constantly 
getting the wrong pieces, and pieces I ddn't even order.  I ended up having
to order from WW in order to get the correct pieces and get them in time.

I am in need of a bunch of parts right now for the new panel - both rubber and
metal .  An exploratory email has already been sent, that appeared to fall on
deaf servers.  OTOH, if I were to post that I had a nice rear bumper for sale, 
I know I'd hear from him in a new york minute.  No, I am not going to
play the game where I have to unload something from my stash in order to 
earn the privelege of buying repro parts.

So, if you're going to go into business, more power to ya.  But you have to
remember that you're competing against *professionals* (Wolfsburg West, RMMW,
WCM)  and people will only cut you so much slack before they say screw it, and 
take their business back to the pros, which may cost a little more, but at 
least you get the stuff you order, and in a timely
fashion, which is way more important to me than saving $1 or $2 on a window seal.
