Subject: Stock thermostat, 79 FI 2L

hey guys,
Just tidying up some loose ends on the new van I bought. I noticed the
thermostat wasn't hooked up. One of my pet peeves is how so many people
think it isnt needed and just unhook it! The thermostat apears to be good,
when cold its at its short length. Its written right on it, 85/90 degrees. I
tested it per bentley but it didn't grow to there spec, but when I heated it
to 90 it expanded to its full length. So can anyone give me any specs as to
temp vs length, or is the bentley right? And as for adjustment, wouldn't I
best to adjust it to provide full open rather than full close as they show
in the manual? I looked in the archieves last night and dug up lots of
useful stuff, but nothing that answered my question 100%. thanks
VWMIKE
