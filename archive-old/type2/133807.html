Subject: re: spark plugs

Hey Nik,

I had one blow out, and put a heli coil in it. Never had another 
problem with it.  I dropped the engine because it was easier, but you 
could probably do it with the engine in place.  When you do it, take 
a grease gun and load the cylinder up with grease.  It will catch all 
the shards of metal.  Then, with all the plugs out, turn over the 
engine by hand and have a rag ready to catch the lube.
