&gt;  I'm just wondering if it is possible to switch back now without breaking
&gt;open the case. I guess I'll just be pulling out the hydraulic lifters and
&gt;putting in regular ones,right? Anything else I need to do?

Lots of people have reported success with exchanging lifters on cams
both ways. You must use the matching push-rods. The rocker shaft hardware
is also different, but the lifter and push-rod will do it.
