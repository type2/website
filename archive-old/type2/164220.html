Subject: dent in pushrod tube opions requested

Hi,



I have a dent in a push rod tube at the drivers side, closest tube to the
bumper.



I was doing a repair to the motor to get rid of a leak, perhaps would be the
reason for the leak?



It runs along the push rod tube, about &lt; inch and about 1/16 to 1/8 deep.



No damage to the push rod at all.



Alan
