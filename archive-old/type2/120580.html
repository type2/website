&gt; Ok after spending all day dropping engine and tranny on my 73, replacing

&gt; started right up but won't shift into 2nd or 4th...  :(

You do know that the later transmissions are ~2cm longer than the earlier
transmissions?  You may try adjusting the shift plate at the front and
hope for the best or you might have to remove the set screw linking the
front and rear halves of the shift rod and drill a new set screw landing
point in the shift rod to shorten it up enough to give you adjustment
room.

                             OOK!
