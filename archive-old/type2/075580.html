Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Pump for a 78


That's for sure, Al. Always validate the filter and flow before condeming
things down stream. That's the order of things per Bentley.

&gt;Mark:
&gt;I think the filter or intake pipe is plugged. NO $127 or $220 pump will
&gt;make up for that!
&gt;Remove the old filter, fuel should just run out, BE SURE YOU ARE READY !
&gt;Have a clamp pliers/ plug ready.
&gt;Replace the filter. Give the old one an autopsy and see if it was plugged.
&gt;
&gt;Try compressed air on the gas filler if fuel doesn't run out. As a last
&gt;resort, blow it backwards. Be really careful to only allow about 20-30 PSI
&gt;into the tank, they are not made to be an air compressor tank!
