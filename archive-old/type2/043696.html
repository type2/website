Subject: Rust Wash

I seem to recall a web page somewhere that advocated spraying the inner 
and underside body components of one's vehicle with oil.
Another method which I have seen used successfully by old timers who 
live along coastal waters is to periodically wash one's vehicle in 
kerosene. I'm not advocating this, but as a comment, i must admit, it 
did seem to work for the old man who showed his car to me. As to 
environmental impact, the need for waxing more often as a result of 
this practice, you decide....
