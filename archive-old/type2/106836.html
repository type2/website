&gt; Hello List:
&gt;
&gt; I am getting ready to order tires.  I have settled on the Yokohama Y356.  I
&gt; am trying to decide which size to order.  My choices are 185/0R14 D (max
&gt; load 1850) or 195/75/14 (Max load 1710).  My instinct is to go with the
&gt; stock size and higher load rating.

You have good instincts.  Pay attention to them!

If you put a tape to the tires when mounted, you will find that the 195/75
is a bit smaller in diameter than the 185.
