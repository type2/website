&gt; Too late!
&gt;
&gt; Your talking about vacuum problems and running a centrifugal only
&gt; distributor, Power issues thru all the gears,
&gt;
&gt; Stop now and get a proper vacuum advance distributor,
&gt; then you'll be eliminating variables.

I have to agree here, I have a 78 and it came with a 009 and I had the
same problem, finally found a decent correct distrbutor and it was amazing
the improvement it made, just that.

find a correct vacuum distributor as fast as you can...
