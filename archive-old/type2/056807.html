it holds

&gt; &quot;Hammerite&quot; .  I sprayed a few parts  with this and it looks nice

When using oven cleaner, you have to be sure that you get all residue
cleaned from the parts or you invite corrosion.  This is particularly
hard with the fan shroud, as access to the inside is difficult.  You
also have to be sure that all those bare spots (inside and out) get
painted!

I've had no problem with Krylon, but Rustoleum is ususally a bit
cheaper and works fine.  The finish of the tin is somewhere between
gloss and flat.  There's a black called &quot;modern flat black&quot; that has a
finer finish than flat black that seems to be a close match.  Remember
that the factory finish was far from a &quot;show car&quot; job!

High temp paint is not needed, as the tin doesn't get all that hot. 
You need not worry about the color or paint harming cooling, as the
shroud does not radiate that much heat.  You may paint it any color
you like (wasn't Bob Hoover painting his blue?)
