Subject: Turn Indicator Attachment?

Hello All,

Was wondering if anyone had a creative fix to the turn indicator mounting
situation on the steering column?  Mine (on my 71 Bus) won't stay
stationary and seems to have lost some type of rubber ring which supports
it atop the dash-&gt;steering column bracket????

The local guys know what I am talking about but have no idea where to get
one and suggest just using electrical tape to create one.  That seems to be
the trend at the yards around here as well...

It almost looks like a dust seal from the rear wheel bearings might work?  

Appreciate any ideas, and would like for the thing to stay put and cancel
itself after the turn and to not blare the horn at the most inoportune
times :)

Much love,

Brian Allen
71 Bus
