Subject: [T2] re: Subject: Split bus fails to deflect armor piercing

My dad encountered another service member at the end of WWII in Europe
who was attempting to take apart a Kubelwagen and ship it home.  The
Kubel had apparently been strafed and rolled over on its side; it
appeared it was crossing a bridge over a small creek/gully when strafed,
made it to the other side before rolling.

&gt; Are those busses available for a resto?  Little body work and they
&gt; would be ready to go!
&gt;
&gt;
Know anyone stationed in Baghdad? Might be cheaper to pick up an &quot;only
blown up by a little old terrorist on weekends&quot; bus and have it shipped
home as personal transportation... ;-)
