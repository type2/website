Subject: Re: Source for 12V lighting fixtures/accessories?

&gt; &gt;If anyone knows of a great place to get (likely mailorder)
&gt; &gt;12V lighting fixtures and 12V accessories, I'd appreciate the
&gt; &gt;info.

Another place to check is truck stops.  Surprised at all I saw when I 
happened to wander into one last night.  All these trucks need stuff for 
their sleepers...
