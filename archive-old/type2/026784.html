I believe that is wrong. The laws of physics predict that the forces on the 
two sides of the tread of the tire are in balance. Thus, a tire with 27 psi 
will have twice as much tread on the ground than the same tire/same load at 
54 psi. The tire will thus &quot;crown&quot; from side to side as well as 
circumferentially as you raise its pressure. The tire manuals for years have 
shown photos of abnormal tire wear related to over and under inflation that 
reflect this physical law. I'm pleased that you are back to 30/40, Mike, we 
need all our list members to remain in good physical condition! I'll wager 
though that unless you  typically load up with all the seats occupied and/or 
carry alot of heavy goods, you will find the center of the treads on your 
tires wear faster than the edges at 30/40.
