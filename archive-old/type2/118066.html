Subject: Re: [T2] cheep 'n easy rust removal

Step right up!
        You say you wanna remove that rust but it's just too much 
hard work? Saw this over the weekend and it really works...
First, get a container large enough to hold the object you want
to derust. A plastic garbage can of appropriate size is OK...
Second, fill with water... enough to cover the object.
Third, clean a spot on the object (wire brush, whatever) so you'll
get good contact and attach the negative clip of a battery charger.
Fourth, get a fair sized piece of stainless steel or clean steel and
attach the positive clip of the charger.
Fifth, immerse both in the container; careful they don't touch.
Sixth, turn on charger.
Seventh, add washing soda (sodium carbonate) to the water until
the meter reads 1-2 amps. Arm and Hammer makes a washing
soda, but I'm sure there are other brands.
Eighth, wait and see...Takes a few hours but when the little bubbles
start forming on the rusted piece, you'll know it's working.
After a few hours, check the progress, and brush off the rust. Con-
tinue until the rust is all removed. 
Then, quickly clean and dry the piece and primer or seal it... 8-)
