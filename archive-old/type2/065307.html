&gt; 
&gt; I've noticed ads in the VW rags for an anti sway bar type, camber
limiting
&gt; device, that bolts underneath the transaxle of swing axle type vehicles.
&gt; Will this device work on a 66 bus? Is it useful, safe, effective?
&gt; 
&gt; All responses are appreciated.

&gt;My friend says they help greatly the handling, as well as reducing the
wheel hop associated with reduction boxes
