Subject: cover on the side of the bench seat?

A somewhat related question I wanted to post separately is whether or 
not there is a cover on the side of the bench seat legs.  My bus does 
not have this but I wonder if it was removed.  I saw it on a bus on ebay 
a few weeks ago and it caught my attention.  I looked at the microfiche 
diagrams and saw it only on the fold down seat so I was confused.  Look:

If somebody could explain this I would appreciate it.  If this is 
something I need for my 76 bench seat and can help me out with then pmail.
