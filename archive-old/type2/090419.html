Subject: Dual carb wrap-up.  Atlanta, GA to Archdale, NC. Nikki's bus made
 it. 

Volks,

First, a word of thanks to those who responded...  It is deeply
appreciated!  Also a word of thanks to Steve Bradley who followed me all
the way.

Second, I made it!  Not without incident, but Wendelin is at Kelly's
place.

Third, I have never run a dual carb bus, nor have I ever worked on them
until now.  That is one *wierd* settup!  And badly misnamed!  It is  not
two carbs, it is *three* carbs!  It took me a while to figure out, but
that left &quot;carb&quot; actually contains two complete carbs within its casting.
The one you see is the brother to the right carb and contains the &quot;main&quot;
circuit for cylinders 3 &amp; 4, but up forward on the body that &quot;idle
circuit&quot; is actually a complete second carb cast into that body.  *Very*
wierd!

Lastly, the incident is that after travelling 270 of the 300 miles, the
bus began to act funny.  I was having to floor it way more often and it
would not hold speed on hills.  I also checked the fuel gauge and I had
used more than 1/2 a tank of gas, which was way worse than on the first
leg (we had refilled at ~200 miles).  I was worried, so I pulled over to
check it out.  As I pulled off, the engine died every time I let off the
gas in neutral. The engine was quite hot and there was a big run of gas
out the filler neck.  The bad gas mileage was at least in part that I had
not gotten Nikki's non-stock cap back on correctly, bu tthat did not
explain the heat.

My first suspect in overheating is always a vacuum leak, especially since
I knew Nikki's to be marginal to start with.  Started looking about at the
various hoses and saw that the brake booster connection had come off the
right hand carb. Put that back on, but the bus still would not idle.
Steve Bradley looked into the engine compartment and pointed out something
laying on the tin next to #3 and asked what that was.  It was the engine
cut off solenoid that had come out of the idle carb and was creating a
huge hole in that carb!!!!  We tried to thread the solenoid back in, but
it was stripped.  We went into the gas station and asked for and recieved
(FREE!!!) a bolt to thread in to seal the opening, with a dab of permatex
to seal it.  After that, the bus idled just fine.  I suspect that the #1 &amp;
2 valves will again be &quot;tight&quot; after this excursiuon, but we could not
afford to wait, so we did the final 30 miles to Kelly's place and there
Wendelin rests for the moment.  I intend to return to Kelly's before Nikki
comes back to fetch the bus in order to reset the valves and do a real
check on the carbs.

The lesson to take away from this is that if your bus starts to act
&quot;funny,&quot; even a little.... PULL OFF!!!!  I don't know how far I went with
the hoses off, but evey mile was making it worse and 30 more might have
killed that engine.  You know your bus, you know how it *should* feel and
if that feeling changes, stop and find out why!!!!

                           Steve Dolan
