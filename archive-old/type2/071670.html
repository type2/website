Subject: Digital Temp Sender Resistance
Message-ID: &lt;ef37e7ca.24bd6a9c_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I've been reading with interest about adapting a digital food thermometer for 
oil temperature.  It sounds like a good idea.  I just bought a temp gauge and 
a dipstick sensor, which I haven't yet installed.  The instructions emphasize 
that you should not shorten the wire between the sensor and the gauge.  My 
guess is that the whole thing, sensor plus wiring, totals a given resistance, 
and that the resistance changes with changes in temperature, like a thermo 
couple, so that the gauge is really reading resistance.  If that is the case, 
how would the phone wire and its length affect the accuracy of the reading 
&gt;from the digital thermometer?  Obviously you're talking about a 6 inch length 
between display and sensor versus several feet, although of a different 
gauge.  Of course maybe the thermo couple sends the reading to the gauge 
digitally.
