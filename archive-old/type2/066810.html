Subject: pitted cv problem decided

Ok
Going with the advice of Sage Hoover I decided to not use
my pitted cv, but to search for a good used one. I have
a lead on one locally here, and if that fails someone
( sorry I forgot who) told me Transform sells them
rebuilt. I imagine in rebuilding they fill the pitts
with weld then machine it down to specs. This is just
a guess though.

I installed my radio that I bought a year ago for my bug,
which I sold sans radio, in my bus last night. So this means 
that although I cannot drive my bus out of the garage yet,
I can listen to tunes. Although I do not have an anttena (sp?)
so I must rely on tapes. 

I hope to have my bus ready for tagging by next week.
Yeah!!!!
