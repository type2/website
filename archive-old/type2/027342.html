This talk about the condenser change-out problems and another listee's 
request for wiring help on the low voltage side of the ignition system led 
me to check out the wiring on my 1.8L '75's coil. Low and behold I 
discovered that the condenser (which is mounted conveniently on the coil 
instead of the distributor) was for all these years attached to the wrong 
pole of the coil!(#15 instead of #1). So maybe now I'll get a better spark 
and longer-lasting points in the future. But imagine all the sparks that 
have gone by with an inadequate dampening of the arcing from those 
points...I sure would like to know who goofed when they replaced the 
condenser. At least with the condenser mounted on the distributor you can't 
make that mistake!
