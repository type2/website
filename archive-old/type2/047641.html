Subject: Re: [T2] VW Emblem

Seals I've used for VW have all been overlength and required trimming after
instalation.  Do you see a channel the remains of the old seal is in.  It may be
pinched in a few areas.  Slide in the new seal and pinch the channel at a few
points to hold its position.  If it is tough to push in, I use a soapy water
solution for lubrication.

&gt; Can anyone tell me how the engine compartment seal(s) go in a 69? The
&gt; old ones were pretty much gone, and looked like three separate short

&gt; they're two long bendy pieces (the &quot;firewall seal&quot; was backordered). I
&gt; have nothing to compare to.
