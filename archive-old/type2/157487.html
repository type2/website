Subject: Re: [T2] what would grove the push rod

Mario - when you look at it, is there any indication
as to whether this is a current condition or is it
likely that it happened before the rebuild or even an
out-of-engine event during the rebuild? It seems to me
unlikely to have occurred at the bottom end where you
found it. If it did occur inside the engine, my
suspicion is that it was inverted previously and the
problem occured in the head area.

No, I have not seen it personally, but I like David's
suggestion that it could have been caused by the
failure or incorrect installation of the retainer
spring-wire that holds against the tops of the tubes.
Very likely scenario. -BaH



&gt; I just took the #1 exhaust push rod from an engine,
&gt; I was told was recently  
&gt; rebuilt and found it has a grove about 10 mm wide
&gt; and 2 mm deep about 2.5 cm  
&gt; from the lifter end.
&gt;  
&gt; I will be pulling the push rod tube and the lifter
&gt; tomorrow but was  hoping  
&gt; someone might have seen this before and could send
&gt; me in the  right direction.
