Subject: Candanian headlight problem

Here's an idea- don't let your kids drive all those modern cars!  
Really, whats an airbag compared to a chance to really connect with your 
vehicle like you can in an old VW?  Even in my mom's '87 Quantum I can't 
get that feeling- too new.  Wouldn't feel the same even though I can 
turn the lights off when I want.  Even with the motorized (sometimes) 
sunroof open, it's not as great as driving in Hildegarde.  Well duh!
