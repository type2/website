Dear Dave,

The photos are great and your bike rack looks really sturdy. From the
pictures, it looks like it is entirely supported by the bolts on the bottom
which goes through part of the frame and the bumper without any support from
the top. Is this the case? How is it bolted on the bottom?

You've done a great job! It looks really good especially the new slider.
