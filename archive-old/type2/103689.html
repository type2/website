Subject: Re: [T2] F.I. to Carb clarification

-----


&gt; as wiring, FI brain, etc, and transplanting the whole
&gt; system into a bus that is not wired for it.
&gt; If the latter, what ALL would have to be removed from
&gt; the F.I. bus to go into the non FI 72 bus, and where
&gt; can I mount all the stuff?
I did this exact job to my 72 a few years ago when we consolodated our 3
busses into 1.
We had a 73 with a progressive weber and a 75 w/FI 1800.
I pulled the gas tank, complete 1800 and wiring for FI(consists of  wire
harness you can find by following the cold start valve wire from starter,I
believe it is yellow with red stripe, anyhow, its the one on the ignition
side of starter that your 72 does not have)
This harness should complete the FI system if everything in the engine
compartment is complete.
  Mounting will turn out to be easier than you think if you are not to anal
about it looking perfect.
My brain (FI brain that is) nests comfortably next to the wheelwell on
passenger side near where it would be if I cut a hole for it.I hung all the
other stuff (flow meter, decel valve, etc) from the ceiling of the engine
compartment as if it were mounted on the stock bracket from the 75 bus.
 To some who are more fastidious than I this will sound sloppy but it works
great and not having a top engine access door in the 72, it makes the engine
easy to work on not having the air cleaner mount there.
  If you dont have a friend with a FI bus to look at as reference while you
do the job it might be good to take photos of the 2 litre in place before
you remove it.
