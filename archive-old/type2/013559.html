&gt;On my rear axle:
&gt;the back of the castellated nut was boogered;
&gt;both ends of the hub were boogered;
&gt;the inner race of the outer bearing was both boogered and split across.

Steve:

I like your creative use of adjectives.  Is &quot;boogered&quot; an American form of &quot;buggered&quot;???  I sure hope I don't find my rear axles in boogered condition when I finally get around to restoring them.  Actually, now that I think about it, I'm a little afraid to look at them.  Maybe I'll enlist the help of my 4 year old niece, who is quite comfortable with anything that's &quot;boogered&quot;.
