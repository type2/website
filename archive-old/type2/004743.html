Daniel,
May I suggest a couple things.  New pushrod seals to start, then pressure
wash the engine, go to NAPA or wherever and get a tiny bottle of engine oil
dye.  Put it in your oil, then shine a black light in the dark on you r
motor and you will see where other leaks are coming from.

With a qt of oil being used that fast, I would suspect your valve cover
gaskets are not seated correctly as well and need replacement when you do
the pushrod seals.

&gt; It has been 110,000 miles since a rebuild.  Oil consumption is now about a
&gt; quart every 150 miles.   But, I just went on a 500 mile trip with full
power
&gt; on the interstate, travelling about 65-70 mph.  Sometimes a bit of blue
&gt; smoke from the tailpipe.  I also got about 22-23 mpg, about like this van
&gt; has always been.
&gt;
&gt; Other things to consider besides rings that might be causing this much
&gt; consumption?  I do have leaks at all the lifters...and leave a big spot
&gt; whenever she sits parked.  Seems I would not be getting good performance
&gt; with this much oil consumption.
