Justin,
At one time we were getting the Brosol *made in brazil* 34 pict 3.  Now it's
the Bocar, made in Mex.. Some say the Brosol was the best of the two. But,
they are no longer available in a 34pict3. I have never had a problem with
any of the new Bocar's, when adjusted properly they make a big difference in
the  performance on a stock 1600 DP.

I have a brand new one, a very slightly used one, and several other used
ones.  I was planning on taking the used ones to the  Pomona  Car Show this
weekend.

P-mail me if your interested...........

&gt; I've had the same problem for a few years.  I even rebuilt what was a
&gt; relatively
&gt; low time carburetor.  I still think it is a carburation problem, but I
don't
&gt; know what. I have to stand on the gas pedal while cranking or it won't
&gt; start.
&gt; And, like you, I've never been stranded as it always starts.  I've
&gt; considered
&gt; replacing the carburetor, but haven't quite made up my mind.

&gt; &gt; The bus will start
&gt; &gt; just fine when it is cold, but once the engine is warm, and I've been
&gt; &gt; driving for a while, it is hard to start when I turn it offf. This makes
&gt; it
&gt; &gt; very difficult (and kinda embarassing) to fill up on gas, stop at the
post
&gt; &gt; office, etc.  The negine cranks over fine, but doesn't fire right up
like
&gt; it
&gt; &gt; does when cold.  Eventually, it will always start though, I've never
been
&gt; &gt; stranded because of this.
