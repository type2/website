Subject: Re: [T2] Acceptable speeds

Hi Bryan,
	I too have a '70 bus.  You may have seen the thread I started a few days 
ago on welding fabrication.  I am planning a VR6 install into my bus.  It'll 
cost a few thousand bucks by the time it's complete, but I think that's 
pretty cheap for 170+ reliable, genuine VW horsepower.  It should cost about 
the same as a quality Type IV upgrade.  I ordered a brand-new VW beam from 
Bus Depot, and I'll be adding disc brakes to her as well.  All the 
amenities(AC included) in my old classic.  Isn't that what we're all 
after(aside from the ability to haul jet-skis up a steep grade at 75 MPH)?  
Happy tweaking, no matter which route you choose!

'71 Westy(hibernating for the decade)
