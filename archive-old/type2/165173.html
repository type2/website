Subject: Re: [T2] Subject: Re: [T2] 73 Bus - Paint Job Recommendations?

This is really nothing new.

Model Ts and horse drawn coaches were painted with a brush and a paint
called Japan.

Paint, dry, sand, paint, dry, sand, until there is enough film build up
to wet sand and buff.

I believe the Japan was a lacquer based paint.

Now--the problem with this Tremclad enamel is --leave the car in the
garage.
Do not allow the UV to ever hit it.
It'll chaulk out faster than you can blink your eye's.

Without any hardener in it--there is no UV top barrier to prevent the
paints break down to chaulking.

It's a bunch of work for a short lived paint job.
