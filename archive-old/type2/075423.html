Subject: Re: [T2] Sunroof solutions for former poptop campers??

Hi John,
Sorry  about  the  delay. 
I only got the magazine back last night.
The  guys you want to contact  are a firm in Essex
called Paris Beetles.
Contact Ricky at Paris Beetles on 01277 823365.
This is  a  English number so  you guys will probably
have a 4 or 5 digit international code to go with it.
They not only make custom watertight fabric sunroofs,
but provide one of the few non-factory watertight
cabrio conversions for Beetles according to UK mag,
VolksWorld.
They probably have a website but it's not listed in
the magazine article so try  searching under &quot;Paris
Beetles,Essex,UK&quot; for possible solutions.
Happy hunting!
:-)
Cheers 
Andrew Wood

&gt; Andrew - can you post the information on the company
&gt; in England? 
&gt; 
&gt; There's a company here that makes aftermarket
&gt; ragtops,
&gt; but I can't say I'd recommend them, since the two
&gt; installations I've seen sag badly.
