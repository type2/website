Subject: 70bus with type III engine

I just purchased a 70 Type II with a an engine # U0470098. Bus is in
good shape but engine is not running. Should I be surprised to find this
engine #. I'm planning to drop the engine this weekend. The previous
owners description of the short time he drove the bus leads me to
believe the main or rod bearings are gone. (severe vibration) I am an MG
midget person (1970, 74 and 76) but always wanted a bus. I would
appreciate any responses.

Thanks,
Steve
