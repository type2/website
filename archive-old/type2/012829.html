Subject: shifter for 72 only bus
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

if the shifter on a 72 bus suddenely stops shifting
what might be the problem? it's connected at the front
and also at the back, the coupler is intact and the
part that connects the rear shift arm to the gearbox
is connected.it sounds like a noise in the tube that
is welded between the front and back where the
shifting arm goes through.any ideas????? thanks chad
