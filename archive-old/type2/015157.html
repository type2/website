Here's some info on a couple of &quot;Campers&quot; that came up locally
(Aspen, CO):

1.  1974 Westy, 69k miles (really!), new 3 window canvas, new brakes
and carbs.  Repainted white (was green).  Little rust.  Some owner
mods to sink/cabinets but owner reports ready to drive/camp anywhere
condition.  CALL BRUCE AT 970-379-6048. Asking $4500 OBO.

2.  1977 Hardtop &quot;Camper&quot;  Westy cabinets, folder-bed etc. (no pop-top).
Repainted white, has a few rust spots.  5k on VW (factory rebuilt) 2-liter
FI motor.  150k on speedo, green plaid interior. CALL ROB AT 970-925-6278.
Asking $2000 OBO.  

Don't know these folks nor have I seen the busses but I did talk to both
on the phone briefly.  Caveat Emptor, YMMV, etc.
