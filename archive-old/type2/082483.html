Subject: Re: [T2] Help, 1970 Crew Cab Trade..... 

G'day Hart,
Mmmm, let me see...Crewcab, Ghia, Crewcab, Ghia.....
Gee, why don't you just choose whether to poke out you
left eye or your right eye :-)
Being bus minded I'd have to go Crew Cab but that
secret yearning for a slammed Ghia is crying from my
subconcious.
Can't you afford both??
:-)
Cheers

&gt; Greetings Bus list members: I would like to get
&gt; advise on a very subjective question:
&gt; 
&gt; I now own a 67 21 DLX, a 70 Ghia, 73 SB and a 82
&gt; Rabbit Conv. A good friend wants to trade my 70 Ghia
&gt; for his 1970 Crew Cab (double cab).  The ghia is all
&gt; new, paint, motor, etc. The 70 Crew cab is all
&gt; original, paint, motor, etc. The body is cherry, no
&gt; dents, no rust (desert T2), motor runs
&gt; strong.....just everything is 1970, its a true cream
&gt; puff. Should I? Any thoughts on the 1970 crew model?
&gt; How are parts availability for this model?
&gt; 
&gt; What to do? 
&gt; 
&gt; Hart
&gt;
