Subject: 12v T2 wiper motor needed... (Help!)

A friend is looking for a 12v wiper motor and mechanism with switch and
mini-wire harness for his splittie bus project. He would prefer the two
speed item model part number 211955113GA. The 2-speed switch is also desired. 
VanBondo and the '67 RFH and the '57 single cab already have them. I don't
need it for myself or the &quot;stash pile.&quot; The finshing touches on the '67 RFH
has me broke big time right now...

Can anybody help out with a tested, bonified working set up?
What is a current &quot;fair&quot; price for:
The 12v motor (single or dual speed), or a motor with complete mechanism,
and/or either with a working switch? The associated mini-wiring harness
would be nice as well.
Was there a 12V single speed motor and or switch?

Also can just the wiper shafts for the 66-67 type of wiper mechanism be
purchased any where? If so, where?, what cost?, and what is the part number
if you know.

Sorry to bleed your brains...
