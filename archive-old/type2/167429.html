Subject: Weber Progressive advice required.

Hi Volks,

Imagine the horror.  Me, the cheerleader of L-Jetronic and proponent  
of MegaSquirt.... Suddenly I am forced to deal with a weber  
progressive in the family fleet.

See, my Dad bought a 1975 westy (&quot;Franklin&quot;) about 5 years ago and in  
order to get it mobile ASAP we threw in a turnkey engine acquired  
last year at John Brown's Buses. It came equipped with a dual-vac  
distributor with no vac lines attached. That distributor had to be  
replaced as the lobe was severely rusted (engine had been sitting  
outside for a year or so). We are now using a dual-vac distributor  
from a 1975 FI bus.

I am wondering about the correct timing spec for this carb/dizzy  
combo, if there is one. I have been aiming for 7.5 BTDC but I can't  
seem to get the rpms stable at that point as soon as the rpms change  
the timing goes with it. If the rpms drop, the timing drops too. If  
the rpms go up, the timing advances. It just doesn't want to stay  
stable at 7.5.

We're looking to get this thing mobile so I can test-drive it locally  
for a few days before my brother attempts the 4-hour trip to  
BusFusion next weekend. Help in getting this carb sorted out would be  
greatly appreciated.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
