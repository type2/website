&gt; Dear Perry,
&gt; 
&gt; 2.0L heads tend to be in short supply. Good ones in even shorter
supply.
&gt; You might consider using 1800cc heads instead. They will fit on a
2.0L 
&gt; engine with no modifications. You lose a bit of displacement...

AFAIK, swapping heads won't change your displacement, which is
determined by the cylinders and crankshaft.  It can change your
compression ratio and your valve size, however, which will affect power.
