Subject: Re: [T2] broken oil strainer bolt?

Chris said:

If this is what it sounds like, where the bottom part of the case has to
 be replaced, what all am I looking at having done anyway and guesses as to the cost involved?

 im guessing it's not as costly as a rebuild, but labor-wise its probably
 getting pretty close.

 *fingers crossed and I don't even know why*

Um, I am confused here.

There is no 'lower part' of the case to be replaced. Your engine case has a left half and a right half,
matched as a case.

Other than seeing how bad the damage to the case itself is and maybe a temporary repair until you get another
case or engine assembly, there is no such thing as 'replacing the bottom of the case'.
