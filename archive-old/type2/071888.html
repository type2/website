I have a bunch of Mercedes Benz aluminum wheels from 14 inch to 16 inch.  All of them are the same bolt pattern as my 76 bus, but the studs are to short.  I have only been able to fit one pair of steel wheels without any problems.  It seems as if the two screws on the rear drums keep the wheel from mounitng flat...  Any help would be greatly appreciated,,,,  it will look awesome........
