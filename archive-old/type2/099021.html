Subject: Re: [T2] 75 FI bus won't start-still won't!

Sorry, Karl, I was working from memory- I followed VW's AFC
troublestooting manual (1976)-
Today I rechecked the temp sensor, which gave no reading (acted shorted-
no one commented on the 500 ohms I got yesterday at room temperature),
so I put in a resistor between ground and the sensor wire, set around
2000 ohms.  Since I was alone, I wanted to do the cold start valve test
involving building up fuel pressure and applying power to the valve and
see if pressure drops (that valve has an impossible to reach screw under
it)..  However, pressure in ring main would not build up (no reading by
the time I got back to engine), so I found someone to run the starter-
pressure built to 40 in 4 seconds, but dropped quite rapidly after key
off- this could be pressure regulator or fuel pump valve (the latter did
drip when I ran the output into a jar, or is that normal?)
    Did other tests as per manual- juice is getting to center terminal
of resistor pak; each lead out of pak has 2.5 ohms resistance, same as
the spare pak.  So moving on, checked trigger impulse wire- it is
continuous to MPC terminal 1, and yesterday it did glow a test light
when checked terminal 1 to ground.  This led to checking the ground on
the control unit, ign on- yes, terminal 10 is live and glows test light
across to term. 5, 16, `17.  This led to swapping the control unit,
which did not help!
   I checked the resistance across every injector; coil is continuous.
Next I'll try verifying continuity from each wire out of the series
resistor to the injector plug- but which of the 2 connector terminals do
you use (left or right as you stare at the  injector, tip facing away
from you?   I'm still confused as to what actually causes the triggering
of the injector coil- I thought it is supposed to get a continuous 12v
and ground is triggered by control unit??  
Other checks- double relay checks out as to live terminals and it clicks
when ignition is turned on.
