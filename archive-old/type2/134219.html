&lt;However, lotsa people have their vacuum
 hooked up wrong.&gt;


Amen to that! In all the years I've been messing with these VW engines, 
almost every time I open someone's hood to  look at their engine, they have 
the damn vacuum hoses hooked up wrong. I try to explain it to them but their 
stubborness kicks in and they are sure they're right. This is why I always 
recommend setting timing with a timing light- if the distributor isn't even 
advancing, it should be obvious that they have it hooked up wrong. They 
usually have the retard hooked up backwards, so the timing must actually be 
retarding when they rev their engine. However, most of the people I run into 
don't use timing lights. Oh well, it's your engine.

As for the dreaded 009, I have one good thing to say about it- no vacuum 
hoses to screw up.
