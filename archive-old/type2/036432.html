Subject: Re: Towing with a bus

I tow a small trailer behind my 79 manual sportsmobile bus.  (some on the 
list have seen it.)
its a little one wheel job that my grandfather made back in the mid 80s.  the 
one wheel swivels and the trailer itself bolts right to the back bumper one 
on each side under each tail light.  i would guess that it weighes about 
500-600 lbs loaded when traveling.  its been bolted on the back of the bus 
for the last 75,000 miles or so.  no problems yet.  (just knocked on wood)  
but then again i really baby her.   not to mention 2 adults 4 kids and 3 dogs 
in the bus.
