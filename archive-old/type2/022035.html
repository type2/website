Well, as it turns out the guy was wrong again! It IS INDEED an Adventurewagen
top on an '82 Westy. I originally wasn't interested in this style recalling a
conversion I had seen on an '87 syncro Adventurewagen. But, this one is
different than the one I saw! I got the pictures today and I am totally
psyched about getting it...So Anyone w/ pictures of their Adventurewagens or
knowledge of web sites w/ pictures please E- me and let me know. I'd love to
compare them to mine, these pictures are polaroids taken at night so the
quality is marginal. I'd love to hear any and all stories, likes, dislikes,
prob's, etc...  Plus any additional info on various styles, accessories,
etc... It even came w/ the original sales ticket from Adventurewagen!!!
TIA
	MM
