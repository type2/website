&gt; &gt; Hi Listees;
&gt; &gt;    Art Lynch here in Texas attempting (yet) another long distance rescue
&gt; &gt; of Nikki Elko.
&gt; 
&gt; she has about the worst luck of any VW owner I know.  

No kiddin. but This doesn't look good for Kelly. I could have sworn
that he sold her the good karma bus nose &amp; not the still break down
nose. :) Just in case anyone is out there but lazy, make youself get
up &amp; make the drive to help her. It will be well worth the
conversation you get from her.
