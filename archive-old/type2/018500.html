      You don't need a lawyer to take him to small claims court. Make the check
good, that absolves you of any legal problem. Then just file a suit in small
claims court. All you have to do is tell your story to the judge -- they are very
used to hearing complaints from people getting screwed by crooked business
people, and you'll probably have no problem winning a judgement against the shop.
In fact, just filing the suit will probably scare the guy enough to get your
money back.  It only costs a little bit to file the suit, like $50.
