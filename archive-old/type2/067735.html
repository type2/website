Subject: Vendors on the list

&gt;Ken, you had at one point mentioned that you were going to set up a web
&gt;page with experiences dealing with different vendors.  Is this plan still
&gt;in the works?

Hell, I'm still working on threading the digests (333 and counting).

I still want to do it, I think it would be a way excellent service to the
VW community. Except, you know what? All I can remember is a long thread
excoriating GEX, and of course the ongoing kvetching about the Bus Boys
catalog. There may be more in here, I'm not done threading yet, earlier
issues last.

Somebody posted vaguely about problems with Mark Stephens not long ago, but
he wouldn't put the details up in public. Litigious society. Our loss, no
gain.

Not that I want you to go out of your way to flame vendors, whether they're
on the list or not. We expect a certain consideration for the sake of
propriety no matter who we are. My take is that as long as the account is
factual, and you don't go out of your way to harm a man's business, you're
probably okay. But I ain't a lawyer.

At any rate if there aren't but two or three threads about vendors I'll
just leave them in the general archive. It's up to you all, not me.
