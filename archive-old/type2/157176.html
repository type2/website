Subject: Re: [T2] Brake/Idle relationship - how bizarre...

&gt;&gt; All seemed fine, but we noticed that when we put
the
brake on hard (even while standing still in neutral)
the idle drops downto the point of killing it.  We
checked to make sure that the throttle cable was not
being interfered with and for the life of me can't see
the relationship between the two.  &lt;&lt;

Actually, there is a DIRECT relationship between the
two in a 71.  71's have a power brake booster which is
operated from a vacuum port on the intake manifold. 
If you have a bad or leaky brake booster, then
pressing the brakes can cause the symptons you
describe because in effect, you are creating a big
vaccum leak when the brakes are pushed if the booster
is bad.  Find the big rubber hose that is attached to
the intake manifold (probably to the left in the
engine compartment). Follow that hose under the bus
all the way to the front of the bus, right under the
drivers seat and you will see where it connects to the
booster. Check for leaks all along the hose and at the
booster itself.
