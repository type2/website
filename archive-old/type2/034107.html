Subject: heat risers - pers exp

Having just done this, I can tell you what did and didn't work for me.

Tried to feed several different types of cable - clutch, ebrake, gas - in
there to munch the carbon. Wear goggles and leather welding gloves!!!  This
worked to an extent, but won't really get the job done. What it DID work
wonders for was polishing out the rust AFTER I cleaned out the carbon.
Next, I filled the risers w/ several different types of solvent... brake
cleaner, wd-40, etcetc. Let em sit a while, than banged on the riser with a
smaell hammer. Then I put a propane torch to it - THAT got some action!
Obviously all the volitailes burned off quickly, but they got the carbon
burning quickly as well. If you've ever smelled a coal fire, you'll know
when the carbon is going :P
You need to prop the propane torch in such a way that it continuously
impinges one spot on the riser in order to keep the heat up. Just waving it
around won't work.  I have been told that feeding an oxy-acy flame down the
riser mouth will do this faster, but don't have one. BTW, just pointing a
propane flame into the riser won't work.  Every so often, pick it up w/ the
welding gloves and make it ring with a hammer. Don't bend it, but knock it
around pretty good. This will loosen mucho crap.
I also feed compressed air down there, which helps keep the carbon aflame.
I let it cool a bit, then blew water thru it. After about 2 hours of this,I
had a FAIRLY clear heat riser. Too bad it was a 6volt manifold, and
wouldn't clear my generator :P :P! Measure ONCE, cut TWICE I guess.

BAck to the manifold pile... THIS time, I decided to get medieval on it. I
drilled out a 1/4&quot; hole on the outside of one leg, where it transitioned
from vertical to horizontal. I then took some thick copper welding wire and
mashed it into the hole again and again, until I could see it come out the
other side. THEN I put a clutch cable in there and spun the rest of the
goop out. My buddy brazed the hole shut for me (and when I was blowing thru
the riser, said &quot;that would make a good shofar (ceremonial horn), but yer
getting ashes all over your face, and that's a different religion!&quot;); next
time, I would put a threaded plug in there so's I can simply unscrew it to
do this again...

FWIW, i have been told that in the summer you can block off the riser
(simply insert tin can piece on the right inbetween muffler and riser
instead of the gasket w/ a hole) and gain a few HP, but if you live in cold
climes, don't forget to change it back come winter. Don't know why, but
plugged riseres make rod knock.......
