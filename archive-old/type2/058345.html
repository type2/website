I think I have the answer....

These are the C****** European engine codes used in aircooled Bays/Vanagons:

Bay Window:
CA     1700cc     66 bhp
CB     1700cc     66 bhp
CD     1700cc     66 bhp auto, not UK
CJ     2000cc     70 bhp carburettors

Vanagon:
CT,CZ  1600cc     37 kW aircooled (79-82?)
CV,CU  2000cc     51 kW aircooled (79-82?)

Wedges in UK came with the option of a 1600cc aircooled as well as 2 litre, before
they all went to water-boxer configuration in 1982.

So, it could be CT or perhaps CJ but with a big horizontal scratch on the fanhousing?
There's 2 locations for the engine number on a 'Type 4' engine - on the fanhousing
(detachable) and on the case itself, just behind the oil breather box (when I say
behind, that's WRT the whole van).

[It has a serial number that begins with CT.]

[1. Has anyone any idea what this motor could be with a serial number
beginning with CT.]
