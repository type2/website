Subject: brake drums

What size is the nut on the end of the rear wheel on my 78?  It's the 
funky one with the pin through it.  WIll the drum come off with the aid 
of a bead blow hammer, or do i need a puller?  Duroshark do you have a 
drum puller by chance?

I replaced the front rotors and pads this weekend.  Once I got the 
calipers broke free it was a very easy job.  Whomever put the last pads 
on put the plate that goes behind the pads on wrong.  I was able to bend 
the teeth out a little and installed them properly.  What do they keep 
the piston from doing?  Turning?  Also for future reference (and when I 
don't need to replace the rotors) what tool do i use to depress the 
pistons to get he new pads in.  This time I used a large C clamp and the 
old pad.

As always thanks type2 list members!
