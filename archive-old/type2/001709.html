     Well, I got my bus home.  I found two things.  I found the Pertronix
igniter plate had moved too close to the magnets.  Not sure if that would
keep it from starting,  but I also found the cylinder head temp sensor wire
disconnected.  I am not sure what stopped the van but it seems to be running
fine after I re-adjusted the igniter &amp; re-connected the head sensor.  I have
learned a lesson from this.  When I was young, I never went anywhere without
my tools ala Muir.  As I have gotten older, I have also had gotten a little
lazy.  My toolbox stays with me now.
