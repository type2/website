Yikes! The only thing I can think of is have the motor rebuilt, have someone 
qualified go through the bus and check everything else out. You probably are 
due some money back, however, by signing an &quot;as-is&quot; bill of sale , in most 
states that means absolutely no warranty.As far as I'm concerned, there's no 
such thing as a bus for sale that'll need no work. Remember, it's a 30 year 
old vehicle. By paying close to what he wanted, this also unfortunately 
contributes to the rising prices of busses.Good luck, and hopefully you'll 
get years of enjoyment  out of your $7600 dollar bus.  Ed
