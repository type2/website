Subject: Re: [T2] I think I've made my bus worse...

&gt; I advanced the timing (guessing about 5 deg) and it started trying to start.
&gt; I was on the right track! I tweaked it back and forth a few times and got it
&gt; to start and rev up. Once. See, it backfired and died. After that I can't
&gt; get it to even try to start. I went and checked all the vacuum connections
&gt; again in case the backfire blew one off. Nothing.

don
maybe you got the plug wires positioned wrong on the dizzy cap.

with the engine off. tdc at the firing position for cyl #1. (both valves
on #1 will be closed)
Make sure that the rotor is pointing to the wire for #1.
Then make sure the wires  clockwise around the cap are 1432.

If this does turn out to be the case dont feel dumb. Ive done it more than
a few times.
