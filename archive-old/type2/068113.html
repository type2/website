Jeff,
I believe the &quot;rivet&quot; to which you refer is actually a type of solder which has
a specific melting point, thereby acting as an overload protection device. Did
you notice there was a gap between the the two places that were supposed to be
making contact? They're spring loaded so they separate when the solder melts,
opening the circut. Cheap fuse. In every single non operating clock of this type
I've repaired this has been the problem. Unabe to determine the melting temp. of
the solder, I have resorted to painting the area to be resoldered with a little
rosin and melting what's left of the existing solder and soldering the two
pieces of metel together with that. Maintains the &quot;original&quot; fuse protection.
Saves lots of money on solder, too  ;-)
Take note, guys. Go ahead and open up those non-workong clocks. They're less
mysterious than you think. 

&gt;This reminded me of one of my first experiences with a VW.
&gt;My '67 Sqbk's clock (analog, electromagnetically driven spring type) 
&gt;wasn't working.  Having heard that VW clocks were nortorious for not 
&gt;working, I was bound and determined to get mine working.  After 
&gt;playing for awhile, I attached live wires to it and started poking 
&gt;and prodding with a screwdriver.  Eventually I made contact and BAM, 
&gt;tick tock for 5 minutes.  A real heart stopper, to have a clock SLAM 
&gt;back to life.  Then it stopped, more prodding, BAM tick tock for 5 
&gt;minutes. After about an hour of this I finally found a spot where a 
&gt;rivet had fallen out.  Unplugging clock, I wrapped some 
&gt;copper wire though rivet holes and it still lives 20 years later.
