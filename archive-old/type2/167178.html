Subject: dimensions needed (fuel tank area)

Can someone wonder out to one of the disassembled VW busses (68-79), and 
give me... or make me a sketch of the fuel tank area (without the fuel tank 
in it).

I want to build (or buy) a larger fuel tank and install it in there. Once 
you pull the cover the original fuel tank looks line a pea on a catchers 
mit.

A picture or sketch with dimensions would be the best.
