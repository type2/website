Subject: Re: [T2] Engine install assistance please

Did not realize I could do that! I imagine that the trans. pivots on the front
mount? Sounds like so much more clearance for aligning the engine to input shaft.
Is there any alignment concerns with getting the trans. back in exactly the same
place?
Thanks Karl! This sounds like a great idea. Might be two weeks before I can try it
though, weatherman predicts snow for the weekend in Northern Arizona : (

&gt; Did you remove the 2 upper transmission mount bolts? They go in from the front,
&gt; above the trans. 15mm headed bolts. The only bolts on the bus that you need a
&gt; 15mm socket for. Remove those. Then the trans will swing down and you can slide
&gt; the complete engine in.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Today I discovered how much you can forget in a years time. Its been
&gt; &gt; about a year since I removed the engine from my 75 bus. I took notes as
&gt; &gt; things came apart but unfortunately the notes are nowhere to be found.:
&gt; &gt; ( Today was going to be the day to install my new engine. The first
&gt; &gt; problem I ran into wa the bearer bar. Forgot to bolt it to the motor
&gt; &gt; mounts before installing the exhaust. Found out the hard way that the
&gt; &gt; bar can be installed by removing the passenger side heat exchanger and
&gt; &gt; raising the engine about a foot off the ground. Problem solved.
&gt; &gt; Proceeded to try installing the engine with all the sheet metal on.
&gt; &gt; Mistake number 2. After 2 tries I gave up because it was too cold and I
&gt; &gt; was too frustrated to do a good job of it. While cleaning up my tools so
&gt; &gt; I can find everything next weekend I remembered that when the engine
&gt; &gt; came out I had to remove the tin from the rear of the engine. This was
&gt; &gt; the only way to get that last 1/4 inch of clearance to get the lower
&gt; &gt; engine to trans. studs to clear the holes in the bell housing. Hopefully
&gt; &gt; this is the key to getting it back in?
