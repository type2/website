&gt; VW batteries as all know are
&gt;notoriously low quality.  The old black cased ones used till '88 or so
&gt;were actually quite OK, my '86 Quantum was fine on the origional in
&gt;'94.  Conversely the clear cased '86 van battery lasted 1 year, was
&gt;warranty
&gt;replaced, lasted 2 years, then got a generic.  The '89 Jetta, '90
&gt;Passat, '90 Corrado, and my '85 van batteries had all lasted under
&gt;2.5 years.  All were replaced with regular parts store batteries
&gt;(varying makes but only one or 2 battery manufactures anyway, Exide
&gt;and a few others) and lasted until we saw em go.  I know as a fact
&gt;though both the '86 Van and '90 Passat batteries were replaced under
&gt;the 2/24000 warranty.

Wow! The battery in my Tercel lasted 11 years, including a 100_year_record
cold winter in its 10th year. I mean we're talking -30 degress is not uncommon.
I always figure on 5-7 years for a battery.

What size are the screws that hold the bottom engine tin?
