OK, I'll bite!  How often will a 90A (or even 45A) alternator truly see
full load?  90A at 13V is 1170W, and unless you plan to heat the bus
electrically I don't see any way to use this much power.  Unless you plan
on installing a pirate radio station and driving it around the country I
doubt that you'll use the amps!

The real reason for high capacity alternators is to ensure rapid recharge
of the battery on vehicles that get a lot of short trips (fire, ambulance,
military) and tend to have a number of accessories that draw power while
the engine is off.
