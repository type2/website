Subject: tr: [T2] EGR....optional??

I talked to a guy who has worked on bugs and transporters for a while and he

work that well anyway.  Has anyone ever done this, or am I the only knucklehead
to do it?  What could the possible repurcussions be?

Hey there Volks,

Repurcussions ?? *If* you ever sell your bus, and it doesn't have *any* of the
EGR stuff, the new owner might refer to you as a DPO (dreaded previous owner)
:D

While the EGR system on my bus isn't complete, I wouldn't do away with the
whole system starting at the throttle. I don't have the EGR filter on my bus
(PO took care of that), and I'm running a 72-74 stock style muffler (no
provision for the EGR) on my 79. My system is plugged where the EGR filter
would hook up.

In the course of putting my engine back in my bus I plan to keep all the egr
stuff on the top side of the engine so that it looks like it's stock and has a
EGR system. MA doesn't require emission inspections on vehicles older the 15
yrs currently (but who knows if that'll change). If I move to another state or
sell my bus, it'll still have most of the EGR stuff so that it *could* be
hooked up correctly (just need the egr filter and correct exhaust).

Putting the egr parts you remove in a box, and saving them isn't a great idea
either as these things tend to get lost (AMHIK). They all end up the same place
that missing camping stools and childs cots are (in the DPO's garage probably)
:)

Just my opinion...
