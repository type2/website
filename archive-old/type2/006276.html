&gt; You have given me answers to several questions, but
&gt; perhaps you can tell me why you never bothered to reply to the one below.

Maybe because I never received it???

And if I did, would I be obligated to answer it? I am not 'on-call' to answer
all technical questions. I am not in business to sell parts here. I just try to
help people. Sure, I darn near give away parts but I don't advertise or
immediately reply to the list that 'I have that part for the inflated price
of.....'. If I have a needed part or know of one I can get right away, I pmail
the person looking for it.

This was a fun hobby but it has turned brown real fast......

&gt; Neither did Bus Depot after several calls on my dime and a promise that
&gt; someone would get back to me. Joe sounds to me not as you describe him (it
&gt; would offend me to quote you) but more a person who decided to apply his
&gt; knowlege and skills towards starting his own business. *Your* attitude seems
&gt; to be that of  a crochety old mechanic who wishes he had done the same.

Sorry buddy, but you are wrong. I did own my own repair business for 4 years. I
learned a few things from it.
1) you can't run a business from a creeper under a car
2) you only have to work a half a day each day, either the 1st 12 hours or the
2nd 12 hours
3) you will get ulcers when you are 28
4) somebody with money will buy the property out fom under you and put you out
of business [Andy Granatelli in this case]


&gt;I applaud Joe's tempered response to you.

That is your opinion and no matter how you applaud it, a E switch will not work
correctly in a 71/72 bus. It may be VW's substitution for the PLAIN switch but
it is and will always be a BAD sub. That was the point I was trying to make but
a 'tempered response' does not change the fact that he could at least say ''The
E will work in a 71/72 except it is missing circuit 57 and the green park light
indicater will not light up''.

&gt; &gt; Thanks Karl. Bus Depot offers a Drive Flange Grease Cap, part # 002 517
&gt; &gt; 289A, 68-79 bus. Would you know if this is the part that may need
&gt; replacing?
