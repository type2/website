Subject: hoses?

Since my rebuild my '77 westy (2L FI engine) has been starting hard.  I
labeled every hose and wire well but two small hoses failed to get marked
and I believe they might be part of the hard starting problem.  I found what
seemed to be correct locations for them but I could be wrong.  I know what
you are thinking, &quot;just switch the hoses around&quot;.  Well I can't remember where
one of them is.  So here's were you folks come in.  On my '77 westy there is
a metal (goldish color) disk attached to the &quot;firewall&quot; just to the lower
right of the carbon filter box thing.  It has at least one small hose attacted
to it maybe two.  I believe the thing may be a pressure regulator or something.
Does anyone know where the hoses to that are suppose to go to/ come from?
Also, when I removed it I was unable to get the gold disk to sit horizontal 
upon installation.  Does anyone know if this matters to the operation of this
&quot;thing&quot;.
Any help/information greatly appreciated,
thanks
brett
