Subject: Tranny Removal

Folks,

Okay, I'm thinking about removing my transmission myself.  For some that
might not be a big deal; for me it might be a major undertaking.  I have the
Bentley book.  Can anyone out there give me a more simple set of
instructions?  Do I have to remove the engine and tranny to remove the
transmission?

Thanks,
