I use 195/75R14s myself.  I cannot say if the 185 vs the 195 will make a
noticable difference.  Some 195/74R14s are smaller then others.  The
Bridgestone 603v has a narrower tread then the Yokohama 370 (NLA) did in
the same size.  It's also narrower then the old 195 (PO installed)
Michelins (MX's if i recall?) that were on the Vanagon.


&gt; #1.  IS THIS TRUE? &quot;There isn't any good argument for spending $109 for the
&gt; Agilis, when the $50 Continental will do almost same thing for the vehicle.&quot;

Probably.  I do know that both Contis and Michelins have a very mixed
reputation.

&gt; #2.  I AM UNCERTAIN ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS PIECE OF DATA: The
&gt; Yokohama 356D shows a measured tire width of 5 inches, and all the other
&gt; brands show a 5.5 measured tire width. Is this significant?

Not really....though I'd recommend against the 356 if you plan on driving
in the rain.  Everyone I know of who's used these have had problems with
low traction in the wet.

The Bridgestone, which has a similar tread, is great in the rain. (I'm on
my first set with a dozen+ thousand miles on'm, plus a set on my moms
vanagon.)

If you plan to spend any amount of time OFF pavement, the 603v (and I
suspect the 356) is NOT the way to go.  They have virtually zero traction
in sand, grass, mud, gravel.  (Compared to my prior sets of Yoko 370s, as
well as some generic mixed passenger tires before those. (PO installed)

&gt; #3.  IS THIS TRUE? &quot;All the above listed tires will fit my steel 5.5 x 14
&gt; H1 ET39 original rims and will meet the MINIMUM load-bearing requirements
&gt; for the vehicle.&quot; I can't go wrong safety-wise buying any of the above

Pretty much, yeah.

&gt; #4   IS THIS TRUE? &quot;All of the above tires have reinforced sidewalls that
&gt; will stabilize the vehicle in cross winds and truck-passings, and in
&gt; emergency maneuvers, compared to non-reinforced passenger car tires. They

Yup, though I cannot say for the Dunlop.  The last Dunlop I looked at was
a mild offroad tread and was at the low-end of the C ratings...I dont
recall what tire that was though, as it was a few years ago.

&gt; #5   IS THIS TRUE? &quot;None of the above tires will make the vehicle ride so
&gt; stiffly that even the most  stoical and enduring passenger would say the

If you run the stock air pressures for your vehicle, you should be fine.

&gt; Are the Yokohama's a slightly better choice than the Continentals? They
&gt; cost slightly more and are rated in a different manner, so it is hard to
&gt; compare them.

If my choice was between the two, I'd take my chances with the Contis.

.....david (still missing the 370s. those were good tires.)
