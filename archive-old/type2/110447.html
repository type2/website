&lt;&lt; Rent the big truck and stick the bus inside...

BTDT, with a Beetle from upstate NY to Tenn. U-Haul was out of the size
truck we were interested in and rented us the Big Mother at the same
rate. We were gonna do the U-Haul one way to Tenn. and tow the Beetle
for the ride back...But we saw all that room in the truck and just bolted
a few eyebolts through the floor and strapped it down...Beep. Beep... 8-)
