&gt; I found a very nice straight body, good paint, whole interiored 77 Westy
&gt; last night for $2300.00 !!  BUT the automatic transmission is shot.


If you're reasonably near the Philadelphia area, I do have a '79 auto trans,
in working condition, still in the Westy.  $175, you remove.  Will not ship.
