Subject: Re: [T2] 12 volt fan for sleeping area?

In a message dated 3/31/03 2:00:44 PM, paullist_at_guzyk_dot_com writes:

&lt;&lt; Can someone recommend a nice 12 volt fan (or pair of fans) that could 
be mounted/clipped to the ceiling to cool my wife and I as we sleep 
(on the fold out bed, not the cot)  Opening the louvered windows and 
rear hatch (with screen) doesn't cool us enough.  Also, the fan(s) 
could help blow away the mozzies that sneak into the bus each night. 
Does an oscillating type of 12v fan exist?
 &gt;&gt;

Check out the fans from either computers/electronic equipment,
some are 12V. I have a pair mounted on my dash to demist the 
top of the windshield (sorta...). If you're tall like me, you'll under-
stand the view thru the top of the windshield...
