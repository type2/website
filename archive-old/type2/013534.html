Hello Listers:

I know we've discussed oil till we're blue in the face, but I heard something today that I've never heard of, or thought of myself.  One of the counter guys at a well-respected VW repair shop in the San Jose area told me that he's had great success using a 50/50 mixture of Redline synthetic oil and regular old Dino oil.  Apparently, some VW engines won't leak with regular oil, but will leak if you use synthetic (I don't know why, but I've heard many people say this).  Synthetic oils have some performance advantages over regular oil, such as more stable viscosity, no thermal breakdown, etc...  But if it leaks out of your engine, it's kind of expensive.  It seems that mixing the 2 different kinds of oil gives the performance advantages of synthetic, without the leaking problems.

Has anyone out there done this themselves, and have you used oils other than Redline?  It seems to me that it shouldn't matter what brands are used, but it would be nice to hear of personal experiences.
