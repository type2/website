&gt; No--you remove the upper with it attached to the pipe by disconnecting
&gt; the lower and bringing it down and out the round hole. You already have
&gt; the gas tank panel removed? If no, remove it. You already have the fuel
&gt; injection ecu removed? If no, remove it. You already have the black,
&gt; round cover on the right side wall removed? If no, remove it. You
&gt; already have the screws and plate on the outer body removed and you
&gt; rolled in the rubber lip? Gotta do that too.

Yah, I've got the gas tank access, the round plate access,
the computer and the gas cap retaining ring out.

OK, now, reinstalling it.  Will the new rubber flange that goes 
to the filler cap go back out through the hole with out tearing it
up?

Thanks! 

Mark
