Subject: when I make a left turn and step on the brake, the turn signal
  goes all wacky.

Marc,
    In a post to the type2 list you said........&quot; Now here's the weird
one - when I make a left turn and step on the brake, the turn signal
goes all wacky.  It either slows down or stops.  Never happens when I
make a right turn.  And it's intermitant as well.  Sometimes the left
turn signal works just fine.&quot;

I don't have a wiring schematic to check for your year bus, but let me
suggest something.  If your left brake light and left turn signals
share a common ground it may be bad.  Repair wires and clean
connectors until you are sure the ground is making a good electrical
connection.
