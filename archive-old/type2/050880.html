Subject: Re: [T2] Air Conditioning on 79 Westy

The compressor at the engine compresses the freon which then goes to the
unit under your dash through a component called an evaporator.  Fans blow
through the evaporator which delivers cooled air by letting the freon
expand which absords heat as it expands.  The warm freon then goes to the
underside of your bus to the condenser which removes some of the heat from
the freon before the freon passes back to the compressor to start the
process over.

The old style of compressor used on VW's was the York unit which took about
10HP to turn.  The newer rotary style compressors use about 3HP to turn.
Your system was also an R12 system which has been outlawed and the freon
costs about $40 per pound.  The bus system if I remember correctly used
about 6 pounds.

In order to convert to the newer styles of freon, you would need to change
the compressor, dryer and some O rings.

If you or anyone else does not want to mess with this system, I have been
looking for just the under the dash unit in good shape and would be willing
to purchase it from you.  I would be very greatful to anyone who could sell
me one.  I am trying to get my '76 westy airconditioned for the summer so I
can take my 3 year old on some longer trips.


&gt;Can anyone fill me in on my airconditioning? This has a large compressor? on
&gt;the drivers side of the engine compartment when you open the rear lid, and a
&gt;complex vent system attached under the main dash up front. There are 6 (I
&gt;believe) adjustable vents on this system with a min/off/max knob on the left
&gt;side, and a temp? knob to the right. It does not appear to be working, but
&gt;blows lots of air. :-) I didn't notice a belt to the compressor, how does
&gt;this thing work?
&gt;Thanks
&gt;Courtney
