I think I have it figured out now, thank you all for
your help.  I will ask for more help if I need it. 
Again Thank You All.

&gt; Kevin,
&gt; 	I installed the weber on my '74 with manual
&gt; transmission. 
&gt; Here's the scoop:
&gt; 	Remove old carbs and intake manifolds.
&gt; 	You may or may not have the air pump thing. I did,
&gt; and took 
&gt; it off. There was the problem of three or four tubes
&gt; sticking up out 
&gt; of the heads, next to the intake manifolds. There
&gt; have been 
&gt; discussions about how to plug these on this list,
&gt; and the best way is 
&gt; to get large bolts that screw into them, but not too
&gt; deep! Be sure to 
&gt; use loc-tight.
&gt; 	I remember having to drill a new hole for my
&gt; accelerator 
&gt; cable in the front tin.
&gt; 	And since I had the dual vacuum advance, I needed
&gt; another 
&gt; port on the intake manifold (not sure if you need
&gt; one for the 
&gt; automatic tranny). Some people drill a small hole in
&gt; the intake (with 
&gt; it OFF the bus) and braze/JBWeld a nipple onto it
&gt; for a vacuum hose. 
&gt; I know you aren't supposed to do this, but I tapped
&gt; into the brake 
&gt; booster vacuum hose (instead of puting a nipple on
&gt; the manifold) and 
&gt; haven't had any problems at all.
&gt; 	I think I ended up taking the jets and reversing
&gt; them (taking 
&gt; the jet out of the small venturi and switching it
&gt; with the one in the 
&gt; larger venturi), but I got my carb from Webber and
&gt; since you got 
&gt; yours from the Bus Depot, they  may have your carb
&gt; set up already for 
&gt; you so it runs well.
&gt; 	It took me a while (a week or two) to get it
&gt; running well, 
&gt; but since then, I have had NO problems whatsoever. I
&gt; totally endorse 
&gt; those carbs.
&gt; 	Good luck.
