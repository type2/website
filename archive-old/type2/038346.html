Oh yeah, I forgot about puiing the window felt from the channels. You have
to do that and replace it at the end. I didn't mind this job as much as Sami
but I also did the seals around the vent window which in comparison made
this job seem like a breeze.

&gt; Hello Tim,
&gt;
&gt; I recently replaced the window scraper on one side and hated the job so
much
&gt; I couldn't get myself to doing the other side. You need to strip the door
&gt; *completely*, including glass, vent wing, and even the felt channel. You
&gt; will also find that the aftermarket window scraper is of disappointing
&gt; quality. The chrome trim will be bent from shipping and the scraper is
&gt; actually too short, leaving a 1/2&quot; gap for water to enter! I ended up
&gt; reusing my old chrome trim, drilling out the rivets that hold the old
&gt; scraper and for lack of anything better, riveting on the new --though too
&gt; short-- scraper.
&gt;
&gt; But... I don't think the bad scraper is actually the reason you're getting
&gt; water into the bus; some water will get into the door even with a good
&gt; scraper. What you are probably missing is the plastic foil behind the
&gt; carboard/vinyl panel, which is then tucked into the door to deflect water
&gt; towards the outer skin and away from the cardboard. The water will then
&gt; drain through the drain holes in the bottom of the door (as it is supposed
&gt; to).
