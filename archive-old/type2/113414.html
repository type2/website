I love this blue and white paint job.
It reminds me of a camouflage technique they used in W.W.II for battle ships.
They called it &quot;Clutter&quot; if my memory serves.
They painted the ships with bold geometric patterns to break up the outline 
of the ship so from a distance it was difficult to determine the size and 
direction if a ship.
I have considered a &quot;clutter&quot; paint job just for fun but it sounds like more 
work than fun.
I will be following the comments here as I will be attempting a DIY paint job 
my self.
Cheers,
Rusty
