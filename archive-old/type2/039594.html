Subject: RE: sway away kits

David,

The Sway-Aways come with a new red urethane bushing
that is several times harder than the original (which
is likely rubble by now;-)

I imagine that you *could* buy them seperately, but
they won't work on your stock bar, if that's what
you're thinking. The sway-away (as with other
aftermarket bars) is a larger diameter bar. Mine's
7/8&quot;, which, to my knowledge, is the largest
(stiffest) that is available. I've seen them in 3/4&quot;,
too.

I'm sure the stock type are available *somewhere*, but
I don't know where.


Jaime

&gt; than stock/OEM, are they available separately (for
&gt; replacement if necessary)?
