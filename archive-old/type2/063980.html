76053.1462} Well Texas isn't invisible, but if you measured the state by the number of
76053.1462} trees, the state would be the size of Rhode Island.  (How far is it from Dallas
76053.1462} to San Antonio???  Three six packs)  Big Bend National Park is great but not
76053.1462} really on the way from Az to La.    I've driven across Texas every which way and
76053.1462} there sure is a whole lot of (seems to me) nothing out there.  Now I have family
76053.1462} from Texas, friends in Texas, and Texans have been very very good to me on the
76053.1462} whole  from time to time.  But I can't remember much scenic wonder unless you
76053.1462} are really into big dry open spaces....John Jensen in Annapolis.

Ahhh you've never driven your VW Transporter through East Texas!
Dense forests with as rich biodiversity of flora and fauna as can be found anywhere!
I would classify the river regions as &quot;Wet Forests&quot; and never &quot;Big Dry Open Spaces&quot;.
If you like the woods we have them.

It sounds like you've seen the plains in west Texas.  Been to the Coastal region?  
Texas produces more rice per year than China.
Been to the Valley where we produce more vegetables and fruit than California?
Saying it is &quot;all desert&quot; is like saying Colorado is all mountains, or 
California is all beaches, or alaska is all ice.  

Texas is a big place with lots of geography, and many climates.
We have four full seasons.  It gets in the 10's in the winter,
in the 100's in the summer and beautiful weather in the spring and fall.
Check it out!
