Something over 12V DC should do it.  Usually 20V is the correct setting.
_DON'T_ use the current (Amp) or resistance (Ohm) settings!

Your fuses are arranged something like this:

1. Horn, brake lights, turn signals
2. Windshield wipers, rear window defog switch current
3. High beams, left
4. High beams, right
5. Low beams, left
6. Low beams, right
7. Parking light, right tail light
8. Left tail light
9. Emergency flasher, interior lights
10. Spare

I'd recommend replacing all the fuses with new and making sure that there
is good spring pressure on the fuses before further troubleshooting.
These fuses tend to corrode and make poor connections.
