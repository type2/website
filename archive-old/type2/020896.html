Subject: Re: [T2] 1972 keys

&gt;I recently purchased a 72 Westy and it only came with one set of keys.
&gt;Thinking it was no problem I went to the local key cutting shop and
they
&gt;said they had no blanks for something this old (how dare they!).
&gt;
&gt;You people have any ideas?

I just had 3 copies made for my '72 Westy.  If all else fails, you can
send them to me and I'll get them done here in San Diego.  Cheaper than
RMMW.   But check a few more local places first.  Real locksmiths, not
Home Depot.
