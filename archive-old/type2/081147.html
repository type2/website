Subject: Back from EveryBus

Hello all,
I just got back from EB. My westy is busted so I didnt camp. I cruised up
there from Charlotte around noon in my 71 squareback with my 2 sons.
 I met alot of folks and put some faces to the names on this list. I had
agreat time and my kids had fun also, Sure wish i could have camped though.

-Bryan
