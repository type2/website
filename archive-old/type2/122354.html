Subject: Re: [T2] Gas heater mounting

You are correct, the 8332 mounts on the drivers side of the engine bay, but
don't let that stop you, they also put them in treasure chests on single
cabs and under the seat in double cabs, just look in the factory service
manual.  This heater should not be mounted under the bus because the road
debri that will damage it.

I have seen these mounted behind the drivers seat and they put out a ton of
hot air right there, just make a duct that will push air both front and
back.  Build a sheet metal box to put around the heater and line it with
engine tar board insulation for sound proofing.

Be sure to put in a good exhaust system and seal around the hole in the
floor with exhaust sealant.  Pull fresh air for the combustion chamber
through another hole in the floor so you don't rob oxygen from the passenger
compartment.  Mount your controls on the outside of the box so you can reach
them from the drivers seat.

If you need any SouthWind tune up parts, go to:

Where might I be able to mount a Stewart Warner Model 8332-12 Bus heater??
I am guessing the orig spot was the aux battery tray but I use that.  Any
other good places?  Is it one I could mount under front floorboard?

Thanks in advance,
Snoopy
