Subject: Re: [T2] parts place auto parts

This emporium of VW parts up in Michigan is renowned for bending folks
over one way or another for some time.

It's a Caviet Emptier trip any time you do business with them.---

As is to me means the engine was priorly ripped out of some hulk in
their bone yard.

So in essence I am not suprised at all that the engine was sold as is,
and the core charge should have been expected.
One day the story of the young Melissa, the Pharts Place, and her Westy
should be told agian---

Sad story---


Later,

Terry

Hello All =A0 Has anybody out there dealt with this company before? I
have a customer that bought a new 1.9 diesel motor from them, plus
injection pump and all the parts needed to install in a westy Vanagon.
First thing I see on the invoice is the line saying &quot;as is&quot; Also theres
a core charge on the new engine and pump.Why would this be if they are
new? Just wanting to know! Later and have fun Mark Dearing salem Import
