Subject: Thermostat 

I recently found the cable from the thermostat disconnected from the heater 
flap thingie. I reconnected it but I doesn't seem to be moving the flap 
when the engine gets warm.  The Bentley manual I have doesn't have much 
information on this. 

Is this normal?

How should this work? 

Could I have a bad thermostat? 

What would be the results from having this broken or disconnecxted for 
some period of time? 

Is this a VW only supplied part?
