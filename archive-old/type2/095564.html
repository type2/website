Subject: Pop top

Hey list,

Just wanted to let everyone know, I got my pop-top in from the Bus Depot
(Ron had it drop shipped from his supplier in CA) and it went in great.  I
did have the problem that I've seen others mention here where it didn't
quite fit well enough to fold down the top edge as it says to do in the
instructions, but other than that it's beautiful!  Many, many thanks to Ron
and the guys at the Bus Depot for getting it to me so quick, even though I
was in panic mode and was such a P.I.T.A. about it.  It took about 6.5 hours
with 2 people, (and I would definitely recommend having someone else around
while you're doing it.)  It's not that difficult a job, just painstaking
with all the staple removal, and having an extra pair of hands sure helped a
bunch!

My question is:  There is a horizontal bar across the front of the pop-top
roof, right in front of the latch mechanism, what is this bar for?  I saw no
mention of it in the instructions, but I had to remove it to get to the
staples on the old canvas.

So, the pop top is in, the new carpet is in, the custom built camp stool and
jump seat are built, the custom built full length rear seat/bed is built...
today is tire mount, padding and upholstery day, tomorrow is Formica,
curtains and spruce up/odds n' ends day...  Yikes, a lot of work, but
hopefully she'll be all ready for us to leave on Thursday morning for the
Gathering.  I'll get some pics up on my website Wednesday when she's all
pretty like...
