Subject: Help! Need exterior cargo door handle! (pre-68)

Earlier in the summer I sold off my &quot;spare&quot; exterior cargo door handle
because I was &quot;covered&quot; and felt like I wanted to help a list member keep
his bus on the road. That old Kharma thing. Well....
Last night while working on the RFH I was stupid enough to try to open the
door and BANG that mutha snapped right off in my hand. Now I get to shop for
one for myself! &lt; dummy, dummy, dummy, dummy, dummy... &gt;

I'm looking for 221 841 631 H 

Me thinks that the &quot;H&quot; might not matter that much. I have seen several
differing letters following the numbers. I have another but it looks like it
was in that Great Lakes Beetle barnacle experiment... Chrome is pathetically
pitted. I am guessing that the joys of the new rubber took it's toll on the
handle. Can anyone help? Will that old Kharma thing complete the cycle? What
goes around etc? Well I need it come around.
