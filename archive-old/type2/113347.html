Subject: Re: [T2] Re:Real or Photoshop?  (Long, but fairly conclusive)

Hi Doyt,

I too have put lots of groceries on the table with photoshopping skillz.

The lighting in the pic is consistent in both subject and background. 
The transparent areas in the subject correspond well to the background. 
There is no evidence of repeating elements that would prove cloning had 
taken place. If it's a fake, it's pretty well done.

  The rectangular elements that you're seeing could just as easily be 
artifacts of the JPEG compression, or from the original scan. Anyone 
who even halfway knows how to retouch wouldn't use the rectangle tool. 
And besides, even some cloning wouldn't prove the subject was faked... 
I often use the cloning tool to clean up a scan and remove defects or 
undesired items from the image. There is a bit of blurring on the 
foliage to the right of the bus, but that could easily be explained as 
a defect in the original photo.

The best evidence against it's real-file existence is the arrangement 
of the front drive-tracks. There doesn't appear to be enough room to 
turn the front tracks to steer the thing. But I'm not an expert in 
tracked vehicle suspension or steering, and even if it isn't possible 
to steer that doesn't make it a fake. It could just as easily be a 
failed experiment or even a non-operational movie prop.

As far as I am concerned the image quality is too low to judge for 
certain one way or the other.



HOWEVER...
I had another look at the source page to see if I could dig up more 
evidence one way or the other.  The camper in the picture turns out to 
be a perfect match for the site-owner's own ride, except for the front 
tire cover and license plate.  These elements turn up elsewhere on the 
same page as button art, which does not lend credibility to our 
subject. Mind you, for all I know every other bus in Scotland may wear 
one of those covers, :^). The website also features a lot of quality 
art that would easily put such trickery within the capability required.

So I looked a little harder, and found this page:
http://www.wognum.co_dot_uk/fotoflare/early_years/aaw

The license plate and tire cover are a perfect match. Unless the 
photographer took them off his own bus and put them on the strangely 
similar-looking tracked monstrosity to take a picture, I'd say it's a 
fake.

Richard, did you already know the answer when you asked the question??


Happy trails,

&gt; Interesting. I work with PhotoShop several hours almost every day. I 
&gt; copied the web photo and opened it in PS and did some levels 
&gt; adjustments.  It looks like someone used a blur tool on big areas of 
&gt; pixels in the forest background at the front of the bus.  And the 
&gt; background that is visible through the windshield is too good and the 
&gt; same area has a perfect right angle in the frame under high 
&gt; zoom....reminds me of what you see when you use a rectangular 
&gt; selection tool. Also, the pattern of the ground on which the beast 
&gt; sits is like those available with the custom shape tool.
&gt;
&gt; It feels like photoshop in lots of places.
