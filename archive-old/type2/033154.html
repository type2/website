Subject: Re: Regular vs Premium

&gt; I beg to differ. Octane is octane. There are two methods
&gt; used to determine octane, research method and motor method.
&gt; If you can use a FTP site go to

You're forgetting one -- the method we use here in the US.

It is the average of the Research method and the Motor method (RON+MON)/2
See the yellow sticker on the pump next time, the formula is clearly
displayed.

An RON rating of 91 (what is specified by VW) works out to a CLC method
(method above) of 87.  At least according to Volkswagen.  See your owner's
manual.

High octane is for high-compression engines.  Air-cooled Volkswagen engines
are not high-compression.  Regular unleaded (87 octane in the US) is great
for the VW engine.

Higher octane gas won't hurt, it's just money you don't need to spend.
