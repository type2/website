Subject: panel van vents

you wrote:There is one more interesting tidbit that I forgot to mention in my
original post.  Not only does this van have the nine louvres on each
side for the engine room [punched outwards, as opposed to inwards on
the later splitties], but it also has an additional three louvres on
each side right below the drip rail and in-line with the engine air
louvres.  Is this helpful?  I assume that it is common to the early
60's panels?

It also had the single bench seat and reserve fuel tank lever,
overridders, - - - -

the extra vents by the roof are common to all bench seat splittie panel vans
