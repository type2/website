&gt; Have you adjusted the [clutch] cable to Bentley spec.?

Bentley's at the top of the one-of-the-next-thing-to-buy list.  I have a
Haynes at present.

&gt; Give it an hour on the freeway.  Low, cool speeds won't do much.

After I'm sure that I've got him in relatively safe driving condition.

&gt; &gt;He also needs new air cleaner, and an oil change would probably not hurt.

Waiting on clients to ante up. :O)

&gt; When was the last time you replace the shift rod bushings?  And no, you do
not need to cast some.  They are readily, and cheaply available.  8o)

Just started seriously working on him.  Haven't replaced much of anything
other than fuses.  Actually, I can cast soft bushings and grommets out of
RTV silicone, but haven't had any reason to yet.

&gt; Probably needs shocks.  Oil filled OEMs are the be$t, but Gas-A-Justs on
the rear, and Gas Riders on the front will suffice, for quite a bit le$$.

Are Gas ____'s available at WalMart or a FLAPS, or specialty shop?  I can
get the OEM's after a few big jobs start paying off.

&gt; Tie rod ends.  When's the last time you replaced 'em?  Maybe the steering
box, but let's just hope it's the tie rod ends.

Would it hurt to adjust the steering box?

&gt; The [turn signal] working, or is it the flasher relay/fuse/bulbs/wiring?

The switch handle is literally loose in the column.  It allows the high beam
switch to work, but no turn signals.

&gt; Replace the oil first.  If you don't have any, get some at the store while
&gt; you're there.

Okie dokie.
