&gt; Hello,
&gt;         I would like to submit a question to the all knowing and all-powerful
&gt; list. I have a 1965 21 Window Deluxe Microbus (non-walkthru) which needs
&gt; both a middle and rear seat. I would like to know if a non-walkthru
&gt; deluxe ever originally came with the smaller 2/3 seat (that I've seen in
&gt; walk-thrus) or ONLY with the full seat with the pivoting back-rest near
&gt; the doors. All the old ads I've seen show the nine seat arrangement.
&gt;         I just bought the 2/3 middle seat from Dan Kinsey (That VWguy). In the
&gt; meantime I am happy to have a seat which fits there.  But if this is not
&gt; &quot;correct&quot; I would like to eventually trade the smaller seat for the full
&gt; length one. Thanks,

I don't recall our '65 deluxe seat folding forward, but it was full 
width. To get to the back seat, we would have to open both side doors.

I think the full width seat was stock.
