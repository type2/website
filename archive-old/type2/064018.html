Subject: Re: Propane Heaters - venting

I'd like to echo Morris' thoughts (below) regarding venting of propane
heaters and to congratulate him on his good judgement in buying and
installing one in lieu of unvented heaters.  I worked several years for a
natural gas utility company and used to get called out on CO poisoning
incidents.  Many of these involved unvented catalytic heaters and similar
devices.  This is a NASTY way to die (or, alternatively, to get turned into
a vegetable!) and you certainly won't leave a good-looking corpse for your
loved ones to admire.  In case you didn't know, CO poisoning leaves your
skin a sort of shade of bright red. 

Also, CO poisoning sneaks up on you.  The gas is odorless and colorless -
and you can absorb a substantial dose before you begin to notice that
anything is wrong.  By this time, your mental and physical functions may be
impaired to the point that you aren't capable of responding to the problem
in a timely and proper way.  The hemoglobin in your blood absorbs the CO
just like it was O2, but then can't release it.  Even if you have not
absorbed an immediately  lethal dose, if you are out in the woods, away from
ambulances, doctors, hyperbaric chambers and other medical help - you may
just sit there and die.  I have seen a few such victims.  Take my word for
it - you don't want to go this way.    

Catalytic or IR propane heaters have their place (open duck blinds,
well-ventilated high volume warehouses, open air sheds, etc.), but a
closed-up bus at night isn't one of them.  (Read the instructions that come
with the darn things!)  If you are responsible for the lives of others
(spouse, kids, pets, etc), DON'T use one of these things in your van under
ANY circumstances.  Use more blankets, cuddle together for warmth, or stay
home!  If you are traveling by yourself, do what you think best  - -  but be
prepared to accept the consequences - Just let Joel know ahead of time the
name and e-mail of the person who will be inheriting your van. 

Think about this.  Catalytic heaters are a LOT cheaper than vented
furnace-type heaters.  If catalytics were safe to use in this kind of
application, don't you think that VW and every other conversion van and RV
manufacturer would be installing them as original equipment to get their
(rather extravagant) prices down?  

My professional opinion is that I would only use a catalytic heater in a van
if all the windows were wide open - no doubt negating the effect of the
heater altogether.  I've seen too much with my own eyes to waffle or
otherwise equivocate about this one.   

The Suburban and Propex heaters and others of their ilk are designed to work
safely in this kind of application.  Save up your shekels and buy one.  Get
it installed professionally if you're not sure how to do it.  And don't even
think about disconnecting or otherwise thwarting the operation of the
installed safety devices to make it run &quot;better.&quot;  You can find 'em or order
'em at any large RV equipment dealer.  If you think you can't afford one,
stop by a funeral parlor and get some comparison prices on mid-range caskets.

And, frankly, installation of a CO detector is a good idea (if not a
necessity) even if all you have is a stove to heat your morning coffee on -
especially now that they're priced within reach of the average person.

&gt;
&gt;I know we've hashed through this last year and we'll probably hash 
&gt;through it again this year, but....
&gt;
&gt;The Bus is a small, confined area. Even if you find a combustion device 
&gt;that is 100% efficient (producing only CO2 and H2O), you're oxygen levels 
&gt;in a closed BUS will decrease and your supposedly 100% efficient heater 
&gt;will start producing CO because it does not have enough oxygen. 
&gt;
&gt;Heaters with separate combustion airways alleviate most of the worry 
&gt;about the above scenario (but are necessarily less efficient...)
&gt;
&gt;FTR, I've slept in my (closed) Bus (at different times) with a portable
&gt;infrared heater (2000 BTU)--I lived, a vented open flame heater (5000 
&gt;BTU-that
&gt;burns inside air), and an AC ceramic heater (which of course is the safest
&gt;and easiest). I've just recently chucked them all in favor of a 12000 BTU
&gt;Suburban furnace.
&gt;
&gt; The Propex heaters you guys are talking about sound great considering
&gt;their extremely small size: but, alas, I have already shoe-horned my
&gt;Suburban into place....(the electricity demand of the Propex seems
&gt;excessive, however...)
&gt;
&gt;And, of course, please, if you have any desire to live, buy a CO detector!
