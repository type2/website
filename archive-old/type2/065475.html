&gt; &gt;This has come up with me before.  It used to be that the boot kits &gt;had
&gt; &gt;a new washer.
&gt; 
&gt; The RMMW boot kits not only come with new washers, they also come
&gt; with new bolts!  All for $9.95!  Promptly delivered, reasonable,
&gt; german boot kits.  I was impressed!  I will definately get my next
&gt; mail-order stuff from RMMW.  Lifetime warranty, to boot!
