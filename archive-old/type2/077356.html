Just go to Radio Shack and get a bigger bulb or source one from a junkyard 
bus for the brake indicator.

Same for the speedo - it drives right off of the wheel. Bolt in swap.

Do what we did in Italy. Make these changes - get through inspection and 
then go home and return the car to it's previous condition so your mileage 
stays the same.

In fact - just borrow an instrument cluster from a friend's van and get 
inspected - then return your bus to Canadian specs.

Ciao!
