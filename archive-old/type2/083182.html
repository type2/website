Subject: crumbly B-fluid reservoir

I'm on the last lap of replacing my master cyclinder.
('68 with shoe brakes all around. No assist on the
master cylinder.)

Thanks to those who guided and encouraged me.

But --&amp;%$#_at_*!!-- the neck of the refill reservoir
broke off when I replaced the cap.
I can't find a replacement on line or in a junk yard.
This is the plastic bottle above the brake pedal
against the front wall. the lower reservoir is OK.

It seems to just be a way to put fluid in the real
reservoir down below so... Until I can find a
replacement could I:

1. just put a cork in the hole? I live in a desert, so
water obsorbtion would be low.

2. clean the broken reservoir and restore it (glue it
back together) with epoxy/mesh ? (it's apparently as
rare as a Ming Dynasty vase)

3.  make/rig a completely new reservoir from a plastic
or metal bottle or the reservoir off a newer vehicle?

In short, how important is this unit and it's cap with
little tiny holes?

Along the same line, what are u folks using for dust
covers on the bleeders? Mine are all missing and I
can't find replacements.
