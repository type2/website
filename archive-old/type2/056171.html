Hello.  My name is Andrew Butcher and I've rebuilt my 1600 dual port. I
have a couple of questions, and hopefully you can help me out.  I put
the engine back into the car, and found I had a nasty oil leak from the
rear main oil seal, leaking into the clutch.
Clutch + lubricant = 40 mph top speed because of a badly slipping
clutch.  I pulled the engine again, and tapped in a new oil seal with a
hammer (I know, I hadn't read your oil seal sermon yet) and the leak was
still there.  This seems like more than a simple little leak coming from
the cuts made by a hammer.  I think my oil passage must be blocked (like
you said in your sermon).  I guess I have to open up the cases again,
and I was just wondering where the oil passage is located, and how do I
clean it out? I suspect that the gasket material has hardened so how do
I remove it fully?  If I'm totally off on something here, don't be
afraid to tell me that, because this is my first work on vw's and cars
in general.  All of my past experience has been with 2 stroke dirtbikes.
I'm only seventeen, so I guess this explains a lot right?  Well, thanks
for listening, and I hope you can help me out.  If you're too busy I
understand, but you sure seem like a nice enough guy.  Thanks a bunch.
I drive a 69 robin egg blue beetle and I love it.

                                               Sincerely:
                                              Andrew Butcher
