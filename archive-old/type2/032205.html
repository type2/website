--&gt; That is an issue.  It's not a small job to make the switch and get it
running well -- and it'll never run as well as it did on FI, on the
occasions it did run. ;)  You'll note I've never taken a stand saying
carbs are better.  They aren't.

Part of what influenced my decision is that I tend to take long trips in
this van, and I need it to get me there.  The FI had gotten to the point
where I could no longer count on it doing that.  23 years of indifferent
maintenance and corrosion take their toll.  When the ECU failed, it was
the straw that broke the camel's back.

I may come to regret my decision eventually, but I wanted to make it clear
it wasn't something I entered into lightly, or through fear of the
unknown.  I'm an EET student...electrons don't frighten me. ;)  The idea
of spending $275 on a rebuilt ECU that wasn't even returnable did,
however, bother me.  You can bet I checked the wiring harness and all the
other components every way I knew how, before I gave up, though.

&gt; 
&gt; To each his own I suppose.  But I won't be buying your van unless you
&gt; give me all the FI stuff ;-)

--&gt; That's understandable.  And it's your money. :)  Besides, you're 
farther south than me...this is a Michigan van.  You wouldn't want it
anyway, due to the amount of it that's been converted to iron oxide over
the years. ;)
