Subject: Re: Replacing Fuel Lines

Don't forget to replace the little ~1&quot; long hose up high on the left
wall of the engine compartment (over where the auxiliary battery would
go). We've been talking about that one lately as a source of mysterious
gas fumes, and my mechanics missed that one when they replaced all my
fuel lines.
