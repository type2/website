Subject: Re: [T2] Aux Air Regulator - How open should it be?

&gt; and if you want faster idle, just adjust loosen the nut and slide it one
&gt; way or another and it'll open more...

I figured that's what that nut was for. It was already opened fully,
so I guess that's that. Cold idle is fine now, so I must have fixed a
vacuum leak or it was stuck and I loosened it by pulling it out.
Whatever, it's good now.

Thanks!
