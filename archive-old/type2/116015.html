&gt; Sure, let's wait a few days and I'll order enough for everyone who wants
&gt; some. Anything less than a pound is $4 US Priority. Probably send 10 tubes
&gt; in one box for 1 pound shipping. Know that any Bosch Authorized Parts
&gt; Spezialist, such as me, can order anything Bosch makes, if you can provide
&gt; the right item/part no. Thousands of parts listed that show in no catalog,
&gt; only no., one or two word description and price. A few of these things I
&gt; know, like the greases and dizzy hardware kits, for example.
&gt; 
&gt; Why don't you collect orders for a bunch, I'll give you a descent margin on
&gt; 10 or 20 tubes, and you can pass on the savings or take a small profit to
&gt; ship to all who want one.

FYI
