Subject: O-ring shims vs non O-ring shims

does anyone know the difference between the flywheel end-play shims for 
O-ring and non-O-ring flywheels? i have heard that they are not 
interchangeable....what year was the first O-ring flywheel...'69? can you 
use an O-ring flywheel on an older motor and vice-versa?
