Subject: Steering box for 71 Campmobile

Volks,

Our friendly local VW mechanic has diagnosed the 71's difficulty in
steering and wide turning radius as a worn steering box and tie rods. 
He says that the steering box is hard to find and doesn't know when he
can find it for us. 

We're turning to the list for help - does anyone know where we can find
the steering box?  He's not particularly gung ho on the idea of using a
used one.

I'm in the Northern Virginia area.  Please mail me directly if you can
offer any suggestions.

Thanks in Advance,
Karen
