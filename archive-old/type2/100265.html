Subject: Re: [T2] coleman heater in a bus

Hi Folks,

I've been using a Coleman Black Cat for a few years now, and I'd recommend 
it to anybody who has heating issues in their Bus.  I use it mostly for 
camping, but have used it while driving as well.  For driving, I set it on 
its stand between the seats and facing forward, and it adds some nice toasty 
warmth to the cab area.  For camping, I keep it between the seats, but 
reverse it, and it heats up the rear area after about 20 or 30 minutes.

I agree with the previous posts about moisture and O2 consumption.  I 
usually leave one of the vent windows open when I'm camping, and I don't use 
it when I'm sleeping.  When I'm driving, I keep the fresh air vents open 
partway, and the front windows stay clear.  In all cases, I've found that 
the rear windows fog up.

Of course, it's not as efficient or as stock as an Eberspacher, but it's a 
lot more portable and it's a lot less likely to short out and set your Bus 
on fire.  As always, YMMV.

Good luck!
