Subject: Re: Turn Signal Question - Update

Thank you to everyone who has responded to my post about the turn signal problems. Through your help I was able to get closer, but still no go. I know what the problem is (I think). I think it is in the switch itself because I saw visible signs of it being opened previously, then when I opened it I found no metal parts (I think there should be a slider or something), only the plastic parts. I have detailed everything and included pictures on a web page:

On the page I am asking for help in manually activating the turn signals to see if they will or will not (hazard lights now work fine) light. I created a little template numbering the contacts and am hoping that someone can tell me to simply connect contact #1 to #3 and the right blinker will go on, etc... 

Also, it seems as though the major problem was the relays were full of water from the crack around the front window seam. I dumped the water, cleaned them up, fixed a rusted spring or two, and all is great, high/low lights and all! (well, except turn signals).

If you guys/gals could, could you visit the switch page?
