&gt; DON'T use Goof-off!!!  Goof-off works great, but not for removing sickers off
&gt; your bus.  I can't believe others would reccomend it.  They obviously haven't
&gt; used it on paint.  It cuts paint about as quick as acetone.  I have used both
&gt; Goof-off and WD-40 while experimenting, and I haven't found any paint WD-40 will
&gt; damage.  Hope you havn't tried it yet or you'll see the primer in about 30
&gt; seconds and bare metal in about another minute!

Looking closer at the bottle of Goof Off that I have, there is a VERY small 2 after
the product name.   What I have been using is Goof Off 2, a &quot;water based,
environmentally acceptable&quot; cleaner.  Claimes to be for use on fully cured varnished
and oil based painted surfaces, etc, etc, etc.  Its always worked for me.  Then
again, my daughters are not putting Dead Head stickers on my car.  I have pealed the
outer covering of the sticker off, wet the remaining gunk down, let it sit and then
wipe and repeat until gone.
