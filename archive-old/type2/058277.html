Subject: new tranny ailments

        I was putzing around Great Falls with few worries this weekend...My
used axles with good CVs and boots arrived in the mail from Brax and I was
planning on installing them Sunday or Monday.  The slow speed rythmic thump
was gradually getting louder and I figgered that was a likely suspect.  Then
Sunday evening she begins to kick out of 2nd gear at low speed.  I asked a
couple of knowledgeable folks I know and the consensus was a replacement
tranny was in order.  But I should be able to nurse it along for a week or
so and make the 200 mile trip to Brax to pickup and install either a
used($250) or rebuilt ($400) unit.
Mon and Tues I make as few trips as possible and drive gently.  This morning
I'm backing into my parking spot at work when it really starts to get sad.
She eases back ok at first but when I push in the clutch to coast while
still in reverse it locks up and rocks the bus!
Not good methinks!  At lunch time I nurse her home and pick up my Ch*vy p/u
and hit the DMV to renew the tags (exp in June).   I guess my question is
after all this whining is:
-what are my chances of driving this puppy 200miles to Butte?  
-am I gonna be stuck removing the axles and towing it down?  
suggestions and comments gratefully sought.
thanks
