Subject: Re: Tubing for tent frame
Content-Disposition: inline

On the same thread,  I am trying to make some westy-esque accessories for my 78 and need the tool that necks down tubing, like Westy tent poles are.  Does anyone know of a hand tool that does that?  Or is it done in a big press?

thanks
