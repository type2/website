Hello Everyone.  It has been a while since I have subscribed to the list so
I am kind of lost.  I have spent the last two years working full time and
finishing my college degree, so my VW has had a long rest.  I am wondering
if PLFVW is still operating?  I tried emailing and calling but I have not
received a response.  I checked the archive and only found an old thread
that didn't sound too promising, however more recent postings suggest she
still operating.  When I last subscribed to the list it was common knowledge
that she crafted a superior product.  I am specifically interested in a
beige colored fabric that she offers.  Anyone have the latest info?  If not
how about an alternative?
Thanks,
Phillip Freund
