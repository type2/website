&gt; Thanks!  Midas quoted me a ~$500 repair job on the brakes.  They wanted to
&gt; replace both my rear drums at a meager $99 apiece as well as both wheel
&gt; cylnders for $60 each.  Of course the shoes were bad too, etc. etc.
&gt; 
&gt; Needless to say, I took the quote with the parts list down to my local
&gt; junkyard and got 2 freshly turned drums, 2 wheel cylnders, 4 new shoes,
&gt; cotter pins, castle nut removal tool, and a few odds and ends for $100.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm going to redo my brakes this weekend. I've never fussed with wheel
&gt; cynders before so it ought to be fun and worrisome!

Apply your favorite Liquid Wrench analog to all fittings for a couple of
days before you take it apart.  Be sure to use the correct brake line
wrenches on the brake lines.  Regular open end wrenches will tend to round
them off.

I hope that you kept an eye on the fun folks at Midas.  It isn't unknown
for vehicles to leave Midas with more problems than they came in with.
