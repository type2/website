Subject: Vacuum Idle Retard connection - 71 DP

I've got a new-to-me 71' DP engine that I'm trying to get in tip top 
shape.  It runs very well now with two notable exceptions.  First, after 
warming up it will not hold idle.  Since it is a 71 it has both vacuum 
retard and advance.  I can't find any diagrams in Muir or Bently to show 
where to connect these 2 items.

Currently, I have a hose running from the left side of the intake manifold 
to what I believe is the vacuum advance (which is the nipple on the outside 
of distributer facing backwards, away from the distributer).  Where does 
the idle retard hose connect to?

Also, the engine has an aftermarket exhaust.  Hence, the pre-warming tubes, 
or whatever the connection from the muffler to the intake manifold is 
called), doesn't line up very well.  Could this connection be causing a 
vacuum leak that could manifest itself by stalling?

Like I said, the engine feels strong, although there is a hesitation at low 
rpms which I believe is related to the inability to idle.

TIA.
