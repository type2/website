Subject: Re: Pushrod tube seals + silicone

A few years back a couple of the more reputable engine builders here in So. 
Cal turned me on to something really cool that I have used on all my engine 
build ups ever since without any leaks.  I used to use the RTV's and Permatex 
stuff and sure enough I would always get leaks.  Go to your local Yamaha 
Motorcycle dealer and get a tube of &quot;Yamabond #4&quot; from the service 
department.  It is great stuff as it stays plyable and cleans off with 
acetone or lacquer thinner.
