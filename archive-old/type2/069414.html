Subject: Joel, Don't Change the Stats!

Well kids, I totally scored this past weekend!

My friend Rich and I always get into this discussion about how it 
would be to be able to go back in time and drive a BRAND NEW '50 
Barndoor off of the lot.  What it would be like to have a NEW VW, (any 
year really (up to '67)).  But to just have the WHOLE thing.  No 
missing parts, and a brand new engine.  We know it's just a dream... 
until last Friday!

I am now the proud owner of a 1956 Oval Window Bug!  Totally 
Restored--just like it came off the lot.

Here's how I happened upon it:

Thursday July 25, 1996:

I drive down to a local VW friend's (Eric) house to get some parts 
for my '59 Singlecab as I'm working on getting the brakes
redone. We are chatting and the neighbors are admiring my '57 Bus. I 
go back and search in the bucket o' bolts for the parts
I'm after. As I walk behind his house where he stores all kinds of 
cool &quot;in progress&quot; VW's, there sits this Robin Egg Blue '56
Oval Window bug that he'd done the body work on last summer. I begin 
to admire it because it is totally done. A beautiful
all-white interior, blue canvas sunroof, fabulous white-walls. 

I find the bolts I'm looking for and go out front. Some folks have 
arrived to look at the work he is doing on their Sealing Wax
Red '56 Oval (in his garage). It's in progress, but looks great so 
far.

Eric mentions that the bug is for sale to the higest bid over $4k. 
Wow! They as well as I go balistic. I know personally over
over $10k that is into the bug. They all want to buy it to have a 
pair of '56's and I want it too. Anyhow, after some talking they
decide they don't need two, as this guy already has like five too 
many cars at home. I am excited.

I return home and tell my mom about it. She loves old VW's too. I 
decide to go for it after somehow a price of $3500 is
negotiated!!! I count my pennies and come up $1800 short. Luclily my 
mom knows a good deal when she sees it, and decided
to go halfsies with me! (Thanks Mom!)

Friday, July 26, 1996:

I get off work early and we get her money, then rush to my bank and 
get my money and go to Eric's house at the appointed
time of 5:30p to make the deal. Well no one is home other than the 
babysitter. She doesn't know when he is supposed to get
home, and so I decide to wait for a while. 20 minutes later she comes 
out and said that he called and that he'd be home at nine.
I go home sorta bummed, because by this time I'm positive that the 
seller is going to back out on such a cheap deal.

Nine rolls around and THINGS ARE STILL ON! We run down give away 
$3500 and drive home in a new bug!

Here's the vital stats:

'56 Oval Window Bug
CV Joint Rear End
Freeway-Filer 4th gear
2020cc - Dual Webber Progessives 
Conti Whitewalls!  &lt;they make me happy!&gt;

Of course you are encouraged to check out the bug for yourself!
