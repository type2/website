Subject: thermostat holder bracket
Message-ID: &lt;0.8f79b659.254af6e6_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Does anyone have a bracket to hold the thermostat on a 1600 they want to 
sell?  I have the rest of the parts installed but don't have a bracket.  
Ordered one some time ago and it was backordered.  I thought it came in but I 
can't find it in my stash and I don't want to pay the $20+ for another new 
one.
