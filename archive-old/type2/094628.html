Subject: Re: [T2] 81 vanagon slide window help

Moss?? where on the window, went out and looked at my 82 westy to 
confirm  a  suspicion, the window galss  and assembly are held in by the 
seal.  checked in a parts listing and there is nothing in the vanagons 
except the seal holding the windows ( and  a  315ml tube of adhesive)  
If you are talking down in the tracks, qtips, small brushes,  alcohol 
should  work.
