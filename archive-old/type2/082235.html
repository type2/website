Subject: Re: [T2] Look'n to buy a bus (Pre '73)

Hiya Terry,

&quot;Still looking for my dream bus with a pop-top. Prefer
the pre-'73 era buses. Something totally restored,
that needs nothing. I don't have the patience or tools
needed to do any work myself. I just wanna put in the
key and goooooooo! &quot;

This should be pretty simple.  Just pull out your wallet and payyyyyyyyyy!
