The Muir book is NOT out of print, according to
Amazon. They sell 30th anniversary issue for $20, and
the official Bentley manual is under $30.  Both should
be available at any good book store, and if you aren't
experienced with VWs, you should have as many manuals
as possible (in my opinion) as none of them tell you
everything.  The Muir book is good entertainment and
inspiration, but you want the Bentley book (or at
least the Haynes manual) for more details and photos
and pictures.
