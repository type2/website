Subject: add-on gauges: recommendations?


Hello again,

I am picking up my new-to-me 71 hardtop Westie on
Saturday after having new heads, piston, rings, and
jugs installed, and would very much like to install
some gauges to keep an eye on the engine in the
future.  The shop says oil pressure is strong (~60lbs
cold, 30 hot _at_ idle) and the bottom end is good.  

I am thinking: oil pressure gauge, oil telp gauge,
head temp gauge, and voltmeter (po says engine cooked
when it overheated after the belt broke, so I don't
want to rely solely on the generator idiot light
alone).  I know that soudns like a lot (four gauges),
but I don't mind he work and dash space they'll take
up.

Any recomendations on brands to use or avoid?  I use
and like autometer in my Taurus SHO.  

Thanks!

Chris
71 Westie (soon!)
90 Taurus SHO w/some mods
a binch of Vespa scooters...
and a couple Lambretta scooters in need of resto!
