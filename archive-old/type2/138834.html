&gt; Hmmm... check the archive. Didn't we just recently discuss this issue? Your
&gt; bus sags about like mine, which is a little more than most I've seen. The
&gt; previous thread suggested the front is supposed to be sprung up in the air a
&gt; little so that it balances level with a 240 pound occupant in the driver
&gt; seat.

I swear I've got less sag now than in that photo still without an
adjustment.

My point was, how can one eyeball it? I think you really need to measure it
to find out.
