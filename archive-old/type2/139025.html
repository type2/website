&gt; I would expect a new, never fired engine to have some leakdown.
&gt; Rings haven't sealed to the cylinder yet, so plenty of clearance.

Yes, the other three cylinders are fine.

&gt; Umm, but 20% and non closing valve is *not* good...so exhaust valve is
&gt; leaking air out...hmmm...I don't suppose you can see anything like a piece
&gt; of paper or anything stuck in the valve opening anywhere?

No. I can only see about 50% of the valve head mating area.

&gt; I recently received a botched packing list, incorrect delivery time and
&gt; cylinder head that was shy about a quarter inch of thread on an exhaust stud
&gt; from AVP.

The engine was 2 days late being delivered but that's no big deal. Of course
I tried to call them for 2 days and gave up when the engine arrived.
