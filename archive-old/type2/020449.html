Subject: Kooky math teacher at it again

Hi Volks,
Some of you who have ben around awhile might remember the junk yard trip

I took some of my students on a couple years ago. Well, I di something a

bit different with my sixth graders.  We just finished a section
converting currency using  equations.  I wanted to tie in mathematics,
computers, and a real life application for my classes.  I came up with
'A Bus Shopping Spree.'  This was their assignment:

              A VOLKSWAGEN BUS SHOPPING SPREE!

Mr. Auch needs to buy some parts and accessories for his new
bus. He cant find anything he needs in The USA, so he goes
online to see what he can find. He finds a company in The
United Kingdom called Just Kampers
(http://www.justkampers.co_dot_uk). He can order online but has to
make sure at the cost in US dollars. Use your spread sheet to
figure out what each item will cost and get a total for ‘Da Bus’.
The stuff Mr. Auch needs for his 1970 bus are:

  1.Quick release battery Terminals
  2.Pagid Front Brake Shoes
  3.Sliding Windows (both left and right)
  4.New seals to fit the sliding windows
  5.A Drive Away Tent Awning.

Thanks for your help!

They had a blast!  I got some pretty cool looking spread sheets
