Hello,

Thanks again to all who contribute to the list. I hope to do so myself soon.
I am experimenting with 1 Weber and 1 Holley progressive carb and 3
different distributors, a 009, a 050, and a mechanical/vacuum unit from a 73
automatic I have a 72 Westy w/1700cc engine.  So far I can say for sure that
the Weber does provide a vacuum pulse that will work the vacuum advance
unit. I set it at 7.5 degrees BTDC with the retard port left unplugged. It
advances to 40 degrees at 3600 rpms, possibly higher at higher rpms, but I
did not want to push the engine. The advance seems quick. Not positive, but
it seemed to advance to 28 degrees at 1600 rpms. The greatest difficulty I
had was setting the idle. The vacuum port on both the Weber and the Holley
enters the venturi just a hair above the throttle plate when the plate is
completely closed. Open the plate just a little more than a little an the
vacuum will advance and the rpms increase. That's why it is critical that
the idle circuit be clean and functioning properly and that there are no
vacuum leaks. I cleaned and inspected the carb and checked for vacuum leaks
at the same time I installed the mechanical/vacuum unit. Even so, I settled
for 8000 rpms at idle. If I opened the throttle plate any more the
distributor advanced and idle went to 1000-1100.

 I have run only one tank of gas with this unit, but it seems that the
mileage has improved to 19 mpg from 15 or 16mpg with the other units, this
in cold weather (icing) and running the BN4. I need to use the 050 and the
009 in warm weather to make a reasonable comparison as to mileage, advance,
and the dreaded bucking, which is all but gone at this point. The reduction
in hesitation may be more due to the weather being warm than the change in
distributors. I just drove the bus for 2 hours on the highway at 60 to 70
miles and hour, one hour north, one hour south with a south wind of 15-20
mph 82 degrees F. The max temp was 244 degrees, but it was rising. The bus
would accelerate slowly from say 60 to 70 mph against the wind and up a
slight grade over a distance of 1/2 mile or so. One other point: The vacuum
advance port on the carb is one of greater diameter than the one on the
distributor, so I needed to use a reducing connection on the vacuum hose.
I'll post more as I learn more. I know enough to suggest to owners using the
&quot;three season&quot; Weber/Holley that they experiment with a mechanical/vacuum
advance distributor if at all possible.

 My questions pertain to valve clearances. When a VW mechanic installed my
clutch and replaced some seals, he said something to me about something (the
valve stem?) being &quot;cupped&quot; or worn on the #3 cylinder, and that he had to
reduce the clearance to keep the valve from clacking. I adjusted the valves
today and set both valves for #3 at .006. The front (front is front) valve
(not sure if intake or exhaust) was set at something like .003 or possibly
even less. After setting it properly, sure enough a loud clacking, the
noisiest valve I have ever heard, more like a knock. What's the problem?
Should I go back to the tighter spec? Seems like I read somewhere that there
are caps for the valve stems. Is this possible? If so where can I get one
and how do I install it? Also, there is a weird looking spring-like device
that runs the length of the head, in, under and around the rocker assembly.
It is missing on the right head. I'd prefer to have it, but am I running any
great risk without it?

Thanks

Rich Patano
