Did you decode the markings to find out the DOM for the tire?

&gt;Heck, most of the people who have endured
&gt;a tire thread or two on the board know more about
&gt;tires than the average idiot behind the counter
&gt;at the tire store.  

It's like going to McD's except they ask if &quot;you want chrome valve caps with that&quot;? :)
