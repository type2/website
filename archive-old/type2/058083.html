Subject: Why I drive a VW type2 and not American raw steel

This is a typical friday post, anybody who don´t understand irony and my
humor should stop reading right now!

Many of my friends have asked me why I don´t buy a new car and put my
thrusty bus to rest. They say the bus is unsafe and cold to drive in the
winter. They say I should buy a Chevy van to carry my stuff around. 

They are right about the &quot;cold thing&quot; They are also right about the fact
that the deformation zone in the bus is not much larger than my shoe size.
(well, I got big feet) But I still have to disagree with them about some
safety issues, first:

 &quot;The fire thing.&quot;
Here in Finland we do see a lot of movies produced in America, old movies
and new movies. And it have struck me how easily American cars burst up
into flames even in minor accidents. As soon as the car hits any kind of
object it explodes with flames going high up in the air. Followed by a
muchroom shaped cloud. People and objects in the area are thrown  long
distances. Strange enough most of them surwive, especially the good guys....

Every time I drive my sisters C***Y van I´m scared to death to hit anything
with it:-) 

Another thing about American cars is :

 &quot;The lost brakes thing&quot;
After watching hundres of Hollywood productions I must say that it´s
incredible how a car accelerates when the brakes fail. The normal scenery
is this: The bad guys have sabotaged the brakes in the good guys car, when
the good guy hits the brakes the car starts to accelerate like a top fuel
dragster. First it goes off the road, trough a picked fence,over a ditch,
right trough a barn, hits a tree, bounces back and starts to accelerate
again and doesn´t stop until it hits a mountain or some other very solid
object. Strange enough a car with this kind of brake failure seldom bursts
up into flames like the previous example. Exept for situations where the
driver can throw himself out of the car before the final crasch. Can´t the
driver just shift down? Time one of theese secvenses and you´ll find out
that the car must have moved about 2 kilometers.
In this case my ´71 Bus is much better. once a brake line failed and I
could stop the bus in a distance of 40 meters. That´s safety!


Now you understand why American cars don´t sell very well here in Finland,
it´s Hollywoods fault!
