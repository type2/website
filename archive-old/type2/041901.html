Been cleaning the garage, here is what I've got to get rid of:
1) One right side and two left side mirrors off a '76, silvering on mirrors 
is shot, but if you replace the mirrors they;d be perfect and won't rust in 6 
months like the repro's.

2) Tail light bulb holders, 72-79, new repro's, P/N 211 945 231, $10.00 each

3) Tail light lens (1) 72-79, original, P/N 211 945 241 RE  $15.00

4)Gauge cluster from 72-75 (?) the whole thing, ready to hook up and install 
in the dash- has speedo, gas gauge, idiot lights, etc. P/N 211 957 023   
$25.00

5) 1 side panel, front of rear wheel arch, left side, P/N 211 809 159A   $5.00

6) Front Axle beam, was going on a '76, good shape, $50.00 (will NOT ship)

7) Green vinyl covers from front door panels, not perfect but OK, from '76 
Westy, dark green.   Best offer?

8) Camper interior: Z bed, rear overhead cabinet, rear side closet, rear 
cushion that goes over engine hatch, side storage cab./ w/ ice box, plus 
fluorescent light fixture above sink/stove. Fabric is green/orange/black. 
Prefer to  sell as a package, $125.00 for all ( cannot ship) 

And last, a Century Model 130 mig welder w/ gas bottle, used very little, 
$500.00 new, will sell for $250.00 firm and cannot ship. 

All prices neg. except where noted, plus whatever it costs me to ship. I'm 
located in N. Virginia, would prefer to sell to local folks. Please p-mail me 
w/ any questions.  Thanks, Jeff
