&gt;secondly, when it comes to used vehicles in general, you are never going to
&gt;get back what you put into it. i have a '74 with a westy interior, new cv
&gt;joints, new tires, new brakes, new front end, rebuild engine, and solid body
&gt;but don't think i could get all the $2000 plus i've put into it. just don't
&gt;happen unless you find someone who doesn't know any better. that's just to
&gt;be expected from a 20+ year old vehicle.

Amen.  My bus has:

New 2.0 hydraulic-lifter engine ($1200)
new 091 transmission ($300)
new tires ($200)
new brakes ($20)
Porsche seats ($50)
$300 worth of gauges
Rebuilt carbs ($40)
Three batteries ($200)
50 watts worth of solar panels ($300)
600 watt inverter ($200)
Newer Norcold electric fridge ($600 new)
CB radio ($150)
Eberspacher gas heater (not installed, yet!)
Oh, I've got a childs cot and a couple of rear bug screens, too.

and plenty more I can't think of at the moment.  Most of those prices are
what I paid, not what they are &quot;worth&quot;.

... but I'd be lucky to get $1,800 for it because it needs a little body
work and a paint job.  And my sliding door doesn't fall off.  You post an
ad like yours on this list, where the &quot;going price&quot; is well established,
and you're gonna get a lot of responses like Jonathans.  Think of them as
guidelines which will help you establish a realistic asking price, maybe
around $2500, or more if you fix the sliding door, body, and paint.  Sorry
if that's not what you wanted to hear - maybe you should hang onto your bus
for another 10 years - you might get $5k for it in AD2006.  :-)
