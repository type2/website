&gt; Tweaking the carbs yesterday found me also considering if I would need

Greg, when you say housing, are you refering to the sheath loom that the
cable runs in between the body and the engine??

I think you need the FI trans cradle ,, or find a way to fix the throttle
loom near the trans cradle

When I installed the FI engine in my 74 Camper, I installed the FI trans
cradle from a FI bus at the same time, and the Fi throttle cable, as the
74 Carb body used a longer throttle cable and the loom was held captive in
the engine tin which is different on a Fi engine than a carb engine,,
