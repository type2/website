Subject: Sold My Westy

It was a tough decision, but I sold my '76 Westy yesterday. She went to a 
good home, and that is comforting to know. I feel there is a Vanagon Westy in 
my future, but I'm gonna just sit on the fence a while and think about it. In 
the meantime, I found these and wanted to pass them on, seen in The Valley 
Trader: 1965 Bus. 13 window Deluxe. Complete. parked for last 10 years. 
Straight body, lower body rust. good title, $400.00 (540) 743-5048

And:
 
1971 Bus camper. New yellow paint, rebuilt engine, good tires.MSTA $3,900.00 
firm
(540) 678-9012

You know what I know. Both are Va. area codes.   Happy hunting!    Jeff S.
