	My 79 bus was reported from the PO to have a burnt valve. After
yanking out the head today, to my surprise that is all it is. Nice burnt
crack in the side of the valve. Sorta makes it hard to compress air/fuel
if there is a leak like that there. What I would like to know is what
typically causes this condition. Std 2.0 w/ injection &amp; hyd. Should I be
conserned that this might happen again, or since the bus has run (at
least) 6 months w/ out any problems on the other three, assume it was
just a bad thing many moons ago.

	BTW you can get the passenger side head off w/ the engine still in
the chassis. Pain it the ... but at least I didn't have to round up
someone for half the day to help me pull the engine.
