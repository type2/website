Subject: VW emblem anchors

&gt;replacing it with an emblem?  I've removed it but the holes are way too big
&gt;for the emblem &quot;anchors.&quot;  Is this normal?  Are there some other mounts to
use
&gt;for the emblem in this case or is it not possible to use the same holes?

Chris,

there are supposed to be rubber grommets that stick in the big holes that
the emblem sticks into.  at least on my '70.  I got them from Wolfsburg
