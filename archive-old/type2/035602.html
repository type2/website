Subject: Fuel Injectors....New or Rebuilt

Hello All,

    After having the FI in my '77 Westy gone over by a mechanic with
Bosch experience I have this information. My intake manifold boots are
leaking and the #2 injector is not injecting properly. I have the boots
ordered from West Coast Metric but I am unsure on the injector. This
motor is a fresh total rebuild and I want to do it right. Should I?:

1: Replace only the # 2 injector with a new or rebuilt from NOPI / or
other....suggestions?
2: Replace all four injectors with new ones _at_ $75.00 ea
3: Replace all four injectors with Rebuilt ones _at_ $35.00 ea
4: Send my injectors off to somewhere like this Marren Motor Sports to
have my originals rebuilt/flow tested/matched/etc. _at_ approx $30.00 ea

As I said, I want to do it right, but $ 300.00 for injectors is steep.
Is it worth it? Thanks in advance for any suggestions and/or experience.

Kenny
'77 Westy FI 2.0
