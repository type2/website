No Your wrong.

The tail gates from the T2a and the T2b are different at the hinges. You
should check your vehicle to verify if it is a T2a or a In-between-model.
The 1972 modelyear has the big taillight units from the T2b but also alot of
features from the T2a.

Maybe you have a modelyear 1972 and if thats the case you should use to
1972 - 1979 version. Otherwise you should find a tail gate from modelyear
1968 - 1971.

[T2] Tail Gates


&gt; The tail gate on my '71 Westy is pretty badly rusted on the inside
but I'm not sure what years are compatible with
&gt; my '71.  My &quot;seat of the pants&quot; feeling is that '68 thru '79 are
&gt; interchangeable.  Can anyone confirm that?
