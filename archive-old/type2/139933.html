Subject: Re: [T2] Bad ges smell won't go away.

Also check the rubber fuel supply, fuel return, and fuel rail hoses 
that connect the injectors in the engine compartment.  If they are 
still original they need to be replaced unless you want the van to go 
up in flames one day.

I recently had a cracked rubber line above #3 cylinder that was 
spewing fuel.  You could smell it everywhere.  Not good...


&gt;why would it stay there?  It is a gasoline smell and not an exhaust 
&gt;smell.  There is a heater booster in the van, but I don't think it 
&gt;works, could that have something to do with it?  If my heat smells 
&gt;like gas are the only possibilities something around the fuel tank? 
&gt;I don't really mind taking off the fuel tank if I can be relatively 
&gt;sure the problem is in there somewhere.  This is killing me, please 
&gt;help.  Thank you in advance.
