Subject: Re: [T2] battery cable reversal

Nah, well not in my case :-)
On the '78 I used to have, my dad reversed the battery cables when hooking
up the battery.  No damage to anything except that the alternator died a
horrible smoky death.

Speaking of alternators, I'll have an EB trip report before long.

&gt; I guess the best thing you can be thankfull for is that it isn't a FI
&gt; engine with the burned out ECU (which it would be)
&gt;
&gt;   check each part one at a time, you could have damaged the Voltage
&gt; Regulator, maybe a few other parts but it should not be fatal damage
