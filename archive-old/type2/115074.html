Subject: Re: [T2] Muir engine sounds url? 

&gt; I've got the sound files archived but dunno what the copyright restrictions
&gt; might be. I'm willing to share but don't want to run afoul of anybody...

Please don't do that. Joe pursued and obtained permission from Eve Muir to
carry those files. My understanding is that Mrs. Muir was very gracious, and
I'm sure if somebody contacted her, she would be again--but it's up to her.
