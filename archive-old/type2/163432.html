Subject: Re: [T2] what socket

Fancy names for this tool always gets &quot;huh&quot; at most FLAPS.  It's commonly
known as a &quot;Serrated Wrench&quot;, but even that gets some blank stares.

KD Tools # 2304
8mm Serrated Wrench (12 Point)

I've been using them for over 3 decades when servicing VW Joints with 12
Point Socket Head bolts (VW 113 501 229 D).  Just use an 8mm socket on the
other end.  Works great!

See this link to see what it looks like.  Most FLAPS and even Sears carry
this tool (Sears is where I last saw them a few weeks ago).

&gt; I bought a new cv boot kit from bus depot.  I am having trouble finding
&gt; the
&gt; correct socket for the new bolts.  Checking out the library, it says it
&gt; uses a
&gt; &quot;tri-square&quot; socket.  People in my little town look at me like I'm crazy
&gt; when
&gt; I tell them it's not a Torx...&quot;yeah but it will work&quot;...
&gt; I will probably have to order this one on-line.  Just wondering if there
&gt; is a
&gt; source and what size I should order.
&gt; Thanks for the help.
