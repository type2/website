&gt; True, the Dells have no chokes but they don't need them - mine start
easily in 20 degree weather and idle smoothly within a few seconds.
&gt;
&gt; True, the Weber will start because of the choke but it will bog down
within seconds from icing.

A logical perception, but dooms the trade to fail :)
Engine longevity may suffer from carbs washing the
pistons with excess fuel. Increased fuel consumption
is a factor for operating cost as well. Not to mention the
higher power output, placing humans at risk of a crash!
G forces, whiplash, blinding speed, mistaken for a UFO !
Those carbs are just plain dangerous :)
