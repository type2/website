	The classic 'runs for a while then dies, starts right up 20 minutes
later' story is because of a clogged fuel filter, sticky float/valve or some 
other fuel system component- bottom line being that fuel isn't *quite* 
delivered to the carb as fast as its used, while running at speed, so the 
carb slowly goes empty. Confusingly, the flow IS enough to idle. Forever.

	So definately check for a gas smell after it dies. You shouldn't
need a helper for that, if it dies, crank for 15 second &amp; pump the accelerator
a couple of times. Assuming it didn't catch and run, step back to the rear
and sniff your nose up to the tail-pipe, approacing FROM THE SIDE. If there's
gas you'll smell it. Its not a subtle thing. 
	(extra credit- a VW Bus gets 20 mpg, at 3000 rpm, idles at 1000
and cranks at 200. 64 ounces to the gallon. How much fuel does cranking for
15 seconds use?)

&gt; &gt; From my most recent experience the backfiring DOES indicate
&gt; &gt; a spark problem. Spark is YELLOW and strong? BAAAAAAD spark. Blue-white is
&gt; &gt; what you want.
&gt; 
&gt; How about yellow/white?  I don't think I've ever had a new coil, but I've
&gt; never had this problem before.
&gt; 

Yellow spark sounds wrong to me but your milage may vary. You don't
need a helper to see spark color- use a 19mm wrench or socket and handle
to turn the generator pulley nut. 
	It occurs to me that a clever person would have
a nice, correctly gapped, spark-plug with a wire attached to it that 
could be clipped to ground for this test- just pull one of the
plug leads on the engine, hook-up the 'dummy plug' and watch sparks
until you get tired of it. Of course you'd want to pop the distributor
cap and check which plug wire the dist. was closes to firing and use
that one. Just turn the engine forware and backward, gently of course,
as you would when gapping the points. Spark spark spark.
	An even cleverer person would have the same lash-up with
the right connector or wire to connect to the coil secondary :)

&gt; I forgot to mention that I checked the points.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The problem could be that hot it has no point gap and cold it has a little,
&gt; 
&gt; How would that happen?

The distributor and points warm up and expand. This changes their
physical relationship- the points arms get longer, the distributor
cam gets slightly wider. Depending on the detailed geometry of the cam,
rubbing block and points it might run cold and not run hot. It happened
to me last year with my family (18 month old baby) 100 miles from home.
	It got harder and harder to start as the gap vanished, and the last
two times I ran it before fixing it it started up ok but then expired. At
least the first time it expired it was at the entrance to the place
we were staying, at 10:30pm :( Next morning it started up fine, ran
ok 3 miles to the gas station, where I filled it up, and it wouldn't re-start.
I left the bus on the street, took a cab back, thought about it for a day,
concluded it HAD to be the point gap, reset the point gap with a 
business card folded double and it fired right up.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; or it could be some kind of thermal-sensitive condensor,
&gt; 
&gt; My hope.

Why?

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; or it could be a loose wire with insulation that gets soft and shorts to
&gt; &gt; something when its warm.
&gt; 
&gt; My fear.

There aren't that many wires, and a lot of shorting will leave visible
traces.

&gt; &gt; If you can get a volt meter yeah, measure the drop on the coil primary.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't follow you here.  Sorry, I'm not much use with Elektricity.

Hook the volt meter across the two spade-lug type contacts sticking
out of the coil- NOT the big rubber booted secondary wire. One of the
spadeluggy terminals goes up to the ignition switch, and should read
about 12.5-14.xV relative to the case. That's the 'Hot' primary terminal.

The other primary terminal is connected to a little wire pigtail that
goes from the points/condensor in the distributor to the coil. 

	When the points close they ground the other primary terminal on 
the coil. Current flows from battery to the ignition switch to the hot 
terminal of the primary, through the primary winding in the coil to the 
points, and to the distributor body, to the engine case, transmission case, 
the ground  strap, the body and to the negative terminal of the battery. WHEW!

	Closing and opening the points makes current flowing through
the coil primary start and stop. The current makes a magnetic field.
As it gets turned on and off, the magnetic field expands and collapses.
The expanding and collapsing field induces a current in the SECONDARY
windings of the coil. The secondary has MANY (0ver 1000X) more turns of 
wire than the primary, so where the primary is a nominal 12V, the
secondary is a nominal 20,000V. The current in the secondary is smaller
by the same factor ( less than 1/1000 of the primary current) but 
the point of the exercise is sparks not current. It only takes a little
current to make a spark. What's important is a big voltage.

	So if you hook your volt meter across the primary connectors
(the spade lugs) on the coil, you'll measure 0V when the points are
open and (something) when they're closed. Since the primary current flows
through a lot of wires to get to the coil, and the wires have some
resistance, you won't see 12.5 or 13.5 or whatever the battery voltage
is across the coil- but you should see at least 9.6. If you see less than
9.6 the coil primary windings have probably got some shorts- not
enough separate windings, so too small a magnetic field and the secondary
voltage will be too low. And you get yellow sparks.
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; I'll do the swap thing with another coil I know was working when last used, if
&gt; I get the problem again today.  Condensor first, though I guess.

they're not expensive and it can't hurt. Check over the wires as you do
the swap.

	Good luck!
