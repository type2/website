I saw one parked on campus at the University of Missouri during their
graduation (may) this year.  Maroon would be the best approximation of the
color

&gt; Being Friday and all, I though I'd ask about a bus my father saw on

&gt; This is the best  I can get from my father so details could be wrong.
&gt; It was south of Albany but north of NYC, I'd  guess closer to Albany.

your dad isn't crazy, I've seen it too, but can't offer anymore info, he
was heading one way and I the other on the interstate, think I saw it in
NJ, it was a while ago and at night
