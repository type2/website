It's alive!

It seems that I had done everything right, well, almost everything.

When I hooked the fuel pump back up, I simply reversed the wires.
I'm not sure if the pump was pushing the fuel back into the tank but,
at least we know now that you can hook up the German fuel pump
backwards and not ruin it.

So, right up there with leaving the hose clamp on, which I did
earlier this week as well, I've learned another valuable lesson.

Thanks to everyone for their assistance and guidance,

David
