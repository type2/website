&gt;&gt;I'm thinking that my alignment is all jacked now that I have had the
ball joints replaced.  Any other opinions?  As I said before, the steering
feels very tight now, just misguided.  Toe in? Toe out?  Isn't alignment on
a bus (1976) hard to get done right?  What do you think?&lt;&lt;

Seann,

you most definitely need an alignment. there is a bushing at the upper
balljoint that is used to adjust the camber. it was likely moved when the
upper balljoint was replaced.

call around &amp; see who can do an alignment for you. you don't want to wear
out those tires you recently purchased.

good luck,
