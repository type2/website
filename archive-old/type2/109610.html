&gt; I have not seen the CD.
&gt; The yellow cover 1st and 2nd edition Type 2 manuals were put out by VW,
&gt; NOT Bentley. It appears that Bentley used most but not all the info from
the yellow books when they printed
&gt; their repair manuals.
&gt; Once in a long while the yellow books show up on ebay.
&gt; VW also put out an earlier manual that covered 68 to 70.
&gt; Richard put pics of all the covers here:

&gt; I have the 68-70 manual and the 1st edition yellow cover.
