I have a tale of woe. I'm on the coast of New Jersey(that&quot;s not the 
woe) My twenty year old son is in Yellowstone Park with a dead 1977 
VW bus (Transporter)  He called to say he needs an engine or at least 
some info as to how to save his dream trip to the other coast.  
Anyone in the area of  the town of West Yellowstone Wyomingplease 
contact me so I can contact the wanderer with some good news.  He was 
a little distraught the last time he called.  Parts or service info 
would be appreciated.
