Subject: Timing Is Everything

I have a timing problem that I've never encountered before. I just finished
assembling a 1.8ltr (long block built by AVP) with an 009 distributor, fired
by a Pertronix electronic ignition kit. The distributor is brand new but the
Pertronix kit came off the old motor. It is the correct kit for the 009.

Here's the trouble: I set the timing according to the reccommendation of 7.5
BTDC. It leapt to life on the first try! After a hundred miles or so it
wasn't running so well; checked the timing and it was at about TDC. Reset
the timing to spec, drove some miles, timing now at 16 BTDC. Long story
short, every 50 miles or so the timing has to be adjusted--usually advanced.

Assuming the engine was assembled properly by AVP and that the new 009 is up
to snuff, then the question is: has anyone else had trouble with the
Pertronix Ignition? If I go back to points, can I use the Pertronix coil? (3
ohm) Or should I use the stock coil?

Thanks
