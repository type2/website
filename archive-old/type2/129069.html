&gt;My bus had very bad rust under the windshield when I got it, and there was
&gt;little to no rust inside the nose.  I think the water can drain out the
&gt;bottom, so it does not pool up inside.

There are NO water drains in the lower windshield frame.  This is
why water collects and eventually begins to rust the steel body there.

YOUR bus windshield frame may have drained water quite well,
after the steel had one or more rust perforations in that area.  :-(
