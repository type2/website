&gt;On my 1600 there is a tin-ware tube that pokes up through the main tin ware.
&gt;Underneath it points at #2 piston barrel so air blown by the main fan is heated
&gt;by the barrel and blown back up into the air cleaner.
&gt;
&gt;This doesn't require the standard exhaust, but if the tube is missing could be
&gt;difficult to replace.
&gt;
&gt;The thermostat on the air cleaner is also (on mine) adjustable for when it
&gt;closes the warm air flap.

What do you mean when you say it &quot;points at&quot; the #2 barrel? Is it coming
through the half-bell shaped piece that shrouds the cylinders, or through
the rearmost piece near the pulley? Is the tube the same size as the heater
duct ones? Is this metric or ASE? ;)
