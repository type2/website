&gt;I would also be interested in anyone's ingenious ideas for making the
contents
&gt;of their bus more secure.

have an ugly car.   Faded paint, a dent or two, tatty old curtains.    Leave
old pepsi bottles and food wrappers on the floor.   Some spare clothes, dirty
socks, some dog eared paperback, and empty cigarette packs.   Who'll want to
go in there, there wouldn't be anything worth while anyway.     Don't lock
it, and leave the key in the ignition.
