&gt; Bob,
&gt; are u saying that i have a bad valve??
&gt; 
&gt; what can cause this??
&gt; 
&gt; is this an easy fix??

Unbolt the rocker shaft.
Place a straight-edge across the top of the valve stems.
If the valve in question ( # 2 exhaust ) is 1/8&quot; taller than 
the rest, you are due for a cylinder head rebuild. 
This would indicate a dropped valve seat.
The primary cause is overheating.
The good news is that the valve itself may be fine:)

If the guides are worn, you may want to rebuild both heads.
If the heads need rebuilding, you may want to have a look 
at the bearings If the bearings need replacement, you may 
want a new cam and lifters. And pistons and cylinders.
A new oil cooler. Set of gaskets. Fresh oil pump. etc,etc. :)
