Subject: Re: [T2] Fuse Question...and more electrical problems

&gt; Secondly...i have one fuse that has blown 2 times in
&gt; the last month....(number 2) what could be the cause?

If your wiring is intact fuse 2 looks like it is taillights turnsignals
and the license light. Maybe an intermittent short in one of these
circuits, chafed wire or a problem at one of the sockets.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; And lastly...this past week my headlights have refused
&gt; to work on low beam...flip to high, work
&gt; everytime....any sugeestions??

could be bad contacts on the relay, less likely could be fuses or lamps
but then it would have to be both.
