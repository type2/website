Subject: Re: [T2] Slip Streaming a Semi on I-95

&gt;First one--I'm on the way to Salina Ks. to see my Dad--in a yellow 73
&gt;bug ragtop--and I did have a CB it--
&gt;Anyway I'm sucking up on a 18 wheeler's ICC bumper--as he's flying at
&gt;80---and this is for miles--
&gt;He didn't care one bit--but brought one thing to my attention--
&gt;&quot; Hey there pregnant roller skate--I don't care if your sucking
&gt;bumper--that`s OK-- we'll make good time wherever your going--but just
&gt;think of this--what if one of my caps on my trailer lets loose--you'll
&gt;be eating it&quot;--
&gt;I backed off--just couldn't see eating a ribbon of a 10.00 x 20 cap at
&gt;80.

We did this for about 75 kms in Italy on the Autostrada south of Naples. We 
had a big Mercedes car in front and a big BMW car out back. The highway was 
hilly, bumpy old concrete (expansion joints) with concrete walls on each 
side of the single lane (much of it was being reworked).

We were running in the dark and 115 - 130 kph and me in a little 40 HP 
Super Beetle. I just kept my foot on the floor the whole time. I was half a 
car length off the front car's rear bumper and the Beemer about the same 
off my rear bumper. We flew... The car might have mustered 75 mph on flat 
ground with no wind. Amazing how much drafting would help the car maintain 
it's momentum. The engine only had to push the car along and not the wind too.

Thank god nobody rubbed a barrier because we'd been like pinballs bouncing 
around. Come to think of it - maybe they were Mafia running from Sicily to 
Naples.... Wonder who they thought I was (I kept Naples plates on my 
vehicles versus the oh-too-obvious America Forces Italy (AFI) plates that 
attracted thieves like a magnet... )

It was a rush but a single man's game. Those Italians are serious drivers...
