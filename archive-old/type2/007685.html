Hi, Don,

I must admit I haven't been following this thread but I just happened 
to read your last post.

Same thing happened to me when I did a rebuild per the Wilson book. 
But my case was a type 1. I can't see how a type 4 case would be 
different in that regard.

I was lucky in that by discussing the problem with my mechanic I was
able to quickly determine what went wrong and had the bus running the
next day. Maybe if I'd read your earlier posts, I might have been able
to help you. Oh well.

But it's interesting that we both followed Wilson closely and both 
got the same problem. Next time I do a rebuild I might remember to 
note how, by following the instructions, you can end up with the 
distributor drive out by a couple of teeth. 

If any other listees are in the middle of a rebuild with Wilson at 
hand, see if you can work out where Don and I might have gone 
wrong. Maybe there's some information there to benefit the wider VW 
community.


Ian
