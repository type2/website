Subject: [T2] Any extra 1600 dp's?
Content-Disposition: Inline

Hey all, after spending $350 on tests on my 1600 dp, believe it or not,
the tests came up inconclusive, so i will be in need of rebuilding my
engine, which i really dont have the time for. So i thought i would send
a quick message to the list to see if any of you good people out there
might have an extra decent running 1600 dual port you might want to get
rid of. doesnt need to be a recent rebuild, just something you know
runs, and might get me through a little while while i find the time to
do the rebuild. Really just looking for the long block, and keeping the
weight issue for shipping in mind, but if its got some tin on it, i am
fine with that. I am in eastern PA, so the closer to the east coast you
are, the better. If anyone has an extra they wouldnt mind letting go,
please feel free to email me, and i will get back with you as soon as i
can, damn, i just want to take the bus camping!!! have a great day, and
thanks for your time! Brian
