The Thule system is just high enough for the rack and the two sea kayaks it
supports.  I put the front rack just ahead of the front (raising end) of the
pop top.  Therefore only one rack to remove for pop top op.   I'm happy with
the system.  I do think I'd have gone with Yakima if their towers were a little
higher though.

&gt; I own a 76' Westy and am looking into ordering racks for it soon.  Does
&gt; anybody know for sure if the Yakima 1A Raingutter towers w/ the HiRise
&gt; extension will fit over the fiberglass top when mounting the feet to the
&gt; raingutter and not the pop-top?
