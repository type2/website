Subject: Re: valve feeler gauge

That were I who mentioned a stepped feeler gauge. &quot;Stepped&quot; may have
been a misnomer, however -- the gauges should more accurately (I now
think) be called &quot;go/no-go.&quot; It would be awfully difficult to keep track
of which step one is actually on if one were to use a multi-stepped sort
of feeler gauge, I think.

P.S. Isn't .004 a bit tight, or is that a Type1 engine thang?

&gt; Adjusting valves with my 1776 on the engine stand in the garage, as it is
&gt; at the moment, is a piece of cake. Doing so with the engine in the bus is
&gt; another thing entirely.  For  me, as with most people I guess, the most
&gt; time consuming part is switching back and forth among a set of feeler
&gt; gauges to hone in on the 0.004 one.
&gt; 
&gt; In a recent post, someone alluded to the use of a stepped feeler gauge.  If
&gt; one of these were available which spanned, say, the 0.002 -  0.006 range,
&gt; it sure would be a boon in my corner of the world.
&gt; 
&gt; Do these things exist? Available in a catalog?
