&gt;Sorry, this is simply not true.  Basic maintennance does not Ensure
&gt;anything.  

I'm not talking about basic maintenance. I'm talking about augmenting
basic maintenance to that point necessary to ensure results well above
a basic level. Not perfection, mind you, but improvement, which should
be constant which is the DM.

Parts do fail unexpectedly even when they are replaced at
&gt;sensible intervals.  Carrying spare parts is a smart thing to do IMO, DM or
&gt;no DM.

How many German engineers does it take to replace a light bulb???

NONE, if it was designed, manufactured, installed and operated by
German specifications.

(Thank you to whomever sent that my way this week. I hadn't yet
heard it but it sure as h**l is on point.)

And thank you for the feedback.
