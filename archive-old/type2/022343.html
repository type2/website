Subject: baywindow truck bed wood slats
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

I've just recently taken possession of a 69 single cab. I've had splittie 
trucks and have replaced the bedwood but I can't tell if the bays, 
specifically mine ever had them. So, my question is, were they standard 
equipment even on bays? Does anyone know anyone who is repopping the strips?
