Subject: Re: [T2] 8.5 volts at FI fuel pump - what's up??

Well, reconnecting the loose ground wire at the double relay doesn't seem to
be the answer.  Perhaps I picked up something 1.5 miles back when I filled
up with gas....

One good thing came out of the exposure; I found a .08 amp drain at the fuel
pump, between the brown ground wire coming out of the harness and the
negative post on the fuel pump.  Where else should I look for the
problem/connection??  I can measure this same .08 amp drain at the negative
post  to frame at the battery, key off.

Hints from Heloise #12 - Loose female connector.  If you use pliers on the
female electrical connector to tighten up the grip just a tad, many times
you will push too hard and the female connector will close right up, and you
will have a difficult time getting the female connector on the male.  Or, if
it is old metal like on our buses, the sides on the female connector will
break.

Take a vice grip pliers and finger tighten the pliers on the female
connector.  Then, release the vice grip for a moment, turn the knob on the
vice grip just a half turn, and now close the vice grip on the female
connector.  Not tight enough?? Try again with another half turn.

This procedure prevents using too much force, and limits the length of
travel on the vice grips.
