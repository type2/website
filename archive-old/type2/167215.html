Subject: ridiculous engine pulling question

ok, so I am giving up on my 72 westy for the time being and just gonna fix 
my sons bus, as he turns 16 next month. anyhow the question is this:
Having not pulled an engine in a bus I am wondering about the balance point 
of the motor. I am struggling to figure out how to do this the best and 
easiest way by myself, not having what I would prefer to have in the way of 
a jack. i just have two big floor jacks, but in my experience pulling motors 
in beetles, it is just too much of a pain to balance them on the jack, and 
clearance under the vehicle becomes a problem. Anyone use a cherry picker to 
remove their engine through the top access cover? I am thinking of buying 
one and giving it a try, just not sure if the balance point would be too far 
to the rear to make it work, or should I just go buy some sturdy steel beams 
and jack the car up a good 4 feet? Looking for some practical knowedge 
before i unbolt everything and drop the damn thing on my foot.
thanks
Gerry
