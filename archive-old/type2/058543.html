&gt;..snip.... Opening her trunk, she discovered a briefcase the man had set inside her trunk while &gt;helping her with the tire.  Inside was rope and a butcher knife! 
Upon arriving home she relayed the days events to her husband who
suggested a dinner picnic at their favorite spot overlooking Mountain
Lake. After finishing a lovely dinner, the nights cool air caused them
to retire to his car. They sat awhile listening to the radio, the days
events had slipped her mind completely. The radio dj broke into 'play
misty for me' with an important annoucement &quot;an insane killer had
escaped the local mental hospital, he can be identified by a hook on his
left hand&quot;!!! The days events swelled in her mind and she begged her
husband to drive them to his house. Upon arriving at his house she
exited the car, and screamed in horror. Their hanging on her door handle
was a bloody hook!! At the same moment their teenage babysister came
bursting out of the front door of the house, screaming she relayed to
the couple that the police had just traced the source of threatening
calls to the upstairs phone. when police arrived they found a pyschotic
killer in the attic.

I am sorry... just couldn't resist. I know the meaning behind the
original message is heartfelt and well meaning. But the story smacks of
&quot;Urban Legend&quot; a little too much. Actualy way too much, did a quick
search of the urban legend sites and came up with the following :
Try this link

then click the link to &quot;shopping mall&quot;

While it is important to take caution in our lives and we do live in a
world full of crazies, at the same time these urban legends may provide
the basis for the true stories of people in dire need going unhelped.
Again, I am sure the impetus for relaying this story to us is very well
meant, and I do not mean to embarrass or ridicule the sender.
