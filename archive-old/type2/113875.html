&gt;Details please! I've been chasing charging demons since I got my bus. Last
&gt;fall I replaced my alternator, battery, and tried three VRs and still don't
&gt;seem to get proper charging. It's OK as long as I drive 50 miles at a time -
&gt;but around town I occasionally have to get a jump.

You didn't say anything about voltage, as in what voltage you are seeing at the battery during charging.  Maybe you just didn't include this in your post, but I don't see how you can hope to diagnose your problem without spending a lot of time with the voltmeter.

The solution to your problem is probably as simple as swapping in a newer, solid-state regulator.  But I would hesitate to recommend that until I know what voltages you are seeing from your current system.  I assume you don't want to simply throw money at the problem.  :-)

&gt;P.S. Thanks everyone for the input on the FRS radios. Seems to be the best bet
&gt;is to buy the cheapest set I can find. Avoid GMRS.

You won't hear that from me.  GMRS radios have a longer range than FRS and the prices on them have dropped to where they are affordable.  In my experience, FRS in motor vehicles doesn't work as well as even a poorly set up CB.  GMRS radios can also communicate with FRS radios so I see no reason to consider the lower power FRS, unless you absolutely must have the lowest-priced option.

If you must have FRS, I've seen them for as little as $0/pair after rebate from places like Frys.
