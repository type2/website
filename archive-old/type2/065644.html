Subject: safety

Ok, so first I wanted to look at Eurovan Campers: even drove a brand new one
which would cost $37,500 to buy.  Thought that was totally crazy.

Than I thought, OK I'll get a Vanagon Westy, as new as possible (1990 or 91
maybe).

But you know, I never liked the *looks* of  Vanagons.

So, now I'm thinking, what the hell, why not get a Bus Camper?

But:  my wife is pretty concerned about the safety factor when it comes to
buying an older VW.  The new EV has air bags, etc. etc. etc.  The Vanagon
have some modern safety features too.  But the VW
Bus/Camper???????????????????????????????????

I sure would appreciate feedback on the safety issue of driving an aircooled
VW Bus-Camper.

Also, what might I expect to pay for a really really good Bus-Camper??

Thanks for any and all responses.

Dale
