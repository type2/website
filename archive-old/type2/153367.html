Subject: TOUGH part to find for my 70 Beetle

On the brake pedal assembly, the Mastercylinder pushrod is held on with a
horseshoe shaped clip. Mine has been mysteriously stolen by little German
Elves or the tooth fairy. :-) I have looked all over the web for a replacement
piece, (because I think having the rod stay on there is probably a good thing)
but to no avail. Has anyone spotted one, or have one lying in their parts
heap?? I apologize to the Bus crowd for being somewhat OT, but where there's
bus, there's, usually bug.
Regards,
Courtney
