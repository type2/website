Subject: Cost Effectiveness of Points Replacement Conversions?

It was written of Jim Hayden's post under the same subject line:

&gt;So just what does this mean in English??

Jim writes terrifically funny, informative posts.
He's taking more time and skill in the craft (that's writing) than most anyone on the list right now.
(Jim, make check out to B. Price) 

If you haven't the attention span to read and understand his style, you could tune in to one of our many recurrant &quot;diet&quot; threads that taste great and are less filling.

The commentary-on-commentary posts are getting old volks, and you know who you are. 

I'm over it,

Billy
