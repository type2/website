&gt; Ron,
&gt;
&gt; The fact that you're tuning-in to your client base, and are willing to
&gt; address possible deficiencies/mistakes in a public forum, demonstrates to me
&gt; a higher degree of integrity and customer care, than I've experienced from
&gt; most service industry businesses.  I'm glad to see you respond so directly and
&gt; quickly.

Hear hear!  I also would like to acknowledge Ron Solomon and his efforts to
provide exceptional service to his customers of the Type 2 and other VW
inclined!!!

Together, each offering cooperation and patience , we can achieve a coordination
that can and will work to the benefit of all involved.  What nirvana!

Hang in there Ron, don't give up your struggle.  We NEED you, and the service you
are providing!  Thank you...............
