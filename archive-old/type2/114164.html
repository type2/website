Subject: Re: [T2] Westy Parts compatability

Hi Karl,

The 74-79 canvas and Fibreglass I have seen are identical. But I have 
seen differences in the latching mechanisms and props in the early 
late-bays.

There is a 74 pop-top on my westfakia and the hold-downs are different 
than the later years.

76-79 components are the same, but I wouldn't bet on the 74 and 75 
being identical; I think there was some evolution of components during 
the first 2 years.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt;
&gt; 74 TO 79 USA Westfalia's are the same. The tops will
&gt; swap. [I believe the Vanagon body came out in Europe
&gt; in 79?]
