Volks,

Vitals: 78 Westy Deluxe; recent rebuild; no secondary battery.

In my resto project (read: make everything work the way it should before
making it look pretty), I'm down to making my five-years
ago/previous-to-rebuilt-engine refrigerator work properly.  Especially as
I'd like to cool some brews on a day-camp this coming weekend... Problem: no
power.  Checked with switch to both city (when plugged-in) and from
&quot;battery&quot;.  Now, Petunia doesn't have a secondary, but I don't remember her
ever having one.  Prior to the rebuild, my fridge worked.  In an attempt to
trace the lines from the fridge back, I found two wires (one with an inline
fuse) in the left engine compartment coming through the firewall, near where
the alternate battery would be located.  I remember discovering these wires
during the rebuild, and I subsequently taped them off.

Now, do these wires provide electricity to the fridge?  Can I run them to
the primary battery?  What is the proper amperage of the fuse contained by
the thicker of the two (as mine is distinctly missing) - part
number/description would be helpful so I could order one from Ron.

Oh, I thought that it would run w/o the battery connection if I connected
city power.  I was disappointed to discover that this changed nothing.  The
little red light on the switch panel (for fridge &quot;on&quot;) never flickered...
not being an electrician here, does the battery connection complete the
circuit - meaning, w/o the battery connection, I don't even get cold beer
with city power?

All told, the switch panel is dead.  If I haven't noted the problem above,
where should I start looking??

Many, many thanks.
