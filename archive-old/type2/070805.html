It's a very flat 13mm nut on a short stud in the '75. Not sure about the '79, 
but I bet it's the same or close. Sounds like you're missing the stud. Get a 
short bolt, 8.5 mm x 2cm or thereabouts, I should think, and a split washer, 
and put them in, but make sure you got the dipstick rubber slid on safely 
over the lower dipstick spout and the fan housing connection before you 
tighten. 

The gasket might be messed up, though. You can take the whole oil filler unit 
off to inspect the seal, it wiggles out easily enough. Drain the oil first. 
You can cut a gasket from thick brown paper if you can't get the proper 
gasket from a vw supplier quickly enough. Then put in the new bolt.
