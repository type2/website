&gt;Stock 76 model exhaust system- leaking patches at rusted crossover &gt;pipe
&gt;(imagine that)
I am not sure if I want to ;)

&gt;List,
&gt;Couldn't seem to find this directly addressed in the archives in the time i 
&gt;have available.  I am assuming the little bits of wet soot being spit out 
&gt;of the tailpipe at
&gt;idle are unburnt hydrocarbons which means i'm running rich.
Does it go away after the engine warms up?
Might just be some oil burning at startup or water/condensation
in the exhaust.

&gt;A local hot-rod tinker-er suggested installing a less restrictive &gt;exhaust 
&gt;system would help to remedy this.

I will admit that i'am no expert on this but, I would
think that would be a waste of money. Sorry to be blunt
I don't believe the OE exhaust is that restrictive though.

&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;Questions:
&gt;1. Am i running too rich?
Sounds like it, adjust the idle mixture see if the problem
goes away.
I'd also check the timing and dwell to make sure its correct.
&gt;1. Will a less restrictive exhaust cure it?
don't think so
&gt;2. Is this system http://www.motorworks_dot_com/images/p13172B.JPG less
&gt;restrictive than a stock system?
&gt;3. Isn't running a little rich OK  in a vw - esp on a type4?
dont know but cant be good i would imagine, I'd fix it

Save your money on the exhaust unless its has some
major holes you cant repair, you well have other things
to spend money on haahah

Good luck,
Alex Wisniewski
