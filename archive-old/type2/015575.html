Ok, you have one testamonial that says yes. Now get three more. It will
take more than testamonials to convince me. If someone says that's a good
thing to do, I want to see their data. If it's not substantial, color me
pure dino per the owner's manual.

Now, you can find on the shelf just what your talking about, part
synthetic/part dino already mixed. They're called semi-synthetic. As far as
I'm concerned, I haven't yet seen any data that says that won't cause a
problem with 30 year old air cooled designs. I tend to disregard claims for
extended change intervals as well, most certainly since they tend to be
addressing late model water-cooled designs, a very different kettle of fish
with different metalurgy, clearances, seal materials, ignition with twice
the snap, very clean running feedback electronics, yada, yada. 

If you keep notes and get good results, you'll know who to thank. If you
keep notes and have poor results, you'll know who to blame. If you don't
keep notes, you can't prove diddly, and won't know, but can only testify as
to your unknowledgeable opinion, which I will disregard with all the other
guesses flying around. 

Half of what we buy in America is prompted by sales ploys and claims to
create the perception of value where nothing whatever exists as proof of
any value whatsoever. Charletanism runs amok amungst us. Learn to recognize
it in the shortest time possible so it can be truly ignored all day long
and for the rest of your life. Teach your children. Eliminate the value
drain of unproven claims and testamonials. 

If that counterman is an engineer, let him show you the data that proves
his claims. If you have the facts to prove better results, you don't need
an ad campainge. Those lusting after earned profits will find you as soon
as the data is published and see that the demands are met. Know also even
if the data says it's twice as good, the marketing branch will claim it is
three times as good.

I think a hula dancer on the dash is more appropriate if you simply must
have a silly need for same to make it your bus. It doesn't cost much to
give the value desired. A Plastic Jesus could be found for a dime at a
garage sale. I smile every time I see a Garfield on a window. I don't know
why, it is truly involuntary. What is the value of many thousands of
smiles?? Certainly more than $9.95.

But changing the lubrication specs to something unknown when the motor was
designed can be likened to a shot of designer drugs for the life blood of
the machine, and the risk of the long range costs can be substantial. They
are for sure unknown, unless there's been some real data offered in one of
the many great and many publications I haven't seen. I know the
testamonials are full of mixed results. 

The only thing you need for the T-II is any current brand name manufactures
dino. There is more than enough data to prove that works very well indeed,
if you change it by inspection. If it's black and feels like pumice, your
way too late. Reduce your interval by half. That's what will guarantee
longest life for bearings and valves and gears and such. Changing too soon
is far more frugal than changing too late, in the long run, down the road.

It was a good question to ask, Jim. Find out what you can for sure before
you spend your money.
