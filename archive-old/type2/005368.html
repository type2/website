Thanks to everyone who had words of advice on my sheared off studs.  I think
I can get the better of that problem.

Now, I sheared those studs off to get the heat boxes off.  They are both
moderately rusted away.  I know I SHOULD replace them (and cry once,
celebrate every time it snows), but... anyone have a good trick that holds
up for resealing the rusty gap between the sheet metal and the in/out spots
of the exhaust  pipe?  The valves are fine, only one other hole.  Is it too
hot for that rust stabilizing paint to keep up?
