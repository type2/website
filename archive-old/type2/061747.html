I told some folks a while back I would post a detailed account of 
my dealings with this company-- I haven't because my blood 
pressure gets real high and I can't use a keyboard cause I'm so 
pissed off.. But anyway I got screwed in a big way and will never do 
business with them and will tell anyone who asks what happened.
The funny thing is I did get a core refund that I thought was fair.
PS I have heard from a couple of you out there already-- anybody 
else interested in the Class Action suit?
&gt; 
&gt; I don't want to start a bad thread, but has anyone else had a hard time
&gt; getting a refund for cores sent to MSHP?
