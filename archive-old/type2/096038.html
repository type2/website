&gt; &gt; they set the air presure up too high and the guns were torqueing the wheels on to the hub at over 200ft/lbs.   the lug nuts were snapping off.!
&gt; Hmmm- 80 ft lbs -  I gotta stand on the sliding handle to get off the
&gt; nuts sometimes- a lot must be too tight (of course there is friction
&gt; involved here- who greases their lug nuts)?  I don't stand on them to
&gt; tighten, but do give it an &quot;umphhh pull/push until I hear that &quot;creak&quot;. 
&gt; So a 16&quot; grab on a sliding handle needs at least 60 lbs of &quot;umphh&quot;
&gt; applied.  If you pull up that's like picking up a bag of cement- ok for
&gt; those with good backs- others, I'd say make sure you are setting to pull
&gt; down and even step on it if you only weigh 110 lbs!  I never let them
&gt; use  an air tool on installing rims BTW, I specify hand tighteni&gt; &gt; 233K mi on original engine!  ______/__\|         63 panel camper
