&gt;&gt; Check Bentley. Where are the specs for this off idle spring adjustment??
&gt;&gt; Not there, ergo, not proper. The only spec is for setting at idle.

The fact remains that it is the A/F under load that is important to the health of the engine, not the spec at idle.  Just because a spec for 2500rpm at 1/2 throttle isn't in Bentley doesn't mean that it isn't important.  You can bet that VW has specifications for A/F under load even if they don't share them with us.

&gt; The only
&gt;&gt; resolution for the dicked with or worn AFM is a new unit from Bosch.

Spoken like a true modern-day mechanic.  Scott is an intelligent person trying to learn something about his bus and optimize it's performance.  You don't have to help him, but at least stop hammering him for it.

&gt; But
&gt;&gt; that's only if you want it to run right with no repetitive trial and error
&gt;&gt; guesswork.

No guesswork involved with a dyno - it's factual data under conditions that matter(tm).  Your engine isn't going to overheat and throw a rod at idle, even if your A/F is way, way off.

&gt;That unit new costs almost 400 dollars. If all that has been done (in the

&gt;and engine analyzer can fix it. You don't need the VW specs (at RPM's other
&gt;than idle) to tell if the combustion is good.

Agreed.
