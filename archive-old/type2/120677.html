&gt; I'm glad you brought this up. My 70 Adventurewagen bus probably had
bias ply tires on it when new. I run 185R14 Reinforced Contis on it, and
my speedo(according to Jamie Rivers) is out by like 7mph- When it reads
55, I'm actually going like 62mph. It's no big deal, but I wish there was
a different speedo drive gear you could buy to make it right.(I know
there isn't any such animal)

The only change that could fix such a problem would be an in-line gearbox.

VW speedos aren't known for accuracy anyway.  If you're only a few percent
off, count yourself lucky!

George &lt;--75 indicated is 62 actual.  Makes me feel good!
