Gary Gardner, VVWCA Hawaii Chapter Rep

BUS I OWN:

   1978 Kombi

WHERE I LIVE:

   USA; Hawaii; Hilo, on the Big Island &quot;Hawaii&quot;


	Wanted to use this way of introducing myself to the T-2 folks. Some of
you guys know me from other lists. It's been a while since I had a Bus,
but a good deal came my way yesterday, and I had no current project,
so... you know the rest. I am used to older iron, but the chance to tear
into a pancake with fool injection seems intriguing to me.  I am sure I
will have questions as I go along. I'll probably lurk for a while till I
get the feel of the culture here. Haven't decided how I will restore
this 78 yet... original vs slight custom. I've always been an &quot;original&quot;
kind of guy, not being to very fussy if I can get good repro parts... vs
spending 50x as much for NOS.
	If you are interested in seeing my latest resto, it's a T-1 so don't
look if that will offend you  :-)  , it is at:

	Aloha,   Gary
