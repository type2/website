Subject: Re: [T2] the thing between the fan and the crankshaft

&gt;The fan has been unbolted from the thing it bolts to (three bolts) and
&gt;the bolt/big washer thing has been removed from the end of the
&gt;crankshaft.  Now I can't remove the aforementioned thing the fan bolts
&gt;to.  I've tried banging it from behind with a hammer while prying the
&gt;other side with a screw driver and I've tried a light duty puller but it
&gt;doesn't seem to have moved at all.

It's called the hub.

It's only on with 30 ft. lbs. but there is a huge washer there and after all those miles you may need some machine shop assistance to get it off.
