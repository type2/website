Melissa,

We have used wiper motors that sell for $75. I can have one in the mail for
you tomorrow. We guarantee all of our products for 30 days. I know that
pulling parts off of old buses is fun. In fact that's what I do every day.
We have 15 buses on the lot currently, and thousands of square feet full of
parts that have been pulled from buses over the last 18 years. So if you
want to find a part in you local yard it may be a little cheaper, but if you
don't have any luck or maybe don't have a junk yard in you area, well, be
sure to think of us.

lots of luck, let me know if you find one

&gt;          2) buy a used one

same answer

&gt;          3) spend 3 gruelling hours in a junkyard for one

probably your best bet

&gt;          4) rebuild my current one
