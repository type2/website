Subject: Re: [T2] Masonry Sand?

&gt; I just got an Eastwood &quot;Blast out of a Bucket&quot;.  Looking through the
&gt; literature, there is mention of using masonry sand as a blasting media
&gt; which sounds just great to me however, will that be  acceptable for
&gt; cleaning up body panels and such?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance,

I'm assuming (sorry, Felix...;-) that Eastwood's is probably the same
as Sears' and H. F. ...Looks like a big aluminum pistol with a rubber
hose...?
If so, I've got one of the Sears models. I tried it with my 2hp com-
pressor and it &quot;worked&quot; just barely. I used children's sand box sand
and the blaster was OK as long as the sand was Sahara dry...Any
moisture in the sand and it stopped... YMMV, of course
