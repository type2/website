Subject: Re: [T2] Spark !

AT LAST !

Well, after my roundabout problem solving method and the help of the 
listies (The Problem really being solved with the Help of y'all) my bus 
is running like a dream.
Stronger than she has ever been.

I suppose that is to be expected after cleaning the carbs and fuel 
system, new fuel lines, new filters, new vacuum hoses, new plugs, new 
plug wires, new coil, new battery ... and then actually solving the 
problem by setting my points (It was a little tight),  new condenser, 
cap and rotor ... oh and of course getting the timing right  (That one 
had me for a sec, the old, &quot;NOW WHAT?&quot;)

I guess I would'a needed to do all that eventually eh ? &lt;grin&gt; Its such 
a luxury having a super well stocked VW shop in town.

I now know HEAPS more about my bus ... &lt;whew&gt; it was a long day, more 
so due to having to clean the garage to appease a certain little lady 
who couldn't understand why I was in the garage all day.
&quot;Look honey I was cleaning the garage ALL DAY!&quot;

So, thank you all for your kind advice and help ! It was a bum 
condenser, how silly.

My Safare is back on the highways in the rockies, I think I will take 
the bus and head out biking, climbing and kayaking tomorow ! &lt;grin&gt;

Steve,
Havoc is indeed the coolest thing my parents ever gave me.
