Subject: Winch

I'm looking to purchase a winch for my bus.  I guess it would have to be
electric or hand-powered, given that the engine is on the opposite end
(although I suppose I *could* mount it on the back) but I was wondering
about just that:  Where to mount it?

I could probably drill holes in the front bumper for a mount, but the 
last thing
I want to do is mount it somewhere that's gonna cause damage when
i put load on it...

Does anyone have any thoughts on this?  Has anyone done this before?
Would a rear mount, ala trailer hitch work better?

Something I'm also considering is just getting a second bumper and 
modifying
that with a roo bar and a winch so I can have my &quot;nice, stock&quot; bumper and
my &quot;off-road&quot; bumper.

For those of you who cringed at the thought of taking my bus &quot;off-road&quot;, 
I don't
mean for my bus to be a 4x4, taking mud-pits and swamps, but it would be
nice to take dirt tracks, passes, and rocky roads and have a winch to 
sort
me out in the case of emergency.  I've taken low-clearance vehicles, 
i.e. my
Honda CRX and a 4x4 Toyota Tercel Wagon, places that people thought were
only accessible with a high-clearance 4x4 -- without even grazing my 
underbelly,
so don't get too concerned...  Who knows, I'll probably use the winch 
more helping
pull other folks out of ruts than myself!

cheers,
	t
	'71 bus
