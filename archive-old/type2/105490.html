&gt;Most of the cars on the road match the bumper height of the bus relatively

In my particular &quot;microclimate,&quot; most of the other cars are the biggest
SUVs available--all less than three years old.

&gt;I really doubt that the spares made that much of a difference.  A wheel is
&gt;a very rigid object for its mass and doesn't really make that good of a
&gt;&quot;crush space&quot;.

Well, like I said, in the accident with my Thing(tm) that just wasn't the case.
The wheel on the front crushed severely, absorbing quite a bit of impact
energy.  The tire absorbed more, until the bead came off the crushed rim.

&gt;  A tire on the hood of a thing is more likely to be pushed
&gt;through the windshield into the faces of the passengers than it is to
&gt;cushion an impact.

Also not true in my case.  The compaction of the front of the car stopped
at the tire on the hood, the tire absorbing what impact energy remained.
The hood also did not &quot;shove straight back and cut the driver's head off,&quot;
as I have heard repeatedly.

&gt;The dynamics of energy absorption during a crash are very complex.  Just
&gt;putting an object between you and the colliding vehicle doesn't always
&gt;help matters.

I'll take my chances that it doesn't hurt any.

The Thing(tm) has much more crumple-able stuff out front than a bus,
so I'm not really sure how much good a front spare will do the driver
of a bus.  It's also nice not to sleep cuddled up with a tire...........
