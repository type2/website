Subject: Oil temp sender in sump plate (was &quot;Snake oil or real product&quot;)

Talking about drain plugs, it's a PITA to have a oil temp drain plug.  
Anyone
know where to get the oil pressure relief plug version?


First question is do you have a filter on the engine? If so, just remove the 
strainer. You will eliminate the problem of interference with the metal 
plate. There is much debate about the merits and risks of removing the 
strainer, but I have run 25,000 miles on my Type 1 without it and not had a 
problem - and the builder, who is much respected around these parts, 
endorsed my doing so (as did the late Gene Berg, if I remember right).

There is a possibility, very remote, that a valve keeper or some such small 
piece of metal could get sucked into the oil pump. I say very remote because 
it would have to get sucked UP the pickup tube, which is unlikely. The 
suction there is actually quite low, not enough to pick a chunk of metal up 
off the sump plate an inch below it - which, incidentally, is another good 
argument for removing the strainer. If you neglect to clean that thing and 
it gets clogged, pump output will suffer drastically. Oil pumps are very 
strong on the output side but comparatively weak on the suction end - in 
fact they will produce no suction at all when dry, which is why a new pump 
must be primed with grease or oil during installation.

IMHO, as long as you're running a filter (you are, aren't you?) you're 
better off without the screen. And your oil temp sender will work better as 
well, because you will improve circulation in the area of the sender by 
removing the screen.

I haven't heard of the pressure-relief location for mounting a sender, but 
would be interested to hear about anyone's experience with it.
