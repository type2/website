Subject: questions about heads

Hi volks,

Well if anyone has had a head job on a type 4 lately I need some advise.

I just ordered a set of rebuilt heads about $180 a piece for a type 4 1776
from Bus Depot.  I asked about new and they said they refuse to sell new
because of an inherrent problem that VW never fixed with dropped valve
seats.  Is this a real problem? Well the ones Bus Depot sent ended up being
from AVP and arrived cracked where the exhaust port goes thru the head. Not
to mention after paying 2nd day air it arrives a week after I ordered it.
Has any one else dealt with AVP before.  My mechanic took one look at the
heads and refuses to warranty my new complete rebuild because of these
heads(even if I change out the bad one.)  The ones he uses he says are new
from Germany and are $500 a piece.  But then that goes back to the original
problem that Bus depot says about the originals...
Who is right?
TIA
Peace

Snoopy
Any and all responses will be appreciated as my engine is in a hundred
pieces and still waiting on a cam.
