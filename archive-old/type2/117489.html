&gt; well wife and i were talking and wondering?
&gt; 
&gt; well at first we have always talked about doing something to the top
&gt; of the bus...?
&gt; 
&gt; never been sure so i want to ask a question&gt;?
&gt; 
&gt; can we have the roof cut if we were to find a pop top and have it
&gt; installed... i mean thats all it is anyways right&gt;? done like that
&gt; from the factory in pop tops?

well not really some (I try never to say always) have had the undersides
reinforced, and the shape of the roof is flatter on the later poptops

&gt; just thought one day it would be nice to have a little more room up top...
&gt; that would be great for camping...

could do it the way my bus is, instead of raising the top, lower the
bottom, mine is HPBus modification which lowers the floor between the
wheels about 10 inches....some photos on the Everybus web site
