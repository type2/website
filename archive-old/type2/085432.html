Subject: Re: [T2] Upcoming trip

Where do you live?

&gt; Hello,
&gt; I'm new to this mail list and to the Volkswagen phenom. I've just purchased a
&gt; '78 Westfalia and am picking it up next week. My wife and I fly to Denver from
&gt; our home in Michigan and will meander our way back home slowly. My question
&gt; is; are there any interesting places to go or see on our way back? We have
&gt; four daze to make the trip and have considered Memphis, Santa Fe, and St.
&gt; Louis. Any help from people who've made this trip or lives somewhere in
&gt; between would be greatly appreciated. FYI, I've purchased a new copy of John
&gt; Muir's book and a good road atlas. Hopefully, I won't need the former. Oh
&gt; yeah, I love this list and you all seem like a great bunch of people.
&gt; Richard
&gt; new '78 Westy (no name yet)
