&gt; I'm rebuilding a1600DP and I'm about to bolt on the three intake manifold
&gt; sections. The center section has a tang that is secured to the case using
&gt; an existing extra long stud.
&gt;
&gt; When I joined the case halves, I put a nut on that stud and torqued it to
&gt; spec.
&gt;
&gt; At this stage,  doo I remove that nut, slip the manifold tang over the stud
&gt; with its face against the case, and then secure this with the nut?  Or do I
&gt; slip the manifold tang up against that nut and add another nut to the stud
&gt; so that the tang is sandwiched between these  two nuts?

Remove the nut and put the manifold up against the case.
