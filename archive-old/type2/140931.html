Subject: Re: [T2] How difficult is welding ?

Welding is not that difficult, the more you do it the better you will get.
No book or video will make you a good welder, only practice will. However, a
book or video will get you started in the right direction. I never welded
before I bought my mig welder, I read the manual that came with it and
started with some scrap metal. I'm 3 years into it and still can't weld a
nice looking bead, but that's what a grinder is for. As long as there is
good penetration. Buy a good welder (Lincoln Electric or Miller to name 2),
that will make thing easier ...nothing worse than a cheap welder! Replacing
heaterchannels is a pretty big task. I'm going be doing it next month to my
friends 63 Beetle as well as the pans and the bulkhead. Should be fun!

Here are some sites for tips:
