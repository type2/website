Hello All,

Some people convert from AC to DC, others from Catholic to Protestant, I 
converted from 'Digest' to 'Mailing list'. 

I've spent the last 6 months digging through the archives and digests to 
build myself a pretty comprehensive FileMaker reference DB on my Mac Duo 
PowerBook. It travels with me when on the road with 'Pegasus', my '75 VW 
bus, which I converted to 'overnighter' when I first bought it, 6 years 
ago. 

The PO apparently had some problems with the auto transmission because he 
replaced it with a standard 4 spd ten years ago and it is holding up 
well. Apart from that everything is stock, including wear and tear, but 
because of good climate, there's virtually no rust.

There's a lot of work that needs to be done on 'Pegasus' and I already 
found many cures in the digests and archives. But, as always, there will 
be many other questions so I'm sure I will be calling on you folks one 
time or another.

About myself, I'm a single, retired graphic designer, college teacher and 
manager (12 yrs ea.), originally from Holland, lived all over, but 
settled on Northern CA in '74, when the roads were still 'wide open', 
apricot orchards still covered the valley, and the prices of housing, 
food, and wine were still reasonable.

Yes, I have to admit, we didn't have any brewpubs then, but always had 
Fritz Maytag's Anker Steam Beer, so we didn't suffer too badly.

Of course, things have changed so starting this fall I'll be spending at 
least part of the year South of the border to stretch my fixed dollars 
and at last go and do things *I* want to do such as writing short stories 
and photography. In another 3 or 4 months I should be ready to roll with 
a reliable bus. 

If there's anything I can help anybody with feel free to call on me 
anytime.

PS. Jan stands for 'Jan' and not for 'Janice', is Dutch for 'John'; yes, 
I get offers for pantyhoses in the mail but should mention that I have to 
shave every morning. That is, my face, not my legs. 




Good, better, best:...The box said &quot;Windows 3.1 or better,&quot; so I bought a 
Macintosh.
