Subject: Re: [T2] Cruisin CB channels for monitoring

&gt; Would someone be able to advise on which channels I should monitor on the CB

Truckers frequent Ch 19, though they often use other channels on specific
highways.  Bus folk monitor Ch 2 on both CB and FRS

&gt; I am going to match my AM Antenna whip to CB using a tuner that allows the
&gt; continued use of the AM/FM radio as well. 35 smackers for the cheap little
&gt; box.

Don't expect great performance from that setup!

&gt; Also going to put in a &quot;thru the glass&quot; 2 meter ham radio antenna.

Those work well if installed carefully.  Be sure to comply with the
&quot;distance from metal&quot; specification in the instructions and clean the
glass very well before installing.

My antennas (CB, HF and VHF) are mounted on my roof rack.  You can
get a wire to the roof rack with no visible holes by going into the engine
bay through a hole behind the spare tire and then up through the air vent
to the roof rack.
