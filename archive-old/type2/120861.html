&gt;As a preventative maintenance procedure while my engine is out...
&gt;I found the filler neck to tank hose cracking. The hose is removed and 
&gt;sitting on the bench...I called local VW parts house and they don't have it 
&gt;available...

I almost found one at a VW dealer in Abbostford during my last trip to Canada. Their inventory lied but if I had found one, it would have been $135 CDN. I'm glad I didn't find it.

&gt;Okay to use regular fuel neck hose from Napa that is straight without a 
&gt;manufacture bend...This hose seems flexible/plyable enough or do you think it will 
&gt;kink too much? I guess the best thing to do is try. 
&gt;Although the hose they sell at Napa does seem to be a little stiffer...Anyone 
&gt;found a new molded one?

When I fixed my tank in March 2002 I went to NAPA for hose also.  I bought:

1055 NBH GAS HOSE $16.49
705-1019 BK HOS CLMP $1.19 (each x 3)

I simply cut the ends at an angle to approximate the bend. 1 ft  is enough for one cutting mistake of 2 1/4&quot; fuel hose. 

I wrote down the info printed on the hose for reference:

080401 GAS EBP 78CN25
