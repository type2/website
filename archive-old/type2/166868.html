i was insured with allstate when my bus burned down. initially they offered my
$3k, but on clara's insistence, i put a package together with photos,
comparative ads in thesamba_dot_com, and they sent it off to a special vehicle
evaluator. he said $8.5k plus the sales tax, so i got a bit over $9k.

do you have photos and receipts?

&gt; I was cruising down the road on Saturday in my &quot;new&quot;

 MPH!! The good news is that me, my wife, and my
 stepson were all un-injured,
thank god everyone is ok, what about the &quot;stupid teenager&quot;??
uses are tougher than they look, eh?
&gt; HOWEVER, the bad news is
 that the nose of the bus got CRUNCHED!!!! Probably not
 fix-able
well I wouldn't give up oon it so fast. might surprise you, let someone
ike the Metal wiz give you an estimate to take to the insurance company.
&gt; :-(  So now I have to fight with this kid's
 insurance company to try to get a fair settlement and
use the &quot;antique and classic&quot; car list of values and the Samba list not
ust kelleys blue book that they will try to use. I've had that fight with
omeones insurance company and it is winable.
&gt; buy another bus.  Soooo, anybody got a decent bus for
 sale near the Midwest or Southeast??  I'd prefer a
 68-71 westy but will consider all.  Does NOT have to
 have a running engine (I have 2) but I'd like it to be
 otherwise road-worthy with a decent body.  I live near
 Cincinnati, Ohio but will travel for the right deal.
 Depending on the insurance settlement, I may have only
 a few grand to spend. Sooooo, can anyone help out a
 long-time bus brother?!?!?
 PEACE! John Baker
hopefully in the light of day it might just need a new nose and front
its, especially if the vehicle has no damage past the front torsion
ubes.
good luck and glad everyone is ok,.... what your neck is sore??? sorry
ouldn't resist
