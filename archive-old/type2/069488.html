Subject: Overalls, tools etc.

I'm getting serious about this mechanic thing now...

At the weekend I bought a German Airforce ('Luftwaffe') navy 
boiler suit to use as overalls. It is a *cool* suit!!! I want to get a 
pale blue VW emblem printed on the back. The guy in the Army 
Surplus store wanted to sell me a huge German WW2 battle 
flag with a giant swastika on it. He thought it would look great 
flapping from the back of my bus.......... 

Tomorrow I'm picking up the 10, 11, 13 &amp; 17mm BRITOOL 
spannersn I've ordered as I'm fed-up of bendy cheap Halfords 
(do you have this attrocious chain in the States?) ones.

Although my Dad is too scared to ride in the Split and keeps imploring
me to buy a Golf, he has given me his old Britool torque wrench for 
my birthday, which according to my local tool shop is worth Quite Alot 
of Money. Sadly it hasn't come in all that useful yet as the lowest
setting is 20ftlb.
