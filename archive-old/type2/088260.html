Subject: Re: [T2] Push rod tube seals.

Doug,

     Pull the valve covers, pushrod retaining wires &amp; rocker arms.  I always
layout the pushrods so they go back to the same position.  Pull the tin that
is under the pushrod tubes.  After that, take a vice grip &amp; gently grasp the
pushrod tube.  DO NOT crush it.  Twist &amp; pull in the direction of the head
until its out.  You will see the seals.  Replace all with new VITON seals.
Oil them up a little &amp; reinsert them.  Make sure that the seal does not get
pinched as you are putting the tube back in.  Also make sure that the tube
is fully seating in the case.  Replace the rest &amp; rock on.  I would adjust
your valves if not hydraulic.  Hope that helps a little.

I am thinking of putting in my own push rod tube seals in my 1700 cc engine,
how difficult or easy is this job?

Thanks
