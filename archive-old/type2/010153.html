Hi all,
   Since we'll be driving to Transporters by the Tunnel on Friday I'm 
posting this today.  I'm wondering if any list members in the state of New 
York would want to get together for an end of summer barbeque?
If there is any interest we could meet someplace central to everyone who 
wants to join in.  If interested P-mail me by replying to this message or 
sending to type2_at_msn_dot_com with your location and what days would be best or 
worst for you
