Well, after pulling the valve covers last week, I found that they all had
clearance!  (new to me'78 bus, 2.0, GE engine, supposedly above the cutoff
for hyd valves)I remember some mention of steel (thin) push rods, but these
were thick aluminium, like my '80 camper.  Also, the #1 adjusting locknuts
are 15mm head?!?!?! #3 are 13mm, like I remember.  This is my first late
'70s bus, (the third is a '69) so I would like some help.  Is there some
more definitive method of assuring myself of the presence of hyd valves?  I
mean, I hear the lifters pump up, I see the sticker on the fan housing that
says-no adjust valves, but someone has set them for clearance. arrgh.
