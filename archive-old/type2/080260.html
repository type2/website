Subject: RE: [T2] synthetic vs. regular oil

I am perplexed by the mixed mentality on synthetic oils. I use Mobil in my
water cooled vehicles but not in my 63 bus because  the experts made a great
argument regarding heat transfer etcetera. However I use Mobil 1 V-TWIN
religously in my Harley's and am convinced this is the right way to go.
Obviously the bikes are air-cooled, so what has Mobil done with the recipe
to make it work? Can this be used in the bus? Wish I had good poop on this
subject.

&gt; i was told by a VW mechanic that synthetic wasn't good for air cooled

exact explanation, but if this isn't true i'd like to know cause i always
read how synthetic is better.


I've been running synthetics exclusively since 1976 and have had no
failures that can be even remotely linked to the oil

many VWs
