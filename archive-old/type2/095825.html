Subject: original westy tent FS

Hey everyone,

We have a perfect original westy tent for sale. This has everything. All
stakes tie downs (have Germany stamped on them) ext. I would put it on the
website but I want to offer it to the list first. This tent has been used
only a few times and has been in good hands for years. It came with a 1974
bus and is in show quality shape. No visible ware. Own one of the best tents
left. I cannot let it go for less than $500.00 plus shipping. That is a bit
more than they can be had on *bay but this tent is too perfect. Please call
me to order.
