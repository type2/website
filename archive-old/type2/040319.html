Subject: Re: More on Mystery Noise

Written...
CA tearing the right rear apart.  Nothing wrong with the bearings--turned
out
all the noise was from the axle nut being loose!  This turned out to be a
recurring problem on that trip.  What we have since come to believe was
the
cause:  cheap Brazilian brake rotors, poorly machined, slightly out of
round
causes slight vibration which loosens nut; others have reported similar
problems with these rotors.
...

The problem is not the nut becoming loose. It cant as it is pinned in. The
problem is that the inner surface of the drum/rotor that thrusts against
the bearing stack wears away from the tiny movement. As it wears the
clearance becomes more and it just increases the wear. Im not sure if this
is caused by worn splines or if it is just a fact of life. Seen it many
times. If I hear any squeaks at low speeds or if I see and sign of the hub
moving against the nut I retorque.
