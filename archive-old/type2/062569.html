&gt;VOLKSWAGEN, 2 crew-cab p.u., rare find. $2500 o.b.o. Digital pgr., [901]
&gt;391-9556.

I went and looked at them; details follow:

These are bay-window crews. One is a 68, the other is a 70. Neither have
engines.

The 70 is by far the better one. It is complete but apart. Body is very
good, paint is completely thrashed. Rust in lower cab doors and rocker
under 3rd door, but I've definitely seen worse rust. This looks to have
been a Southern bus all its life. Cab floors fine. I didn't look under the
bed. Body very straight. All rails extant, one slightly bent, surface rust.
Battery tray gone.

The 68 has been hit hard in the nose and is rustier. Frame is okay,
driver's cab floor rusted through. Probably this is a parts bus unless you
have too much ambition and time. All rails.

All glass, seats and bits are in the bed of the 68; both busses are
indoors. Seats thrashed. Between the two of them there is a virtually
perfect crew here.

The man says he used to drive the 68 and knows the trans is good. Won't
speak to the trans in the 70. He offered a 70 parts bus with a known good
trans for the trans and nose skin, free, but you'd do better to just pull
the trans because the nose isn't that good.

That's all I know. Again, these are in Memphis. I'm not gonna get them. I
got a phone number out of him:
