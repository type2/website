Subject: Re: [T2] Need Better Freeway Gears

 &gt;a popular course of action in this

&gt;case is to go to the 091 (six-rib) transmission as used from 1976-79.  
&gt;You will need to swap over some parts from your current transmission  
&gt;to make this work properly. (Nosecone, bell housing and starter).  
&gt;That will get you about 5% more speed in top gear.

I didn't need to swap the nosecone, just bellhousing, old starter, and trans input shaft is about 1/2&quot; shorter.  I don't have the exact ratios in front of me but my old top speed was about 65mph (indicated).  My new top speed with 091 is about 85mph (indicated).  Someone can probably look up the ratios but it was definitely more than 5%.  Perhaps the reinforced tires added to the effects.

&gt;BUT: Unless you add more torque to the engine you are going to stress  
&gt;it. Hill climbing and accelleration will suffer.  Adding extra load  
&gt;to the engine while at the same time dropping the oil pressure and  
&gt;cooling fan speed doesn't seem like a good idea for long term engine  
&gt;longevity. YMMV.

these are good reasons for a stronger engine.  when I was working on the 
1776 I had a fresh 1600DP for about 6 weeks (thanks to phil cain).  It 
worked OK but with stock power was a little doggy getting up to speed.
