&gt; &gt;How can a caliper with a digital readout be a vernier caliper?  Does it
&gt; &gt;have a auxiliary vernier for when the battery dies?
&gt;
&gt; You know most of them do actually, or did until a short while ago.  The
&gt; Mitutoyo used to have a pretty much standard vernier scale etched on
&gt; the digimatics probably to 0.005&quot; resolution or so.

John gets it in one! This one has a vernier scale etched in as well!

&gt; &gt;I guess I like the old fashioned variety.  Kind of a entrance exam to the
&gt; &gt;trade!

yeah, I guess...  but that is the old slide rule/calculator thing.  I have
a calculator!  I see no virtue in doing it the hard way if I don't have
to.  At this point, I have one of each, a plastic vernier, a dial and the
electronic.  Plastic vernier is for junkyarding... are those pistons 83.5
or 85?  slap the cheap plastic mic on it!  If I lose it or break it, I am
out a whole $4.95! The electronic is for the shop, the dial is for backup.

One additional benefit to this mic is that it comes with a  button marked
&quot;mm/in&quot;  Push the button and you are in metric, push it again and you are
in the arcane Ugandan/US system (I should be fair to Uganda, tho...  I
think they are changing over)
