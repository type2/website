[...]

A chunk of gravel that enters via an adjuster access hole has much the same
effect, and _can_ work its way between the lining and drum under some
circumstances.  Once the shock/panic wears off, its a real pain trying to
drive home with a brake that's trying to lock up intermittently.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  I had one experience with a bus where a standard nut and bolt had been
used to assemble the lever to the shoe.  That nut came off at highway
speed and there was *such* a huge clatter in the rear as that nut banged
around that I came very close to a laundry call :-)  I don't think it
would be dangerous, the nut is way too thick to wedge between the shoe and
drum, but it sure is loud!  &lt;&lt;
