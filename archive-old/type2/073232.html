&gt;It's quite obvious to me that the splitty tried to MOUNT the school bus,
&gt;things then began to go horribly wrong, and the two became permanently
&gt;dissolved (melded?) together.

Yep. You can fix these things with the simple application of a garden hose
if you are alert. They're just stuck. (Gawd what a hideous litter this is
likely to be.)
