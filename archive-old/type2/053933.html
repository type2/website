Subject: engine price?

hello all i have a question, is 400 dollars canadian to much money to
pay a guy to buy his not completely turning over, 2.0L fuel injected
engine? this is canadian dollars now remember. the engine is already out
of what ever it was in. the crank won't turn all the way round. i don't
know how much an engine for a volkswagen micro bus engine is worth and i
don't want to get riped off by this guy, please tell me if you know how
much an engine of this sort should cost over here in canada. thanks
