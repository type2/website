I am at my wits end as to how to get the fan to go onto the fan hub.  It
WILL NOT SEAT on that tit so I can put in the 3 bolts.  The holdup is the
hub itself, not the large or small washer. Do I use a mallet and beat the
hell out of it to seat it, tighten the 3 bolts to &quot;pull&quot; it on, start
sanding the hell out of the hub,... help!!! The three manuals I have just
say &quot;line it up and bolt it on.&quot;  I have found it is not that easy. Just
before losing my composure, I grabbed a beer and consulted y'all.  What is
the trick?  Oh, yeah, engine is out.  Also the hub seems to be stuck on even
though I took the bolt off--I'm concerned with damaging the rear main seal
if I PRY it off.......?
