Subject: Re: [T2] Re: locking gas cap

From: &quot;Jim&quot; &lt;jrasite_at_eoni_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Is fuel theft *really* a problem in Augusta, GA?

Tends on the neighborhood.  In 20 years, I've had only three occurrences
where the gas &quot;evaporated&quot; overnight.  I always replace a gas cap with a
locking one when the cap needs replacing anyway.

The one on &quot;G&quot; was a generic 2&quot; across deal with the finger/thumb tabs
sticking up on it.  Every time that you took it off the tabs bent, and you
gave your wrist a hernia.  It also looked terrible.  The new one fills up
the filler opening and is very easy to remove with the key.  I'm happy.
