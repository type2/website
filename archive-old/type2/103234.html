&gt; &gt;Hello all!  I have been away from this list for several years after selling my
&gt; &gt;78 Bus, but have seen the light and am actively shopping for another.  I have
&gt; &gt;found a 71 Westy that is in decent shape.  But wonder if there are any
&gt; &gt;peculiarities to this year model that I need to be aware of.  Any info
&gt; &gt;appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; I assume you know that this is a Beetle powered bus, has the weaker
&gt; steering system, and the non-removable drums (requires drum and hubs to be
&gt; removed for brake work)?

A '71 does have the worm-and-peg steering box, but it _is_ blessed with
the late-model composite drums.  It is also the first year for disc brakes
and narrow-5 lug patterns.

One-year-only parts include the front engine tin, the intake manifold.
Two-year only parts include the front brake calipers, spindles, and hubs.
