Subject: Free Stuff, will make replies tonight

Hello List,

I just wanted to let everyone know that I will be able
to go through all the emails tonight and figure out
who gets what part and who gets a lump of coal. ;)

Anyhow, I have some personal business to attend to
this after noon but will be able to reply to the
emails and figure out what is left tonight.

Later,

David Kelly
