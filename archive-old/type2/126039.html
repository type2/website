&gt;i was wondering does anybody on the list know where i can get a pair of mudflaps for my 76 bus with the brackets.

If you don't care about the logo about any online vw vendor. For the logo you have to look harder (usually eBay for venezuelan copies).

For the brackets, I don't think anyone sells the proper brackets with mudflaps but Jamie River's drew up some plans to help you make your own. See my mudflap article and the links at the end of it:
