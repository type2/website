Subject: loose damper pipe

------=_NextPart_001_0000_01C1EE05.A10A0480

hello again everyone!  I am in the process of putting together my engine.=
  I have a brand new German muffler, damper pipe, and tail pipe.  Upon at=
taching the damper pipe to the muffler,  I noticed it sits in the muffler=
 a bit loose.  I thought it would all tighten up when I put the new clamp=
 and gasket on it, but it is still a bit loose.  And the clamp is on too =
tight, I know.  Any way to get a better fit?  Thanks  BGGet more from the=
