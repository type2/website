Subject: Re: [T2] Home made 70amp alternator cooling boot

From: &quot;Bruce Maxson&quot; &lt;bmaxson_at_stny.rr_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Looking at this, it appears that I have the 55 amp (D-shaped) boot.  8^(
&gt; It appears that the 70 amp is round on both ends, which is not what I
have.

Bruce, the 70A boot that I was sent wasn't round on both ends, or round at
all along it's length.  It might have been made to fit a round connection at
either end, but it wasn't round itself that I can remember.  I only took a
few minutes to look over the one that I examined.

I sent it back about 5 minutes after opening the box at the USPS because I
wasn't sure that I could repro it at the time.  I've got more experience and
a larger selection of materials now, but can't find a 70A boot to work with.

I'd love to take a shot at it, if nothing else, just to see how well the
resin holds up to the wear and tear of actual use as an engine part.
