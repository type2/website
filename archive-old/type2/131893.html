Subject: Re: [T2] Stupid Elec. Question

I had huge electrical problems with my 70 SC when i first got it, too.

The best thing if you do not already have, is an OLD Bentley that has color
coded wiring diagrams.  Take the advice of the other poster, but check that
wires on relays, on the fuse box, etc are where they should be.  It takes
time, and cleaning a lot of connections (unhook the battery or you are sure
to short something out ) but I found this what just what my car
needed.....PO had wrong fuse box in it, guessed where to hook up wires,
installed radio once, removed radio, and left the wires short to ground,
etc.

Tracing circuits with that color coded book is so much easier........those
old Bentleys even have a little drawing of everything instead of having to
keep referring to the legend to see what Z1 or T5 is............
