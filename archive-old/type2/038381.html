Subject: 009 vs. vacuum advance

Sorry, probably been covered before, but wondering if the electronic
ignition would solve the problems of a 009 on a 1600sp.? I've done some
reading and it seems that the mechanical (009) distributer ruins any gas
milage.  I'm getting 10mpg now. Also this will cause some sluggishness.
Can I use an elec ignition, say pertronix, to counter these things? if
not do they remanufacture the vacuum, or do i have to buy used?

thanks
