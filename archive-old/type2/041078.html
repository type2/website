Subject: Newbie: Carbs and header Questions

Hello everyone! I am new to this list and I have a couple of questions..
Im in the process of rebuilding a stock Type IV for my 76 VW bus.. I have
two big questions that I cant find good solid answers for from the archives:
1. Im getting some dual 40mm IDF carbs and need to know what you guys
reccommend for proper jetting for best daily driveability for the 2000 cc
motor. (ie: main, emulsion tubes, idle etc.. I need to know what to order
with the carbs) Do you guys reccommed the 40s or the 44s more?
2. The motor in the bus now is an 1800 (the rebuilt I am installing is a
2000). I have a progressive carb kit for the 1800.. will the intake manifold
runners and kit fit the 2000 heads w/out modification? I also have a set of
intake runners from a 1979 2000 Type IV with square exaust port heads..
would these intake runners work better/fit? I want to use the progressive
carb kit until my duals come in and are jetted properly.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.. BTW, this is a great list.. I have
been lurking here for a while!
Mike
