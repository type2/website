Subject: RE: [T2] 6-rib transmission swap

Martin,

Richard is right on the parts needed to do the swap. It can be done easily
by yourself if  you get a 091/002 gasket kit from one of the vendors.

I used a '71 Bellhousing, clutch forks, Throwout bearing and input shaft in
a '79 091 tranny. It works well.

However, I wouldn't recommend a 091 in a type 1 motor unless you are doing
the majority of your driving on a mostly flat freeway. The gearing is too
high for a 1776 to do any significant hills. My Double Cab has a
high-revving and high-horsepower 1914. It is still taxed and slow on big
hills due to the Type 1 motor's inherently lower usable torque in comparison
to a Type 4 motor.

But, if you can live with it, you will see slightly better mileage numbers,
a little better shifting and slightly higher cylinder head temperatures. The
temps are from having to lug the motor more and the fan turning slower and
lower RPM's.

Just my 2 cents. Good Luck!

Subject: [T2] 6-rib transmission swap

I usually pride myself on being able to find my answers by myself by
searching
the Internet, but I am at a loss.  (Maybe it is just a Monday.)

I have an 091 6-rib transmission from a 1976 that I want to mate up to a
type
1 style motor.  I know I saw somewhere the how to's and option but cannot
seem
to find them now.

1.  Can you use the existing bellhousing with the 6-rib?
2.  Do you have to shave length off the input rod?
3.  Does the nose cone need to be swapped out?

Any links to info you could provide would be great.

Thanks
