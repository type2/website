Subject: new engine maint. questions

I am finally driving my bus.  After a 5 year hiatus she is finally on the 
road again!  I have a rebuilt 71 1600 DP built by Bob, at Boston Engines.  
She is a beast!  Have done some fairly steep grades at 50 with no pinging, 
and pedal to spare!  Folks, spend the money when you do a rebuild, believe 
me, it is well worth it.  Anyway, I have logged 600 miles on her since 
rebuild.  I have done 2 oil changes since. 1 after initial break in in the 
driveway, and another time when she hit 500 miles.  Valves have been 
adjusted once.  First off, can you change oil too much?  I drive my bus very 
few miles, and mostly around town.  I have the capacity to change it every 
other week.  I figure I will drive about 200 miles a month, mostly in town.  
I would like to change it at least once a month.  It may sound anal, but I 
like to be very meticulous in maintaining my vehicles.  Second,  is it too 
soon to adjust valves?  This is a newly rebuilt engine, and I would like it 
to last.  When assembling, I left nothing to chance.  It was either 
refurbished, or brand new.  Mostly N.O.S.. Also, I have a full Leistritz 
exhaust. All nos.  For some reason, my damper pipe fits a bit loosely in my 
muffler flange.  I tried teflon tape, but it disintegrated, and blew out.  
Anyone else go through this?  Any advice or opinions welcome.               
thank you,
Bus Gypsy
