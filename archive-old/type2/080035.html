Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch cable replacement help

&gt;Replaced the clutch cable in anticipation of new clutch and complete

&gt;the 2 bolts that hold the bracket that holds this tube had stripped the
&gt;holes in the trans or they were simply the wrong size??? Can't see in
&gt;the bolt holes to inspect the threads. The bolts that came out of these
&gt;holes have 8mm threads. Is this correct? Thinking about Helicoil. Does
&gt;anyone know for sure what size and how long these bolts should be?

They are indeed 8mm.  Not sure of the exact length but it's somewhere in 
the neighborhood of 1&quot;.  Those threads stripping is a common problem - 
therefore the result of underengineering (lot of stress, magnesium 
threads).  Helicoil is probably the best bet to fix it, although tapping it 
out to a larger size would work too if you drill out the holes in the 
bracket.  Be careful tapping it - don't drill/tap in too far.  The boss can 
also break off if abused (I've seen two trannies so afflicted).
