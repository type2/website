&gt;I have another question.  Yesterday I drove my 79 for about 3 straight
&gt;hours.  I stopped the engine to unload some stuff, than I tried to start
her
&gt;up again... and nothing happened.  I heard a little hum as I turned the
key,
&gt;but the starter never kicked in.
&gt;
&gt;I had a similar problem called a hot start problem.  Short of waiting about
30 minutes for the engine to cool, I went to the local mechanic who put in a
&quot;hot start relay.&quot;  I don't know what it was but it says BOSCH on it and for
around $50.00 installed it did the trick.  No more filling gas with the
engine running!
