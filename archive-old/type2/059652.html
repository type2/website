Subject: Re: radios, source for

&gt; I have bought several radios from Damark (sp?).  It's a discount catalog
&gt;&gt; with great prices and the warranty on the one radio I had trouble with
&gt;was
&gt;&gt; honored locally with no problem.  I don't seem to have a catalog right
&gt;now
&gt;&gt; but when I get the next one I'll post their phone #.

    I found a catalog.  The listings are different in every catalog, I guess
it just depends of what they have in stock.  This one lists a 140-watt Sony
CD, AM/FM for $199.99 and a Blaupunkt 140-watt AM/FM/CD w/detachable
faceplate for $249.99.  Their address is: Damark International, Inc., 7101
Winnetka Ave. N., PO# 9437, Minneapolis, MN 55440-9437, 1-800-729-9000. I
have personally been pleased with their service and products but I am in no
way connected with or employed by them other than buying products from them
for the past ten years or so.
goforit!
