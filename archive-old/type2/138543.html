Subject: Should I install that caliper ?

The third caliper i got right now (Cardone 19453 from Kragen) is like the 
second one : the unique bleeder screw would be at the bottom when mounted on 
the right side.

Is that safe ? Can the brakes be bled properly with the bleeder screw at the 
bottom ??

I would really appreciate an answer, I feel so lost now...

Thanks to anyone who takes the time to answer !

Reminder: The object of my quest is a right caliper for a 71 westy.
The old caliper has the bleeder screw at the top of the caliper and the 
pistons cutouts at the bottom. This seems so right.
