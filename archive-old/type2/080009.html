Subject: FS: NOS T4 valve springs and thermo wheels

Sorry to anyone that had expressed prior interest I finally got them
from the guy today, BUT they are better even than I expected, no
doubt they NOS VW as both are still in their original VW boxes and
it is the pre early 70's style logo parts box, this stuff is old and it is
German.  So I probably still have 2 sets of the valve springs, and
5 or so thermo wheels for sale.  The thermo wheels end up being the
ridiculously rare steel ones, never ever crack.  I've only seen a few of
these in my life in fact before this.

So to remind anyone who cares the valve springs are solid lifter 
style and are for sale at $1.50 per spring which is only about ten
cents more each than I paid after shipping. Anyway with say a
priorty pack to anywhere in the US that would be a nice round figure
of $16-17 the set to anyone interested (not sure off hand if they'll go
in the $3.95 or the $5.20 priority pack.) These are the early
021 109 623 E springs suitable for any solid lifter 1.7, 1.8, maybe 2.0 
application, clearly German from VW. Anyway if anyone is interested
obviously not trying to make a lot here, Bus Depot wants $3 each
for these. I have 2 sets to sell.  As the thermo wheels are sort of a
pain to deal with I'll sell them for $7 each including the priority pack
alone or for $3.50 each with a set of springs.  Yeah raised my price
on them but they are NICE.

Happy Holidays
