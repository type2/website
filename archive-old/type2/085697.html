Subject: advice on what to do about a destroyed head and piston--75 Bus 

The valve seat on my #1 intake valve (75 F.I. Bus/1.8L) very suddenly and 
loudly decided to give out and when I finally opened it up to look I saw 
that the shrapnel from what was probably the seat itself gouged serious 
damage in both the head and in the top of the piston.  (Pix are at 
http://www.geocities_dot_com/j_griffin100/ VW_Bus_in_Need.html )
While I don't think any metal got down and past the piston, some did manage 
to lodge between the piston and cylinder wall, binding the two (not totally 
seized, but took a small struggle to free the sleeve).  Once the sleeve was 
out of the way, the rest of the engine appears to turn normally.
Not being very versed in the remedies here-- (and really pretty new to the 
whole bus scene)-- but really wanting to see this otherwise great condition 
bus back on the road, I come seeking advice and answers to a few questions:

On the face of it I need a new head and piston, but...
is there any way to check without too much trouble if anything else is 
damaged?
Is it ok to simply replace one piston and leave the the other 3 alone?
What about the head: ok to touch one and not the other? (I'm pretty sure 
that the PO replaced the other head about 15,000 miles ago) Is a used one an 
option here or do they have to be mated?
Is this the time to think about a replacement engine--hurts to write that 
since everything was going so well till then... Cost?
Anyone have advice on either where to go for parts or where to get a 
reasonably priced replacement engine?  I'm in eastern Connecticut...  thanks 
for any help here...
