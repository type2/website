Subject: RE: [T2] Starter woes

Hi Zach,

I had a very similar problem with my 79 Westy last winter.  It had rained, 
frozen, and snowed overnight, and when I went to start the Bus in the 20-F 
morning, I got nothing.  Good lights, 12.5v on the gauge, fairly new 
hot-start relay; no noise at all from the starter.  I checked all the 
connections, swapped in a different battery, hit the starter with a hammer, 
even bridged the connections with a screwdriver, still nothing.  Thinking 
there was some frozen condensation blocking things, I even heated the 
starter with a torch.  Still nothing.  I was parked at the bottom of a hill 
and couldn't push it, so I went back inside and waited (I was on vacation).  
After about 45min of the sun shining on the of the Bus, I went outside and 
it fired right up.

It started and drove fine the whole rest of the day, and then wouldn't start 
again the next day.  Fortunately I had parked at the top of the hill, so I 
just kick started it and it ran great again.

I have never figured out what the problem was, and it has never repeated 
itself.  As Bob Hoover says, &quot;VWs got a sense of humor...&quot;

Good luck!
