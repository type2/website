Subject: 50th Anniversary Radio Interview in Germany, March 11th

Volks,

A usually reliable source has let me know that on March 11th, in
celebration of the 50th Anniversary of our beloved buses, Knut
Benzner of Deutchland Funk Radio GBS will be presenting a radio show 
on the bus from 2pm to 4pm.  Among the interviewees will be Jerry Jess!
(who will have to be awake and ready at 7AM, Phoenix time :-)

I am also informed that at least one of our list members in Germany will
be taping this program, but I don't know which one :-( First, I am
announcing this so all of you within range have the opportunity to listen
in and (please) tape it, second, if anyone does get a tape of the show, I
would surely love to have a copy!!!

I am also told that there will be a party in Sydney, Australia on March
the 19th in celebration, and would love to learn if any other celebrations
are planned.

Congratulations, Jerry!!!
