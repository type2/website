closer to 40 than 20 :)


i wish i could find some cheap wood.  you get that all put away before 
something happens to it.  staying warm while camping 3 of the past 5 
weekends is getting expensive.  :D

looks like a lot of fun man.  i would have to have two DCs if i had one 
as nice as your 68.  one for driving and one for work-horsing.

peace.
