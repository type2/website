Subject: Re: [T2] need help - vent windows

From Joco Ribeiro:

Seals were my first fear, but now, i've got all that i need...
But, unfortunately, i found that not everything is as easy as i thought....
I need some help in finding the frames that are behind the seals in the vent
windows of the front doors....They are made of iron and mine are completely rusty.
I've posted some pictures in my personal site:
www.jnar_dot_com

 If anyone knows how to get a new pair, please help...
I know that these parts get rusty pretty bad in all VW's so anyone that made an restoration, probably had the
same problem...
I've already sent an e-mail to Justkampers_dot_com but they don't have these kind of parts.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Wow! I have never seen them THAT bad......

I have heard that they are still available new out of Brazil. But they are not cheap.

Good used is your best bet. I try to grab all the nice ones I find. I have a couple of pairs of them right
now. [they are a hot item in Australia. Australian buses came with solid glass]
