Subject: Re: [T2] What's this hole- part 2

I think what you are seeing is the oil pressure regulator spring.

I was used on early 70's Type IV blocks. On later 70's blocks this was not 
used and the hole remained plugged.

I don't think Bentley says much about it but I do this the &quot;How to Rebuild 
Your VW&quot; book (red with the pic of a Type IV longblock on the front) does 
explain it.

&gt;I didn't get the correct answer to my original post, but I've got additional
&gt;information.  The &quot;hole&quot; in my crankcase at #1 cylinder between the pushrod
&gt;tube holes is pluged from the inside with a thin aluminum hollow plug.  I
&gt;looked at other type 4 cases at a local repair shop and it appears that
&gt;there's supposed to be a 12 point plug there.  It's shown on page 5-55 of
&gt;Bentley but no reference number is given, nor is there an explanation of its
&gt;function.  Does anyone know what this is?
