Subject: Re: [T2] one motor, two buses

are you in mystic Ct?, ................ No.
----------------------------------------
My little *as the world turns* story was just my way of suggesting that
you just be patient, build a good engine and by pass the swapping around
routine.
I think we've all got too much experience on pulling engines and Its
never any fun for me.
My current new engine in my 83 Westy has about 10,000 miles on it and I
just changed to synthetic oil on the last oil change.
My last engine lasted over 140,000 miles so I feel I can delay the
swapping routine for a *year or tree* or at least until the current
engine at least is fully broke in (a job for cooler weather).
I don't blame you at all wanting to get the Cooler of the two busses on
the road and have some fun.
Plans are often dreams that don't come true, so swap as you will, you're
eventually going to come up with that second engine.
