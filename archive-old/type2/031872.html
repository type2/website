Subject: New Engine Plan and Question
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.NEB.3.96.981023093026.5233A-100000_at_casiotone.radparker_dot_com&gt;

This winter, I am going to build a mostly stock 1600 Dual Port to be used
in whichever upright-powered bus I buy this Spring.  This is my winter
project.  The goal of this engine is to make it reliable and strong for
alot of miles.  I tend to do alot of driving when I have a bus and want to
know the engine intimately. 

Only modifications I plan on making are as follows: 

	Counterweighted crank from Gene Berg
	New case modified for full-flow from Gene Berg
	Increase capacity of oil sump
	Bosch 009 Distributor

Cam and Exhaust will remain stock.  My question is now, with this setup,
with a stock cam, exhaust, and 009 which carb setup work. 

I am leaning towards a single carb of some kind.  Single carb has less
parts and would make any road side repairs easier.  It is also cheaper. 
The question is which carb?  I know some of the Solex carbs do not work
well with 009's. 

Any comments/suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

- JT
