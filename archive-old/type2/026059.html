&gt; No, you have low oil pressure, most likely. Make SURE you are using either
&gt; 40W (straight 40) oil or possibly synthetic. Owners' manuals are pretty
&gt; specific about this. Get a good brand of straight 40 W racing oil. It's made
&gt; to withstand the heat. The air in the hose will just squeeze and transmit
&gt; the pressure signal to the sender.

Easier to get and probably cheaper is Shell Rotella T diesel engine oil,
which some list members are using now.
