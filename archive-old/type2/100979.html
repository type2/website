&gt; &lt;&lt; But I don't have my bus insured as a collector's/antique. I don't know if I

&gt; what the insurance company gets might not exactly be what I was driving! My
&gt; VDO guages, stereo, and likely the entire engine, will be waiting for a new
&gt; home. That's where all of my money is anyway.

&gt; Careful with collector's/antique insurance...Some only allow you to drive
&gt; a limited number of miles per year, and then only to &quot;events&quot;.

I have my bus insured with an &quot;Assigned Value&quot; policy it only costs me
about $100 more a year for enough to know I really can replace my bus and
I won't have to argue with the insurance company about it. (in theory
anyway)
