Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Spot weld drill bits....

&gt;Hazet makes one. I have no idea who carries it in the U.S. because I got
&gt;mine in Germany, but I would think that any professional tool shop
&gt;should have them.
&gt;
&gt;Order a bunch of extra crowns. They break easily when you are not
&gt;drilling perfectly straight. The rest of the tool (the expensive part)
&gt;is indesrtuctable.

Any paint and body shop supply store carries these for ~$16.
