Subject: oil temps (again)

Hey all:

Sorry to flog this horse yet again but the last time I tried the archives
they weren't working so here goes...

What's a &quot;comfortable&quot; oil temp on an upright engine? The very new, low
compression, Berg engine in my bus will light up the oil temp dipstick if I
cruise the freeway at more than 3,400 rpm, which translates to about 60 I
think (speedometer is way the hell off). The oil temp dipstick is set to
make the light begin to flicker at 225F. By all rights I should be able to
pull 3,800 or even 4 grand with this balanced, smooth running engine. Of
course it was in the upper 80s outside both times I've done extended
highway driving.

Still, I think I should be able to maintain 65 (3,600-3,800) without
harming the engine. Maybe the oil temp would be 230F or so. What's the
upper limit?

I'm using Castrol 20 50, full-flow filter, all stock tin, all seals
present, yada yada yada.
Thanks
Bob
