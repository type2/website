As a novice who did my first spray job on my camper two years ago, I can
offer some advice. First a camper is a big project and needs lots of
preparation, and you really need to have it under cover. I've not got room
in my garage and it took about 2 months outdoors in summer. I got a large
tarpaulin to keep the rain off, but it still rusted here and there as i
worked.

You dont need to go down to bare metal all over, but there will be places
where you'll hit metal. Try and get paint on asap or it'll begin to rust
very fast - not holes or anything but you'll have to sand it all off next
time.

If you hire a spray gun, you'll also need a compressor, and you ought also
to hire other tools like dual action sanders, so check you get a big enough
compressor. I looked at hiring, but in the end bought an old industrial
compressor and got tools from Machine Mart. The spray job you might just do
in a weekend, but the sanding will take a lot longer. You will need to do
some (a lot) of it by hand, but power tools will make it easier. For me one
of the longest jobs  was masking it all up, and I still ended up with paint
where it shouldn't be.

If the body has been rollered, I suspect the PO may not have have been too
fussy about whats underneath so some welding may be in order.

I ended up with a paint job which is superior to what I had, but because I
had to put it all back together in a hurry to go on holiday, it's pretty
poor really and some rust is coming through again.

If you mean to keep the wagon, do it right first time.

Oh and decide on what type of paint to use. Cellulose is quick drying but
shows the runs. You probably need it if you spray outdoors or your paint
will be covered in grit. Yes I know its pretty stupid to try this outside.
Acrylic paint is slower drying but is more forgiving for the novice as it
smooths itself out better.

Good luck
