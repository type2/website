With reguard to the question about FI harness connectors, since the L-Jetronic
injectors all squirt at the SAME time, any of the four connectors could go to
any four of the injectors, but probably only one will reach.

As far as the oil cooler, I had always heard that its okay to reuse it as long
as the engine didnt suffer some sudden failure that would have left metal
pieces floating in the oil.  Supposedly, the metal might never be able to be
cleaned out.  When I rebuilt my '78 2.0, I gave the oil cooler to the guy who
did the machine work and he claims to have flushed it out and leak tested it.
After it was clean, I spent about 3 hours with a piece of coat hanger carefully
straightening the fins, which the PO was somehow able to screw up (or maybe he
paid to have them screwed up at a shop).
