Subject: Fw: [T2] Sliding Door Seal

I wouldn't cut the seal. It's not too hard to remove the top and bottom
rollers on the sliding door one at a time to slip the seal over without
removing the door (easy one person job).
You could even just remove the bottom roller and swing the door out a little
to get the seal over the top and bottom roller, it just requires supporting
the door a little better, but still a one person job.
JUST MAKE sure you mark the current location of the rollers, so you don't
need to re-adjust them afterwards.
Richard,
Brisbane Australia.
