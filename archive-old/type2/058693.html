Subject: UK Campers ?

     Hi folks,
     
     I just got back from Bonnie Scotland, and while hanging out at the 
     base of the William Wallace monument I spotted a number of UK VW 
     campers.  The pop-top is kind of different.  The top did not take up 
     the entire roof, leaving the regular bus roof exposed above the cab 
     and about five inches from the sides all the way round. The whole ran 
     from the same place as the in the US from the front, but at the back 
     it went all the way back to about  2-3 three feet from the back of the 
     bus.  Anybody know anything more about these?
     
     Thanks and up yer kilt
     
     Paul
