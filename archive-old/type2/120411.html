&gt; &gt; hey all,
&gt; &gt;  i was wondering if the pistons and cylinders would fit from an upright engine
&gt; &gt; to a pancake engine and visa versa. thanks.
&gt;
&gt; Simple answer - no, nope, not at all, definitely not.

Wouldn't it matter whether we were talking about a type III pancake or a
type IV pancake?  I think (that's a dangerous thing, I know) that type III
P&amp;Cs were the same as type I P&amp;Cs.
