Subject: Re: Canvas install- why not screw bottom first????

&gt;does the canvas get tighter with
&gt;age??)  -Working &quot;around the corner&quot; to staple the top first and then
&gt;trying to get the right tension/alignment on the bottom with the top
&gt;partially down seems ass backwards.....seems easier in reverse, do the
&gt;bottom first, when you can see what's happening, then staple the top
&gt;under desired tension while sitting inside, working from centers to
&gt;corners.  Then finish with the strip over that, or use any decorative
&gt;trim/webbing/fringe from SO-FRO fabrics.  Only downside is it will show
&gt;from the inside when up- but way up there, who cares- anyone else do it
&gt;this way or care to comment on this method??

I just do what I'm told...I figure after doing it, I would rather have 
gravity in my favor, it's a big enough hassle as it is. I have to admit I 
lost it and totally freaked out once or twice, breaking out in fits of 
explatives while try to stretch the fabric and put the screws in with the 
top fully extended.
