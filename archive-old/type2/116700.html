Subject: RE: removed lock cylinder

Kyle, about a week ago I sent you instructions and recommendations on the 
lock, and noted that the tailpiece was held on by a roll pin.  To get to the 
roll pin, the tailpiece must be extended (it's spring loaded).  Drive the 
roll pin out and the tail piece comes off the lock.  At that point you can 
extract the key through the rear of the lock.  With the tailpiece broken, 
though, it's really pointless to go on.  The long piece in the center is 
what drives the electrical switch.  You might be able to use JB weld and 
re-attach it, but with all you went through, are you willing to chance it 
breaking and letting you down on the road?  Replace the lock.  If you can't 
get the correct one, there are generic locks (different key type, though) 
that will work that can be bought for about 15 bucks from AutoZone and other 
retailers.  Normally we locksmiths would have removed the key through the 
front of the lock.  We have special tools to do this that work nearly all 
the time.  I've never had a VW lock I couldn't get the broken key out of.  
Do it right and replace the lock, or you'll be going down this road 
again...soon.
