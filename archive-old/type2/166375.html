Subject: Re: [T2] cold start problems

The thermo time switch performs a single function of
closing the circuit that operates the cold start
valve. It has two parameters: length of time it will
allow the CSV to operate and maximum temp it will
allow the CSV to operate. Older ones have a lower max
temp than later ones. The temp and time are stamped on
the units. Newer ones allow operation up to 95 degrees
farenheit. Older ones it's 50 degrees. There is a
heating element inside the Thermo time switch that
begins to heat the switch when the starter begins to
turn. The amount of time it takes the heater to heat
the switch unit to its max temp is how long it will
allow the cold start valve to operate - a few seconds.

To test the CSV, you can unplug it, run a jumper from
ground to one terminal in the plug on the CSV; another
jumper to the coil #15 terminal. The book says to
attach a fuel pressure gauge to the port on the fuel
rail and before hooking up these jumpers, to charge
the fuel rail with fuel (which could be from reaching
into the AFMfrom the airfilter side and flipping the
vane open for a few seconds with the switch on or from
running the engine briefly or even just attempting to
start the engine - anyway, you'll see the pressure
gauge at around 30psi) Then hook up your jumpers, turn
the switch ON (not to start position) for a few
seconds, the look at the pressure gauge. If the
pressure has gone away, the cold start valve is
working. Try watching that gauge for a minute or so
first to see if it drops anyway!

To your question: Yes, you could do that. Chances are,
however, when the engine is already at operating temp
you're going to make it so rich it either won't start
or will belch black smoke and barely run. I have had a
cold start valve activate while driving and I had to
find a shoulder immediately as it flat was not gonna
keep running! (at least at any speed - in traffic)

What I did was to run a power supply to one side and
then run a wire to the dashboard and used a pushbutton
(momentary) switch (like the old starter switches) to
close the circuit to ground. That way I could activate
the cold start valve at any time. It comes in handy
for passing and a little extra boost on hills - times
a little enrichening will actually help. I used it
together with another mixture control circuit to
enable using that last quarter of throttle that the
fuel injection system doesn't give you enough fuel for
- like 90mph on up!

I had gone through all the tests for the thermo time
switch, decided that it was defective, got another one
and installed it knowing that it had worked last time
it was run... It did not work, so I decided it was a
wiring harness issue and ran my manual control from
then on - for about 5 years.

I agree that this is probably not your particular
problem, as it should start without the CSV in most
any conditions. I also suggest checking hoses... All
the &quot;formed&quot; hoses in the engine compartment are
suspect. They will blow off or fall out at a railroad
crossing or other bump, and because they are &quot;formed&quot;
they appear to still be connected. You have to
physically grab hold of each of them and confirm that
it is seated at both ends. They also deteriorate badly
on the heat-source side and sometimes the air bypass
valve hoses have only a top - no bottom side at all!
They look like a hose, but if you grab hold, it will
crumble to dust! That is just to the right of the air
plenum and buried mostly out of sight. It is also a
start related item as it opens a valve to allow more
&quot;counted&quot; air into the plenum until its heater element
heats up enough to close the valve. It is the fast
idle circuit and that's all it does. -BaH

 My 78 FI Bus will not start without using a starting
 fluid(ether).   Last 
 year I replaced the thermo time switch.    I want to
 check its condition in case 
 it has gone bad.   I have   a resistance of 35 ohms
 cold (ice cold ) and 70 
 ohms warm (over 35 C).   It seems it should have no
 resistance when cold and 
 infinite when hot, if I understand how it is made
 and works.   Is a valid way to 
 test it to jump the terminals of the connector to it
 so that ground is sent to 
 the cold start valve all the time the starter is
 cranking the engine.   It 
 might be a bit rich when warm but I would think
 opening the throttle should be 
 able to cope with additional fuel.    What do people
 think of trying this.   It 
 might at the worst confirm a bad thermo time switch
 or tell me I should look 
 else where, such as spark (have not tested, but as
 it runs after starting I 
 think this is probably not the problem.   Thanks for
 any and all advice
