Subject: Re: [T2] muffler heat?

on 7/14/04 11:06, Dave C. Bolen related:

&gt; Folks, 
&gt; 
&gt; I have a question about muffler heat.  In my 78, I have converted to
&gt; the 72-74 style of heater boxes/muffler.  All shields and flappers and
&gt; everything else is in place and working.  The muffler is a stock stainless
&gt; steel one from BD correct for the 72-74 setup.
&gt; 
&gt; However, my rear bumper gets really really hot!  Is this normal?

dave,

my rear bumper gets hot also. not sure i'd say it gets REALLY hot, but it is
hot to the touch. i have 72-74 system on my 79. i can't remember how not it
got before i switched over, as i too didn't drive it much.

i can see the muffler getting hotter with a 72-74 system than with stock
75-78 or 79. the exhaust inside the muffler on the stock setup takes a much
longer path: it has passed through the elbows, plus the crossover before it
enters the muffler, so 75-78 muffler exhaust should be cooler. i would also
not be surprised if the shiny stainless muffler you have radiates more heat
than my matte black one, or a stock gray painted one, though i am not
certain if my physics is correct on this point.
