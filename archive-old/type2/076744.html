Subject: GEX Update Question...


Audacious peers,
Hello. I have been reading the (horror) stories about GEX products in the 
archives, and since i recently put a set of the larger valve (gex) heads on 
my 2.0L Type4 motor...I have come to question. So, has GEX improved quality 
standards, or is the concensus still that they are a brand worth 
sidestepping? I've heard rumors that they often charge for upgraded internal 
parts on turnkeys, that are not actually the product that you paid for. 
Should i hold my breath on these rebuilt heads?
What's the vote out there??
-Jeremy
