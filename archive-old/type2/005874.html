Leslie,

I'm not overtly familiar with pancakes, but I'll give it a shot... at least,
I'll ask a whole bunch of questions ;)
What exactly do mushroomed tappets indicate? I'd guess that the hydraulics,
over time, took up the slack that they were designed to do. After many
years, they can fall out of the general *initial* adjustment, get worn
clearances on their insides, or get crudded up on the insides.
    If they are doing their job, great... If they are too tight, you can get
backfires out the exhaust (exhaust ones stay open, let more unburned
particules (sic.) down the exhaust manifold) and low or no power. If they
are too loose, the whole train clatters. Worn but usable ones clatter at
startup but quiet down as oil pressure builds...
    But why the mushrooming?
    Could a hydraulic problem cause the hydraulic lifter to &quot;engage&quot; (i.e.
set itself to a certain effective length) more harshly than usual? Unlikely,
IMHO...
    Or could it be a problem that surfaced due to a rebuild error...?
    Wrong valve train geometry? (Unfamiliar with how to go about setting
valve train geometry on hydraulics-equipped engines...)
    Cold it be a spring problem? Wrong spring pressure (springs too strong?)
(springs shimmed too much?)
    Or is it a valve problem...? IIRC, valve stem tips are hardened...
Grinding the tips too much with the tipping function of a valve grinding
machine would then get it into the soft metal... worse if someone forgot to
chamfer the stem tip, too...
    Whatever the cause, you can be sure that the same forces that were
causing the mushrooming at the tappet area were acting with similar
determination between the camshaft lobes and the lifters... IMHO, the
camshaft will be declared unusable when the case is split and the cam
extricated. (I think this especially valid considering that this camshaft is
on it's second, maybe third, set of lifters w/o splitting the case).
    I would lean towards removing all of the lifters for an attempt at a
visual inspection of the camshaft lobes. That, and an effective lift (???
I'm forgetting the proper term, I know...) check using a dial indicator to
see how much lift each cam lobe will provide. If the cam is on it's last
legs, it would be futile to install a new set of lifters/adjusters/etc... at
this point.

I have a 1980 Vanagon air-cooled: I have removed the rocker shafts and a
visual inspection of the tappets reveals that all are worn - one worn flat
and mushroomed.  The Haynes Repair Manual states that if metal particles
are found in the sump (I believe I have found some of the mushrooming metal
there), that the hydraulic lifters should be disassembled and cleaned.

My question is - Would it be better to install all new lifters and at the
same time new tappets?  If I purchase new lifters, is it necessary to
disassemble and bleed them before installing?  Are the tappets case
hardened and when this wears through, is this the cause of the mushrooming?
I had a local mechanic install new lifters a time back, I believe it was
his shoddy work that caused the pushrod tubes to leak which is why I am in
there now. I had considerable noise from the tappets and a lot of noise
when the oil was down to the add mark, which happened  often due to the oil
leak. Is there any hope for this motor, It seems to run strong and another
mechanic recently checked it over and told me it was ready for a 7000 mile
trip!
