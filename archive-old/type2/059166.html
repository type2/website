Subject: RE: westy Floor question
Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Just my $.02,
I recently aquired a '67 Westy, pulled it out of a neighbor's back yard,
washed off the mold growing on it, etc (another story). Someone a long time
ago had decided that the interior would look nice with deep, orange shag
carpeting. needles to say, removing this required something just short of a
gas mask. Beneath this mess was a flooring base of 3/8&quot; plywood. It came
out in de-laminated layers. The floor beneath is still sporting the
original coating applied the factory before it became a Westy. So the
plywood acts as a moisture barrier in both directions (hence the tight
fit). Also, if you've ever laid a linolium floor, it looks great when you
put it down but all to soon it finds every little bump or dip in the base
(this is experience talking). If you don't start with a good (use exterior)
plywood base, your floor will soon show every detail of the floor panel in
your bus.
Hope this helps!
