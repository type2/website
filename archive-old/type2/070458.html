Subject: Bumper Chopping

Hi Volks,
  I can't understand why people chop their bumpers up like that.
I've been running with a bug muffler on the '71 forever.  All you
have to do is bend the pipes down about an inch. Very quiet compared
to the muffler that was on there before.  Also, the bug muffler doesn't
turn the bumper black.  Or am I just running too rich?  An old timer
told me that the mufflers that came on the bus don't have enough
back pressure to keep the engine from running rough?  Is that factual?
That same guy also told me that using an impact wrench on the axle nut
is fine, also using it to loosen the flywheel nut is fine, but never, ever
tighten the flywheel(gland) nut with one.  It will break it off in there
faster than you can say VW   =:O

      Drive On,  Chris  '69, '71 Westys etc.
