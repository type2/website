Subject: Online source for metric sized products

I just found an online source for metric sized products (tools, fasteners,
etc....):  Maryland Metric at:

www.mdmetric_dot_com

While the index makes the site look comprehensive, I haven't tried to use it
and have had no experience with the company.  Nonetheless, it looks like
a potentially useful site to bookmark.
