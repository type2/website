Missy:
No, you have low oil pressure, most likely. Make SURE you are using either
40W (straight 40) oil or possibly synthetic. Owners' manuals are pretty
specific about this. Get a good brand of straight 40 W racing oil. It's made
to withstand the heat. The air in the hose will just squeeze and transmit
the pressure signal to the sender.
No problem.

&gt; Also...my new oil pressure sender appears to be
&gt; working, and here's the other question.  When I'm at a
&gt; stoplight at idle (automatic,) my oil pressure idiot
&gt; light comes on.  Now, i have to run a lead wire for
&gt; the dash gauge...so I don't know what pressure I'm
&gt; usually running at.  Is this normal?  Or is it just a
&gt; matter of pouring some extra oil down in the extension
&gt; hose that I used?  Is the oil having issues getting to
&gt; the sender due to the extension?
