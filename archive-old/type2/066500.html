Subject: Re: Cleanin' ol' brake drums.

&gt;Since I would rather not turn the drums now if at all possible, what
&gt;are the pros an cons of using a very fine grit [say 600-1000] wet
&gt;paper to clean the inside surface rust off the drums?  Is this a
&gt;definite bad idea...or am I just being overly cautious?

Overly cautious. You can go to Sears and get a brake drum hone if you want.
Looks like a cylinder hone, but tinier stones.
