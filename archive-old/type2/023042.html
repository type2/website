&gt;David, what do you use as insulation for your under-bus oil temperature
&gt;sender wire?  I've always wondered about that little detail and have never
&gt;seen anything about it here.  (If anyone else has input to this, please
&gt;contribute as well.)  Thanks!

I just used regular automotive grade wire from the FLAPS and put it inside 
the flexible black plastic harness-tubing stuff.  I have about half a dozen 
wires going back for various things.  I routed the harness through the 
holes in the frame and ziptied it where needed.  Brought it up to the cab 
next to the heater pipe.
