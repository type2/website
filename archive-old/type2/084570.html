&gt;According to their website the melting temp is 200 degrees F. Do you think
&gt;the body panels can get this hot on the inside or is this maybe an
&gt;overstatement of the max temperature?

Not sure.  I certainly think that panels can approach that temperature in 
direct sunlight.  There also might be some room for interpretation in the 
definition of &quot;melting&quot;.  What I experienced might be closer to say, 
&quot;substantial softening&quot; which was enough to cause it to no longer hold its 
shape and to emit nasty tar smells.  It wasn't melted in the sense that I 
could suck it up with a siphon.  That place used to send out samples for a 
few bucks - if they still do, that would be a good way to safely find out 
if it will work for you.  I will continue to discourage the use of this 
product as long as people will listen.  Again, I am only refering to the 
adhesive product with the blue plastic backing with the weave pattern on it 
that they refer to as &quot;blue&quot; (but I would want to try the other too before 
buying).
