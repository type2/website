Subject: Re: V joint 1/2shaft compatible with 76

I hate to disagree (or it could be the dyslexia) with the Co-administrator,
Mr. Dolan, but I must.  The 68-72 shaft is a different length than the
73-79.  The 68-72 is about a 1/2 inch shorter than the 73-79.  Last year I
stripped the stub axle on my 72 and ordered one through Ronnie of
Type2parts_dot_com and the one he sent was the 73-79 and I did not notice the
length difference till after I tried to tighten the nut down and would not
tighten anymore and still had a gap so I pulled it off and laid it next to
the stripped axle and it was longer so I called Ronnie and he sent another
(the right one) no charge

&gt; I *know* that '73-'79 are identical. I *think* that '68-'72 are also
&gt; identical wiht the '73-79 and I *know* that vanagon shafts are *not*
&gt; identical.  The CV's are the same, but the half shafts are different
&gt; (longer on the V'gon, I think, but that could be my dyslexia speaking :-)
