&gt;The problem is that the magnet sleeve doesn't fit down far enough on the
&gt;distributor shaft to allow the rotor to settle into its place.  It looks to

&gt;&quot;shoulders&quot; that help orient the sleeve on the rotor shaft, but I'd guess
&gt;they also are preventing the sleeve from descending.
&gt;
&gt;How have others dealt with this?

It's a common problem. I think folks just take a knife and make as few alterations to the sleeve as possible to get it to fit. Mine went on without any mods so you have to chock it up to manufacturing goofs perhaps.
