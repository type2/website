Subject: Re: [T2] 1977 westy mpg?

I have always seen coil/plugs as OK or KO devices. Either it works or not.
Maybe that is wrong...
Has anyone played with gapping and noticed any difference ? Or has anyone
seen a noticeable gas mileage difference after just swapping a coil.
The 1971 westy averages about 18mpg and that is with a light right foot.
(Trying to not kick the accel pump in)
The 1971 westy has something that looks like a blue BOSH coil on it. And If
I remember well Bosh plugs.
