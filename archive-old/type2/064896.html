&gt;I heard a horrible story the other day......vw destroys
&gt;parts!  parts we need and want...are to be destroyed....so that we'll 
&gt;have no option but to order our parts from vw exclusively .  Dosnt 
&gt;that make u mad!!!!!!

Very mad indeed.  It seems they are destroying parts that they will just 
have to manufacture at a higher cost which, of course, will be 
passed back to us...&lt;sigh&gt;.  My engine came from a warehouse in 
Canada that VW sold out to some company.  They were supposed to 
&quot;dispose&quot; of these engines, so I got a 'factory fresh' which was 
simply all new engine parts put together!  A brand new engine!  :)
