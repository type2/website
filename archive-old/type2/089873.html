Subject: oil collecting in the air filter

hello, i have a 75 westy with a 79 2000cc engine with what i believe is an 
aftermarket carborator.  the problem is that oil has been collecting in the 
air filter.  i ran a compression test on all 4 cylinders and it passed with 
flying colors.  is the engine supposed to have positve crankcase pressure?  
is there a baffle or filter or valve to stop oil from collecting int eh air 
filter?  why is there positive crankcase pressure?  any help would be 
appreciated.  thanks!
