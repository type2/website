Subject: Re: [T2] Re-calibrating AFM?

Over time the spring resisting the twist of the air vane inside the AFM
weakens.  This leads to an over-rich running situation.  The spring can
weaken to the point that no amount of adjustment to the basic air/fuel
mixture at the AFM can bring the ratio back to what it should be.  At this
point many people open up the AFM and tighten the spring in order to get the
air/fuel ratio back to spec.

&gt; Why would you want to do this? Is it because something is wrong with
&gt; your FI system? Or is it because you want to tinker with the specs?

&gt; &gt; I'm wondering whether anyone has had any success re-calibrating the
&gt; &gt; AFM on a fuel injected bus to obtain proper air/fuel mixture.  Is this
&gt; &gt; simply a matter of moving the spring holder inside to increase or
&gt; &gt; decrease spring tension.
