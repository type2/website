&gt; My philosophy on getting a new bus is that the best way to go about
&gt; it is to find the best body that you can.  Look for rust-free, look
&gt; for straight, look for a nice interior, look for &quot;all parts 
&gt; present.&quot;

&gt; Ok that was cheep.  But funny.

LOL, cheap, but very funny. I think it might be a case of &quot;do as I
say, not as I do&quot; 8-)

John Henry webmaster of http://www.geocities_dot_com/thebugshop writes
that you should buy solid, complete, correct and original. This is
written in his &quot;what to look for when buying&quot; a b_at__at_tle article, but
alot of the concepts apply to buying an old bus. Just insert BUS
where ever you see the word B_at_G, and if he starts talking about
heater channels think frame/outriggers/jackpoints.

A excellent article for anyone thinking about buying any old veedub.
