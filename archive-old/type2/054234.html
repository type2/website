Subject: Pulling ot the right when braking

I have an interesting thing that occurs with my 70' Dormobile. When I apply 
my brakes for the first time after starting, (and only the first time), my 
front end pulls to the right. It won't happen again that day, even if the bus 
sits for hours. Any ideas? I've searched the library and archives but didn't 
find anything.
