Subject: squeek no more

 Thanks to all the people who contributed suggestions, I have now conquered
the squeek!!.
After drowning all the rubber bushings in various sprays, I took to the ball
joints. I drilled and tapped them and installed grease nipples.  a shot of
Molybdenum grease and the squeek is gone! Woohoo!
It shows me just how inadequate sealed ball joints are.
Now to attack that fan heater box.......I wonder where I should put the
grease nipple..............
