 Hi volks,

 Karl writes (on locating pins):

&gt; They were discontinued in the early 70's.

 OK. I'll just cover the holes.. :-)


Me&gt;  Finally, when should the drums be ditched- mine had some
Me&gt; surface corrosion and the above mentioned lip caused by
Me&gt; wear to the working faces, but they seemed to clean up
Me&gt; OK (and still have quite a bit of thickness in the metal).
Me&gt;  I didn't see a minimum thickness spec. in the Haynes,
Me&gt; but I presume there is one?

Karl again:

&gt; Yes there is a wear limit. It should be cast in the outer surface of the
&gt; drum. ..

 Hmm, that's corroded off..

&gt; ... On 71 and up:
&gt; New: 252 mm  [9.920'']
&gt; Wear limit: 253.50 mm  [9.980'']
&gt; Permissible turned diameter: 253 mm [9.960'']

 Right- excellent, thanks very much for the info.
 That's obviously the internal diameter of the drum. Should I 
be concerned about loss of material from the outside of the drums
(due to rust flaking), or is it likely to be OK, as long as it hasn't
flaked off to nothing and the inside faces spec. out?
 I've painted the drums to avoid further deterioration, BTW.

Cheers,
	W.
