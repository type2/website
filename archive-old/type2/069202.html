Remove the valves, clean the head (REALLY clean), put it in the oven and heat
to 450 degrees (about one hour).  Put on welding gloves or oven mitts, grab
the stud with pre-adjusted vise-grips (sacrifice the stud).  

When the head is hot, the exhaust studs usually come out quite easily.

If you must re-thread the bore to 10mm, do so with a 'minus' tap.  (Taps come
in three sizes, one a little bit under-size, one standard size and one a
little bit over-size.  You want to use the small one.)

To install, heat the re-threaded head, chill the replacement stud, torque
together.
