Subject: Confusing distributor mark

I have a 1976 FI Bus.  The distributor is not the
original one which came with the bus.  It is running
ok, but has a problem idling, seems like it is missing
occasionally.

My question is: The mark on the rim of the distributor
is seems to be 180 degrees away from where it should
be. If I am looking down on top of the  distributor
and I point it so the vacuum unit is straight out to
the right, then it looks like (relative to the hands
of a clock):

Vacuum unit: 3 o'clock -- straight out to the right
Notch for distributor cap: 6 o'clock -- straight down
Condenser: 1 o'clock 
Points: 10 o'clock
Mark on rim of distributor: 11 o'clock
The distributor pictures in the Haynes book (page 61,
chapter 3 section 2) all show the mark on the rim at
about 5 o'clock.

If I wanted to use the mark, I would have to either:

Rotate the distributor 180 degrees (I don't think
there is room to do this, the vacuum advance will hit
the manifold)

or

Switch the spark plug wires so the wires from the left
side of the distributor go the 1 and 2 cylinders on
the right side of the engine, and the wires from the
right side of the distributor goto the 3 and 4
cylinders on the left side of the engine.

Do I have a real distributor ? Are my wires backwards
?
What's going on ?

Distributionally confused, 

David
