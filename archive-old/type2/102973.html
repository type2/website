Subject: Re: [T2] great door speaker location!!!

Hi Volks,

There are as many perfect speaker locations as there are buses and 
stereos.  Most locations have pluses and minuses, it depends on what 
you have to work with and what you are trying to achieve.

Jamie Rivers carefully drilled a grille pattern into the dash of his 
bus and repainted with semigloss black paint. He then installed a pair 
of 3&quot;x9&quot; speakers which sound terrific and you would NEVER know it 
isn't stock. He had to shop around a bit to find the right speakers but 
they do exist.

I started with a pair of 6&quot; speakers in the front kick plates. Nice 
tone, but impossible for passengers to hear from the back seat.

Next I put a set of 6x9's into the face of the customer full-width 
Z-bed, which improved the sound dramatically. But on family trips these 
speakers were usually blocked by the coolers, etc. that fill my bus, 
and at highways peeds they were hard to hear.

The most recent addition was a pair of 4x9's in a custom rear valance 
that replaced the housing over the rear hatch springs. These are always 
easy to hear  and the valance matches the interior scheme of the bus 
nicely.

I'm thinking about putting an amp and subwoofer under the rear-facing 
seat next. Must Have More Power.....;^)

My CB radio is in a console unit I built to fit between the front 
seats, (see the first picture) but on the highway I found it really 
hard to hear. After installing a 6&quot; speaker into the stock dash speaker 
location we hear the CB perfectly now.

Happy trails,

&gt; Thanks Christopher,
&gt;
&gt; I'm trying to utilize my front speaker balance.  I've got a CD player 
&gt; and some Pioneer 6x9's in the back, under rear seat - no middle seat 
&gt; installed.  Need some front speakers to fill it all in.  As of present 
&gt; I have to blast, 80% to 90% max., the rear speakers to get over the 
&gt; road  noise.  Windows are always open - unless raining, fortunately 
&gt; it's always warm :-) .
&gt;
&gt; The previous owner had some speakers mounted low, as you describe in 
&gt; your original post.  I  made new front door panels when cleaning up 
&gt; the bus.
&gt; I have also kicked around the idea of trying to mount two small 
&gt; speakers under the dash, but not in the front kick plates.  Space is 
&gt; limited....
