I have the axle out that was making noise.
Problem is I have 2 other axles in a box that I picked up at a mechanics 
liquidation sale and I don't remember which one is good because I mixed an 
old one up I had.

Can I tell if there good without taking them apart and how?

It was pretty clear with the one I just took out on the wheel side..old caked 
grease, when I held the axle I could jiggle the CV back and forth and It made 
a bit of the knocking sound.

Thanks
