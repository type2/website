Hey are there other any other canucks out there?
   If so, tired of paying american exchange on bug or bus parts? Well
there is a chain of stores that carry used and NOS parts in British
Columbia. They deliver pretty much anywhere in the world and have almost
everything. These guys saved my butt lots so I figure I owe it to them
for bit of adervertising!.
   Anyway they have a great online  catalog, so check it out. The place
is called Bow-Wow parts of B.C. LTD. www.bowwow_at_bowwow_dot_ca.
