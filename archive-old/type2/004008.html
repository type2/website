If it's an SIR engine you proly have one of those little round heat tabs
right under the dizzy with a small piece in the center that is supposed to
melt at 255 degrees.  Has that piece melted? If it has you have obviously
(as Jake said) gotten it hot.  I would do a compression test on it , and
then proceed from there.

&gt; Sounds like the engine is getting hot, and tightening the valves from
&gt; constant expansion and compression, a normal and deadly behavior from a
type
&gt; 1 engine, in a bus, with rebuilt heads....
&gt;
&gt; The valves will begin to stretch, and drop, or they will drop a seat..Find
&gt; out why the engine is getting hot, and the problem will be solved with a
&gt; valve adjustment....
&gt;
&gt; I see this all the time!

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Argh!
&gt; &gt; My 71 westy (1600 DP)with an S.I.R. rebuild with only 8000 miles on it
is
&gt; &gt; driving me crazy. I went to do my routine valve adjustment, which I have
&gt; &gt; done dozens of times since buying the bus last year, driving around the
&gt; &gt; country, blowing 2 engines (long story). So I think I know what I'm
doing
&gt; &gt; with regards to valve adjustment - the bread and butter of VW
maintenance.
&gt; &gt; Anyway, I started by checking and torqueing the head bolts (all a little
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; a fair amount loose - maybe 14ftlb to 22 ft lbs. -0 of course only the
&gt; lower
&gt; &gt; 4 on each, I know that will cause some controvery since some say you
MUST
&gt; do
&gt; &gt; all 8 with engine out...anyway I get equal number of opposite opinions
on
&gt; &gt; this) then I put on the rocker arms, torqued those, then adjusted
valves.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Valve 1 intake  and exhaust ok,
&gt; &gt; Valve 2 intake too tight(adj. screw out - no feeler gauge will fit), but
&gt; &gt; after unbolting and rebolting rockers ok, 2 exhaust ok,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Then - 3 intake and exhaust - NO WAY CAN I GET A GAUGE IN! even with
&gt; taking
&gt; &gt; out the screw. I take the rocker arms off a few times, carefully try to
&gt; make
&gt; &gt; sure push rods are seated well - no luck. I even crank the engine a few
&gt; &gt; times to see if they will reseat and loosen up - but no dice. And to
make
&gt; &gt; matters worse - I look at #2 and the push rod had come off the rocker
arm
&gt; &gt; alltogether!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Frustrated, I take the rocker arms from heads off my old engine (the new
&gt; &gt; heads had only 3000 miles on them. They look so nice, you know?) I was
&gt; &gt; careful putting them on , carefully unscrewing all the adjusting screws
so
&gt; &gt; as not to crunch a valve, #1 intake - first one I look at- now will not
&gt; &gt; allow me to put a gauge in, even with screw out. I take out rocker arms
&gt; &gt; again a few times - still can't get a gauge in.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What gives? What am I doing wrong? I could shim the rocker arms to get
the
&gt; &gt; adjustment, but that doesn't seem to fix the problem or discover what
I'm
&gt; &gt; doing wrong.
&gt; &gt; Before doing all this, the bus ran fine, except minor idling problems,
&gt; which
&gt; &gt; I attribute to valve adjustments and maybe idle/fuel/air screws...
&gt; &gt; HELP PLEASE - I'm trying to get on the road for a couple of weeks...
