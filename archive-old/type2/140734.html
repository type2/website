Subject: RE: Carb Flooding

I floor the throttle because it can take several minutes to unflood the
engine and I'm trying to give it all the air I can. The extra fuel from the
accelerator pump I don't think compares with the massive flood of fuel
already in the engine. As for it roaring to a high rpm after starting that
is not a problem as it sputters for several seconds on one or two cylinders
before the others pick up. Today I'm going to try to look down the carb to
see if I can see where it is leaking from.

Your problems sound similar to mine but not as bad. I was hoping there was
somebody out there that knew a cure for this. I will probably just end up
throwing a new carb at the problem as that seems to fix it for a few months.
And my new engine is fully balanced so maybe the wear and tear on the carb
will be less and hopefully last longer.

Thanks for the input,

&gt; Hi Ray,
&gt;
&gt; I have the same engine as yours except with the stock mechanical pump. I
&gt; have the same symptoms on hot days after the engine is hot. I have learned
&gt; to anticipate when it will probably be hard to start and before turning
&gt; the engine over I press the throttle about 3/4ths and then turn the key.
&gt; It usually starts within about 7 seconds (for comparison, when the engine
&gt; is cold it usually starts in about 1 second). I have found it important to
&gt; absolutely not vary the position of the throttle once I have pressed it to
&gt; the 3/4 point until the engine starts.
&gt; I think my reasoning to go to the 3/4 point rather than full throttle is
&gt; to minimize any accelerator pump squirt compounding an already possibly
&gt; flooded situation. Also so that when the engine does fire up, it doesn't
&gt; roar immediately to full throttle.
&gt; Also, after about an hour (or less), mine starts like it normally would
&gt; when cold and i don't have to press the throttle in advance. So if you
&gt; still have sypmtoms after several hours, the electric fuel pumps might be
&gt; causing additional flooding over what is encountered in the mechanical
&gt; system.
