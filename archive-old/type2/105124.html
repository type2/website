Subject: Re: [VB] What H4's is everyone using in ther Buses?

Dave,

I'm running the 55/100W bulbs that I picked up from aircooled_dot_net.

They are unbelievably bright, no relays either.  Just plugged them in and turned them on.  I use my high beams quite a bit and for extended lengths of time with no ill effects.

The light pattern is awesome compared to the previous sealed beams.
