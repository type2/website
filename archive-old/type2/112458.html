Subject: Re: [T2] Different Seats how about recarros?

&lt;&lt; I'm curious myself! I have a pair of lovely black leather
recarro seats from a BMW 325is, that I am wanting to
install in my '78 westy....but have not taken out the stock
ones to have a look as to how difficult it will be. I
assume it will be simply a matter of making an adaptor
plate for each rail with appropriate holes.....anyone??
 &gt;&gt;

Check the height of the seat's seat...I'm just 6' 1&quot; and even in
the stock seats I'm looking out thru' the top of the windshield.
I added a couple of computer fans to blow whatever warm air
there is to defrost the viewing area...
