Subject: Re: [T2] Van towed, now won't start

Hi Maira,

Is that click coming from the starter? Check for voltage at the +  
terminal of the coil when the key is on. If there is none, then you  
have an ignition switch/wiring issue.

If you do have voltage at the coil, check for voltage at the starter  
terminals. If no voltage at the ignition wire connected to the  
starter then there is an issue with the ignition switch.

It shouldn't make any difference if the van was in gear when towed  
since the rear wheels would be off the ground the whole time.

At the base of the steering column is a rubber bushing. If it is torn  
or damaged it could account for the play in the steering.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; I have a '73 bus which was recently towed for some unpaid tickets.  
&gt; I have it back now, but it won't start despite many hours spent  
&gt; under the dashboard deciphering cryptic wiring diagrams... Help!
&gt;
&gt; Here are some relevant details:
&gt; *Just makes a &quot;click&quot; sound when key is turned
&gt; *Towers began towing from the front but then switched to a rear tow  
&gt; when a concerned &quot;witness&quot; told  them frontal tow was a bad idea.(I  
&gt; wasn't there or I would have jumped into my van and refused to get  
&gt; out like the crazy dame that I am. It worked once, anyway! :)
&gt; *Van was in gear when towed.
&gt; *Steering lock is no more since the tow and steering column seems  
&gt; somehow looser than before
&gt; *Turn signal switch was in a state of &quot;mid-replacement&quot; when the  
&gt; tow happened, so I was already a little confused on the wiring up  
&gt; there...
&gt;
&gt; My mechanically inclined friends and I have tinkered with (actually  
&gt; replaced) the starter and the battery is new. I'm really suspecting  
&gt; a ignition switch problem. Could the towing trauma have caused this  
&gt; damage? What happens when a van like mine is towed from the rear  
&gt; while in gear?
