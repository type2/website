AIRS just rocks. Thanks for all the hard word on the part of Wade the
Webmaster and also all the casa-y-driveway volunteers...oh also Charlie the
AIRS Official Big Galoot and Inspiration.

I'm thinking there needs to be an easy way to print out the AIRS list. By
&quot;easy&quot; I mean easily found (easily remembered URL) and also easily printed.
Probably a PDF file. The goal being that you can get it printed out from
any platform, from any Kinko's or public library or Internet Cafe or AIRS
member.

Naturally I did not post this in order to volunteer myself. =^ )

Tell me if I need a tin foil hat.

&gt;After I get finished updating the AIRS site, I sit next to the phone, hand
&gt;on the receiver just WAITING to pick it up first ring.....and now i have
&gt;missed my chance. A lady from tuscon called me saying she was driving up to
&gt;phoenix and was in trouble. She needed some parts or a shop to go to. And I
&gt;wasnt home. At least my girlfriend was, and she gave her directions of where
&gt;she could go, so thats good. Ah well, maybe ill get it next time! *grumble
&gt;grumble* =)
&gt;Anyways - updated the site with new submissions, stories, tire info, and
&gt;added a navibar for easier navigation.
&gt;Thanx for all the great emails, stories and support I have received!
&gt;currently 556 members.. we're gettin about 20-30 new submissions a month
