&gt;  Does anyone know where I can get a spacer for a 34-Pict 3 carb?
&gt;  I need to get it up some to keep the linkage from hitting the alternator.
&gt;  Would it be easier to grind material from the alternator?

Hi Steven,

My original 34 PICT 3 did not interfere with the alternator. But a 
replacement one did.

Examination and comparison between the two carbs showed that the linkage 
which operates the accelerator pump could be reversed (operating inside of 
the plate that turns with the accelerator rather than outside) so that it did 
not foul the aternator. However I could not get the little split washer that 
held the linkage together off very easily so I gave up trying and simply used 
the one of the old carb which was the other way round.

However without two carbs to compare this reverseal may not be very obvious.

Good luck
